If there be any prestige  or authority in such matter from the accomplishment of a first complete  ascent, \"if there be any virtue, if there be any praise,\" the author  values it chiefly as it may give weight to this plea.    It is now little more than seventeen years ago that a prospector  penetrated from the south into the neighborhood of this mountain,  guessed its height with remarkable accuracy at twenty thousand feet,  and, ignorant of any name that it already bore, placed upon it the name  of the Republican candidate for President of the United States at the  approaching election--William McKinley. No voice was raised in protest,  for the Alaskan Indian is inarticulate and such white men as knew the  old name were absorbed in the search for gold. Some years later an  officer of the United States army, upon a reconnoissance survey into the  land, passed around the companion peak, and, alike ignorant or careless  of any native name, put upon it the name of an Ohio politician, at that  time prominent in the councils of the nation, Joseph Foraker. So there  they stand upon the maps, side by side, the two greatest peaks of the  Alaskan range, \"Mount McKinley\" and \"Mount Foraker.\" And there they  should stand no longer, since, if there be right and reason in these  matters, they should not have been placed there at all.    To the relatively large Indian population of those wide regions of the  interior of Alaska from which the mountains are visible they have always  borne Indian names. The natives of the middle Yukon, of the lower three  hundred miles of the Tanana and its tributaries, of the upper Kuskokwim  have always called these mountains \"Denali\" (Den-ah'li) and \"Denali's  Wife\"--either precisely as here written, or with a dialectical  difference in pronunciation so slight as to be negligible.    It is true that the little handful of natives on the Sushitna River, who  never approach nearer than a hundred miles to the mountain, have another  name for it. They call it _Traleika_, which, in their wholly different  language, has the same signification. It is probably true of every great  mountain that it bears diverse native names as one tribe or another, on  this side or on that of its mighty bulk, speaks of it. But the area in  which, and the people by whom, this mountain is known as Denali,  preponderate so greatly as to leave no question which native name it  should bear. The bold front of the mountain is so placed on the  returning curve of the Alaskan range that from the interior its snows  are visible far and wide, over many thousands of square miles; and the  Indians of the Tanana and of the Yukon, as well as of the Kuskokwim,  hunt the caribou well up on its foot-hills. Its southern slopes are  stern and forbidding through depth of snow and violence of glacial  stream, and are devoid of game; its slopes toward the interior of the  country are mild and amene, with light snowfall and game in abundance.    Should the reader ever be privileged, as the author was a few years ago,  to stand on the frozen surface of Lake Minchumina and see these  mountains revealed as the clouds of a passing snow-storm swept away, he  would be overwhelmed by the majesty of the scene and at the same time  deeply moved with the appropriateness of the simple native names; for  simplicity is always a quality of true majesty. Perhaps nowhere else in  the world is so abrupt and great an uplift from so low a base. The  marshes and forests of the upper Kuskokwim, from which these mountains  rise, cannot be more than one thousand five hundred feet above the sea.  The rough approximation by the author's aneroid in the journey from the  Tanana to the Kuskokwim would indicate a still lower level--would make  this wide plain little more than one thousand feet high. And they rise  sheer, the tremendous cliffs of them apparently unbroken, soaring  superbly to more than twenty thousand and seventeen thousand feet  respectively: Denali, \"the great one,\" and Denali's Wife. And the little  peaks in between the natives call the \"children.\" It was on that  occasion, standing spellbound at the sublimity of the scene, that the  author resolved that if it were in his power he would restore these  ancient mountains to the ancient people among whom they rear their  heads. Savages they are, if the reader please, since \"savage\" means  simply a forest dweller, and the author is glad himself to be a savage a  great part of every year, but yet, as savages, entitled to name their  own rivers, their own lakes, their own mountains. After all, these  terms--\"savage,\" \"heathen,\" \"pagan\"--mean, alike, simply \"country  people,\" and point to some old-time superciliousness of the city-bred,  now confined, one hopes, to such localities as Whitechapel and the  Bowery.    There is, to the author's mind, a certain ruthless arrogance that grows  more offensive to him as the years pass by, in the temper that comes to  a \"new\" land and contemptuously ignores the native names of conspicuous  natural objects, almost always appropriate and significant, and overlays  them with names that are, commonly, neither the one nor the other. The  learned societies of the world, the geographical societies, the  ethnological societies, have set their faces against this practice these  many years past, and to them the writer confidently appeals.           *       *       *       *       *    This preface must bear a grateful acknowledgment to the most  distinguished of Alaskans--the man who knows more of Alaska than any  other human being--Peter Trimble Rowe, seventeen years bishop of that  immense territory, for the \"cordial assent\" which he gave to the  proposed expedition and the leave of absence which rendered it  possible--one more in a long list of kindnesses which have rendered  happy an association of nearly ten years. Nor can better place be found  for a tribute of gratitude to those who were of the little party: to Mr.  Harry P. Karstens, strong, competent, and resourceful, the real leader  of the expedition in the face of difficulty and danger; to Mr. Robert G.  Tatum, who took his share, and more than his share, of all toil and  hardship and was a most valuable colleague; to Walter Harper,  Indian-bred until his sixteenth year, and up to that time trained in not  much else than Henry of Navarre's training, \"to shoot straight, to speak  the truth; to do with little food and less sleep\" (though equal to an  abundance of both on occasion), who joyed in the heights as a  mountain-sheep or a chamois, and whose sturdy limbs and broad shoulders  were never weary or unwilling--to all of these there is heartfelt  affection and deep obligation. Nor must Johnny be forgotten, the Indian  boy who faithfully kept the base camp during a long vigil, and killed  game to feed the dogs, and denied himself, unasked, that others might  have pleasure, as the story will tell. And the name of Esaias, the  Indian boy who accompanied us to the base camp, and then returned with  the superfluous dogs, must be mentioned, with commendation for fidelity  and thanks for service. Acknowledgment is also made to many friends and  colleagues at the mission stations in the interior, who knew of the  purpose and furthered it greatly and held their tongues so that no  premature screaming bruit of it got into the Alaskan newspapers: to the  Rev. C. E. Betticher, Jr., particularly and most warmly.    The author would add, perhaps quite unnecessarily, yet lest any should  mistake, a final personal note. He is no professed explorer or climber  or \"scientist,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#1)"],[1,"Psmith, Journalist    by Pelham Grenville Wodehouse          PREFACE      THE conditions of life in New York are so different from those of  London that a story of this kind calls for a little explanation.  There are several million inhabitants of New York. Not all of them  eke out a precarious livelihood by murdering one another, but there  is a definite section of the population which murders--not  casually, on the spur of the moment, but on definitely commercial  lines at so many dollars per murder. The \"gangs\" of New York exist  in fact. I have not invented them. Most of the incidents in this  story are based on actual happenings. The Rosenthal case, where  four men, headed by a genial individual calling himself \"Gyp the  Blood\" shot a fellow-citizen in cold blood in a spot as public and  fashionable as Piccadilly Circus and escaped in a motor-car, made  such a stir a few years ago that the noise of it was heard all over  the world and not, as is generally the case with the doings of the  gangs, in New York only. Rosenthal cases on a smaller and less  sensational scale are frequent occurrences on Manhattan Island. It  was the prominence of the victim rather than the unusual nature of  the occurrence that excited the New York press. Most gang victims  get a quarter of a column in small type.    P. G. WODEHOUSE  New York, 1915          CHAPTER I    \"COSY MOMENTS\"    The man in the street would not have known it, but a great crisis  was imminent in New York journalism.    Everything seemed much as usual in the city. The cars ran blithely  on Broadway. Newsboys shouted \"Wux-try!\" into the ears of nervous  pedestrians with their usual Caruso-like vim. Society passed up and  down Fifth Avenue in its automobiles, and was there a furrow of  anxiety upon Society's brow? None. At a thousand street corners a  thousand policemen preserved their air of massive superiority to  the things of this world. Not one of them showed the least sign of  perturbation. Nevertheless, the crisis was at hand. Mr. J. Fillken  Wilberfloss, editor-in-chief of _Cosy Moments_, was about to leave  his post and start on a ten weeks' holiday.    In New York one may find every class of paper which the imagination  can conceive. Every grade of society is catered for. If an Esquimau  came to New York, the first thing he would find on the bookstalls  in all probability would be the _Blubber Magazine_, or some similar  production written by Esquimaux for Esquimaux. Everybody reads in  New York, and reads all the time. The New Yorker peruses his  favourite paper while he is being jammed into a crowded compartment  on the subway or leaping like an antelope into a moving Street car.    There was thus a public for _Cosy Moments_. _Cosy Moments_, as its  name (an inspiration of Mr. Wilberfloss's own) is designed to  imply, is a journal for the home. It is the sort of paper which the  father of the family is expected to take home with him from his  office and read aloud to the chicks before bed-time. It was founded  by its proprietor, Mr. Benjamin White, as an antidote to yellow  journalism. One is forced to admit that up to the present yellow  journalism seems to be competing against it with a certain measure  of success. Headlines are still of as generous a size as  heretofore, and there is no tendency on the part of editors to  scamp the details of the last murder-case.    Nevertheless, _Cosy Moments_ thrives. It has its public.    Its contents are mildly interesting, if you like that sort of  thing. There is a \"Moments in the Nursery\" page, conducted by  Luella Granville Waterman, to which parents are invited to  contribute the bright speeches of their offspring, and which  bristles with little stories about the nursery canary, by Jane  (aged six), and other works of rising young authors. There is a  \"Moments of Meditation\" page, conducted by the Reverend Edwin T.  Philpotts; a \"Moments Among the Masters\" page, consisting of  assorted chunks looted from the literature of the past, when  foreheads were bulgy and thoughts profound, by Mr. Wilberfloss  himself; one or two other pages; a short story; answers to  correspondents on domestic matters; and a \"Moments of Mirth\" page,  conducted by an alleged humorist of the name of B. Henderson Asher,  which is about the most painful production ever served up to a  confiding public.    The guiding spirit of _Cosy Moments_ was Mr. Wilberfloss.  Circumstances had left the development of the paper mainly to him.  For the past twelve months the proprietor had been away in Europe,  taking the waters at Carlsbad, and the sole control of _Cosy Moments_  had passed into the hands of Mr. Wilberfloss. Nor had he proved  unworthy of the trust or unequal to the duties. In that year _Cosy  Moments_ had reached the highest possible level of domesticity.  Anything not calculated to appeal to the home had been rigidly  excluded. And as a result the circulation had increased steadily.  Two extra pages had been added, \"Moments Among the Shoppers\" and  \"Moments with Society.\" And the advertisements had grown in volume.  But the work had told upon the Editor. Work of that sort carries  its penalties with it. Success means absorption, and absorption  spells softening of the brain.    Whether it was the strain of digging into the literature of the  past every week, or the effort of reading B. Henderson Asher's  \"Moments of Mirth\" is uncertain. At any rate, his duties, combined  with the heat of a New York summer, had sapped Mr. Wilberfloss's  health to such an extent that the doctor had ordered him ten weeks'  complete rest in the mountains. This Mr. Wilberfloss could,  perhaps, have endured, if this had been all. There are worse places  than the mountains of America in which to spend ten weeks of the  tail-end of summer, when the sun has ceased to grill and the  mosquitoes have relaxed their exertions. But it was not all. The  doctor, a far-seeing man who went down to first causes, had  absolutely declined to consent to Mr. Wilberfloss's suggestion that  he should keep in touch with the paper during his vacation. He was  adamant. He had seen copies of _Cosy Moments_ once or twice, and he  refused to permit a man in the editor's state of health to come in  contact with Luella Granville Waterman's \"Moments in the Nursery\"  and B. Henderson Asher's \"Moments of Mirth.\" The medicine-man put  his foot down firmly.    \"You must not see so much as the cover of the paper for ten weeks,\"  he said. \"And I'm not so sure that it shouldn't be longer. You must  forget that such a paper exists. You must dismiss the whole thing  from your mind, live in the open, and develop a little flesh and  muscle.\"    To Mr. Wilberfloss the sentence was almost equivalent to penal  servitude. It was with tears in his voice that he was giving his  final instructions to his sub-editor, in whose charge the paper  would be left during his absence. He had taken a long time doing  this. For two days he had been fussing in and out of the office, to  the discontent of its inmates, more especially Billy Windsor, the  sub-editor, who was now listening moodily to the last harangue of  the series, with the air of one whose heart is not in the subject.  Billy Windsor was a tall, wiry, loose-jointed young man, with  unkempt hair and the general demeanour of a caged eagle. Looking  at him, one could picture him astride of a bronco, rounding up  cattle, or cooking his dinner at a camp-fire. Somehow he did not  seem to fit into the _Cosy Moments_ atmosphere.    \"Well, I think that that is all, Mr. Windsor,\" chirruped the  editor. He was a little man with a long neck and large _pince-nez_,  and he always chirruped. \"You understand the general lines on which  I think the paper should be conducted?\" The sub-editor nodded. Mr.  Wilberfloss made him tired. Sometimes he made him more tired than  at other times. At the present moment he filled him with an aching  weariness. The editor meant well, and was full of zeal, but he had  a habit of covering and recovering the ground. He possessed the art  of saying the same obvious thing in a number of different ways to a  degree which is found usually only in politicians. If Mr. Wilberfloss  had been a politician, he would have been one of those dealers in  glittering generalities who used to be fashionable in American  politics.    \"There is just one thing,\" he continued \"Mrs. Julia Burdett Parslow  is a little inclined--I may have mentioned this before--\"    \"You did,\" said the sub-editor.    Mr. Wilberfloss chirruped on, unchecked.    \"A little inclined to be late with her 'Moments with Budding  Girlhood'. If this should happen while I am away, just write her a  letter, quite a pleasant letter, you understand, pointing out the  necessity of being in good time. The machinery of a weekly paper, of  course, cannot run smoothly unless contributors are in good time  with their copy. She is a very sensible woman, and she will  understand, I am sure, if you point it out to her.\"    The sub-editor nodded.    \"And there is just one other thing. I wish you would correct a  slight tendency I have noticed lately in Mr. Asher to be just a  trifle--well, not precisely _risky_, but perhaps a shade _broad_  in his humour.\"    \"His what?\" said Billy Windsor.    \"Mr. Asher is a very sensible man, and he will be the first to  acknowledge that his sense of humour has led him just a little  beyond the bounds. You understand? Well, that is all, I think. Now  I must really be going, or I shall miss my train. Good-bye, Mr.  Windsor.\"    \"Good-bye,\" said the sub-editor thankfully.    At the door Mr. Wilberfloss paused with the air of an exile bidding  farewell to his native land, sighed, and trotted out.    Billy Windsor put his feet upon the table, and with a deep scowl  resumed his task of reading the proofs of Luella Granville  Waterman's \"Moments in the Nursery.\"        CHAPTER II    BILLY WINDSOR    Billy Windsor had started life twenty-five years before"]]]
