APPLETON AND COMPANY 1901                         COPYRIGHT, 1901,           BY D. APPLETON AND COMPANY.          PREFACE      By the introduction of a complete series of star maps, drawn specially  for the use of the amateur and distributed through the body of the work,  thus facilitating consultation, it is believed that this book makes a  step in advance of its predecessors. The maps show all of the stars  visible to the naked eye in the regions of sky represented, and, in  addition, some stars that can only be seen with optical aid. The latter  have been placed in the maps as guide posts in the telescopic field to  assist those who are searching for faint and inconspicuous objects  referred to in the text. As the book was not written for those who  possess the equipment of an observatory, with telescopes driven by  clockwork and provided with graduated circles, right ascensions and  declinations are not given. All of the telescopic phenomena described  are, however, represented in the maps. Star clusters are indicated by a  conventional symbol, and nebulae by a little white circle; while a small  cross serves to mark the places where notable new stars have appeared.  The relative magnitudes of the stars are approximately shown by the  dimensions of their symbols in the maps, the smaller stars being  represented by white dots and the larger by star-shaped figures.    In regard to binary stars, it should be remembered that, in many cases,  their distances and angles of position change so rapidly that any  statement concerning them remains valid only for a few years at the  most. There is also much confusion among the measurements announced by  different authorities. In general, the most recent measurements  obtainable in 1900 are given in the text, but the observer who wishes to  study close and rapid binaries will do well to revise his information  about them as frequently as possible. An excellent list of double stars  kept up to date, will be found in the annual Companion to the  Observatory, published in London.    In the lunar charts the plan of inserting the names of the principal  formations has been preferred to that usually followed, of indicating  them only by numbers, accompanied by a key list. Even in the most  detailed charts of the moon only a part of what is visible with  telescopes can be shown, and the representation, at best, must be merely  approximate. It is simply a question of what to include and what to  omit; and in the present case the probable needs of the amateur observer  have governed the selection--readiness and convenience of reference  being the chief aim.    It should, perhaps, be said here that the various chapters composing  this book--like those of \"Astronomy with an Opera-glass\"--were, in their  original form, with the single exception of Chapter IX, published in  Appletons' Popular Science Monthly. The author, it is needless to say,  was much gratified by the expressed wish of many readers that these  scattered papers should be revised and collected in a more permanent  form. As bearing upon the general subject of the book, a chapter has  been added, at the end, treating on the question of the existence of  planets among the stars. This also first appeared in the periodical  above mentioned.    In conclusion, the author wishes for his readers as great a pleasure in  the use of the telescope as he himself has enjoyed.    G. P.

PLEASURES OF THE TELESCOPE    CHAPTER I    THE SELECTION AND TESTING OF A GLASS        \"O telescope, instrument of much knowledge, more precious than any      scepter! Is not he who holds thee in his hand made king and lord of      the works of God?\"--JOHN KEPLER.      If the pure and elevated pleasure to be derived from the possession and  use of a good telescope of three, four, five, or six inches aperture  were generally known, I am certain that no instrument of science would  be more commonly found in the homes of intelligent people. The writer,  when a boy, discovered unexpected powers in a pocket telescope not more  than fourteen inches long when extended, and magnifying ten or twelve  times. It became his dream, which was afterward realized, to possess a  more powerful telescope, a real astronomical glass, with which he could  see the beauties of the double stars, the craters of the moon, the spots  on the sun, the belts and satellites of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn,  the extraordinary shapes of the nebulae, the crowds of stars in the Milky  Way, and the great stellar clusters. And now he would do what he can to  persuade others, who perhaps are not aware how near at hand it lies, to  look for themselves into the wonder-world of the astronomers.    There is only one way in which you can be sure of getting a good  telescope. First, decide how large a glass you are to have, then go to a  maker of established reputation, fix upon the price you are willing to  pay--remembering that good work is never cheap--and finally see that the  instrument furnished to you answers the proper tests for a telescope of  its size. There are telescopes and telescopes. Occasionally a rare  combination of perfect homogeneity in the material, complete harmony  between the two kinds of glass of which the objective is composed, and  lens surfaces whose curves are absolutely right, produces a telescope  whose owner would part with his last dollar sooner than with it. Such  treasures of the lens-maker's art can not, perhaps, be commanded at  will, yet, they are turned out with increasing frequency, and the best  artists are generally able, at all times, to approximate so closely to  perfection that any shortcoming may be disregarded.    In what is said above I refer, of course, to the refracting telescope,  which is the form of instrument that I should recommend to all amateurs  in preference to the reflector. But, before proceeding further, it may  be well to recall briefly the principal points of difference between  these two kinds of telescopes. The purpose of a telescope of either  description is, first, to form an image of the object looked at by  concentrating at a focus the rays of light proceeding from that object.  The refractor achieves this by means of a carefully shaped lens, called  the object glass, or objective. The reflector, on the"]]]
