R. M. Algie, Chairman)      _Laid on the Table of the House of Representatives_      BY AUTHORITY:  R. E. OWEN, GOVERNMENT PRINTER, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND.--1955          REPORT      By a resolution of the House dated the 28th day of September 1954 a  Special Select Committee was appointed to consider and to report upon  certain matters relating to moral delinquency. In particular, the  Committee was instructed to study the recommendations contained in the  report of the Mazengarb Committee and to make such observations thereon  as it thought fit. This Special Select Committee was empowered to sit  during recess and was directed to report its findings to the House  within twenty-eight days after the commencement of the next ensuing  session of Parliament.    The Orders of Reference relating to the Committee were as follows:        ORDERS OF REFERENCE        _Extracts from the Journals of the House of Representatives_        TUESDAY, THE 28TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER 1954        _Ordered_, \"That a Select Committee be appointed, consisting of ten      Members, to consider the Report of the Special Committee on Moral      Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (H-47, 1954); the Committee      to make such recommendations or observations as it thinks fit to      the House or the Government; the Committee to have power to sit      during the recess and for twenty-eight days after the commencement      of the next ensuing session; the Committee to consist of six      Members to be nominated by the Prime Minister and four Members to      be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, such names to be      submitted to the Clerk of the House on or before 31 December 1954.      (Right Hon. Mr HOLLAND.)\"        The names submitted in accordance with the above Order of Reference      were: Mr Aderman, the Hon. Mr Algie, Mr Barnes, the Hon. Mr Hanan,      Mrs McMillan, the Hon. Mr Mason, Mr D. M. Rae, the Hon. Mrs Ross,      Mr Skoglund, and the Hon. Mr Tirikatene.          WEDNESDAY, THE 20TH DAY OF APRIL 1955        _Ordered_, \"That the period set down by Order of the House dated 28      September 1954 within which the Juvenile Delinquency Committee was      required to present its report be extended to 1 September 1955.\"      (Hon. Mr ALGIE.)          WEDNESDAY, THE 31ST DAY OF AUGUST 1955        _Ordered_, \"That the period set down by Order of the House dated 20      April 1955 within which the Juvenile Delinquency Committee was      required to present its report be extended to 1 October 1955.\"      (Hon. Mr ALGIE.)    The Committee met on two days during the recess and on a number of  occasions during the 1955 session.    For many reasons which need not be set out in this report, but which  were communicated to Parliament, it was found impossible to present a  report within the limits of time allowed, and by resolution of the  House it was finally agreed that the report should be presented on or  before the 1st day of October 1955.    We have given careful attention to each and every one of the  recommendations of the Mazengarb Committee. We have not felt it to be  our duty to hear over again all or any of the evidence placed before  that Committee, nor have we regarded it as our duty to deal broadly  with the incidence and causes of moral delinquency, or with the  discovery and presentation of remedies for this social malady. On the  contrary, we felt that we were required:        (1) To study the legislation relating to this subject and enacted      by Parliament in 1954, to consider its efficacy, and, if possible,      to make recommendations for its improvement, and        (2) To consider the suggestions made by the Mazengarb Committee for      action by particular Government Departments, to give an opinion as      to how far such recommendations could be given practical effect,      and to set out for the information of Parliament the extent to      which those recommendations had been put into operation.    Our views, suggestions, and recommendations are as follows:      The Need for Continuous Expert Investigation    In the course of our study of this problem it was frequently pointed  out to us that there was a real need for a thorough and continuous  study of this problem by those who from their training, experience, and  occupation were best qualified to advise as to the scope and extent of  the problem, as to its general causes, and as to the practical ways of  dealing with it. From information in the possession of the police and  of the Department of Justice it appeared that the extent of the evil  was in fact not so alarming as one might be induced to believe by a  perusal of the reports in the newspapers; there was, however, plenty of  evidence to suggest that misconduct amongst adolescents was increasing  and that this aspect of the matter was one for grave concern. There was  support for these views in written memoranda submitted by two of our  Magistrates, Mr Sinclair and Mr M. C. Astley. The Secretary for Justice  and Controller-General of Prisons, Mr S. T. Barnett, wrote as follows:        \"My suggestion is that, as a first step, the Ministers in charge of      social Departments, e.g., Education, Child Welfare, Justice,      Police, should be requested to direct their Permanent Heads to      concert together and get down to a group study of the problem and      report to Government on the practical measures to meet it.        \"Within these Departments are experts who can get down to the facts      and who ought to be able to propound some suggestions to ameliorate      the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. They should, of      course, be authorized, and indeed requested, to enlarge the      departmental group and to take in representatives of principal      welfare organizations.\"    The suggestions made by Mr Barnett were adopted, and the work  recommended by him is being carried on. The results have not yet  been made available to us.    We think that in matters of this kind fact finding carried out by  experts in a thoroughly scientific manner is fundamental, and in a  later portion of this report we have a specific recommendation to  make on this subject.      Specific Recommendations of Mazengarb Committee Relative  to Child Welfare Administration    In paragraph (4) of the report of the Mazengarb Committee--pages  57 to 60 inclusive--there are a number of comments and suggestions  relating to the Child Welfare Act and its administration. We have  examined these paragraphs very carefully, and we set out below some  excerpts from the report furnished to us by the Director of Education.  Our views are given immediately following the extract from the  opinion expressed by Dr Beeby, which is as follows:        \"We have always felt that the spirit of the Child Welfare Act 1925      placed an obligation on us to do preventive work, and there are two      Cabinet decisions, one going back to 1941, which certainly give the      authority. However, we agree that it might be desirable to have the      obligation expressed explicitly in the Act. Indeed, in the draft      Child Welfare Bill prepared by the Division some eighteen months      ago you will find this done in two ways:            \"(1) On page 43 of the draft Bill I sent you you will find Part          I devoted to preventive work, and clause 1 begins, 'It shall be          the _duty_ of the Superintendent to take positive action to          prevent children, etc.'.            \"(2) On page 1 the definition of 'Child in need of care and          protection' is so widened as to cover every possible type of          preventive case, if read in conjunction with the amendments          passed during last session and with the Cabinet authorities to          spend public funds on such children.        \"We do not think it necessary to increase the powers of Child      Welfare Officers for these purposes. To give them more actual      powers over children who have not committed an offence would be to      risk justifiable public objection to interference with the liberty      of the subject and the rights of parents.\"      _Page 58, paragraph (b)_    In its report the Mazengarb Committee said that the establishment  a few years ago of a Ministry of Social Welfare, and the urgent need  for more preventive work to be done, suggest the possibility of better  administration if \"child welfare\" were given an independent status  under the Ministry for Social Welfare.    This suggestion was examined by the Director of Education and by  the Superintendent of the Child Welfare Division of the Department  of Education. They reported fully to us, and their views are set out  below in summarized form.    The strongest arguments that were placed before us in support of  the view that child welfare should be a separate and independent  Department were to the following effect:        (1) The Superintendent would--as the head of his own Department--be      the captain of his own ship subject only to the direction of his      own Minister.        (2) The Director of Education has a huge Department of his own to      administer, and he cannot be expected to give to child welfare the      full measure of attention it should have.        (3) The Minister of Education must in the main find his principal      and absorbing interest in the school system, and he could hardly      devote to child welfare the same degree of attention that could be      expected from the Minister of Social Welfare.        (4) There would be times when the Superintendent must find it      burdensome to have to work through a Department with far-reaching      special interests of its own.

SALEM WITCHCRAFT                         AND                    COTTON MATHER.                         A REPLY.                              BY                   CHARLES W. UPHAM,   _Member of the Massachusetts Historical Society._                      MORRISANIA, N. Y.:                         1869.                           TO         HENRY B. DAWSON, ESQ.,         PROPRIETOR AND EDITOR                   OF       _THE HISTORICAL MAGAZINE_,      THIS REPRINT FROM ITS PAGES      IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY                          ITS AUTHOR.    SALEM, MASS., December 10, 1869.          Transcriber's Note:        Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note.      Superscript text is preceded by the ^ character. Variant spellings,      including the inconsistent spelling of proper nouns, remain as      printed. Spelling errors in quotations have been retained, despite      the generally poor quality of the original typesetting.          PREFATORY NOTE.      The Editors of the _North American Review_ would, under the  circumstances, I have no reason to doubt, have opened its columns to a  reply to the article that has led to the preparation of the following  statement. But its length has forbidden my asking such a favor.    All interested in the department of American literature to which the  HISTORICAL MAGAZINE belongs, must appreciate the ability with which it  is conducted, and the laborious and indefatigable zeal of its Editor, in  collecting and placing on its pages, beyond the reach of oblivion and  loss, the scattered and perishing materials necessary to the elucidation  of historical and biographical topics, whether relating to particular  localities or the country at large; and it was as gratifying as  unexpected to receive the proffer, without limitation, of the use of  that publication for this occasion.    The spirited discussion, by earnest scholars, of special questions,  although occasionally assuming the aspect of controversy, will be not  only tolerated but welcomed by liberal minds. Let champions arise, in  all sections of the Republic, to defend their respective rightful claims  to share in a common glorious inheritance and to inscribe their several  records in our Annals. Feeling the deepest interest in the Historical,  Antiquarian, and Genealogical Societies of Massachusetts, and yielding  to none in keen sensibility to all that concerns the ancient honors of  the Old Bay State and New England, generally, I rejoice to witness the  spirit of a commemorative age kindling the public mind, every where, in  the Middle, Western and Southern States.    The courtesy extended to me is evidence that while, by a jealous  scrutiny and, sometimes, perhaps, a sharp conflict, we are reciprocally  imposing checks upon loose exaggerations and overweening pretensions, a  comprehensive good feeling predominates over all; truth in its purity is  getting eliminated; and characters and occurrences, in all parts of the  country, brought under the clear light of justice.    The aid I have received, in the following discussion, from the  publications and depositories of historical associations and the  contributions of individuals, like Mr. Goodell, Doctor Moore, and  others, engaged in procuring from the mother country and preserving all  original tracts and documents, whenever found, belonging to our Colonial  period, demonstrate the importance of such efforts, whether of Societies  or single persons. In this way, our history will stand on a solid  foundation, and have the lineaments of complete and exact truth.    Notwithstanding the distance from the place of printing, owing to the  faithful and intelligent oversight of the superintendent of the press  and the vigilant core of the compositors, but few errors, I trust, will  be found, beyond what are merely literal, and every reader will  unconsciously, or readily, correct for himself.

An article in _The North American Review_, for April, 1869, is mostly  devoted to a notice of the work published by me, in 1867, entitled  _Salem Witchcraft, with an account of Salem Village, and a history of  opinions on witchcraft and kindred subjects_. If the article had  contained criticisms, in the usual style, merely affecting the character  of that work, in a literary point of view, no other duty would have  devolved upon me, than carefully to consider and respectfully heed its  suggestions. But it raises questions of an historical nature that seem  to demand a response, either acknowledging the correctness of its  statements or vindicating my own.    The character of the Periodical in which it appears; the manner in which  it was heralded by rumor, long before its publication; its circulation,  since, in a separate pamphlet form; and the extent to which, in certain  quarters, its assumptions have been endorsed, make a reply imperative.    The subject to which it relates is of acknowledged interest and  importance. The Witchcraft Delusion of 1692 has justly arrested a wider  notice, and probably always will, than any other occurrence in the early  colonial history of this country. It presents phenomena in the realm of  our spiritual nature, belonging to that higher department of physiology,  known as Psychology, of the greatest moment; and illustrates the  operations of the imagination upon the passions and faculties in  immediate connection with it, and the perils to which the soul and  society are thereby exposed, in a manner more striking, startling and  instructive than is elsewhere to be found. For all reasons, truth and  justice require of those who venture to explore and portray it, the  utmost efforts to elucidate its passages and delineate correctly its  actors.    With these"]]]
