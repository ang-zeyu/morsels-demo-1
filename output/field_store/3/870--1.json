Buckskin    The town lay sprawled over half a square mile of alkali plain, its main  Street depressing in its width, for those who were responsible for its  inception had worked with a generosity born of the knowledge that they  had at their immediate and unchallenged disposal the broad lands of  Texas and New Mexico on which to assemble a grand total of twenty  buildings, four of which were of wood. As this material was scarce, and  had to be brought from where the waters of the Gulf lapped against the  flat coast, the last-mentioned buildings were a matter of local pride,  as indicating the progressiveness of their owners.    These creations of hammer and saw were of one story, crude and  unpainted; their cheap weather sheathing, warped and shrunken by the  pitiless sun, curled back on itself and allowed unrestricted entrance to  alkali dust and air. The other shacks were of adobe, and reposed in that  magnificent squalor dear to their owners, Indians and Mexicans.    It was an incident of the Cattle Trail, that most unique and stupendous  of all modern migrations, and its founders must have been inspired with  a malicious desire to perpetrate a crime against geography, or else they  reveled in a perverse cussedness, for within a mile on every side lay  broad prairies, and two miles to the east flowed the indolent waters of  the Rio Pecos itself. The distance separating the town from the river  was excusable, for at certain seasons of the year the placid stream  swelled mightily and swept down in a broad expanse of turbulent, yellow  flood.    Buckskin was a town of one hundred inhabitants, located in the valley of  the Rio Pecos fifty miles south of the Texas-New Mexico line. The  census claimed two hundred, but it was a well-known fact that it was  exaggerated. One instance of this is shown by the name of Tom Flynn.  Those who once knew Tom Flynn, alias Johnny Redmond, alias Bill Sweeney,  alias Chuck Mullen, by all four names, could find them in the census  list. Furthermore, he had been shot and killed in the March of the  year preceding the census, and now occupied a grave in the young but  flourishing cemetery. Perry's Bend, twenty miles up the river, was  cognizant of this and other facts, and, laughing in open derision at  the padded list, claimed to be the better town in all ways, including  marksmanship.    One year before this tale opens, Buck Peters, an example for the more  recent Billy the Kid, had paid Perry's Bend a short but busy visit. He  had ridden in at the north end of Main Street and out at the south. As  he came in he was fired at by a group of ugly cowboys from a ranch known  as the C 80. He was hit twice, but he unlimbered his artillery, and  before his horse had carried him, half dead, out on the prairie, he had  killed one of the group. Several citizens had joined the cowboys  and added their bullets against Buck. The deceased had been the best  bartender in the country, and the rage of the suffering citizens can  well be imagined. They swore vengeance on Buck, his ranch, and his  stamping ground.    The difference between Buck and Billy the Kid is that the former never  shot a man who was not trying to shoot him, or who had not been warned  by some action against Buck that would call for it. He minded his own  business, never picked a quarrel, and was quiet and pacific up to  a certain point. After that had been passed he became like a raging  cyclone in a tenement house, and storm-cellars were much in demand.    \"Fanning\" is the name of a certain style of gun play not unknown among  the bad men of the West. While Buck was not a bad man, he had to rub  elbows with them frequently, and he believed that the sauce for the  goose was the sauce for the gander. So be bad removed the trigger of his  revolver and worked the hammer with the thumb of the \"gun hand\" or the  heel of the unencumbered hand. The speed thus acquired was greater than  that of the more modern double-action weapon. Six shots in a few seconds  was his average speed when that number was required, and when it is  thoroughly understood that at least some of them found their intended  bullets it is not difficult to realize that fanning was an operation of  danger when Buck was doing it.    He was a good rider, as all cowboys are, and was not afraid of anything  that lived. At one time he and his chums, Red Connors and Hopalong  Cassidy, had successfully routed a band of fifteen Apaches who wanted  their scalps. Of these, twelve never hunted scalps again, nor anything  else on this earth, and the other three returned to their tribe with  the report that three evil Spirits had chased them with \"wheel guns\"  (cannons).    So now, since his visit to Perry's Bend, the rivalry of the two towns  had turned to hatred and an alert and eager readiness to increase the  inhabitants of each other's graveyard. A state of war existed, which for  a time resulted in nothing worse than acrimonious suggestions. But the  time came when the score was settled to the satisfaction of one side, at  least.    Four ranches were also concerned in the trouble. Buckskin was surrounded  by two, the Bar 20 and the Three Triangle. Perry's Bend was the  common point for the C 80 and the Double Arrow. Each of the two ranch  contingents accepted the feud as a matter of course, and as a matter  of course took sides with their respective towns. As no better class of  fighters ever lived, the trouble assumed Homeric proportions and insured  a danger zone well worth watching.    Bar-20's northern line was C 80's southern one, and Skinny Thompson took  his turn at outriding one morning after the season's round-up. He was to  follow the boundary and turn back stray cattle. When he had covered the  greater part of his journey he saw Shorty Jones riding toward him on a  course parallel to his own and about long revolver range away. Shorty  and he had \"crossed trails\" the year before and the best of feelings did  not exist between them.    Shorty stopped and stared at Skinny, who did likewise at Shorty. Shorty  turned his mount around and applied the spurs, thereby causing his  indignant horse to raise both heels at Skinny. The latter took it all  in gravely and, as Shorty faced him again, placed his left thumb to his  nose, wiggling his fingers suggestively. Shorty took no apparent notice  of this but began to shout:    \"Yu wants to keep yore busted-down cows on yore own side. They was all  over us day afore yisterday. I'm goin' to salt any more what comes over,  and don't yu fergit it, neither.\"    Thompson wigwagged with his fingers again and shouted in reply: \"Yu c'n  salt all yu wants to, but if I ketch yu adoin' it yu won't have to work  no more. An' I kin say right here thet they's more C 80 cows over here  than they's Bar-20's over there.\"    Shorty reached for his revolver and yelled, \"Yore a liar!\"    Among the cowboys in particular and the Westerners in general at that  time, the three suicidal terms, unless one was an expert in drawing  quick and shooting straight with one movement, were the words \"liar,\"  \"coward,\" and \"thief.\" Any man who was called one of these in earnest,  and he was the judge, was expected to shoot if he could and save his  life, for the words were seldom used without a gun coming with them. The  movement of Shorty's hand toward his belt before the appellation reached  him was enough for Skinny, who let go at long range--and missed.      The two reports were as one. Both urged their horses nearer and fired  again. This time Skinny's sombrero gave a sharp jerk and a hole appeared  in the crown. The third shot of Skinny's sent the horse of the other to  its knees and then over on its side. Shorty very promptly crawled behind  it and, as he did so, Skinny began a wide circle, firing at intervals as  Shorty's smoke cleared away.    Shorty had the best position for defense, as he was in a shallow coule,  but he knew that he could not leave it until his opponent had either  grown tired of the affair or had used up his ammunition. Skinny knew it,  too. Skinny also knew that he could get back to the ranch house and lay  in a supply of food and ammunition and return before Shorty could cover  the twelve miles he had to go on foot.    Finally Thompson began to head for home. He had carried the matter as  far as he could without it being murder. Too much time had elapsed now,  and, besides, it was before breakfast and he was hungry. He would go  away and settle the score at some time when they would be on equal  terms.    He rode along the line for a mile and chanced to look back. Two C 80  punchers were riding after him, and as they saw him turn and discover  them they fired at him and yelled. He rode on for some distance and  cautiously drew his rifle out of its long holster at his right leg.  Suddenly he turned around in the saddle and fired twice. One of his  pursuers fell forward on the neck of his horse, and his comrade turned  to help him. Thompson wig-wagged again and rode on, reaching the ranch  as the others were finishing their breakfast.    At the table Red Connors remarked that the tardy one had a hole in his  sombrero, and asked its owner how and where he had received it.    \"Had a argument with C 80 out'n th' line.\"    \"Go 'way! Ventilate enny?\"    \"One.\"    \"Good boy, sonny! Hey, Hopalong, Skinny perforated C 80 this mawnin'!\"    Hopalong Cassidy was struggling with a mouthful of beef. He turned his  eyes toward Red without ceasing, and grinning as well as he could under  the circumstances managed to grunt out \"Gu--,\" which was as near to  \"Good\" as the beef would allow.    Lanky Smith now chimed in as he repeatedly stuck his knife into a  reluctant boiled potato, \"How'd yu do it, Skinny?\"    \"Bet he sneaked up on him,\" joshed Buck Peters; \"did yu ask his pardin,  Skinny?\"    \"Ask nuthin',\" remarked Red, \"he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net                Transcriber's Note    The Glossary and Index includes a pronunciation of the Anglo-Saxon  names in the text.

Men's conceptions of the heroic  change with changing years, and vary with each individual mind; hence  it often happens that one person sees in a legend only the central  heroism, while another sees only the inartistic details of mediaeval  life which tend to disguise and warp the heroic quality.    It may be that to some people the heroes I have chosen do not seem  heroic, but there is no doubt that to the age and generation which  wrote or sang of them they appeared real heroes, worthy of remembrance  and celebration, and it has been my object to come as close as  possible to the mediaeval mind, with its elementary conceptions of  honour, loyalty, devotion, and duty. I have therefore altered the  tales as little as I could, and have tried to put them as fairly as  possible before modern readers, bearing in mind the altered conditions  of things and of intellects to-day.    In the work of selecting and retelling these stories I have to  acknowledge with most hearty thanks the help and advice of Mr. F. E.  Bumby, B.A., of the University College, Nottingham, who has been  throughout a most kind and candid censor or critic. His help has been  in every way invaluable. I have also to acknowledge the generous  permission given me by Mr. W. B. Yeats to write in prose the story of  his beautiful play, \"The Countess Cathleen,\" and to adorn it with  quotations from that play.    The poetical quotations are attributed to the authors from whose  works they are taken wherever it is possible. When mediaeval passages  occur which are not thus attributed they are my own versions from the  original mediaeval poems.                                                        M. I.
