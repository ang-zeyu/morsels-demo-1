Hardwood leaves like oak and  chestnut contain more plant food than those from soft wooded  trees.--_Garden and Farm Almanac.

Most of us could manage to be fairly happy if we really       tried to make the best of things.           MONDAY.         _Don't get depressed even if things do seem to be going       wrong at the moment. Depression will make matters worse       rather than better. If you do your duty faithfully, the sun       is sure to shine again sometime._           TUESDAY.         Many people pride themselves on their plain speaking. An       ability to put things pleasantly is really far more       valuable. Even fault-finding can be pleasantly done.           WEDNESDAY.         _It always seems to me that God is probably less anxious       that we should fulfil our tasks in life than that we should       do our best._           THURSDAY.         Of the people who complain most bitterly that they have \"no       chance\" probably a very small proportion would do great       things if great opportunities came. \"No chance\" is a very       old excuse.           FRIDAY.         _Don't give way to selfishness--that detestable vice that we       all find it so difficult to forgive in others._           SATURDAY.         Even if you don't like your work, try to do it well. It may       lead on to your true vocation.      For the Automobile Visitor    It is the frequent experience of the housewife living in the country or  suburbs these days to receive unexpected visits from friends who are  touring in automobiles, and she finds she must have something  attractive, dainty and nourishing ready at a moment's notice to  supplement the cup of tea or coffee so welcome after a hot, dusty trip.  It is a wise plan to keep a variety of Summer Sausage on hand, as in a  very few minutes delicious sandwiches may be prepared with this, these  sandwiches having the charm of novelty. It is impossible to deal in a  short article with the many varieties of Summer Sausage, but there are  three or four which can be touched upon. To have a thorough  understanding of their goodness one must not only read about them but  taste them. They are the staple diet in many foreign countries and in  the Armour brand the native flavoring has been done with remarkable  faithfulness--so much so that large quantities are shipped from this  country every week to the countries where they originated.    CERVELAT: This sausage is made of finest pork chopped fine, smoked and  air dried. It is highly spiced. A very delicious way to serve this is to  cut thin slices of white bread in rounds just the size of the sausage.  Put the meat, cut very thin, between the slices of bread and toast for a  minute with a very hot fire. This keeps the exposed sides absolutely dry  and the sandwich can be eaten without a fork.    GERMAN SALAMI: This sausage will be much appreciated by people who like  the smoky flavor of ham and bacon. In it the meat is chopped a little  coarser than in the Cervelat, and the spicing is the same as that used  in Germany. Serve cut very thin, with rye or bran bread.    LACKSCHINKEN: This is a very delicately flavored German titbit. It is  made of boneless pork loins cured in mild sweet pickle before smoking.  It makes delicious sandwiches with white or brown bread sliced thin and  lightly buttered.    MORTADELLA, a favorite Italian sausage, is made from lean pork ham meat  chopped very fine. The flavoring is delicious, the careful blending of  spices giving a distinctly foreign touch.    In many restaurants throughout the country they serve, as in foreign  countries, a slice or two of Summer Sausage as an appetizer before  beginning the meal. This custom is rapidly spreading into the home, and  Summer Sausage now has an established place in the daily bill of fare.

Through instructors who go about the country,  the farmers are taught how to get a bigger yield from the same area of  soil. The work of these wonderful teachers is supplemented by women  domestic science teachers who in the same manner visit the homes in  their districts and instruct the good _Haus Frau_ on how to improve,  economize, and systematize in kitchen and household work.    The manner in which these women instruct is, I am sure, of especial  interest to the Cook Book readers, inasmuch as the method is in a way  practically the same as what the Cook Book is doing. Where they teach by  hand and mouth the Cook Book has taught through its exchange of ideas,  contest stories, and recipe contests, the object being the same in both  cases that of instruction, education and economy in the kitchen and  saving of steps in the housework.    It is truly said of Germans that they are the most frugal and economical  of all people. In the past the usual method has been to exert this  frugality with what is already on hand in the larder left-overs, so to  speak. One point of the modern instruction of these wandering domestic  science teachers, as they go from home to home, is to show the economy  of systematic buying of groceries, meats and vegetables. Where the  practice in the past has been to buy a little, so there is not much  expenditure of money, German housewives are now taught the economy of  buying in bulk, because it is cheaper, and there is never any waste of  food in a German home, no matter how much of it there may be on hand.    Neither is there any good reason why there should be any waste of food  in an American home. Economy or frugality comes from knowing how, and  not from any stingy purpose, as some ill-advised people think.    The methods of these teachers show that this wonderful nation is alive  to the fact that the high cost of living is in our own waste and  carelessness, that oftentimes we do not make the most of what we have or  what we are given to do with.

PRACTICAL TAXIDERMY    PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.    THE First Edition of \"Practical Taxidermy\" having now run through the  press--with, I venture to hope, some profit to students of the art, if  I may judge from the many hundreds Of letters I have from time to time  received--the publishers have invited me to revise such parts of the  work as may be expedient, and also to add many technical methods of  modelling animals an artistic manner.    I do this the more readily because of the narrow way in which most  professional Taxidermists bolster up their art in a secret and  entirely unnecessary manner--unnecessary because amateur can, but by  the severest application, possibly compete with the experience of the  technical or professional worker. No pictorial artist ever pretends he  has a special brush or colours with which he can paint landscapes or  sea pieces at will; he knows that only thorough mastery of the  technicalities of his art--supplemented by wide experience and close  application--enables him to succeed as he does, and to delight people  who, seeing his facility of handling, may imagine that picture  painting is very easy and could be readily acquired--perhaps from  books. So it is with the Taxidermist. Those, therefore, who procure  this book, thinking to do all attempted to be explained therein  without long study and without a knowledge of anatomy, form,  arrangement, and colour, may put it on one side as useless. These  pages are merely an introduction to a delightful art, which must be  wooed with patient determination and loving pains until technical  skill invests it with beauty.    If I can be of any assistance to my readers, I invite them to write to  me if at any time they are puzzled or temporarily disheartened; merely  asking them to remember:    (1)--That, not being in business, I cannot of course answer purely  business communications; and (2)--Not being a man of infinite leisure,  it must also be remembered that a properly directed envelope for  return to the inquirer is of consequence when minutes are precious.  Unlike the Prime Minister, I do not like post-cards, and never answer  them if from unknown correspondents.    I may here mention that this edition is not only considerably  enlarged, but has several woodcuts and four plates added, three of  which latter have been engraved from photographs specially taken for  this work.    I say now, in conclusion, work hard, study hard, and look to good  modellers and painters--and not to bird-stuffers--for conceptions of  form, arrangement, and colour, and in the end, believe me, you will  achieve a better success than attends the labours of those who follow  in the old paths of careless or inartistic Taxidermy.    MONTAGU BROWNE.    LEICESTER.    PRACTICAL TAXIDERMY.    CHAPTER I.    THE RISE AND PROGRESS of TAXIDERMY.    TAXIDERMY, which is derived from two Greek words, a literal  translation of which would signify the \"arrangement of skins,\" appears  to have been practised in a limited degree ages ago, for may we not  say without doubt that the first taxidermists were the ancient  Egyptians, who, despite the fact that they seldom or never appear to  have removed the skin as a whole, as in our modern methods, yet,  taking into consideration the excellent manner in which they preserved  their human or other bodies for thousands of years by the aid of  injections, spices, essential oils, or what not, they may, I think, be  fairly placed in the front rank as the first taxidermists the world  has known. For an account, of the arts used in embalming see  Herodotus, who says:    In Egypt certain persons are appointed by law to exercise this art  (embalming) as their peculiar business; and when a dead body is  brought them they produce patterns of mummies in wood imitated in  painting, the most elaborate of which are said to be of him (Osiris)  whose name I do not think it right to mention on this occasion. The  second which they show is simpler and less costly; the third is the  cheapest. Having exhibited them all, they inquire of the persons who  have applied to them which method they wish to be adopted, and this  being settled, and the price agreed upon, the parties return, leaving  the body with the embalmers.    In preparing it according to the first method, they commence by  extracting the brain from the nostrils with a curved iron probe,  partly clearing the head by this means, and partly by pouring in  certain drugs; then, making an incision in the side with a sharp  Ethiopian stone, they draw out the intestines through the aperture.  Having cleansed and washed them with palm wine they cover them with  pounded aromatics, and afterwards filling the cavity with powder of  pure, myrrh, cassia, and other fragrant substances, frankincense  excepted, they sew it up again. This being done, they salt the body,  keeping it in natron seventy days, to which period they are strictly  confined. When the seventy days are over they wash the body and wrap  it up entirely in bands of fine linen smeared on their inner side with  gum, which the Egyptians generally use instead of glue. The relatives  then take away the body, and have a wooden ease made in the form of a  man, in which they deposit it, and, when fastened up, they keep it in  a room in their house, placing it upright against the wall. This is  the most costly method of embalming.    For those who choose the middle-kind, on account of the expense, they  prepare the body as follows: They fill syringes with oil of cedar, and  inject this into the abdomen, without making any incision or removing  the bowels, and, taking care that the liquid shall not escape, they  keep it in salt during the specified number of days. The cedar oil is  then taken out, and such is its strength, that it brings with it the  bowels and all the inside in a state of dissolution. The natron also  dissolves the flesh, so that nothing remains but the skin and bones.  This process being over, they restore the body without any further  operation.    The third kind of embalming is only adopted for the poor. In this they  merely cleanse the body, by an injection of syrmoea, and salt it  during seventy days, after which it is returned to the friends who  brought it.    The account given by Diodorus is similar, if we except the cost and  time of embalming. The most expensive way of embalming costs a talent  of silver (about 250 pounds sterling); the second, twenty-two minae  (60 pounds); and the third is extremely cheap. The persons who embalm  the bodies are artists who have learnt this secret from their  ancestors. They present to the friends of the deceased who apply to  them an estimate of the funeral expenses, and ask them in what manner  they wish it to be performed, which being agreed upon, they deliver  the body to the proper persona appointed to that office. First, one  who is denominated the scribe, marks upon the left side of the body,  as it lies on the ground, the extent of the incision which is to be  made; then another, who is called the dissector, cuts open as much of  the flesh as the law permits with a sharp Ethiopian stone, and  immediately runs away, pursued by those who are present throwing  stones at him, amidst bitter execrations, as if to cast upon him all  the odium of this necessary act, for they look upon everyone who has  offered violence to, or inflicted b wound or any other injury upon a  human body to be hateful; but the embalmers, on the contrary, are held  in the greatest consideration and respect, being the associates of the  priests, and permitted free access to e temples as sacred persons.    As soon as they have met together to embalm the body thus prepared  them, one introduces his band through the aperture into the abdomen,  and takes everything out except the kidneys and heart, another  cleanses each of the viscera with palm wine and aromatic substances;  lastly, having applied oil of cedar and other things to the whole body  for wards of thirty days, they add myrrh, cinnamon, and those drugs  which have not only the power of preserving the body for a length of  time, but of imparting to it a fragrant odour. It is then restored to  the friends of the deceased; and so perfectly are all the members  preserved even the hair of the eyelids and eyebrows remains  undisturbed, and the whole appearance of the person is so unaltered  that every feature may be recognised.    Sir J. Gardener Wilkinson (\"Manners and Customs of the Ancient  Egyptians\") from whom I have quoted, says that:    \"The extraction of the brain by the nostrils is proved by the  appearance of the mummies found in the tombs; and some of the crooked  instruments (always of bronze) supposed to have been used for this  purpose have been discovered at Thebes.\"  The preservatives appear to  have been of two classes, bituminous and saline, consisting, in the  first class, of gums, resins, asphaltum, and pure bitumen, with,  doubtless, some astringent barks powders, etc. rubbed in. Mummies  prepared in this is way are known by their dry, yet flexible skins,  retracted and adherent to the bones; features, "]]]
