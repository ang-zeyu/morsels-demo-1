Scientific and Religious Journal.    VOL. I. AUGUST, 1880. NO. 8.          THE IMPORTANCE AND NATURE OF REFORMATION FROM SIN.      This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come; for men  shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,  disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection,  truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those  who are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than  lovers of God; having a form of godliness but denying the power  thereof.--2 Tim. 3: 1-5.    The Savior once began his instructions with these words, \"This day is  this Scripture fulfilled.\" They seem to be an appropriate introduction  to our lesson upon this occasion. What is the religion of thousands?  They were made the special objects of God's favor in their infancy (?),  were christened in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the  Holy Spirit (?), were dedicated to God and his service by their parents  (?), who, for them, took a solemn vow to forsake the devil and all his  works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous desires,  to forsake, also, all the carnal desires of the flesh, and not to follow  or be led by them. It is said that the christened took this vow when  they were children, and understood it not; when they became men they  understood it about as well as when they were children. But in all  candor, I confess that I never could believe they took this vow; their  sponsors took it upon themselves to make it for them, and usually  pledged themselves to see it fulfilled. What fearful responsibilities  are assumed just here. It is too frequently the case that those very  sponsors serve more devoutly, love more affectionately, and confide more  heartily in the profits, honors and pleasures of the world than in the  Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.    Survey the lives of many of these men, of all conditions, and then deny,  if you can, that the profits, honors and pleasures of the world are the  gods they worship. Their daily and constant employment is either a  violent pursuit of the vain pomp and glory of the world, or of its  power, riches and profits; or it may be that they are led on by pride,  malice or revenge. Such persons live, not knowing or regarding the fact  that the baptism which now saves us is \"not the putting away of the  filth of the flesh, _but the answer of a good conscience_ toward God.\"  There are many such who live but little in advance of pagans in a  commonwealth of Christians, and know but little more of God or of Christ  than if they had been brought up in India. A great many are taught to  act over this play in the name of religion, and learned to say, \"Our  Father who art in heaven,\" and \"I believe in God the Father Almighty;\"  but do they live as though they did believe in earnest that God is their  Almighty Father? Do they fear him and trust in him? Do they love and  obey him? Mere pretense, or, as Paul termed it, a _guise_ of godliness,  for such is the meaning of the original term, is so common that we meet  with it almost daily. Men have learned to tamper with the word of God  until the world is full of theorists. How many talk about religion who  set aside a great portion of the word of God as worse than useless? And  that which they profess to believe they do not believe with half the  simplicity which they manifest in believing the words of their earthly  parents. It has been said, \"He who is not industrious to obtain what he  professes to desire does not desire it, and he who is not industrious to  bring about that for which he prays, prays with his tongue _only_, and  not with his heart.\" All such have simply a \"guise\" of godliness, while  they deny its power.    A great many people profess to believe the Scriptures are true, and that  they present the plain and only way to infinite and eternal blessedness,  and yet they neglect the study of the Scriptures. How is this? If there  was a book revealing a plain and easy way for all men to become rich and  enjoy health and pleasure and this world's happiness, would it not be  studied by all men? And why is it that the Bible is not studied by the  masses and regarded more? Why are so many professors of religion  negligent in this matter? May it not be because they prefer all other  business and pleasures before this? If professors of religion throughout  christendom heartily believed the Scriptures even as they profess, they  would be more diligently studied, and in many instances treated with  greater respect. The faith of many is undoubtedly very weak. If the laws  of our country provided a plain way of escape from temporal death for  the benefit of the condemned criminal, as plain and pointed as the great  commission given to the apostles of Christ, would any condemned criminal  hesitate to obey or treat the stipulations of law as men are constantly  treating the precepts of the gospel of Christ? When a man believes the  Bible contains _the facts and truths_ which concern us infinitely more  than all earthly matters, his care and diligence should be, _to some  extent_, in harmony with his persuasion. At this point men _seem to be_  most strangely careless and grossly negligent. How few people do, or  will, understand that the terms of salvation are written as with the  beams of the sun? Is the trouble a low degree of faith, approximating  unbelief? The shadows are always the longest when the sun is lowest. Is  the sun of righteousness low in your spiritual heavens? Or have you  given him the uppermost seat in your affections? What think you of  Christ? Whose son is he?    When I tell you that thousands received the baptism of repentance for  the remission of sins, even before the Holy Spirit was given, and were  clean through the words spoken unto them, many are ready to cry out,  \"These are hard and strange sayings--who can hear them?\" Yet, strange as  it may seem, these facts have been upon record near _nineteen hundred_  years. Jesus said, \"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to  every creature; he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he  that believeth not shall be damned.\" In the record of St. Luke, chapter  24, the condition of the new covenant, to which remission of sins is  promised, is expressed by the term _repentance_: \"Thus it behooved  Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and that repentance and  remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,  beginning at Jerusalem.\" The word repentance, when used in the law of  Christ, is always equivalent to the use which the ancient martyrs made  of it, viz: \"Amend your lives.\" We have it beautifully expressed in  these words: \"If the wicked turn from all the sins which he hath  committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and  right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.\"    Paul summed up the whole matter of his preaching in the sentence,  \"Repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.\" In some of  the best Latin translations this passage in Acts 20th is rendered,  \"_Conversion to God_;\" also in Hebrews, 6th chapter, we read, \"And  _conversion_ from dead works.\" Such is more clear and natural; but if we  should read, according to modern theology, _sorrow_ towards God, and  _sorrow_ from dead works, it would sound very unnatural, and almost  ridiculous. This is a grand argument in favor of the reading of the  _Geneva text_, which reads, \"_Amend your lives_ and _turn_, that your  sins may be blotted out.\" But if heaven may be gained at an easier and  cheaper rate, how is it that we are so frequently and so plainly assured  that without actual newness of life, holiness and sanctification unto  obedience, there is no hope, no possibility of salvation? John the  Baptist, preaching repentance, said: \"Every tree that bringeth not forth  good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.\" It is not the leaves,  simply, of a profession, nor the blossoms of good purposes and  intentions, but the fruit, _the fruit only_, that will save us from the  fire. \"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and  cast into the fire.\"    Our Savior said, \"Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall  enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my father  who is in heaven.\" After he had delivered all the beautiful precepts  found in the lesson given upon the mount he closed up all by saying, \"He  that heareth these sayings of mine and doth them not I will liken him to  a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand, and when the rain  descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that  house, it fell, and great was the fall of it.\" They that are Christ's  have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts. If they have not  done this, and so attained fitness of character to dwell with God, it  matters not what their sorrow has been, nor their intentions, they will  not enter the kingdom of God.    Paul says, \"The works of the flesh are these: adultery, fornication,  uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,  emulations, wrath, strife, seditious, heresies, envyings, murders,  drunkenness, revelings, of which I forewarn you, as I have told you in  time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of  God.\" He does not say they who have done such things shall not be saved,  but just the contrary, for he adds: \"Such were some of you, but ye are  washed, but ye are sanctified;\" but he teaches the doctrine that those  who do such things and do not amend their lives shall not be excused by  any pretense of sorrow and good purposes; they \"shall not inherit the  kingdom of God.\" \"In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth  anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28672"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. 9.

THE DIVINITY OF OUR RELIGION AS CONCEDED BY ITS ENEMIES.      Voltaire says, \"I am ever apprehensive of being mistaken; but all  monuments give me sufficient evidence that the polished nations of  antiquity acknowledged a supreme God. There is not a book, not a medal,  not a bas-relief, not an inscription, in which Juno, Minerva, Neptune,  Mars, or any of the other deities, is spoken of as a creating being, the  sovereign of all nature.    \"On the contrary, the most ancient profane books that we have--Hesiod  and Homer--represent their Zeus as the only thunderer, the only master  of gods and men; he even punishes the other gods; he ties Juno with a  chain, and drives Apollo out of heaven.    \"The ancient religion of the Brahmins explains itself in a sublime  manner, concerning the unity and power of God, in these words found in  the 2d chapter of the Shastah, 'The Eternal, absorbed in the  contemplation of his own existence, resolved, in the fullness of time,  to communicate his glory and his essence to beings capable of feeling  and partaking his beatitude, as well as of contributing to his glory.  The Eternal willed it, and they were. He formed them partly of his own  essence, capable of perfection or imperfection, _according to their  will_. The Eternal first created Brahma, Vishna and Siva, then Mozazor  and all the multitude of the angels. The Eternal gave the pre-eminence  to Brahma, Vishna and Siva. Brahma was the prince of the angelic army.  Vishna and Siva were his coadjutors. The Eternal divided the angelic  army into several bands, and gave to each a chief. They adored the  Eternal, ranged around his throne, each in the degree assigned him.  There was harmony in heaven.'    \"The Chinese, ancient as they are, come after the Indians. They have  acknowledged one only God. They have no subordinate gods. The Magi of  Chaldea, the Sabeans, acknowledge but one supreme God, whom they adored  in the stars, which are his work. The Persians adored him in the sun.  The sphere placed on the frontispiece of the temple of Memphis was the  emblem of one only and perfect God, called _Knef_ by the Egyptians. The  title of Deus Optimum Maximus was never given by the Romans to any but  Jupiter.\" Voltaire adds, \"This great truth, which we have elsewhere  pointed out, can not be too often repeated. Jupiter was the translation  of the Greek word Zeus, and Zeus a translation of the Phenician word  Jehovah.\"--_Philosophical Dictionary, vol. 1, pp. 374, 375._    Ever remember, that there is, in all the ancient theories of gods, the  grand idea of one supreme God. Unbelievers keep this great truth out of  sight.    R. Dale Owen says of Christ, \"His character and his doings, as exhibited  in the gospel biographies--are almost as marvellous as the system he  gave to the world. They accord neither with his country nor with his  time, nor--except as one illustrious example disclosing to us what man  may be--with that human race with which, on a hundred occasions, he  expressly identified himself. It were difficult in this connection, to  improve on the words of an anglican clergyman, whose early death was a  misfortune to the church he adorned. 'Once in the roll of ages, out of  innumerable failures, from the stock of human nature, one bud developed  into a faultless flower. One perfect specimen of humanity has God  exhibited on earth. As if the life blood of every nation were in his  veins, and that which is best and truest in every man, and that which  is tenderest and gentlest and purest in every woman, were in his  character; he is emphatically the Son of Man.' 'Christ is the crowning  exemplar of the Inspired; for he, while abiding among us, lived, more  nearly than any other of God's creatures here, within sight and hearing  of his future home. Therefore it is that his teachings are the noblest  fruits of inspiration.'\"    A.J. Davis says: \"He (Christ) was A TYPE OF A PERFECT MAN, both in  physical and spiritual qualifications. His general organization was  indeed remarkable, inasmuch as he possessed, combined, the perfection of  physical beauty, mental powers and refined accomplishments. He was  generally beloved during his youth for his great powers of discernment,  his thirst after knowledge, and his disposition to inquire into the  causes of mental phenomena, of the conditions of society, and of the  visible manifestations of nature. He was also much beloved for his PURE  natural sympathy for all who were suffering afflictions either of a  physical or mental character--It is true that at the age of twelve years  he was admitted to the presence of the learned doctors. There he  manifested some of his powers of discernment, interior and natural  philosophy, unsophistocated love, simplicity of expression, kindness of  disposition, and universal sympathy and benovolence. These he displayed  with all the naturalness and spontaneousness resulting from the  promptings of an uncorrupted and purely-organized spiritual principle.\"    Gregg, a Deist, says: \"I value the religion of Jesus, as containing more  truth, purer truth, higher truth, than has ever yet been given to man.  Much of his teaching I unhesitatingly receive as, to the best of my  judgment, unimprovable and unsurpassable--fitted, if obeyed, to make  earth all that a finite and material scene can be, and man only a little  lower than the angels. 'Not every one that saith unto me, Lord! Lord; *  * * * * * but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.' 'By  their fruits ye shall know them;' 'I will have mercy, and not  sacrifice;' 'Be not a slothful hearer only, but a doer of the work;'  'Woe unto ye, Scribes and Pharisees, for ye pay tithes of mint, and  anise and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the law, justice,  mercy, and temperance, (faith left out.)'    \"'The _enforcement of purity of heart as the security for purity of  life, and of the government of the thoughts, as the originators and  forerunners of action_.' 'He that looketh on a woman, to lust after her,  hath committed adultery with her already in his heart;' 'Out of the  heart proceed murders, adulteries, thefts, false witness, blasphemies;  these are the things which defile a man.'    \"_Universal good-will toward men._--'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as  thyself;' 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, that do ye  also unto them, for this is the law and the prophets.'    \"_Forgiveness of injuries._--'Love your enemies; do good to them that  hate you, pray for them which dispitefully use you and persecute you;'  'Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against  us;' 'I say not unto thee, until seven times, but until seventy times  seven;' 'If ye love them only that love you, what reward have ye? Do not  even publicans the same?'    \"_The necessity of self-sacrifice in the cause of duty._--'Blessed are  they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake;' 'If any man will be  my disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and  follow me;' 'If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from  thee;' 'No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is  fit for the kingdom of God.'    \"_Humility._--'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth;'  'He that humbleth himself shall be exalted;' 'He that is greatest among  you, let him be your servant.'    \"_Genuine sincerity; being not seeming._--'Take heed that ye do not your  alms before men, to be seen of them;' 'When thou prayest, enter into thy  closet and shut thy door;' 'When thou fastest, anoint thine head, and  wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast.' All these sublime  precepts need no miracle, no voice from the clouds, to recommend them  to our allegiance, or to assure us of their divinity; they command  obedience by virtue of their inherit rectitude and beauty, and vindicate  their author _as himself the one towering perpetual miracle of  history_.\"--_Creed of Christendom, pp. 318, 319._    \"We hold that God has so arranged matters in this beautiful and  well-ordered, but mysteriously-governed universe, that one great mind  after another will arise from time to time, as such are needed, to  discover and flash forth before the eyes of men the truths that are  wanted, and the amount of truth that can be borne. We conceive that this  is effected by endowing them, or by having arranged that nature and the  course of events shall send them into the world endowed with that  superior mental and moral organization in which grand truths, sublime  gleams of spiritual light, will spontaneously and inevitably arise. Such  a one we believe was Jesus of Nazareth, the most exalted religious  genius whom God ever sent upon the earth; in himself an embodied  revelation; humanity in its divinest phase, 'God manifest in the flesh,'  according to eastern hyperbole; an exemplar given in an early age of the  world to show what man may and should become in the course of ages; in  his progress towards the realization of his destiny; an individual  gifted with a grand, clear intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization,  marvelous moral intuitions, and a perfectly balanced moral being; and  who, by virtue of these endowments, saw further than all other men,  'Beyond the verge of that blue sky, where God's sublimest secrets  lie.'\"--_Creed of Christendom, pp. 306, 307._    We regard him * * as the perfection of the spiritual character, as  surpassing all men of all times in the closeness and depth of his  communion with the Father. In reading his sayings, we feel that we are  holding converse with the wisest, purest, noblest being that ever  clothed thought in the poor language of humanity. In studying his life  we feel that we are following the footsteps of the highest ideal"]]]
