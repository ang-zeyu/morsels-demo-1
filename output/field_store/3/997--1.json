An Aid to Knowledge of Our Wild Flowers and Their Insect Visitors    By Neltje Blanchan          PREFACE    Surely a foreword of explanation is called for from one who has  the temerity to offer a surfeited public still another book on  wild flowers. Inasmuch as science has proved that almost every  blossom in the world is everything it is because of its necessity  to attract insect friends or to repel its foes - its form,  mechanism, color, markings, odor, time of opening and closing,  and its season of blooming being the result of natural selection  by that special insect upon which each depends more or less  absolutely for help in perpetuating its species - it seems fully  time that the vitally important and interesting relationship  existing between our common wild flowers and their winged  benefactors should be presented in a popular book.    Is it enough to know merely the name of the flower you meet in  the meadow? The blossom has an inner meaning, hopes and fears  that inspire its brief existence, a scheme of salvation for its  species in the struggle for survival that it has been slowly  perfecting with some insect's help through the ages. It is not a  passive thing to be admired by human eyes, nor does it waste its  sweetness on the desert air. It is a sentient being, impelled to  act intelligently through the same strong desires that animate  us, and endowed with certain powers differing only in degree, but  not in kind, from those of the animal creation. Desire ever  creates form.    Do you doubt it? Then study the mechanism of one of our common  orchids or milkweeds that are adjusted with such marvelous  delicacy to the length of a bee's tongue or of a butterfly's leg;  learn why so many flowers have sticky calices or protective  hairs; why the skunk cabbage, purple trillium, and carrion flower  emit a fetid odor while other flowers, especially the white or  pale yellow night bloomers, charm with their delicious breath;  see if you cannot discover why the immigrant daisy already  whitens our fields with descendants as numerous as the sands of  the seashore, whereas you may tramp a whole day without finding a  single native ladies' slipper. What of the sundew that not only  catches insects, but secretes gastric juice to digest them? What  of the bladderwort, in whose inflated traps tiny crustaceans are  imprisoned, or the pitcher plant, that makes soup of its guests?  Why are gnats and flies seen about certain flowers, bees,  butterflies, moths or humming birds about others, each visitor  choosing the restaurant most to his liking? With what infinite  pains the wants of each guest are catered to! How relentlessly  are pilferers punished! The endless devices of the more ambitious  flowers to save their species from degeneracy by close inbreeding  through fertilization with their own pollen, alone prove the  operation of Mind through them. How plants travel, how they send  seeds abroad in the world to found new colonies, might be studied  with profit by Anglo-Saxon expansionists. Do vice and virtue  exist side by side in the vegetable world also? Yes, and every  sinner is branded as surely as was Cain. The dodder, Indian pipe,  broomrape and beech-drops wear the floral equivalent of the  striped suit and the shaved head. Although claiming most  respectable and exalted kinsfolk, they are degenerates not far  above the fungi. In short, this is a universe that we live in;  and all that share the One Life are one in essence, for natural  law is spiritual law. \"Through Nature to God,\" flowers show a way  to the scientist lacking faith.    Although it has been stated by evolutionists for many years that  in order to know the flowers, their insect relationships must  first be understood, it is believed that \"Nature's Garden\" is the  first American work to explain them in any considerable number of  species. Dr. Asa Gray, William Hamilton Gibson, Clarence Moores  Weed, and Miss Maud Going in their delightful books or lectures  have shown the interdependence of a score or more of different  blossoms and their insect visitors. Hidden away in the  proceedings of scientific societies' technical papers are the  invaluable observations of such men as Dr. William Trelease of  Wisconsin and Professor Charles Robertson of Illinois. To the  latter especially, I am glad to acknowledge my indebtedness.  Sprengel, Darwin, Muller, Delpino, and Lubbock, among others,  have given the world classical volumes on European flora only,  but showing a vast array of facts which the theory of adaptation  to insects alone correlates and explains. That the results of  illumining researches should be so slow in enlightening the  popular mind can be due only to the technical, scientific  language used in setting them forth, language as foreign to the  average reader as Chinese, and not to be deciphered by the  average student either, without the help of a glossary. These  writings, as well as the vast array of popular books - too many  for individual mention - have been freely consulted after studies  made afield.    To Sprengel belongs the glory of first exalting flowers above the  level of botanical specimens. After studying the wild geranium he  became convinced, as he wrote in 1787, that \"the wise Author of  Nature has not made even a single hair without a definite design.  A hundred years before, one, Nehemias Grew, had said that it was  necessary for pollen to reach the stigma of a flower in order  that it might set fertile seed, and Linnaeus bad to come to his  rescue with conclusive evidence to convince a doubting world that  he was right. Sprengel made the next step forward, but his  writings lay neglected over seventy years because he advanced the  then incredible and only partially true statement that a flower  is fertilized by insects which carry its pollen from its anthers  to its stigma. In spite of his discoveries that the hairs within  the wild geranium protect its nectar from rain for the insect  benefactor's benefit; that most flowers which secrete nectar have  what he termed \"honey guides\" - spots of bright color, heavy  veining, or some such pathfinder for the visitor on the petals;  that sometimes the male flowers, the staminate ones, are  separated from the seed-bearing or pistillate ones on distinct  plants, he left it to Darwin to show that cross-fertilization by  insects, the transfer of pollen from one blossom to another - not  from anthers to stigma of the same flower - is the great end to  which so much marvelous floral mechanism is adapted. The wind is  a wasteful, uncertain pollen distributor. Insects transfer it  more economically, especially the more highly organized and  industrious ones. In a few instances hummingbirds, as well,  unwittingly do the flower's bidding while they feast now here,  now there. In spite of Sprengel's most patient and scientific  research, that shed great light on the theory of natural  selection a half century before Darwin advanced it, he never knew  that flowers are nearly always sterile to pollen of another  species when carried to them on the bodies of insect visitors, or  that cross-pollenized blossoms defeat the self-pollinated ones in  the struggle for survival. These facts Darwin proved in endless  experiments.    Because bees depend absolutely upon flowers, not only for their  own food but for that of future generations for whom they labor;  because they are the most diligent of all visitors, and are  rarely diverted from one species of flower to another while on  their rounds collecting, as they must, both nectar and pollen, it  follows they are the most important fertilizing agents. It is  estimated that, should they perish, more than half the flowers in  the world would be exterminated with them! Australian farmers  imported clover from Europe, and although they had luxuriant  fields of it, no seed was set for next year's planting, because  they had failed to import the bumblebee. After his arrival, their  loss was speedily made good.    Ages before men cultivated gardens, they had tiny helpers they  knew not of. Gardeners win all the glory of producing a Lawson  pink or a new chrysanthemum; but only for a few seasons do they  select, hybridize, according to their own rules of taste. They  take up the work where insects left it off after countless  centuries of toil. Thus it is to the night-flying moth, long of  tongue, keen of scent, that we are indebted for the deep, white,  fragrant Easter lily, for example, and not to the florist; albeit  the moth is in his turn indebted to the lily for the length of  his tongue and his keen nerves: neither could have advanced  without the other. What long vistas through the ages of creation  does not this interdependence of flowers and insects open!    Over five hundred flowers in this book have been classified  according to color, because it is believed that the novice, with  no knowledge of botany whatever, can most readily identify the  specimen found afield by this method, which has the added  advantage of being the simple one adopted by the higher insects  ages before books were written. Technicalities have been avoided  in the text wherever possible, not to discourage the beginner  from entering upon one of the most enjoyable and elevating  branches of Nature study. The scientific names and classification  follow that method adopted by the International Botanical  Congress which has now superseded all others; nevertheless the  titles employed by Gray, with which older botanists in this  country are familiar, are also indicated where they differ from  the new nomenclature.

No silence is sinister until it acquires  a background of understandable menace. Here there was only the night  quiet of Maternity, the silence of noiseless rubber heels on the  hospital corridor floor, the faint brush of starched white skirts  brushing through doorways into darkened and semi-darkened rooms.    But there was something wrong with the silence in the \"basket room\" of  Maternity, the glass-walled room containing row on row, the tiny hopes  of tomorrow. The curtain was drawn across the window through which,  during visiting hours, peered the proud fathers who did the hoping. The  night-light was dim.    The silence should not have been there.    Lorry Kane, standing in the doorway, looked out over the rows of silent  baskets and felt her blonde hair tighten at the roots. The tightening  came from instinct, even before her brain had a chance to function, from  the instincts and training of a registered nurse.    Thirty-odd babies grouped in one room and--_complete silence_.    Not a single whimper. Not one tiny cry of protest against the annoying  phenomenon of birth.    Thirty babies--_dead_? That was the thought that flashed, unbidden, into  Lorry's pretty head. The absurdity of it followed swiftly, and Lorry  moved on rubber soles between a line of baskets. She bent down and  explored with practiced fingers.    A warm, living bundle in a white basket.    The feeling of relief was genuine. Relief, even from an absurdity, is a  welcome thing. Lorry smiled and bent closer.    Staring up at Lorry from the basket were two clear blue eyes. Two eyes,  steady and fixed in a round baby face. An immobile, pink baby face  housing two blue eyes that stared up into Lorry's with a quiet  concentration that was chilling.    Lorry said, \"What's the matter with you?\" She spoke in a whisper and was  addressing herself. She'd gone short on sleep lately--the only way,  really, to get a few hours with Pete. Pete was an interne at General  Hospital, and the kind of a homely grinning carrot-top a girl like Lorry  could put into dreams as the center of a satisfactory future.    But all this didn't justify a case of jitters in the \"basket room.\"    Lorry said. \"Hi, short stuff,\" and lifted Baby Newcomb--Male, out of his  crib for a cuddling.    Baby Newcomb didn't object. The blue eyes came closer. The week-old eyes  with the hundred-year-old look. Lorry laid the bundle over her shoulder  and smiled into the dimness.    \"You want to be president, Shorty?\" Lorry felt the warmth of a new life,  felt the little body wriggle in snug contentment. \"I wouldn't advise it.  Tough job.\" Baby Newcomb twisted in his blanket. Lorry stiffened.    _Snug contentment?_    Lorry felt two tiny hands clutch and dig into her throat. Not just  pawing baby hands. Little fingers that reached and explored for the  windpipe.    She uncuddled the soft bundle, held it out. There were the eyes. She  chilled. No imagination here. No spectre from lack of sleep.    Ancient murder-hatred glowing in new-born eyes.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Careful, you fool! You'll drop this body.\" A thin piping voice. A  shrill symphony in malevolence.    Fear weakened Lorry. She found a chair and sat down. She held the boy  baby in her hands. Training would not allow her to drop Baby Newcomb.  Even if she had fainted, she would not have let go.           *       *       *       *       *    The shrill voice: \"It was stupid of me. Very stupid.\"    Lorry was cold, sick, mute.    \"Very stupid. These hands are too fragile. There are no muscles in the  arms. I couldn't have killed you.\"    \"Please--I ...\"    \"Dreaming? No. I'm surprised at--well, at your surprise. You have a  trained mind. You should have learned, long ago, to trust your senses.\"    \"I don't understand.\"    \"Don't look at the doorway. Nobody's coming in. Look at me. Give me a  little attention and I'll explain.\"    \"Explain?\" Lorry pulled her eyes down to the cherubic little face as she  parroted dully.    \"I'll begin by reminding you that there are more things in existence  than your obscene medical books tell you about.\"    \"Who are you? What are you?\"    \"One of those things.\"    \"You're not a baby!\"    \"Of course not. I'm ...\" The beastly, brittle voice drifted into silence  as though halted by an intruding thought. Then the thought voiced--voiced  with a yearning at once pathetic and terrible: \"It would be nice to kill  you. Someday I will. Someday I'll kill you if I can find you.\"    \"Why? Why?\" Insane words in an insane world. But life had not stopped  even though madness had taken over. \"Why?\"    The voice was matter-of-fact again. No more time for pleasant daydreams.  \"I'm something your books didn't tell you about. Naturally you're  bewildered. Did you ever hear of a bodyless entity?\"    Lorry shuddered in silence.    \"You've heard of bodyless entities, of course--but you denied their  existence in your smug world of precise tidy detail. I'm a bodyless  entity. I'm one of a swarm. We come from a dimension your mind wouldn't  accept even if I explained it, so I'll save words. We of the swarm seek  unfoldment--fulfillment--even as you in your stupid, blind world. Do you  want to hear more?\"    \"I ...\"    \"You're a fool, but I enjoy practicing with these new vocal chords, just  as I enjoyed flexing the fingers and muscles. That's why I revealed  myself. We are, basically of course, parasites. In the dimension where  we exist in profusion, evolution has provided for us. There, we seek out  and move into a dimensional entity far more intelligent than yourself.  We destroy it in a way you wouldn't understand, and it is not important  that you should. In fact, I can't see what importance there is in your  existing at all.\"    \"You plan to--kill all these babies?\"    \"Let me congratulate you. You've finally managed to voice an intelligent  question. The answer is, no. We aren't strong enough to kill them. We  dwelt in a far more delicate dimension than this one and all was in  proportion. That was our difficulty when we came here. We could find no  entities weak enough to take possession of until we came upon this  roomful of infants.\"    \"Then, if you're helpless ...\"    \"What do we plan to do? That's quite simple. These material entities  will grow. We will remain attached--ingrained, so to speak. When the  bodies enlarge sufficiently ...\"    \"_Thirty potential assassins...._\" Lorry spoke again to herself, then  hurled the words back into her own mind as her sickness deepened.    The shrill chirping: \"What do you mean, potential? The word expresses a  doubt. Here there is none.\" The entity's chuckle sounded like a baby,  content over a full bottle. \"Thirty certain assassins.\"    \"But why must you kill?\"    Lorry was sure the tiny shoulders shrugged. \"Why? I don't know. I never  thought to wonder. Why must you join with a man and propagate some day?  Why do you feel sorry for what you term an unfortunate? Explain your  instincts and I'll explain mine.\"    Lorry felt herself rising. Stiffly, she put Baby Newcomb back into his  basket. As she did so, a ripple of shrill, jerky laughter crackled  through the room. Lorry put her hands to her ears. \"You know I can't say  anything. You'd keep quiet. They'd call me mad.\"    \"Precisely.\"    Malicious laughter, like driven sleet, cut into her ears as she fled  from the room.           *       *       *       *       *    Peter Larchmont, M.D., was smoking a quick cigarette by an open  fire-escape door on the third floor. He turned as Lorry came down the  corridor, flipped his cigarette down into the alley and grinned. \"Women  shouldn't float on rubber heels,\" he said. \"A man should have warning.\"    Lorry came close. \"Kiss me. Kiss me--hard.\"    Pete kissed her, then held her away. \"You're trembling. Anticipation,  pet?\" He looked into her face and the grin faded. \"Lorry, what is it?\"    \"Pete--Pete. I'm crazy. I've gone mad. Hold me.\"    He could have laughed, but he had looked closely into her eyes and he  was a doctor. He didn't laugh. \"Tell me. Just stand here. I'll hang onto  you and you tell me.\"    \"The babies--they've gone mad.\" She clung to him. \"Not exactly that.  Something's taken them over. Something terrible. Oh, Pete! Nobody would  believe me.\"    \"I believe the end result,\" he said, quietly. \"That's what I'm for,  angel. When you shake like this I'll always believe. But I'll have to  know more. And I'll hunt for an answer.\"    \"There isn't any answer, Pete. I _know_.\"    \"We'll still look. Tell me more, first.\"    \"There isn't any more.\" Her eyes widened as she stared into his with the  shock of a new thought. \"Oh, Lord! One of them talked to me, but maybe  he--or it--won't talk to you. Then you'll never know for sure! You'll  think I'm ...\"    \"Stop it. Quit predicting what I'll do. Let's go to the nursery.\"    They went to the nursery and stayed there for three-quarters of an  hour. They left with the tinny laughter filling their minds--and the  last words of the monstrous entity.    \"We'll say no more, of course. Perhaps even this incident has been  indiscreet. But it's in the form of a celebration. Never before has a  whole swarm gotten through. Only a single entity on rare occasions.\"    Pete leaned against the corridor wall and wiped his face with the sleeve  of his jacket. \"We're the only ones who know,\" he said.    \"Or ever will know.\" Lorry pushed back a lock of his curly hair. She  wanted to kiss him, but this didn't seem to be the place or the time.    \"We can never tell anyone.\"    \"We'd look foolish.\"    \"We've got a horror on our hands and we can't pass it on.\"    \"What are we going to do?\" Lorry asked.    \"I don't know. Let's recap a little. Got a cigarette?\"    They"]]]
