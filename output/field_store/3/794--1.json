JACK                                   1900          PREFATORY NOTE      In writing this volume my aim has been to present an unvarnished  tale of the circumstances--extending over nearly half a  century--which have brought about the present crisis in South  Africa. Consequently, it has been necessary to collate the opinions  of the best authorities on the subject. My acknowledgments are due  to the distinguished authors herein quoted for much valuable  information, throwing light on the complications that have been  accumulating so long, and that owe their origin to political  blundering and cosmopolitan scheming rather than to the racial  antagonism between Briton and Boer.
