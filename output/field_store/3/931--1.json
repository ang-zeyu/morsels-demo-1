It was just on the edge of the twilight; and the  little Peppers, all except Ben, the oldest of the flock, were enjoying  a \"breathing spell,\" as their mother called it, which meant some  quiet work suitable for the hour. All the \"breathing spell\" they could  remember however, poor things; for times were always hard with them  nowadays; and since the father died, when Phronsie was a baby, Mrs.  Pepper had had hard work to scrape together money enough to put bread  into her children's mouths, and to pay the rent of the little brown  house.    But she had met life too bravely to be beaten down now. So with a stout  heart and a cheery face, she had worked away day after day at making  coats, and tailoring and mending of all descriptions; and she had seen  with pride that couldn't be concealed, her noisy, happy brood growing  up around her, and filling her heart with comfort, and making the little  brown house fairly ring with jollity and fun.    \"Poor things!\" she would say to herself, \"they haven't had any bringing  up; they've just scrambled up!\" And then she would set her lips together  tightly, and fly at her work faster than ever. \"I must get schooling for  them some way, but I don't see how!\"    Once or twice she had thought, \"Now the time is coming!\" but it never  did: for winter shut in very cold, and it took so much more to feed and  warm them, that the money went faster than ever. And then, when the way  seemed clear again, the store changed hands, so that for a long time she  failed to get her usual supply of sacks and coats to make; and that  made sad havoc in the quarters and half-dollars laid up as her nest egg.  But--\"Well, it'll come some time,\" she would say to herself; \"because it  must!\" And so at it again she would fly, brisker than ever.    \"To help mother,\" was the great ambition of all the children, older  and younger; but in Polly's and Ben's souls, the desire grew so  overwhelmingly great as to absorb all lesser thoughts. Many and vast  were their secret plans, by which they were to astonish her at some  future day, which they would only confide--as they did everything  else--to one another. For this brother and sister were everything to  each other, and stood loyally together through \"thick and thin.\"    Polly was ten, and Ben one year older; and the younger three of the  \"Five Little Peppers,\" as they were always called, looked up to them  with the intensest admiration and love. What they failed to do, couldn't  very well be done by any One!    \"Oh dear!\" exclaimed Polly as she sat over in the corner by the window  helping her mother pull out basting threads from a coat she had just  finished, and giving an impatient twitch to the sleeve, \"I do wish we  could ever have any light--just as much as we want!\"    \"You don't need any light to see these threads,\" said Mrs. Pepper,  winding up hers carefully, as she spoke, on an old spool. \"Take care,  Polly, you broke that; thread's dear now.\"    \"I couldn't help it,\" said Polly, vexedly; \"it snapped; everything's  dear now, it seems to me! I wish we could have--oh! ever an' ever so  many candles; as many as we wanted. I'd light 'em all, so there! and  have it light here one night, anyway!\"    \"Yes, and go dark all the rest of the year, like as anyway,\" observed  Mrs. Pepper, stopping to untie a knot. \"Folks who do so never have any  candles,\" she added, sententiously.    \"How many'd you have, Polly?\" asked Joel, curiously, laying down his  hammer, and regarding her with the utmost anxiety.    \"Oh, two hundred!\" said Polly, decidedly. \"I'd have two hundred, all in  a row!\"    \"Two hundred candles!\" echoed Joel, in amazement. \"My whockety! what a  lot!\"    \"Don't say such dreadful words, Joel,\" put in Polly, nervously, stopping  to pick up her spool of basting thread that was racing away all by  itself; \"tisn't nice.\"    \"Tisn't worse than to wish you'd got things you haven't,\" retorted Joel.  \"I don't believe you'd light 'em all at once,\" he added, incredulously.    \"Yes, I would too!\" replied Polly, reckessly; \"two hundred of 'em, if I  had a chance; all at once, so there, Joey Pepper!\"    \"Oh,\" said little Davie, drawing a long sigh. \"Why, 'twould be just like  heaven, Polly! but wouldn't it cost money, though!\"    \"I don't care,\" said Polly, giving a flounce in her chair, which snapped  another thread; \"oh dear me! I didn't mean to, mammy; well, I wouldn't  care how much money it cost, we'd have as much light as we wanted, for  once; so!\"    \"Mercy!\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"you'd have the house afire! Two hundred  candles! who ever heard of such a thing!\"    \"Would they burn?\" asked Phronsie, anxiously, getting up from the floor  where she was crouching with David, overseeing Joel nail on the cover of  an old box; and going to Polly's side she awaited her answer patiently.    \"Burn?\" said Polly. \"There, that's done now, mamsie dear!\" And she put  the coat, with a last little pat, into her mother's lap. \"I guess they  would, Phronsie pet.\" And Polly caught up the little girl, and spun  round and round the old kitchen till they were both glad to stop.    \"Then,\" said Phronsie, as Polly put her down, and stood breathless after  her last glorious spin, \"I do so wish we might, Polly; oh, just this  very one minute!\"    And Phronsie clasped her fat little hands in rapture at the thought.    \"Well,\" said Polly, giving a look up at the old clock in the corner;  \"deary me! it's half-past five; and most time for Ben to come home!\"    Away she flew to get supper. So for the next few moments nothing was  heard but the pulling out of the old table into the middle of the floor,  the laying the cloth, and all the other bustle attendant upon the  being ready for Ben. Polly went skipping around, cutting the bread,  and bringing dishes; only stopping long enough to fling some scraps of  reassuring nonsense to the two boys, who were thoroughly dismayed at  being obliged to remove their traps into a corner.    Phronsie still stood just where Polly left her. Two hundred candles! oh!  what could it mean! She gazed up to the old beams overhead, and around  the dingy walls, and to the old black stove, with the fire nearly out,  and then over everything the kitchen contained, trying to think how it  would seem. To have it bright and winsome and warm! to suit Polly--\"oh!\"  she screamed.    \"Goodness!\" said Polly, taking her head out of the old cupboard in the  corner, \"how you scared me, Phronsie!\"    \"Would they ever go out?\" asked the child gravely, still standing where  Polly left her.    \"What?\" asked Polly, stopping with a dish of cold potatoes in her hand.  \"What, Phronsie?\"    \"Why, the candles,\" said the child, \"the ever-an'-ever so many pretty  lights!\"    \"Oh, my senses!\" cried Polly, with a little laugh, \"haven't you  forgotten that! Yes--no, that is, Phronsie, if we could have 'em at all,  we wouldn't ever let 'em go out!\"    \"Not once?\" asked Phronsie, coming up to Polly with a little skip, and  nearly upsetting her, potatoes and all--\"not once, Polly, truly?\"    \"No, not forever-an'-ever,\" said Polly; \"take care, Phronsie! there goes  a potato; no, we'd keep 'em always!\"    \"No, you don't want to,\" said Mrs. Pepper, coming out of the bedroom in  time to catch the last words; \"they won't be good to-morrow; better have  them to-night, Polly.\"    \"Ma'am!\" said Polly, setting down her potato-dish on the table, and  staring at her mother with all her might--\"have what, mother?\"    \"Why, the potatoes, to be sure,\" replied Mrs. Pepper; \"didn't you say  you better keep them, child?\"    \"Twasn't potatoes--at all,\" said Polly, with a little gasp; \"twas--dear  me! here's Ben!\" For the door opened, and Phronsie, with a scream of  delight, bounded into Ben's arms.    \"It's just jolly,\" said Ben, coming in, his chubby face all aglow, and  his big blue eyes shining so honest and true; \"it's just jolly to get  home! supper ready, Polly?\"    \"Yes,\" said Polly; \"that is--all but--\" and she dashed off for  Phronsie's eating apron.    \"Sometime,\" said Phronsie, with her mouth half full, when the meal was  nearly over, \"we're going to be awful rich; we are, Ben, truly!\"    \"No?\" said Ben, affecting the most hearty astonishment; \"you don't say  so, Chick!\"    \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, shaking her yellow head very wisely at him, and  diving down into her cup of very weak milk and water to see if Polly had  put any sugar in by mistake--a proceeding always expectantly observed.  \"Yes, we are really, Bensie, very dreadful rich!\"    \"I wish we could be rich now, then,\" said Ben, taking another generous  slice of the brown bread; \"in time for mamsie's birthday,\" and he cast a  sorrowful glance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#1)"],[1,"(https://www.pgdp.net)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Saunders Company  Philadelphia          TO THE MEMORY OF    JOHN WICHENFORD WASHBOURN, C.M.G., M.D., F.R.C.P.    Physician to Guy's Hospital and Lecturer on Bacteriology in the  Medical School, and Physician to the London Fever Hospital    MY TEACHER, FRIEND, AND CO-WORKER          PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION      Bacteriology is essentially a practical study, and even the elements of  its technique can only be taught by personal instruction in the  laboratory. This is a self-evident proposition that needs no emphasis,  yet I venture to believe that the former collection of tried and proved  methods has already been of some utility, not only to the student in the  absence of his teacher, but also to isolated workers in laboratories far  removed from centres of instruction, reminding them of forgotten details  in methods already acquired. If this assumption is based on fact no  further apology is needed for the present revised edition in which the  changes are chiefly in the nature of additions--rendered necessary by  the introduction of new methods during recent years.    I take this opportunity of expressing my deep sense of obligation to my  confrere in the Physiological Department of our medical school--Mr. J.  H. Ryffel, B. C., B. Sc.--who has revised those pages dealing with the  analysis of the metabolic products of bacterial life; to successive  colleagues in the Bacteriological Department of Guy's Hospital, for  their ready co-operation in working out or in testing new methods; and  finally to my Chief Laboratory Assistant, Mr. J. C. Turner whose  assistance and experience have been of the utmost value to me in the  preparation of this volume. I have also to thank Mrs. Constant Ponder  for many of the new line drawings and for redrawing a number of the  original cuts.        JOHN W. H. EYRE.        GUY'S HOSPITAL, S. E.      _July, 1913._          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION      In the following pages I have endeavoured to arrange briefly and  concisely the various methods at present in use for the study of  bacteria, and the elucidation of such points in their life-histories as  are debatable or still undetermined.    Of these methods, some are new, others are not; but all are reliable,  only such having been included as are capable of giving satisfactory  results even in the hands of beginners. In fact, the bulk of the matter  is simply an elaboration of the typewritten notes distributed to some of  my laboratory classes in practical and applied bacteriology;  consequently an attempt has been made to present the elements of  bacteriological technique in their logical sequence.    I make no apology for the space devoted to illustrations, nearly all of  which have been prepared especially for this volume; for a picture, if  good, possesses a higher educational value and conveys a more accurate  impression than a page of print; and even sketches of apparatus serve a  distinct purpose in suggesting to the student those alterations and  modifications which may be rendered necessary or advisable by the  character of his laboratory equipment.    The excellent and appropriate terminology introduced by Chester in his  recent work on \"Determinative Bacteriology\" I have adopted in its  entirety, for I consider it only needs to be used to convince one of its  extreme utility, whilst its inclusion in an elementary manual is  calculated to induce in the student habits of accurate observation and  concise description.    With the exception of Section XVII--\"Outlines for the Study of  Pathogenic Bacteria\"--introduced with the idea of completing the volume  from the point of view of the medical and dental student, the work has  been arranged to allow of its use as a laboratory guide by the technical  student generally, whether of brewing, dairying, or agriculture.    So alive am I to its many inperfections that it appears almost  superfluous to state that the book is in no sense intended as a rival to  the many and excellent manuals of bacteriology at present in use, but  aims only at supplementing the usually scanty details of technique, and  at instructing the student how to fit up and adapt apparatus for his  daily work, and how to carry out thoroughly and systematically the  various bacterioscopical analyses that are daily demanded of the  bacteriologist by the hygienist.    Finally, it is with much pleasure that I acknowledge the valuable  assistance received from my late assistant, Mr. J. B. Gall, A. I. C., in  the preparation of the section dealing with the chemical products of  bacterial life, and which has been based upon the work of Lehmann.        JOHN W. H. EYRE.        GUY'S HOSPITAL, S.
