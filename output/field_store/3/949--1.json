LIFE OF SCOTT      I    Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh, August 15, 1771, of an ancient  Scotch clan numbering in its time many a hard rider and good fighter,  and more than one of these petty chieftains, half-shepherd and  half-robber, who made good the winter inroads into their stock of beeves  by spring forays and cattle drives across the English Border. Scott's  great-grandfather was the famous \"Beardie\" of Harden, so called because  after the exile of the Stuart sovereigns he swore never to cut his beard  until they were reinstated; and several degrees farther back he could  point to a still more famous figure, \"Auld Wat of Harden,\" who with his  fair dame, the \"Flower of Yarrow,\" is mentioned in _The Lay of the Last  Minstrel_. The first member of the clan to abandon country life and take  up a sedentary profession, was Scott's father, who settled in Edinburgh  as Writer to the Signet, a position corresponding in Scotland to that of  attorney or solicitor in England. The character of this father, stern,  scrupulous, Calvinistic, with a high sense of ceremonial dignity and a  punctilious regard for the honorable conventions of life, united with  the wilder ancestral strain to make Scott what he was. From \"Auld Wat\"  and \"Beardie\" came his high spirit, his rugged manliness, his chivalric  ideals; from the Writer to the Signet came that power of methodical  labor which made him a giant among the literary workers of his day, and  that delicate sense of responsibility which gave his private life its  remarkable sweetness and beauty.    At the age of eighteen months, Scott was seized with a teething fever  which settled in his right leg and retarded its growth to such an extent  that he was slightly lame for the rest of his life. Possibly this  affliction was a blessing in disguise, since it is not improbable that  Scott's love of active adventure would have led him into the army or the  navy, if he had not been deterred by a bodily impediment; in which case  English history might have been a gainer, but English literature would  certainly have been immeasurably a loser. In spite of his lameness, the  child grew strong enough to be sent on a long visit to his grandfather's  farm at Sandyknowe; and here, lying among the sheep on the windy downs,  playing about the romantic ruins of Smailholm Tower,[1] scampering  through the heather on a tiny Shetland pony, or listening to stories of  the thrilling past told by the old women of the farm, he drank in  sensations which strengthened both the hardiness and the romanticism of  his nature. A story is told of his being found in the fields during a  thunder storm, clapping his hands at each flash of lightning, and  shouting \"Bonny! Bonny!\"--a bit of infantile intrepidity which makes  more acceptable a story of another sort illustrative of his mental  precocity. A lady entering his mother's room found him reading aloud a  description of a shipwreck, accompanying the words with excited comments  and gestures. \"There's the mast gone,\" he cried, \"crash it goes; they  will all perish!\" The lady entered into his agitation with tact, and on  her departure, he told his mother that he liked their visitor, because  \"she was a virtuoso, like himself.\" To her amused inquiry as to what a  virtuoso might be, he replied: \"Don't ye know? why, 'tis one who wishes  to and will know everything.\"    [Footnote: 1 See Scott's ballad \"The Eve of St. John.\"]    As a boy at school in Edinburgh and in Kelso, and afterwards as a  student at the University and apprentice in his father's law office,  Scott took his own way to become a \"virtuoso\"; a rather queer way it  must sometimes have seemed to his good preceptors. He refused  point-blank to learn Greek, and cared little for Latin. His scholarship  was so erratic that he glanced meteor-like from the head to the foot of  his classes and back again, according as luck gave or withheld the  question to which his highly selective memory had retained the answer.  But outside of school hours he was intensely at work to \"know  everything,\" so far as \"everything\" came within the bounds of his  special tastes. Before he was ten years old he had begun to collect  chap-books and ballads. As he grew older he read omnivorously in romance  and history; at school he learned French for the sole purpose of knowing  at first hand the fascinating cycles of old French romance; a little  later he mastered Italian in order to read Dante and Ariosto, and to his  schoolmaster's indignation stoutly championed the claim of the latter  poet to superiority over Homer; a little later he acquired Spanish and  read _Don Quixote_ in the original. With such efforts, however,  considerable as they were for a boy who passionately loved a \"bicker\" in  the streets and who was famed among his comrades for bravery in climbing  the perilous \"kittle nine stanes\" on Castle Rock, he was not content.  Nothing more conclusively shows the genuineness of Scott's romantic  feeling than his willingness to undergo severe mental drudgery in  pursuit of knowledge concerning the old storied days which had  enthralled his imagination. It was no moonshine sentimentality which  kept him hour after hour and day after day in the Advocate's Library,  poring over musty manuscripts, deciphering heraldic devices, tracing  genealogies, and unraveling obscure points of Scottish history. By the  time he was twenty-one he had made himself, almost unconsciously, an  expert paleographer and antiquarian, whose assistance was sought by  professional workers in those branches of knowledge. Carlyle has charged  against Scott that he poured out his vast floods of poetry and romance  without preparation or forethought; that his production was always  impromptu, and rooted in no sufficient past of acquisition. The charge  cannot stand. From his earliest boyhood until his thirtieth year, when  he began his brilliant career as poet and novelist, his life was one  long preparation--very individual and erratic preparation, perhaps, but  none the less earnest and fruitful.    In 1792, Scott, then twenty-one years old, was admitted a member of the  faculty of advocates of Edinburgh. During the five years which elapsed  between this date and his marriage, his life was full to overflowing of  fun and adventure, rich with genial companionship, and with experience  of human nature in all its wild and tame varieties. Ostensibly he was a  student of law, and he did, indeed, devote some serious attention to the  mastery of his profession. But the dry formalities of legal life his  keen humor would not allow him to take quite seriously. On the day when  he was called to the bar, while waiting his turn among the other young  advocates, he turned to his friend, William Clark, who had been called  with him, and whispered, mimicking the Highland lasses who used to stand  at the Cross of Edinburgh to be hired for the harvest: \"We've stood here  an hour by the Tron, hinny, and deil a ane has speered[2] our price.\"  Though Scott never made a legal reputation, either as pleader at the  bar or as an authority upon legal history and principles, it cannot be  doubted that his experience in the Edinburgh courts was of immense  benefit to him. In the first place, his study of the Scotch statutes,  statutes which had taken form very gradually under the pressure of  changing national conditions, gave him an insight into the politics and  society of the past not otherwise to have been obtained. Of still more  value, perhaps, was the association with his young companions in the  profession, and daily contact with the racy personalities which  traditionally haunt all courts of law, and particularly Scotch courts of  law: the first association kept him from the affectation and  sentimentality which is the bane of the youthful romanticist; and the  second enriched his memory with many an odd figure afterward to take its  place, clothed in the colors of a great dramatic imagination, upon the  stage of his stories.    [Footnote 2: Asked.]    Added to these experiences, there were others equally calculated to  enlarge his conception of human nature. Not the least among these he  found in the brilliant literary and artistic society of Edinburgh, to  which his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28297"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, May, 1880 (#1)"],[1,"Christian Foundation,                                       Or,                         Scientific and Religious Journal                                  Vol. 1.

THE OLD COVENANT.--THE SABBATH--THE LAW--THE COMMONWEALTH OF ISRAEL, AND  CHRIST.      The original term, rendered \"Testament\" and \"Covenant,\" occurs  thirty-three times in the New Testament. Greenfield defines it thus: \"Any  disposition, arrangement, institution, or dispensation; hence a testament,  will; a covenant, mutual promises on mutual conditions, or promises with  conditions annexed.\" Secondly, \"A body of laws and precepts to which  certain promises are annexed, promises to which are annexed certain laws;  the books in which the divine laws are contained, the Old Testament, and  especially the Pentateuch.\" Upon a careful examination of these  definitions it will be seen at once that the term \"Testament\" is a good  translation. This is confirmed, in Paul's letter to the Hebrews, in the  inter-changeable use of the terms \"Will,\" \"Covenant\" and \"Testament.\" Our  Sabbatarian brethren claim, that the Old Covenant, which was done away,  was the verbal agreement of the Children of Israel to keep the law of the  decalogue. But this definition is not sufficient. It excludes almost all  that was current in its use. It renders it improper to call it a  \"Testament\" or \"Will,\" because fathers make testaments or wills without  the consent of their children, and these are called dispositions of  estates. Their definition of the term also makes the \"Covenant\" depend  upon the will of man, for covenants, in the sense of agreements, have  nothing to do with those who do not enter into them. Neither can men be  regarded as transgressing a covenant, in the sense of an agreement, unless  they have first placed themselves under its obligations. So, if these men  are right in their definition of the Old Covenant, they are wrong in  trying to fasten its conditions upon all mankind. Their logic also  excludes, from all the promises of the covenant, all those who were  incapable of making an agreement. Hence, infants were left to the  uncovenanted mercies of God. And as for the wicked, who never agreed to  keep those commandments, poor souls! they must be dealt with as violators  of a contract to which they never became a party.    These absurdities, which are legitimately drawn from their own premises,  drive us to the conclusion that their whole theory, upon the covenant  question, is wrong. The apostle Paul says we are the children of a  covenant, which he denominates \"The free woman.\" \"She is the mother of us  all.\" But, according to Sabbatarian logic, they are the children of two  covenants, or women. How is this? One good mother is sufficient. When they  tell you that the old covenant, which was done away, was the people's  agreement to keep the ten commandments, remember that they, by their own  showing, set up the same old covenant by agreeing to keep the ten  commandments. So it is done away, and it is not done away. That is, if the  people say, \"We will keep and do them,\" it is established, but if they  say, \"We will not,\" it is abolished. Again, if it was the people's  agreement that was done away, and the ten commandments were the conditions  of that agreement, then they also are of no force, for the conditions of  an agreement are always void when the contract is nullified. Again, if the  Lord had nothing to do in causing the Old Covenant to be done away, how  did it pass away by the action of one party to it? And how can men enter  into it without the concurring assent of the party of the second part?  Accept the Sabbatarian definition of the term covenant, and it  legitimately follows that none were ever in that covenant save those who  held converse with Jehovah, through Moses, saying, \"All these things will  we observe and do.\" It is an old, trite saying, \"that it takes two to make  an agreement.\" And it also takes two to abrogate an agreement. But these  friends of the seventh day say, The people rendered that old covenant void  by their wickedness, that they were at fault, that God never abrogated it,  that He always stood firm in reference to its conditions and promises,  holding the people to its obligations. Then how was it done away? We will  let Zechariah answer this question: \"And I took my staff, even Beauty, and  cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all  the people. And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock  that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord. And I said unto  them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they  weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me,  Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prized at of them. And  I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the  house of the Lord.\"    Judas Iscariot sold his Savior for thirty pieces of silver, cast the money  down at the feet of the priests in the temple; the priests took it and  purchased the potters' field to bury strangers in. And \"in that day\" the  covenant of God was broken by the Lord. Now, if the Lord broke that old  covenant, it follows that no man enters into it without one more  concurring action upon His part. Upon what mountain has He appeared and  reenacted this covenant? And if it was simply the people's agreement to  keep the ten commandments, how did He make it with all the people of  Israel, seeing many of them were incapable of entering into an agreement?  The truth is this, the Lord made a covenant in the sense of a \"Testament\"  or institution. This sense alone admits of the irresponsible in its  provisions. In the argument from analogy, drawn from the introduction of  the New Testament, our position is confirmed. The Savior's death gave  force to this testament or will, without any concurring action upon the  part of any man or number of men. And it is a covenant in the sense in  which Greenfield defines the term, that is, in the sense of a testament,  or will. This also admits of covenanted or bequeathed blessings for all  the incapable.    The Sabbatarian view of the term covenant, if applied to the \"New  Covenant,\" cuts off all who do not enter into this \"contract.\" But there  is no reason in calling either testament a \"contract.\" An earthly father  may incorporate, among other things, conditions, in his testament, or  will, and it is in force, by his death, even though his children find  fault with it. So it mattered not whether any man in ancient Israel was  satisfied with that ancient \"testament.\" But the Bible nowhere limits the  term covenant to the people's agreement to keep the decalogue. On the  contrary, it is said, \"And He declared unto you His covenant, which He  commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon  two tables of stone.\" Deut. iv, 13. These commandments were AFTER THE  TENOR of all that was given by Moses, as we learn in the thirty-fourth  chapter of Exodus. After Moses had given many precepts, the Lord said,  \"Write thou these words; for after the tenor of these words I have made a  covenant with thee and with Israel. And he wrote upon the tables the words  of the covenant, the ten commandments.\" This covenant, or testament, like  all other institutions which the Lord established with the children of  men, is accompanied with reasons for its existence, and all the laws and  instructions necessary to carry out its principles. The reasons were  placed upon the tables of stone along with the commandments. When  Sabbatarians hang up their copy of those tables, it is always a mutilated,  partial copy. The whole is given to us in the fifth chapter of  Deuteronomy. No Seventh-day Adventist dare exhibit the full copy before  his audience, unless he does it at the peril of his teaching. Here it is:  \"I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from  the house of bondage. Thou shalt have none other Gods before me. Thou  shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is  in heaven above, or that is in earth beneath, or that is in the waters  beneath the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve  them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of  the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them  that hate me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and  keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in  vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in  vain. Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath  commanded thee. Six days thou shalt labor and do all thy work, but the  seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do  any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy  maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy  stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and maid-servant  may rest as well as thou. And remember that thou wast a servant in the  land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a  mighty hand and by a stretched out arm, therefore the Lord thy God  commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day. Honor thy father and thy mother as  the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and  that it may go well with thee in the land"]]]
