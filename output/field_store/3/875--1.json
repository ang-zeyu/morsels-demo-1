Sim. Certain events in the lives of Eve  and Petro and little Solomon Otus are told with reference to his  observations of eave-swallows and screech owls; his trip to an island  off the Maine coast for gull-sketches added greatly to an acquaintance  with Larie; and but for his six-weeks' visit with the loons of \"Immer  Lake,\" much of the story of Gavia could not have been told. Since Mr.  Sim contributed not only the pictures to the book, but many items of  interest to the narrative, it gives the writer pleasure to acknowledge  his cooperation, both as artist and as field-naturalist.

Right in the very heart of Christmas-tree Land there was a forest of  firs that pointed to the sky as straight as steeples. A hush lay over  the forest, as if there were something very wonderful there, that might  be meant for you if you were quiet and waited for it to come. Perhaps  you have felt like that when you walked down the aisle of a church, with  the sun shining through the lovely glass in the windows. Men have often  called the woods \"temples\"; so there is, after all, nothing so very  strange in having a preacher live in the midst of the fir forest that  grew in Christmas-tree Land.    And the sermon itself was not very strange, for it was about peace and  good-will and love and helping the world and being happy--all very  proper things to hear about while the bells in the city churches, way,  way off, were ringing their glad messages from the steeples.    But the minister was a queer one, and his very first words would have  made you smile. Not that you would have laughed at him, you know. You  would have smiled just because he had a way of making you feel happy  from the minute he began.    He sat on a small branch, and looked down from his pulpit with a dear  nod of his little head, which would have made you want to cuddle him in  the hollow of your two hands.    [Illustration: _Firs that pointed to the sky._]    His robe was of gray and white and buff-colored feathers, and he wore a  black-feather cap and bib.    He began by singing his name. \"Chick, D.D.,\" he called. Now, when a  person has \"D.D.\" written after his name, we have a right to think that  he is trying to live so wisely that he can teach us how to be happier,  too. Of course Minister Chick had not earned those letters by studying  in college, like most parsons; but he had learned the secret of a happy  heart in his school in the woods.    Yes, he began his service by singing his name; but the real sermon he  preached by the deeds he did and the life he lived. So, while we listen  to his happy song, we can watch his busy hours, until we are acquainted  with the little black-capped minister who called himself \"Chick, D.D.\"    Chick's Christmas-trees were decorated, and no house in the whole world  had one lovelier that morning than the hundreds that were all about him  as far as he could see. The dark-green branches of the pines and cedars  had held themselves out like arms waiting to be filled, and the snow had  been dropped on them in fluffy masses, by a quiet, windless storm. It  had been very soft and lovely that way--a world all white and green  below, with a sky of wonderful blue that the firs pointed to like  steeples. Then, as if that were not decoration enough, another storm had  come, and had put on the glitter that was brightest at the edge of the  forest where the sun shone on it. The second storm had covered the soft  white with dazzling ice. It had swept across the white-barked birch  trees and their purple-brown branches, and had left them shining all  over. It had dripped icicles from the tips of all the twigs that now  shone in the sunlight brighter than candles, and tinkled like little  bells, when the breezes clicked them together, in a tune that is called,  \"Woodland Music after an Ice-Storm.\"    [Illustration: \"_Woodland Music after an Ice-Storm._\"]    That is the tune that played all about the black-capped bird as he  flitted out of the forest, singing, \"Chick, D.D.,\" as he came. The  clear cold air and the exercise of flying after his night's sleep had  given Chick a good healthy appetite, and he had come out for his  breakfast.    He liked eggs very well, and there were, as he knew, plenty of them on  the birch trees, for many a time he had breakfasted there. Eggs with  shiny black shells, not so big as the head of a pin; so wee, indeed,  that it took a hundred of them or more to make a meal for even little  Chick.    But he wasn't lazy. He didn't have to have eggs cooked and brought to  his table. He loved to hunt for them, and they were never too cold for  him to relish; so out he came to the birch trees, with a cheery \"Chick,  D.D.,\" as if he were saying grace for the good food tucked here and  there along the branches.    When he alighted, though, it wasn't the bark he found, but a hard, thick  coating of ice. The branches rattled together as he moved among them and  the icicles that dangled down rang and clicked as they struck one  another. The ice-storm had locked in Chick's breakfast eggs, and, try as  he would with his little beak, he couldn't get through to find them.    So Chick's Christmas Day began with hardship: for, though he sang gayly  through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25609"],[0,"A Child's Garden of Verses (#1)"],[1,"Child's    Garden    of Verses_      ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON      _Illustrated by    Jessie Willcox Smith_      CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS, _New York_            Copyright, 1905, By CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS      Printed in the United States of America      All rights reserved.

A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES    [Illustration]          BED IN SUMMER          In winter I get up at night      And dress by yellow candle-light.      In summer, quite the other way,      I have to go to bed by day.        I have to go to bed and see      The birds still hopping on the tree,      Or hear the grown-up people's feet      Still going past me in the street.        And does it not seem hard to you,      When all the sky is clear and blue,      And I should like so much to play,      To have to go to bed by day?
