THE PERSONAL SIDE                                    85          OPPORTUNITIES IN ENGINEERING          I    ENGINEERING AND THE ENGINEER      Several years ago, at the regular annual meeting of one of the major  engineering societies, the president of the society, in the formal  address with which he opened the meeting, gave expression to a thought  so startling that the few laymen who were seated in the auditorium  fairly gasped. What the president said in effect was that, since  engineers had got the world into war, it was the duty of engineers to  get the world out of war. As a thought, it probably reflected the secret  opinion of every engineer present, for, however innocent of intended  wrong-doing engineers assuredly are as a group in their work of  scientific investigation and development, the statement that engineers  were responsible for the conflict then raging in Europe was absolute  truth.    I mention this merely to bring to the reader's attention the tremendous  power which engineers wield in world affairs.    The profession of engineering--which, by the way, is merely the adapting  of discoveries in science and art to the uses of mankind--is a  peculiarly isolated one. But very little is known about it among those  outside of the profession. Laymen know something about law, a little  about medicine, quite a lot--nowadays--about metaphysics. But laymen  know nothing about engineering. Indeed, a source of common amusement  among engineers is the peculiar fact that the average layman cannot  differentiate between the man who runs a locomotive and the man who  designs a locomotive. In ordinary parlance both are called engineers.  Yet there is a difference between them--a difference as between day and  night. For one merely operates the results of the creative genius of the  other. This almost universal ignorance as to what constitutes an  engineer serves to show to what broad extent the profession of  engineering is isolated.    Yet it is a wonderful profession. I say this with due regard for all  other professions. For one cannot but ponder the fact that, if  engineers started the greatest war the world has ever known--and  engineers as a body freely admit that if they did not start it they at  least made it possible--they also stopped it, thereby proving themselves  possessed of a power greater than that of any other class of  professional men--diplomats and lawyers and divinities not excepted.    That engineering is a force fraught with stupendous possibilities,  therefore, nobody can very well deny. That it is a force generally  exercised for good--despite the World War--I myself, as an engineer, can  truly testify. With some fifteen years spent on the creative end of the  work--the drafting and designing end--I have yet to see, with but two or  three rare exceptions, the genius of engineers turned into any but noble  channels.    Thus, engineering is not only a wonderful profession, with the  activities of its followers of utmost importance, but also it is a  profession the individual work of whose pioneers, from Watt to  Westinghouse and from Eiffel to Edison, has been epoch-making.    For when James Watt, clock-repairer, tinker, being called into a certain  small laboratory in England more than a century ago to make a few minor  repairs on a new design of steam-engine, discovered, while at work on  this crude unit deriving its motion from expanded steam and the  alternate workings of a lever actuated by a weight, the value of  superheated steam for power purposes, and later embodied the idea in a  steam-engine of his own, Watt set the civilized world forward into an  era so full of promise and discovery that even we who are living to-day,  despite the wonderful progress already made in mechanics as represented  among other things in the high-speed engine, the dynamo, the airplane,  are witnessing but the barest of beginnings.    Likewise, when George Westinghouse, inventor of the airbrake, having  finally persuaded the directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad, after many  futile attempts in other directions, to grant him an opportunity to try  out his invention, and, trying it out--on a string of cars near  Harrisburg--ably demonstrated its practicability as a device for  stopping trains and preventing accidents, he also--as had Watt before  him--set the civilized world forward into an era full of promise and  discovery as yet but barely entered upon, even with the remarkable  progress already made in industry alone in the matter of regard for the  safety of human life--Westinghouse's own particular blazed trail through  the forest of human ignorance this same airbrake.    So with other pioneers--with Eiffel, in the field of tower construction;  with Edison, in the field of electricity; with the Wright brothers, in  the field of aerial navigation; With Simon Lake, inventor of the  submarine boat. All were pioneers; all set the civilized world forward;  all--though this perhaps is irrelevant, yet it will serve to reveal the  type of men these pioneers were and are--all overcame great  obstacles--Lake not the least among them.    Told that he was visionary, when Lake explained, as he did in his effort  to enlist capital with which to build his first submarine boat, that he  could safely submerge his invention and steer it about on the bed of the  ocean as readily as a man can steer an automobile about the streets of a  city, that while submerged he could step out of the boat through a  trap-door without flooding the boat, by the simple process of  maintaining a greater air pressure inside than the pressure of the water  outside--Simon Lake, discouraged on every hand, finally decided to build  a boat himself, and did build one, with his own hands--a boat fourteen  feet long and constructed of rough pine timbers painted with  coal-tar--in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. With this boat Lake  demonstrated to a skeptical world for all time that he was neither a  visionary nor a dreamer, but a practical doer among men--an engineer.    Of such stuff, then, were, and are, engineers made. Whether they  realized it or not, whether the world at large realized it or not, each  represented a noble calling, each was a professional man, each was  chiseling his name for all time into the granite foundations of a  wonderful profession even yet only in the building--engineering. Their  name is legion, too, and their names will last because of the fact that  their work, remaining as it does after them equally with the work of  followers of the finest of the fine arts, is known to mankind as a  benefit to mankind. Known by their works, the list extends back to the  very dawn of history.    For it was men of this calling, the calling of engineers, who in the  early days wrought for purposes of warfare--warfare then being the major  industry--the javelin, the spear, the helmet, the coat of mail, the  plate of armor, the slingshot; just as their later brothers, for a like  purpose, conceived and devised the throwing of mustard gas, the two-ton  explosive, the aerial bomb, the mortar shell, the hand-grenade--for the  protection, false and true, of the home. For the upbuilding of the home,  for the continuance of the home, men of this calling also it was who  conceived and shaped, among other things, the cook-stove, the chimney,  the wheel, the steam-engine, the spinning-jenny, the suspension-bridge,  the bedspring-oh, boy!--the bicycle, the sandblast, the automobile, the  airplane, the wireless.    Thus it will be seen that engineering is a distinctive and important  profession. To some even it is the topmost of all professions. However  true that may or may not be to-day, certain it is that some day it will  be true, for the reason that engineers serve humanity at every practical  turn. Engineers make life easier to live--easier in the living; their  work is strictly constructive, sharply exact; the results positive. Not  a profession outside of the engineering profession but that has its  moments of wabbling and indecision--of faltering on the part of  practitioners between the true and the untrue. Engineering knows no such  weakness. Two and two make four. Engineers know that.

Edited by Edmund Gosse          A History of  FRENCH LITERATURE      BY    EDWARD DOWDEN  D.LITT., LL.D. (DUB.), D.C.L. (OXON.), LL.D. (EDIN.)  LL.D. (PRINCETON)  PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF DUBLIN          London  WILLIAM HEINEMANN  MCMXIV          _First Edition_, 1897  _New Impressions_, 1899, 1904, 1907, 1911, 1914          _Copyright, London_ 1897, _by William Heinemann_          PREFACE      French prose and French poetry had interested me during so many years  that when Mr. Gosse invited me to write this book I knew that I was  qualified in one particular--the love of my subject. Qualified in  knowledge I was not, and could not be. No one can pretend to know  the whole of a vast literature. He may have opened many books and  turned many pages; he cannot have penetrated to the soul of all books  from the _Song of Roland_ to _Toute la Lyre_. Without reaching its  spirit, to read a book is little more than to amuse the eye with printed  type.    An adequate history of a great literature can be written only by  collaboration. Professor Petit de Julleville, in the excellent  _Histoire de la Langue et de la Litterature Francaise_, at present  in process of publication, has his well-instructed specialist for  each chapter. In this small volume I too, while constantly exercising  my own judgment, have had my collaborators--the ablest and most  learned students of French literature--who have written each a part  of my book, while somehow it seems that I have written the whole.  My collaborators are on my shelves. Without them I could not have  accomplished my task; here I give them credit for their assistance.  Some have written general histories of French literature; some have  written histories of periods--the Middle Ages, the sixteenth,  seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth centuries; some have studied  special literary fields or forms--the novel, the drama, tragedy,  comedy, lyrical poetry, history, philosophy; many have written  monographs on great authors; many have written short critical studies  of books or groups of books. I have accepted from each a gift. But  my assistants needed to be controlled; they brought me twenty thousand  pages, and that was too much. Some were accurate in statement of fact,  but lacked ideas; some had ideas, but disregarded accuracy of  statement; some unjustly depreciated the seventeenth century, some  the eighteenth. For my purposes their work had to be rewritten; and  so it happens that this book is mine as well as theirs.    The sketch of mediaeval literature follows the arrangement of matter  in the two large volumes of M. Petit de Julleville and his  fellow-labourers, to whom and to the writings of M. Gaston Paris I  am on almost every page indebted. Many matters in dispute have here  to be briefly stated in one way; there is no space for discussion.  Provencal literature does not appear in this volume. It is omitted  from the History of M. Petit de Julleville and from that of M. Lanson.  In truth, except as an influence, it forms no part of literature in  the French language.    The reader who desires guidance in bibliography will find it at the  close of each chapter of the History edited by M. Petit de Julleville,  less fully in the notes to M. Lanson's History, and an excellent table  of critical and biographical studies is appended to each volume of  M. Lintilhac's _Histoire de la Litterature Francaise_. M. Lintilhac,  however, omits many important English and German titles--among  others, if I am not mistaken, those of Birsch-Hirschfeld's  _Geschichte der Franzosichen Litteratur: die Zeit der Renaissance_,  of Lotheissen's important _Geschichte der Franzosichen Litteratur  im XVII. Jahrhundert_, and of Professor Flint's learned _Philosophy  of History_ (1893).    M. Lanson's work has been of great service in guiding me in the  arrangement of my subjects, and in giving me courage to omit many  names of the second or third rank which might be expected to appear  in a history of French literature. In a volume like the present,  selection is important, and I have erred more by inclusion than by  exclusion. The limitation of space has made me desire to say no word  that does not tend to bring out something essential or characteristic.    M. Lanson has ventured to trace French literature to the present  moment. I have thought it wiser to close my survey with the decline  of the romantic movement. With the rise of naturalism a new period  opens. The literature of recent years is rather a subject for current  criticism than for historical study.    I cannot say how often I have been indebted to the writings of M.  Brunetiere, M. Faguet, M. Larroumet, M. Paul Stapfer, and other living  critics: to each of the volumes of _Les Grands Ecrivains Francais_,  and to many of the volumes of the _Classiques Populaires_. M.  Lintilhac's edition of Merlet's _Etudes Litteraires_ has also often  served me. But to name my aids to study would be to fill some pages.    While not unmindful of historical and social influences, I desire  especially to fix my reader's attention on great individuals, their  ideas, their feelings, and their art. The general history of ideas  should, in the first instance, be discerned by the student of  literature through his observation of individual minds.    That errors must occur where so many statements are made, I am aware  from past experience; but I have taken no slight pains to attain  accuracy. It must not be hastily assumed that dates here recorded  are incorrect because they sometimes differ from those given in other  books. For my errors I must myself bear the responsibility; but by  the editorial care of Mr. Gosse, in reading the proof-sheets of this  book, the number of such errors has been reduced.

From the union of feudalism  and Christianity arose the chivalric ideals, the new courtesy, the  homage to woman. Abstract ideas, ethical, theological, and those of  amorous metaphysics, were rendered through allegory into art.  Against these high conceptions, and the overstrained sentiment  connected with them, the positive intellect and the mocking temper  of France reacted; a literature of satire arose. By degrees the  bourgeois spirit encroached upon and overpowered the chivalric  ideals. At length the mediaeval conceptions were exhausted.  Literature dwindled as its sources were impoverished; ingenuities  and technical formalities replaced imagination. The minds of men were  prepared to accept the new influences of the Renaissance and the  Reformation.      I  NARRATIVE RELIGIOUS POETRY    The oldest monument of the French language is found in the Strasburg  Oaths (842); the oldest French poem possessing literary merit is the  _Vie de Saint Alexis_, of which a redaction belonging to the middle  of the eleventh century survives. The passion of piety and the passion  of combat, the religious and the warrior motives, found early  expression in literature; from the first arose the Lives of Saints  and other devout writings, from the"]]]
