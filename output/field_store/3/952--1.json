INTRODUCTION      Dr. Moll is a gifted physician of long experience whose work with those  problems of medicine and hygiene which demand scientific acquaintance  with human nature has made him well known to experts in these fields. In  this book he has undertaken to describe the origin and development, in  childhood and youth, of the acts and feelings due to sex; to explain the  forces by which sex-responses are directed and misdirected; and to judge  the wisdom of existing and proposed methods of preventing the  degradation of a child's sexual life.    This difficult task is carried out, as it should be, with dignity and  frankness. In spite of the best intentions, a scientific book on  sex-psychology is likely to appear, at least in spots, to gratify a low  curiosity; but in Dr. Moll's book there is no such taint. Popular books  on sex-hygiene, on the other hand, are likely to suffer from a  pardonable but harmful delicacy whereby the facts of anatomy,  physiology, and psychology which are necessary to make their principles  comprehensible and useful, are omitted, veiled, or even distorted. Dr.  Moll honors his readers by a frankness which may seem brutal to some of  them. It is necessary.    With dignity and frankness Dr. Moll combines notable good sense. In the  case of any exciting movement in advance of traditional custom, the  forerunners are likely to combine a certain one-sidedness and lack of  balance with their really valuable progressive ideas. The greater  sagacity and critical power are more often found amongst the men of  science who avoid public discussion of exciting social or moral reforms,  and are suspicious of startling and revolutionary doctrines or  practices. It is therefore fortunate that a book on the sexual life  during childhood should have been written by a man of critical,  matter-of-fact mind, of long experience as a medical specialist, and of  wide scholarship, who has no private interest in any exciting  psychological doctrine or educational panacea.    The translation of this book will be welcomed by men and women from many  different professions, but alike in the need of preparation to guide the  sex-life of boys and girls and to meet emergencies caused by its  corruption by weakness within or attack from without. Of the clergymen  in this country who are in real touch with the lives of their charges,  there is hardly a one who does not, every so often, have to minister to  a mind whose moral and religious distress depends on an unfortunate sex  history. Conscientious and observant teachers realize, in a dim way,  that they cannot do justice to even the purely intellectual needs of  pupils without understanding the natural history of those instinctive  impulses, which, concealed and falsified as they are under our  traditional taboos, nevertheless retain enormous potency. The facts, so  clearly shown in the present volume, that the life of sex begins long  before its obvious manifestations at puberty, and that the direction of  its vaguer and less differentiated habits in these earlier years is as  important as its hygiene at the more noticeable climax of the early  'teens, increase the teacher's responsibility. Moreover, there is  probably not a teacher of ten years' standing who has not faced--or by  ignorance neglected--some emergency where moderate insight into the laws  whereby the vague instincts of sex are turned into healthy and unhealthy  habits, and form right and wrong attitudes, could have rescued a boy or  girl from years of wretched anxiety, or degraded conduct, or both.    The social worker, still more emphatically, knows his or her need of a  surer equipment for the wise direction of the life of sex in childhood  and its protection from the abominable suggestions of those who are  themselves sexually diseased or depraved. The casual questioning of  medical or legal friends, reminiscences of vague references in the Bible  or classic literature, and the miscellaneous experiences which life  itself throws in one's way, are hopelessly inadequate.    The conscientious practitioner of medicine, too, will gladly add to the  scanty, though accurate, knowledge of the sex-instinct and its pathology  which is all that even the best medical course can compass, the facts  presented by a specialist in this field. The easiest way for those  parents who accept the responsibility for rational guidance of their  children in matters of sex-behavior to discharge this responsibility is  by the aid of the family physician. For the physician in such cases to  gain the child's confidence, understand his individual dangers and  possible false attitudes, and give more than perfunctory general  counsel, knowledge of the psychology of sex-behavior, as well as its  physiology, is necessary. In general, also, modern medical practice must  look after the _prevention_ of bad habits and unnecessary anxieties in  respect to the sex-life as well as their cure; and the science of  preventive medicine in this field receives a substantial contribution  from this summary of the sex-life of childhood.    There are now many men and women who are dissatisfied with doing for  their children merely what outgrown customs decree, who are willing to  give time and study, as well as money and affection, in their service,  and who are eager to see or hear or read anything pertinent to their  welfare. For many such parents, if they are of the scientific,  matter-of-fact type, Dr. Moll's book may prove the means of answering  many troublesome questions and of prompting to a wiser cooperation with  church, school, and the medical profession in safeguarding their  own--and, we may hope, all other--children against blunders and  contaminations.    One word of caution is perhaps necessary for those readers who are  unused to descriptions of symptoms of diseases, abnormalities, and  defects. Such readers are likely to interpret perfectly ordinary facts  as the symptoms which they have been studying. So the medical student at  the beginning of his reading, fears appendicitis when he has slight  indigestion, and sees incipient tuberculosis in every household! So the  embryonic psychologist finds 'degenerates' in every crowd of boys,  'hypnotic suggestion' in every popular preacher, and 'aphasia' in any  friend who forgets names and faces! Dr. Moll gives more protection  against such exaggerated inferences than is commonly given in books on  pathology, but many of his readers will do well to be on their guard  lest they interpret perfectly innocent behavior as a symptom of  abnormality. The mischief done by our present ignorance and neglect of  important features of sex-behavior should be prevented without the  incidence of mischief from exaggerated expectations and unwise meddling.    It would be evasive to shirk mention of the fact that many of the most  devoted servants of health and morals object to public discussion of the  facts of sex. They discard enlightenment about sex as relatively  unimportant because a clean ancestry, decency in the family and  neighborhood, and noble needs in friendship, love, and marriage must, in  any case, be the main roots of healthy direction and ideal restraint of  the sex-instinct. Or they fear enlightenment as a possible stimulus to  undesirable imagination and experimentation. Or they dislike, even  abhor, it as esthetically repulsive--shocking to an unreasoned but  cherished craving for silence about these things--a craving which the  customs of our land and time have made an unwritten law of society.    Of the first of these three attitudes, it may be said briefly that the  relative unimportance of enlightenment is a fact, but no argument  against it. Modesty, austerity, and clean living on the part of parents  will counterbalance much negligence in direct guidance or protection.  But the former need be in no wise lessened by improving the latter. Of  the second, I dare affirm that if the men and women in America should  stop whatever they are doing for an evening and read this book, there  would be less harmful imagination as a result than from the occupations  which its reading would replace. Of all the causes of sexual disorder,  the reading of scientific books by reputable men is surely the least!  The third--that is, the esthetic--repulsion toward publicity in respect  to the natural history of sex, I will not pretend to judge. Only we must  not strain at gnats and swallow camels. It is no sign of true esthetic  or moral sensitiveness for a person to be shocked by 'Ghosts,' 'Mrs.  Warren's Profession,' or 'The Sexual Life of the Child,' who finds  pleasant diversion in the treatment of sex-behavior in the ordinary  novel, newspaper, or play.    On the whole, the gain from giving earnest men and women the facts they  need, seems likely to outweigh by much the harm done to such light minds  as will be misled, or to such sentimental minds as will be wounded, by  enlightenment about sex. No harm will be done to those men and women  whose interest in the welfare of children makes them eager to face every  problem that it involves, and whose faith in the ideal possibilities of  love between the sexes is too well-grounded to be disturbed by the facts  of its natural history.

Though conscious of his  inability to do justice to the sublimest of poets and the noblest of  sciences, the author has ventured to contribute to Miltonic literature a  work which he hopes will prove to be of an interesting and instructive  character. Perhaps the choicest passages in the poem are associated with  astronomical allusion, and it is chiefly to the exposition and  illustration of these that this volume is devoted.    The writer is indebted to many authors for information and reference,  and especially to Miss Agnes M. Clerke, Professors Masson and Young, Mr.  James Nasmyth, Mr. G. F. Chambers, and Sir Robert Ball. Also to the  works of the late Mr. R. A. Proctor, Sirs W. and J. Herschel, Admiral  Smyth, Professor Grant, Mr. J. R. Hind, Sir David Brewster, Rev. A. B.  Whatton, and Prebendary Webb.    Most of the illustrations have been supplied by the Publishers: Messrs.  Macmillan and W.

CHAPTER I    A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY      Astronomy is the oldest and most sublime of all the sciences. To a  contemplative observer of the heavens, the number and brilliancy of the  stars, the lustre of the planets, the silvery aspect of the Moon, with  her ever-changing phases, together with the order, the harmony, and  unison pervading them all, create in his mind thoughts of wonder and  admiration. Occupying the abyss of space indistinguishable from  infinity, the starry heavens in grandeur and magnificence surpass the  loftiest conceptions of the human mind; for, at a distance beyond the  range of ordinary vision, the telescope reveals clusters, systems,  galaxies, universes of stars--suns--the innumerable host of heaven, each  shining with a splendour comparable with that of our Sun, and, in all  likelihood, fulfilling in a similar manner the same beneficent purposes.    The time when man began to study the stars is lost in the antiquity of  prehistoric ages. The ancient inhabitants of the Earth regarded the  heavenly bodies with veneration and awe, erected temples in their  honour, and worshipped them as deities. Historical records of astronomy  carry us back several thousand years. During the greater part of this  time, and until a comparatively recent period, astronomy was associated  with astrology--a science which originated from a desire on the part of  mankind to penetrate the future, and which was based upon the supposed  influence of the heavenly bodies upon human and terrestrial affairs. It  was natural to imagine that the overruling power which governed and  directed the course of sublunary events resided in the heavens, and that  its decrees might be understood by watching the movements of the  heavenly bodies under its control. It was, therefore, believed that by  observing the configuration of the planets and the positions of the  constellations at the instant of the birth of an individual, his  horoscope, or destiny, could be foretold; and that by making  observations of a somewhat similar nature the occurrence of events of  public importance could be predicted. When, however, the laws which  govern the motions of the heavenly bodies became better known, and  especially after the discovery of the great law of gravitation,  astrology ceased to be a belief, though for long after it retained its  power over the imagination, and was often alluded to in the writings of  poets and other authors.    In the early dawn of astronomical science, the theories upheld with  regard to the structure of the heavens were of a simple and primitive  nature, and might even be described as grotesque. This need occasion no  surprise when we consider the difficulties with which ancient  astronomers had to contend in their endeavours to reduce to order and  harmony the complicated motions of the orbs which they beheld circling  around them.    The grouping of the stars into constellations having fanciful names,  derived from fable or ancient mythology, occurred at a very early  period, and though devoid of any methodical arrangement, is yet  sufficiently well-defined to serve the purposes of modern astronomers.  Several of the ancient nations of the earth, including the Chaldeans,  Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese, claim to have been the earliest  astronomers. Chinese records of astronomy reveal an antiquity of near  3,000 years B.C., but they contain no evidence that their authors  possessed any scientific knowledge, and they merely record the  occurrence of solar eclipses and the appearances of comets.    It is not known when astronomy was first studied by the Egyptians; but  what astronomical information they have handed down is not of a very  intelligible kind, nor have they left behind any data that can be relied  upon. The Great Pyramid, judging from the exactness with which it faces  the cardinal points, must have been designed by persons who possessed a  good knowledge of astronomy, and it was probably made use of for  observational purposes.    It is now generally admitted that correct astronomical observations were  first made on the plains of Chaldea, records of eclipses having been  discovered in Chaldean cities which date back 2,234 years B.C. The  Chaldeans were true astronomers: they made correct observations of the  risings and settings of the heavenly bodies; and the exact orientation  of their temples and public buildings indicates the precision with which  they observed the positions of celestial objects. They invented the  zodiac and gnomon, made use of several kinds of dials, notified  eclipses, and divided the day into twenty-four hours.    To the Greeks belongs the credit of having first studied astronomy in a  regular and systematic manner. THALES (640 B.C.) was one of the earliest  of Greek astronomers, and may be regarded as the founder of the science  among that people. He was born at Miletus, and afterwards repaired to  Egypt for the purpose of study. On his return to Greece he founded the  Ionian school, and taught the sphericity of the Earth, the obliquity of  the ecliptic, and the true causes of eclipses of the Sun and Moon. He  also directed the attention of mariners to the superiority of the Lesser  Bear, as a guide for the navigation of vessels, as compared with"]]]
