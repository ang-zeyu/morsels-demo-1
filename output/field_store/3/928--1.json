CONTAINING    A CATALOGUE OF DISEASES    DISTRIBUTED INTO    NATURAL CLASSES ACCORDING TO THEIR PROXIMATE CAUSES,    WITH THEIR    SUBSEQUENT ORDERS, GENERA, AND SPECIES,    AND WITH    THEIR METHODS OF CURE.           *       *       *       *       *        Haec, ut potero, explicabo; nec tamen, quasi Pythius Apollo, certa ut      sint et fixa, quae dixero; sed ut Homunculus unus e multis probabiliora      conjectura sequens.--CIC. TUSC. DISP. l. 1. 9.           *       *       *       *       *    PREFACE.    All diseases originate in the exuberance, deficiency, or retrograde action,  of the faculties of the sensorium, as their proximate cause; and consist in  the disordered motions of the fibres of the body, as the proximate effect  of the exertions of those disordered faculties.    The sensorium possesses four distinct powers, or faculties, which are  occasionally exerted, and produce all the motions of the fibrous parts of  the body; these are the faculties of producing fibrous motions in  consequence of irritation which is excited by external bodies; in  consequence of sensation which is excited by pleasure or pain; in  consequence of volition which is excited by desire or aversion; and in  consequence of association which is excited by other fibrous motions. We  are hence supplied with four natural classes of diseases derived from their  proximate causes; which we shall term those of irritation, those of  sensation, those of volition, and those of association.    In the subsequent classification of diseases I have not adhered to the  methods of any of those, who have preceded me; the principal of whom are  the great names of Sauvages and Cullen; but have nevertheless availed  myself, as much as I could, of their definitions and distinctions.    The essential characteristic of a disease consists in its proximate cause,  as is well observed by Doctor Cullen, in his Nosologia Methodica, T. ii.  Prolegom. p. xxix. Similitudo quidem morborum in similitudine causae eorum  proximae, qualiscunque sit, revera consistit. I have taken the proximate  cause for the classic character. The characters of the orders are taken  from the excess, or deficiency, or retrograde action, or other properties  of the proximate cause. The genus is generally derived from the proximate  effect. And the species generally from the locality of the disease in the  system.    Many species in this system are termed genera in the systems of other  writers; and the species of those writers are in consequence here termed  varieties. Thus in Dr. Cullen's Nosologia the variola or small-pox is  termed a genus, and the distinct and confluent kinds are termed species.  But as the infection from the distinct kind frequently produces the  confluent kind, and that of the confluent kind frequently produces the  distinct; it would seem more analogous to botanical arrangement, which  these nosologists profess to imitate, to call the distinct and confluent  small-pox varieties than species. Because the species of plants in  botanical systems propagate others similar to themselves; which does not  uniformly occur in such vegetable productions as are termed varieties.    In some other genera of nosologists the species have no analogy to each  other, either in respect to their proximate cause, or to their proximate  effect, though they may he somewhat similar in less essential properties;  thus the thin and saline discharge from the nostrils on going into the cold  air of a frosty morning, which is owing to the deficient action of the  absorbent vessels of the nostrils, is one species; and the viscid mucus  discharged from the secerning vessels of the same membrane, when inflamed,  is another species of the same genus, Catarrhus. Which bear no analogy  either in respect to their immediate cause or to their immediate effect.    The uses of the method here offered to the public of classing diseases  according to their proximate causes are, first, more distinctly to  understand their nature by comparing their essential properties. Secondly,  to facilitate the knowledge of the methods of cure; since in natural  classification of diseases the species of each genus, and indeed the genera  of each order, a few perhaps excepted, require the same general medical  treatment. And lastly, to discover the nature and the name of any disease  previously unknown to the physician; which I am persuaded will be more  readily and more certainly done by this natural system, than by the  artificial classifications already published.    The common names of diseases are not well adapted to any kind of  classification, and least of all to this from their proximate causes. Some  of their names in common language are taken from the remote cause, as  worms, stone of the bladder; others from the remote effect, as diarrhoea,  salivation, hydrocephalus; others from some accidental symptom of the  disease, as tooth-ach, head-ach, heart-burn; in which the pain is only a  concomitant circumstance of the excess or deficiency of fibrous actions,  and not the cause of them. Others again are taken from the deformity  occasioned in consequence of the unnatural fibrous motions, which  constitute diseases, as tumours, eruptions, extenuations; all these  therefore improperly give names to diseases; and some difficulty is thus  occasioned to the reader in endeavouring to discover to what class such  disorders belong.    Another difficulty attending the names of diseases is, that one name  frequently includes more than one disease, either existing at the same time  or in succession. Thus the pain of the bowels from worms is caused by the  increased action of the membrane from the stimulus of those animals; but  the convulsions, which sometimes succeed these pains in children, are  caused by the consequent volition, and belong to another class.    To discover under what class any disease should be arranged, we must first  investigate the proximate cause; thus the pain of the tooth-ach is not the  cause of any diseased motions, but the effect; the tooth-ach therefore does  not belong to the class of Sensation. As the pain is caused by increased or  decreased action of the membranes of the tooth, and these actions are owing  to the increase or decrease of irritation, the disease is to be placed in  the class of irritation.    To discover the order it must be inquired, whether the pain be owing to  increased or defective motion of the pained membrane; which is known by the  concomitant heat or coldness of the part. In tooth-ach without inflammation  there is generally a coldness attends the cheek in its vicinity; as may be  perceived by the hand of the patient himself, compared with the opposite  cheek. Hence odontalgia is found to belong to the order of decreased  irritation. The genus and species must be found by inspecting the synopsis  of the second order of the class of Irritation. See Class I. 2. 4. 12.    This may be further elucidated by considering the natural operation of  parturition; the pain is occasioned by the increased action or distention  of the vessels of the uterus, in consequence of the stimulus of the fetus;  and is therefore caused by increased irritation; but the action of the  abdominal muscles in its exclusion are caused by the pain, and belong to  the class of increased sensation. See Class II. 1. 1. 12. Hence the  difficulty of determining, under what class of diseases parturition should  be arranged, consists in there being two kinds of diseased actions  comprehended under one word; which have each their different proximate  cause.    In Sect. XXXIX. 8. 4. and in Class II. 1. 1. 1. we have endeavoured to give  names to four links of animal causation, which conveniently apply to the  classification of diseases; thus in common nictitation, or winking with the  eyes without our attention to it, the increased irritation is the proximate  cause; the stimulus of the air on the dry cornea is the remote cause; the  closing of the eyelid is the proximate effect; and the diffusion of tears  over the eye-ball is the remote effect. In some cases two more links of  causation may be introduced; one of them may be termed the pre-remote  cause; as the warmth or motion of the atmosphere, which causes greater  exhalation from the cornea. And the other the post-remote effect; as the  renewed pellucidity of the cornea; and thus six links of causation may be  expressed in words.    But if amid these remote links of animal causation any of the four powers  or faculties of the sensorium be introduced, the reasoning is not just  according to the method here proposed; for these powers of the sensorium  are always the proximate causes of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27609"],[0,"The Undersea Tube (#1)"],[1,"Undersea Tube    BY L. TAYLOR HANSEN      Classic Reprint from AMAZING STORIES, Nov., 1929    Copyright, 1929, by E. P. Incorporated      [Illustration]      If my friend the engineer had not told me the Tube was dangerous, I  would not have bought a ticket on that fatal night, and the world would  never have learned the story of the Golden Cavern and the City of the  Dead. Having therefore, according to universal custom, first made my  report as the sole survivor of the much-discussed Undersea Tube disaster  to the International Committee for the Investigation of Disasters, I am  now ready to outline that story for the world. Naturally I am aware of  the many wild tales and rumors that have been circulated ever since the  accident, but I must ask my readers to bear with me while I attempt to  briefly sketch, not only the tremendous difficulties to be overcome by  the engineers, but also the wind-propulsion theory which was made use of  in this undertaking; because it is only by understanding something of  these two phases of the Tube's engineering problems that one can  understand the accident and its subsequent revelations.    It will be recalled by those who have not allowed their view of modern  history to become too hazy, that the close of the twentieth century saw  a dream of the engineering world at last realized--the completion of the  long-heralded undersea railroad. It will also be recalled that the  engineers in charge of this stupendous undertaking were greatly  encouraged by the signal success of the first tube under the English  Channel, joining England and France by rail. However, it was from the  second tube across the Channel and the tube connecting Montreal to New  York, as well as the one connecting New York and Chicago, that they  obtained some of their then radical ideas concerning the use of wind  power for propulsion. Therefore, before the Undersea Tube had been  completed, the engineers in charge had decided to make use of the new  method in the world's longest tunnel, and upon that decision work was  immediately commenced upon the blue-prints for the great air pumps that  were to rise at the two ends--Liverpool and New York. However, I will  touch upon the theory of wind-propulsion later and after the manner in  which it was explained to me.    It will be recalled that after great ceremonies, the Tube was begun  simultaneously at the two terminating cities and proceeded through solid  rock--low enough below the ocean floor to overcome the terrible pressure  of the body of water over it, and yet close enough to the sea to  overcome the intensity of subterranean heat. Needless to say, it was an  extremely hazardous undertaking, despite the very careful surveys that  had been made, for the little parties of workmen could never tell when  they would strike a crack or an unexpected crevice that would let down  upon them with a terrible rush, the waters of the Atlantic. But hazard  is adventure, and as the two little groups of laborers dug toward each  other, the eyes of the press followed them with more persistent interest  than it has ever followed the daily toil of any man or group of men,  either before or since.           *       *       *       *       *    Once the world was startled by the \"extree-ee--\" announcing that the  English group had broken into an extinct volcano, whose upper end had  apparently been sealed ages before, for it contained not water but  air--curiously close and choking perhaps, but at least it was not the  watery deluge of death. And then came the great discovery. No one who  lived through that time will forget the thrill that quickened the pulse  of mankind when the American group digging through a seam of old lava  under what scientists call the \"ancient ridge,\" broke into a sealed  cavern which gleamed in the probing flashlights of the workers like the  scintillating points of a thousand diamonds. But when they found the  jeweled casket, through whose glass top they peered curiously down upon  the white body of a beautiful woman, partly draped in the ripples of her  heavy, red hair, the world gasped and wondered. As every school child  knows, the casket was opened by curious scientists, who flocked into the  tube from the length of the world, but at the first exposure to the air,  the strange liquid that had protected the body vanished, leaving in the  casket not the white figure, but only a crumbling mass of grey dust. But  the questions that the finding of the cave had raised remained  unanswered.    [Illustration]    Who was this woman? How did she get into the sealed cavern? If she had  been the court favorite of that mythical kingdom, now sunk beneath the  waves, and had been disposed of in court intrigue, why would her  murderers have buried her in such a casket? How had she been killed? An  unknown poison? Perhaps she had been a favorite slave of the monarch.  This view gained many converts among the archaeologists who argued that  from all the evidence we have available, the race carrying the Iberian  or Proto-Egyptian culture, long thought to have been the true refugees  from sinking Atlantis, were a slight dark-haired race. Therefore this  woman must have been a captive. Geologists, analyzing the lava,  announced that it had hardened in air and not in water, while  anthropologists classed the skull of the woman as essentially more  modern than either the Neanderthal or Cro-Magnon types. But the  engineers, secretly fuming at the delay, finally managed to fill up the  cave and press on with their drills.    Then following the arguments that still flourished in the press, came a  tiny little news article and the first message to carry concern to the  hearts of the engineers. The sea had begun to trickle in through one  slight crack. Perhaps it was only because the crevice was located on the  English side of the now famous \"ancient ridge\" that the article brought  forth any notice at all. But for the engineers it meant the first  warning of possibly ultimate disaster. They could not seal the crack,  and pumps were brought into play. However, as a month wore on, the crack  did not appear to widen to any material extent and the danger cry of a  few pessimists was forgotten.    Finally, it will be remembered, that sounders listening in the rocks  heard the drillers of the other party, and then with wild enthusiasm the  work was pushed on to completion. The long Tube had been dug. Now it  only remained for the sides at the junction to be enlarged and encased  with cast iron, while the work of setting up the great machines designed  to drive the pellet trains through, was also pushed on to its ultimate  end. Man had essayed the greatest feat of engineering ever undertaken in  the history of the planet, and had won. A period of wild celebration  greeted the first human beings to cross each direction below the sea.    Did the volume of water increase that was carried daily out of the Tube  and dumped from the two stations? If it did, the incident was ignored by  the press. Instead, the fact that some \"cranks\" persisted in calling  man's latest toy unsafe, only attracted more travel. The Undersea Tube  functioned on regular schedule for three years, became the usual method  of ocean transit.           *       *       *       *       *    This was the state of matters, when on the fourth of March last, our  textile company ordered me to France to straighten out some orders with  the France house, the situation being such that they preferred to send a  man. Why they did not use radio-vision I do not care to state, as this  is my company's business.    Therefore, upon entering my apartment, I was in the midst of packing  when the television phone called me. The jovial features of \"Dutch\"  Higgins, my one-time college room-mate and now one of the much-maligned  engineers of the Undersea Tube, smiled back at me from the disk.    \"Where are you? I thought we had a sort of dinner engagement at my  apartment, Bob.\"    \"By gollies I forgot, Dutch. I'll be right over--before it gets cold.\"    Then immediately I turned the knob to the Municipal Aerial-car yards,  and ordered my motor, as I grabbed my hat and hurried to the roof. In  due time, of course, I sprang the big surprise of the evening, adding:    \"And, of course, I'm going by the Tube, I feel sort of a  half-partnership in it because you were one of the designers.\"    A curious half-pained look crossed his face. We had finished our meal,  and were smoking with pushed-back chairs. He finished filling his pipe,  and scowled.    \"Well? Why don't you say something? Thought you'd be--well, sort of  pleased.\"    He struck his automatic lighter and drew in a long puff of smoke before  answering.    \"Wish you'd take another route, Bob.\"    \"Take another route?\"    \"Yes. If you want it straight, the Tube is not safe.\"    \"You are joking.\"    But as I looked into his cold, thoughtful blue eyes, I knew he had never  been more serious.    \"I wish that you would go by the Trans-Atlantic Air Liners. They are  just as fast.\"    \"But you used to be so enthusiastic about the Tube, Dutch! Why I  remember when it was being drilled that you would call me up at all  kinds of wild hours to tell me the latest bits of news.\"    He nodded slowly.    \"Yes, that was in the days before the crack.\"    \"Yet you expected to take care of possible leaks, you know,\" I  countered.    \"But this crack opened after the tunnel had been dug past it, and lately  it has opened more.\"    \"Are the other engineers alarmed?\"    \"No. We are easily taking care of the extra water and again the opening  seems to remain at a stationary width as it has for the past three  years. But we cannot caulk it.\"    \"Are you going to publish these views?\"    \"No. I made out a minority report. I can do no more.\"    \"Dutch, you are becoming over-cautious. First sign of old age.\"    \"Perhaps,\" with the old smile.    \"But after all it is now more than three years since "]]]
