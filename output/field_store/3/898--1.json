BASIL WORSFOLD      WITH PORTRAITS AND MAP               \"What would have been the position to-day in South Africa if       there had not been a man prepared to take upon himself       responsibility; a man whom difficulties could not conquer, whom       disasters could not cow, and whom obloquy could never       move?\"--LORD GOSCHEN _in the House of Lords, March 29th, 1906_            LONDON    JOHN MURRAY ALBEMARLE STREET W    1906      _This Edition enjoys copyright in all countries signatory to the Berne  Convention, as well as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and all British  Colonies and Dependencies._      _Printed by Hazell, Watson & Viney, Ld., London and Aylesbury._          PREFACE      In sending this book to press I have only two remarks to make by way  of preface.    The first is wholly personal. It has been my good fortune to reside  twice for a considerable period in South Africa--first in the  neighbourhood of Capetown (1883-5), and afterwards in Johannesburg  (1904-5). During these periods of residence, and also during the long  interval between them, I have been brought into personal contact with  many of the principal actors in the events which are related in this  book. While, therefore, no pains have been spared to secure accuracy  by a careful study of official papers and other reliable publications,  my information is not derived by any means exclusively from these  sources.    My second remark is the expression of a hope that the contents of this  book may be regarded not merely as a chapter of history, but also as a  body of facts essential to the full understanding of the circumstances  and conditions of South Africa, as it is to-day. Since the restoration  of peace--an event not yet five years old--a great change has been  wrought in the political and economic framework of this province of  the empire. None the less, with a few conspicuous exceptions, almost  all of the principal actors in these pages are still there; and,  presumably, they are very much the same men now as they were before,  and during, the war. And in this connection it remains to notice an  aspect of the South African struggle which transcends all others in  fruitfulness and importance. It was a struggle to keep South Africa  not a dependency of Great Britain, but a part of the empire. The  over-sea Britains, understanding it in this sense, took their share in  it. They made their voices heard in the settlement. The service which  they thus collectively performed was great. It would have been  infinitely greater if they had been directly represented in an  administration nominally common to them and the mother country. No  political system can be endowed with effective unity--with that  organic unity which is the only effective unity--unless it is  possessed of a single vehicle of thought and action. To create this  vehicle--an administrative body in which all parts of the empire would  be duly represented--is difficult to-day. The forces of disunion,  which are at work both at home and beyond the seas, may make it  impossible to-morrow.                                       W. B. W.

If success could  be won in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in India and in Egypt,  why failure in South Africa? For failure it was. A century of wars,  missionary effort, British expansion, industrial development, of lofty  administrative ideals and great men sacrificed, had left the two  European races with political ambitions so antagonistic, and social  differences so bitter, that nothing less than the combined military  resources of the colonies and the mother-country sufficed to compel  the Dutch to recognise the British principle of \"equal rights for all  white men south of the Zambesi.\" Among the many contributory causes of  failure that can be distinguished, the two most prominent are the  nationality difficulty and the native question. But these are problems  of administration that have been solved elsewhere: the former in  Canada and the latter in India. Or, to turn to agencies of a  different order, is the cause of failure to be found in a grudging  nature--the existence of physical conditions that made it difficult  for the white man, or for the white and coloured man together, to  wring a livelihood from the soil? The answer is that the like material  disadvantages have been conquered in Australia, India, and in Egypt,  by Anglo-Saxon energy. We might apply the Socratic method throughout,  traversing the entire range of our distinguishable causes; but in  every case the inquiry would reveal success in some other portion of  the Anglo-Saxon domain to darken failure in South Africa.    Nevertheless, in so far as any single influence can be assigned to  render intelligible a result brought about by many agencies, various  in themselves and operating from time to time in varying degrees, the  explanation is to be found in a little incident that happened in the  second year of the Dutch East India Company's settlement at the Cape  of Good Hope. The facts are preserved for us by the diary which  Commander Van Riebeck was ordered to keep for the information of his  employers. Under the date October 19th, 1653, we read that David  Janssen, a herdsman, was found lying dead of assegai wounds, inflicted  by the Beechranger Hottentots, while the cattle placed under his  charge were seen disappearing round the curve of the Lion's Head. The  theft had been successfully accomplished through the perfidy of a  certain \"Harry,\" a Hottentot chief, who was living on terms of  friendship with the Dutch--a circumstance which was sufficiently  apparent from the fact that the raid was timed to take place at an  hour on Sunday morning when the whole of the little community, with  the exception of two sentinels and a second herdsman, were assembled  to hear a sermon from the \"Sick-Comforter,\" Wylant. It was the first  conflict between the Dutch and the natives; for Van Riebeck had been  bidden, for various excellent reasons, to keep on good terms with the  Hottentots, and to treat them kindly. But the murder of a white man  was a serious matter. Kindness scarcely seemed to meet the case; and  so Van Riebeck applied to the Directors, the famous Chamber of  Seventeen, for definite instructions as to the course which he must  pursue.    [Sidenote: Van Riebeck's difficulty.]    He was told that only the actual murderer of David Janssen (if  apprehended) was to be put to death; that cattle equal in amount to  the cattle stolen were to be recovered, but only from the actual  robbers; and that \"Harry,\" if necessary, should be sent to prison at  Batavia. But he was not otherwise to molest or injure the offending  Hottentots. Excellent advice, and such as we should expect from the  countrymen of Grotius in their most prosperous era. But unfortunately  it was quite impossible for Van Riebeck, with his handful of soldiers  and sailors, planted at the extremity of the great barbaric continent  of Africa, to think of putting it into effect. He replied that he had  no means of identifying the individual wrong-doers, and that the  institution of private property was unknown among the Hottentots. The  only method by which the individual could be punished was by punishing  the tribe, and he therefore proposed to capture the tribe and their  cattle. But this was a course of action which was repugnant to the  Directors' sense of justice. It aroused, besides, a vision of  reinforcements ordered from Batavia, and of disbursements quite  disproportionate to the practical utility of the Cape station as an  item in the system of the Company. In vain Van Riebeck urged that a  large body of slaves and ten or twelve hundred head of cattle would be  a great addition to the resources of the settlement.

ANECDOTES  OF  DOGS.    BY    EDWARD JESSE, ESQ.      \"Histories are more full of examples of  the fidelity of dogs than of friends.\"                                        POPE.      With numerous Engravings.      LONDON:  HENRY G. BOHN, YORK STREET, COVENT GARDEN.  MDCCCLVIII.          LONDON:  Printed by G. Barclay, Castle St. Leicester Sq.          PREFACE.      The character, sensibilities, and intellectual faculties of animals  have always been a favourite study, and they are, perhaps, more  strongly developed in the dog than in any other quadruped, from the  circumstance of his being the constant companion of man. I am aware  how much has been written on this subject, but having accumulated many  original and interesting anecdotes of this faithful animal, I have  attempted to enlarge the general stock of information respecting it.  It is a pleasing task, arising from the conviction that the more the  character of the dog is known, the better his treatment is likely to  be, and the stronger the sympathy excited in his behalf.    Let me hope, that the examples which are given in the following pages  will help to produce this effect, and that a friend so faithful, a  protector so disinterested and courageous, will meet with that  kindness and affection he so well deserves.    It is now my grateful duty to express my thanks to those friends who  have so kindly contributed original anecdotes to this work, and  especially to Lady Morgan and Mrs. S. Carter Hall for their remarks on  the Irish wolf-dog.    I have also to acknowledge my obligations for various anecdotes  illustrative of the character of peculiar dogs, extracted from Colonel  Hamilton Smith's volumes in the Naturalist's Library and Captain  Brown's interesting sketches; as well to the Editor of the \"Irish  Penny Magazine\" for his extremely well-written account of the Irish  wolf-dog; and to other sources too numerous to mention.    The present new edition is considerably enlarged, both in matter and  plates, and, to suit the taste of the age is presented in a cheap and  popular form.    My Publisher has, as usual, lent his aid, and is responsible for some  of the additional anecdotes, for the account of the _Setter_, and for  all after page 458, including the chapter \"On Feeding and Management.\"    EDWARD JESSE.    _East Sheen, Sept. 1858._          ENGRAVINGS ON WOOD.
