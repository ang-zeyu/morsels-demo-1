[Illustration: Publisher's Logo]      PHILADELPHIA    GEORGE W. JACOBS & CO    PUBLISHERS      Copyright, 1902, by    George W. Jacobs & Company,    _Published September, 1902_          JANUARY.      1.--Stewed Breast of Lamb.    Cut a breast of lamb into small pieces, season, and stew until tender in  enough gravy to cover the meat. Thicken the sauce, flavor with a  wine-glass of wine, pile in the centre of a platter and garnish with  green peas.      2.--Chicken Creams.    Chop and pound 1/2 a lb. of chicken and 3 ozs. of ham; pass this through  a sieve, add 1 oz. of melted butter, 2 well-beaten eggs, and 1/2 a pint  of cream, which must be whipped; season with pepper and salt. Mix all  lightly together, put into oiled moulds and steam fifteen minutes, or if  in one large mould half an hour.      3.--Herring's Roes on Toast.    Have rounds of toast buttered and seasoned with salt and pepper, on each  piece place 1/2 the soft roe of a herring which has been slightly fried  and on the top of this a fried mushroom. Serve very hot.      4.--French Omelet.    For a very small omelet beat 2 whole eggs and the yokes of two more  until a full spoonful can be taken up. Add 3 tablespoonfuls of water,  1/4 of a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of pepper, and when well mixed  turn into a hot omelet pan, in which a tablespoonful of butter has been  melted, lift the edges up carefully and let the uncooked part run under.  When all is cooked garnish with parsley.      5.--Cheese Ramequins.    Melt 1 oz. of butter, mix with 1/2 oz. of flour, add 1/4 of a pint of  milk, stir and cook well. Then beat in the yolks of two eggs, sprinkle  in 3 ozs. of grated cheese, add the well-beaten whites of three eggs.  Mix in lightly and put in cases. Bake a quarter of an hour.      6.--Scotch Collops.    Cut cold roast veal into thin slices, and dust over them a little mace,  nutmeg, cayenne, and salt, and fry them in a little butter. Lay on a  dish and make a gravy by adding 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1/4 of a pint  of water, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 tablespoonful of lemon  juice, 1/4 of a teaspoonful of lemon peel, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream,  and 1 of sherry. Let boil up once and pour over the meat. Garnish with  lemon and parsley.      7.--Orange Salad.    Slice 3 sweet oranges, after removing the skin and pith, make a dressing  with 3 tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and  a pinch of salt. Serve on lettuce leaves.      8.--Oyster Potpie.    Scald one quart of oysters in their own liquor. When boiling take out  the oysters and keep them hot. Stir together a tablespoonful of butter  and two of flour, and moisten with cold milk. Add two small cups of  boiling water to the oyster liquor, season with salt and pepper, and  stir in the flour mixture, and let it cook until it thickens like cream.  Make a light biscuit dough and cut out with a thimble. Drop these into  the boiling mixture, cover the saucepan and cook until the dough is  done. Put the oysters on a hot dish and pour biscuit balls and sauce  over them.      9.--Chicken Cutlets.    Chop cold chicken fine; season with onion-juice, celery salt, pepper,  and chopped parsley. For 2 cupfuls allow a cupful of cream or rich milk.  Heat this (with a bit of soda stirred in) in a saucepan, and thicken  with a tablespoonful of butter rubbed in, one of corn-starch, stirred in  when the cream is scalding. Cook one minute, put in the seasoned  chicken, and cook until smoking hot. Beat two eggs light; take the  boiling mixture from the fire and add gradually to these. Pour into a  broad dish or agate-iron pan and set in a cold place until perfectly  chilled and stiff. Shape with your hands, or with a cutter, into the  form of cutlets or chops. Dip in egg, then in cracker-crumbs. Set on the  ice an hour or two and fry in deep boiling fat. Send around white sauce  with them.--From \"The National Cook Book,\" by Marion Harland and  Christine Terhune Herrick.      10.--Cocoanut Ice Cream.    Put 1 pint of milk over the fire in a double boiler with the grated  yellow rind of a lemon and three well-beaten eggs. Stir until the  mixture begins to thicken. Remove from the fire; add a cup and a half of  sugar, and 1 qt. of cream. Then add a grated cocoanut. Stir until the  custard is cold, add the lemon juice and freeze.      11.--Loaf Corn Bread.    Mix together 2 cupfuls of corn-meal, 1 cupful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of  salt, and 2 of baking powder. Beat together 3 eggs until thick and  light. Add 2-1/2 cupfuls of milk and stir into the dry mixture, adding 2  tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and  beating well until the batter is smooth. Grease the pans well, or it  will stick. Have the batter a little more than 2 inches deep in the pans  and bake in a hot oven for about half an hour.--\"Table Talk,\" Phila.      12.--Beef Ragout.    Cut cold roast beef into large slices. Put it into a saucepan with 2  slices of onion, salt and pepper. Pour over it 1/2 a pt. of boiling  water and add 3 tablespoonfuls of soup stock. Stew gently until cooked.      13.--Curried Rice.    Boil 1 cup of rice rapidly for half an hour, drain in a colander and  stand in the oven for a few minutes to dry out the rice. Put 2  tablespoonfuls of butter and a slice of onion into a saucepan. Stir  until the onion is a golden brown, add a tablespoonful of flour. (Take  out the slice of onion.) Stir until smooth, then add a teaspoonful of  curry powder, bring to a boil, add salt. Pour over the rice and serve  hot.      14.--Tapioca Soup.    One qt. of veal or chicken broth, 1 pt. of cream or milk, 1 onion, a  little celery, 1/3 of a cupful of tapioca, 2 cupfuls of cold water, 1  tablespoonful of butter, a small piece of mace, salt and pepper. Wash  and soak the tapioca over night. Cook it in the broth for an hour. Cook  milk, onion, mace and celery together for 15 minutes, then strain into  the tapioca and broth; add the butter, salt and pepper.      15.--Haddock Roes and Bacon.    Haddock roes are much cheaper than shad roes, and are very nice prepared  in this way. Soak for an hour in water and lemon juice, then parboil in  salt and water for ten minutes. Fry brown in a little lard and butter  mixed. Fry the bacon in a separate pan until brown, remove from the pan  and put it in the oven for a few minutes to crisp it. Put the roes in  the centre of a hot platter and garnish the bacon around it.      16.--Rice Moulds.    Wash a teacupful of rice in several waters, put it into a saucepan and  just cover with cold water, and when it boils, add two cupfuls of milk,  and boil until it becomes dry; put it into a mould and press it well.  When cold serve with a garnish of preserves around it or with a boiled  custard.      17.--English Muffins.    Scald 1 pt. of milk and add 1 oz. of butter and let cool; when cool add  1/4 of a yeast cake, a teaspoonful of salt and three cups of flour, beat  well, cover and let rise about two hours. When light, add sufficient  flour to make a soft dough; work lightly and divide into small balls;  put each one into a well-greased muffin ring and let rise again. Then  bake on a hot griddle. When ready to eat tear them open and butter.      18.--Minced Veal and Macaroni.    Mince 3/4 of a lb. of cold veal and 3 ozs. of ham, wet with 1  tablespoonful of gravy. Season with salt and pepper, a little nutmeg, a  quarter of a lb. of bread crumbs and a well-beaten egg. Butter a mould  and line it with some boiled macaroni. Mix more macaroni with the veal  mixture, fill the mould, put a plate on it and steam for 1/2 an hour.  Turn out carefully, pour a good brown gravy _around_ it.      19.--Baked Beans and Tomato Salad.    Stir 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar very gradually into 6 tablespoonfuls of  oil and a dash of paprika. Add salt, if the beans have not been  seasoned. The oil and vinegar will not unite perfectly. Pour gradually  over a pint of cold baked beans such portions of the dressing as they  will absorb, toss together and arrange on a serving dish. Make a border  of sliced tomatoes around the beans and over these pour the rest of the  dressing.--Janet Hill in \"Boston Cooking School Magazine.\"      20.--Tomato Croquettes.    Stew together for 20 minutes 1/2 a can of tomatoes, 1 tablespoonful of  chopped onion, 1 sprig of parsley, 1/2 a bay leaf, 4 cloves and enough  salt and pepper to season highly. Rub through a sieve. In a clean  saucepan melt together 2 tablespoonfuls of butter and 5 tablespoonfuls  of flour. Add 2 cupfuls of the strained tomato and stir and cook for ten  minutes. Take from the fire and set aside until cold. Flour the hands  and carefully mould into small croquettes. Dip each into slightly beaten  egg and roll in fine bread crumbs. Let stand for 20 minutes, then repeat  the dipping and rolling in crumbs. Fry at once in very hot fat and drain  on unglazed paper.--\"Table Talk,\" Phila.      21.--Eggs on Rice.    Cover a platter an inch deep with hot well-boiled rice, to which has  been added 1 tablespoonful of melted butter. On this serve six  well-poached eggs. Garnish with parsley.      22.--Baked Celery.    Parboil a bunch of celery, using only the stalks; cut into two inch  lengths, put them into a baking dish. Rub smooth 2 tablespoonfuls of  butter and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24388"],[0,"Squirrels and Other Fur-Bearers (#1)"],[1,"(https://www.pgdp.net)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this file        which includes the original lovely illustrations in color.

On examination I found that every burr had been cut square off  with about an inch of the stem adhering, and not one had been left on  the tree. It was not accident, then, but design. Whose design? A  squirrel's. The fruit was the finest I had ever seen in the woods, and  some wise squirrel had marked it for his own. The burrs were ripe, and  had just begun to divide. The squirrel that had taken all this pains had  evidently reasoned with himself thus: \"Now, these are extremely fine  chestnuts, and I want them; if I wait till the burrs open on the tree,  the crows and jays will be sure to carry off a great many of the nuts  before they fall; then, after the wind has rattled out what remain,  there are the mice, the chipmunks, the red squirrels, the raccoons, the  grouse, to say nothing of the boys and the pigs, to come in for their  share; so I will forestall events a little: I will cut off the burrs  when they have matured, and a few days of this dry October weather will  cause every one of them to open on the ground; I shall be on hand in the  nick of time to gather up my nuts.\" The squirrel, of course, had to take  the chances of a prowler like myself coming along, but he had fairly  stolen a march on his neighbors. As I proceeded to collect and open the  burrs, I was half prepared to hear an audible protest from the trees  about, for I constantly fancied myself watched by shy but jealous eyes.  It is an interesting inquiry how the squirrel knew the burrs would open  if left to lie on the ground a few days. Perhaps he did not know, but  thought the experiment worth trying.      One reason, doubtless, why squirrels are so bold and reckless in leaping  through the trees is that, if they miss their hold and fall, they  sustain no injury. Every species of tree-squirrel seems to be capable of  a sort of rudimentary flying,--at least of making itself into a  parachute, so as to ease or break a fall or a leap from a great height.  The so-called flying squirrel does this the most perfectly. It opens  its furry vestments, leaps into the air, and sails down the steep  incline from the top of one tree to the foot of the next as lightly as a  bird. But other squirrels know the same trick, only their coat-skirts  are not so broad. One day my dog treed a red squirrel in a tall hickory  that stood in a meadow on the side of a steep hill. To see what the  squirrel would do when closely pressed, I climbed the tree. As I drew  near he took refuge in the topmost branch, and then, as I came on, he  boldly leaped into the air, spread himself out upon it, and, with a  quick, tremulous motion of his tail and legs, descended quite slowly and  landed upon the ground thirty feet below me, apparently none the worse  for the leap, for he ran with great speed and eluding the dog took  refuge in another tree.    A recent American traveler in Mexico gives a still more striking  instance of this power of squirrels partially to neutralize the force of  gravity when leaping or falling through the air. Some boys had caught a  Mexican black squirrel, nearly as large as a cat. It had escaped from  them once, and, when pursued, had taken a leap of sixty feet, from the  top of a pine-tree down upon the roof of a house, without injury. This  feat had led the grandmother of one of the boys to declare that the  squirrel was bewitched, and the boys proposed to put the matter to  further test by throwing the squirrel down a precipice six hundred feet  high. Our traveler interfered, to see that the squirrel had fair play.  The prisoner was conveyed in a pillow-slip to the edge of the cliff, and  the slip opened, so that he might have his choice, whether to remain a  captive or to take the leap. He looked down the awful abyss, and then  back and sidewise,--his eyes glistening, his form crouching. Seeing no  escape in any other direction, \"he took a flying leap into space, and  fluttered rather than fell into the abyss below. His legs began to work  like those of a swimming poodle-dog, but quicker and quicker, while his  tail, slightly elevated, spread out like a feather fan. A rabbit of the  same weight would have made the trip in about twelve seconds; the  squirrel protracted it for more than half a minute,\" and \"landed on a  ledge of limestone, where we could see him plainly squat on his hind  legs and smooth his ruffled fur, after which he made for the creek with  a flourish of his tail, took a good drink, and scampered away into the  willow thicket.\"    [Illustration: FLYING SQUIRREL]    The story at first blush seems incredible, but I have no doubt our red  squirrel would have made the leap safely; then why not the great black  squirrel, since its parachute would be proportionately large?    The tails of the squirrels are broad and long and flat, not short and  small like those of gophers, chipmunks, woodchucks, and other ground  rodents, and when they leap or fall through the air the tail is arched  and rapidly vibrates. A squirrel's tail, therefore, is something more  than ornament, something more than a flag; it not only aids him in  flying, but it serves as a cloak, which he wraps about him when he  sleeps.    In making the flying leap I have described the animals' legs are widely  extended, their bodies broadened and flattened, the tail stiffened and  slightly curved, and a curious tremulous motion runs through all. It is  very obvious that a deliberate attempt is made to present the broadest  surface possible to the air, and I think a red squirrel might leap from  almost any height to the ground without serious injury. Our flying  squirrel is in no proper sense a flyer. On the ground he is more  helpless than a chipmunk, because less agile. He can only sail or slide  down a steep incline from the top of one tree to the foot of another.  The flying squirrel is active only at night; hence its large, soft eyes,  its soft fur, and its gentle, shrinking ways. It is the gentlest and  most harmless of our rodents. A pair of them for two or three  successive years had their nest behind the blinds of an upper window of  a large, unoccupied country-house near me. You could stand in the room  inside and observe the happy family through the window pane against  which their nest pressed. There on the window sill lay a pile of large,  shining chestnuts, which they were evidently holding against a time of  scarcity, as the pile did not diminish while I observed them. The nest  was composed of cotton and wool which they filched from a bed in one of  the chambers, and it was always a mystery how they got into the room to  obtain it. There seemed to be no other avenue but the chimney flue.      Red and gray squirrels are more or less active all winter, though very  shy, and, I am inclined to think, partially nocturnal in their habits.  Here a gray one has just passed,--came down that tree and went up this;  there he dug for a beechnut, and left the burr on the snow. How did he  know where to dig? During an unusually severe winter I have known him to  make long journeys to a barn, in a remote field, where wheat was stored.  How did he know there was wheat there? In attempting to return, the  adventurous "]]]
