It tells of some  experiences not altogether new, and contains observations and facts  that have been noted by other writers; but the author hopes that,  from the viewpoint of an automobilist at least, its novelty will  serve as a recommendation. As a pastime automobile touring is still  new and is not yet accomplished without some considerable annoyance  and friction. The conventional guides are of little assistance; and  the more descriptive works on travel fail too often to note the  continually changing conditions which affect the tourist alike by  road and rail._    [Illustration: Hotel Bellevue les Andelys]    Contents    Part 1     General Information--The Grand Tour  Chapter 1  An Appreciation Of The Automobile  Chapter 2  Travel Talk  Chapter 3  Roads And Routes  Chapter 4  Hotels And Things  Chapter 5  The Grand Tour    Part 2     Touring In France  Chapter 1  Down Through Tourane: Paris To Bourdeaux  Chapter 2  A Little Tour In The Pyrenees  Chapter 3  In Languedoc And Old Provence  Chapter 4  By Rhone And Saone  Chapter 5  By Seine And Oise--A Cruise In A Canot-Automobile  Chapter 6  The Road To The North    Part 3     On Britain's Roads  Chapter 1  The Bath Road  Chapter 2  The South Coast  Chapter 3  Land's End To John O'Groats    Part 4     In Belgium, Holland, And Germany  Chapter 1  On The Road To Flanders  Chapter 2  By Dykes And Windmills  Chapter 3  On The Road By The Rhine    Appendices  Index      Part I  General Information--The Grand Tour    Chapter I  An Appreciation of the Automobile    [Illustration: An Appreciation of the Automobile]    We have progressed appreciably beyond the days of the old horseless  carriage, which, it will be remembered, retained even the dashboard.    To-day the modern automobile somewhat resembles, in its outlines,  across between a decapod locomotive and a steam fire-engine, or at  least something concerning the artistic appearance of which the  layman has very grave doubts.    The control of a restive horse, a cranky boat, or even a trolley-car  on rails is difficult enough for the inexperienced, and there are  many who would quail before making the attempt; but to the novice in  charge of an automobile, some serious damage is likely enough to  occur within an incredibly short space of time, particularly if he  does not take into account the tremendous force and power which he  controls merely by the moving of a tiny lever, or by the depressing  of a pedal.    Any one interested in automobiles should know something of the  literature of the subject, which, during the last decade, has already  become formidable.    In English the literature of the automobile begins with Mr. Worby  Beaumont's Cantor Lectures (1895), and the pamphlet by Mr. R. Jenkins  on \"Power Locomotion on the Highways,\" published in 1896.    In the library of the Patent Office in London the literature of motor  road vehicles already fills many shelves. The catalogue is  interesting as showing the early hopes that inventors had in  connection with steam as a motive power for light road vehicles, and  will be of value to all who are interested in the history of the  movement or the progress made in motor-car design.    In France the Bibliotheque of the Touring Club de France contains a  hundred entries under the caption \"Automobiles,\" besides complete  files of eleven leading journals devoted to that industry. With these  two sources of information at hand, and aided by the records of the  Automobile Club de France and the Automobile Club of Great Britain  and Ireland, the present-day historian of the automobile will find  the subject well within his grasp.    There are those who doubt the utility of the automobile, as there  have been scoffers at most new things under the sun; and there have  been critics who have derided it for its \"seven deadly sins,\" as  there have been others who have praised its \"Christian graces.\" The  parodist who wrote the following newspaper quatrain was no enemy of  the automobile in spite of his cynicism.      \"A look of anguish underneath the car,    Another start; a squeak, a grunt, a jar!    The Aspiration pipe is working loose!    The vapour can't get out! And there you are!\"      \"Strange is it not, that of the myriads who    Have Empty Tanks and know not what to do,    Not one will tell of it when he Returns.    As for Ourselves, why, we deny it, too.\"    The one perfectly happy man in an automobile is he who drives,  steers, or \"runs the thing,\" even though he be merely the hired  chauffeur. For proof of this one has only to note how readily  others volunteer to \"spell him a bit,\" as the saying goes.  Change of scene and the exhilaration of a swift rush through space  are all very well for friends in the _tonneau_, but for real  \"pleasure\" one must be the driver. Not even the manifold  responsibilities of the post will mar one's enjoyment, and there is  always a supreme satisfaction in keeping one's engine running  smoothly.    \"Nothing to watch but the road,\" is the general motto for the  automobile manufacturer, but the enthusiastic automobilist goes  farther, and, for his motto, takes \"stick to your post,\" and, in case  of danger, as one has put it, \"pull everything you see, and put your  foot on everything else.\"    The vocabulary of the automobile has produced an entirely new  \"jargon,\" which is Greek to the multitude, but, oh, so expressive and  full of meaning to the initiated.    An automobile is masculine, or feminine, as one likes to think of it,  for it has many of the vagaries of both sexes. The French Academy has  finally come to the fore and declared the word to be masculine, and  so, taking our clue once more from the French (as we have in most  things in the automobile world), we must call it _him_, and speak of  it as _he_, instead of _her_, or _she_.    That other much overworked word in automobilism, _chauffeur_, should  be placed once for all. The driver of an automobile is not really a  _chauffeur_, neither is he who minds and cares for the engine; he is  a _mecanicien_ and nothing else--in France and elsewhere. We needed a  word for the individual who busies himself with, or drives an  automobile, and so we have adapted the word _chauffeur_. Purists may  cavil, but nevertheless the word is better than _driver_, or  _motor_-_man_ (which is the quintessence of snobbery), or  _conductor_.    The word, _chauffeur_, the Paris _Figaro_ tells us, was known long  before the advent of automobiles or locomotives. History tells that  about the year 1795, men strangely accoutred, their faces covered  with soot and their eyes carefully disguised, entered, by night,  farms and lonely habitations and committed all sorts of depredations.  They garroted their victims, or dragged them before a great fire  where they burned the soles of their feet, and demanded information  as to the whereabouts of their money and jewels. Hence they were  called _chauffeurs_, a name which frightened our grandfathers as much  as the scorching _chauffeur_ to-day frightens our grandchildren.    A motor-car is a fearsome thing,--when it goes, it goes; and when it  doesn't, something, or many things, are wrong. A few years ago this  uncertainty was to be expected, for, though the makers will not  whisper it in Gath, we are only just getting out of the bone-shaker  age of automobiles.    Every one remembers what a weirdly ungraceful thing was the first  safety bicycle, and so was the gaudy painted-up early locomotive--and  they are so yet on certain English lines where their early Victorian  engines are like Kipling's ocean tramp, merely \"puttied up with  paint.\" So with the early automobiles, they jarred and jerked and  stopped--that is, under all but exceptional conditions. Occasionally  they did wonderful things,--they always did, in fact, when one took  the word of their owners; but now they really do acquit themselves  with credit, and so the public, little by little, is beginning to  believe in them, even though the millennium has not arrived when  every home possesses its own runabout.    All this proves that we are \"getting there\" by degrees, and meantime  everybody that has to do with motor-cars has learned a great deal,  generally at somebody else's expense.    To-day every one \"motes,\" or wants to, and likewise a knowledge of  many things mechanical, which had heretofore been between closed  covers, is in the daily litany of many who had previously never known  a clutch from a cam-shaft, or a sparking plug from a fly-wheel.    Most motor enthusiasts read all the important journals devoted to the  game. The old-stager reads them for their hints and suggestions,--  though these are bewildering in their multiplicity and their  contradictions,--and the ladies of the household look at them for the  sake of their pretty pictures of scenery and ladies and veils and  furry garments pertaining to the sport.    Catalogues are another bane of the motorist's life. He may have just  become possessed of the latest thing in a Mercedes (and paid an  enhanced price for an early delivery), yet upon seeing some new make  of car advertised, he will immediately send for a catalogue and  prospectus, and make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                    [Illustration: GOLDFINCH (page 125)]                   BIRD STORIES          FROM BURROUGHS         SKETCHES OF BIRD LIFE      TAKEN FROM THE WORKS OF            JOHN BURROUGHS            _WITH ILLUSTRATIONS     BY LOUIS AGASSIZ FUERTES_                 [Device]         BOSTON  NEW YORK  CHICAGO     HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY   The Riverside Press Cambridge          COPYRIGHT, 1871, 1875, 1876, 1877, 1879, 1881, 1886, 1894, 1899, 1903,  1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, BY JOHN BURROUGHS    COPYRIGHT, 1911, BY HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY      Transcriber's Note:        Hyphenation has been standardised.

PUBLISHERS' NOTE      John Burroughs's first book, \"Wake-Robin,\" contained a chapter entitled  \"The Invitation.\" It was an invitation to the study of birds. He has  reiterated it, implicitly if not explicitly, in most of the books he has  published since then, and many of his readers have joyfully accepted it.  Indeed, such an invitation from Mr. Burroughs is the best possible  introduction to the birds of our Northeastern States, and it is likewise  an introduction to some very good reading. To convey this invitation to  a wider circle of young readers the most interesting bird stories in Mr.  Burroughs's books have been gathered into a single volume. A chapter is  given to each species of bird, and the chapters are arranged in a sort  of chronological order, according to the time of the bird's arrival in  the spring, the nesting time, or the season when for some other reason  the species is particularly conspicuous. In taking the stories out of  their original setting a few slight verbal alterations have been  necessary here and there, but these have been made either by Mr.  Burroughs himself or with his approval.

There never was a happier or more devoted husband than the male  bluebird. He is the gay champion and escort of the female at all times,  and while she is sitting he feeds her regularly. It is very pretty to  watch them building their nest. The male is very active in hunting out a  place and exploring the boxes and cavities, but seems to have no choice  in the matter and is anxious only to please and encourage his mate, who  has the practical turn and knows what will do and what will not. After  she has suited herself he applauds her immensely, and away the two go in  quest of material for the nest, the male acting as guard and flying  above and in advance of the female. She brings all the material and  does all the work of building, he looking on and encouraging her with  gesture and song. He acts also as inspector of her work, but I fear is a  very partial one. She enters the nest with her bit of dry grass or  straw, and, having adjusted it to her notion, withdraws and waits near  by while he goes in and looks it over. On coming out he exclaims very  plainly, \"Excellent! excellent!\" and away the two go again for more  material.    I was much amused one summer day in seeing a bluebird feeding her young  one in the shaded street of a large town. She had captured a cicada or  harvest-fly, and, after bruising it awhile on the ground, flew with it  to a tree and placed it in the beak of the young bird. It was a large  morsel, and the mother seemed to have doubts of her chick's ability to  dispose of it, for she stood near and watched its efforts with great  solicitude. The young bird struggled valiantly with the cicada, but made  no headway in swallowing it, when the mother took it from him and flew  to the sidewalk, and proceeded to break and bruise it more thoroughly.  Then she again placed it in his beak, and seemed to say, \"There, try it  now,\" and sympathized so thoroughly with his efforts that she repeated  many of his motions and contortions. But the great fly was unyielding,  and, indeed, seemed ridiculously disproportioned to the beak that held  it. The young bird fluttered and fluttered, and screamed, \"I'm stuck,  I'm stuck!\" till the anxious parent again seized the morsel and carried  it to an iron railing, where she came down upon it for the space of a  minute with all the force and momentum her beak could command. Then she  offered it to her young a third time, but with the same result as  before, except that this time the bird dropped it; but she reached the  ground as soon as the cicada did, and taking it in her beak flew a  little distance to a high board fence, where she sat motionless for some  moments. While pondering the problem how that fly should be broken, the  male bluebird approached her, and said very plainly, and I thought  rather curtly, \"Give me that bug,\" but she quickly resented his  interference and flew farther away, where she sat apparently quite  discouraged when I last saw her.           *       *       *       *       *    One day in early May, Ted and I made an expedition to the Shattega, a  still, dark, deep stream that loiters silently through the woods not far  from my cabin. As we paddled along, we were on the alert for any bit of  wild life of bird or beast that might turn up.    There were so many abandoned woodpecker chambers in the small dead  trees as we went along that I determined to secure the section of a tree  containing a good one to take home and put up for the bluebirds. \"Why  don't the bluebirds occupy them here?\" inquired Ted. \"Oh,\" I replied,  \"bluebirds do not come so far into the woods as this. They prefer  nesting-places in the open, and near human habitations.\" After carefully  scrutinizing several of the trees, we at last saw one that seemed to  fill the bill. It was a small dead tree-trunk seven or eight inches in  diameter, that leaned out over the water, and from which the top had  been broken. The hole, round and firm, was ten or twelve feet above us.  After considerable effort I succeeded in breaking the stub off near the  ground, and brought it down into the boat. \"Just the thing,\" I said;  \"surely the bluebirds will prefer this to an artificial box.\" But, lo  and behold, it already had bluebirds in it! We had not heard a sound or  seen a feather till the trunk was in our hands, when, on peering into  the cavity, we discovered two young bluebirds about half grown. This was  a predicament indeed!    Well, the only thing we could do was to stand the tree-trunk up again as  well as we could, and as near as we could to where it had stood before.  This was no easy thing. But after a time we had it fairly well  replaced, one end standing in the mud of the shallow water and the other  resting against a tree. This left the hole to the nest about ten feet  below and to one side of its former position. Just then we heard the  "]]]
