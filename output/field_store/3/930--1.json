Abbreviations: This information is included in Appendix A:  Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms  used in the Factbook, with their expansions.    Administrative divisions: This entry generally gives the  numbers, designatory terms, and first-order administrative  divisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names  (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on  by BGN are noted.    Age structure: This entry provides the distribution of the  population according to age. Information is included by sex  and age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over).  The age structure of a population affects a nation's key  socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high  percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools,  while countries with older populations (high percentage ages  65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The  age structure can also be used to help predict potential  political issues. For example, the rapid growth of a young  adult population unable to find employment can lead to  unrest.    Agriculture--products: This entry is a rank ordering of major  crops and products starting with the most important.    Airports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The  runway(s) may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or  unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be  usable.

THE FIRST ATOMIC TEST      On Monday morning July 16, 1945, the world was changed forever when  the first atomic bomb was tested in an isolated area of the New Mexico  desert. Conducted in the final month of World War II by the top-secret  Manhattan Engineer District, this test was code named Trinity. The  Trinity test took place on the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range,  about 230 miles south of the Manhattan Project's headquarters at Los  Alamos, New Mexico. Today this 3,200 square mile range, partly located  in the desolate Jornada del Muerto Valley, is named the White Sands  Missile Range and is actively used for non-nuclear weapons testing.    Before the war the range was mostly public and private grazing land  that had always been sparsely populated. During the war it was even  more lonely and deserted because the ranchers had agreed to vacate their  homes in January 1942. They left because the War Department wanted the  land to use as an artillery and bombing practice area. In September  1944, a remote 18 by 24 square mile portion of the north-east corner  of the Bombing Range was set aside for the Manhattan Project and the  Trinity test by the military.    The selection of this remote location in the Jornada del Muerto Valley  for the Trinity test was from an initial list of eight possible test  sites. Besides the Jornada, three of the other seven sites were also  located in New Mexico: the Tularosa Basin near Alamogordo, the lava  beds (now the El Malpais National Monument) south of Grants, and an area  southwest of Cuba and north of Thoreau. Other possible sites not located  in New Mexico were: an Army training area north of Blythe, California,  in the Mojave Desert; San Nicolas Island (one of the Channel Islands)  off the coast of Southern California; and on Padre Island south of  Corpus Christi, Texas, in the Gulf of Mexico. The last choice for the  test was in the beautiful San Luis Valley of south-central Colorado,  near today's Great Sand Dunes National Monument.    Based on a number of criteria that included availability, distance from  Los Alamos, good weather, few or no settlements, and that no Indian land  would be used, the choices for the test site were narrowed down to two  in the summer of 1944. First choice was the military training area  in southern California. The second choice, was the Jornada del Muerto  Valley in New Mexico. The final site selection was made in late August  1944 by Major General Leslie R. Groves, the military head of the  Manhattan Project. When General Groves discovered that in order to use  the California location he would need the permission of its commander,  General George Patton, Groves quickly decided on the second choice,  the Jornada del Muerto. This was because General Groves did not want  anything to do with the flamboyant Patton, who Groves had once described  as \"the most disagreeable man I had ever met.\"[1] Despite being second  choice the remote Jornada was a good location for the test, because it  provided isolation for secrecy and safety, was only 230 miles south of  Los Alamos, and was already under military control. Plus, the Jornada  enjoyed relatively good weather.    The history of the Jornada is in itself quite fascinating, since it was  given its name by the Spanish conquerors of New Mexico. The Jornada  was a short cut on the Camino Real, the King's Highway that linked old  Mexico to Santa Fe, the capital of New Mexico. The Camino Real went  north from Mexico City till it joined the Rio Grande near present day El  Paso, Texas. Then the trail followed the river valley further north to  a point where the river curved to the west, and its valley narrowed and  became impassable for the supply wagons. To avoid this obstacle, the  wagons took the dubious detour north across the Jornada del Muerto.  Sixty miles of desert, very little water, and numerous hostile Apaches.  Hence the name Jornada del Muerto, which is often translated as the  journey of death or as the route of the dead man. It is also interesting  to note that in the late 16th century, the Spanish considered their  province of New Mexico to include most of North America west of the  Mississippi!    The origin of the code name Trinity for the test site is also  interesting, but the true source is unknown. One popular account  attributes the name to J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific head of the  Manhattan Project. According to this version, the well read Oppenheimer  based the name Trinity on the fourteenth Holy Sonnet by John Donne, a  16th century English poet and sermon writer. The sonnet started, \"Batter  my heart, three-personed God.\"[2] Another version of the name's origin  comes from University of New Mexico historian Ferenc M. Szasz. In his  1984 book, The Day the Sun Rose Twice, Szasz quotes Robert W. Henderson  head of the Engineering Group in the Explosives Division of the  Manhattan Project. Henderson told Szasz that the name Trinity came from  Major W. A. (Lex) Stevens. According to Henderson, he and Stevens were  at the test site discussing the best way to haul Jumbo (see below) the  thirty miles from the closest railway siding to the test site. \"A devout  Roman Catholic, Stevens observed that the railroad siding was called  'Pope's Siding.' He [then] remarked that the Pope had special access to  the Trinity, and that the scientists would need all the help they could  get to move the 214 ton Jumbo to its proper spot.\"[3]    The Trinity test was originally set for July 4, 1945. However, final  preparations for the test, which included the assembly of the bomb's  plutonium core, did not begin in earnest until Thursday, July 12. The  abandoned George McDonald ranch house located two miles south of the  test site served as the assembly point for the device's core. After  assembly, the plutonium core was transported to Trinity Site to be  inserted into the thing or gadget as the atomic device was called. But,  on the first attempt to insert the core it stuck! After letting the  temperatures of the core and the gadget equalize, the core fit perfectly  to the great relief of all present. The completed device was raised  to the top of a 100-foot steel tower on Saturday, July 14. During this  process workers piled up mattresses beneath the gadget to cushion  a possible fall. When the bomb reached the top of the tower without  mishap, installation of the explosive detonators began. The 100-foot  tower (a surplus Forest Service fire-watch tower) was designated Point  Zero. Ground Zero was at the base of the tower.    As a result of all the anxiety surrounding the possibility of a failure  of the test, a verse by an unknown author circulated around Los Alamos.  It read:       From this crude lab that spawned a dud.     Their necks to Truman's ax uncurled     Lo, the embattled savants stood,     and fired the flop heard round the world.[4]    A betting pool was also started by scientists at Los Alamos on the  possible yield of the Trinity test. Yields from 45,000 tons of TNT  to zero were selected by the various bettors. The Nobel Prize-winning  (1938) physicist Enrico Fermi was willing to bet anyone that the  test would wipe out all life on Earth, with special odds on the mere  destruction of the entire State of New Mexico!    Meanwhile back at the test site, technicians installed seismographic  and photographic equipment at varying distances from the tower. Other  instruments were set up for recording radioactivity, temperature, air  pressure, and similar data needed by the project scientists.    According to Lansing Lamont in his 1965 book Day of Trinity, life at  Trinity could at times be very exciting. One afternoon while scientists  were busily setting up test instruments in the desert, the tail gunner  of a low flying B-29 bomber spotted some grazing antelopes and opened up  with his twin.50-caliber machine guns. \"A dozen scientists,... under the  plane and out of the gunner's line of vision, dropped their instruments  and hugged the ground in terror as the bullets thudded about them.\"[5]  Later a number of these scientists threatened to quit the project.    Workers built three observation points 5.68 miles (10,000 yards), north,  south, and west of Ground Zero. Code named Able, Baker, and Pittsburgh,  these heavily-built wooden bunkers were reinforced with concrete, and  covered with earth. The bunker designated Baker or South 10,000 served  as the control center for the test. This is where head scientist J.  Robert Oppenheimer would be for the test.    A fourth observation point was the test's Base Camp, (the abandoned Dave  McDonald ranch) located about ten miles southwest of Ground Zero. The  primary observation point was on Compania Hill, located about 20 miles  to the northwest of Trinity near today's Stallion Range Gate, off NM  380.    The test was originally scheduled for 4 a.m., Monday July 16, but was  postponed to 5:30 due to a severe thunderstorm that would have increased  the amount of radioactive fallout, and have interfered with the test  results. The rain finally stopped and at 5:29:45 a.m. Mountain War  Time, the device exploded successfully and the Atomic Age was born. The  nuclear blast created a flash of light brighter than a dozen suns.  The light was seen over the entire state of New Mexico and in parts of  Arizona, Texas, and Mexico. The resultant mushroom cloud rose to over  38,000 feet within minutes, and the heat of the explosion was 10,000  times hotter than the surface of the sun! At ten miles away, this heat  was described as like standing directly in front of a roaring fireplace.  Every living thing within a mile of the tower was obliterated. The  power of the bomb"]]]
