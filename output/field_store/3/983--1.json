When added together  with \"M1\" the total money supply is known as \"M2.\" \"Stock of domestic  credit\" is the total quantity of credit, denominated in the domestic  currency, provided by banks to nonbanking institutions.    - In the Geography category, two new fields focus on the increasingly  vital resource of water: \"Total renewable water resources\" and  \"Freshwater withdrawal.\"    - Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the  2001 edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional maps have  also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name spelling  changes.          ======================================================================          The World Factbook (2008) -

NEW-YORK, MAY 1, 1851. No. II.          GEORGE WILKINS KENDALL.    [Illustration]      We have here a capital portrait of the editor in chief of the New  Orleans _Picayune_, GEORGE W. KENDALL, who, as an editor, author,  traveller, or _bon garcon_, is world-famous, and every where entitled to  be chairman in assemblies of these several necessary classes of people.  Take him for all in all, he may be described as a new Chevalier Bayard,  baptized in the spirit of fun, and with a steel pen in lieu of a blade  of Damascus. He is a Vermonter--of the state which has sent out Orestes  Brownson, Herman Hooker, the Coltons, Hiram Powers, Hannah Gould, and a  crowd of other men and women with the sharpest intellects, and for the  most part the genialist tempers too, that can be found in all the  country. His boyhood was passed in the delightful village of Burlington,  from which, when he was of age, he came to New-York, and here he lived  until about the year 1835, when he went to New Orleans, where his  subsequent career may be found traced in the most witty and brilliant  and altogether successful journal ever published in the southern or  western states.    Partly for the love of adventure and partly for advantage to his health,  in the spring of 1841 Mr. Kendall determined to make an excursion into  the great south-western prairies, and the contemplated trading  expedition to Santa-Fe offering escort and agreeable companions, he  procured passports from the Mexican vice-consul at New-Orleans, and  joined it, at Austin. The history of this expedition has become an  important portion of the history of the nation, and its details,  embracing an account of his own captivity and sufferings in Mexico, were  written by Mr. Kendall in one of the most spirited and graphic books of  military and wilderness adventure, vicissitude, and endurance, that has  been furnished in our times. The work was published in two volumes, by  the Harpers, in 1844. It has since passed through many editions, and for  the fidelity and felicity, the bravery and _bon hommie_, that mark all  its pages, it is likely to be one of the choicest chronicles that will  be quoted from our own in the new centuries.    After the publication of his narrative of the Santa Fe Expedition, Mr.  Kendall resumed his more immediate services in the _Picayane_--always,  it may be said without injustice to his associates, most attractive  under his personal supervision; and in the angry and war-tending  controversies with Mexico which filled the public mind in the succeeding  years, he was one of the calmest as well as wisest of our journalists.  When at length the conflict came on, he attended the victorious Taylor  as a member of his staff along the mountains and valleys which that  great commander marked with the names of immortal victories, and had  more than satisfaction for all griefs of his own in seeing the flag of  his country planted in every scene in which his country had been  insulted in his own person.    Upon the conclusion of the war, Mr. Kendall commenced the preparation of  the magnificent work which has lately been published in this city by the  Appletons, under the title of _The War between the United States and  Mexico, by George W. Kendall, illustrated by pictorial drawings by Carl  Nebel_. Mr. Nebel may be regarded as one of the best battle-painters  living. He accompanied Mr. Kendall during the war, and made his sketches  while on the several fields where he had witnessed the movements of the  contending armies; and in all the accessories of scenery, costume, and  general effect, he has unquestionably been as successful as the actors  in the drama admit him to have been in giving a vivid and just  impression of the distinguishing characteristics of each conflict. The  subjects of the plates are the Bombardment of Vera Cruz, the Battle of  Cerro Gordo, the Storming of Chepultepec, the Assault on Contreras, the  Battle of Cherubusco, the Attack on Molino del Rey, General Scott's  Entrance into Mexico, the Battle of Buena Vista, the Battle of Palo  Alto, and the Capture of Monterey. In some cases, there are two  representations of the same scene, taken from different points of view.  These have all been reproduced in colored lithography by the best  artists of Paris. The literary part of the work, comprising very careful  and particular accounts of these events, is excellently written--so  compactly and perspicuously, with so thorough a knowledge and so pure a  taste, as to be deserving of applause among models in military history.  Mr. Kendall passed about two years in Europe for the purpose of  superintending its publication, and its success must have amply  satisfied the most sanguine anticipations with which he entered upon its  composition.    New England is largely represented among the leading editors of the  South and West, and it is a little remarkable that the two papers most  conspicuous as representatives of the idiosyncrasies which most obtain  in their respective states--the _Picayune_ and George D. Prentice's  _Louisville Journal_--are conducted by men from sections most  antagonistical in interest and feeling, men who have carried with them  to their new homes and who still cherish there all the reciprocated  affections by which they were connected with the North. When George W.  Kendall leaves New Orleans for his summer wandering in our more  comfortable and safe latitudes, an ovation of editors awaits him at  every town along the Mississippi, and, crossing the mountains, he is the  most popular member of the craft in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia,  New-York, or Boston--an evidence that the strifes of party may exist  without any personal ill-feeling, if the editor never forgets in his own  person to sustain the character of a gentleman.            WASHINGTON.      It is a truth, illustrated in daily experience, and yet rarely noted or  acted upon, that, in all that concerns the appreciation of personal  character or ability, the instinctive impressions of a community are  quicker in their action, more profoundly appreciant, and more reliable,  than the intellectual perceptions of the ablest men in the community.  Upon all those subjects that are of moral apprehension, society seems to  possess an intelligence of its own, infinitely sensitive in its  delicacy, and almost conclusive in the certainty of its determinations;  indirect, and unconscious in its operation, yet unshunnable in sagacity,  and as strong and confident as nature itself. The highest and finest  qualities of human judgment seem to be in commission among the nation,  or the race. It is by such a process, that whenever a true hero appears  among mankind, the recognition of his character, by the general sense of  humanity, is instant and certain: the belief of the chief priests and  rulers of mind follows later, or comes not at all. The perceptions of a  public are as subtly-sighted as its passions are blind. It sees, and  feels, and knows the excellence, which it can neither understand, nor  explain, nor vindicate. These involuntary opinions of people at large  explain themselves, and are vindicated by events, and form at last the  constants of human understanding. A character of the first order of  greatness, such as seems to pass out of the limits and courses of  ordinary life, often lies above the ken of intellectual judgment; but  its merits and its infirmities never escape the sleepless perspicacity  of the common sentiment, which no novelty of form can surprise, and no  mixture of qualities can perplex. The mind--the logical  faculty--comprehends a subject, when it can trace in it the same  elements, or relations, which it is familiar with elsewhere; if it finds  but a faint analogy of form or substance, its decision is embarrassed.  But this other instinct seems to become subtler, and more rapid, and  more absolute in conviction, at the line where reason begins to falter.    Take the case of Shakspeare. His surpassing greatness was never  acknowledged by the learned, until the nation had ascertained and  settled it as a foregone and questionless conclusion. Even now, to the  most sagacious mind of this time, the real ground and evidence of its  own assurance of Shakspeare's supremacy, is the universal, deep,  immovable conviction of it in the public feeling. There have been many  acute essays upon his minor characteristics; but intellectual criticism  has never grappled with Shaksperian ART in its entireness and grandeur,  and probably it never will. We know not now wherein his greatness  consists. We cannot demonstrate it. There is less indistinctness in the  merit of less eminent authors. Those things which are not doubts to our  consciousness, are yet mysteries to our mind. And if this is true of  literary art, which is so much within the sphere of reflection, it may  be expected to find more striking illustration in great practical and  public moral characters.    [Illustration: THE NATIONAL MONUMENT AT WASHINGTON.]    These considerations occur naturally to the mind in contemplating the  fame of Washington. An attentive examination of the whole subject, and  of all that can contribute to the formation of a sound opinion, results  in the belief that General Washington's _mental_ abilities illustrate  the very highest type of greatness. His _mind_, probably, was one of the  very greatest that was ever given to mortality. Yet it is impossible to  establish that position by a direct analysis of his character, or  conduct, or productions. When we look at the incidents or the results of  that great career--when we contemplate the qualities by which it is  marked, from its beginning to its end--the"]]]
