PREFACE.      The primary object of the present work, is to give as correct and  comprehensive a view of the animals composing the Ox Tribe, as the  present state of our knowledge will admit, accompanied by authentic  figures of all the known species and the more remarkable varieties.    Although this genus (comprising all those Ruminants called Buffaloes,  Bisons, and Oxen generally,) is as distinct and well characterised as  any other genus in the animal kingdom, yet the facts which are at  present known respecting the various species which compose it, are not  sufficiently numerous to enable the naturalist to divide them into  sub-genera. This is abundantly proved by the unsuccessful result of  those attempts which have already been made to arrange them into minor  groups. Nor can we wonder at this want of success, when we consider that  even many of the species usually regarded as distinct are by no means  clearly defined.    The second object, therefore, of this treatise, is (by bringing into  juxta-position all the most important facts concerning the various  individual specimens which have been described, and by adding several  other facts of importance which have not hitherto been noticed,) to  enable the naturalist to define, more correctly than has yet been done,  the peculiarities of each species.    A third object is to direct the attention of travellers more  particularly to this subject; in order that, by their exertions, our  information upon this class of animals may be rendered more complete.    A new and important feature in the present Monograph, is the  introduction of a Table of the Number of Vertebrae, carefully constructed  from an examination of the actual skeletons, by which will be seen at a  glance the principal osteological differences of species which have  hitherto been confounded with each other. A Table of the Periods of  Gestation is likewise added, which presents some equally interesting  results.    Several of the descriptions have been verified by a reference to the  living animals, seven specimens of which are at present (1847) in the  Gardens of the Zoological Society, Regent's Park. The several Museums in  the Metropolis have likewise been consulted with advantage.    I am indebted to Judge FURNAM, of the United States, for some original  information respecting the American Bison; and also to the late Mr.  COLE, who was forty years park-keeper at Chillingham, for answers to  several questions which I proposed to him on the subject of the  Chillingham Cattle.    I beg to acknowledge my obligation to Mr. CATLIN for kindly allowing me,  not only to make extracts, but also to copy some of the outlines from  his 'Letters and Notes on the North American Indians,' a work which I do  not hesitate to pronounce one of the most curious and interesting which  the present century has produced,--whether we regard the graphic merits  of its literary or pictorial department.    To Professor OWEN and the Officers of the Royal College of Surgeons, to  the Officers of the Zoological Society, and to the Officers of the  Zoological Department of the British Museum, my sincere thanks are due  for the kindness and promptness with which every information has been  given, and every facility afforded to my inquiries and investigations.    With respect to the engraved figures, I have striven to produce correct  delineations of form and texture, rather than to make pretty pictures by  sacrificing truth and nature for the sake of ideal beauty and artistic  effect.    I cannot conclude this Preface without expressing my thanks to Messrs.  ADLARD for the first-rate style in which this volume has been printed;  particularly for the successful manner in which the impressions of the  engravings have been produced, superior, in general, to India-proof  impressions.        _King Street, Camden Town;_      _May, 1851._          ADDENDUM.    PENNANT--BUFFON--GOLDSMITH--BEWICK--BINGLEY.      In addition to the critical remarks on the writings of others, on this  subject, which the reader will find in the following pages, I have  further to observe that, although Pennant and Buffon have held a very  high character, for many years, as scientific naturalists, the portion  of their works which treats of the _Genus Bos_, appears to have been the  result of the most careless and superficial observation. With the  exception of the facts and observations furnished by such men as  Daubenton and Pallas, Buffon's works are little more than flimsy  speculations. As to Pennant's history of the Ox Tribe, it is calculated  rather to bewilder than to inform; it is, in fact, an incoherent mass of  dubious statements, huddled together in a most inextricable confusion:  as a piece of Natural History it is absolutely worse than nothing.    Goldsmith, Bewick, and Bingley, three of our most popular writers on  Natural History, appear to have done little more than compile from  Pennant and Buffon, and consequently are but little deserving of credit.  These strictures apply exclusively to such portions of their works as  relate to the Ox Tribe.          TABLE OF CONTENTS.

Of Scientific Names         2. General        I. ORIGIN OF THE WORK.      About a generation ago Mr. Matthew Arnold twitted our nation  with the fact that \"the journeyman work of literature\" was much  better done in France--the books of reference, the biographical  dictionaries, and the translations from the classics.  He did  not especially mention dictionaries of the language, because he  was speaking in praise of academies, and, as far as France is  concerned, the great achievement in that line is Littre and not  the Academy's Dictionary.  But the reproach has now been rolled  away--<i>nous avons change tout cela</i>--and in every branch  to which Arnold alluded our journeyman work is quite equal to  anything in France.    It is generally allowed that a vast improvement has taken place  in translations, whether prose or verse.  From quarter to  quarter the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> continues  its stately progress.  But the noblest monument of English  scholarship is <i>The New English Dictionary on Historical  Principles</i>, founded mainly on the materials collected by  the Philological Society, edited by Dr. James Murray, and  published at the cost of the University of Oxford.  The name  <i>New</i> will, however, be unsuitable long before the  Dictionary is out of date.  Its right name is the <i>Oxford  English Dictionary</i> (`O.E.D.').  That great dictionary is  built up out of quotations specially gathered for it from  English books of all kinds and all periods; and Dr. Murray  several years ago invited assistance from this end of the world  for words and uses of words peculiar to Australasia, or to  parts of it.  In answer to his call I began to collect; but  instances of words must be noted as one comes across them, and  of course they do not occur in alphabetical order.  The work  took time, and when my parcel of quotations had grown into a  considerable heap, it occurred to me that the collection, if a  little further trouble were expended upon it, might first enjoy  an independent existence.  Various friends kindly contributed  more quotations: and this Book is the result.    In January 1892, having the honour to be President of the  Section of \"Literature and the Fine Arts\" at the Hobart Meeting  of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,  I alluded to Dr. Murray's request:    A body like this Section, composed of men from different parts  of scattered colonies, might render valuable help in organising  the work of collecting authorities for our various peculiar  words and usages.  Twenty or thirty men and women, each  undertaking to read certain books with the new dictionary in  mind, and to note in a prescribed fashion what is peculiar,  could accomplish all that is needed.  Something has been done  in Melbourne, but the Colonies have different words and uses of  words, and this work is of a kind which might well extend  beyond the bounds of a single city.  At first it may seem as if  our words were few, as if in the hundred years of Australian  life few special usages have arisen; but a man with a  philological turn of mind, who notes what he hears, will soon  find the list grow.  Some philologers speak, not perhaps very  satisfactorily, of being \"at the fountains of language\": we can  all of us testify to the birth of some words within our own  memory, but the origin of these, if not noted, will in time be  lost.  There are many other words which the strictest cannot  condemn as slang, though even slang, being the speech of the  people, is not undeserving of some scientific study; words, for  instance, which have come into the language from the  Aborigines, and names of animals, shrubs, and flowers.  It  might even be possible, with sufficient co-operation, to  produce an Australian dictionary on the same lines as the  <i>New English Dictionary</i> by way of supplement to it.  Organisation might make the labour light, whilst for many it  would from its very nature prove a pleasant task.    These suggestions were not carried out.  Individuals sent  quotations to Oxford, but no organisation was established to  make the collection systematic or complete, and at the next  meeting of the Association the Section had ceased to exist,  or at least had doffed its literary character.    At a somewhat later date, Messrs. Funk and Wagnall of New York  invited me to join an \"Advisory Committee on disputed spelling  and pronunciation.\"  That firm was then preparing its  <i>Standard Dictionary</i>, and one part of the scheme was to  obtain opinions as to usage from various parts of the  English-speaking world, especially from those whose function it  is to teach the English Language.  Subsequently, at my own  suggestion, the firm appointed me to take charge of the  Australian terms in their Dictionary, and I forwarded a certain  number of words and phrases in use in Australia.  But the  accident of the letter A, for Australian, coming early in the  alphabet gives my name a higher place than it deserves on the  published list of those co-operating in the production of this  <i>Standard Dictionary</i>; for with my present knowledge I see  that my contribution was lamentably incomplete.  Moreover, I  joined the Editorial Corps too late to be of real use.  Only  the final proofs were sent to me, and although my corrections  were reported to New York without delay, they arrived too late  for any alterations to be effected before the sheets went to  press.  This took the heart out of my work for that Dictionary.  For its modernness, for many of its lexicographical features,  and for its splendid illustrations, I entertain a cordial  admiration for the book, and I greatly regret the unworthiness  of my share in it.  It is quite evident that others had  contributed Australasian words, and I must confess I hardly  like to be held responsible for some of their statements.  For  instance--     \"<i>Aabec</i>.  An Australian medicinal bark said to promote  perspiration.\"    I have never heard of it, and my ignorance is shared by the  greatest Australian botanist, the Baron von Mueller.    \"<i>Beauregarde</i>.  The Zebra grass-parrakeet of Australia.  From F. beau, regarde.  See BEAU n. and REGARD.\"    As a matter of fact, the name is altered out of recognition,  but really comes from the aboriginal <i>budgery</i>, good, and  <i>gar</i>, parrot.    \"<i>Imou-pine</i>.  A large New Zealand tree. . . . called  <i>red pine</i> by the colonists and <i>rimu</i> by the  natives.\"    I can find no trace of the spelling \"Imou.\"  In a circular to  New Zealand newspapers I asked whether it was a known variant.  The <i>New Zealand Herald</i> made answer--\"He may be sure that  the good American dictionary has made a misprint.  It was  scarcely worth the Professor's while to take notice of mere  examples of pakeha ignorance of Maori.\"    \"Swagman. [Slang, Austral.] 1. A dealer in cheap trinkets, etc.  2. A swagger.\"    In twenty-two years of residence in Australia, I have never heard  the former sense.    \"<i>Taihoa</i>. [Anglo-Tasmanian.]  No hurry; wait.\"    The word is Maori, and Maori is the language of New Zealand, not  of Tasmania.    These examples, I know, are not fair specimens of the accuracy  of the Standard Dictionary, but they serve as indications of  the necessity for a special book on Australasian English.        II.  TITLE AND SCOPE OF THE BOOK.      In the present day, when words are more and more abbreviated,  a \"short title\" may be counted necessary to the welfare of a  book.  For this reason \"Austral English\" has been selected.  In its right place in the dictionary the word <i>Austral</i>  will be found with illustrations to show that its primary meaning,  \"southern,\" is being more and more limited, so that the word  may now be used as equivalent to <i>Australasian</i>.    \"Austral\" or \"Australasian English\" means all the new words and  the new uses of old words that have been added to the English  language by reason of the fact that those who speak English  have taken up their abode in Australia, Tasmania, and New  Zealand.  Hasty inference might lead to the remark that such  addition is only slang, but the remark is far from being  accurate; probably not one-tenth of the new vocabulary could  fairly be so classified.  A great deal of slang is used in  Australasia, but very much less is generated here than is  usually believed.  In 1895 a literary policeman in Melbourne  brought out a small <i>Australian Slang Dictionary</i>.  In  spite of the name, however, the compiler confesses that \"very  few of the terms it contains have been invented by  Australians.\"  My estimate is that not one word in fifty in his  little book has an Australian origin, or even a specially  Australian use.    The phrase \"Australasian English\" includes something much wider  than slang.  Those who, speaking the tongue of Shakspeare, of  Milton, and of Dr. Johnson, came to various parts of  Australasia, found "]]]
