For in truth neither Marie  Leroux, widow of Jacques Constantin, nor her accomplice, Claude  Perregaud, was of sufficient importance to find a place on any list of  great criminals, although it is certain that they were guilty of the  crimes with which they were charged. It may seem strange that what  follows is more a history of the retribution which overtook the  criminals than a circumstantial description of the deeds for which they  were punished; but the crimes were so revolting, and so unsuitable for  discussion, that it was impossible for us to enter into any details on  the subject, so that what we offer in these pages is, we confess quite  openly, not a full, true, and particular account of a certain series of  events leading up to a certain result; it is not even a picture wherein  that result is depicted with artistic completeness, it is only an  imperfect narrative imperfectly rounded off. We feel sure, however, that  the healthy-minded reader will be grateful for our reticence and total  disregard of proportion. In spite of the disadvantage which such a theme  imposes on any writer with a deep sense of responsibility, we have  resolved to let in some light on these obscure figures; for we can  imagine no more effective way of throwing into high relief the low  morals and deep corruption into which all classes of society had sunk at  the termination of the factious dissensions of the Fronde, which formed  such a fitting prelude to the licence of the reign of the grand roi.    After this explanation, we shall, without further preamble, introduce  the reader to a little tavern in Paris, situated in the rue  Saint-Andre-des-Arts, on an evening in November 1658.    It was about seven o'clock. Three gentlemen were seated at one of the  tables in a low, smoky room. They had already emptied several bottles,  and one of them seemed to have just suggested some madcap scheme to the  others, the thought of which sent them off into shouts of laughter.    \"Pardu!\" said one of them, who was the first to recover his breath, \"I  must say it would be an excellent trick.\"    \"Splendid!\" said another; \"and if you like, Commander de Jars, we can  try it this very evening.\"    \"All right, my worthy king's treasurer, provided my pretty nephew here  won't be too much shocked,\" and as he spoke de Jars gave to the youngest  of the three a caressing touch on the cheek with the back of his hand.    \"That reminds me, de Jars!\" said the treasurer, \"that word you have just  said piques my curiosity. For some months now this little fellow here,  Chevalier de Moranges, follows you about everywhere like your shadow.  You never told us you had a nephew. Where the devil did you get him?\"    The commander touched the chevalier's knee under the table, and he, as  if to avoid speaking, slowly filled and emptied his glass.    \"Look here,\" said the treasurer, \"do you want to hear a few plain words,  such as I shall rap out when God takes me to task about the peccadilloes  of my past life? I don't believe a word about the relationship. A nephew  must be the son of either a brother or a sister. Now, your only sister  is an abbess, and your late brother's marriage was childless. There is  only one way of proving the relationship, and that is to confess that  when your brother was young and wild he and Love met, or else Madame  l'Abbesse----.\"    \"Take care, Treasurer Jeannin! no slander against my sister!\"    \"Well, then, explain; you can't fool me! May I be hanged if I leave this  place before I have dragged the secret out of you! Either we are friends  or we are not. What you tell no one else you ought to tell me. What!  would you make use of my purse and my sword on occasion and yet have  secrets from me? It's too bad: speak, or our friendship is at an end! I  give you fair warning that I shall find out everything and publish it  abroad to court and city: when I strike a trail there's no turning me  aside. It will be best for you to whisper your secret voluntarily into  my ear, where it will be as safe as in the grave.\"    \"How full of curiosity you are, my good friend!\" said de Jars, leaning  one elbow on the table, and twirling the points of his moustache with  his hand; \"but if I were to wrap my secret round the point of a dagger  would you not be too much afraid of pricking your fingers to pull it  off?\"    \"Not I,\" said the king's treasurer, beginning to twirl his moustache  also: \"the doctors have always told me that I am of too full a  complexion and that it would do me all the good in the world to be bled  now and then. But what would be an advantage to me would be dangerous to  you. It's easy to see from your jaundiced phiz that for you  blood-letting is no cure.\"    \"And you would really go that length? You would risk a duel if I refused  to let you get to the bottom of my mystery?\"    \"Yes, on my honour! Well, how is it to be?\"    \"My dear boy,\" said de Jars to the youth, \"we are caught, and may as  well yield gracefully. You don't know this big fellow as well as I do.  He's obstinacy itself. You can make the most obstinate donkey go on by  pulling its tail hard enough, but when Jeannin gets a notion into his  pate, not all the legions of hell can get it out again. Besides that,  he's a skilful fencer, so there's nothing for it but to trust him.\"    \"Just as you like,\" said the young man; \"you know all my circumstances  and how important it is that my secret should be kept.\"    \"Oh! among Jeannin's many vices there are a few virtues, and of these  discretion is the greatest, so that his curiosity is harmless. A quarter  of an hour hence he will let himself be killed rather than reveal what  just now he is ready to risk his skin to find out, whether we will or  no.\"    Jeannin nodded approvingly, refilled the glasses, and raising his to his  lips, said in a tone of triumph--    \"I am listening, commander.\"    \"Well, if it must be, it must. First of all, learn that my nephew is not  my nephew at all.\"    \"Go on.\"    \"That his name is not Moranges.\"    \"And the next?\"    \"I am not going to reveal his real name to you.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Because I don't know it myself, and no more does the chevalier.\"    \"What' nonsense!\"    \"No nonsense at all, but the sober truth. A few months ago the chevalier  came to Paris, bringing me a letter of introduction from a German whom I  used to know years ago. This letter requested me to look after the  bearer and help him in his investigations. As you said just now, Love  and someone once met somewhere, and that was about all was known as to  his origin. Naturally the young man wants to cut a figure in the world,  and would like to discover the author of his existence, that he may have  someone at hand to pay the debts he is going to incur. We have brought  together every scrap of information we could collect as to this person,  hoping to find therein a clue that we could follow up. To be quite open  with you, and convince you at the same time how extremely prudent and  discreet we must be, I must tell you that we think we have found one,  and that it leads to no less a dignitary than a Prince of the Church.  But if he should get wind of our researches too soon everything would be  at an end, don't you see? So keep your tongue between your teeth.\"    \"Never fear,\" said Jeannin.    \"Now, that's what I call speaking out as a friend should. I wish you  luck, my gallant Chevalier de Moranges, and until you unearth your  father, if you want a little money, my purse is at your service. On my  word, de Jars, you must have been born with a caul. There never was your  equal for wonderful adventures. This one promises well-spicy intrigues,  scandalous revelations, and you'll be in the thick of it all. You're a  lucky fellow! It's only a few months since you had the most splendid  piece of good fortune sent you straight from heaven. A fair lady falls  in love with you and makes you carry her off from the convent of La  Raquette. But why do you never let anyone catch a glimpse of her? Are  you jealous? Or is it that she is no such beauty, after all, but old and  wrinkled, like that knave of a Mazarin?\"    \"I know what I'm about,\" answered de Jars, smiling; \"I have my very good  reasons. The elopement caused a great deal of indignation, and it's not  easy to get fanatics to listen to common sense. No, I am not in the  least jealous; she is madly in love with me. Ask my nephew.\"    \"Does he know her?\"    \"We have no secrets from each other; the confidence between us is  without a flaw. The fair one, believe me, is good to look on, and is  worth all the ogling, fan-flirting baggages put together that one sees  at court or on the balconies of the Palais Roy: ah! I'll answer for  that. Isn't she, Moranges?\"    \"I'm quite of your opinion,\" said the youth; exchanging with de jars a  singularly significant look; \"and you had better treat her well, uncle,  or I shall play you some trick.\"    \"Ah! ah!\" cried Jeannin. \"You poor fellow! I very much fear that you are  warming a little serpent in your bosom. Have an eye to this dandy with  the beardless chin! But joking apart, my boy, are you really on good  terms with the fair lady?\"    \"Certainly I am.\"    \"And you are not uneasy, commander?\"    \"Not the least little bit.\"    \"He is quite right. I answer for her as for my self,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#1)"],[1,"*JOAN OF NAPLES*                                      _By_                            *Alexandre Dumas, Pere*             _From the set in Eight Volumes of \"Celebrated Crimes\"_                                        1910          CONTENTS          *JOAN OF NAPLES--1343-1382*      CHAPTER I      CHAPTER II      CHAPTER III      CHAPTER IV      CHAPTER V      CHAPTER VI      CHAPTER VII      CHAPTER VIII          *JOAN OF NAPLES--1343-1382*          CHAPTER I      In the night of the 15th of January 1343, while the inhabitants of  Naples lay wrapped in peaceful slumber, they were suddenly awakened by  the bells of the three hundred churches that this thrice blessed capital  contains. In the midst of the disturbance caused by so rude a call the  first thought in the mind of all was that the town was on fire, or that  the army of some enemy had mysteriously landed under cover of night and  could put the citizens to the edge of the sword. But the doleful,  intermittent sounds of all these fills, which disturbed the silence at  regular and distant intervals, were an invitation to the faithful to  pray for a passing soul, and it was soon evident that no disaster  threatened the town, but that the king alone was in danger.    Indeed, it had been plain for several days past that the greatest  uneasiness prevailed in Castel Nuovo; the officers of the crown were  assembled regularly twice a day, and persons of importance, whose right  it was to make their way into the king's apartments, came out evidently  bowed down with grief. But although the king's death was regarded as a  misfortune that nothing could avert, yet the whole town, on learning for  certain of the approach of his last hour, was affected with a sincere  grief, easily understood when one learns that the man about to die,  after a reign of thirty-three years, eight months, and a few days, was  Robert of Anjou, the most wise, just, and glorious king who had ever sat  on the throne of Sicily. And so he carried with him to the tomb the  eulogies and regrets of all his subjects.    Soldiers would speak with enthusiasm of the long wars he had waged with  Frederic and Peter of Aragon, against Henry VII and Louis of Bavaria;  and felt their hearts beat high, remembering the glories of campaigns in  Lombardy and Tuscany; priests would gratefully extol his constant  defence of the papacy against Ghibelline attacks, and the founding of  convents, hospitals, and churches throughout his kingdom; in the world  of letters he was regarded as the most learned king in Christendom;  Petrarch, indeed, would receive the poet's crown from no other hand, and  had spent three consecutive days answering all the questions that Robert  had deigned to ask him on every topic of human knowledge. The men of  law, astonished by the wisdom of those laws which now enriched the  Neapolitan code, had dubbed him the Solomon of their day; the nobles  applauded him for protecting their ancient privileges, and the people  were eloquent of his clemency, piety, and mildness. In a word, priests  and soldiers, philosophers and poets, nobles and peasants, trembled when  they thought that the government was to fall into the hands of a  foreigner and of a young girl, recalling those words of Robert, who, as  he followed in the funeral train of Charles, his only son, turned as he  reached the threshold of the church and sobbingly exclaimed to his  barons about him, \"This day the crown has fallen from my head: alas for  me! alas for you!\"    Now that the bells were ringing for the dying moments of the good king,  every mind was full of these prophetic words: women prayed fervently to  God; men from all parts of the town bent their steps towards the royal  palace to get the earliest and most authentic news, and after waiting  some moments, passed in exchanging sad reflections, were obliged to  return as they had come, since nothing that went on in the privacy of  the family found its way outside--the castle was plunged in complete  darkness, the drawbridge was raised as usual, and the guards were at  their post.    Yet if our readers care to be present at the death of the nephew of  Saint Louis and the grandson of Charles of Anjou, we may conduct them  into the chamber of the dying man. An alabaster lamp suspended from the  ceiling serves to light the vast and sombre room, with walls draped in  black velvet sewn with golden fleur-de-lys. Near the wall which faces  the two entrance doors that at this moment are both shut close, there  stands beneath a brocaded canopy an ebony bed, supported on four twisted  columns carved with symbolic figures. The king, after a struggle with a  violent paroxysm, has fallen swooning in the arms of his confessor and  his doctor, who each hold one of his dying hands, feeling his pulse  anxiously and exchanging looks of intelligence. At the foot of the bed  stands a woman about fifty years of age, her hands clasped, her eyes  raised to heaven, in an attitude of resigned grief: this woman is the  queen, No tears dim her eyes: her sunken cheek has that waxen yellow  tinge that one sees on the bodies of saints preserved by miracle. In her  look is that mingling of calm and suffering that points to a soul at  once tried by sorrow and imbued with religion. After the lapse of an  hour, while no movement had disturbed the profound silence which reigned  about the bed of death, the king trembled slightly; opened his eyes, and  endeavoured feebly to raise his head. They thanking the physician and  priest with a smile, who had both hastened to arrange his pillows, he  begged the queen to come near, and told her in a low voice that he would  speak with her a moment alone. The doctor and confessor retired, deeply  bowing, and the king followed them with his eyes up to the moment when  one of the doors closed behind them. He passed his hand across his brow,  as though seeking to collect his thoughts, and rallying all his forces  for the supreme effort, pronounced these words:    \"What I must say to you, Sancha, has no concern with those two good  persons who were here a moment ago: their task is ended. One has done  all for my body that human science could teach him, and all that has  come of it is that my death is yet a little deferred; the other has now  absolved me of all my sins, and assured me of God's forgiveness, yet  cannot keep from me those dread apparitions which in this terrible hour  arise before me. Twice have you seen me battling with a superhuman  horror. My brow has been bathed in sweat, my limbs rigid, my cries have  been stifled by a hand of iron. Has God permitted the Evil Spirit to  tempt me? Is this remorse in phantom shape? These two conflicts I have  suffered have so subdued my strength that I can never endure a third.  Listen then, my Sandra, for I have instructions to give you on which  perhaps the safety of my soul depends.\"    \"My lord and my master,\" said the queen in the most gentle accents of  submission, \"I am ready to listen to your orders; and should it be that  God, in the hidden designs of His providence, has willed to call you to  His glory while we are plunged in grief, your last wishes shall be  fulfilled here on earth most scrupulously and exactly. But,\" she added,  with all the solicitude of a timid soul, \"pray suffer me to sprinkle  drops of holy water and banish the accursed one from this chamber, and  let me offer up some part of that service of prayer that you composed in  honour of your sainted brother to implore God's protection in this hour  when we can ill afford to lose it.\"    Then opening a richly bound book, she read with fervent devotion certain  verses of the office that Robert had written in a very pure Latin for  his brother Louis, Bishop of Toulouse, which was in use in the Church as  late as the time of the Council of Trent.    Soothed by the charm of the prayers he had himself composed, the king  was near forgetting the object of the interview he had so solemnly and  eagerly demanded and letting himself lapse into a state of vague  melancholy, he murmured in a subdued voice, \"Yes, yes, you are right;  pray for me, for you too are a saint, and I am but a poor sinful man.\"    \"Say not so, my lord,\" interrupted Dona Sancha; \"you are the greatest,  wisest, and most just king who has ever sat upon the throne of Naples.\"    \"But the throne is usurped,\" replied Robert in a voice of gloom; \"you  know that the kingdom belonged to my elder brother, Charles Martel; and  since Charles was on the throne of Hungary, which he inherited from his  mother, the kingdom of Naples devolved by right upon his eldest son,  Carobert, and not on me, who am the third in rank of the family. And I  have suffered myself to be crowned in my nephew's stead, though he was  the only lawful-king; I have put the younger branch in the place of the  elder, and for thirty-three years I have stifled the reproaches of my  conscience. True, I have won battles, made laws, founded churches; but a  single word serves to give the lie to all the pompous titles showered  upon me by the people's admiration, and this one word rings out clearer  in my ears than all the flattery of courtiers, all the songs of poets,  all the orations of the crowd:--I am an usurper!\"    \"Be not unjust towards yourself, my lord, and bear in mind that if you  did not abdicate in favour of the rightful heir, it was because you  wished to save the people from the worst misfortunes. Moreover,\"  continued the queen, with that air of profound conviction that an  unanswerable argument inspires, \"you have remained king by the consent  and authority of our Holy Father the sovereign pontiff, who disposes of  the throne as a fief belonging to the Church.\"    \"I have long quieted my scruples thus,\" replied the dying man, \"and the  pope's authority has kept me silent; but whatever security one may  pretend to feel in one's lifetime, there yet comes a dreadful solemn  hour when all illusions needs must vanish:"]]]
