In preparing this History, I make no claim to original and profound  investigations; but the arrangement, the style, and the sentiments,  are my own. I have simply attempted to condense the great and varied  subjects which are presented, so as to furnish a connected narrative  of what is most vital in the history of the last three hundred years,  avoiding both minute details and elaborate disquisitions. It has been  my aim to write a book, which should be neither a chronological table  nor a philosophical treatise, but a work adapted to the wants of young  people in the various stages of education, and which, it is hoped,  will also prove interesting to those of maturer age; who have not the  leisure to read extensive works, and yet who wish to understand the  connection of great events since the Protestant Reformation. Those  characters, institutions, reforms, and agitations, which have had the  greatest influence in advancing society, only have been described, and  these not to the extent which will satisfy the learned or the curious.  Dates and names, battles and sieges, have not been disregarded; but  more attention has been given to those ideas and to those men by whose  influence and agency great changes have taken place. In a work so  limited, and yet so varied, marginal references to original  authorities have not been deemed necessary; but a list of standard and  accessible authors is furnished, at the close of each chapter, which  the young student, seeking more minute information, can easily  consult. A continuation of this History to the present time might seem  desirable; but it would be difficult to condense the complicated  events of the last thirty years into less than another volume. Instead  of an unsatisfactory compend, especially of subjects concerning which  there are great differences of opinion, and considerable warmth of  feeling, useful tables of important events are furnished in the  Appendix. I have only to add, that if I have succeeded in remedying,  in some measure, the defects of those dry compendiums, which are used  for want of living histories; if I have combined what is instructive  with what is entertaining; and especially if I shall impress the  common mind, even to a feeble degree, with those great moral truths  which history ought to teach, I shall feel that my agreeable labor is  not without its reward.

BY  EDWIN SIDNEY HARTLAND,  FELLOW OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES.      LONDON:  WALTER SCOTT,  24, WARWICK LANE, PATERNOSTER ROW.  1891.          PREFACE.      The chief object of this volume is to exhibit, in a manner acceptable to  readers who are not specialists, the application of the principles and  methods which guide investigations into popular traditions to a few of  the most remarkable stories embodying the Fairy superstitions of the  Celtic and Teutonic peoples. Some of the subjects discussed have already  been dealt with by more competent inquirers. But even in these cases I  have sometimes been able to supply additional illustrations of the  conclusions previously arrived at, and occasionally, I hope, to carry  the argument a step or two further than had been done before. I have  thus tried to render the following pages not wholly valueless to  students.    A portion of the book incorporates the substance of some articles which  I contributed to \"The Archaeological Review\" and \"Folk-Lore.\" But these  have been to a considerable extent re-written; and it is hoped that in  the process wider and more accurate generalizations have been attained.    My hearty thanks are due to the various friends whose generous  assistance has been recorded in the footnotes, and especially to  Professor Dr. George Stephens, the veteran antiquary of the North, and  Mr. W. G. Fretton, who have not measured their pains on behalf of one  whose only claim on them was a common desire to pry into the recesses of  the past. I am under still deeper obligations to Mr. G. L. Gomme,  F.S.A., who has so readily acceded to my request that he would read the  proof-sheets, and whose suggestions have repeatedly been of the greatest  value; and to Mr. Havelock Ellis for the counsel and suggestions which  his experience has more than once enabled him to give as the book was  passing through the press.    I have been anxious to enable the reader who cares to do so to verify  every statement made; but some of them no doubt have escaped reference.  Many books are cited again and again, and in similar cases the reader's  time is frequently wasted in searching for the first mention of a book,  so as to ascertain its title and other particulars. To avoid the trouble  I have so many times experienced in this way, I have put together in an  Appendix a list of the principal authorities made use of, indicating  them by the short title by which they are cited in the footnotes, and  giving sufficient bibliographical details to enable them to be  identified. Classics and works which are in every one's hands I have not  thought it necessary to include in the list.    E. S. H.

CHAPTER I.    THE ART OF STORY-TELLING.         The art of story-telling--Unity of human imagination--Definition       of Fairy Tales--Variable value of Tradition--Story-telling and       the story-teller among various peoples--The connection of       folk-tales with folk-songs--Continuity of Tradition--Need of       accuracy and good faith in reporting stories.      The art of story-telling has been cultivated in all ages and among all  nations of which we have any record; it is the outcome of an instinct  implanted universally in the human mind. By means of a story the savage  philosopher accounts for his own existence and that of all the phenomena  which surround him. With a story the mothers of the wildest tribes awe  their little ones into silence, or rouse them into delight. And the  weary hunters beguile the long silence of a desert night with the mirth  and wonders of a tale. The imagination is not less fruitful in the  higher races; and, passing through forms sometimes more, sometimes less,  serious, the art of story-telling unites with the kindred arts of dance  and song to form the epic or the drama, or develops under the complex  influences of modern life into the prose romance and the novel. These in  their various ways are its ultimate expression; and the loftiest genius  has found no fitter vehicle to convey its lessons of truth and beauty.    But even in the most refined products of the imagination the same  substances are found which compose the rudest. Something has, of course,  been dropped in the process; and where we can examine the process stage  by stage, we can discern the point whereat each successive portion has  been purged away. But much has also been gained. To change the figure,  it is like the continuous development of living things, amorphous at  first, by and by shooting out into monstrous growths, unwieldy and  half-organized, anon settling into compact and beautiful shapes of  subtlest power and most divine suggestion. But the last state contains  nothing more than was either obvious or latent in the first. Man's  imagination, like every other known power, works by fixed laws, the  existence and operation of which it is possible to trace; and it works  upon the same material,--the external universe, the mental and moral  constitution of man and his social relations. Hence, diverse as may seem  at first sight the results among the cultured Europeans and the debased  Hottentots, the philosophical Hindoos and the Red Indians of the Far  West, they present, on a close examination, features absolutely  identical. The outlines of a story-plot among savage races are wilder  and more unconfined; they are often a vast unhidebound corpse, but one  that bears no distant resemblance to forms we think more reasonable only  because we find it difficult to let ourselves down to the level of  savage ignorance, and to lay aside the data of thought which have been  won for us by the painful efforts of civilization. The incidents, making  all due allowance for these differences and those of climate and  physical surroundings, are not merely alike; they are often  indistinguishable. It cannot, of course, be expected that the characters  of the actors in these stories will be drawn with skill, or indeed that  any attention will be paid to them. Character-study is a late  development. True: we ought not to overlook the fact that we have to do  with barbarous ideals. In a rudimentary state of civilization the  passions, like the arts, are distinguished not by subtlety and  complexity, but by simplicity and violence of contrast. This may account  to some extent for what seems to us repulsive, inconsistent or  impossible. But we must above all things beware of crediting the  story-teller with that degree of conscious art which is only possible in  an advanced culture and under literary influences. Indeed, the  researches which are constantly extending the history of human  civilization into a remoter and remoter past, go everywhere to show that  story-telling is an inevitable and wholly unconscious growth, probably  arising, as we shall see in the next chapter, out of narratives believed  to record actual events.    I need not stop now to illustrate this position, which is no new one,  and the main lines of which I hope will be rendered apparent in the  course of this volume. But it is necessary, perhaps, to point out that,  although these are the premises from which I start, the limitations  imposed by a work of the size and pretensions of this one will not allow  me to traverse more than a very small corner of the field here opened to  view. It is, therefore, not my intention to attempt any formal proof of  the foregoing generalizations. Rather I hope that if any reader deem it  proper to require the complete evidence on which they rest, he will be  led to further investigations on his own behalf. His feet, I can promise  him, will wander along flowery paths, where every winding will bring him  fresh surprises, and every step discover new sources of enjoyment.    The stories with which we shall deal in the following pages are vaguely  called Fairy Tales. These we may define to be: Traditionary narratives  not in their present form relating to beings held to be divine, nor to  cosmological or national events, but in which the supernatural plays an  essential part. It will be seen that literary tales, such as those of  Hans Andersen and Lord Brabourne, based though they often are upon  tradition, are excluded from Fairy Tales as thus defined. Much no doubt  might be said both interesting and instructive"]]]
