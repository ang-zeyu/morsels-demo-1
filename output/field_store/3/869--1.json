For the time is about 1640, and there is a move afoot in the  country of England to do away with the monarchy.  In the castle most of  its old defences have not been used for many years, perhaps centuries,  and old Ben Martlet sets about restoring them, cleaning up the armour,  teaching young Roy the arts of self-defence, by putting him through a  course of fencing, by restoring the portcullis and draw-bridge, and by  training the men from the neighbouring farms to be soldiers.    But eventually, through treachery, the Roundheads, as those who oppose  the monarchy, are called, manage to take the castle, and to make Roy and  his mother, along with old Ben Martlet and the other defenders,  prisoner.  This can't do the management of the tenant farms much good.    Eventually Sir Granby, Roy's father, appears on the scene, and the  Roundheads are chased away.  As we know from our history books, the  Monarchy was restored, and peace spreads again through the land of  England.    ________________________________________________________________________  THE YOUNG CASTELLAN, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.        CHAPTER ONE.    IN THE OLD ARMOURY.    \"See these here spots o' red rust, Master Roy?\"    \"I should be blind as poor old Jenkin if I couldn't, Ben.\"    \"Ay, that you would, sir.  Poor old Jenk, close upon ninety he be; and  that's another thing.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said the boy addressed.    \"What do I mean, sir?  Why, I mean as that's another thing as shows as  old England's wore out, and rustin' and moulderin' away.\"    \"Is this Dutch or English, Ben?\" said the manly-looking boy, who had  just arrived at the age when dark lads get teased about not having  properly washed the sides of their faces and their upper lips, which  begin to show traces of something \"coming up.\"  \"I don't understand.\"    \"English, sir,\" said the weather-beaten speaker, a decidedly ugly man of  about sixty, grizzly of hair and beard, deeply-lined of countenance, and  with a peculiar cicatrice extending from the upper part of his left  cheek-bone diagonally down to the right corner of his lips, and making  in its passage a deep notch across his nose.  \"English, sir; good old  honest English.\"    \"You're always grumbling, Ben, and you won't get the rust off that  morion with that.\"    \"That I shan't, sir; and if I uses elber grease and sand, it'll only  come again.  But it's all a sign of poor old England rustin' and  moulderin' away.  The idea!  And at a place like this.  Old Jenk, as  watch at the gate tower, and not got eyes enough to see across the moat,  and even that's getting full o' mud!\"    \"Well, you wouldn't have father turn the poor old man away because he's  blind and worn-out.\"    \"Not I, sir,\" said the man, moistening a piece of flannel with oil,  dipping it into some fine white sand, and then proceeding to scrub away  at the rust spots upon the old helmet, which he now held between his  knees; while several figures in armour, ranged down one side of the low,  dark room in which the work was being carried on, seemed to be looking  on and waiting to have their rust removed in turn.    \"Then what do you mean?\" said the boy.    \"I mean, Master Roy, as it's a pity to see the old towers going down  hill as they are.\"    \"But they're not,\" cried the boy.    \"Not, sir?  Well, if you'll excuse me for saying as you're wrong, I'll  say it.  Where's your garrison? where's your horses? and where's your  guns, and powder, and shot, and stores?\"    \"Fudge, then!  We don't want any garrison nowadays, and as for horses,  why, it was a sin to keep 'em in those old underground stables that used  to be their lodging.  Any one would think you expected to have some one  come and lay siege to the place.\"    \"More unlikely things than that, Master Roy.  We live in strange times,  and the king may get the worst of it any day.\"    \"Oh, you old croaker!\" cried Roy.  \"I believe you'd like to have a lot  more men in the place, and mount guard, and go on drilling and  practising with the big guns.\"    \"Ay, sir, I should; and with a place like this, it's what ought to be  done.\"    \"Well, it wouldn't be bad fun, Ben,\" said the boy, thoughtfully.    \"Fun, sir?  Don't you get calling serious work like that fun.--But look  ye there.  Soon chevy these spots off, don't I?\"    \"Yes, it's getting nice and bright,\" said Roy, gazing down at the steel  headpiece.    \"And it's going to get brighter and better before I've done.  I'm going  to let Sir Granby see when he comes back that I haven't neglected  nothing.  I'm a-going to polish up all on 'em in turn, beginning with  old Sir Murray Royland.  Let me see: he was your greatest grandfather,  wasn't he?\"    \"Yes, he lived in 1480,\" said the boy, as the old man rose, set down the  morion, and followed him to where the farthest suit of mail stood  against the wall.  \"I say, Ben, this must have been very heavy to wear.\"    \"Ay, sir, tidy; but, my word, it was fine for a gentleman in those days  to mount his horse, shining in the sun, and looking as noble as a man  could look.  He's a bit spotty, though, it's been so damp.  But I'll  begin with Sir Murray and go right down 'em all, doing the steeliest  ones first, and getting by degrees to the last on 'em as is only steel  half-way down, and the rest being boots.  Ah! it's a dolesome change  from Sir Murray to Sir Brian yonder at the end, and worse still, to your  father, as wouldn't put nothing on but a breast-piece and back-piece and  a steel cap.\"    \"Why, it's best,\" said the boy; \"steel armour isn't wanted so much now  they've got cannon and guns.\"    \"Ay, that's a sad come-down too, sir.  Why, even when I was out under  your grandfather, things were better and fighting fairer.  People tried  to see who was best man then with their swords.  Now men goes to hide  behind hedges and haystacks, to try and shoot you like they would a  hare.\"    \"Why, they did the same sort of thing with their bows and arrows, Ben,  and their cross-bows and bolts.\"    \"Well, maybe, sir; but that was a clean kind o' fighting, and none of  your sulphur and brimstone, and charcoal and smoke.\"    \"I say, Ben, it'll take you some time to get things straight.  Mean to  polish up the old swords and spears, too?\"    \"Every man jack of 'em, sir.  I mean to have this armoury so as your  father, when he comes back from scattering all that rabble, will look  round and give me a bit of encouragement.\"    \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the boy; \"so that's what makes you so industrious.\"    \"Nay it aren't, sir,\" said the man, with a reproachful shake of his  head.  \"I didn't mean money, Master Roy, but good words, and a sort o'  disposition to make the towers what they should be again.  He's a fine  soldier is your father, and I hear as the king puts a lot o' trust in  him; but it always seems to me as he thinks more about farming when he's  down here than he does about keeping up the old place as a good cavalier  should.\"    \"Don't you talk a lot of nonsense,\" said Roy, hotly; \"if my father likes  to live here as country gentlemen do, and enjoy sport and gardening and  farming, who has a better right to, I should like to know?\"    \"Oh, nobody, sir, nobody,\" said the man, scouring away at the rusted  steel.    \"And besides, times are altered.  When this castle was built, gentlemen  used to have to protect themselves, and kept their retainers to fight  for them.  Now there's a regular army, and the king does all that.\"    That patch of rust must have been a little lighter on, for the man  uttered a low grunt of satisfaction.    \"It would be absurd to make the towers just as they used to be, and shut  out the light and cover the narrow slits with iron bars.\"    \"Maybe, Master Roy; but Sir Granby might have the moat cleared of mud,  and kept quite full.\"    \"What!  I just hope it won't be touched.  Why, that would mean draining  it, and then what would become of my carp and tench?\"    \"Ketch 'em and put 'em in tubs, sir, and put some little uns back.\"    \"Yes, and then it would take years for them to grow, and all the  beautiful white and yellow water-lilies would be destroyed.\"    \"Yes; but see what a lot of fine, fat eels we should get, sir.  There's  some thumpers there.  I caught a four-pounder on a night-line last  week.\"    \"Ah, you did, did you?\" cried the lad; \"then don't you do it again  without asking for leave.\"    \"All right, sir, I won't; but you don't grudge an old servant like me  one eel?\"    \"Of course I don't, Ben,\" said the lad, importantly; \"but the moat is  mine.  Father gave it to me as my own special fishing-place before he  went away, and I don't allow any one to fish there without my leave.\"    \"I'll remember, sir,\" said the man, beginning to whistle softly.    \"I don't grudge you a _few_ eels, Ben, and you shall have plenty; but  next time you want to fish, you ask.\"    \"Yes, sir, I will.\"    \"And what you say is all nonsense: the place is beautiful as it is.  Why, I believe if you could do as you liked, you'd turn my mother's  pleasaunce and the kitchen-garden into drill-grounds.\"    \"That I would, sir,\" said the man, flushing up.  \"The idea of a  beautiful square of ground, where the men might be drilled, and practise  with sword and gun, being used to grow cabbages in.  Er! it's horrid!\"    Roy laughed.    \"You're a rum fellow, Ben,\" he cried.  \"I believe you think that people  were meant to do nothing else but fight and kill one another.\"    \"Deal better than spending all their time over books, sir,\" said the  man; \"and you take my advice.  You said something to me about being a  statesman some day, and serving the king that way.  Now, I s'pose I  don't know exactly what a statesman is, but I expect it's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25452"],[0,"The Kangaroo Marines (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: Cover art]            The    Kangaroo Marines      By    CAPT.

Therefore, I hold no special  brief for the folks down under.  But I am an Imperialist--one filled  with admiration for our overseas Dominions and the self-sacrifice of  our colonial cousins.  They have played the game.  They have astonished  the world.  They have even exceeded our own expectations.  Let us not  stint our praise.  Let us write deep in the annals of our literature  and military history this supreme devotion, this noble heroism.  And in  the greater Councils of Empire let us see to it that these sons of the  Motherland have a say in settling affairs.    And I can claim at least the right to write about our gallant  Australasians.  I have lived in Australia and New Zealand.  I have  served on a Sydney paper and with the New Zealand _Herald_.  I have met  every Premier (Federal and otherwise), from \"Andrew\" Fisher to \"Bill\"  Massey.  And, during my stay, I made it my duty to study the Citizen  Army--a National Service organisation.    This was before the war.  And this army was founded by \"K\" and the  Governments of Australia and New Zealand.  Did they see ahead?  One is  almost tempted to think so.  In any case, the possession of a General  Staff and the framework of a National Army ensured the rapid  mobilisation of a voluntary force to assist the Motherland.  This force  was armed, clothed, equipped and staffed from the existing military  organisations in Australia and New Zealand.  You have heard of their  courage at Anzac; you have read of how many have died.    Anzac is the cope-stone of Imperialism.  It is the grim expression of a  faith that is everlasting, of a love that shall endure the shocks of  years, and all the cunning devilry of such as the Barbarous Huns.  Hence this little book.  It is an inspiration of the Dardanelles, where  I met many of our Australasian friends.  It is not an official history.  I have, in my own way, endeavoured to picture what like these warring  Bohemians are.  The cloak of fiction has here and there been wound  round temperamental things as well as around some glorious facts.    I hope I shall please all and offend none.    R. W.

Boosers, scrimshankers and loonies  barred.  Gents with big waists and little hearts are warned off.  Sharpshooters on the wallaby, able to live on condensed air and boiled  snakes, are cordially invited.  No parson's references are required.

This is to be the crack corps of the Australian Force.    Hurry up and join.    (_Signed_) SAM KILLEM, _Lt. Col. Commanding_.      This alluring advertisement appeared on the front page of _The  Bushmen's Weekly_, a Sydney production, renowned for its wit and  originality.  It was designed to tickle the sides of the horny-handed  men of the Bush, and to rope in the best of them.  For these men of the  Never-Never Land are soldiers born and heroes in the toughest job.  They think deep and know the way of things.  If they appear wild and  uncouth, they carry beneath that scrubby exterior the will of men and  the open heart of the child.    Moreover, they love the Motherland.  This was specially true of the  four who tenanted a little shanty on the sheep station of \"Old Graham,\"  one of the wealthiest men in Australia.  The quartette consisted of  Bill Buster, a typical Cornstalk with a nut-brown face, twinkling eyes  and a spice of the devil and the Lord in his soul.  Next came Claud  Dufair, a handsome remittance man with an eye-glass and a drawl.  This  fellow had personality.  He insisted on wearing a white collar and  using kid gloves when doing anything, from dung lifting to sheep  shearing.  Paddy Doolan was the third member.  He was an Irishman by  birth, but Australian by adoption.  He had been in the Bush since he  was a kid.  A kind soul was Paddy, with the usual weakness--the craving  for the \"cratur.\"  Fourth, and by no means least, was Sandy Brown, a  Glasgow stoker, who had skipped away in a tramp from the Broomielaw  because of another fellow's wife.    A mixed bunch, these four, you will agree.  All with a history, part of  it bad, but the main part certainly good.  It takes a good heart to be  a Bushman.  Work is hard, the heat is trying, pleasures few, and the  chances of wealth are only meagre.  But the Australian Bush has a lure  of its own.  It calls the bravest and the best.  It calls and holds the  men primed for adventure, unafraid of death, and full of that innate  charm and gallantry which is always the particular prerogative of the  wanderer.  No questions are asked in this land.  A man's soul is never  probed, nor is he expected to reveal his birth, or the cause of his  being there.  It is the place to hide a broken heart or mend an erring  past.  But it is only a place for men.  And this quartette was full of  the war.  They were itching to fight.  This advertisement, therefore,  cheered their hearts and clinched their hopes.    \"Well, boys,\" said Bill, \"this is our call.  We'd better join.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" remarked the others.  That was all.  They immediately  packed their swag for the road.  That afternoon they received their pay  from the squatter.  While Buster, Brown, and Doolan said good-bye to  the master and mistress on the veranda, Claud was kissing Sybil, the  charming daughter of the house, a tender farewell.  For Sybil Graham  loved the \"English Johnny,\" as her friends called Claud.  Her love was  returned--not in the way he had treated some women in England, but with  that reverence which is born out of true affection.  This Englishman,  despite his faults, had a veneration for the straightforward type which  can be found in the Australian squatter's home.    \"Come on, Claud--here's the coach,\" yelled Bill from the veranda.  They  embraced once more, then stepped out of doors.    \"Good-bye, boys--God bless you!\" said old Graham with a husky throat.    \"Good-bye--Good-bye!\" said his wife, with tears in her eyes, while  Sybil had only strength to wave her arm to the fast disappearing figure  of Claud as he drove with his friends to the railway station twenty  miles beyond.    \"You're queer lookin', Claud,\" said Sandy, as they went down the road.    \"Shut up!\" interjected Bill, who, like all Bushmen, had a true respect  for the sentiment inspired by the dangers of war.  However, the sadness  of parting was soon forgotten.  They were, also, cheered to see, coming  over the plains, little groups of cookies, shearers and others, bent on  their own errand.    \"Sakes alive! where's all you mad fellows goin'?\" inquired the wizened  old stationmaster.    \"Berlin,\" said Bill.    \"Ach sure, stationmaster, we're goin' to kiss the little darlints in  the Sultan's harem.\"    \"Well, hurry up, boys; the train's ready.\"    With a wild whoop fifty of them dashed for tickets, some \"tucker,\" and  a bottle or two of Scotch.  Into the train they jumped, and in a jiffy  were rolling over the line to Sydney.  Song and story helped to cheer  the long and somewhat tiring journey.  During a sort of lull in the  proceedings Claud looked up and said: \"Here, Bill, can't you recite us  some of that impromptu sort of doggerel that you get into the Sydney  weeklies now and then.\"    \"Well--yes,\" said Bill, rising and clearing his throat.    \"Order, order! ye sheep-eatin' blackguards,\" shouted Paddy, hitting a  table with his riding-whip.  The gathering ceased their chatter, and  Bill rhymed out:      \"We're the Kangaroo Marines,    We're not Lager-fed machines,      But Bushmen, Bushmen, Bushmen from the plains.    We can ride, and we can cook,    Ay, in shooting know our book,      We're out to wipe off Kaiser Billy's stains.      \"We're not trim--and not polite,    And, perchance, get on the skite--      We're Bushmen, Bushmen, Bushmen from the plains.    Yet though we can't salute,    We can bayonet and can boot      The wily, wily Turk from our domains.      \"So when we ride away,    Off hats and shout 'Hooray'      For Bushmen, Bushmen, Bushmen from the plains.    And, parsons, say your prayers    That we may pass \"Upstairs\"      Should a nasty little bullet hit our veins.      \"Now, boys, stand up and sing    God save our good old King,      And Bushmen, Bushmen, Bushmen from the plains.\"      \"Good, Bill, good!\" shouted Claud, gripping the rough rhymster by the  hand.    \"Hear, hear!\" shouted the crowd.    \"Rot!  D---- rotten jingo slush!  What the hades has the King done for  you and me?\" roared a red-faced passenger at the other end of the car.  This was none other than Bill Neverwork, secretary of the Weary  Willies' Union and Socialist M.P. for the town of Wearyville.    \"Go an' boil yer old fat 'ead!\" said Bill, calmly lighting his pipe.    \"Ye turnip-faced spalpeen, oi'll cut yer dirty thrapple wid my gully  knife.\"    \"Rot!\"    \"You beastly fellow!\" said Claud, giving him a scornful look.    But this Socialist gentleman was not to be denied.  He would speak.  \"Listen, boys,\" he roared above the"]]]
