Vol. II.    NEW-YORK, MARCH 1, 1851.    No. IV.    Transcriber's Note: Minor typos have been corrected and footnotes moved  to the end of the article.          AUSTEN HENRY LAYARD, LL. D.    [Illustration]      In an early number of the _International_ we had the satisfaction of  printing an original and very interesting letter from Dr. Layard, in  which, with more fulness and explicitness than in his great work on  Nineveh, he discusses the subject of Ancient Art. We have carefully  noted from time to time his proceedings in the East, and our readers  will remember that we recently gave engravings of the most remarkable of  the antiquities he sent home last year to the British Museum. Since that  time he has proceeded to Bagdad, and he is now pursuing in that  vicinity, with his wonted sagacity and earnestness, researches for the  remains of Babylon, which in turn will furnish material for another  extensive publication from his pen.    The first public announcement of the discoveries at Nimroud was made in  the _Knickerbocker Magazine_ of this city, in a letter from our  countryman, Minor K. Kellogg, the painter, who was a long time the  intimate friend and travelling companion of Layard in Asia Minor.  Introducing the letters in which the antiquary disclosed the successful  result of his investigations, Mr. Kellogg says:         \"I can scarcely call to mind a person so admirably qualified in       all respects for prosecuting such laborious researches. He is       young, of a hardy and enduring constitution, is acquainted with       the Oriental languages, and speaks the Persian and Turkish       fluently. He is enthusiastic and indefatigable in every thing       he undertakes, and plentifully endowed with courage, prudence,       and good-nature.\"    This was more than two years before Layard himself, in his \"Nineveh and  its Remains,\" exhibited those triumphs of his intelligence and devotion  which have secured for him a place among the most famous travellers and  antiquaries in the world.    We take the occasion of copying the above portrait from the last number  of _Bentley's Miscellany_ to present, from various authentic sources, a  brief sketch of Dr. Layard's history. He is descended from the noble  French Protestant family of Raymond de Layarde, who accompanied the  Prince of Orange into England. He was born at Paris, during a temporary  visit of his parents to that metropolis, on the 5th of March, 1817. His  father, who was the son of the Rev. Dr. Henry Peter John Layard, Dean of  Bristol, filled a high civil office in Ceylon, between the years 1820  and 1830, and took great interest in the circulation of the Scriptures  among heathen nations. He was a man of considerable classical learning,  and of refined tastes. During the youth of his son, he lived at  Florence, where our young antiquary had free access to the stores of the  Pitti Palace, and of the Tribune. He thus became familiar from his  infancy with the language of Tuscany, and formed his taste for the fine  arts and literature upon the models of painting and sculpture amid which  he lived, and in the rich libraries which he frequented. In this manner  he added a thorough knowledge of modern languages to a competent  acquaintance with those of Greece and Rome. Here, also, he acquired,  almost involuntarily, a power over his pencil, which, long dormant, was  called forth by the sight of slabs with the noblest sculptures and the  finest inscriptions, crumbling into dust. No draughtsman had been  provided for his assistance, and had he not instantly determined to  arrest by the quickness of his eye, and the skill thus acquired,  improved subsequently by Mr. Kellogg's companionship, those fleeting  forms which were about to disappear for ever, many of the finest remains  of ancient art would have been irrecoverably lost.    On his return from Italy to England, he was urged to choose the  profession of the law; but his thirst for knowledge, his love of  adventure, and his foreign tastes and habits, led him, after a brief  apprenticeship, to travel. He left England, with no very definite  object, in the summer of 1839, and, accompanied by a friend, visited  Russia and other northern countries, and afterward, living some time in  Germany and the states on the Danube, made himself master of the German  language, and of several of the dialects of Transylvania. From Dalmatia  he passed into Montenegro, where he remained a considerable time,  assisting an able and active young chief in ameliorating the condition  of his semi-barbarous subjects. Travelling through Albania and Romelia,  where he met with numerous adventures, he arrived at Constantinople,  about the end of 1839. Here he made arrangements for visiting Asia  Minor, and other countries in the East, where he spent some years,  adopting the costume and leading the life of an Arab of the Desert, and  acquiring a thorough knowledge of the manners and languages of Turkey  and Arabia. In 1840 or 1841, he transmitted to the Royal Geographical  Society, an Itinerary from Constantinople to Aleppo, which does not seem  to have been published; but in the eleventh volume of the Journal of  that Society, we have an account of the tour which he performed with Mr.  Ainsworth, in April, 1840. He travelled in Persia in the same year, and  projected a journey for the purpose of examining Susa, and some other  places of interest in the Baktyari mountains, to which Major Rawlinson  had drawn the attention of the Geographical Society. With this view, he  left Ispahan in the middle of September, in company with Schiffeer Khan,  a Baktyari chief; and having crossed the highest part of the great chain  of Mungasht, he visited the ruins of Manjanik, which are of considerable  extent, and resemble those of the Susannian cities. He visited also the  ruins in the plain of Mel Amir, and copied some of their cuneiform  inscriptions. In crossing the hills to Susan, he was attacked by a tribe  of Dinarunis, and robbed of his watch, compass, &c.; but having  complained to the chief, and insisted on the return of every missing  article, he received back the whole of his property. It had been his  practice to traverse these mountains quite alone, and he was never  attacked or insulted, except on this occasion, when the country was in a  state of war. He found scarcely any remains at Susan to indicate the  site of a large city. In 1842 and 1843, he spent a considerable time in  the province of Khuistan, an elaborate description of which he  communicated through Lord Aberdeen to the Royal Geographical Society. It  was during these various journeys that he prepared himself for the great  task to which his best and ripest powers were to be devoted. In his  wanderings through Asia Minor and Syria he had scarcely left a spot  untrodden which tradition hallowed, or a ruin unexamined which was  consecrated by history. His companion shared his feelings and his zeal.  Unmindful of danger, they rode along with no other protection than their  arms. They tended their own horses, and, mixing with the people, they  acquired their manners and their language. He himself says: \"I had  traversed Asia Minor and Syria, visiting the ancient seats of  civilization, and the spots which religion had made holy. I now felt an  irresistible desire to penetrate to the regions beyond the Euphrates, to  which history and tradition point as the birthplace of the Wisdom of the  West.\"    With these feelings, he looked to the banks of the Tigris, and longed to  dispel the mysterious darkness which hung over Assyria and Babylonia.  He, accordingly, made preliminary visits to Mosul, inspected the ruins  of Nimroud and Kuyunjik, and, fortunately, obtained an interview with  Sir Stratford Canning at Constantinople, then on his way to England.  This distinguished man, who was formerly minister to the United States,  and is remembered with well-deserved gratitude by nearly every recent  traveller in the East, immediately discovered and appreciated the  character and talents of Mr. Layard. His knowledge of the East, and of  its manners and languages, recommended him in a peculiar manner to the  notice of the ambassador, who persuaded him to remain, and employed him  on many important public services. Sir Stratford Canning himself took a  deep interest in the researches which had been made by the French, and  he promptly aided his young countryman in carrying out the designs of  which we now have the histories in his books. In the summer of 1845 Mr.  Layard, Count Perpontier of the Prussian Embassy, and Mr. Kellogg,  quitted Constantinople together, and visited Brusa (where Layard was  some time dangerously ill from a _coup de soleil_), Mount Olympus, the  country of the Ourouks or Wandering Tartars, the valley of the  Rhyndacus, the Plain of Toushanloo, Kiutayah, the ruins of Azani, &c.  Shortly after he proceeded to Nimroud, and in December, 1847, he  returned to England with the fruits of his labors. He wrote to Mr.  Kellogg, who was now in New-York, under date of        \"CHELTENHAM, Jan. 16, 1848.         \"MY DEAR KELLOGG:--I was quite delighted to see your       handwriting again, when a few days ago I received your letter       of the 15th November, with the diploma of the New-York       Ethnological Society. I reached home on Christmas day, after       having been detained three months at Constantinople. As you may       well conceive, since my return I have not had a moment to       myself--for what with domestic rejoicings and general honors, I       have been in one continual movement and excitement. I was       gratified to find that the results of my labors had created       much more interest in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24912"],[0,"Finger plays for nursery and kindergarten (#1)"],[1,"by Linda Cantoni.

ROESKE      _Illustrations By_ L.J. BRIDGMAN      [D. Lothrop Company  Boston  1893]      [Illustration: \"WHAT THE CHILD IMITATES, HE BEGINS TO  UNDERSTAND.\"--_Froebel._]          PREFACE.      \"What the child imitates,\" says Froebel, \"he begins to understand. Let  him represent the flying of birds and he enters partially into the  life of birds. Let him imitate the rapid motion of fishes in the water  and his sympathy with fishes is quickened. Let him reproduce the  activities of farmer, miller and baker, and his eyes open to the  meaning of their work. In one word let him reflect in his play the  varied aspects of life and his thought will begin to grapple with  their significance.\"    In all times and among all nations, finger-plays have been a delight  of childhood. Countless babies have laughed and crowed over  \"Pat-a-cake\" and other performances of the soft little hands; while  children of whatever age never fail to find amusement in playing         \"Here is the church,         And here's the steeple,       Open the doors,         And here are the people!\"    and others as well known.    Yet it is not solely upon the pleasure derived from them, that  finger-plays depend for their _raison d'etre_. By their judicious and  early use, the development of strength and flexibility in the tiny lax  fingers may be assisted, and dormant thought may receive its first  awakening call through the motions which interpret as well as  illustrate the phase of life or activity presented by the words.    The eighteen finger-plays contained in this book have already, through  publication in BABYLAND, been introduced to their especial public, and  have been much used in homes, though perhaps more in kindergartens. It  will readily be seen that while some of the plays are for the babies  in the nursery, others are more suitable for older children.    A baby-friend, ten months old, plays \"All for Baby\" throughout,  pounding and clapping gleefully with all his might--while children  seven or eight years of age play and sing \"The Caterpillar,\" \"How the  Corn Grew\" and others with very evident enjoyment.    With a little study of the charming and expressive pictures with which  the artist, Mr. L.J. Bridgman, has so sympathetically illustrated the  rhymes, mothers and kindergartners have easily understood what motions  were intended. To elucidate still farther, however, the playing of  \"The Merry Little Men\" may be thus described:    During the singing of the first verse, the children look about in  every direction for the \"little men,\" but keep the hands hidden. At  the beginning of the second verse, raise both hands to full view with  fingers outspread and quiet. At the words, \"The first to come,\" etc.,  let the thumbs be shown alone, then the others as named in turn, till  all are again outspread as at the beginning of the second verse. In  the last verse the arms are moved from side to side, hands being  raised and fingers fluttering nimbly all the time. When displaying the  \"busy little men,\" raise the hands as high as possible.    The music, composed by Miss Cornelia C. Roeske, will be found  melodious and attractive and especially suited to the voices and  abilities of the very young children for whom it is chiefly intended.    The harmonic arrangement is also purposely simple in consideration of  the many mothers and kindergartners who cannot devote time to  preparatory practice.
