BUNGAY, SUFFOLK          PREFACE      The entire world of Islam is to-day in profound ferment. From Morocco to  China and from Turkestan to the Congo, the 250,000,000 followers of the  Prophet Mohammed are stirring to new ideas, new impulses, new  aspirations. A gigantic transformation is taking place whose results  must affect all mankind.    This transformation was greatly stimulated by the late war. But it began  long before. More than a hundred years ago the seeds were sown, and ever  since then it has been evolving; at first slowly and obscurely; later  more rapidly and perceptibly; until to-day, under the stimulus of  Armageddon, it has burst into sudden and startling bloom.    The story of that strange and dramatic evolution I have endeavoured to  tell in the following pages. Considering in turn its various  aspects--religious, cultural, political, economic, social--I have tried  to portray their genesis and development, to analyse their character,  and to appraise their potency. While making due allowance for local  differentiations, the intimate correlation and underlying unity of the  various movements have ever been kept in view.    Although the book deals primarily with the Moslem world, it necessarily  includes the non-Moslem Hindu elements of India. The field covered is  thus virtually the entire Near and Middle East. The Far East has not  been directly considered, but parallel developments there have been  noted and should always be kept in mind.

INTRODUCTION    THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE OLD ISLAMIC WORLD      The rise of Islam is perhaps the most amazing event in human history.  Springing from a land and a people alike previously negligible, Islam  spread within a century over half the earth, shattering great empires,  overthrowing long-established religions, remoulding the souls of races,  and building up a whole new world--the world of Islam.    The closer we examine this development the more extraordinary does it  appear. The other great religions won their way slowly, by painful  struggle, and finally triumphed with the aid of powerful monarchs  converted to the new faith. Christianity had its Constantine, Buddhism  its Asoka, and Zoroastrianism its Cyrus, each lending to his chosen cult  the mighty force of secular authority. Not so Islam. Arising in a desert  land sparsely inhabited by a nomad race previously undistinguished in  human annals, Islam sallied forth on its great adventure with the  slenderest human backing and against the heaviest material odds. Yet  Islam triumphed with seemingly miraculous ease, and a couple of  generations saw the Fiery Crescent borne victorious from the Pyrenees  to the Himalayas and from the deserts of Central Asia to the deserts of  Central Africa.    This amazing success was due to a number of contributing factors, chief  among them being the character of the Arab race, the nature of  Mohammed's teaching, and the general state of the contemporary Eastern  world. Undistinguished though the Arabs had hitherto been, they were a  people of remarkable potentialities, which were at that moment patently  seeking self-realization. For several generations before Mohammed,  Arabia had been astir with exuberant vitality. The Arabs had outgrown  their ancestral paganism and were instinctively yearning for better  things. Athwart this seething ferment of mind and spirit Islam rang like  a trumpet-call. Mohammed, an Arab of the Arabs, was the very incarnation  of the soul of his race. Preaching a simple, austere monotheism, free  from priestcraft or elaborate doctrinal trappings, he tapped the  well-springs of religious zeal always present in the Semitic heart.  Forgetting the chronic rivalries and blood-feuds which had consumed  their energies in internecine strife, and welded into a glowing unity by  the fire of their new-found faith, the Arabs poured forth from their  deserts to conquer the earth for Allah, the One True God.    Thus Islam, like the resistless breath of the sirocco, the desert wind,  swept out of Arabia and encountered--a spiritual vacuum. Those  neighbouring Byzantine and Persian Empires, so imposing to the casual  eye, were mere dried husks, devoid of real vitality. Their religions  were a mockery and a sham. Persia's ancestral cult of Zoroaster had  degenerated into \"Magism\"--a pompous priestcraft, tyrannical and  persecuting, hated and secretly despised. As for Eastern Christianity,  bedizened with the gewgaws of paganism and bedevilled by the maddening  theological speculations of the decadent Greek mind, it had become a  repellent caricature of the teachings of Christ. Both Magism and  Byzantine Christendom were riven by great heresies which engendered  savage persecutions and furious hates. Furthermore, both the Byzantine  and Persian Empires were harsh despotisms which crushed their subjects  to the dust and killed out all love of country or loyalty to the state.  Lastly, the two empires had just fought a terrible war from which they  had emerged mutually bled white and utterly exhausted.    Such was the world compelled to face the lava-flood of Islam. The result  was inevitable. Once the disciplined strength of the East Roman legions  and the Persian cuirassiers had broken before the fiery onslaught of the  fanatic sons of the desert, it was all over. There was no patriotic  resistance. The down-trodden populations passively accepted new masters,  while the numerous heretics actually welcomed the overthrow of  persecuting co-religionists whom they hated far worse than their alien  conquerors. In a short time most of the subject peoples accepted the new  faith, so refreshingly simple compared with their own degenerate cults.  The Arabs, in their turn, knew how to consolidate their rule. They were  no bloodthirsty savages, bent solely on loot and destruction. On the  contrary, they were an innately gifted race, eager to learn and  appreciative of the cultural gifts which older civilizations had to  bestow. Intermarrying freely and professing a common belief, conquerors  and conquered rapidly fused, and from this fusion arose a new  civilization--the Saracenic civilization, in which the ancient cultures  of Greece, Rome, and Persia were revitalized by Arab vigour and  synthesized by the Arab genius and the Islamic spirit. For the first  three centuries of its existence (circ. A.D. 650-1000) the realm of  Islam was the most civilized and progressive portion of the world.  Studded with splendid cities, gracious mosques, and quiet universities  where the wisdom of the ancient world was preserved and appreciated, the  Moslem East offered a striking contrast to the Christian West, then sunk  in the night of the Dark Ages.    However, by the tenth century the Saracenic civilization began to  display unmistakable symptoms of decline. This decline was at first  gradual. Down to the terrible disasters of the thirteenth century it  still displayed vigour and remained ahead of the Christian West. Still,  by the year A.D. 1000 its golden age was over. For this there were  several reasons. In the first place, that inveterate spirit of faction  which has always been the bane of the Arab race soon reappeared once  more. Rival clans strove for the headship of Islam, and their quarrels  degenerated into bloody civil wars. In this fratricidal strife the  fervour of the first days cooled, and saintly men like Abu Bekr and  Omar, Islam's first standard-bearers, gave place to worldly minded  leaders who regarded their position of \"Khalifa\"[1] as a means to  despotic power and self-glorification. The seat of government was moved  to Damascus in Syria, and afterward to Bagdad in Mesopotamia. The reason  for this was obvious. In Mecca despotism was impossible. The fierce,  free-born Arabs of the desert would tolerate no master, and their innate  democracy had been sanctioned by the Prophet, who had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24108"],[0,"Fables in Rhyme for Little Folks (#1)"],[1,"IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,    Adapted from the French of La Fontaine.    Written by,  W. T. Larned    Illustrated by,  John Rae.    E-Book Created by Tyler Anderson,  as a birthday present to little  Johnny James Webb, on his first Birthday.  I've arranged the images so they fit the story.    To All Little Americans  With The Hope That  They May Become Better Acquainted  With  Our Friends, The French.        A Preface For Parents    La Fontaine composed the most entertaining Fables ever  written in any language, and made them a model of literary  perfection; yet our translators and compilers have somehow  neglected him. His Fables are lyric poetry of a high order,  and this alone has doubtless been a barrier to a better  acquaintance with his work when transferred to our own  tongue. Done into prose, the Fables are no longer  La Fontaine, but take their place with the many  respectable, dull translations which English readers try to  admire because they are classics--though the soul that  made them such has been separated from the dead body.    It has seemed to me that while the full enjoyment of  La Fontaine must always be reserved for those who can  read him in French, it might be possible at least to convey  something of his originality and blithe spirit through the  medium of light verse. In making the attempt I am fully  aware of my temerity, and the criticism it will invite. To  excuse the one and to meet the other I have taken refuge  in the term \"adaptation\"--even though the word applies  only in part to my paraphrases. Some of the Fables in  this book are translations in a true sense, and keep  closely to the text. From others I have erased such  political, mythological and literary allusions (in which  La Fontaine abounds) as are either obsolete or  unintelligible to a child.    But my chief literary sin--if sin it be--is twofold. In the first  place I have departed wholly from the metrical arrangements  of the originals--substituting therefore a variety of forms in  line and stanza that more accord with the modern and  American ear. In the second place I have had the  hardihood--as in \"The Lion and The Gnat\"--to modify the  elegance of the original with phrases more appropriate to  our contemporary beasts. Animal talk, I feel sure, has lost  something of its stateliness since the days when our  French author overheard it. The Owl is no less pedantic  perhaps, but the Lion certainly has declined in  majesty--along with our human kings.    For these offenses, La Fontaine--who forgave everyone--is  bound to forgive me. The most good-humored Frenchmen,  he could condone all faults but dullness. That offense  against French fundamental principles invariably put him  to sleep--whether the bore who button-holed him was a  savant of the Sorbonne or just an ordinary ass.    One thing more. This little collection from his 240 Fables is  meant, first of all, for children. In assembling it no Fable  was admitted that has not been approved by generations  of the young and old. No apologue addressed to the  mature intelligence alone, or framed to fit the society  of his day, is here included.    Many books which men have agreed to call classics are  seldom taken down from the shelves. It is otherwise with  La Fontaine. His Fables were eagerly read by the great  men and women of his time, and are still read and  enjoyed all the world over.    The causes of this lasting popularity are not obscure. From  the earliest period--whether in India, Greece, Arabia or  Rome--the Fable has pleased and instructed mankind. It  told important truths, easily perceived, in an entertaining  way; and often said more in a few words than could be  said through any other kind of writing. Now, no one person  is the author of the Fables we know so well. Aesop did not  write the Fables bearing his name. There is even reason to  believe that Aesop is himself a Fable. At any rate, the  things ascribed to him are the work of many hands, and  have undergone many changes. These old stories of  animals began to be written so long ago, and the history  of them is so vague and confusing, that only in recent  years have scholars at last been able to trace them, and  to fix their authorship.    The significant thing to keep in mind is that, for twentieth  century readers, the best Fables are not merely the best  ones ever written, but the best ones re-written. In other  words, the Fable was for centuries an old story in a rough  state, and the writers who have made it most interesting  are the writers who told it over again in a manner that  makes it Art. A Greek named Babrius, of whom almost  nothing is known, is remembered because he collected  and versified some of the so-called Fables of Aesop. A  Roman slave named Phaedrus also put these Fables  into Latin verse; and his work to-day is a text book in  our colleges.    Among modern writers, it was reserved for La Fontaine to  take these ancient themes and make them his own--just  as Moliere, \"taking his own wherever he found it,\" borrowed  freely from the classics for his greatest plays; just as  Shakespeare re-formed forgotten tales with the glow and  splendor of surpassing genius, so La Fontaine turned to  India, Greece, Italy, and furnishing the old Fables and  facetious tales, refreshed them with his originality. Some  of them were his own inventions, but for the most part  they were \"Aesop\" and Phaedrus, made over by poetic  art and vivified with a wit and humor characteristically  French.    But if La Fontaine's fame endures, it is not alone that he  was the greatest lyric poet of a great literary period.  Apart from the wit and fancy of his creations--apart from  the philosophy, wisdom, and knowledge of human nature  that so delighted Moliere, Boileau and Racine--his Fables  disclose the goodness and simplicity of one who lived  much with Nature, and cared nothing for the false  splendors of the court. Living most of his life in the  country, the woods, and streams and fields had been a  constant source of inspiration. He saw animals through  the eyes of a naturalist and poet; and when he came to  make them talk, the little fishes \"talked like little  fishes--not like whales\". With Shakespeare's banished  Frenchman in the Forest of Arden, he  Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,  Sermons in stones, and good in everything.    An anecdote often told of him aptly illustrates his habit  of mind. He was late in coming to a fashionable dinner,  and his excuse was this:  \"I hope you will pardon me,\" he said. \"I was detained at  the funeral of an ant, and I could not come until the  ceremony was over.\"    This was not a pleasantry, but the truth. He had been  watching an ant-hill, and was so absorbed in observing  a dead ant carried off by the living colonists for burial  that he had forgotten his engagement.    The first six volumes of the Fables--published in 1668,  when he was 47, and in Paris--were an immediate and  brilliant success, at a time when French genius was in  full flower. But the literary men of that golden age got  their pecuniary reward not from the public, but from  patrons. Later in life, when La Fontaine at last was  graciously recognized by the grand monarch, he  appeared before the royal presence to receive his due.  Even then, with his usual absentmindedness, he forgot  to bring the book he was to present, and left behind him  in the carriage the purse of gold the King bestowed  upon him.    However, the Fables brought him much in fame and  friendship. Everybody loved La Fontaine. Favorite of great  lords and ladies, the court of Louis XIV could not make  him otherwise than natural. Poor and improvident, poverty  had no pangs for him. No sorrow ever gave him a  sleepless hour. To the last he lived up to his  nickname--Bon-homme. And it is the gentle and good  man who is always looking out at us at us from the  fables he refashioned for all time.    William Trowbridge Larned.  New York, July 1918.        This book contains the following Fables  from the French of La Fontaine:    The Frog Who Wished To Be As Big As The Ox.  The Grasshopper And The Ant.  The Cat And The Fox.  The Hen With The Golden Eggs.  The Dog And His Image.  The Acorn And The Pumpkin.  The Raven And The Fox.  The City Mouse And The Country Mouse.  The Lion And The Gnat.  The Dove And The Ant.  The Fox And The Grapes.  The Ass In The Lion's Skin.  The Fox And The Stork.  The Monkey And The Cat.  The Hare And The Tortoise.  The Heron Who Was Hard To Please.  The Raven Who Would Rival The Eagle.  The Miller, His Son And The Ass.        The Frog Who Wished To Be As Big As The Ox.    There was a little Fog  Whose home was in a bog,  And he worried 'cause he wasn't big enough.  He sees an ox and cries:  \"That's just about my size,  If I stretch myself--Say Sister, see me puff!\"    So he blew, blew, blew,  Saying: \"Sister, will that do?\"  But she shook her head. And then he lost his wits.  For he stretched and puffed again  Till he cracked beneath the strain,  And burst, and flew about in little bits.        The Grasshopper And The Ant.    The Grasshopper, singing  All summer long,  Now found winter stinging,  And ceased in his song.  Not a morsel or crumb in his cupboard--  So he shivered, and ceased in his song.    Miss Ant was his neighbor;  To her he went:  \"O, you're rich from labor,  And I've not a cent.  Lend me food, and I vow I'll return it,  Though at present I have not a cent.\"    The Ant's not a lender,  I must confess.  Her heart's far from tender  To one in distress.  So she said: \"Pray, how passed you the summer,  That in winter you come to distress?\"    \"I sang through the summer,\"  Grasshopper said.  \"But now I am glummer  Because I've no bread.\"  \"So you sang!\" sneered the Ant. \"That relieves me.  Now it's winter--go dance for your bread!\"        The Cat And The Fox.    The Cat and the Fox once took a walk together,  Sharpening their wits with talk about the weather  "]]]
