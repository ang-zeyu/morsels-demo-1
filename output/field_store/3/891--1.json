VOL. I.      JANUARY, 1880.      NO. 1.          THE CONFLICT.      The pyramids, temples and palaces of Thebes are monuments of the ancient  intellects of our race. Great thinkers only were capable of giving to  the world the Vedas, the Apollo Belvidere and the Parthenon. The arts  and astronomy of Egypt harmonize very poorly with the idea that modern  scientists have all the wisdom and intelligence known in the history of  the ages. Among the wonderful characters of olden times we find  Epictetus, Josephus, Strabo, Pliny, Seneca, Virgil, Aristotle, Plato,  Tacitus, Thucydides and Herodotus.    The \"Speculation of Evolution of Species\" was advocated among the Greeks  six hundred years before the birth of Christ. Two thousand and three  hundred years ago the entire system of German philosophy, along with  modern pantheism, was advocated by the Buddhists and Brahmins.    In many very important respects the ancients were in advance of us,  especially in the arts, and we can not boast of superiority in either  letters or philosophy. \"The gentlemen of modern materialistic schools do  not compare favorably with Plato and Cicero in the elevation and  reverence of their opinions.\" \"Science has certainly made some  advancement, but where is the warrant for the boasting\" of sciolists of  modern times?    Buddhists taught the most perfect outline of materialism in general.  \"They believed in a supreme force, but denied the existence of a Supreme  Being. They rejected inquiry into first causes as unscientific,\"  maintaining that facts alone were to be dealt with in all our  investigations.    The Brahmin contemplated the moment when his spirit would flow back into  the great \"Pantheistic Being.\"    Modern materialists say, \"We deal only with facts.\" \"We never  speculate.\" The Buddhists, and the unbelievers who figure so boastingly  upon the rostrum in modern times, speak alike. They say: \"As many facts  and second causes as you please, but ask no questions about first  causes; _that_ is unscientific.\" We should ask no questions (?) about  the invisible. They have been very true (?) to their own principles.    There is nothing speculative (?) in the hypothesis that General George  Washington was evolved from a crustacean. There never was a more absurd  and wild speculation. It is an old speculation. Anaximander, who lived  six centuries before Christ, advocated the assumption. His words are the  following: \"The sun's heat, acting on the original miry earth, produced  filmy bladders or bubbles, and these, becoming surrounded with a prickly  rind, at length burst open, and as from an egg, animals came forth. At  first they were ill-formed and imperfect, but subsequently they  elaborated and developed.\" This has the genuine ring of the language of  modern unbelievers.    Christianity, in its beginning, had to encounter this \"speculation\"  along with the current literature and philosophy of a civilization which  was semi-barbarous and centuries old, but it triumphed over all, and in  the third century it triumphed everywhere. Since that time one effort  has been made upon the part of paganism to regain her former strength in  the old world. Julian made that effort. He tried to revive and establish  the supremacy of pagan thought by the power of the state. Subsequent to  this it disappeared in the east, and has only plead for toleration in  the west. But the dark ages came on in all their hideousness, and  unbelief developed itself about the close of the fifteenth century, all  over Europe. Paganism, as the result, was fostered near the bosom of  the church. The fifth Lateran Council proclaimed anew the tenet of the  imperishability of the spirit of man. The Padua University adopted a  system of materialism taught in the works of Alexander, of Aphrodisias.  A form of pantheism known in the philosophy of Averroes soon became a  center of skepticism.    In the latter part of the seventeenth century modern unbelievers began  their assaults. Lord Herbert and Hobbs in England, Spinoza in Holland,  and Bayle in France.    In seventeen hundred and thirteen Anthony Collins published a discourse  for the encouragement of a \"clique\" called \"Free-thinkers.\" This  discourse was thoroughly answered by Bently. In seventeen hundred and  twenty-seven Woolston made an effort to rationalize the miracles out of  existence, interpreting them after the style of Mr. Strauss. Three years  later Tyndal got out his dialogue called \"Christianity as old as the  Creation.\" The world received in return for this \"Butler's Analogy of  Natural and Revealed Religion.\" In seventeen hundred and thirty-seven  Morgan's \"Moral Philosophy\" made its appearance, claiming the  sufficiency of the moral law without any other religion. Warburton's  \"Divine Legation of Moses\" was gotten up in reply to this philosophy.  Thomas Chubb wrote a discourse upon reason, and got out a few other  small tracts denying the utility of prayer, and calling in question the  truth of the Scriptures of both Testaments, in the line of Morgan's  philosophy. Bolingbroke, ignorant of the law, \"that the greatest good of  the greatest number is to be sought after,\" even at the expense of the  lives of a few wicked Canaanites, assailed the justice and the  benevolence of the Bible God after Col Ingersoll's style, and boldly  avowed that the miracles of the New Testament never transpired; said,  \"If they did occur they attested the Revelation.\" Voltaire lived between  1694 and 1788. He made himself busy in France, while Bolingbroke and  Tyndal and Woolston, and Hume and Morgan were at work in England. Then  Didoret, of France, made his appearance upon the stage as a bold  defender of Atheism. Next comes D'Holbach, the leading author of the  \"Systeme de la Nature,\" which came out in 1774. Its object was to strike  down the idea of a God, of an intelligence separate from matter, of  free-will, and of immortality. Didoret and others are accused of  assisting in getting this book before the world. Rousseau lived in those  times, and assailed Christianity after the manner of Hume. To all these  enemies of Christianity we must add Condillac, who originated the  materialistic philosophy of France.    Gibbon and Paine came into notice after Bolingbroke, and the terrible  strife continued. Christianity was pronounced dead, and a prostitute was  chosen to impersonate the \"Goddess of Reason\" in the national  convention. God being dethroned in France, we should naturally look  there for the \"absolute liberty\" which unbelievers talk so much about.  But how was it? Were the people without a religious nature? Could they  think more freely? Were they in any sense better off? No, they \"followed  the prostitute into the church of 'Notre Dame' in a grand procession and  seated her upon the high altar, where she was worshiped by the  audience.\" This was the result of the labors of all the authors to which  I have called your attention. It was a wonderful gain? In all the public  cemeteries this inscription was read: \"Death is an eternal sleep.\"  Cabanis, Destutt de Tracy and Volney close up the seventeenth century,  but just about this time the \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" a work which is  the bed-rock of modern metaphysics, makes its appearance. According to  its teachings there are no realities in the world.    The struggle is passed in England. In France all are dull, drowsy. In  Germany all are hungry for the food that satisfies unbelievers. The  \"Critique of Pure Reason\" was followed by the labors of Fitche. He was  succeeded by Schelling, and he by Hegel. All forms of torture must be  added to this account of the conflict if we would get a glimpse of the  strength of the Christian religion and of the religious element in man's  nature, from the amount of resistance which they have defied. Eusebius  says, \"The swords became dull and shattered\" under Diocletian. \"The  executioners became weary and had to relieve each other.\" This would not  look as though Christianity would take the throne in four score years,  but it did in spite of all those cruel murders. Through Constantine it  became the state religion of the Roman Empire. Paganism crumbled down  and Christianity triumphed over all the opposition of the old world. The  books of the Old and New Testaments have all been thoroughly tested,  over and over in the fiery furnace of criticism, but Christianity still  lives to bless the hearts of widows and orphans; to bless the  disappointed and disconsolate. To-day there are more Christians in the  world than ever before.    What has unbelief to give to the people of our age more than it offered  centuries ago? Nothing! Nothing!! Nothing!!!    \"There is nothing new under the sun.\"          THE BIBLE--THE BACKGROUND AND THE PICTURE.      This book is admired and respected above all others for its antiquity,  its usefulness, its conflicts, and character. It has been expressly  denominated \"The book of books.\" Its professions are such that no  reasonable man can consistently lay it aside without giving it a careful  examination. The nature of every question determines its claims upon our  intelligence. If it professes to involve only a small interest its  claims are not so pressing.    The questions of the Bible hold in their principles the present and  eternal interests of our humanity, and therefore challenge the attention  of the world. Thousands of the wisest and best men of the ages have been  intensely interested in its contents. Its great "]]]
