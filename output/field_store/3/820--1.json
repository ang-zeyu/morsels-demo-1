I dedicate this little volume of ephemeral essays to you in recognition  of your worth as a man and a scientist, and as a token of warm  friendship.      Yours sincerely,      A. S. PACKARD, JR.          PREFACE.      This little volume mainly consists of a reprint of a series of essays  which appeared in the \"American Naturalist\" (Vols. i-v, 1867-71). It is  hoped that their perusal may lead to a better acquaintance with the  habits and forms of our more common insects. The introduction was  written expressly for this book, as well as Chapter XIII, \"Hints on the  Ancestry of Insects.\" The scientific reader may be drawn with greater  interest to this chapter than to any other portion of the book. In this  discussion of a perhaps abstruse and difficult theme, his indulgence is  sought for whatever imperfections or deficiencies may appear. Our  systems of classification may at least be tested by the application of  the theory of evolution. The natural system, if we mistake not, is the  genealogy of organized forms; when we can trace the latter, we establish  the former. Considering how much naturalists differ in their views as to  what is a natural classification, it is not strange that a genealogy of  animals or plants seems absurd to many. To another generation of  naturalists it must, perhaps, be left to decide whether to attempt the  one is more unphilosophical than to attempt the other.    Most of the cuts have already appeared in the \"Guide to the Study of  Insects\" and the \"American Naturalist,\" where their original sources are  given, while a few have been kindly contributed by Prof. A. E. Verrill,  the Boston Society of Natural History, and Prof. C. V. Riley, and three  are original.    SALEM, June, 1873.          OUR COMMON INSECTS.    INTRODUCTORY.      _What is an Insect?_ When we remember that the insects alone comprise  four-fifths of the animal kingdom, and that there are upwards of 200,000  living species, it would seem a hopeless task to define what an insect  is. But a common plan pervades the structure of them all. The bodies of  all insects consist of a succession of rings, or segments, more or less  hardened by the deposition of a chemical substance called chitine; these  rings are arranged in three groups: the head, the thorax, or middle  body, and the abdomen or hind body. In the six-footed insects, such as  the bee, moth, beetle or dragon fly, four of these rings unite early in  embryonic life to form the head; the thorax consists of three, as may be  readily seen on slight examination, and the abdomen is composed either  of ten or eleven rings. The body, then, seems divided or _insected_ into  three regions, whence the name _insect_.    The head is furnished with a pair of antennae, a pair of jaws  (mandibles), and two pairs of maxillae, the second and basal pair being  united at their base to form the so-called labium, or under lip. These  four pairs of appendages represent the four rings of the head, to which  they are appended in the order stated above.    A pair of legs is appended to each of the three rings of the thorax;  while the first and second rings each usually carry a pair of wings.    The abdomen contains the ovipositor; sometimes, as in the bees and  wasps, forming a sting. In the spiders (Fig. 1), however, there are no  antennae, and the second maxillae, or labium, is wanting. Moreover, there  are four pairs of legs. The centipedes (Fig. 2, a Myriopod) also differ  from the rest of the insects in having an indefinite number of abdominal  rings, each bearing a pair of legs.    [Illustration: 1. Spider (Tegenaria).]    On examining the arrangement of the parts within, we find the nervous  cord, consisting of two chains of swellings, or nerve-knots, resting  upon the floor or under side of the body; and the heart, or dorsal  vessel, situated just under the skin of the back; and in looking at  living caterpillars, such as the cut-worm, and many thin-skinned aquatic  larvae, we can see this long tubular heart pulsating about as often as  our own heart, and when the insect is held against its will, or is  agitated, the rapidity of the pulsations increases just as with us.    [Illustration: 2. Centipede.]    Insects do not breathe as in the higher animals by taking the air into  the mouth and filling the lungs, but there are a series of holes or  pores along the side of the body, as seen in the grub of the humble bee,  through which the air enters and is conveyed to every part of the body  by an immense number of air tubes. (Fig. 3, air tubes, or tracheae, in  the caudal appendage of the larva of a dragon fly). These air tubes are  everywhere bathed by the blood, by which the latter becomes oxygenated.    [Illustration: 3. Caudal appendage of larva of Agrion.]    Indeed the structure of an insect is entirely different from that of man  or the quadrupeds, or any other vertebrate animal, and what we call  head, thorax, abdomen, gills, stomach, skin, or lungs, or jaws, are  called so simply for convenience, and not that they are made in the same  way as those parts in the higher animals.    An insect differs from a horse, for example, as much as a modern  printing press differs from the press Franklin used. Both machines are  made of iron, steel, wood, etc., and both print; but the plan of their  structure differs throughout, and some parts are wanting in the simpler  press which are present and absolutely essential in the other. So with  the two sorts of animals; they are built up originally out of  protoplasm, or the original jelly-like germinal matter, which fills the  cells composing their tissues, and nearly the same chemical elements  occur in both, but the mode in which these are combined, the arrangement  of their products: the muscular, nervous and skin tissues, differ in the  two animals. The plan of structure, namely, the form and arrangement of  the body walls, the situation of the appendages to the body, and of the  anatomical systems within, i.e., the nervous, digestive, circulatory,  and respiratory systems, differ in their position in relation to the  walls of the body. Thus while the two sorts of animals reproduce their  kind, eat, drink and sleep, see, hear and smell, they perform these acts  by different kinds of organs, situated sometimes on the most opposite  parts of the body, so that there is no comparison save in the results  which they accomplish; they only agree in being animals, and in having a  common animal nature.    [Illustration: 4. Different forms of jaws.]    [Illustration: 5. Mouth parts of the Larva of a Beetle.]    [Illustration: 6. Maxilla of a Beetle.]    _How Insects Eat._ The jaws of insects (Fig. 4) are horny processes  situated on each side of the mouth. They are variously toothed, so as to  tear the food, and move horizontally instead of up and down as in the  horse. The act of taking the food, especially if the insect be  carnivorous in its habits, is quite complex, as not only the true jaws,  but the accessory jaws (maxillae, Fig. 5, _a_, upper, b, under side of  the head of a young beetle; _at_, antennae, _md_, mandible, _mx_,  maxillae, _mx_[1], labium) and the feelers (palpi) attached to the  maxillae, and the under lip (labium) are of great service in enabling the  insect to detect its food both by the senses of touch and smell. The  maxillae are in the fully grown beetle (Fig. 6) divided into three lobes,  the outermost forming the palpus, and the two others forming sharp  teeth, often provided with hairs and minute brushes for cleansing the  adjoining parts; these strong curved teeth are used in seizing the food  and placing it between the grinders, where it is crushed, prepared for  digestion and swallowed. Fig. 7 represents the mouth parts of the humble  bee. (_b_, upper lip; _d_, mandible; _e_, maxilla; _f_, maxillary  palpus; _g_, tongue; _ih_, labium and tabial palpi; _k_, eye.)    [Illustration: 7. Mouth parts of a Humble Bee.]    The alimentary canal passes through the middle of the body, the stomach  forming usually a simple enlargement. Just before the stomach in certain  insects, as the grasshopper, is a gizzard armed with rows of powerful  horny teeth for finely crushing grass.    Insects eat almost incredible quantities of food when young and growing  rapidly. Mr. Trouvelot tells us in the \"American Naturalist\" that the  food taken by a single American Silk-worm in fifty-six days is equal to  eighty-six thousand times its primitive weight! On the other hand, after  the insect has finished its transformations, it either takes no food at  all, as in the May fly, or merely sips the honey of flowers, as in the  butterfly, while the June beetle and many others like it eat the leaves  of trees, and the tiger and ground beetles feed voraciously on other  insects.    _How Insects Walk._ In man and his allies, the vertebrates, the process  of walking is a most difficult and apparently dangerous feat.

Burgess        TO THE CAUSE OF WILD LIFE IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY THE MAMMALS MANY OF WHICH ARE  SERIOUSLY THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION, THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED.        PREFACE    The cordial reception given the Burgess Bird Book for Children,  together with numerous letters to the author asking for information  on the habits and characteristics of many of the mammals of  America, led to the preparation of this volume. It is offered  merely as an introduction to the four-footed friends, little and  big, which form so important a part of the wild life of the United  States and Canada.    There has been no attempt to describe or classify sub-species.  That is for the scientist and student with specific interests.  The purpose of this book is to acquaint the reader with the  larger groups--orders, families, and divisions of the latter,  so that typical representatives may be recognized and their  habits understood.    Instead of the word mammal, the word animal has been used  throughout as having a better defined meaning to the average  child.  A conscientious effort to avoid technical terms and  descriptions has been made that there may be nothing to confuse  the young mind. Clarity and simplicity have been the objects  kept constantly in view.    At the same time the utmost care to be accurate in the smallest  details has been exercised. To this end the works of leading  authorities on American mammals have been carefully consulted  and compared. No statements which are not confirmed by two or  more naturalists of recognized standing have been made.    In this research work the writings of Audubon and Bachman, Dr. E.W.  Neson, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Dr. W.T. Hornaday, Ernest Thompson Seton  and others, together with the bulletins of the Biological Survey of  the Department of Agriculture at Washington, have been of the  greatest value. I herewith acknowledge my debt to these.    Whatever the text may lack in clearness of description will be  amply compensated for by the wonderful drawings in color and  black-an-white by Mr. Louis Agassiz Fuertes, the artist-naturalist,  whose hearty cooperation has been a source of great help to me.  These drawings were made especially for this book and add in no  small degree to such value as it may possess.    If the reading of these pages shall lead even a few to an active  interest in our wild animals, stimulating a desire to preserve  and protect a priceless heritage from the past which a heedless  present threatens through wanton and reckless waste to deny the  future, the labor will have been well worth while.    Only through intimate acquaintance may understanding of the animals  in their relations to each other and to man be attained.  To serve  as a medium for this purpose this book has been written.  As such  I offer it to the children of America, conscious of its  shortcomings yet hopeful that it will prove of some value in  acquainting them with their friends and mine--the animals of field  and wood, of mountain and desert, in the truest sense the first  citizens of America.

It was quite true  that if he had been one jump farther from that hole, Reddy Fox  would have caught him.  As it was, the hairs on Peter's funny  white tail actually had tickled Reddy's back as Peter plunged  frantically through the root-bound entrance to that hole.  It  had been the narrowest escape Peter had had for a long, long time.  You see, Reddy Fox had surprised Peter nibbling sweet clover on the  bank of the Smiling Pond, and it had been a lucky thing for Peter  that that hole, dug long ago by Johnny Chuck's grandfather, had  been right where it was.  Also, it was a lucky thing that old  Mr. Chuck had been wise enough to make the entrance between  the  roots of that tree in such a way that it could not be  dug any larger.    Reddy Fox was too shrewd to waste any time trying to dig it larger.  He knew there wasn't room enough for him to get between those roots.  So, after trying to make Peter as uncomfortable as possible by  telling him what he, Reddy, would do to him when he did catch him,  Reddy trotted off across the Green Meadows.  Peter remained where  he was for a long time. When he was quite sure that it was safe to  do so, he crept out and hurried, lipperty-lipperty-lip, up to the  Old Orchard.  He felt that that would be the safest place for him,  because there were ever so many hiding places in the old stone wall  along the edge of it.    When Peter reached the Old Orchard, who should he see but Jenny  Wren."]]]
