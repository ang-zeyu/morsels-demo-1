[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2412"],[0,"The Categories (#1)"],[1,"Categories      By    Aristotle      Translated by E. M. Edghill        Section 1    Part 1    Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a  common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for  each. Thus, a real man and a figure in a picture can both lay claim to  the name 'animal'; yet these are equivocally so named, for, though they  have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs  for each. For should any one define in what sense each is an animal,  his definition in the one case will be appropriate to that case only.    On the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally' which have  both the name and the definition answering to the name in common. A man  and an ox are both 'animal', and these are univocally so named,  inasmuch as not only the name, but also the definition, is the same in  both cases: for if a man should state in what sense each is an animal,  the statement in the one case would be identical with that in the other.    Things are said to be named 'derivatively', which derive their name  from some other name, but differ from it in termination. Thus the  grammarian derives his name from the word 'grammar', and the courageous  man from the word 'courage'.        Part 2    Forms of speech are either simple or composite. Examples of the latter  are such expressions as 'the man runs', 'the man wins'; of the former  'man', 'ox', 'runs', 'wins'.    Of things themselves some are predicable of a subject, and are never  present in a subject. Thus 'man' is predicable of the individual man,  and is never present in a subject.    By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are  present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the  said subject.    Some things, again, are present in a subject, but are never predicable  of a subject. For instance, a certain point of grammatical knowledge is  present in the mind, but is not predicable of any subject; or again, a  certain whiteness may be present in the body (for colour requires a  material basis), yet it is never predicable of anything.    Other things, again, are both predicable of a subject and present in a  subject. Thus while knowledge is present in the human mind, it is  predicable of grammar.    There is, lastly, a class of things which are neither present in a  subject nor predicable of a subject, such as the individual man or the  individual horse. But, to speak more generally, that which is  individual and has the character of a unit is never predicable of a  subject. Yet in some cases there is nothing to prevent such being  present in a subject. Thus a certain point of grammatical knowledge is  present in a subject.        Part 3    When one thing is predicated of another, all that which is predicable  of the predicate will be predicable also of the subject. Thus, 'man' is  predicated of the individual man; but 'animal' is predicated of 'man';  it will, therefore, be predicable of the individual man also: for the  individual man is both 'man' and 'animal'.    If genera are different and co-ordinate, their differentiae are  themselves different in kind. Take as an instance the genus 'animal'  and the genus 'knowledge'. 'With feet', 'two-footed', 'winged',  'aquatic', are differentiae of 'animal'; the species of knowledge are  not distinguished by the same differentiae. One species of knowledge  does not differ from another in being 'two-footed'.    But where one genus is subordinate to another, there is nothing to  prevent their having the same differentiae: for the greater class is  predicated of the lesser, so that all the differentiae of the predicate  will be differentiae also of the subject.        Part 4    Expressions which are in no way composite signify substance, quantity,  quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, or affection.  To sketch my meaning roughly, examples of substance are 'man' or 'the  horse', of quantity, such terms as 'two cubits long' or 'three cubits  long', of quality, such attributes as 'white', 'grammatical'. 'Double',  'half', 'greater', fall under the category of relation; 'in the  market place', 'in the Lyceum', under that of place; 'yesterday', 'last  year', under that of time. 'Lying', 'sitting', are terms indicating  position, 'shod', 'armed', state; 'to lance', 'to cauterize', action;  'to be lanced', 'to be cauterized', affection.    No one of these terms, in and by itself, involves an affirmation; it is  by the combination of such terms that positive or negative statements  arise. For every assertion must, as is admitted, be either true or  false, whereas expressions which are not in any way composite such as  'man', 'white', 'runs', 'wins', cannot be either true or false.        Part 5    Substance, in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the  word, is that which is neither predicable of a subject nor present in a  subject; for instance, the individual man or horse. But in a secondary  sense those things are called substances within which, as species, the  primary substances are included; also those which, as genera, include  the species. For instance, the individual man is included in the  species 'man', and the genus to which the species belongs is 'animal';  these, therefore--that is to say, the species 'man' and the genus  'animal,-are termed secondary substances.    It is plain from what has been said that both the name and the  definition of the predicate must be predicable of the subject. For  instance, 'man' is predicated of the individual man. Now in this case  the name of the species 'man' is applied to the individual, for we use  the term 'man' in describing the individual; and the definition of  'man' will also be predicated of the individual man, for the individual  man is both man and animal. Thus, both the name and the definition of  the species are predicable of the individual.    With regard, on the other hand, to those things which are present in a  subject, it is generally the case that neither their name nor their  definition is predicable of that in which they are present. Though,  however, the definition is never predicable, there is nothing in  certain cases to prevent the name being used. For instance, 'white'  being present in a body is predicated of that in which it is present,  for a body is called white: the definition, however, of the colour  'white' is never predicable of the body.    Everything except primary substances is either predicable of a primary  substance or present in a primary substance. This becomes evident by  reference to particular instances which occur. 'Animal' is predicated  of the species 'man', therefore of the individual man, for if there  were no individual man of whom it could be predicated, it could not be  predicated of the species 'man' at all. Again, colour is present in  body, therefore in individual bodies, for if there were no individual  body in which it was present, it could not be present in body at all.  Thus everything except primary substances is either predicated of  primary substances, or is present in them, and if these last did not  exist, it would be impossible for anything else to exist.    Of secondary substances, the species is more truly substance than the  genus, being more nearly related to primary substance. For if any one  should render an account of what a primary substance is, he would  render a more instructive account, and one more proper to the subject,  by stating the species than by stating the genus. Thus, he would give a  more instructive account of an individual man by stating that he was  man than by stating that he was animal, for the former description is  peculiar to the individual in a greater degree, while the latter is too  general. Again, the man who gives an account of the nature of an  individual tree will give a more instructive account by mentioning the  species 'tree' than by mentioning the genus 'plant'.    Moreover, primary substances are most properly called substances in  virtue of the fact that they are the entities which underlie everything  else, and that everything else is either predicated of them or present  in them. Now the same relation which subsists between primary substance  and everything else subsists also between the species and the genus:  for the species is to the genus as subject is to predicate, since the  genus is predicated of the species, whereas the species cannot be  predicated of the genus. Thus we have a second ground for asserting  that the species is more truly substance than the genus.    Of species themselves, except in the case of such as are genera, no one  is more truly substance than another. We should not give a more  appropriate account of the individual man by stating the species to  which he belonged, than we should of an individual horse by adopting  the same method of definition. In the same way, of primary substances,  no one is more truly substance than another; an individual man is not  more truly substance than an individual ox.    It is, then, with good reason that of all that remains, when we exclude  primary substances, we concede to species and genera alone the name  'secondary substance', for these alone of all the predicates convey a  knowledge of primary substance. For it is by stating the species or the  genus that we appropriately define any individual man; and we shall  make our definition more exact by stating the former than by stating  the latter. All other things that we state, such as that he is white,  that he runs, and so on, are irrelevant to the definition. Thus it is  just that these alone, apart from primary substances, should be called  substances.    Further, primary substances are most properly so called, because they  underlie and are the subjects of everything else. Now the same relation  that subsists between primary substance and everything else subsists  also between the species and the genus to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24125"],[0,"A Little Book for A Little Cook (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                                A little Book                              for A little Cook                                      COPYRIGHT 1905                               BY L.P.

This new reproduction has all of the recipes  from the original softcover edition, but is being reissued with  the modern reader in mind. The collector will note some small  departures from the original book, but the little cook will no  doubt find what is here to be fun to cook, delicious, and warmly  nostalgic.         For best results, we recommend the following recipe changes       when preparing these old-fashioned recipes. When using       Pillsbury BEST(R) Flour, there is no need to sift the flour.

LITTLE TALKS WITH LITTLE COOKS      The table around which the household gathers three times a day  furnishes the chief opportunity for showing the results of good  training, whether received in school or home. We show our  unselfishness in preferring one another, anticipating one  another's wants.    On the table is shown the result of the unselfish thought and  care of the chief home-maker. The labor connected with the  preparation of the meal is either a burden or a pleasure as one's  previous training has made possible.    We get the best training for active life, in other than household  work, early in life, at school and home. Why not learn to be good  home-makers while still young?    We like to do what we do well. If we learn early, we learn easily  and well--the work is a pleasure and success is assured.    Beginners should master the little recipes included in this book.  They require only a small amount of material, but enough for  success.          [Illustration]        This is the tale that was told to me      By a loaf of home-made bread, you see,        As it sat one night on the pantry shelf--        A loaf on each side of it--just like itself,      While grouped around stood the pies and cakes,      The good old kind like mother makes,        And one and all then and there confessed        That they owed their existence to Pillsbury's Best.          [Illustration]        I seem to trace through the distant haze      My byegone life in the good old days;        I see in my vision a field of wheat--        I knew I was there that the world might eat--      I drank of the showers and the morning dew;      In the noonday sun I throve and grew--        Grew on the verge of a sunny crest,        Just as fast as I could for Pillsbury's Best.
