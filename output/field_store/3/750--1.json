Nor can there be any doubt  that, when he started on board the _Beagle_, such opinions as he had  were on the side of immutability. When therefore did the current of his  thoughts begin to set in the direction of Evolution?         {1} See the extracts in _Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_, ii.       p. 5.    We have first to consider the factors that made for such a change. On  his departure in 1831, Henslow gave him vol. I. of Lyell's _Principles_,  then just published, with the warning that he was not to believe what he  read{2}. But believe he did, and it is certain (as Huxley has forcibly  pointed out{3}) that the doctrine of uniformitarianism when applied to  Biology leads of necessity to Evolution. If the extermination of a  species is no more catastrophic than the natural death of an individual,  why should the birth of a species be any more miraculous than the birth  of an individual? It is quite clear that this thought was vividly  present to Darwin when he was writing out his early thoughts in the 1837  Note Book{4}:--    \"Propagation explains why modern animals same type as extinct, which is  law almost proved. They die, without they change, like golden pippins;  it is a _generation of species_ like generation _of individuals_.\"    \"If _species_ generate other _species_ their race is not utterly cut  off.\"         {2} The second volume,--especially important in regard to       Evolution,--reached him in the autumn of 1832, as Prof. Judd has       pointed out in his most interesting paper in _Darwin and Modern       Science_. Cambridge, 1909.         {3} Obituary Notice of C. Darwin, _Proc. R. Soc._ vol. 44.       Reprinted in Huxley's _Collected Essays_. See also _Life and       Letters of C. Darwin_, ii. p. 179.         {4} See the extracts in the _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 5.    These quotations show that he was struggling to see in the origin of  species a process just as scientifically comprehensible as the birth of  individuals. They show, I think, that he recognised the two things not  merely as similar but as identical.    It is impossible to know how soon the ferment of uniformitarianism began  to work, but it is fair to suspect that in 1832 he had already begun to  see that mutability was the logical conclusion of Lyell's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#1)"],[1,"SWIFT AND HIS MOTOR-BOAT    Or    The Rivals of Lake Carlopa      By    VICTOR APPLETON          CONTENTS         I  A Motor-boat Auction      II  Some Lively Bidding     III  A Timely Warning      IV  Tom And Andy Clash       V  A Test Of Speed      VI  Towing Some Girls     VII  A Brush With Andy    VIII  Off On A Trip      IX  Mr. Swift Is Alarmed       X  A Cry For Help      XI  A Quick Run     XII  Suspicious Characters    XIII  Tom In Danger     XIV  The ARROW Disappears      XV  A Damaging Statement     XVI  Still On The Search    XVII  \"There She Is!\"   XVIII  The Pursuit     XIX  A Quiet Cruise      XX  News Of A Robbery     XXI  The Balloon On Fire    XXII  The Rescue   XXIII  Plans For An Airship    XXIV  The Mystery Solved     XXV  Winning A Race          CHAPTER I    A MOTOR-BOAT AUCTION      \"Where are you going, Tom?\" asked Mr. Barton Swift of his son as the  young man was slowly pushing his motor-cycle out of the yard toward the  country road.  \"You look as though you had some object in view.\"    \"So I have, dad.  I'm going over to Lanton.\"    \"To Lanton?  What for?\"    \"I want to have a look at that motor-boat.\"    \"Which boat is that, Tom? I don't recall your speaking about a boat  over at Lanton.  What do you want to look at it for?\"    \"It's the motor-boat those fellows had who tried to get away with your  turbine model invention, dad.  The one they used at the old General  Harkness mansion, in the woods near the lake, and the same boat that  fellow used when he got away from me the day I was chasing him here.\"    \"Oh, yes, I remember now.  But what is the boat doing over at Lanton?\"    \"That's where it belongs.  It's the property of Mr. Bently Hastings.  The thieves stole it from him, and when they ran away from the old  mansion, the time Mr. Damon and I raided the place, they left the boat  on the lake.  I turned it over to the county authorities, and they  found out it belonged to Mr. Hastings.  He has it back now, but I  understand it's somewhat damaged, and he wants to get rid of it.  He's  going to sell it at auction to-day, and I thought I'd go over and take  a look at it.  You see--\"    \"Yes, I see, Tom,\" exclaimed Mr. Swift with a laugh.  \"I see what  you're aiming at.  You want a motor-boat, and you're going all around  Robin Hood's barn to get at it.\"    \"No, dad, I only--\"    \"Oh, I know you, Tom, my lad!\" interrupted the inventor, shaking his  finger at his son, who seemed somewhat confused.  \"You have a nice  rowing skiff and a sailboat, yet you are hankering for a motor-boat.  Come now, own up.  Aren't you?\"    \"Well, dad, a motor-boat certainly would go fine on Lake Carlopa.  There's plenty of room to speed her, and I wonder there aren't more of  them.  I was going to see what Mr. Hastings' boat would sell for, but I  didn't exactly think of buying it' Still--\"    \"But you wouldn't buy a damaged boat, would you?\"    \"It isn't much damaged,\" and in his eagerness the young inventor (for  Tom Swift had taken out several patents) stood his motor-cycle up  against the fence and came closer to his father.  \"It's only slightly  damaged,\" he went on. \"I can easily fix it.  I looked it all over  before I gave it in charge of the authorities, and it's certainly a  fine boat. It's worth nine hundred dollars--or it was when it was new.\"    \"That's a good deal of money for a boat,\" and Mr. Swift looked serious,  for though he was well off, he was inclined to be conservative.    \"Oh, I shouldn't think of paying that much.  In fact, dad, I really had  no idea of bidding at the auction.  I only thought I'd go over and get  an idea of what the boat might sell for.  Perhaps some day--\"    Tom paused.  Since his father had begun to question him some new plans  had come into the lad's head.  He looked at his parent and saw a smile  beginning to work around the corners of Mr. Swift's lips.  There was  also a humorous look in the eyes of the older inventor.  He understood  boys fairly well, even if he only had one, and he knew Tom perfectly.    \"Would you really like to make a bid on that boat Tom?\" he asked.    \"Would I, dad? Well--\" The youth did not finish, but his father knew  what he meant.    \"I suppose a motor-boat would be a nice thing to have on Lake Carlopa,\"  went on Mr. Swift musingly.  \"You and I could take frequent trips in  it.  It isn't like a motor-cycle, only useful for one.  What do you  suppose the boat will go for, Tom?\"    \"I hardly know.  Not a high price, I believe, for motor-boats are so  new on our lake that few persons will take a chance on them.  But if  Mr. Hastings is getting another, he will not be so particular about  insisting on a high price for the old one.  Then, too, the fact that it  is damaged will help to keep the price down, though I know I can easily  put it in good shape.  I would like to make a bid, if you think it's  all right.\"    \"Well, I guess you may, Tom, if you really want it.  You have money of  your own and a motor-boat is not a bad investment.  What do you think  ought to be the limit?\"    \"Would you consider a hundred and fifty dollars too high?\"    Mr. Swift looked at Tom critically.  He was plainly going over several  matters in his mind, and not the least of them was the pluck his son  had shown in getting back some valuable papers and a model from a gang  of thieves.  The lad certainly was entitled to some reward, and to  allow him to get a boat might properly be part of it.    \"I think you could safely go as high as two hundred dollars, Tom,\" said  Mr. Swift at length.  \"That would be my limit on a damaged boat for it  might be better to pay a little more and get a new one.  However, use  your own judgment, but don't go over two hundred.  So the thieves who  made so much trouble for me stole that boat from Mr. Hastings, eh?\"    \"Yes, and they didn't take much care of it either.  They damaged the  engine, but the hull is in good shape.  I'm ever so glad you'll let me  bid on it.  I'll start right off.  The auction is at ten o'clock and I  haven't more than time to get there.\"    \"Now be careful how you bid.  Don't raise your own figures, as I've  sometimes seen women, and men too, do in their excitement.  Somebody  may go over your head; and if he does, let them.  If you get the boat  I'll be very glad on your account.  But don't bring any of Anson  Morse's gang back in it with you.  I've seen enough of them.\"    \"I'll not dad!\" cried Tom as he trundled his motor-cycle out of the  gate and into the country road that led to the village of Shopton,  where he lived, and to Lanton, where the auction was to be held.  The  young inventor had not gone far before he turned back, leaving his  machine standing on the side path.    \"What's the matter?\" asked his father, who had started toward one of  several machine shops on the premises--shops where Mr. Swift and his  son did inventive work.    \"Guess I'd better get a blank check and some money,\" replied Tom as he  entered the house.  \"I'll need to pay a deposit if I secure the boat.\"    \"That's so.  Well, good luck,\" and with his mind busy on a plan for a  new kind of storage battery, the inventor went on to his workroom.  Tom  got some cash and his checkbook from a small safe he owned and was soon  speeding over the road to Lanton, his motor-cycle making quite a cloud  of dust.  While he is thus hurrying along to the auction I will tell  you something about him.    Tom Swift, son of Barton Swift, lived with his father and a motherly  housekeeper, Mrs. Baggert, in a large house on the outskirts of the  town of Shopton, in New York State.  Mr. Swift had acquired  considerable wealth from his many inventions and patents, but he did  not give up working out his ideas simply because he had plenty of  money.  Tom followed in the footsteps of his parent and had already  taken out several patents.    Shortly before this story opens the youth had become possessed of a  motor-cycle in a peculiar fashion.  As told in the first volume of this  series, entitled \"Tom Swift and His Motor-cycle,\" Tom was riding to the  town of Mansburg on an errand for his father one day when he was nearly  run down by a motorcyclist.  A little later the same motorcyclist, who  was a Mr. Wakefield Damon, of Waterfield, collided with a tree near  Tom's home and was severely cut and bruised, the machine being broken.  Tom and his father cared for the injured rider, and Mr. Damon, who was  an eccentric individual, was so disheartened by his attempts to ride  the motor-cycle that he sold it to Tom for fifty dollars, though it had  cost much more.    About the same time that Tom bought the motor-cycle a firm of rascally  lawyers, Smeak & Katch by name, had, in conjunction with several men,  made an attempt to get control of an invention of a turbine motor  perfected by Mr. Swift.  The men, who were Ferguson Appleson, Anson  Morse, Wilson Featherton, alias Simpson, and Jake Burke, alias Happy  Harry, who sometimes disguised himself as a tramp, tried several times  to steal the model.    Their anxiety to get it was due to the fact that they had invested a  large sum in a turbine motor invented by another man, but their motor  would not work and they sought to steal Mr. Swift's.  Tom was sent to  Albany on his motor-cycle to deliver the model and some valuable papers  to Mr. Crawford, of the law firm of Reid & Crawford, of Washington,  attorneys for Mr. Swift.  Mr. Crawford had an errand in Albany and had  agreed to meet Tom there with the model.    But, on the way, Tom was attacked by the gang of unscrupulous men and  the model was stolen.  He was assaulted and carried far away in an  automobile.  In an attempt to capture the gang in a deserted mansion,  in the woods on the shore of Lake Carlopa, Tom was aided by Mr. Damon,  of whom he had purchased the motor-cycle.  The men escaped, however,  and nothing could be done to punish them.    Tom was thinking of the exciting scenes he had passed through about a  month previous as he"]]]
