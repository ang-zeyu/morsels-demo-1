KLEBER    PITTSBURGH    THE EQUAL FRANCHISE FEDERATION    OF WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA    MCMXV              COPYRIGHT, 1915, BY            THE EQUAL FRANCHISE FEDERATION            OF WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA              DEDICATED TO              _Mrs. Henry Villard_              AND              _Mrs. J. O. Miller_          _Introduction_      There are cook books and cook books, and their generation is not ended;  a generation that began in the Garden of Eden, presumably, for if Mother  Eve was not vastly different from her daughters she knew how to cook  some things better than her neighbors, and they wanted to know how she  made them and she wanted to tell them.    Indeed, it has been stated that the very first book printed, a small  affair, consisted mainly of recipes for \"messes\" of food, and for  remedies for diseases common in growing families.    Whether the very first book printed was a cook book or not, it is quite  true that among the very oldest books extant are those telling how to  prepare food, clothing and medicine. Some of these make mighty  interesting reading, particularly the portions relating to cures for all  sorts of ills, likewise of love when it seemed an ill, and of ill luck.    And who wouldn't cheerfully pay money, even in this enlightened day, for  a book containing recipes for just these same things? For in spite of  our higher civilization, broader education, and vastly extended  knowledge, we still believe in lucky days, lucky stones, and lucky  omens.    These formed no inconsiderable part of the old time cook book, and no  doubt would constitute a very attractive feature of a modern culinary  guide. However, hardly anyone would confess to having bought it on that  account.    In these later times professors of the culinary art tell us the cooking  has been reduced to a science, and that there is no more guess work  about it. They have given high sounding names to the food elements,  figured out perfectly balanced rations, and adjusted foods to all  conditions of health, or ill health. And yet the world is eating  practically the same old things, and in the same old way, the difference  being confined mainly to the sauces added to please the taste.    Now that women are coming into their own, and being sincerely interested  in the welfare of the race, it is entirely proper that they should  prescribe the food, balance the ration, and tell how it should be  prepared and served.    Seeing that a large majority of the sickness that plagues the land is  due to improper feeding, and can be prevented by teaching the simple  art of cooking, of serving and of eating, the wonder is that more  attention has not been given to instruction in the simpler phases of the  culinary art.    It is far from being certain that famous chefs have contributed greatly  to the health and long life of those able to pay the fine salaries they  demand. Nor are these sent to minister to the sick, nor to the working  people, nor to the poor. It would seem that even since before the time  of Lucullus their business has been mainly to invent and concoct dishes  that would appeal to perverted tastes and abnormal appetites.    The simple life promises most in this earthly stage of our existence,  for as we eat so we live, and as we live so we die, and after death the  judgment on our lives. Thus it is that our spiritual lives are more or  less directly influenced by our feeding habits.    Eating and drinking are so essential to our living and to our  usefulness, and so directly involved with our future state, that these  must be classed with our sacred duties. Hence the necessity for so  educating the children that they will know how to live, and how to  develop into hale, hearty and wholesome men and women, thus insuring the  best possible social and political conditions for the people of this  country.    \"The surest way into the affections of a man is through his stomach,  also to his pocket,\" is an ancient joke, and yet not all a joke, there  being several grains of truth in it, enough at least to warrant some  thoughtful attention.    Women being the homekeepers, and the natural guardians of the children,  it is important that they be made familiar with the culinary art so they  may be entirely competent to lead coming generations in the paths of  health and happiness.    So say the members of Equal Franchise Associations throughout the length  and breadth of our land, and beyond the border as far as true  civilization extends.    Hence this book which represents an honest effort to benefit the people,  old and young, native and foreign. It is not a speculative venture but a  dependable guide to a most desirable social, moral and physical state of  being.    Disguise it as we may the fact remains that the feeding of a people is  of first importance, seeing the feeding is the great essential to  success, either social or commercial. The farmer and stock raiser gives  special attention to feeding, usually more to the feeding of his animals  than of his children, or of himself. And yet he wonders why his domestic  affairs do not thrive and prosper as does his farming and stock  raising.    Physical trainers are most particular about what the members of their  classes eat and drink. One mess of strawberry short cake and cream will  unfit a boy for a field contest for a whole week, while a full meal of  dainties may completely upset a man or woman for a day or two.    The cook book of the past was filled mainly with recipes for dainties  rather than sane and wholesome dishes; the aim being to please the taste  for the moment rather than to feed the body and the brain.    Now that we are entering upon an age of sane living it is important that  the home makers should be impressed with the fact that good health  precedes all that is worth while in life, and that it starts in the  kitchen; that the dining room is a greater social factor than the  drawing room.    In the broader view of the social world that is dawning upon us the cook  book that tells us how to live right and well will largely supplant  Shakespeare, Browning, and the lurid literature of the day.                                               =ERASMUS WILSON=                                                      (The Quiet Observer)                The tocsin of the soul--the dinner bell.                                                 --Byron.      As it is a serious matter _what_ is put into the human stomach, I feel  it incumbent to say that my readers may safely eat everything set down  in this book.    Most recipes have been practically tested by me, and those of which I  have not eaten coming with such unquestionable authority, there need be  no hesitancy in serving them alike to best friend as well as worst  enemy--for I believe in the one case it will strengthen friendship, and  in the other case it will weaken enmity.    It being a human Cook Book there will likely be some errors, but as  correcting errors is the chief duty and occupation of Suffrage Women, I  shall accept gratefully whatever criticisms these good women may have to  offer.    I thank all for the courtesy shown me and hope our united efforts will  prove helpful to the Great Cause.    I ask pardon for any omission of contributors and their recipes.                                                        MRS. L. O. KLEBER.          List of Contributors        Mrs. John O.

And it is purely as a question of  anthropology (a department of biology to which, at various times, I have  given a good deal of attention) that I propose to treat of the evolution  of theology in the following pages.    With theology as a code of dogmas which are to be believed, or at any  rate repeated, under penalty of present or future punishment, or as a  storehouse of anaesthetics for those who find the pains of life too  hard to bear, I have nothing to do; and, so far as it may be possible,  I shall avoid the expression of any opinion as to the objective truth or  falsehood of the systems of theological speculation of which I may find  occasion to speak. From my present point of view, theology is regarded  as a natural product of the operations of the human mind, under the  conditions of its existence, just as any other branch of science, or  the arts of architecture, or music, or painting are such products. Like  them, theology has a history. Like them also, it is to be met with in  certain simple and rudimentary forms; and these can be connected by a  multitude of gradations, which exist or have existed, among people of  various ages and races, with the most highly developed theologies of  past and present times. It is not my object to interfere, even in the  slightest degree, with beliefs which anybody holds sacred; or to alter  the conviction of any one who is of opinion that, in dealing with  theology, we ought to be guided by considerations different from those  which would be thought appropriate if the problem lay in the province  of chemistry or of mineralogy. And if people of these ways of thinking  choose to read beyond the present paragraph, the responsibility for  meeting with anything they may dislike rests with them and not with me.    We are all likely to be more familiar with the theological history of  the Israelites than with that of any other nation. We may therefore  fitly make it the first object of our studies; and it will be convenient  to commence with that period which lies between the invasion of Canaan  and the early days of the monarchy, and answers to the eleventh and  twelfth centuries B.C. or thereabouts. The evidence on which any  conclusion as to the nature of Israelitic theology in those days must be  based is wholly contained in the Hebrew Scriptures--an agglomeration  of documents which certainly belong to very different ages, but of the  exact dates and authorship of any one of which (except perhaps a few  of the prophetical writings) there is no evidence, either internal or  external, so far as I can discover, of such a nature as to justify more  than a confession of ignorance, or, at most, an approximate conclusion.  In this venerable record of ancient life, miscalled a book, when it  is really a library comparable to a selection of works from English  literature between the times of Beda and those of Milton, we have the  stratified deposits (often confused and even with their natural order  inverted) left by the stream of the intellectual and moral life of  Israel during many centuries. And, embedded in these strata, there are  numerous remains of forms of thought which once lived, and which,  though often unfortunately mere fragments, are of priceless value to  the anthropologist. Our task is to rescue these from their relatively  unimportant surroundings, and by careful comparison with existing forms  of theology to make the dead world which they record live again. In  other words, our problem is palaeontological, and the method pursued  must be the same as that employed in dealing with other fossil remains.    Among the richest of the fossiliferous strata to which I have alluded  are the books of Judges and Samuel. [1] It has often been observed that  these writings stand out, in marked relief from those which precede and  follow them, in virtue of a certain archaic freshness and of a greater  freedom from traces of late interpolation and editorial trimming.  Jephthah, Gideon and Samson are men of old heroic stamp, who would  look as much in place in a Norse Saga as where they are; and if the  varnish-brush of later respectability has passed over these memoirs of  the mighty men of a wild age, here and there, it has not succeeded in  effacing, or even in seriously obscuring, the essential characteristics  of the theology traditionally ascribed to their epoch.    There is nothing that I have met with in the results of Biblical  criticism inconsistent with the conviction that these books give us a  fairly trustworthy account of Israelitic life and thought in the times  which they cover; and, as such, apart from the great literary merit of  many of their episodes, they possess the interest of being, perhaps, the  oldest genuine history, as apart from mere chronicles on the one hand  and mere legends on the other, at present accessible to us.    But it is often said with exultation by writers of one party, and often  admitted, more or less unwillingly, by their opponents, that these  books are untrustworthy, by reason of being full of obviously unhistoric  tales. And, as a notable example, the narrative of Saul's visit to the  so-called \"witch of Endor\" is often cited. As I have already intimated,  I have nothing to do with theological partisanship, either heterodox or  orthodox, nor, for my present purpose, does it matter very much whether  the story is historically true, or whether it merely shows what the  writer believed; but, looking at the matter solely from the point of  view of an anthropologist, I beg leave to express the opinion that  the account of Saul's necromantic expedition is quite consistent with  probability. That is to say, I see no reason whatever to doubt, firstly,  that Saul made such a visit; and, secondly, that he and all who were  present, including the wise woman of Endor herself, would have given,  with entire sincerity, very much the same account of the business as  that which we now read in the twenty-eighth chapter of the first book of  Samuel; and I am further of opinion that this story is one of the most  important of those fossils, to which I have referred, in the material  which it offers for the reconstruction of the theology of the time. Let  us therefore study it attentively--not merely as a narrative which, in  the dramatic force of its gruesome simplicity, is not surpassed, if it  is equalled, by the witch scenes in Macbeth--but as a piece of evidence  bearing on an important anthropological problem.    We are told (1 Sam. xxviii.) that Saul, encamped at Gilboa, became  alarmed by the strength of the Philistine army gathered at Shunem. He  therefore \"inquired of Jahveh,\" but \"Jahveh answered him not, neither  by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\" [2] Thus deserted by Jahveh,  Saul, in his extremity, bethought him of \"those that had familiar  spirits, and the wizards,\" whom he is said, at some previous time, to  have \"put out of the land\"; but who seem, nevertheless, to have been  very imperfectly banished, since Saul's servants, in answer to his  command to seek him a woman \"that hath a familiar spirit,\" reply without  a sign of hesitation or of fear, \"Behold, there is a woman that hath  a familiar spirit at Endor\"; just as, in some parts of England, a  countryman might tell any one who did not look like a magistrate or a  policeman, where a \"wise woman\" was to be met with. Saul goes to this  woman, who, after being assured of immunity, asks, \"Whom shall I bring  up to thee?\" whereupon Saul says, \"Bring me up Samuel.\" The woman  immediately sees an apparition. But to Saul nothing is visible, for he  asks, \"What seest thou?\" And the woman replies, \"I see Elohim coming up  out of the earth.\" Still the spectre remains invisible to Saul, for he  asks, \"What form is he of?\" And she replies, \"An old man cometh up,  and he is covered with a robe.\" So far, therefore, the wise woman  unquestionably plays the part of a \"medium,\" and Saul is dependent upon  her version of what happens.    The account continues:--       And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with     his face to the ground and did obeisance. And Samuel said to     Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up? And Saul     answered, I am sore distressed: for the Philistines make war     against me, and Elohim is departed from me and answereth me no     more, neither by prophets nor by dreams; therefore I have called     thee that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.     And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing that     Jahveh is departed from thee and is become thine adversary?     And Jahveh hath wrought for himself, as he spake by me, and     Jahveh hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to     thy neighbour, even to David. Because thou obeyedst not the     voice of Jahveh and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon     Amalek, therefore hath Jahveh done this thing unto thee this     day. Moreover, Jahveh will deliver Israel also with thee into     the hands of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy     sons be with me: Jahveh shall deliver the host of Israel also     into the hand of the Philistines. Then Saul fell straightway his     full length upon the earth and was sore afraid because of the     words of Samuel... (v. 14-20).    The statement that Saul \"perceived\" that it was Samuel is not to be  taken to imply that, even now, Saul actually saw the shade of the  prophet, but only"]]]
