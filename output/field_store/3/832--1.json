Twelve months ago, I began to collect the necessary material for the  completion of \"The Story of My Life,\" which my venerated and beloved  friend, Dr. Ryerson, had only left in partial outline. These materials,  in the shape of letters, papers, and documents, were fortunately most  abundant. The difficulty that I experienced was to select from such a  miscellaneous collection a sufficient quantity of suitable matter, which  I could afterwards arrange and group into appropriate chapters. This was  not easily done, so as to form a connected record of the life and  labours of a singularly gifted man, whose name was intimately connected"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#1)"],[1,"at https://www.pgdp.net                                 THE             ORIENTAL           STORY BOOK.

THE CARAVAN.    INTRODUCTION.      In a beautiful distant kingdom, of which there is a saying, that the  sun on its everlasting green gardens never goes down, ruled, from the  beginning of time even to the present day, Queen Phantasie. With full  hands, she used to distribute for many hundred years, the abundance of  her blessings among her subjects, and was beloved and respected by all  who knew her. The heart of the Queen, however, was too great to allow  her to stop at her own land with her charities; she herself, in the  royal attire of her everlasting youth and beauty, descended upon the  earth; for she had heard that there men lived, who passed their lives  in sorrowful seriousness, in the midst of care and toil. Unto these  she had sent the finest gifts out of her kingdom, and ever since the  beauteous Queen came through the fields of earth, men were merry at  their labor, and happy in their seriousness.    Her children, moreover, not less fair and lovely than their royal  mother, she had sent forth to bring happiness to men. One day  Maerchen[A], the eldest daughter of the Queen, came back in haste from  the earth. The mother observed that Maerchen was sorrowful; yes, at  times it would seem to her as if her eyes would be consumed by  weeping.    \"What is the matter with thee, beloved Maerchen?\" said the Queen to  her. \"Ever since thy journey, thou art so sorrowful and dejected; wilt  thou not confide to thy mother what ails thee?\"    \"Ah! dear mother,\" answered Maerchen, \"I would have kept silence, had I  not known that my sorrow is thine also.\"    \"Speak, my daughter!\" entreated the fair Queen. \"Grief is a stone,  which presses down him who bears it alone, but two draw it lightly out  of the way.\"    \"Thou wishest it,\" rejoined Maerchen, \"so listen. Thou knowest how  gladly I associate with men, how cheerfully I sit down before the huts  of the poor, to while away a little hour for them after their labor;  formerly, when I came, they used to ask me kindly for my hand to  salute, and looked upon me afterwards, when I went away, smiling and  contented; but in these days, it is so no longer!\"    \"Poor Maerchen!\" said the Queen as she caressed her cheek, which was  wet with a tear. \"But, perhaps, thou only fanciest all this.\"    \"Believe me, I feel it but too well,\" rejoined Maerchen; \"they love me  no more. Wherever I go, cold looks meet me; nowhere am I any more  gladly seen; even the children, who ever loved me so well, laugh at  me, and slyly turn their backs upon me.\"    The Queen leaned her forehead on her hand, and was silent in  reflection. \"And how, then, Maerchen,\" she asked, \"should it happen  that the people there below have become so changed?\"    \"See, O Queen Phantasie! men have stationed vigilant watchmen, who  inspect and examine all that comes from thy kingdom, with sharp eyes.  If one should arrive who is not according to their mind, they raise a  loud cry, and put him to death, or else so slander him to men, who  believe their every word, that one finds no longer any love, any  little ray of confidence. Ah! how fortunate are my brothers, the  Dreams! they leap merrily and lightly down upon the earth, care  nothing for those artful men, seek the slumbering, and weave and paint  for them, what makes happy the heart, and brightens the eye with joy.\"    \"Thy brothers are light-footed,\" said the Queen, \"and thou, my  darling, hast no reason for envying them. Besides, I know these  border-watchmen well; men are not so wrong in sending them out; there  came so many boastful fellows, who acted as if they had come straight  from my kingdom, and yet they had, at best, only looked down upon us  from some mountain.\"    \"But why did they make me, thine own daughter, suffer for this?\" wept  forth Maerchen. \"Ah, if thou knewest how they have acted towards me!  They called me an old maid, and threatened the next time not to admit  me!\"    \"How, my daughter?--not to admit thee more?\" asked the Queen, as  anger heightened the color on her cheeks. \"But already I see whence  this comes; that wicked cousin has slandered us!\"    \"Fashion? Impossible!\" exclaimed Maerchen; \"she always used to act so  friendly towards us.\"    \"Oh, I know her, the false one!\" answered the Queen. \"But try it again  in spite of her, my daughter: whoever wishes to do good, must not  rest.\"    \"Ah, mother! suppose, then, they send me back again, or slander me so  that men let me stay in a corner, disregarded, or alone and slighted!\"    \"If the old, deluded by Fashion, value thee at nothing, then turn thee  to the young; truly they are my little favorites. I send to them my  loveliest pictures through thy brothers, the Dreams; yes, already I  have often hovered over them in person, caressed and kissed them, and  played fine games with them. They, also, know me well, though not by  name; for I have often observed how in the night they laugh at my  stars, and in the morning, when my shining fleeces play over the  heavens, how they clap their hands for joy. Moreover, when they grow  larger, they love me still; then I help the charming maids to weave  variegated garlands, and the wild boys to become still, while I seat  myself near them, on the lofty summit of a cliff, steep lofty cities  and brilliant palaces in the mist-world of the blue mountains in the  distance, and, on the red-tinged clouds of evening, paint brave troops  of horsemen, and strange pilgrim processions.\"    \"Oh, the dear children!\" exclaimed Maerchen, deeply affected. \"Yes--be  it so! with them I will make one more trial.\"    \"Yes, my good child,\" answered the Queen; \"go unto them; but I will  attire thee in fine style, that thou mayest please the little ones,  and that the old may not drive thee away. See! the dress of an  Almanach[B] will I give thee.\"    \"An Almanach, mother? Ah!--I will be ashamed to parade, in such a way,  before the people.\"    The Queen gave the signal, and the attendants brought in the rich  dress of an Almanach. It was inwrought with brilliant colors, and  beautiful figures. The waiting-maids plaited the long hair of the fair  girl, bound golden sandals on her feet, and arrayed her in the robe.    The modest Maerchen dared not look up; her mother, however, beheld her  with satisfaction, and clasped her in her arms. \"Go forth!\" said she  unto the little one; \"my blessing be with thee. If they despise and  scorn thee, turn quickly unto me; perhaps later generations, more true  to nature, may again incline to thee their hearts.\"    Thus spoke Queen Phantasie, while Maerchen went down upon the earth.  With beating heart she approached the city, in which the cunning  watchmen dwelt: she dropped her head towards the earth, wrapped her  fine robe closely around her, and with trembling step drew near unto  the gate.    \"Hold!\" exclaimed a deep, rough voice. \"Look out, there! Here comes a  new Almanach!\"    Maerchen trembled as she heard this; many old men, with gloomy  countenances, rushed forth; they had sharp quills in their fists, and  held them towards Maerchen. One of the multitude strode up to her, and  seized her with rough hand by the chin. \"Just lift up your head, Mr.  Almanach,\" he cried, \"that one may see in your eyes whether you be  right or not.\"    Blushing, Maerchen lifted her little head quite up, and raised her dark  eye.    \"Maerchen!\" exclaimed the watchmen, laughing boisterously. \"Maerchen!  That we should have had any doubt as to who was here! How come you,  now, by this dress?\"    \"Mother put it on me,\" answered Maerchen.    \"So! she wishes to smuggle you past us! Not this time! Out of the way;  see that you be gone!\" exclaimed the watchmen among themselves,  lifting up their sharp quills.    \"But, indeed, I will go only to the children,\" entreated Maerchen;  \"this, surely, you will grant to me.\"    \"Stay there not, already, enough of these menials in the land around?\"  exclaimed one of the watchmen. \"They only prattle nonsense to our  children.\"    \"Let us see what she knows this time,\" said another.    \"Well then,\" cried they, \"tell us what you know; but make haste, for  we have not much time for you.\"    Maerchen stretched forth her hand, and described with the forefinger,  various figures in the air. Thereupon they saw confused images move  slowly across it;--caravans, fine horses, riders gayly attired,  numerous tents upon the sand of the desert; birds, and ships upon the  stormy seas; silent forests, and populous places, and highways;  battles, and peaceful wandering tribes--all hovered, a motley crowd,  in animated pictures, over before them.    Maerchen, in the eagerness with which she had caused the figures to  rise forth, had not observed that the watchmen of the gate had one by  one fallen asleep. Just as she was about to describe new lines, a  friendly man came up to her, and seized her hand. \"Look here, good  Maerchen,\" said he, as he pointed to the sleepers; \"for these thy  varied creations are as nothing; slip nimbly through the door; they  will not suspect that thou art in the land, and thou canst quietly and  unobserved pursue thy way. I will lead thee unto my children; in my  house will give thee a peaceful, friendly home; there thou mayest  remain and live by thyself; whenever my sons and daughters shall have  learned their lessons well, they shall be permitted to run to thee  with their plays, and attend to thee."]]]
