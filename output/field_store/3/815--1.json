PREFACE.      Having been honoured once again with a request that I should lecture  before the London Institution, I chose for my subject the Theory of  Tidal Evolution. The kind reception which these lectures received has  led to their publication in the present volume. I have taken the  opportunity to supplement the lectures as actually delivered by the  insertion of some additional matter. I am indebted to my friends Mr.  Close and Mr. Rambaut for their kindness in reading the proofs.                                                    ROBERT S. BALL.      _Observatory_, CO. DUBLIN,    _April_ 26, 1889.            TIME AND TIDE.          LECTURE I.      It is my privilege to address you this afternoon on a subject in which  science and poetry are blended in a happy conjunction. If there be a  peculiar fascination about the earlier chapters of any branch of  history, how great must be the interest which attaches to that most  primeval of all terrestrial histories which relates to the actual  beginnings of this globe on which we stand.    In our efforts to grope into the dim recesses of this awful past, we  want the aid of some steadfast light which shall illumine the dark  places without the treachery of the will-o'-the-wisp. In the absence  of that steadfast light, vague conjectures as to the beginning of  things could never be entitled to any more respect than was due to  mere matters of speculation.    Of late, however, the required light has been to some considerable  extent forthcoming, and the attempt has been made, with no little  success, to elucidate a most interesting and wonderful chapter of an  exceedingly remote history. To chronicle this history is the object of  the present lectures before this Institution.    First, let us be fully aware of the extraordinary remoteness of that  period of which our history treats. To attempt to define that period  chronologically would be utterly futile. When we have stated that it  is more ancient than almost any other period which we can discuss, we  have expressed all that we are really entitled to say. Yet this  conveys not a little. It directs us to look back through all the ages  of modern human history, through the great days of ancient Greece and  Rome, back through the times when Egypt and Assyria were names of  renown, through the days when Nineveh and Babylon were mighty and  populous cities in the zenith of their glory. Back earlier still to  those more ancient nations of which we know hardly anything, and  still earlier to the prehistoric man, of whom we know less; back,  finally, to the days when man first trod on this planet, untold ages  ago. Here is indeed a portentous retrospect from most points of view,  but it is only the commencement of that which our subject suggests.    For man is but the final product of the long anterior ages during  which the development of life seems to have undergone an exceedingly  gradual elevation. Our retrospect now takes its way along the vistas  opened up by the geologists. We look through the protracted tertiary  ages, when mighty animals, now generally extinct, roamed over the  continents. Back still earlier through those wondrous secondary  periods, where swamps or oceans often covered what is now dry land,  and where mighty reptiles of uncouth forms stalked and crawled and  swam through the old world and the new. Back still earlier through  those vitally significant ages when the sunbeams were being garnered  and laid aside for man's use in the great forests, which were  afterwards preserved by being transformed into seams of coal. Back  still earlier through endless thousands of years, when lustrous  fishes abounded in the oceans; back again to those periods  characterized by the lower types of life; and still earlier to that  incredibly remote epoch when life itself began to dawn on our  awakening globe. Even here the epoch of our present history can hardly  be said to have been reached. We have to look through a long  succession of ages still antecedent. The geologist, who has hitherto  guided our view, cannot render us much further assistance; but the  physicist is at hand--he teaches us that the warm globe on which life  is beginning has passed in its previous stages through every phase of  warmth, of fervour, of glowing heat, of incandescence, and of actual  fusion; and thus at last our retrospect reaches to that particular  period of our earth's past history which is specially illustrated by  the modern doctrine of Time and Tide.    The present is the clue to the past. It is the steady application of  this principle which has led to such epoch-making labours as those by  which Lyell disclosed the origin of the earth's crust, Darwin the  origin of species, Max Mueller the origin of language. In our present  subject the course is equally clear. Study exactly what is going on at  present, and then have the courage to apply consistently and  rigorously what we have learned from the present to the interpretation  of the past.    Thus we begin with the ripple of the tide on the sea-beach which we  see to-day. The ebb and the flow of the tide are the present  manifestations of an agent which has been constantly at work. Let that  present teach us what tides must have done in the indefinite past.    It has been known from the very earliest times that the moon and the  tides were connected together--connected, I say, for a great advance  had to be made in human knowledge before it would have been possible  to understand the true relation between the tides and the moon.  Indeed, that relation is so far from being of an obvious character,  that I think I have read of a race who felt some doubt as to whether  the moon was the cause of the tides, or the tides the cause of the  moon. I should, however, say that the moon is not the sole agent  engaged in producing this periodic movement of our waters. The sun  also arouses a tide, but the solar tide is so small in comparison with  that produced by the moon, that for our present purpose we may leave  it out of consideration. We must, however, refer to the solar tide at  a later period of our discourses, for it will be found to have played  a very splendid part at the initial stage of the Earth-Moon History,  while in the remote future it will again rise into prominence.    It will be well to set forth a few preliminary figures which shall  explain how it comes to pass that the efficiency of the sun as a  tide-producing agent is so greatly inferior to that of the moon.  Indeed, considering that the sun has a mass so stupendous, that it  controls the entire planetary system, how is it that a body so  insignificant as the moon can raise a bigger tide on the ocean than  can the sun, of which the mass is 26,000,000 times as great as that of  our satellite?    This apparent paradox will disappear when we enunciate the law  according to which the efficiency of a tide-producing agent is to be  estimated. This law is somewhat different from the familiar form in  which the law of gravitation is expressed. The gravitation between two  distant masses is to be measured by multiplying these masses together,  and dividing the product by the _square_ of the distance. The law for  expressing the efficiency of a tide-producing agent varies not  according to the inverse square, but according to the inverse _cube_  of the distance. This difference in the expression of the law will  suffice to account for the superiority of the moon as a tide-producer  over the sun. The moon's distance on an average is about one 386th  part of that of the sun, and thus it is easy to show that so far as  the mere attraction of gravitation is concerned, the efficiency of the  sun's force on the earth is about one hundred and seventy-five times  as great as the force with which the moon attracts the earth. That is  of course calculated under the law of the inverse square. To determine  the tidal efficiency we have to divide this by three hundred and  eighty-six, and thus we see that the tidal efficiency of the sun is  less than half that of the moon.    When the solar tide and the lunar tide are acting in unison, they  conspire to produce very high tides and very low tides, or, as we  call them, spring tides. On the other hand, when the sun is so placed  as to give us a low tide while the moon is producing a high tide, the  net result that we actually experience is merely the excess of the  lunar tide over the solar tide; these are what we call neap tides. In  fact, by very careful and long-continued observations of the rise and  fall of the tides at a particular port, it becomes possible to  determine with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24263"],[0,"A Hundred Anecdotes of Animals (#1)"],[1,"was produced from scanned images of public domain  material from the Google Print project.)

Remorse.      An elephant, from some motive of revenge, killed his _cornack_, or  conductor. The man's wife, who beheld the dreadful scene, took her two  children, and threw them at the feet of the enraged animal, saying, \"Since  you have slain my husband, take my life also, as well as that of my  children.\" The elephant instantly stopped, relented, and as if stung with  remorse, took up the eldest boy with his trunk, placed him on its neck,  adopted him for his _cornack_, and would never afterwards allow any other  person to mount it.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE II.    The Newfoundland Dog.      One of the magistrates in Harbour Grace, in Newfoundland, had an old dog  of the regular web-footed species peculiar to that island, who was in the  habit of carrying a lantern before his master at night, as steadily as the  most attentive servant could do, stopping short when his master made a  stop, and proceeding when he saw him disposed to follow. If his master was  absent from home, on the lantern being fixed to his mouth, and the command  given, \"Go fetch thy master,\" he would immediately set off and proceed  directly to the town, which lay at the distance of more than a mile from  the place of his master's residence: he would then stop at the door of  every house which he knew his master was in the habit of frequenting, and  laying down his lantern, growl and strike the door, making all the noise  in his power until it was opened; if his master was not there, he would  proceed farther in the same manner, until he had found him. If he had  accompanied him only once into a house, this was sufficient to induce him  to take that house in his round.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE III.    Studying.      A magpie, belonging to a barber at Rome, could imitate to a nicety almost  every word it heard. Some trumpets happened one day to be sounded before  the shop, and for a day or two afterwards the magpie was quite mute, and  seemed pensive and melancholy. All who knew it were greatly surprised at  its silence; and it was supposed that the sound of the trumpets had so  stunned it, as to deprive it at once of both voice and hearing. It soon  appeared, however, that this was far from being the case; for the bird had  been all the time occupied in profound meditation, studying how to imitate  the sound of the trumpets; and when at last master of it, the magpie, to  the astonishment of all its friends, suddenly broke its long silence, by a  perfect imitation of the flourish of trumpets it had heard; observing with  the greatest exactness all the repetitions, stops, and changes. The  acquisition of this lesson had, however, exhausted the whole of the  magpie's stock of intellect; for it made it forget everything it had  learned before.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE IV.    A Faithful Companion.      A gardener, in removing some rubbish, discovered two ground toads of an  uncommon size, weighing no less than seven pounds.
