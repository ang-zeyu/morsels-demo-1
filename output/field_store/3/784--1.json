The Mormon orders were to \"kill all who can  talk,\" and, in their carrying out, Lee and his Danites, with  certain Indians whom he had recruited in the name of scalps and  pillage, slaughtered over one hundred and twenty men, women, and  children, and left their stripped bodies to the elements and the  wolves. This wholesale murder was given the title of \"The  Mountain Meadows Massacre.\" Twenty years later, in 1877, the  belated justice of this Government seated Lee on his coffin, and  shot him to death for his crimes.    In those long prison weeks which fell in between his arrest and  execution, Lee wrote his life, giving among other matters the  story of the Church of Mormon from its inception, when Joseph  Smith pretended, with the aid of Urim and Thummim, to translate  the golden plates, down to those murders for which he, Lee, was  executed. Lee's confessions, so to call them, were published  within a few months following his death. The disclosures were  such that the Mormon Church became alarmed; the book might mean  its downfall. In the name of Mormon safety Brigham Young, by  money and other agencies, succeeded in the book's suppression.  What copies had been sold were, as much as might be, bought up  and destroyed, together with the plates and forms from which they  had been printed.    In the destruction of this literature, so perilous to Mormons, at  least two volumes escaped. These have been placed in my hands by  certain patriotic influences, and are here reprinted as The  Mormon Menace. Much that was shocking and atrocious has been  eliminated in the editing, as unfit for modest ears and eyes.  What remains, however, will give a sufficient picture of the  Mormon Church in its hateful attitude towards all that is moral  or republican among our people. A black kitten makes a black cat;  what the Mormon Church was under President Young it is under  President Smith, and will be with their dark successors.    The purpose of the present publication of Lee's story is to warn  American men, and more particularly American women, of the Mormon  viper still coiled upon the national hearth. To-day, as in the  days of Lee, the Mormon missionary is abroad in the world. He is  in your midst; he makes his converts among your neighbors;  within the month, on one detected occasion, he stood at the  portals of your public schools and gave his insidious pamphlets,  preaching Mormonism, into the hands of your children.    More, the Mormon Church has, in addition to its religious, its  political side, and teaches not only immorality, but treason. On  a far-away 5th of November a certain darksome Guy Fawkes and his  confederates, all with a genius for explosives, planned to blow  up the British Government by blowing up its parliament, and went  some distance towards carrying out their plot. The Mormon Church  of Latter-day Saints, with headquarters in Salt Lake City, is  employed upon a present and somewhat similar conspiracy against  this Government, with Senator Smoot as the advance guard or agent  thereof in the halls of our national legislature.    As this is written, a Senate inquiry into this conspiracy wags  slowly yet searchingly forward. Stripped of formality of phrase  and reset in easier English, the question which the Senate  Committee is trying to solve is this: Is the Mormon Church in  conspiracy against the Government, with Senator Smoot's seat as a  first fruit of that conspiracy? As corollary comes the second  query: To which does Senator Smoot give primary allegiance, the  Church or the nation?    By every sign and signal smoke of evidence the conspiracy charged  exists, with President Smith of the Mormon Church its chief  architect and expositor. Smoot takes his seat in the upper house  of Congress with a first purpose of carrying forth, so far as  lies within his hands, the plans of the conspirators. What is the  purpose of the conspirators? To protect themselves and their  fellow Mormons in the criminal practice of polygamy, and prevent  their prosecution as bigamists by the Utah courts.    The inquiry has already uncovered Mormonism in many of its evil  details, and retold most, if not all, of those stories of pious  charlatanism and religious crime which, during seventy-five years  of its existence, make up the annals of the Mormon Church. As a  first proposal it was explained in evidence before the committee  that in no sort had the Mormon Church abated or abandoned  polygamy as either a tenet or a practice. Indeed, the present  conspiracy aims to produce conditions in Utah under which  polygamy may flourish safe from the ax of law. In the old days,  when Brigham Young ruled, the Mormons were safe with sundry  thousands of desert miles between the law and them. Then they  feared nothing save strife within the Church, and that would be  no mighty peril. Brigham Young would put it down with the  Danites. He had his Destroying Angels, himself at their head, and  when a man rebelled he was murdered.    Mormonism is not, when a first fanaticism has subsided, a  religion that would address the popular taste. It is a religion  of gloom, of bitterness, of fear, of iron hand to punish the  recalcitrant. It demands slavish submission on the part of every  man. It insists upon abjection, self-effacement, a surrender of  individuality on the part of every woman. The man is to work and  obey; the woman is to submit and bear children; all are to be for  the Church, of the Church, by the Church, hoping nothing, fearing  nothing, knowing nothing beyond the will of the Church. The money  price of Mormonism is a tithe of the member's income - the Church  takes a tenth. The member may pay in money or in kind; he may  sell and pay his tenth in dollars, or he may bring to the tithing  yard his butter, or eggs, or hay, or wheat, or whatever he shall  raise as the harvest of his labors.    In the old time the President of the Church was the temporal as  well as spiritual head. No one might doubt his \"revelations\" or  dispute his commands without being visited with punishment which  ran from a fine to the death penalty. When outsiders invaded  their regions the Mormons, by command of Brigham Young, struck  them down, as in the Mountain Meadows murders. This was in the  day when the arm of national power was too short to reach them.  Now, when it can reach them, the Church conspires where before it  assassinated, and strives to do by chicane what it aforetime did  by shedding blood. And all to defend itself in the practice of  polygamy!    One would ask why the Mormons set such extravagant store by that  doctrine of many wives. This is the great reason: It serves to  mark the Church members and separate and set them apart from  Gentile influences. Mormonism is the sort of religion that  children would renounce, and converts, when their heat had  cooled, abandon. The women would leave it on grounds of jealousy  and sentiment; the men would quit in a spirit of independence and  a want of superstitious belief in the Prophet's \"revelations.\"  Polygamy prevents this.

On returning from Germany, although  urged by my friends to publish the story of my experiences, I refused,  fearing to do anything which in the smallest degree might prejudice  the case of those still in captivity. There came a day, nevertheless,  when I read that all English people had left \"Altheim.\" The papers  announced that men under forty-five had been interned at Ruhleben, and  those over that age had been sent to Giessen. There seemed, therefore,  no possible object in further withholding the journal, since, after  all, there was nothing in it which could by any possibility affect the  fate of others less fortunate than I. Accordingly I sent my manuscript  to the _Evening Standard_, which accepted it, and published the first  couple of pages. Then, in deference to the wishes of people whose  relations were still at \"Altheim\" (having been sent back from  Giessen), I stopped my diary. However, in view of the daily  revelations in the Press as regards prisoners in Germany, I have come,  after seven months, to the conclusion that nothing I can say will in  any degree make the condition of prisoners there worse. Meanwhile it  is of supreme interest to compare the opinions and conduct of Germans  at the beginning of the war with what they express and observe now. My  journal is simply a record made each day of my detention, and although  it has no pretension to being literature, it is at least a truthful  picture of the state of things as we in Altheim saw them at the  beginning of the war. For obvious reasons the place of detention has  been given a fictitious name.                                               HARRIET J. JEPHSON.

NUR IN LONDON NICHT                            49      _But not in London!_    _These illustrations are reproduced from German newspapers._                                    A WAR-TIME JOURNAL:                               GERMANY, 1914      VILLA BUCHHOLZ, ALTHEIM, _August 1st._--Last night a herald went round  the town and roused everyone, blowing his trumpet and crying, \"Kommen  Sie heraus! Kommen Sie alle fort!\" This was a call to the reservists,  all of whom are leaving Altheim. To-day the crowd cheered madly, sang  \"Heil Dir im Sieger Kranz,\" and \"Deutschland ueber alles,\" showing the  utmost enthusiasm. To my horror, I find that the banks here refuse  foreign cheques, and will have nothing to do with letters of credit. I  have very little ready money with me, and the situation is not a  pleasant one!    _August 2nd._--Germany has declared war against Russia! All men old  enough to serve are leaving to join the army. Proclamations are  posted up in the Park Strasse, and crowds are standing in tense  anxiety in groups, discussing matters with grave faces. We don't know  how to get away, since all trains are to be used only for the troops  while \"mobilmachung\" is going on. People have got as far as the  frontier and been turned back there, and some who left Altheim  yesterday are still at Frankfort. I tried to buy an English paper in  the town, and was told that none were to be had until England had made  up her mind what she was going to do! We think of motor-cars to the  frontier, or the Rhine boat.    _August 3rd._--Alas! all steamers on the Rhine are stopped and  motor-cars are impossible, because an order has come out that  petroleum is to be reserved for the Government. I made another attempt  to cash a cheque to-day, and again the bank refused. A Russian who  stood beside me was desperate. He spoke execrable French, and cried  excitedly: \"Comment donc! je ne puis pas quitter le pays et j'ai une  famille et trois femmes!\" Poor Bluebeard! his \"trois femmes\" (wife and  daughters) looked terrified and miserable. Our position is incredible  and most serious. Still, one cannot but admire the glorious spirit of  sacrifice and patriotism which animates all classes of the German  people. Just what it was in the war of 1813, when women even cut off  their hair and sold it to help their country.    _August 4th._--Troops are marching through the streets and leaving for  the Front all day long. The ladies of Altheim go to the station as the  trains pass through, and give the soldiers coffee, chocolate, cigars,  and zwiebacks. They get much gratitude, and the men say (poor deluded  mortals): \"Wir kriegen fuer Sie\" (We fight for you). I saw poor Frau  G---- (my doctor's wife) to-day. She was quite calm, but looked  miserable. Her eldest son, Dr. T----, left for the front this morning.  I sympathised, and she said, choking back a sob: \"Man gibt das beste  fuer das Vaterland\" (one gives one's best for the Fatherland). No  letters come, nor papers; and we are only allowed to send postcards  written in German.    _August 5th._--Our baker has gone to the war, and Dr. G---- 's butler;  the schools have shut up, so many masters having been called upon to  fight. Even learned professors turn soldiers in this country, and  most of the weedy cabhorses here have left Altheim to serve their  \"Fatherland.\" My Bade-Frau's husband has gone to the front, and so has  our Apotheke; there are no porters left at the station, and a jeweller  is doing duty as station-master! The Red Cross Society meet daily, and  make preparations for the care of wounded men. Hospitals, private  houses, and doctors' houses are getting ready, and all motors have  been put at the State's disposal. Insane hatred against Russia exists,  and the Russians here are not enjoying themselves! My position is most  serious: no money, and no return ticket!    _August 6th._--I went out early in quest of news, and looked in at  K---- and L----'s. A young clerk, pale with excitement and anger, in  reply to my question: \"Gibt es etwas neues?\" literally hissed at me:  \"England hat Krieg erklaert\" (England has declared war). It was an  awful moment, although one was prepared for it in a measure, feeling  sure that England would be faithful to her bond.    Next came the Press announcements, \"Das unglaubliche ist Tatsache  geworden\" (The unbelievable is become an accomplished fact). \"England,  who poses as the guardian of morality and all the virtues, sides with  Russia and assassins!\" Abuse of Sir Edward Grey, of our Government,  and of all things English, follows. When vituperation fails, the  \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" reminds its readers that, after all, such  conduct is only what may be expected from \"Die historische Perfide  Albions.\" That it is a blow none the less is shown by more than one  newspaper beginning \"Das Schlimmste ist geschehen.\" (The worst has  happened.) Miss M----, Miss H----, and I went to the \"Prince of  Wales's Hotel\" to see Mr. S----, who had made out a list of the  English in Altheim, and tried to telephone to our Consul in Frankfort  to ask what he was going to do for our rescue. The telephone people  refused to send the message because we were English! Mr. S---- and  other men here are doing all they can to secure a train when the  mobilisation is over. He advised us to pack up and be ready to start,  also not to show ourselves out of doors much, as there is the greatest  fury and indignation at present against the English, and to be careful  what we said and did. We are all terribly anxious, and it is rather  trying for me, as I am the only woman in the place quite alone.    _August 7th._--Still no help! Innumerable wild rumours are flying  about. They say that those who left Altheim have all come back, unable  to get farther than Frankfort. We are beginning to feel hopeless.  Nothing about England is in the German papers, and, of course, we see  no others. It is quite terrible being without news. Last night there  was great scrubbing and scraping of Altheim shop windows, and "]]]
