He had only a nod for Jimmy Skunk, and even Peter  Rabbit could get no more than a grumpy \"Good morning.\" It wasn't  that he had been caught napping the day before by Reddy Fox and  nearly made an end of. No, it wasn't that. Danny had learned his  lesson, and Reddy would never catch him again. It wasn't that he  was all alone with no one to play with. Danny was rather glad  that he was alone. The fact is, Danny Meadow Mouse was worried.    Now worry is one of the worst things in the world, and it didn't  seem as if there was anything that Danny Meadow Mouse need worry  about. But you know it is the easiest thing in the world to find  something to worry over and make yourself uncomfortable about.  And when you make yourself uncomfortable, you are almost sure to  make everyone around you equally uncomfortable. It was so with  Danny Meadow Mouse. Striped Chipmunk had twice called him \"Cross  Patch\" that morning, and Johnny Chuck, who had fought Reddy Fox  for him the day before, had called him \"Grumpy.\" And what do you  think was the matter with Danny Meadow Mouse? Why, he was  worrying because his tail was short. Yes, Sir, that is all that  ailed Danny Meadow Mouse that bright morning.    You know, some people let their looks make them miserable. They  worry because they are homely or freckled, or short or tall, or  thin or stout, all of which is very foolish. And Danny Meadow  Mouse was just as foolish in worrying because his tail was short.    It is short! It certainly is all of that! Danny never had  realized how short until he chanced to meet his cousin Whitefoot,  who lives in the Green Forest. He was very elegantly dressed, but  the most imposing thing about him was his long, slim, beautiful  tail. Danny had at once become conscious of his own stubby  little tail, and he had hardly had pride enough to hold his head  up as became an honest Meadow Mouse. Ever since, he had been  thinking and thinking, and wondering how his family came to have  such short tails. Then he grew envious and began to wish and wish  and wish that he could have a long tail like his cousin  Whitefoot.    He was so busy wishing that he had a long tail that he quite  forgot to take care of the tail he did have, and he pretty nearly  lost it and his life with it. Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk spied  Danny sitting there moping on his doorstep, and came sailing  over the tops of the meadow grasses so softly that he all but  caught Danny. If it hadn't been for one of the Merry Little  Breezes, Danny would have been caught. And all because he was  envious. It's a bad, bad habit.    [Illustration]                                       II                Danny Meadow Mouse and His Short Tail      All Danny Meadow Mouse could think about was his short tail. He  was so ashamed of it that whenever anyone passed, he crawled out  of sight so that they should not see how short his tail was.  Instead of playing in the sunshine as he used to do, he sat and  sulked. Pretty soon his friends began to pass without stopping.  Finally one day old Mr. Toad sat down in front of Danny and  began to ask questions.    \"What's the matter?\" asked old Mr. Toad.    \"Nothing,\" replied Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"I don't suppose there really is anything the matter, but what do  you think is the matter?\" said old Mr. Toad.    Danny fidgeted, and old Mr. Toad looked up at jolly, round, red  Mr. Sun and winked. \"Sun is just as bright as ever, isn't it?\" he  inquired.    \"Yes,\" said Danny.    \"Got plenty to eat and drink, haven't you?\" continued Mr. Toad.    [Illustration: _\"Got plenty to eat and drink, haven't you?\"  continued Mr. Toad_]    \"Yes,\" said Danny.    \"Seems to me that that is a pretty good-looking suit of clothes  you're wearing,\" said Mr. Toad, eyeing Danny critically. \"Sunny  weather, plenty to eat and drink, and good clothes--must be you  don't know when you're well off, Danny Meadow Mouse.\"    Danny hung his head. Finally he looked up and caught a kindly  twinkle in old Mr. Toad's eyes. \"Mr. Toad, how can I get a long  tail like my cousin Whitefoot of the Green Forest?\" he asked.    \"So that's what's the matter! Ha! ha! ha! Danny Meadow Mouse, I'm  ashamed of you! I certainly am ashamed of you!\" said Mr. Toad.  \"What good would a long tail do you? Tell me that.\"    For a minute Danny didn't know just what to say. \"I--I--I'd look  so much better if I had a long tail,\" he ventured.    Old Mr. Toad just laughed. \"You never saw a Meadow Mouse with a  long tail, did you? Of course not. What a sight it would be! Why,  everybody on the Green Meadows would laugh themselves sick at the  sight! You see, you need to be slim and trim and handsome to  carry a long tail well. And then what a nuisance it would be! You  would always have to be thinking of your tail and taking care to  keep it out of harm's way. Look at me. I'm homely. Some folks  call me ugly to look at. But no one tries to catch me as Farmer  Brown's boy does Billy Mink because of his fine coat; and no one  wants to put me in a cage because of a fine voice. I am satisfied  to be just as I am, and if you'll take my advice, Danny Meadow  Mouse, you'll be satisfied to be just as you are.\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse after a little.  \"I'll try.\"                                       III               Danny Meadow Mouse Plays Hide-and-Seek      Life is always a game of hide-and-seek to Danny Meadow Mouse. You  see, he is such a fat little fellow that there are a great many  other furry-coated people, and almost as many who wear feathers,  who would gobble Danny up for breakfast or for dinner if they  could.

Strong for the red rage of battle; sane, for I harry them sore;      Send me men girt for the combat, men who are grit to the core;      Swift as the panther in triumph, fierce as the bear in defeat,      Sired of a bulldog parent, steeled in the furnace heat.      Send me the best of your breeding, lend me your chosen ones;      Them will I take to my bosom, them will I call my sons;      Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat;      But the others--the misfits, the failures--I trample under my feet.      Dissolute, damned, and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,      Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters--Go! take back your spawn            again.        \"Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;      From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a            day;      Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come:      Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept--the scum.      The pallid pimp of the dead-line, the enervate of the pen,      One by one I weeded them out, for all that I sought was--Men.      One by one I dismayed them, frighting them sore with my glooms;      One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms.      Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my            plains,      Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;      Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,      Lashed them with fungus-white faces, whimpering wild in the night;      Staggering blind through the storm-whirl, stumbling mad through the            snow,      Frozen stiff in the ice pack, brittle and bent like a bow;      Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,      Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;      Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,      Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;      Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam;      Writing a cheque for a million, drivelling feebly of home;      Lost like a louse in the burning ... or else in tented town      Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;      Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,      Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;      In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,      Its gambling dens a-riot, its gramophones all a-blare;      Crimped with the crimes of a city, sin-ridden and bridled with lies,      In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight            skies.      Plague-spots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them            thrive,      Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.        \"But the others, the men of my mettle, the men who would 'stablish            my fame,      Unto its ultimate issue, winning me honour, not shame;      Searching my uttermost valleys, fighting each step as they go,      Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow;      Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks,      Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks.      I am the land that listens, I am the land that broods;      Steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods.      Long have I waited lonely, shunned as a thing accurst,      Monstrous, moody, pathetic, the last of the lands and the first;      Visioning camp-fires at twilight, sad with a longing forlorn,      Feeling my womb o'er-pregnant with the seed of cities unborn.      Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,      And I wait for the men who will win me--and I will not be won in a day;      And I will not be won by weaklings, subtile, suave, and mild,      But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;      Desperate, strong, and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,      Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat.        \"Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise,      With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet, passionless eyes;      Dreaming alone of a people, dreaming alone of a day,      When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away;      Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave--      Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path and I stamp them            into a grave.      Dreaming of men who will bless me, of women esteeming me good,      Of children born in my borders, of radiant motherhood;      Of cities leaping to stature, of fame like a flag unfurled,      As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world.\"        This is the Law of the Yukon, that only the Strong shall thrive;      That surely the Weak shall perish, and only the Fit survive.      Dissolute, damned, and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,      This is the Will of the Yukon,--Lo! how she makes it plain!          THE PARSON'S SON          _This is the song of the parson's son, as he squats in his shack alone,      On the wild, weird nights when the Northern Lights shoot up from the            frozen zone,      And it's sixty below, and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan._        \"I'm one of the Arctic brotherhood, I'm an old-time pioneer.      I came with the first--O God! how I've cursed this Yukon--but still            I'm here.      I've sweated athirst in its summer heat, I've frozen and starved in            its cold;      I've followed my dreams by its thousand streams, I've toiled and            moiled for its gold.        \"Look at my eyes--been snow-blind twice; look where my foot's half            gone;      And that gruesome scar on my left cheek where the frost-fiend bit to            the bone.      Each one a brand of this devil's land, where I've played and I've     "]]]
