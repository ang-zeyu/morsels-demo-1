THE EXAMINATION OF A SICK HORSE.    By Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.      In the examination of a sick horse it is important to have a method or  system. If a definite plan of examination is followed one may feel  reasonably sure, when the examination is finished, that no important  point has been overlooked and that the examiner is in a position to  arrive at an opinion that is as accurate as is possible for him. Of  course, an experienced eye can see, and a trained hand can feel, slight  alterations or variations from the normal that are not perceptible to  the unskilled observer. A thorough knowledge of the conditions that  exist in health is of the highest importance, because it is only by a  knowledge of what is right that one can surely detect a wrong condition.  A knowledge of anatomy, or of the structure of the body, and of  physiology, or the functions and activities of the body, lie at the  bottom of accuracy of diagnosis. It is important to remember that  animals of different races or families deport themselves differently  under the influence of the same disease or pathological process. The  sensitive and highly organized thoroughbred resists cerebral depression  more than does the lymphatic draft horse. Hence a degree of fever that  does not produce marked dullness in a thoroughbred may cause"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2343"],[0,"The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge (#1)"],[1,"Adventure of Wisteria Lodge      by    Sir Arthur Conan Doyle          CONTENTS      1. The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles    2. The Tiger of San Pedro          1.  The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles        I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day  towards the end of March in the year 1892.  Holmes had received a  telegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply.  He  made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood  in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his  pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message.  Suddenly he  turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.    \"I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,\" said  he.  \"How do you define the word 'grotesque'?\"    \"Strange--remarkable,\" I suggested.    He shook his head at my definition.    \"There is surely something more than that,\" said he; \"some underlying  suggestion of the tragic and the terrible.  If you cast your mind back  to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a  long-suffering public, you will recognize how often the grotesque has  deepened into the criminal.  Think of that little affair of the  red-headed men.  That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it  ended in a desperate attempt at robbery.  Or, again, there was that  most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a  murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.\"    \"Have you it there?\" I asked.    He read the telegram aloud.    \"Have just had most incredible and grotesque experience.  May I consult  you?    \"Scott Eccles,    \"Post Office, Charing Cross.\"      \"Man or woman?\" I asked.    \"Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram.  She would have come.\"    \"Will you see him?\"    \"My dear Watson, you know how bored I have been since we locked up  Colonel Carruthers.  My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to  pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was  built.  Life is commonplace, the papers are sterile; audacity and  romance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world.  Can you  ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any new problem, however  trivial it may prove?  But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.\"    A measured step was heard upon the stairs, and a moment later a stout,  tall, gray-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into  the room.  His life history was written in his heavy features and  pompous manner.  From his spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a  Conservative, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to  the last degree. But some amazing experience had disturbed his native  composure and left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed, angry  cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He plunged instantly into his  business.    \"I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr. Holmes,\"  said he.  \"Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation.  It  is most improper--most outrageous.  I must insist upon some  explanation.\"  He swelled and puffed in his anger.    \"Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,\" said Holmes in a soothing voice.  \"May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?\"    \"Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the  police, and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I  could not leave it where it was.  Private detectives are a class with  whom I have absolutely no sympathy, but none the less, having heard  your name--\"    \"Quite so.  But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?\"    Holmes glanced at his watch.    \"It is a quarter-past two,\" he said.  \"Your telegram was dispatched  about one.  But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without  seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.\"    Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin.    \"You are right, Mr. Holmes.  I never gave a thought to my toilet. I was  only too glad to get out of such a house.  But I have been running  round making inquiries before I came to you.  I went to the house  agents, you know, and they said that Mr. Garcia's rent was paid up all  right and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.\"    \"Come, come, sir,\" said Holmes, laughing.  \"You are like my friend, Dr.  Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost.  Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence,  exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and  unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of  advice and assistance.\"    Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional  appearance.    \"I'm sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that in  my whole life such a thing has ever happened before.  But I will tell you  the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I am  sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.\"    But his narrative was nipped in the bud.  There was a bustle outside,  and Mrs. Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and  official-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as  Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic, gallant, and, within  his limitations, a capable officer.  He shook hands with Holmes and  introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Constabulary.    \"We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our trail lay in this  direction.\"  He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor.  \"Are you Mr.  John Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?\"    \"I am.\"    \"We have been following you about all the morning.\"    \"You traced him through the telegram, no doubt,\" said Holmes.    \"Exactly, Mr. Holmes.  We picked up the scent at Charing Cross  Post-Office and came on here.\"    \"But why do you follow me?  What do you want?\"    \"We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to the events which led up  to the death last night of Mr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near  Esher.\"    Our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour  struck from his astonished face.    \"Dead?  Did you say he was dead?\"    \"Yes, sir, he is dead.\"    \"But how?  An accident?\"    \"Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.\"    \"Good God!  This is awful!  You don't mean--you don't mean that I am  suspected?\"    \"A letter of yours was found in the dead man's pocket, and we know by  it that you had planned to pass last night at his house.\"    \"So I did.\"    \"Oh, you did, did you?\"    Out came the official notebook.    \"Wait a bit, Gregson,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"All you desire is a  plain statement, is it not?\"    \"And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used against  him.\"    \"Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room.  I  think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I  suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience, and  that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had  you never been interrupted.\"    Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to  his face.  With a dubious glance at the inspector's notebook, he  plunged at once into his extraordinary statement.    \"I am a bachelor,\" said he, \"and being of a sociable turn I cultivate a  large number of friends.  Among these are the family of a retired  brewer called Melville, living at Abermarle Mansion, Kensington.  It  was at his table that I met some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia.  He was, I understood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with  the embassy.  He spoke perfect English, was pleasing in his manners,  and as good-looking a man as ever I saw in my life.    \"In some way we struck up quite a friendship, this young fellow and I.  He seemed to take a fancy to me from the first, and within two days of  our meeting he came to see me at Lee.  One thing led to another, and it  ended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria  Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott.  Yesterday evening I went to Esher to  fulfil this engagement.    \"He had described his household to me before I went there.  He lived  with a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all  his needs.  This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping  for him.  Then there was a wonderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom  he had picked up in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner.  I remember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in  the heart of Surrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has proved a  good deal queerer than I thought.    \"I drove to the place--about two miles on the south side of Esher.  The  house was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving  drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs.  It was an old,  tumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair.  When the trap  pulled up on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and  weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man  whom I knew so slightly.  He opened the door himself, however, and  greeted me with a great show of cordiality.  I was handed over to the  manservant, a melancholy, swarthy individual, who led the way, my bag  in his hand, to my bedroom.  The whole place was depressing.  Our  dinner was tete-a-tete, and though my host did his best to be  entertaining, his thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked  so vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand him. He  continually drummed his fingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and  gave other signs of nervous impatience.  The dinner itself was neither  well served nor well cooked, and the gloomy presence of the taciturn  servant did not help to enliven us.  I can assure you that many times  in the course of the evening I wished that I could invent some excuse  which "]]]
