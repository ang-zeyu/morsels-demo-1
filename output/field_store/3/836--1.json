[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2465"],[0,"Carmen (#1)"],[1,"by Prosper Merimee      Translated by Lady Mary Loyd          CHAPTER I    I had always suspected the geographical authorities did not know what  they were talking about when they located the battlefield of Munda in  the county of the Bastuli-Poeni, close to the modern Monda, some two  leagues north of Marbella.    According to my own surmise, founded on the text of the anonymous author  of the _Bellum Hispaniense_, and on certain information culled from the  excellent library owned by the Duke of Ossuna, I believed the site of  the memorable struggle in which Caesar played double or quits, once and  for all, with the champions of the Republic, should be sought in the  neighbourhood of Montilla.    Happening to be in Andalusia during the autumn of 1830, I made a  somewhat lengthy excursion, with the object of clearing up certain  doubts which still oppressed me. A paper which I shall shortly publish  will, I trust, remove any hesitation that may still exist in the minds  of all honest archaeologists. But before that dissertation of mine  finally settles the geographical problem on the solution of which the  whole of learned Europe hangs, I desire to relate a little tale. It will  do no prejudice to the interesting question of the correct locality of  Monda.    I had hired a guide and a couple of horses at Cordova, and had  started on my way with no luggage save a few shirts, and Caesar's  _Commentaries_. As I wandered, one day, across the higher lands of the  Cachena plain, worn with fatigue, parched with thirst, scorched by a  burning sun, cursing Caesar and Pompey's sons alike, most heartily, my  eye lighted, at some distance from the path I was following, on a little  stretch of green sward dotted with reeds and rushes. That betokened the  neighbourhood of some spring, and, indeed, as I drew nearer I perceived  that what had looked like sward was a marsh, into which a stream, which  seemed to issue from a narrow gorge between two high spurs of the Sierra  di Cabra, ran and disappeared.    If I rode up that stream, I argued, I was likely to find cooler water,  fewer leeches and frogs, and mayhap a little shade among the rocks.    At the mouth of the gorge, my horse neighed, and another horse,  invisible to me, neighed back. Before I had advanced a hundred paces,  the gorge suddenly widened, and I beheld a sort of natural amphitheatre,  thoroughly shaded by the steep cliffs that lay all around it. It was  impossible to imagine any more delightful halting place for a traveller.  At the foot of the precipitous rocks, the stream bubbled upward and fell  into a little basin, lined with sand that was as white as snow. Five or  six splendid evergreen oaks, sheltered from the wind, and cooled by the  spring, grew beside the pool, and shaded it with their thick foliage.  And round about it a close and glossy turf offered the wanderer a better  bed than he could have found in any hostelry for ten leagues round.    The honour of discovering this fair spot did not belong to me. A man was  resting there already--sleeping, no doubt--before I reached it. Roused  by the neighing of the horses, he had risen to his feet and had moved  over to his mount, which had been taking advantage of its master's  slumbers to make a hearty feed on the grass that grew around. He was an  active young fellow, of middle height, but powerful in build, and proud  and sullen-looking in expression. His complexion, which may once have  been fine, had been tanned by the sun till it was darker than his hair.  One of his hands grasped his horse's halter. In the other he held a  brass blunderbuss.    At the first blush, I confess, the blunderbuss, and the savage looks  of the man who bore it, somewhat took me aback. But I had heard so much  about robbers, that, never seeing any, I had ceased to believe in their  existence. And further, I had seen so many honest farmers arm themselves  to the teeth before they went out to market, that the sight of firearms  gave me no warrant for doubting the character of any stranger. \"And  then,\" quoth I to myself, \"what could he do with my shirts and my  Elzevir edition of Caesar's _Commentaries_?\" So I bestowed a friendly  nod on the man with the blunderbuss, and inquired, with a smile, whether  I had disturbed his nap. Without any answer, he looked me over from  head to foot. Then, as if the scrutiny had satisfied him, he looked as  closely at my guide, who was just coming up. I saw the guide turn pale,  and pull up with an air of evident alarm. \"An unlucky meeting!\" thought  I to myself. But prudence instantly counselled me not to let any symptom  of anxiety escape me. So I dismounted. I told the guide to take off the  horses' bridles, and kneeling down beside the spring, I laved my head  and hands and then drank a long draught, lying flat on my belly, like  Gideon's soldiers.    Meanwhile, I watched the stranger, and my own guide. This last seemed to  come forward unwillingly. But the other did not appear to have any evil  designs upon us. For he had turned his horse loose, and the blunderbuss,  which he had been holding horizontally, was now dropped earthward.    Not thinking it necessary to take offence at the scant attention paid  me, I stretched myself full length upon the grass, and calmly asked the  owner of the blunderbuss whether he had a light about him. At the same  time I pulled out my cigar-case. The stranger, still without opening his  lips, took out his flint, and lost no time in getting me a light. He was  evidently growing tamer, for he sat down opposite to me, though he still  grasped his weapon. When I had lighted my cigar, I chose out the best I  had left, and asked him whether he smoked.    \"Yes, senor,\" he replied. These were the first words I had heard him  speak, and I noticed that he did not pronounce the letter _s_* in the  Andalusian fashion, whence I concluded he was a traveller, like myself,  though, maybe, somewhat less of an archaeologist.         * The Andalusians aspirate the _s_, and pronounce it like       the soft _c_ and the _z_, which Spaniards pronounce like the       English _th_. An Andalusian may always be recognised by the       way in which he says _senor_.    \"You'll find this a fairly good one,\" said I, holding out a real Havana  regalia.    He bowed his head slightly, lighted his cigar at mine, thanked me  with another nod, and began to smoke with a most lively appearance of  enjoyment.    \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, as he blew his first puff of smoke slowly out of his  ears and nostrils. \"What a time it is since I've had a smoke!\"    In Spain the giving and accepting of a cigar establishes bonds of  hospitality similar to those founded in Eastern countries on the  partaking of bread and salt. My friend turned out more talkative than  I had hoped. However, though he claimed to belong to the _partido_ of  Montilla, he seemed very ill-informed about the country. He did not know  the name of the delightful valley in which we were sitting, he could  not tell me the names of any of the neighbouring villages, and when I  inquired whether he had not noticed any broken-down walls, broad-rimmed  tiles, or carved stones in the vicinity, he confessed he had never paid  any heed to such matters. On the other hand, he showed himself an expert  in horseflesh, found fault with my mount--not a difficult affair--and  gave me a pedigree of his own, which had come from the famous stud at  Cordova. It was a splendid creature, indeed, so tough, according to  its owner's claim, that it had once covered thirty leagues in one day,  either at the gallop or at full trot the whole time. In the midst of his  story the stranger pulled up short, as if startled and sorry he had said  so much. \"The fact is I was in a great hurry to get to Cordova,\" he  went on, somewhat embarrassed. \"I had to petition the judges about a  lawsuit.\" As he spoke, he looked at my guide Antonio, who had dropped  his eyes.    The spring and the cool shade were so delightful that I bethought me  of certain slices of an excellent ham, which my friends at Montilla had  packed into my guide's wallet. I bade him produce them, and invited the  stranger to share our impromptu lunch. If he had not smoked for a long  time, he certainly struck me as having fasted for eight-and-forty hours  at the very least. He ate like a starving wolf, and I thought to myself  that my appearance must really have been quite providential for the poor  fellow. Meanwhile my guide ate but little, drank still less, and spoke  never a word, although in the earlier part of our journey he had proved  himself a most unrivalled chatterer. He seemed ill at ease in the  presence of our guest, and a sort of mutual distrust, the cause of which  I could not exactly fathom, seemed to be between them.    The last crumbs of bread and scraps of ham had disappeared. We had each  smoked our second cigar; I told the guide to bridle the horses, and was  just about to take leave of my new friend, when he inquired where I was  going to spend the night.    Before I had time to notice a sign my guide was making to me I had  replied that I was going to the Venta del Cuervo.    \"That's a bad lodging for a gentleman like you, sir! I'm bound there  myself, and if you'll allow me to ride with you, we'll go together.\"    \"With pleasure!\" I replied, mounting my horse. The guide, who was  holding my stirrup, looked at me meaningly again. I answered by  shrugging my shoulders, as though to assure him I was perfectly easy in  my mind, and we started on our way.    Antonio's mysterious signals, his evident anxiety, a few words dropped  by the stranger, above all, his ride of thirty leagues, and the far from  plausible explanation he had given us of it, had already enabled me  to form an opinion as to the identity of my fellow-traveller. I had  no doubt at all I was in the company of a smuggler, and possibly of a  brigand. What cared I?

When Orlando and his Paladins were overcome at Roncisvalle through the  treachery of Gano di Magonza, were they all slain?  When \"the Crusaders'  streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise,\" did none  linger?  When the angel carried up to heaven the soul of Guido Santo, did  he never fight another battle?  The young men of your island hardly think  so; their thoughts and actions are still coloured by the magnificent  language and the chivalrous exploits of Christian and Turk.  As long as  there is an imaginative shoeblack in the Quattro Canti working for  pennies by day, so long will those pennies be paid for the story to be  told by night in the marionette theatre.  Often will Angelica recover her  ring, and as often be robbed of it again; often will the ghostly voice of  Astolfo, imprisoned in a myrtle upon Alcina's magic isle, reveal the  secret of his woe; often will Rinaldo drink of the Fountains of Hatred  and of Love, and, forgetful of the properties of those waters, return and  drink once more.    And what of those other and less heroic figures--the brigadier and his  guards gambling among the ruins of Selinunte, the ingenious French  gentleman classifying the procession at Calatafimi, Micio buying his  story-books and chocolate at Castellinaria, and many another whom I  should like to think you will some day meet, palely wandering up and down  these pages?    To pursue the subject might disincline you ever to take leave of the  world of the unborn, whereas I am desirous of making your acquaintance as  soon as possible.  Let me, then, rather assure you that life is not all  marionettes and metaphysics, and that I know of no reason why you should  not at once enter upon an existence as real as that enjoyed by your dear  father or your beautiful mother--it would be unbecoming in a son to  expect more.  Castellinaria is waiting to welcome you.  You could not  have a more delightful birthplace than your native town, or more charming  compatriots than your fellow-townspeople.  Only resemble your parents,  and you will never regret having hastened the day when I shall be  entitled to sign myself                                                  Your affectionate Godfather,                                                        HENRY FESTING JONES.          NOTE      Chapters VIII-XI have been enlarged and re-written since August, 1903,  when they appeared as _A Festa on Mount Eryx_ in _The Monthly Review_.  I  have to thank Mr. John Murray for kindly giving me permission to reprint  them here.    A few sentences in Chapter XIII have been taken from a pamphlet I wrote  and had printed for private circulation in 1904, entitled: _Diary of a  Journey through North Italy to Sicily in the spring of 1903_, _undertaken  for the purpose of leaving the MSS. of three books by Samuel Butler at  Varallo-Sesia_, _Aci-Reale and Trapani_.    It would be impossible to enumerate and thank all the many friends who,  with the courtesy and patience that never desert a Sicilian, have given  me information, explanation and assistance.  Among them are two, however,  to whom, and to whose families, I desire to give my special thanks,  namely: Cavaliere Uffiziale Giovanni Grasso, of the Teatro Macchiavelli,  Catania; and Signor Achille Greco, of the Marionette Theatre, in the  Piazza Nuova, Palermo.    Signor Greco wrote to me recently that, for Rosina's riddle in his  episode of the masks in _Samson_, he had dipped in the stream of  children's games current to-day in Palermo; he did not appear to know  that Plato had dipped in his own Athenian stream for the riddle quoted by  Glaucon towards the end of the fifth book of the _Republic_.  The riddles  are similar not because Rosina had read the dialogue, nor because Glaucon  had seen the play, but because the two streams flowed as one until Greek  colonists took their folk-lore with them into Sicily before Plato was  born.

BRANCACCIA                       317  SELINUNTE      CHAPTER I--THE BRIGADIER AND THE LOTTERY      One wet Saturday evening in May I found myself at Castelvetrano  consulting Angelo, the guide, about the weather.  His opinion was that it  would clear up during the night; I said that if it did we would go to  Selinunte, and this confirmed his view; so, on the understanding that  there was to be no rain, I appointed him padrone of the expedition and  promised to acquiesce in all his arrangements.    He was quite right; Sunday morning was brilliantly fine, and at about  8.30 we started.  He began by showing me his purchases; he had been out  early, marketing, and his basket contained fresh tunny, the first of the  season, veal, salame, dried fish, bread and oranges, but no wine; he said  we should find that at the locanda, where they would cook the tunny and  the veal for us.    Cicciu, our driver, was one of those queer creatures one sometimes meets  in Italy.  At first I took him to be of feeble intellect, for when I  spoke to him or merely looked at him, he shut up his eyes, showed his  teeth and covered his face all over with grinning wrinkles; but on  knowing him better, I found he was really extremely intelligent and  perfectly good.  He was about sixteen, but would have passed for twenty.  His general appearance was grey, the actual colour of his face, hands and  clothes being powdered out of sight by the dust which held all together  like a transparent glaze over a painting.  He drove us along between  flowery fields of cistus until the temples of Selinunte came in sight,  then down to the Marinella, a handful of houses on the shore under the  low cliff.  We drew up at the locanda which distinguished itself by  displaying over the door, in a five-ounce medicine bottle, a sample of a  cloudy, canary-coloured fluid to advertise the wine Angelo had spoken of,  and the forlorn bunch of five or six faded sprigs of camomile which hung  on the same hook constituted the bush.  We left our basket with  instructions and drove off to inspect the acropolis and the ruins,  returning in about an hour and a half.    The locanda was an immense, cavernous room divided into front and back by  a partition about seven feet high with an opening in the middle.  There  was no regular window, but we were only a few feet from the sea which  reflected the sunshine through the open door and up into the arched roof  and illuminated the front part.  In the obscurity behind the partition  were dim ladders leading up to trap-doors and, through a few holes in the  roof and in the end wall, blinding rays of light glinted on piles of  earthenware--saucepans, jugs, cups and saucers, coloured crockery lamps,  rough basins glazed green inside, heaped up in stacks and protected from  one another by straw.  There were hanks of rope, fans of hawks' feathers  for blowing the fire, palm-leaf brooms and oil-jars big enough for  thieves.  There were horns on the walls to keep off the evil eye, prints  of the Madonna, some with sprigs of camomile stuck into the frame, a  cheapissimo coloured lithograph of S. Giuseppe with the Bambino, and in  front of it on a little bracket, in"]]]
