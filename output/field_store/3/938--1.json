In that land of which we have so many records of early and high  civilisation, and also such strong evidences of present barbarism,--the  land of which we know so much and so little,--the land where Nature  exhibits some of her most wonderful creations and greatest contrasts,  and where she is also prolific in the great forms of animal and  vegetable life,--there, my young reader, let us wander once more.  Let  us return to Africa, and encounter new scenes in company with old  friends.    On the banks of the Limpopo brightly blazes a hunter's fire, around  which the reader may behold three distinct circles of animated beings.  The largest is composed of horses, the second of dogs, and the lesser or  inner one, of young men, whom many of my readers will recognise as old  acquaintances.    I have but to mention the names of Hans and Hendrik Von Bloom, Groot  Willem and Arend Van Wyk, to make known that _The Young Yagers_ are  again on a hunting expedition.  In the one in which we now encounter  them, not all the parties are inspired by the same hopes and desires.    The quiet and learned Hans Von Bloom, like many colonial youths, is  affected with the desire of visiting the home of his forefathers.  He  wishes to go to Europe for the purpose of making some practical use of  the knowledge acquired, and the floral collections made, while a  _Bush-Boy_ and a _Young Yager_.  But before doing so, he wishes to  enlarge his knowledge of natural history by making one more expedition  to a part of Southern Africa he has not yet visited.    He knows that extensive regions of his native land, containing large  rivers and immense forests, and abounding in a vast variety of rare  plants, lie between the rivers Limpopo and Zambezi, and before visiting  Europe he wishes to extend his botanic researches in that direction.  His desire to make his new excursion amid the African wilds is no  stronger than that of \"Groot Willem\" Van Wyk, who ever since his return  from the last expedition, six months before, has been anxious to  undertake another in quest of game such as he has not yet encountered.    Our readers will search in vain around the camp-fire for little Jan and  Klaas.  Their parents would not consent to their going so far from home,  on an excursion promising so many hardships and so much danger.  Besides, it was necessary that they should become something better than  mere _Bush-Boys_, by spending a few years at school.    The two young cornets, Hendrik Von Bloom and Arend Van Wyk, each  endeavouring to wear the appearance of old warriors, are present in the  camp.  Although both are passionately fond of a sportsman's life, each,  for certain reasons, had refrained from urging the necessity or  advantage of the present expedition.    They would have preferred remaining at home and trying to find amusement  during the day with the inferior game to be found near Graaf Reinet,--  not that they fear danger or were in any way entitled to the appellation  of \"cockney sportsmen\"; but home has an attraction for them that the  love of adventure cannot wholly eradicate.    Hendrik Von Bloom could have stayed very happily at home.  The  excitement of the chase, which on former occasions he had so much  enjoyed, now no longer attracts him half so much as the smiles of  Wilhelmina Van Wyk, the only sister of his friends Groot Willem and  Arend.    The latter young gentleman would not have travelled far from the daily  society of little Truey Von Bloom, had he been left to his own  inclinations.  But Willem and Hans had determined upon seeking  adventures farther to the north than any place they had yet visited; and  hence the present expedition.    The promise of sport and rare adventures, added to the fear of ridicule  should they remain at home, influenced Hendrik and Arend to accompany  the great hunter and the naturalist to the banks of the Limpopo.    Seated near the fire are two other individuals, whom the readers of _The  Young Yagers_ will recognise as old acquaintances.  One is the short,  stout, heavy-headed Bushman, Swartboy, who could not have been coaxed to  remain behind while his young masters Hans and Hendrik were out in  search of adventures.    The other personage not mentioned by name is Congo, the Kaffir.    The Limpopo River was too far from Graaf Reinet for the young hunters to  think of reaching it with wagons and oxen.  The journey might be made,  but it would take up too much time; and they were impatient to reach  what Groot Willem had long called \"The Promised Land.\"    In order, therefore, to do their travelling in as little time as  possible, they had taken no oxen; but, mounted on good horses, had  hastened by the nearest route to the banks of the Limpopo, avoiding in  place of seeking adventures by the way.  Besides their own  saddle-horses, six others were furnished with pack-saddles, and lightly  laden with ammunition, clothing, and such other articles as might be  required.  The camp where we now encounter them is a temporary  halting-place on the Limpopo.  They have succeeded in crossing the  river, and are now on the borders of that land so long represented to  them as being a hunter's paradise.  A toilsome journey is no longer  before them; but only amusement, of a kind so much appreciated that they  have travelled several hundred miles to enjoy it.    We have stated that, in undertaking this expedition, the youths were  influenced by different motives.  This was to a great extent true; and  yet they had a common purpose beside that of mere amusement.  The consul  for the Netherlands had been instructed by his government to procure a  young male and female giraffe, to be forwarded to Europe.  Five hundred  pounds had been offered for the pair safely delivered either at Cape  Town or Port Natal; and several parties of hunters that had tried to  procure these had failed.  They had shot and otherwise killed  camelopards by the score, but had not succeeded in capturing any young  ones alive.    Our hunters had left home with the determination to take back a pair of  young giraffes, and to pay all expenses of their expedition by this, as  also by the sale of hippopotamus teeth.  The hope was not an  unreasonable one.  They knew that fortunes had been made in procuring  elephants' tusks, and also that the teeth of the hippopotamus were the  finest of ivory, and commanded a price four times greater than any other  sent to the European market.    But the capturing of the young camelopards was the principal object of  their expedition.  The love of glory was stronger than the desire of  gain, especially in Groot Willem, who as a hunter eagerly longed to  accomplish a feat which had been attempted by so many others without  success.  In his mind, the fame of fetching back the two young giraffes  far outweighed the five hundred pound prize to be obtained, though the  latter was a consideration not to be despised, and no doubt formed with  him, as with the others, an additional incentive.        CHAPTER TWO.    ON THE LIMPOPO.    During the first night spent upon the Limpopo our adventurers had good  reason for believing that they were in the neighbourhood of several  kinds of game they were anxious to fall in with.    Their repose was disturbed by a combination of sounds, in which they  could distinguish the roar of the lion, the trumpet-like notes of the  elephant, mingled with the voices of some creature they could not  remember having previously heard.    Several hours of that day had been passed in searching for a place to  cross the river,--one where the banks were low on each side, and the  stream not too deep.  This had not been found until the sun was low down  upon the horizon.    By the time they had got safely over, twilight was fast thickening into  darkness, and all but Congo were unwilling to proceed farther that  night.  The Kaffir suggested that they should go at least half a mile up  or down the river and Groot Willem seconded the proposal, although he  had no other reason for doing so than a blind belief in the opinions of  his attendant, whether they were based upon wisdom or instinct.  In the  end Congo's suggestion had been adopted, and the sounds that disturbed  the slumbers of the camp were heard at some distance, proceeding from  the place where they had crossed the river.    \"Now, can you understand why Congo advised us to come here?\" asked Groot  Willem, as they listened to the hideous noises that were depriving them  of sleep.    \"No,\" was the reply of his companions.    \"Well, it was because the place where we crossed is the watering-place  for all the animals in the neighbourhood.\"    \"That is so, Baas Willem,\" said Congo, confirming the statement of his  master.    \"But we have not come a thousand miles for the sake of keeping out of  the way of those animals, have we?\" asked the hunter Hendrik.    \"No,\" answered Willem, \"we came here to seek them, not to have them seek  us.  Our horses want rest, whether we do or not.\"    Here ended further conversation for the night, for the hunters becoming  accustomed to the chorus of the wild creatures, took no further notice  of it, and one after another fell asleep.    Morning dawned upon a scene of surpassing beauty.  They were in a broad  valley, covered with magnificent trees, among which were many gigantic  baobabs (_Adansonia digitata_).  Wild date-trees were growing in little  clumps; while the floral carpet, spread in brilliant pattern over the  valley, was observed by Hans with an air of peculiar satisfaction.    He had reached a new field for the pursuit of his studies, and bright  dreams were passing gently through his mind,--dreams that anticipated  new discoveries in the botanical world, which might make his name known  among the savants of Europe.

The wild ponds are very apt to  be shallow and muddy, with low, marshy shores; but this one was deep and  clear, and its high banks were clothed with a splendid growth of beech,  maple and birch. Tall elms stood guard along the water's edge, and here  and there the hardwood forest was broken by dark hemlock groves, and  groups of lordly pine-trees, lifting their great green heads high above  their deciduous neighbors. Only in one place, around the extreme eastern  end, the ground was flat and wet; and there the tamarack swamp showed  golden yellow in October, and light, delicate green in late spring. Wild  morning-glories grew on the grassy point that put out from the northern  shore, and in the bays the white water-lilies were blossoming. Nearly  two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, it lay basking and  shimmering in the sunshine, a big, broad, beautiful sheet of water set  down in the very heart of the woods._    _There were no settlers anywhere near, nor even any Indians, yet there  was no lack of inhabitants. Bears and wolves and a host of smaller  animals were to be found, and along the shores were runways that had  been worn deep in the soil by the tread of generation after generation  of dainty little cloven hoofs. I suppose that some of those paths have  been used by the deer for hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of years._    _The lands around the entire lake were offered for sale by the United  States Government at the ridiculously low price which Uncle Sam has  asked for most of his possessions; and with the help of some friends my  father bought the whole shore. During the years which followed he was  occupied in various ways, and some of the best recollections of my  boyhood are of the days and the nights which I spent with him on his  fishing-tug, steaming about the Straits of Mackinac and the northern  part of Lake Huron. But he could not forget the Glimmerglass, that  little wild lake up in the woods. He had fallen in love with it at first  sight, and at last he took his family and went there to live._    _Human neighbors were scarce around the lake, and perhaps that was one  reason why we took such a lively interest in the other residents--those  who were there ahead of us. \"Him and me's chums,\" my small sister said  of the red-squirrel that hung around the log-barn. And some of the  animals seemed to take a very lively interest in us. The chipmunks came  into the house occasionally, on foraging expeditions; and so, I regret  to say, did the skunks. There was a woodchuck who used to come to the  back door, looking for scraps, and who learned to sit bolt upright and  hold a pancake in his fore paws while he nibbled at it, without being in  the least disturbed by the presence and the comments of half a dozen  spectators. The porcupines became a never-ending nuisance, for they made  almost nightly visits to the woodshed. To kill them was of little use,  for the next night--or perhaps before morning--there were others to take  their places. Once in a while one of them would climb up onto the roof  of the house; and between his teeth and his feet and the rattling of his  quills on the shingles, the racket that he made was out of all  proportion to his size._              It is sweet to lie at evening in your little trundle-bed,            And to listen to a porky gnawing shingles overhead;              Porky, porky, porky, porky;              Gnawing shingles overhead.    _The wolves had been pretty nearly exterminated since my father's first  visit to the lake, and we saw little or nothing of them. The bears  seemed to be more numerous, but they were very shy and retiring. We  found their tracks more often than we came upon the animals themselves.  Some of the cat tribe remained, and occasionally placed themselves in  evidence. My brother came in one day from a long tramp on snow-shoes,  and told how he had met one of them standing guard over the remains of a  deer, and how the lynx had held him up and made him go around. Beavers  were getting scarce, though a few were still left on the more secluded  streams. Deer, on the contrary, were very plentiful. Many a time they  invaded our garden-patch and helped themselves to our fresh vegetables._    _One August afternoon a flock of eight young partridges, of that  spring's hatching, coolly marched out of the woods and into the  clearing, as if they were bent on investigating their new neighbors.  Partridges appear to be subject to occasional fits of stupidity, and to  temporary (or possibly permanent) loss of common-sense; but it may be  that in this case the birds were too young and inexperienced to realize  what they were doing. Or perhaps they knew that it was Sunday, and that  the rules of the household forbade shooting on that day. If so, their  confidence was sadly misplaced. We didn't shoot them, but we did  surround them, and by working carefully and cautiously we \"shooed\" them  into an empty log-house. And the next day we had them for dinner._    _Around the shores of the Glimmerglass a few loons and wild-ducks  usually nested, and in the autumn the large flocks from the Far North  often stopped there for short visits, on their way south for the winter.  They were more sociable than you would suppose--or at least the loons  were--and the same small girl who had made friends with the red-squirrel  learned to talk to the big birds._    _Down in the water the herring and a large species of salmon trout made  their homes, and probably enjoyed themselves till they met with the  gill-net and the trolling-hook. But herring and salmon trout did not  satisfy us; we wanted brook trout, too. And so one day a shipment of  babies arrived from the hatchery at Sault Ste. Marie, and thus we first  became acquainted with the habits of infant fishes, and learned  something of their needs and the methods of their foster-parents._    _One after another our neighbors introduced themselves, each in his own  way. And they were good neighbors, all of them. Even the porcupines and  the skunks were interesting--in their peculiar fashion--and I wish there  were none worse than they in the city's slums._    _I have said good-by to the Glimmerglass, and it may be that I shall  never again make my home by its shores. But the life of the woods goes  on, and will still go on as long as man will let it. I suppose that,  even as I write, the bears are \"holeing up\" for the winter, and the deer  are growing anxious because the snow is covering the best of their food,  and they of the cat tribe are getting down to business, and hunting in  deadly earnest. The loons and the ducks have pulled out for the Gulf of  Mexico, and the squirrels are glad that they have such a goodly store of  nuts laid up for the next four months. The beavers have retired to their  lodges--that is, if Charley Roop and his fellows have left any of them  alive. The partridges--well,"]]]
