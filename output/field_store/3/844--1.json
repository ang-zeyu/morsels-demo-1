PREFACE.      This narrative will comprehend not only all the explorations made in  past ages, but also all the new discoveries which have of late years  so greatly interested the scientific world. In order to give to this  work--enlarged perforce by the recent labours of modern  travellers,--all the accuracy possible, I have called in the aid of  a man whom I with justice regard as one of the most competent  geographers of the present day: M. Gabriel Marcel, attached to the  Bibliotheque Nationale.    With the advantage of his acquaintance with several foreign  languages which are unknown to me, we have been able to go to the  fountain-head, and to derive all information from absolutely  original documents. Our readers will, therefore, render to M. Marcel  the credit due to him for his share in a work which will demonstrate  what manner of men the great travellers have been, from the time of  Hanno and Herodotus down to that of Livingstone and Stanley.
