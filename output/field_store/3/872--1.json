KELLEY  who has a liking  for \"time agent\" tales._          _THE DEFIANT AGENTS_          1      No windows broke any of the four plain walls of the office; there was no  focus of outer-world sunlight on the desk there. Yet the five disks set  out on its surface appeared to glow--perhaps the heat of the mischief  they could cause ... had caused ... blazed in them.    But fanciful imaginings did not cushion or veil cold, hard fact. Dr.  Gordon Ashe, one of the four men peering unhappily at the display, shook  his head slightly as if to free his mind of such cobwebs.    His neighbor to the right, Colonel Kelgarries, leaned forward to ask  harshly: \"No chance of a mistake?\"    \"You saw the detector.\" The thin gray string of a man behind the desk  answered with chill precision. \"No, no possible mistake. These five have  definitely been snooped.\"    \"And two choices among them,\" Ashe murmured. That was the important  point now.    \"I thought these were under maximum security,\" Kelgarries challenged the  gray man.    Florian Waldour's remote expression did not change. \"Every possible  precaution was in force. There was a sleeper--a hidden  agent--planted----\"    \"Who?\" Kelgarries demanded.    Ashe glanced around at his three companions--Kelgarries, colonel in  command of one sector of Project Star, Florian Waldour, the security  head on the station, Dr. James Ruthven....    \"Camdon!\" he said, hardly able to believe this answer to which logic had  led him.    Waldour nodded.    For the first time since he had known and worked with Kelgarries Ashe  saw him display open astonishment.    \"Camdon? But he was sent us by--\" The colonel's eyes narrowed. \"He must  have been sent.... There were too many cross checks to fake that!\"    \"Oh, he was sent, all right.\" For the first time there was a note of  emotion in Waldour's voice. \"He was a sleeper, a very deep sleeper. They  must have planted him a full twenty-five or thirty years ago. He's been  just what he claimed to be as long as that.\"    \"Well, he certainly was worth their time and trouble, wasn't he?\" James  Ruthven's voice was a growling rumble. He sucked in thick lips,  continuing to stare at the disks. \"How long ago were these snooped?\"    Ashe's thoughts turned swiftly from the enormity of the betrayal to that  important point. The time element--that was the primary concern now that  the damage was done, and they knew it.    \"That's one thing we don't know.\" Waldour's reply came slowly as if he  hated the admission.    \"We'll be safer, then, if we presume the very earliest period.\"  Ruthven's statement was as ruthless in its implications as the shock  they had had when Waldour announced the disaster.    \"Eighteen months ago?\" Ashe protested.    But Ruthven was nodding. \"Camdon was in on this from the very first.  We've had the tapes in and out for study all that time, and the new  detector against snooping was not put in service until two weeks ago.  This case came up on the first checking round, didn't it?\" he asked  Waldour.    \"First check,\" the security man agreed. \"Camdon left the base six days  ago. But he has been in and out on his liaison duties from the first.\"    \"He had to go through those search points every time,\" Kelgarries  protested. \"Thought nothing could get through those.\" The colonel  brightened. \"Maybe he got his snooper films and then couldn't take them  off base. Have his quarters been turned out?\"    Waldour's lips lifted in a grimace of exasperation. \"Please, Colonel,\"  he said wearily, \"this is not a kindergarten exercise. In confirmation  of his success, listen....\" He touched a button on his desk and out of  the air came the emotionless chant of a newscaster.    \"Fears for the safety of Lassiter Camdon, space expediter for the  Western Conference Space Council, have been confirmed by the discovery  of burned wreckage in the mountains. Mr. Camdon was returning from a  mission to the Star Laboratory when his plane lost contact with Ragnor  Field. Reports of a storm in that vicinity immediately raised concern--\"  Waldour snapped off the voice.    \"True--or a cover for his escape?\" Kelgarries wondered aloud.    \"Could be either. They may have deliberately written him off when they  had all they wanted,\" Waldour acknowledged. \"But to get back to our  troubles--Dr. Ruthven is right to assume the worst. I believe we can  only insure the recovery of our project by thinking that these tapes  were snooped anywhere from eighteen months ago to last week. And we must  work accordingly!\"    There was silence in the room as they all considered that. Ashe slipped  down in his chair, his thoughts enmeshed in memories. First there had  been Operation Retrograde, when specially trained \"time agents\" had  shuttled back and forth in history, striving to locate and track down  the mysterious source of alien knowledge which the eastern Communistic  nations had suddenly begun to use.    Ashe himself and a younger partner, Ross Murdock, had been part of the  final action which had solved the mystery, having traced that source of  knowledge not to an earlier and forgotten Terran civilization but to  wrecked spaceships from an eon-old galactic empire--an empire which had  flourished when glacial ice covered most of Europe and northern America  and Terrans were cave-dwelling primitives. Murdock, trapped by the Reds  in one of those wrecked ships, had inadvertently summoned its original  owners, who had descended to trace--through the Russian time  stations--the looters of their wrecks, destroying the whole Red  time-travel system.    But the aliens had not chanced on the parallel western system. And a  year later that had been put into Project Folsom One. Again Ashe,  Murdock, and a newcomer, the Apache Travis Fox, had gone back into time  to the Arizona of the Folsom hunters, discovering what they wanted--two  ships, one wrecked, the other intact. And when the full efforts of the  project had been centered on bringing the intact ship back into the  present, chance had triggered controls set by the dead alien commander.  A party of four, Ashe, Murdock, Fox, and a technician, had then made an  involuntary voyage into space, touching three worlds on which the  galactic civilization of the far past was now marked only by ruins.    Voyage tape fed into the controls of the ship had taken the men, and,  when rewound, had--by a miracle--returned them to Terra with a cargo of  similar tapes found in a building on a world which might have been the  central capital for a government comprised not of countries or of worlds  but of solar systems. Tapes--each one the key to another planet.    And that ancient galactic knowledge was treasure such as the Terrans had  never dreamed of possessing, though there were the attendant fears that  such discoveries could be weapons in enemy hands. There had been an  enforced sharing with other nations of tapes chosen at random at a great  drawing. And each nation secretly remained convinced that, in spite of  the untold riches it might hold as a result of chance, its rivals had  done better. Right at this moment, Ashe did not in the least doubt,  there were agents of his own party intent on accomplishing at the Red  project just what Camdon had done there. However, that did not help in  solving their present dilemma concerning Operation Cochise, one part of  their project, but perhaps the most important now.    Some of the tapes were duds, either too damaged to be useful, or set for  worlds hostile to Terrans lacking the equipment the earlier  star-traveling race had had at its command. Of the five tapes they now  knew had been snooped, three would be useless to the enemy.    But one of the remaining two.... Ashe frowned. One was the goal toward  which they had been working feverishly for a full twelve months. To  plant a colony across the gulf of space--a successful colony--later to  be used as a steppingstone to other worlds....    \"So we have to move faster.\" Ruthven's comment reached Ashe through his  stream of memories.    \"I thought you required at least three more months to conclude personnel  training,\" Waldour observed.    Ruthven lifted a fat hand, running the nail of a broad thumb back and  forth across his lower lip in a habitual gesture Ashe had learned to  mistrust. As the latter stiffened, bracing for a battle of wills, he saw  Kelgarries come alert too. At least the colonel more often than not was  ready to counter Ruthven's demands.    \"We test and we test,\" said the fat man. \"Always we test. We move like  turtles when it would be better to race like greyhounds. There is such a  thing as overcaution, as I have said from the first. One would  think\"--his accusing glance included Ashe and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25555"],[0,"Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen (#1)"],[1,"TALES    [Illustration]    [Illustration: _From \"The Plentiful Tablecloth,\" p. 351._]          Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen    From the French of Alex.

THE TWO BROTHERS     II. TIME AND THE KINGS OF THE ELEMENTS    III. THE TWELVE MONTHS          [Illustration: The Two Brothers]    Once upon a time there were two brothers whose father had left them  but a small fortune. The eldest grew very rich, but at the same time  cruel and wicked, whereas there was nowhere a more honest or kinder  man than the younger. But he remained poor, and had many children, so  that at times they could scarcely get bread to eat. At last, one day  there was not even this in the house, so he went to his rich brother  and asked him for a loaf of bread. Waste of time! His rich brother  only called him beggar and vagabond, and slammed the door in his face.    The poor fellow, after this brutal reception, did not know which way  to turn. Hungry, scantily clad, shivering with cold, his legs could  scarcely carry him along. He had not the heart to go home, with  nothing for the children, so he went towards the mountain forest. But  all he found there were some wild pears that had fallen to the ground.  He had to content himself with eating these, though they set his teeth  on edge. But what was he to do to warm himself, for the east wind with  its chill blast pierced him through and through. \"Where shall I go?\"  he said; \"what will become of us in the cottage? There is neither food  nor fire, and my brother has driven me from his door.\" It was just  then he remembered having heard that the top of the mountain in front  of him was made of crystal, and had a fire for ever burning upon it.  \"I will try and find it,\" he said, \"and then I may be able to warm  myself a little.\" So he went on climbing higher and higher till he  reached the top, when he was startled to see twelve strange beings  sitting round a huge fire. He stopped for a moment, but then said to  himself, \"What have I to lose? Why should I fear? God is with me.  Courage!\"    So he advanced towards the fire, and bowing respectfully, said: \"Good  people, take pity on my distress. I am very poor, no one cares for me,  I have not even a fire in my cottage; will you let me warm myself at  yours?\" They all looked kindly at him, and one of them said: \"My son,  come sit down with us and warm yourself.\"    [Illustration]    So he sat down, and felt warm directly he was near them. But he dared  not speak while they were silent. What astonished him most was that  they changed seats one after another, and in such a way that each one  passed round the fire and came back to his own place. When he drew  near the fire an old man with long white beard and bald head arose  from the flames and spoke to him thus:    \"Man, waste not thy life here; return to thy cottage, work, and live  honestly. Take as many embers as thou wilt, we have more than we  need.\"    And having said this he disappeared. Then the twelve filled a large  sack with embers, and, putting it on the poor man's shoulders, advised  him to hasten home.    Humbly thanking them, he set off. As he went he wondered why the  embers did not feel hot, and why they should weigh no more than a sack  of paper. He was thankful that he should be able to have a fire, but  imagine his astonishment when on arriving home he found the sack to  contain as many gold pieces as there had been embers; he almost went  out of his mind with joy at the possession of so much money. With all  his heart he thanked those who had been so ready to help him in his  need.    He was now rich, and rejoiced to be able to provide for his family.  Being curious to find out how many gold pieces there were, and not  knowing how to count, he sent his wife to his rich brother for the  loan of a quart measure.    This time the brother was in a better temper, so he lent what was  asked of him, but said mockingly, \"What can such beggars as you have  to measure?\"    The wife replied, \"Our neighbour owes us some wheat; we want to be  sure he returns us the right quantity.\"    The rich brother was puzzled, and suspecting something he, unknown to  his sister-in-law, put some grease inside the measure. The trick  succeeded, for on getting it back he found a piece of gold sticking to  it. Filled with astonishment, he could only suppose his brother had  joined a band of robbers: so he hurried to his brother's cottage, and  threatened to bring him before the Justice of the Peace if he did not  confess where the gold came from. The poor man was troubled, and,  dreading to offend his brother, told the story of his journey to the  Crystal Mountain.    Now the elder brother had plenty of money for himself, yet he was  envious of the brother's good fortune, and became greatly displeased  when he found that his brother won every one's esteem by the good use  he made of his wealth. At last he determined to visit the Crystal  Mountain himself.    \"I may meet with as good luck as my brother,\" said he to himself.    Upon reaching the Crystal Mountain he found the twelve seated round  the fire as before, and thus addressed them:    \"I beg of you, good people, to let me warm myself, for it is bitterly  cold, and I am poor and homeless.\"    But one of them replied, \"My son, the hour of thy birth was  favourable; thou art rich, but a miser; thou art wicked, for thou hast  dared to lie to us. Well dost thou deserve thy punishment.\"    Amazed and terrified he stood silent, not daring to speak. Meanwhile  the twelve changed places one after another,"]]]
