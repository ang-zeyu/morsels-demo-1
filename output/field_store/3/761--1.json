This Discourse some years after falling into the hands  of some Learned men, had the good luck to be so favourably receiv'd,  and advantageously spoken of by them, that having had more then  ordinary Invitations given me to make it publick, I thought fit to  review it, that I might retrench some things that seem'd not so fit to  be shewn to every Reader, And substitute some of those other things  that occurr'd to me of the trials and observations I had since made.  What became of my papers, I elsewhere mention in a Preface where I  complain of it: But since I writ That, I found many sheets that  belong'd to the subjects I am now about to discourse of. Wherefore  seeing that I had then in my hands as much of the first Dialogue as  was requisite to state the Case, and serve for an Introduction as well  to the conference betwixt_ Carneades _and_ Eleutherius, _as to some  other Dialogues, which for certain reasons are not now herewith  publish'd, I resolv'd to supply, as well as I could, the Contents of a  Paper belonging to the second of the following Discourses, which I  could not possibly retrive, though it were the chief of them all. And  having once more try'd the Opinion of Friends, but not of the same,  about this imperfect work, I found it such, that I was content in  complyance with their Desires; that not only it should be publish'd,  but that it should be publish'd as soon as conveniently might be. I  had indeed all along the Dialogues spoken of my self, as of a third  Person; For, they containing Discourses which were among the first  Treatises that I ventur'd long ago to write of matters Philosophical,  I had reason to desire, with the Painter, to_ latere pone tabulam,  _and hear what men would say of them, before I own'd my self to be  their Author. But besides that now I find, 'tis not unknown to many  who it is that writ them, I am made to believe that 'tis not  inexpedient, they should be known to come from a Person not altogether  a stranger to Chymical Affairs. And I made the lesse scruple to let  them come abroad uncompleated, partly, because my affairs and  Prae-ingagements to publish divers other Treatises allow'd me small  hopes of being able in a great while to compleat these Dialogues. And  partly, because I am not unapt to think, that they may come abroad  seasonably enough, though not for the Authors reputation, yet for  other purposes. For I observe, that of late Chymistry begins, as  indeed it deserves, to be cultivated by Learned Men who before  despis'd it; and to be pretended to by many who never cultivated it,  that they may be thought not to ignore it: Whence it is come to passe,  that divers Chymical Notions about Matters Philosophical are taken for  granted and employ'd, and so adopted by very eminent Writers both  Naturalists and Physitians. Now this I fear may prove somewhat  prejudicial to the Advancement of solid Philosophy: For though I am a  great Lover of Chymical Experiments, and though I have no mean esteem  of divers Chymical Remedies, yet I distinguish these from their  Notions about the causes of things, and their manner of Generation.  And for ought I can hitherto discern, there are a thousand_ Phaenomena  _in Nature, besides a Multitude of Accidents relating to the humane  Body, which will scarcely be clearly & satisfactorily made out by them  that confine themselves to deduce things from Salt, Sulphur and  Mercury, and the other Notions peculiar to the Chymists, without  taking much more Notice than they are wont to do, of the Motions and  Figures, of the small Parts of Matter, and the other more Catholick  and Fruitful affections of Bodies. Wherefore it will not perhaps be  now unseasonable to let our_ Carneades _warne Men, not to subscribe to  the grand Doctrine of the Chymists touching their three Hypostatical  Principles, till they have a little examin'd it, and consider'd, how  they can clear it from his Objections, divers of which 'tis like they  may never have thought on; since a Chymist scarce would, and none but  a Chymist could propose them. I hope also it will not be unacceptable  to several Ingenious Persons, who are unwilling to determine of any  important Controversie, without a previous consideration of what may  be said on both sides, and yet have greater desires to understand  Chymical Matters, than Opportunities of learning them, to find here  together, besides several Experiments of my own purposely made to  Illustrate the Doctrine of the Elements, divers others scarce to be  met with, otherwise then Scatter'd among many Chymical Books. And to  Find these Associated Experiments so Deliver'd as that an Ordinary  Reader, if he be but Acquainted with the usuall Chymical Termes, may  easily enough Understand Them; and even a wary One may safely rely on  Them. These Things I add, because a Person any Thing vers'd in the  Writings of Chymists cannot but Discern by their obscure, Ambiguous,  and almost AEnigmatical Way of expressing what they pretend to Teach,  that they have no Mind, to be understood at all, but by_ the Sons of  Art _(as they call them) nor to be Understood even by these without  Difficulty And Hazardous Tryalls. Insomuch that some of Them Scarce  ever speak so candidly, as when they make use of that known Chymical  Sentence;_ Ubi palam locuti fumus, ibi nihil diximus. _And as the  obscurity of what some Writers deliver makes it very difficult to be  understood; so the Unfaithfulness of too many others makes it unfit to  be reli'd on. For though unwillingly, Yet I must for the truths sake,  and the Readers, warne him not to be forward to believe Chymical  Experiments when they are set down only by way of Prescriptions, and  not of Relations; that is, unless he that delivers them mentions his  doing it upon his own particular knowledge, or upon the Relation of  some credible person, avowing it upon his own experience. For I am  troubled, I must complain, that even Eminent Writers, both Physitians  and Philosophers, whom I can easily name, if it be requir'd, have of  late suffer'd themselves to be so far impos'd upon, as to Publish and  Build upon Chymical Experiments, which questionless they never try'd;  for if they had, they would, as well as I, have found them not to be  true. And indeed it were to be wish'd, that now that those begin to  quote Chymical Experiments that are not themselves Acquainted with  Chymical Operations, men would Leave off that Indefinite Way of  Vouching the Chymists say this, or the Chymists affirme that, and  would rather for each Experiment they alledge name the Author or  Authors, upon whose credit they relate it; For, by this means they  would secure themselves from the suspition of falshood (to which the  other Practice Exposes them) and they would Leave the Reader to Judge  of what is fit for him to Believe of what is Deliver'd, whilst they  employ not their own great names to Countenance doubtfull Relations;  and they will also do Justice to the Inventors or Publishers of true  Experiments, as well as upon the Obtruders of false ones. Whereas by  that general Way of quoting the Chymists, the candid Writer is  Defrauded of the particular Praise, and the Impostor escapes the  Personal Disgrace that is due to him._    _The remaining Part of this Praeface must be imploy'd in saying  something for_ Carneades, _and something"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net                [Illustration]          The Story of  Young Abraham Lincoln    By    WAYNE WHIPPLE    Author of The Story of the American Flag, The Story of the Liberty Bell,  The Story of the White House, The Story of Young George Washington, the  Story of Young Benjamin Franklin, etc.    Illustrated    PHILADELPHIA    HENRY ALTEMUS COMPANY          COPYRIGHT, 1915, BY HOWARD E.

LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN, PATRIOT                  248          INTRODUCTION    LINCOLN FROM NEW AND UNUSUAL SOURCES      The boy or girl who reads to-day may know more about the real Lincoln  than his own children knew. The greatest President's son, Robert  Lincoln, discussing a certain incident in their life in the White House,  remarked to the writer, with a smile full of meaning:    \"I believe you know more about our family matters than I do!\"    This is because \"all the world loves a lover\"--and Abraham Lincoln loved  everybody. With all his brain and brawn, his real greatness was in his  heart. He has been called \"the Great-Heart of the White House,\" and  there is little doubt that more people have heard about him than there  are who have read of the original \"Great-Heart\" in \"The Pilgrim's  Progress.\"    Indeed, it is safe to say that more millions in the modern world are  acquainted with the story of the rise of Abraham Lincoln from a poorly  built log cabin to the highest place among \"the seats of the mighty,\"  than are familiar with the Bible story of Joseph who arose and stood  next to the throne of the Pharaohs.    Nearly every year, especially since the Lincoln Centennial, 1909,  something new has been added to the universal knowledge of one of the  greatest, if not _the_ greatest man who ever lived his life in the  world. Not only those who \"knew Lincoln,\" but many who only \"saw him  once\" or shook hands with him, have been called upon to tell what they  saw him do or heard him say. So hearty was his kindness toward everybody  that the most casual remark of his seems to be charged with deep human  affection--\"the touch of Nature\" which has made \"the whole world kin\" to  him.    He knew just how to sympathize with every one. The people felt this,  without knowing why, and recognized it in every deed or word or touch,  so that those who have once felt the grasp of his great warm hand seem  to have been drawn into the strong circuit of \"Lincoln fellowship,\" and  were enabled, as if by \"the laying on of hands,\" to speak of him ever  after with a deep and tender feeling.    There are many such people who did not rush into print with their  observations and experiences. Their Lincoln memories seemed too sacred  to scatter far and wide. Some of them have yielded, with real  reluctance, in relating all for publication in THE STORY OF YOUNG  ABRAHAM LINCOLN only because they wished their recollections to benefit  the rising generation.    Several of these modest folk have shed true light on important phases  and events in Lincoln's life history. For instance, there has been much  discussion concerning Lincoln's Gettysburg Address--where was it  written, and did he deliver it from notes?    Now, fifty years after that great occasion, comes a distinguished  college professor who unconsciously settles the whole dispute, whether  Lincoln held his notes in his right hand or his left--if he used them at  all!--while making his immortal \"little speech.\" To a group of veterans  of the Grand Army of the Republic he related, casually, what he saw  while a college student at Gettysburg, after working his way through the  crowd of fifteen thousand people to the front of the platform on that  memorable day. From this point of vantage he saw and heard everything,  and there is no gainsaying the vivid memories of his first  impressions--how the President held the little pages in both hands  straight down before him, swinging his tall form to right, to left and  to the front again as he emphasized the now familiar closing words,  \"_of_ the people--_by_ the people--_for_ the people--shall not perish  from the earth.\"    Such data have been gathered from various sources and are here given for  the first time in a connected life-story. Several corrections of stories  giving rise to popular misconceptions have been supplied by Robert,  Lincoln's only living son. One of these is the true version of \"Bob's\"  losing the only copy of his father's first inaugural address. Others  were furnished by two aged Illinois friends who were acquainted with  \"Abe\" before he became famous. One of these explained, without knowing  it, a question which has puzzled several biographers--how a young man of  Lincoln's shrewd intelligence could have been guilty of such a  misdemeanor, as captain in the Black Hawk War, as to make it necessary  for his superior officer to deprive him of his sword for a single day.    A new story is told by a dear old lady, who did not wish her name  given, about herself when she was a little girl, when a \"drove of  lawyers riding the old Eighth Judicial District of Illinois,\" came to  drink from a famous cold spring on her father's premises. She described  the uncouth dress of a tall young man, asking her father who he was, and  he replied with a laugh, \"Oh, that's Abe Lincoln.\"    One day in their rounds, as the lawyers came through the front gate, a  certain judge, whose name the narrator refused to divulge, knocked down  with his cane her pet doll, which was leaning against the fence. The  little girl cried over this contemptuous treatment of her \"child.\"    Young Lawyer Lincoln, seeing it all, sprang in and quickly picked up the  fallen doll. Brushing off the dust with his great awkward hand he said,  soothingly, to the wounded little mother-heart:    \"There now, little Black Eyes, don't cry. Your baby's alive. See, she  isn't hurt a bit!\"    That tall young man never looked uncouth to her after that. It was this  same old lady who told the writer that Lawyer Lincoln wore a new suit of  clothes for the first time on the very day that he performed the  oft-described feat of rescuing a helpless hog from a great deep hole in  the road, and plastered his new clothes with mud to the great merriment  of his legal friends. This well-known incident occurred not far from her  father's place near Paris, Illinois.    These and many other new and corrected incidents are now collected for  THE STORY OF YOUNG ABRAHAM LINCOLN, in addition to the best of  everything suitable that was known before--as the highest patriotic  service which the writer can render to the young people of the United  States of America.                                                           WAYNE WHIPPLE.          THE STORY OF  YOUNG ABRAHAM LINCOLN          CHAPTER I    ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S FOREFATHERS      Lincoln's grandfather, for whom he was named Abraham, was a distant  cousin to Daniel Boone. The Boones and the Lincolns had intermarried for  generations. The Lincolns were of good old English stock. When he was  President, Abraham Lincoln, who had never given much attention to the  family pedigree, said that the history of his family was well described  by a single line in Gray's \"Elegy\":    \"The short and simple annals of the poor.\"    Yet Grandfather Abraham was wealthy for his day. He accompanied Boone  from Virginia to Kentucky and lost his life there. He had sacrificed  part of his property to the pioneer spirit within him, and, with the  killing of their father, his family lost the rest. They were \"land  poor\" in the wilderness of the \"Dark-and-Bloody-Ground\"--the meaning of  the Indian name, \"Ken-tuc-kee.\"    Grandfather Lincoln had built a solid log cabin and cleared a field or  two around it, near the Falls of the Ohio, about where Louisville now  stands. But, in the Summer of 1784, the tragic day dawned upon the  Lincolns which has come to many a pioneer family in Kentucky and  elsewhere. His son Thomas told this story to his children:      HOW INDIANS KILLED \"GRANDFATHER LINCOLN\"    \"My father--your grandfather, Abraham Lincoln--come over the mountains  from Virginia with his cousin, Dan'l Boone. He was rich for them times,  as he had property worth seventeen thousand dollars; but Mr. Boone he  told Father he could make a good deal more by trappin' and tradin' with  the Injuns for valuable pelts, or fur skins.    \"You know, Dan'l Boone he had lived among the Injuns. He was a sure shot  with the"]]]
