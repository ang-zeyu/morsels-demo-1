Then I folded it up, put it  in my pocket, and pressed the little button on my desk. My mind was  made up.    \"Miss Fentress, I'm leaving this afternoon on an extended trip. The  Florida address will reach me after Thursday. Tell Wade and Bennett to  carry on. I think you have everything in hand? Is everything clear to  you?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Taylor.\" Miss Fentress was not in the least surprised. She  was used to my sudden trips. The outfit got along perfectly without  me; sometimes I think my frequent absences are good for the business.  The boys work like the devil to make a fine showing while I'm away.  And Miss Fentress is a perfect gem of a secretary. I had nothing to  worry about there.    \"Fine! Will you get my diggings on the phone?\" I hurriedly put my few  papers in place, and signed a couple of letters. Then Josef was on the  wire.    \"Josef? Pack my bags right away, will you? For Florida. The usual  things.... Yes, right away. I'll be leaving by noon.... Yes, driving  through.\"           *       *       *       *       *    That was that. There were a few more letters to sign, a few hasty  instructions to be given regarding one or two matters that were  hanging fire. Then, on my way to my bachelor apartments, I read the  telegram through again:         THINK IT WORTH WHILE IF YOU FEEL ADVENTUROUS AND HAVE       NOTHING PRESSING TO COME TO THE MONSTROSITY STOP MAKE YOUR       WILL FIRST STOP SHALL LOOK FOR YOU ANY DAY AS I KNOW YOU ARE       ALWAYS LOOKING FOR EXCITEMENT AND NEVER HAVE ANYTHING       IMPORTANT TO DO SO DON'T BOTHER TO WIRE STOP PERHAPS WE       SHALL SEE HER AGAIN                                                           MERCER    I smiled at Mercer's frank opinion of my disposition and my importance  to my business. But I frowned over the admonition to make my will, and  the last telling statement in the wire: \"Perhaps we shall see her  again.\" I knew whom he meant by \"her.\"    Josef had my bags waiting for me. A few hurried instructions, most of  them shouted over my shoulder, and I was purring down the main drag,  my duffel in the rumble, and the roadster headed due south.    \"Perhaps we shall see her again.\" Those words from the telegram kept  coming before my eyes. Mercer knew what he was about, if he wanted my  company, when he put that line in his wire.           *       *       *       *       *    I have already told the story of our first meeting with the strange  being from the ocean's depths that, wounded and senseless, had been  flung up on the beach near Warren Mercer's Florida estate. In all the  history of civilization, no stranger bit of flotsam had ever been cast  up by a storm.    Neither of us would ever forget that slim white creature, swathed in  her veil of long, light golden hair, as she crouched on the bottom of  Mercer's swimming pool, and pictured for us, by means of Mercer's  thought-telegraph (my own name for the device; he has a long and  scientific title for it with as many joints as a centipede), the story  of her people.    They had lived in a country of steaming mist, when the world was very  young. They had been forced into the sea to obtain food, and after  many generations they had gone back to the sea as man once emerged  from it. They had grown webs on their hands and feet, and they  breathed oxygen dissolved in water, as fishes do, instead of taking it  from the atmosphere. And under the mighty Atlantic, somewhere, were  their villages.    The girl had pictured all these things for us, and then--nearly a year  ago, now--she had pleaded with us to let her return to her people. And  so we had put her back into the sea, and she had bade us farewell. But  just before she disappeared, she had done a strange thing.           *       *       *       *       *    She had pointed, under the water, out towards the depth, and then,  with a broad, sweeping motion of her arm, she had indicated the shore,  as though to promise, it seemed to me, that she intended to return.    And now, Mercer said, we might see her again! How? Mercer,  conservative and scientific, was not the man to make rash promises.  But how...?    The best way to solve the riddle was to reach Mercer, and I broke the  speed laws of five states three days running.    I did not even stop at my own little shack. It was only four miles  from there to the huge, rather neglected estate, built in boom times  by some newly-rich promoter, and dubbed by Mercer \"The Monstrosity.\"    Hardly bothering to slow down, I turned off the concrete onto the  long, weed-grown gravel drive, and shot between the two massive,  stuccoed pillars that guarded the drive. Their corroded bronze plates,  bearing the original title of the estate, \"The Billows,\" were a  promise that my long, hard drive was nearly at an end.           *       *       *       *       *    As soon as the huge, rambling structure was fairly in sight, I pressed  the flat of my hand on the horn button. By the time I came to a  locked-wheel halt, with the gravel rattling on my fenders, Mercer was  there to greet me.    \"It's ten o'clock,\" he grinned as he shook hands. \"I'd set noon as the  hour of your arrival. You certainly must have made time, Taylor!\"    \"I did!\" I nodded rather grimly, recalling one or two narrow squeaks.  \"But who wouldn't, with a wire like this?\" I produced the crumpled  telegram rather dramatically. \"You've got a lot to explain.\"    \"I know it.\" Mercer was quite serious now. \"Come on in and we'll mix  highballs with the story.\"    Locked arm in arm, we entered the house together, and settled  ourselves in the huge living room.    Mercer, I could see at a glance, was thinner and browner than when we  had parted, but otherwise, he was the same lithe, soft-mannered little  scientist I had known for years; dark-eyed, with an almost beautiful  mouth, outlined by a slim, closely cropped and very black moustache.    \"Well, here's to our lady from the sea,\" proposed Mercer, when Carson,  his man, had brought the drinks and departed. I nodded, and we both  sipped our highballs.    \"Briefly,\" said my friend, \"this is the story. You and I know that  somewhere beneath the Atlantic there are a people who went back to  whence they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#1)"],[1,"CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE SERIES._    EDITED BY HAVELOCK ELLIS.

Exterior forms have certainly changed, and the naturalist of yesterday  makes upon us the impression of a legendary being. I refer to the  person described in George Sand's romances, marching vigorously over  hills and valleys in search of a rare insect, which he pricked with  delight, or of a plant difficult to reach, which he triumphantly dried  and fixed on a leaf of paper bearing the date of the discovery and the  name of the locality. A herbarium became a sort of journal, recalling  to its fortunate possessor all the wanderings of the happy chase, all  the delightful sounds and sights of the country. Every naturalist  concealed within him a lover of idylls or eclogues. Assuredly all the  preliminary studies which resulted from these excursions were  necessary; we owe gratitude to our predecessors, and we profit from  their labours, sometimes regretting the loss of the picturesque  fashion in which their researches were carried out.    The naturalist of to-day usually lives more in the laboratory than in  the country. Occasional expeditions to the coast or dredgings are the  only links that attach him to nature; the scalpel and the microtome  have replaced the collector's pins, and the magnifying glass gives  place to the microscope. When the observer begins to pursue his  studies in the laboratory he no longer cares to pass the threshold. He  has still so much to learn concerning the most common creatures that  it seems useless to him to waste his time in seeking those that are  rarer, unless he takes into account the unquestionable pleasure of  rambling through woods or along coasts;--but such a consideration does  not belong to the scientific domain.    A change of conditions of this nature does not suffice to create a  science. To take away from a study all that rendered it pleasant and  easy, and to make it the property of a small coterie, when it was  formerly accessible to all, is not sufficient to render it scientific.  It is a fatality rather than a triumph to have undergone such a  change. The change is an effect rather than a cause.    When little or nothing was known it was necessary to begin by  examining the phenomena which first met the eyes of the observer, such  as the customs of animals and the characters which distinguished them  from each other. Their differences and resemblances were studied; they  were formed into groups, classed and arranged in an order recalling as  much as possible their natural relations. In classifying it is  impossible to consider all the facts or the result would be chaos; it  is necessary to choose the characters and to give preponderance to  certain of them. This sorting of characters has been executed with the  sagacity of genius by the illustrious naturalists of the last century  and the beginning of the present. But the frames which they have  traced are fixed and rigid; nature with her infinite plasticity  escapes from them. We render a great homage to the classifiers when we  say that they have confined the facts as closely as it is possible to  do. The catalogues which they have prepared are of a utility which is  unquestionable, although their _role_ is to be useful only; we cannot  pretend to make them the expression, the symbol, the formula in which  all natural phenomena are to be enclosed. To confound classification  with science is to confound the lever with the effect which we expect  from it.    Curiosity, moreover, always impels towards that which is least known.  External appearances having been studied, the form and function of  internal organs were investigated. Physiology and comparative anatomy  were born and developed; researches abounded and observers abandoned  the field for the laboratory.    The difference in methods of research and the pushing of precision to  its extreme limits--an inevitable result of the different nature of  the observations to be made--did not however yet render legitimate the  claim for natural studies to be called \"science.\"    _Natural history and the natural sciences._--A more important event  has taken place. The ancient naturalists, like their contemporaries,  had firm beliefs which they used as unquestionable principles for the  comprehension of all facts. The explanation of an observation was  ready in advance. The study of facts invariably brought to the pen of  the writer the same enthusiastic admiration of the marvellous part  played by Providence in nature.[1] The phenomena in which this action  was not strikingly apparent were merely described without any attempt  to relate them with each other, or with the other facts. A hypothesis  which left a great number of facts without explanation was necessarily  insufficient. The descriptions, in spite of all their individual  interest, did not constitute a homogeneous whole, a science. They were  merely a collection of more or less natural histories.        [1] See, for example, Reaumur, _Memoires pour l'histoire          des Insectes_, t. i., pp. 23-25.      Science only begins on the day when we have found the simple theory  which binds together all the facts at that time known, without of  course prejudicing the future. As the number"]]]
