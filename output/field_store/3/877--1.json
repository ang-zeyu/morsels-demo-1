PREFACE      As this little book goes to press, Massachusetts, by an act of its  legislature, is made the fourteenth state in this country that requires  the pupils in the primary, as well as in the higher grades of public  schools, to be taught the effects of alcoholics and other narcotics upon  the human system, in connection with other facts of physiology and  hygiene.    The object of all this legislation is, not that the future citizen may  know the technical names of bones, nerves, and muscles, but that he may  have a _=timely=_ and _=forewarning=_ knowledge of the effects of  alcohol and other popular poisons upon the human body, and therefore  upon life and character.    With every reason in favor of such education, and the law requiring it,  its practical tests in the school-room will result in failure, unless  there shall be ready for teacher and scholar, a well-arranged, simple,  and practical book, bringing these truths down to the capacity of the  child.    A few years hence, when the results of this study in our Normal Schools  shall be realized in the preparation of the teacher, we can depend upon  her adapting oral lessons from advanced works on this theme, but now,  the average primary teacher brings to this study no experience, and  limited previous study.    To meet this need, this work has been prepared. Technical terms have  been avoided, and only such facts of physiology developed as are  necessary to the treatment of the effects of alcohol, tobacco, opium,  and other truths of hygiene.    To the children in the Primary Schools of this country, for whom it was  prepared, this work is dedicated.

JOINTS AND BONES.      [Illustration: L]ITTLE girls like a jointed doll to play with, because  they can bend such a doll in eight or ten places, make it stand or sit,  or can even play that it is walking.    [Illustration: _Jointed dolls._]    As you study your own bodies to-day, you will find that you each have  better joints than any dolls that can be bought at a toy shop.      HINGE-JOINTS.    Some of your joints work like the hinges of a door, and these are called  hinge-joints.    You can find them in your elbows, knees, fingers, and toes.    How many hinge-joints can you find?    Think how many hinges must be used by the boy who takes off his hat and  makes a polite bow to his teacher, when she meets him on the street.    How many hinges do you use in running up-stairs, opening the door,  buttoning your coat or your boots, playing ball or digging in your  garden?    You see that we use these hinges nearly all the time. We could not do  without them.      BALL AND SOCKET JOINTS.    All our joints are not hinge-joints.    Your shoulder has a joint that lets your arm swing round and round, as  well as move up and down.    Your hip has another that lets your leg move in much the same way.    [Illustration: _The hip-joint._]    This kind of joint is the round end or ball of a long bone, which moves  in a hole, called a socket.    Your joints do not creak or get out of order, as those of doors and  gates sometimes do. A soft, smooth fluid, much like the white of an egg,  keeps them moist and makes them work easily.      BONES.    What parts of our bodies are jointed together so nicely? Our bones.    How many bones have we?    If you should count all your bones, you would find that each of you has  about two hundred.    Some are large; and some, very small.    There are long-hones in your legs and arms, and many short ones in your  fingers and toes. The backbone is called the spine.    [Illustration: _Backbone of a fish._]    If you look at the backbone of a fish, you can see that it is made up-of  many little bones. Your own spine is formed in much the same way, of  twenty-four small bones. An elastic cushion of gristle (gr[)i]s'l) fits  nicely in between each little bone and the next.    When you bend, these cushions are pressed together on one side and  stretched on the other. They settle back into their first shape, as  soon as you stand straight again.    If you ever rode in a wheelbarrow, or a cart without springs, you know  what a jolting it gave you. These little spring cushions keep you from  being shaken even more severely every time you move.    Twenty-four ribs, twelve on each side, curve around from the spine to  the front, or breast, bone. (_See page 38._)    They are so covered with flesh that perhaps you can not feel and count  them; but they are there.    Then you have two flat shoulder-blades, and two collar-bones that almost  meet in front, just where your collar fastens.    Of what are the bones made?    Take two little bones, such as those from the legs or wings of a  chicken, put one of them into the fire, when it is not very hot, and  leave it there two or three hours. Soak the other bone in some weak  muriatic (m[=u] r[)i] [)a]t'[)i]k) acid. This acid can be bought of any  druggist.    You will have to be careful in taking the bone out of the fire, for it  is all ready to break. If you strike it a quick blow, it will crumble to  dust. This dust we call lime, and it is very much like the lime from  which the mason makes mortar.    [Illustration: _Bone tied to a knot._]    The acid has taken the lime from the other bone, so only the part which  is not lime is left. You will be surprised to see how easily it will  bend. You can twist it and tie it into a knot; but it will not easily  break.    You have seen gristle in meat. This soft part of the bone is gristle.    Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people; so  children's bones bend easily.    I know a lady who has one leg shorter than the other. This makes her  lame, and she has to wear a boot with iron supports three or four inches  high, in order to walk at all.    One day she told me how she became lame.    \"I remember,\" she said, \"when I was between three and four years old,  sitting one day in my high chair at the table, and twisting one foot  under the little step of the chair. The next morning I felt lame; but  nobody could tell what was the matter. At last, the doctors found out  that the trouble all came from that twist. It had gone too far to be  cured. Before I had this boot, I could only walk with a crutch.\"      CARE OF THE SPINE.    Because the spine is made of little bones with cushions between them, it  bends easily, and children sometimes bend it more than they ought.    If you lean over your book or your writing or any other work, the  elastic cushions may get so pressed on the inner edge that they do not  easily spring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25718"],[0,"The Watchers of the Trails: A Book of Animal Life (#1)"],[1,"at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images  generously made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

A.            To    My Fellow of the Wild    Ernest Thompson Seton    [Illustration]          Prefatory Note      In the preface to a former volume[1] I have endeavoured to trace the  development of the modern animal story and have indicated what  appeared to me to be its tendency and scope. It seems unnecessary to  add anything here but a few words of more personal application.    [Footnote 1: \"The Kindred of the Wild.\"]    The stories of which this volume is made up are avowedly fiction. They  are, at the same time, true, in that the material of which they are  moulded consists of facts,--facts as precise as painstaking  observation and anxious regard for truth can make them. Certain of the  stories, of course, are true literally. Literal truth may be attained  by stories which treat of a single incident, or of action so  restricted as to lie within the scope of a single observation. When,  on the other hand, a story follows the career of a wild creature of  the wood or air or water through wide intervals of time and space, it  is obvious that the truth of that story must be of a different kind.  The complete picture which such a story presents is built up from  observation necessarily detached and scattered; so that the utmost it  can achieve as a whole is consistency with truth. If a writer has, by  temperament, any sympathetic understanding of the wild kindreds; if  he has any intimate knowledge of their habits, with any sensitiveness  to the infinite variation of their personalities; and if he has  chanced to live much among them during the impressionable periods  of his life, and so become saturated in their atmosphere and their  environment;--then he may hope to make his most elaborate piece of  animal biography not less true to nature than his transcript of an  isolated fact. The present writer, having spent most of his boyhood on  the fringes of the forest, with few interests save those which the  forest afforded, may claim to have had the intimacies of the  wilderness as it were thrust upon him. The earliest enthusiasms which  he can recollect are connected with some of the furred or feathered  kindred; and the first thrills strong enough to leave a lasting mark  on his memory are those with which he used to follow--furtive,  apprehensive, expectant, breathlessly watchful--the lure of an unknown  trail.    There is one more point which may seem to claim a word. A very  distinguished author--to whom all contemporary writers on nature are  indebted, and from whom it is only with the utmost diffidence that I  venture to dissent at all--has gently called me to account on the  charge of ascribing to my animals human motives and the mental  processes of man. The fact is, however, that this fault is one which I  have been at particular pains to guard against. The psychological  processes of the animals are so simple, so obvious, in comparison with  those of man, their actions flow so directly from their springs of  impulse, that it is, as a rule, an easy matter to infer the motives  which are at any one moment impelling them. In my desire to avoid  alike the melodramatic, the visionary, and the sentimental, I have  studied to keep well within the limits of safe inference. Where I may  have seemed to state too confidently the motives underlying the  special action of this or that animal, it will usually be found that  the action itself is very fully presented; and it will, I think, be  further found that the motive which I have here assumed affords the  most reasonable, if not the only reasonable, explanation of that  action.

A few  paces below him, half-hidden by a gray stump, a green juniper bush,  and a mossy brown hillock, lay a white ewe with a lamb at her side.  The ewe's jaws moved leisurely, as she chewed her cud and gazed up  with comfortable confidence at the sturdy figure of the ram  silhouetted against the brightening sky.    This sunrise was the breaking of the black-faced ram's first day in  the wilderness. Never before had he stood on an open hilltop and  watched the light spread magically over a wide, wild landscape. Up to  the morning of the previous day, his three years of life had been  passed in protected, green-hedged valley pastures, amid tilled fields  and well-stocked barns, beside a lilied water. This rugged, lonely,  wide-visioned world into which fortune had so unexpectedly projected  him filled him with wonder. Yet he felt strangely at ease therein. The  hedged pastures had never quite suited him; but here, at length, in  the great spaces, he felt at home. The fact was that, alike in  character and in outward appearance, he was a reversion to far-off  ancestors. He was the product of a freak of heredity.    In the fat-soiled valley-lands, some fifteen miles back of Ringwaak  Hill, the farmers had a heavy, long-wooled, hornless strain of sheep,  mainly of the Leicester breed, which had been crossed, years back, by  an imported Scotch ram of one of the horned, courageous, upland,  black-faced varieties. The effect of this hardy cross had apparently  all been bred out, save for an added stamina in the resulting stock,  which was uniformly white and hornless. When, therefore, a lamb was  born with a black face and blackish-gray legs, it was cherished as a  curiosity; and when, in time, it developed a splendid pair of horns,  it became the handsomest ram in all the valley, and a source of great  pride to its owner. But when black-faced lambs began to grow common in  the hornless and immaculate flocks, the feelings of the valley folks  changed, and word went around that the strain of the white-faced must  be kept pure. Then it was decreed that the great horned ram should no  longer sire the flocks, but be hurried to the doom of his kind and go  to the shambles.    Just at this time, however, a young farmer from the backwoods  settlement over behind Ringwaak chanced to visit the valley. The sheep  of his settlement were not only hornless, but small and light-wooled  as well, and the splendid, horned ram took his fancy. Here was a  chance to improve his breed. He bought the ram for what he was worth  to the butcher, and proudly led him away, over the hills and through  the great woods, toward the settlement on the other side of Ringwaak.    The backwoodsman knew right well that a flock of sheep may be driven,  but that a single sheep must be led; so he held his new possession  securely by a piece of stout rope about ten feet long. For an hour or  two the ram followed with an exemplary docility quite foreign to his  independent spirit. He was subdued by the novelty of his  surroundings,--the hillocky, sloping pastures, and the shadowy  solemnity of the forest. Moreover, he perceived, in his dim way, a  kind of mastery in this heavy-booted, homespun-clad, tobacco-chewing,  grave-eyed man from the backwoods, and for a long time he felt none of  his usual pugnacity.
