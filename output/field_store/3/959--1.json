I beg to thank the following gentlemen and firms for the help they have  given me in connection with the letterpress and illustrations of \"How It  Works\"--    Messrs. F.J.C. Pole and M.G.

[Illustration: ON THE FOOTPLATE OF A LOCOMOTIVE.]      How It Works      Dealing in Simple Language with Steam, Electricity,    Light, Heat, Sound, Hydraulics, Optics, etc.    and with their applications to Apparatus    in Common Use      By    ARCHIBALD WILLIAMS      Author of \"The Romance of Modern Invention,\"    \"The Romance of Mining,\" etc., etc.      THOMAS NELSON AND SONS      London, Edinburgh, Dublin, and New York          PREFACE.      How does it work? This question has been put to me so often by persons  young and old that I have at last decided to answer it in such a manner  that a much larger public than that with which I have personal  acquaintance may be able to satisfy themselves as to the principles  underlying many of the mechanisms met with in everyday life.    In order to include steam, electricity, optics, hydraulics, thermics,  light, and a variety of detached mechanisms which cannot be classified  under any one of these heads, within the compass of about 450 pages, I  have to be content with a comparatively brief treatment of each subject.  This brevity has in turn compelled me to deal with principles rather  than with detailed descriptions of individual devices--though in several  cases recognized types are examined. The reader will look in vain for  accounts of the Yerkes telescope, of the latest thing in motor cars, and  of the largest locomotive. But he will be put in the way of  understanding the essential nature of _all_ telescopes, motors, and  steam-engines so far as they are at present developed, which I think may  be of greater ultimate profit to the uninitiated.    While careful to avoid puzzling the reader by the use of mysterious  phraseology I consider that the parts of a machine should be given their  technical names wherever possible. To prevent misconception, many of  the diagrams accompanying the letterpress have words as well as letters  written on them. This course also obviates the wearisome reference from  text to diagram necessitated by the use of solitary letters or figures.    I may add, with regard to the diagrams of this book, that they are  purposely somewhat unconventional, not being drawn to scale nor  conforming to the canons of professional draughtsmanship. Where  advisable, a part of a machine has been exaggerated to show its details.  As a rule solid black has been preferred to fine shading in sectional  drawings, and all unnecessary lines are omitted. I would here  acknowledge my indebtedness to my draughtsman, Mr. Frank Hodgson, for  his care and industry in preparing the two hundred or more diagrams for  which he was responsible.    Four organs of the body--the eye, the ear, the larynx, and the  heart--are noticed in appropriate places. The eye is compared with the  camera, the larynx with a reed pipe, the heart with a pump, while the  ear fitly opens the chapter on acoustics. The reader who is unacquainted  with physiology will thus be enabled to appreciate the better these  marvellous devices, far more marvellous, by reason of their absolutely  automatic action, than any creation of human hands.

DICK       _The slovenly wub might well have said: Many men     talk like philosophers and live like fools._      They had almost finished with the loading. Outside stood the Optus, his  arms folded, his face sunk in gloom. Captain Franco walked leisurely  down the gangplank, grinning.    \"What's the matter?\" he said. \"You're getting paid for all this.\"    The Optus said nothing. He turned away, collecting his robes. The  Captain put his boot on the hem of the robe.    \"Just a minute. Don't go off. I'm not finished.\"    \"Oh?\" The Optus turned with dignity. \"I am going back to the village.\"  He looked toward the animals and birds being driven up the gangplank  into the spaceship. \"I must organize new hunts.\"    Franco lit a cigarette. \"Why not? You people can go out into the veldt  and track it all down again. But when we run out halfway between Mars  and Earth--\"    The Optus went off, wordless. Franco joined the first mate at the bottom  of the gangplank.    \"How's it coming?\" he said. He looked at his watch. \"We got a good  bargain here.\"    The mate glanced at him sourly. \"How do you explain that?\"    \"What's the matter with you? We need it more than they do.\"    \"I'll see you later, Captain.\" The mate threaded his way up the plank,  between the long-legged Martian go-birds, into the ship. Franco watched  him disappear. He was just starting up after him, up the plank toward  the port, when he saw _it_.    \"My God!\" He stood staring, his hands on his hips. Peterson was walking  along the path, his face red, leading _it_ by a string.    \"I'm sorry, Captain,\" he said, tugging at the string. Franco walked  toward him.    \"What is it?\"    The wub stood sagging, its great body settling slowly. It was sitting  down, its eyes half shut. A few flies buzzed about its flank, and it  switched its tail.    _It_ sat. There was silence.    \"It's a wub,\" Peterson said. \"I got it from a native for fifty cents. He  said it was a very unusual animal. Very respected.\"    \"This?\" Franco poked the great sloping side of the wub. \"It's a pig! A  huge dirty pig!\"    \"Yes sir, it's a pig. The natives call it a wub.\"    \"A huge pig. It must weigh four hundred pounds.\" Franco grabbed a tuft  of the rough hair. The wub gasped. Its eyes opened, small and moist.  Then its great mouth twitched.    A tear rolled down the wub's cheek and splashed on the floor.    \"Maybe it's good to eat,\" Peterson said nervously.    \"We'll soon find out,\" Franco said.           *       *       *       *       *    The wub survived the take-off, sound asleep in the hold of the ship.  When they were out in space and everything was running smoothly, Captain  Franco bade his men fetch the wub upstairs so that he might perceive  what manner of beast it was.    The wub grunted and wheezed, squeezing up the passageway.    \"Come on,\" Jones grated, pulling at the rope. The wub twisted, rubbing  its skin off on the smooth chrome walls. It burst into the ante-room,  tumbling down in a heap. The men leaped up.    \"Good Lord,\" French said. \"What is it?\"    \"Peterson says it's a wub,\" Jones said. \"It belongs to him.\" He kicked  at the wub. The wub stood up unsteadily, panting.    \"What's the matter with it?\" French came over. \"Is it going to be sick?\"    They watched. The wub rolled its eyes mournfully. It gazed around at the  men.    \"I think it's thirsty,\" Peterson said. He went to get some water. French  shook his head.    \"No wonder we had so much trouble taking off. I had to reset all my  ballast calculations.\"    Peterson came back with the water. The wub began to lap gratefully,  splashing the men.    Captain Franco appeared at the door.    \"Let's have a look at it.\" He advanced, squinting critically. \"You got  this for fifty cents?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" Peterson said. \"It eats almost anything. I fed it on grain  and it liked that. And then potatoes, and mash, and scraps from the  table, and milk. It seems to enjoy eating. After it eats it lies down  and goes to sleep.\"    \"I see,\" Captain Franco said. \"Now, as to its taste. That's the real  question. I doubt if there's much point in fattening it up any more. It  seems fat enough to me already. Where's the cook? I want him here. I  want to find out--\"    The wub stopped lapping and looked up at the Captain.    \"Really, Captain,\" the wub said. \"I suggest we talk of other matters.\"    The room was silent.    \"What was that?\" Franco said. \"Just now.\"    \"The wub, sir,\" Peterson said. \"It spoke.\"    They all looked at the wub.    \"What did it say? What did it say?\"    \"It suggested we talk about other things.\"    Franco walked toward the wub. He went all around it, examining it from  every side. Then he came back over and stood with the men.    \"I wonder if there's a native inside it,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Maybe  we should open it up and have a look.\"    \"Oh, goodness!\" the wub cried. \"Is that all you people can think of,  killing and cutting?\"    Franco clenched his fists. \"Come out of there! Whoever you are, come  out!\"    Nothing stirred. The men stood together, their faces blank, staring at  the wub. The wub swished its tail. It belched suddenly.    \"I beg your pardon,\" the wub said.    \"I don't think there's anyone in there,\" Jones said in a low voice. They  all looked at each other.    The cook came in.    \"You wanted me, Captain?\" he said. \"What's this thing?\"    \"This is a wub,\" Franco said. \"It's to be eaten. Will you measure it and  figure out--\"    \"I think we should have a talk,\" the wub said. \"I'd like to discuss this  with you, Captain, if I might. I can see that you and I do not agree on  some basic issues.\"    The Captain took a long time to answer. The wub waited good-naturedly,  licking the water from its jowls.    \"Come into my office,\" the Captain said at last. He turned and walked  out of the room. The wub rose and padded after him. The men watched it  go out. They heard it climbing the stairs.    \"I wonder what the outcome will be,\" the cook said. \"Well, I'll be in  the kitchen. Let me know as soon as you hear.\"    \"Sure,\" Jones said. \"Sure.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The wub eased itself down in the corner with a sigh. \"You must forgive  me,\" it said. \"I'm afraid I'm addicted to various forms of relaxation.  When one is as large as I--\"    The Captain nodded impatiently. He sat down at his desk and folded his  hands.    \"All right,\" he said. \"Let's get started. You're a wub? Is that  correct?\"    The wub shrugged. \"I suppose so. That's what they call us, the natives,  I mean. We have our own term.\"    \"And you speak English? You've been in contact with Earthmen before?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then how do you do it?\"    \"Speak English? Am I speaking English? I'm not conscious of speaking  anything in particular. I examined your mind--\"    \"My mind?\"    \"I studied the contents, especially the semantic warehouse, as I refer  to it--\"    \"I see,\" the Captain said. \"Telepathy. Of course.\"    \"We are a very old race,\" the wub said. \"Very old and very ponderous. It  is difficult for us to move around. You can appreciate that anything so  slow and heavy would be at the mercy of more agile forms of life. There  was no use in our relying on physical defenses. How could we win? Too  heavy to run, too soft to fight, too good-natured to hunt for game--\"    \"How do you live?\"    \"Plants. Vegetables. We can eat almost anything. We're very catholic.  Tolerant, eclectic, catholic. We live and let live. That's how we've  gotten along.\"    The wub eyed the Captain.    \"And that's why I so violently objected to this business about having me  boiled. I could see the image in your mind--most of me in the frozen  food locker, some of me in the kettle, a bit for your pet cat--\"    \"So you read minds?\" the Captain said. \"How interesting. Anything else?  I mean, what else can you do along those lines?\"    \"A few odds and ends,\" the wub said absently, staring around the room.  \"A nice apartment you have here, Captain. You keep it quite neat. I  respect life-forms that are tidy. Some Martian birds are quite tidy.  They throw things out of their nests and sweep them--\"    \"Indeed.\" The Captain nodded. \"But to get back to the problem--\"    \"Quite so. You spoke of dining on me. The taste, I am told, is good. A  little fatty, but tender. But how can any lasting contact be established  between your people and mine if you resort to such barbaric attitudes?  Eat me? Rather you should discuss questions with me, philosophy, the  arts--\"    The Captain stood up. \"Philosophy. It might interest you to know that we  will be hard put to find something to eat for the next month. An  unfortunate spoilage--\"    \"I know.\" The wub nodded. \"But wouldn't it be more in accord with your  principles of democracy if we all drew straws, or something along that  line? After all, democracy is to protect the minority from just such  infringements. Now, if each of us casts one vote--\"    The Captain walked to the door.    \"Nuts to you,\" he said. He opened the door. He opened his mouth.    He stood frozen, his mouth wide, his eyes staring, his fingers still on  the knob.    The wub watched him. Presently it padded out of the room, edging past  the Captain. It went down the hall, deep in meditation.           *       *       *       *       *    The room was quiet.    \"So you see,\" the wub said, \"we have a common myth. Your mind contains  many familiar myth symbols. Ishtar, Odysseus--\"    Peterson sat silently, staring at the floor. He shifted in his chair.    \"Go on,\" he said. \"Please go on.\"    \"I find in your Odysseus a figure common to the mythology of most  self-conscious races. As I interpret it, Odysseus wanders as an  individual, aware of himself as such. This is the idea of separation, of  separation from family and country. The process of individuation.\"    \"But Odysseus returns to his home.\" Peterson"]]]
