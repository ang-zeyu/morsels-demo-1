[Illustration: Bruennhilde the Valkyrie]          FOREWORD      In selecting a few of the operas every child should know, the editor's  greatest difficulty is in determining what to leave out. The wish to  include \"L'Africaine,\" \"Othello,\" \"Lucia,\" \"Don Pasquale,\" \"Mignon,\"  \"Nozze di Figaro,\" \"Don Giovanni,\" \"Rienzi,\" \"Tannhaeuser,\" \"Romeo and  Juliet,\" \"Parsifal,\" \"Freischuetz,\" and a hundred others makes one  impatient of limitations.    The operas described here are not all great compositions: Some of them  are hopelessly poor. Those of Balfe and Flotow are included because  they were expressions of popular taste when our grandfathers enjoyed  going to the opera.    The Nibelung Ring is used in preference to several other compositions  of Wagner because the four operas included in it are the fullest both  of musical and story wonders, and are at the same time the least  understood.    \"Aida\" and \"Carmen\" belong here--as do many which are left  out--because of their beauty and musical splendour. Few, instead of  many, operas have been written about in this book, because it seemed  better to give a complete idea of several than a superficial sketch of  many.    The beginnings of opera--music-drama--are unknown; but Sulpitius, an  Italian, declared that opera was heard in Italy as early as 1490. The  Greeks, of course, accompanied their tragedies with music long before  that time, but that would not imply \"opera\" as we understand it.  However, modern opera is doubtless merely the development of that  manner of presenting drama.    After the opera, came the ballet, and that belonged distinctively to  France. Before 1681 there were no women dancers in the ballet--only  males. All ballets of shepherdesses and nymphs and dryads were  represented by men and boys; but at last, the ladies of the court of  France took to the ballet for their own amusement, and thus women  dancers became the fashion.    Even the most heroic or touching stories must lose much of their  dignity when made into opera, since in that case the \"music's the  thing,\" and not the \"play.\" For this reason it has seemed necessary to  tell the stories of such operas as \"Il Trovatore,\" with all their  bombastic trimmings complete, in order to be faithful in showing them  as they really are. On the other hand, it has been necessary to try to  treat \"Pinafore\" in Gilbert's rollicking fashion.    Opera is the most superficial thing in the world, even if it appears  the most beautiful to the senses, if not to the intelligence. We go to  opera not specially to understand the story, but to hear music and to  see beautiful scenic effects. It is necessary, however, to know enough  of the story to appreciate the cause of the movement upon the stage,  and without some acquaintance of it beforehand one gets but a very  imperfect knowledge of an opera story from hearing it once.    A very great deal is said of music-motif and music-illustration, and  it has been demonstrated again and again that this is largely the  effort of the ultra-artistic to discover what is not there. At best,  music is a \"concord of sweet sounds\"--heroic, tender, exciting, etc.;  but the elemental passions and emotions are almost all it can define,  or even suggest. Certain music is called \"characteristic\"--anvil  choruses, for example, where hammers or triangles or tin whistles are  used, but that is not music in its best estate, and musical purpose is  best understood after a composer has labelled it, whether the  ultra-artistic are ready to admit it or not.    The opera is never more enjoyed than by a music lover who is incapable  of criticism from lack of musical knowledge: music being first and  last an emotional art; and as our emotions are refined it requires  compositions of a more and more elevated character to appeal to them.  Thus, we range from the bathos and vulgarity of the music hall to the  glories of grand opera!    The history of opera should be known and composers classified, just as  it is desirable to know and to classify authors, painters, sculptors,  and actors.    Music is first of all something to be felt, and it is one of the arts  which does not always explain itself.    DOLORES BACON.

Again, it is said to have been stolen from a play written by the  Marquis de Saint-Georges, which was named La Bohemienne. However that  may be, it would at first sight hardly seem worth stealing, but it has  nevertheless been popular for many decades. Balfe, the composer, had  no sense of dramatic composition and was not much of a musician, but  he had a talent for writing that which could be sung. It was not  always beautiful, but it was always practicable.    The original title of La Bohemienne has in its meaning nothing to do  with Bohemia, and therefore a literal translation does not seem to  have been especially applicable to the opera as Bunn made it. The  story is placed in Hungary and not in Bohemia, and the hero came from  Warsaw, hence the title is a misnomer all the way around. It was Balfe  who tried to establish English opera in London, and to that purpose he  wrote an opera or two in which his wife sang the principal roles; but  in the midst of that enterprise he received favourable propositions  from Paris, and therefore abandoned the London engagement. When he  went to Paris, The Bohemian Girl was only partly written, and he took  from its score several of its arias for use in a new opera. When he  returned to London he wrote new music for the old opera, and thus The  Bohemian Girl knew many vicissitudes off, as well as on, the stage.    The first city to hear this opera, outside of London, was New York. It  was produced in America at the Park Theatre, November 25, 1844. The  most remarkable thing about that performance was that the part of  Arline was sung in the same cast by two women, Miss Dyott and Mrs.  Seguin: the former singing it in the first act, the latter in the  second and third. When it was produced in London, Piccolomini (a most  famous singer) sang Arline and it was written that \"applause from the  many loud enough to rend the heavens\" followed.    Because of this inconsequent opera, Balfe was given the cross of the  Legion of Honour from Napoleon III., and was made Commander of the  Order of Carlos III. by the regent of Spain. This seems incredible,  for good music was perfectly well known from bad, but the undefined  element of popularity was there, and thus the opera became a living  thing.    A story is told of Balfe while he belonged to the Drury Lane  orchestra. \"Vauxhall Gardens\" were then in vogue, and there was a call  for the Drury Lane musicians to go there to play. The \"Gardens\" were a  long way off, and there was no tram-car or other means of  transportation for their patrons. Those who hadn't a coach had no way  of getting there, and it must have cost Balfe considerable to go and  come each day. He decided to find lodgings near the Gardens to save  himself expense. He looked and looked, on the day he first went out.  Others wanted the same thing, and it was not easy to place himself.  However, by evening, he had decided to take anything he could find; so  he engaged a room at an unpromising looking house. He was kept waiting  by the landlady for a long time in the passageway, but at last he was  escorted up to his room, and, being tired out, he immediately went to  bed and to sleep. In the morning he began to look about, and to his  horror and amazement he found a corpse stowed away in a cupboard. Some  member of his landlady's family who occupied the bed had died. When he  applied for the room, he had been made to wait while the previous  occupant was hastily tucked out of sight. After that, he never hired  lodgings without first looking into the cupboards and under the bed.    Balfe was a good deal of a wag, and his waggishness was not always in  good taste, as shown by an incident at carnival time in Rome. His  resemblance to a"]]]
