On! ever on! in that wild, surging torrent; sowing the wind of anarchy,  of terrorism, of lust of blood and hate, and reaping a hurricane of  destruction and of horror.    On! ever on! France, with Paris and all her children still rushes  blindly, madly on; defies the powerful coalition,--Austria, England,  Spain, Prussia, all joined together to stem the flow of carnage,--defies  the Universe and defies God!    Paris this September 1793!--or shall we call it Vendemiaire, Year I.  of the Republic?--call it what we will! Paris! a city of bloodshed, of  humanity in its lowest, most degraded aspect. France herself a gigantic  self-devouring monster, her fairest cities destroyed, Lyons razed to the  ground, Toulon, Marseilles, masses of blackened ruins, her bravest sons  turned to lustful brutes or to abject cowards seeking safety at the cost  of any humiliation.    That is thy reward, oh mighty, holy Revolution! apotheosis of equality  and fraternity! grand rival of decadent Christianity.    Five weeks now since Marat, the bloodthirsty Friend of the People,  succumbed beneath the sheath-knife of a virgin patriot, a month since  his murderess walked proudly, even enthusiastically, to the guillotine!  There has been no reaction--only a great sigh!... Not of content or  satisfied lust, but a sigh such as the man-eating tiger might heave  after his first taste of long-coveted blood.    A sigh for more!    A king on the scaffold; a queen degraded and abased, awaiting death,  which lingers on the threshold of her infamous prison; eight hundred  scions of ancient houses that have made the history of France; brave  generals, Custine, Blanchelande, Houchard, Beauharnais; worthy patriots,  noble-hearted women, misguided enthusiasts, all by the score and by the  hundred, up the few wooden steps which lead to the guillotine.    An achievement of truth!    And still that sigh for more!    But for the moment,--a few seconds only,--Paris looked round her mighty  self, and thought things over!    The man-eating tiger for the space of a sigh licked his powerful jaws  and pondered!    Something new!--something wonderful!    We have had a new Constitution, a new Justice, new Laws, a new Almanack!    What next?    Why, obviously!--How comes it that great, intellectual, aesthetic Paris  never thought of such a wonderful thing before?    A new religion!    Christianity is old and obsolete, priests are aristocrats, wealthy  oppressors of the People, the Church but another form of wanton tyranny.    Let us by all means have a new religion.    Already something has been done to destroy the old! To destroy! always  to destroy! Churches have been ransacked, altars spoliated, tombs  desecrated, priests and curates murdered; but that is not enough.    There must be a new religion; and to attain that there must be a new  God.    \"Man is a born idol-worshipper.\"    Very well then! let the People have a new religion and a new God.    Stay!--Not a God this time!--for God means Majesty, Power, Kingship!  everything in fact which the mighty hand of the people of France has  struggled and fought to destroy.    Not a God, but a goddess.    A goddess! an idol! a toy! since even the man-eating tiger must play  sometimes.    Paris wanted a new religion, and a new toy, and grave men, ardent  patriots, mad enthusiasts, sat in the Assembly of the Convention and  seriously discussed the means of providing her with both these things  which she asked for.    Chaumette, I think it was, who first solved the difficulty:--Procureur  Chaumette, head of the Paris Municipality, he who had ordered that  the cart which bore the dethroned queen to the squalid prison of the  Conciergerie should be led slowly past her own late palace of the  Tuileries, and should be stopped there just long enough for her to see  and to feel in one grand mental vision all that she had been when she  dwelt there, and all that she now was by the will of the People.    Chaumette, as you see, was refined, artistic;--the torture of the fallen  Queen's heart meant more to him than a blow of the guillotine on her  neck.    No wonder, therefore, that it was Procureur Chaumette who first  discovered exactly what type of new religion Paris wanted just now.    \"Let us have a Goddess of Reason,\" he said, \"typified if you will by  the most beautiful woman in Paris. Let us have a feast of the Goddess of  Reason, let there be a pyre of all the gew-gaws which for centuries  have been flaunted by overbearing priests before the eyes of starving  multitudes, let the People rejoice and dance around that funeral pile,  and above it all let the new Goddess tower smiling and triumphant. The  Goddess of Reason! the only deity our new and regenerate France shall  acknowledge throughout the centuries which are to come!\"    Loud applause greeted the impassioned speech.    \"A new goddess, by all means!\" shouted the grave gentlemen of the  National Assembly, \"the Goddess of Reason!\"    They were all eager that the People should have this toy; something to  play with and to tease, round which to dance the mad Carmagnole and sing  the ever-recurring \"Ca ira.\"    Something to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of  its own deeds, and the helplessness of its legislators.    Procureur Chaumette enlarged upon his original idea; like a true artist  who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the  minute details, he was already busy elaborating his scheme.    \"The goddess must be beautiful... not too young... Reason can only go  hand in hand with the riper age of second youth... she must be decked  out in classical draperies, severe yet suggestive... she must be rouged  and painted... for she is a mere idol... easily to be appeased with  incense, music and laughter.\"    He was getting deeply interested in his subject, seeking minutiae of  detail, with which to render his theme more and more attractive.    But patience was never the characteristic of the Revolutionary  Government of France. The National Assembly soon tired of Chaumette's  dithyrambic utterances. Up aloft on the Mountain, Danton was yawning  like a gigantic leopard.    Soon Henriot was on his feet. He had a far finer scheme than that of  the Procureur to place before his colleagues. A grand National fete,  semi-religious in character, but of the new religion which destroyed and  desecrated and never knelt in worship.    Citizen Chaumette's Goddess of Reason by all means--Henriot conceded  that the idea was a good one--but the goddess merely as a figure-head:  around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests, typifying  the destruction of ancient hierarchy, mules carrying loads of sacred  vessels, the spoils of ten thousand churches of France, and ballet girls  in bacchanalian robes, dancing the Carmagnole around the new deity.    Public Prosecutor Foucquier Tinville thought all these schemes very  tame. Why should the People of France be led to think that the era of  a new religion would mean an era of milk and water, of pageants and of  fireworks? Let every man, woman, and child know that this was an era of  blood and again of blood.    \"Oh!\" he exclaimed in passionate accents, \"would that all the traitors  in France had but one head, that it might be cut off with one blow of  the guillotine!\"    He approved of the National fete, but he desired an apotheosis of the  guillotine; he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on  one grand and glorious day: ten thousand heads to adorn the Place de  la Revolution on a great, never-to-be-forgotten evening, after the  guillotine had accomplished this record work.    But Collot d'Herbois would also have his say. Collot lately hailed from  the South, with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the  whole of this horrible decade. He would not be outdone by Tinville's  bloodthirsty schemes.    He was the inventor of the \"Noyades,\" which had been so successful at  Lyons and Marseilles. \"Why not give the inhabitants of Paris one of  these exhilarating spectacles?\" he asked with a coarse, brutal laugh.    Then he explained his invention, of which he was inordinately proud.  Some two or three hundred traitors, men, women, and children, tied  securely together with ropes in great, human bundles and thrown upon a  barge in the middle of the river: the barge with a hole in her bottom!  not too large! only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly, very slowly,  in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators.    The cries of the women and children, and even of the men, as they felt  the waters rising and gradually enveloping them, as they felt themselves  powerless even for a fruitless struggle, had proved most exhilarating,  so Citizen Collot declared, to the hearts of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27867"],[0,"Scientific American magazine, Vol. 2 Issue 1 (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: Issue Title]          THE NEW YORK  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN          A WEEKLY JOURNAL OF PRACTICAL INFORMATION, ART, SCIENCE,  MECHANICS, CHEMISTRY, AND MANUFACTURES.

BY MARSHALL S. PIKE, OF THE HARMONEONS      DESCRIPTIVE: Opposite Harper's Ferry,--which is situated on a pleasant  elevation at the junction of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers--a few  rods north of \"Pinnacle Bluff,\" a flighty eminence on the Blue Ridge  Mountains, stands a most singular formation of rock, known as  'Washington's Face'; and which, to a casualist void of imaginative  powers, is easily recognized if pointed out by a guide; but to a close  observer, however, with common discernable perception, it presents _at  first sight_ a most striking and correct resemblance of _the great  original_. From midway the bridge which crosses the Potomac, the  countenance and contour of the face _to me_, appeared discriminatingly  perfect, and constrained me to look upon it as _one_ of the most  wonderful, and the noblest work of revealed nature.      In the high barren cliffs of the Blue Mountain Ridge,    That frightfully hang o'er the trestle-built bridge,    Juts out into space a huge rocky bluff,    Which the elements rudely left broken and rough.    Near this, stands a bust so exquisitely fair,    That the chisel of art would be uselessness there!    For nature wrought well till the model was done--    An impress on stone of our GREAT WASHINGTON.      The Earth born from chaos at some mighty shock,    Left the image to rest on the high mountain rock,    On a turret-like peak, in the heavens above,    _As a sentinel over the country we love:_    Where the sunbeam could linger till daylight had fled,    Where the bright stars of night, form a crown o'er its head;    And where, through the greenwood, the faintest breeze creeps,    To sigh for the Hero, who deathlessly sleeps.      There it stands like a giant in storm and in calm,    Like the Hero in battle, no foeman could harm!    And commandingly looks with a Patriot's pride,    On the wild mountain stream of Potomac's fast tide,    Whose waters swell on in the valley between,    Through the vast hilly regions and forests of green;    O'er a rock-bottomed track, to the blue-bosomed sea,    From its struggles to rest, like our sire of the free.      Stand up there in might, till the bright sun shall die,    Till the stars glimmer out their light in the sky,    And the moon shall no longer lend beauty or light,    But _all_ shall again be dark chaos and night,--    Till then, let its base be the tall craggy steep,    Where rocks are o'er moss-grown, and ivy-vines creep;    With the Heaven's wide canopy over its head,    _An immortal image of greatness that's dead._           *       *       *       *       *          [Illustration: THE VIOL SERAPHINE]      INTRODUCTION.--The clear tones of a viol or bass viol are generally  admitted to be more melodious than those produced by other kinds of  instruments, and many have expressed a desire to see an instrument so  constructed as to be played with keys, like the organ or piano forte,  and give the tones of the violin. This is the character of the  instrument here introduced. It is elegant in appearance; occupies less  than half the space of a piano forte, and is so light and portable  that a lady-performer may readily place it before her, and thus avoid  the necessity,--unpleasant to all parties,--of turning her back on the  company. We do not say that an instrument of this kind has been as yet  constructed complete: but the principle has been proved, and it may,  and probably will be soon, offered to the public, at a cost not  exceeding sixty dollars.    EXPLANATION.--In the engraving, a side view elevation only is  represented, showing only one string and one key of a series of twenty  or more of each. The body of the machine A B, is a light hollow chest  about three feet square and six inches deep, supported by four posts  or legs with castors. Two bridges, C and D, extend across the breadth  of the chest. The bridge D is supported by a cleat, E, in which is  inserted the pin F, to which is attached one end of the string C D F.  The other end of the string is simply attached to the bridge C. A  key-lever, G H, passes through the bridge, and is mounted on a pivot  therein. The front end of the key (G) is held in its ordinary position  by a small spring thereunder, and may be"]]]
