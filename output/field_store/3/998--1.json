[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30044"],[0,"The Carnivore (#1)"],[1,"carnivore     By G. A. MORRIS     Illustrated by BURCHARD       _Why were they apologetic? It   wasn't their fault that they   came to Earth much too late._      The beings stood around my bed in air suits like ski suits, with globes  over their heads like upside-down fishbowls. It was all like a  masquerade, with odd costumes and funny masks.    I know that the masks are their faces, but I argue with them and find I  think as if I am arguing with humans behind the masks. They are people.  I recognize people and whether I am going to like this person or that  person by something in the way they move and how they get excited when  they talk; and I know that I like these people in a motherly sort of  way. You have to feel motherly toward them, I guess.    They all remind me of Ronny, a medical student I knew once. He was small  and round and eager. You had to like him, but you couldn't take him very  seriously. He was a pacifist; he wrote poetry and pulled it out to read  aloud at ill-timed moments; and he stuttered when he talked too fast.    They are like that, all fright and gentleness.           *       *       *       *       *    I am not the only survivor--they have explained that--but I am the first  they found, and the least damaged, the one they have chosen to represent  the human race to them. They stand around my bed and answer questions,  and are nice to me when I argue with them.    All in a group they look half-way between a delegation of nations and an  ark, one of each, big and small, thick and thin, four arms or wings, all  shapes and colors in fur and skin and feathers.    I can picture them in their UN of the Universe, making speeches in their  different languages, listening patiently without understanding each  other's different problems, boring each other and being too polite to  yawn.    They are polite, so polite I almost feel they are afraid of me, and I  want to reassure them.    But I talk as if I were angry. I can't help it, because if things had  only been a little different ... \"Why couldn't you have come sooner? Why  couldn't you have tried to stop it before it happened, or at least come  sooner, afterward...?\"    If they had come sooner to where the workers of the Nevada power pile  starved slowly behind their protecting walls of lead--if they had looked  sooner for survivors of the dust with which the nations of the world had  slain each other--George Craig would be alive. He died before they came.  He was my co-worker, and I loved him.    We had gone down together, passing door by door the automatic safeguards  of the plant, which were supposed to protect the people on the outside  from the radioactive danger from the inside--but the danger of a failure  of politics was far more real than the danger of failure in the science  of the power pile, and that had not been calculated by the builders. We  were far underground when the first radioactivity in the air outside had  shut all the heavy, lead-shielded automatic doors between us and the  outside.    We were safe. And we starved there.    \"Why didn't you come sooner?\" I wonder if they know or guess how I feel.  My questions are not questions, but I have to ask them. He is dead. I  don't mean to reproach them--they look well meaning and kindly--but I  feel as if, somehow, knowing why it happened could make it stop, could  let me turn the clock back and make it happen differently. If I could  have signaled them, so they would have come just a little sooner.    They look at one another, turning their funny-face heads uneasily,  moving back and forth, but no one will answer.    The world is dead.... George is dead, that thin, pathetic creature with  the bones showing through his skin that he was when we sat still at the  last with our hands touching, thinking there were people outside who had  forgotten us, hoping they would remember. We didn't guess that the world  was dead, blanketed in radiating dust outside. Politics had killed it.    These beings around me, they had been watching, seeing what was going to  happen to our world, listening to our radios from their small  settlements on the other planets of the Solar System. They had seen the  doom of war coming. They represented stellar civilizations of great  power and technology, and with populations that would have made ours  seem a small village; they were stronger than we were, and yet they had  done nothing.    \"Why didn't you stop us? You could have stopped us.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A rabbity one who is closer than the others backs away, gesturing  politely that he is giving room for someone else to speak, but he looks  guilty and will not look at me with his big round eyes. I still feel  weak and dizzy. It is hard to think, but I feel as if they are hiding a  secret.    A doelike one hesitates and comes closer to my bed. \"We discussed it ...  we voted....\" It talks through a microphone in its helmet with a soft  lisping accent that I think comes from the shape of its mouth. It has a  muzzle and very soft, dainty, long nibbling lips like a deer that  nibbles on twigs and buds.    \"We were afraid,\" adds one who looks like a bear.    \"To us the future was very terrible,\" says one who looks as if it  might have descended from some sort of large bird like a penguin. \"So  much-- Your weapons were very terrible.\"    Now they all talk at once, crowding about my bed, apologizing. \"So much  killing. It hurt to know about. But your people didn't seem to mind.\"    \"We were afraid.\"    \"And in your fiction,\" the doelike one lisped, \"I saw plays from your  amusement machines which said that the discovery of beings in space  would save you from war, not because you would let us bring friendship  and teach peace, but because the human race would unite in _hatred_ of  the outsiders. They would forget their hatred of each other only in a  new and more terrible war with us.\" Its voice breaks in a squeak and it  turns its face away from me.    \"You were about to come out into space. We were wondering how to hide!\"  That is a quick-talking one, as small as a child. He looks as if he  might have descended from a bat--gray silken fur on his pointed face,  big night-seeing eyes, and big sensitive ears, with a humped shape on  the back of his air suit which might be folded wings. \"We were trying to  conceal where we had built, so that humans would not guess we were near  and look for us.\"    They are ashamed of their fear, for because of it they broke all the  kindly laws of their civilizations, restrained all the pity and  gentleness I see in them, and let us destroy ourselves.    I am beginning to feel more awake and to see more clearly. And I am  beginning to feel sorry for them, for I can see why they are afraid.    They are herbivores. I remember the meaning of shapes. In the paths  of evolution there are grass eaters and berry eaters and root diggers.  Each has its functional shape of face and neck--and its wide,  startled-looking eyes to see and run away from the hunters. In all their  racial history they have never killed to eat. They have been killed and  eaten, or run away, and they evolved to intelligence by selection. Those  lived who succeeded in running away from carnivores like lions, hawks,  and men.           *       *       *       *       *    I look up, and they turn their eyes and heads in quick embarrassed  motion, not meeting my eye. The rabbity one is nearest and I reach out  to touch him, pleased because I am growing strong enough now to move my  arms. He looks at me and I ask the question: \"Are there any  carnivores--flesh eaters--among you?\"    He hesitates, moving his lips as if searching for tactful words. \"We  have never found any that were civilized. We have frequently found them  in caves and tents fighting each other. Sometimes we find them fighting  each other with the ruins of cities around them, but they are always  savages.\"    The bearlike one said heavily, \"It might be that carnivores evolve more  rapidly and tend toward intelligence more often, for we find radioactive  planets without life, and places like the place you call your asteroid  belt, where a planet should be--but there are only scattered fragments  of planet, pieces that look as if a planet had been blown apart. We  think that usually ...\" He looked at me uncertainly, beginning to  fumble his words. \"We think ...\"    [Illustration]    \"Yours is the only carnivorous race we have found that was--civilized,  that had a science and was going to come out into space,\" the doelike  one interrupted softly. \"We were afraid.\"    They seem to be apologizing.    The rabbity one, who seems to be chosen as the leader in speaking to me,  says, \"We will give you anything you want. Anything we are able to give  you.\"    They mean it. We survivors will be privileged people, with a key to all  the cities, everything free. Their sincerity is wonderful, but puzzling.  Are they trying to atone for the thing they feel was a crime; that they  allowed humanity to murder itself, and lost to the Galaxy the richness  of a race? Is this why they are so generous?    Perhaps then they will help the race to get started again. The records  are not lost. The few survivors can eventually repopulate Earth. Under  the tutelage of these peaceable races, without the stress of division  into nations, we will flower as a race. No children of mine to the  furthest descendant will ever make war again. This much of a lesson we  have learned.    These timid beings do not realize how much humanity has wanted peace.  They do not know how reluctantly we were forced and trapped by old  institutions and warped tangles of politics to which we could see no  answer. We are not naturally savage. We are not savage when approached  as individuals. Perhaps they know this, but are afraid anyhow,  instinctive fear rising up from the blood of their hunted, frightened  forebears.           *       *       *       *       * "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30047"],[0,"Aircraft and Submarines (#1)"],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net            [Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected.

ABBOT    Author of \"The Story of Our Army,\" \"The Story of Our Navy,\" \"The  Nations at War\"      _With Eight Color Plates and 100 Other Illustrations_            G. P. Putnam's Sons    New York and London    The Knickerbocker Press    1918      Copyright, 1918    By    WILLIS J. ABBOT      The Knickerbocker Press, New York          PREFACE      Not since gunpowder was first employed in warfare has so  revolutionary a contribution to the science of slaughtering men been  made as by the perfection of aircraft and submarines. The former  have had their first employment in this world-wide war of the  nations. The latter, though in the experimental stage as far back as  the American Revolution, have in this bitter contest been for the  first time brought to so practical a stage of development as to  exert a really appreciable influence on the outcome of the struggle.    Comparatively few people appreciate how the thought of navigating  the air's dizziest heights and the sea's gloomiest depths has  obsessed the minds of inventors. From the earliest days of history  men have grappled with the problem, yet it is only within two  hundred years for aircraft and one hundred for submarines that any  really intelligent start has been made upon its solution. The men  who really gave practical effect to the vague theories which others  set up--in aircraft the Wrights, Santos-Dumont, and Count Zeppelin;  in submarines Lake and Holland--are either still living, or have  died so recently that their memory is still fresh in the minds of  all.    In this book the author has sketched swiftly the slow stages by  which in each of these fields of activity success has been attained.  He has collated from the immense mass of records of the activities  of both submarines and aircraft enough interesting data to show the  degree of perfection and practicability to which both have been  brought. And he has outlined so far as possible from existing  conditions the possibilities of future usefulness in fields other  than those of war of these new devices.    The most serious difficulty encountered in dealing with the present  state and future development of aircraft is the rapidity with which  that development proceeds. Before a Congressional Committee last  January an official testified that grave delay in the manufacture of  airplanes for the army had been caused by the fact that types  adopted a scant three months before had become obsolete, because of  experience on the European battlefields, and later inventions before  the first machines could be completed. There may be exaggeration in  the statement but it is largely true. Neither the machines nor the  tactics employed at the beginning of the war were in use in its  fourth year. The course of this evolution, with its reasons, are  described in this volume.    Opportunities for the peaceful use of airplanes are beginning to  suggest themselves daily. After the main body of this book was in  type the Postmaster-General of the United States called for bids for  an aerial mail service between New York and Washington--an act urged  upon the Government in this volume. That service contemplates a  swift carriage of first-class mail at an enhanced price--the  tentative schedule being three hours, and a postage fee of  twenty-five cents an ounce. There can be no doubt of the success of  the service, its value to the public, and its possibilities of  revenue to the post-office. Once its usefulness is established it  will be extended to routes of similar length, such as New York and  Boston, New York and Buffalo, or New York and Pittsburgh. The mind  suggests no limit to the extension of aerial service, both postal  and passenger, in the years of industrial activity that shall follow  the war.    In the preparation of this book the author has made use of many  records of personal experiences of those who have dared the air's  high altitudes and the sea's stilly depths. For permission to use  certain of these he wishes to express his thanks to the Century Co.,  for extracts from _My Airships_ by Santos-Dumont; to Doubleday, Page  & Co., for extracts from _Flying for France_, by James R. McConnell;  to Charles Scribner's Sons, for material drawn from _With the French  Flying Corps_, by Carroll Dana Winslow; to _Collier's Weekly_, for  certain extracts from interviews with Wilbur Wright; to _McClure's  Magazine_, for the account of Mr. Ray Stannard Baker's trip in a  Lake submarine; to Hearst's International Library, and to the  _Scientific American_, for the use of several illustrations.
