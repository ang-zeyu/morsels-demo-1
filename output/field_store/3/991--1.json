It is the present author's  purpose to set forth herein a series of practical methods suited to the  needs of the sportsman-amateur who desires personally to preserve  trophies and specimens taken on days spent afield with gun or rod.    The lover of field and gun may spend many fascinating hours at his  bench, preparing, setting up, and finishing specimens of his own taking.  Besides, the pursuit of this art will afford an amount of remuneration  to the amateur who takes it up in a commercial way, doing work for  others who have neither the time nor inclination for preparing their  own specimens.    The chief requisites for the beginner in taxidermy are joy in working  out detail and a moderate amount of patience.    As suitable tools are the primary consideration in contemplating any  work in taxidermy, a simple list follows. In this list no heavier work  than the mounting of a Virginia deer head is dealt with. This outfit  will be found practical for general light use:    A pocket-knife, one or two small scalpels, a kitchen paring-knife, an  oil stone and can of oil, a hand drill, a fine fur-comb, one bone  scraper, one small skin-scraper, one pair tinners' shears, one pair five  and one-half inch diagonal wire cutters, one pair (same length) Bernard  combination wire cutter and pliers, one pair small scissors, two or  three assorted flat files, one hollow handle tool holder with tools and  little saw, one good hand-saw, one hack-saw, one upholsterer's  regulator, one pair fine tweezers (such as jewelers use), one claw  hammer, an assortment of round and furriers' needles, one or two darning  needles, a sack needle, and an assortment of artists' small bristle and  sable brushes (both round and flat).    Make your own stuffing rods, out of any size iron wire, by hammering  flat one end of a suitable length, filing teeth into the flat face thus  made, and then bending a loop handle on the other end. This type of rod  is easily curved or straightened to suit every need.    Those not wishing to buy at once the complete outfit named above will  find that they can do good small work to start on with the aid of a  pocket-knife, a pair of scissors, a pair of Bernard combination wire  cutter and pliers, needles and thread, cord, a pair of tweezers, a  hammer and saw, and small drill set.    Suitable materials follow the tools in order.    Arsenic is needed for the preservation of all specimens against moths.  This is most effective when used in solution, which is made as follows:  First dampen the arsenic powder with alcohol to saturate it quickly,  when water is added. Place the arsenic in a large metal pail and to  one-half pound of the powder add two gallons of water. Boil hard and  steady over a good fire until the arsenic is completely dissolved. Place  the solution thus made in an earthenware jar with closed cover, plainly  marked \"Poison,\" and keep out of reach of children. Allow solution to  cool before applying to skins. Do not use the pail that the solution was  made in for anything else.    When using arsenic-water grease your hands with a little tallow, rubbing  well under and around finger-nails and wiping the hands partially dry so  that none of the grease will soil fur or feathers. This precaution will  keep the arsenic from entering your skin.    Wash the hands with soap powder and a nail brush after work.    Apply arsenic-water with a brush, or a cotton-and-wire swab, to all  inner surfaces of specimen skins.    Carbolic acid (best to procure U. S. P. pure crystals if possible) is  needed for use in dilute form for relaxing dried skins. This prevents  decay and does not injure the specimen skin. A few drops of the  dissolved crystal to a quart of water is sufficient. Keep carefully  labeled and in a safe place.    Following is a list of the materials needed for general light work:    A quantity of fine excelsior, fine tow and cotton batting, a quantity of  various sizes of galvanized soft steel wire, an assortment of colored,  enameled artificial eyes (procure a taxidermist's supply-house catalog  and from this order your special tools and sizes and colors of eyes  needed), a jar of liquid cement, dry glue (for melting up for  papier-mache), dry paper pulp, plaster of paris, Venetian turpentine,  boiled linseed oil, boracic acid, some refined beeswax, a little  balsam-fir, white varnish, turpentine, alcohol, benzine and a student's  palette of tube oil colors (such as vermilion, rose madder, burnt  sienna, yellow ochre, cadmium yellow middle, zinc white, cobalt blue,  French ultramarine Blue, and Viridian).    Plastic compositions of papier-mache are essential, especially in mammal  and game-head work, for properly finishing the details of ears, face,  and feet of specimens after the body has been filled. These are applied  partly as a last detail before mounting and partly after the figure is  set up.    Compo. No. I is practical for all-around use. Take one-third hot melted  glue and two-thirds flour paste (thick and thoroughly cooked). To this  add a little boracic acid, a little arsenic powder, a very little of  Venetian turpentine, a quantity of gray building-paper pulp (soak paper  and squeeze and beat up even and then squeeze water out). To furnish a  body to this mass, stir in dry white lead until middling thick. Beat the  whole well together.    When carried so far this compo. is a powerful adhesive medium and may be  employed to stick tanned deer scalps to mannikins, and ear skin of same  to the lead cartilages.    Compo. No. II is No. I with fine plaster of paris added until of the  consistency of modeling clay or a trifle stiffer. This makes it ready  for filling ear butts, eye sockets, noses, and feet for modeling into  permanent shape. Sets by drying.    Compo. No. III is for monkey faces, vulture heads, lizards, turtles,  etc. This composition dries very slowly and must be touched up now and  then while drying, to preserve the details without warping. When dry it  is like stone and holds the skin firmly. Take gray paper-pulp, hot  melted glue (quantity according to amount of compo. needed), a little  boracic acid (to prevent decay of glue), boiled linseed oil (fifty per  cent. less than glue), a little arsenic powder (to prevent dermestes  from eating into work), and to this mass add whiting until desired  stiffness for modeling under skin is obtained. Beat and rub to an even  smoothness and stop adding whiting at point where compo. is thick but  still very sticky. Rub some of the compo. into inner surface of skin to  be finished with it or skin will not take hold of mannikin or compo. to  stay.    After modeling is finished under the skin apply linseed oil on outside  and repeat this application several times during the period of drying.  Watch and remodel details if any distortion attends the drying process.    Fine fleshy wrinkles and skin details can be worked out with this compo.  It will hold a thin raw skin where it is put, but is not practical under  fur or feathers.    Compo. No. IV may be used with wire netting or rough board as a base for  making earth bases, imitation rock stands, etc. Take one-third hot  melted glue, two-thirds flour paste, a quantity of paper pulp, a small  amount of boiled linseed oil, a very little of Venetian turpentine,  boracic acid, and arsenic. Thicken to modeling consistency with plaster  of paris, coloring by adding some dry raw umber or lamp black and burnt  umber.    Surface the bases made of this compo. by pressing sand, gravel, or  forest mold into the face and when dry shake off the loose material.  Touch up with tube colors, as desired, and when this is dry apply a very  thin varnish and turpentine finish to bring out a natural damp look.    A foreword as to care of mountable specimens in the field may save a  great amount of cleaning of mussed skins in the shop.    All shot or bullet holes should be immediately plugged with cotton when  specimens are taken. Take a little cotton along in your hunting coat for  this purpose.    In birds plug also the mouth, nostrils, and vent to prevent escape of  juices into plumage. A small sharpened twig will serve to place the  plugs. Slip the bird head first into a paper cone for carrying.    Mussed or blood-stained specimens should not necessarily be discarded.  Look them over first. Many such specimens may be cleaned very easily and  come out in the finish as nearly perfect as others that appeared much  better at the start.

It is shown as {Rx}  in this version of the etext.    Some letters have a macron (straight line) above them; these are  indicated as {=x}, with x being the particular letter.    The book uses both upper and lower case oe ligatures. These are shown  as {OE} and {oe} respectively.    The many inconsistencies in hyphenation and use of accents and  ligatures have been preserved as printed, with a few exceptions.  Variable and archaic spelling has also been preserved. A full  list of amendments and other notes follow the end of the book.    A considerable number of the recipe and page numbers in the  index are incorrect; however, they have been preserved as  printed.
