People have written in gratifying numbers asking for more stories about  Lad. More than seventeen hundred visitors have come all the way to  Sunnybank to see his grave. So I wrote the collection of tales which  are now included in \"Further Adventures of Lad.\" Most of them appeared,  in condensed form, in the Ladies' Home Journal.

The Coming Of Lad    In the mile-away village of Hampton, there had been a veritable  epidemic of burglaries--ranging from the theft of a brand-new ash-can  from the steps of the Methodist chapel to the ravaging of Mrs.  Blauvelt's whole lineful of clothes, on a washday dusk.    Up the Valley and down it, from Tuxedo to Ridgewood, there had been a  half-score robberies of a very different order--depredations wrought,  manifestly, by professionals; thieves whose motor cars served the  twentieth century purpose of such historic steeds as Dick Turpin's  Black Bess and Jack Shepard's Ranter. These thefts were in the line of  jewelry and the like; and were as daringly wrought as were the modest  local operators' raids on ash-can and laundry.    It is the easiest thing in the world to stir humankind's ever-tense  burglar-nerves into hysterical jangling. In house after house, for  miles of the peaceful North Jersey region, old pistols were cleaned and  loaded; window fastenings and doorlocks were inspected and new  hiding-places found for portable family treasures.    Across the lake from the village, and down the Valley from a dozen  country homes, seeped the tide of precautions. And it swirled at last  around the Place,--a thirty-acre homestead, isolated and sweet, whose  grounds ran from highway to lake; and whose wistaria-clad gray house  drowsed among big oaks midway between road and water; a furlong or more  distant from either.    The Place's family dog,--a pointer,--had died, rich in years and honor.  And the new peril of burglary made it highly needful to choose a  successor for him.    The Master talked of buying a whalebone-and-steel-and-snow bull  terrier, or a more formidable if more greedy Great Dane. But the  Mistress wanted a collie. So they compromised by getting the collie.    He reached the Place in a crampy and smelly crate; preceded by a long  envelope containing an intricate and imposing pedigree. The  burglary-preventing problem seemed solved.    But when the crate was opened and its occupant stepped gravely forth,  on the Place's veranda, the problem was revived.    All the Master and the Mistress had known about the newcomer,--apart  from his price and lofty lineage,--was that his breeder had named him  \"Lad.\"    From these meager facts they had somehow built up a picture of a huge  and grimly ferocious animal that should be a terror to all intruders  and that might in time be induced to make friends with the Place's  vouched-for occupants. In view of this, they had had a stout kennel  made and to it they had affixed with double staples a chain strong  enough to restrain a bull.    (It may as well be said here that never in all the sixteen years of his  beautiful life did Lad occupy that or any other kennel nor wear that or  any other chain.)    Even the crate which brought the new dog to the Place failed somehow to  destroy the illusion of size and fierceness. But, the moment the crate  door was opened the delusion was wrecked by Lad himself.    Out on to the porch he walked. The ramshackle crate behind him had a  ridiculous air of a chrysalis from which some bright thing had  departed. For a shaft of sunlight was shimmering athwart the veranda  floor. And into the middle of the warm bar of radiance Laddie  stepped,--and stood.    His fluffy puppy-coat of wavy mahogany-and-white caught a million  sunbeams, reflecting them back in tawny-orange glints and in a dazzle  as of snow. His forepaws were absurdly small, even for a puppy's. Above  them the ridging of the stocky leg-bones gave as clear promise of  mighty size and strength as did the amazingly deep little chest and  square shoulders.    Here one day would stand a giant among dogs, powerful as a timber-wolf,  lithe as a cat, as dangerous to foes as an angry tiger; a dog without  fear or treachery; a dog of uncanny brain and great lovingly loyal  heart and, withal, a dancing sense of fun. A dog with a soul.    All this, any canine physiologist might have read from the compact  frame, the proud head-carriage, the smolder in the deep-set sorrowful  dark eyes. To the casual observer, he was but a beautiful and appealing  and wonderfully cuddleable bunch of puppyhood.    Lad's dark eyes swept the porch, the soft swelling green of the lawn,  the flash of fire-blue lake among the trees below. Then, he deigned to  look at the group of humans at one side of him. Gravely, impersonally,  he surveyed them; not at all cowed or strange in his new surroundings;  courteously inquisitive as to the twist of luck that had set him down  here and as to the people who, presumably, were to be his future  companions.    Perhaps the stout little heart quivered just a bit, if memory went back  to his home kennel and to the rowdy throng of brothers and sisters and  most of all, to the soft furry mother against whose side he had nestled  every night since he was born. But if so, Lad was too valiant to show  homesickness by so much as a whimper. And, assuredly, this House of  Peace was infinitely better than the miserable crate wherein he had  spent twenty horrible and jouncing and smelly and noisy hours.    From one to another of the group strayed the level sorrowful gaze.  After the swift inspection, Laddie's eyes rested again on the Mistress.  For an instant, he stood, looking at her, in that mildly polite  curiosity which held no hint of personal interest.    Then, all at once, his plumy tail began to wave. Into his sad eyes  sprang a flicker of warm friendliness. Unbidden--oblivious of everyone  else he trotted across to where the Mistress sat. He put one tiny white  paw in her lap; and stood thus, looking up lovingly into her face, tail  awag, eyes shining.    \"There's no question whose dog he's going to be,\" laughed the Master.  \"He's elected you,--by acclamation.\"    The Mistress caught up into her arms the halfgrown youngster, petting  his silken head, running her white fingers through his shining mahogany  coat; making crooning little friendly noises to him.    Lad forgot he was a dignified and stately pocket-edition of a collie.  Under this spell, he changed in a second to an excessively loving and  nestling and adoring puppy.    \"Just the same,\" interposed the Master, \"we've been stung. I wanted a  dog to guard the Place and to be a menace to burglars and all that sort  of thing. And they've sent us a Teddy-Bear. I think I'll ship him back  and get a grown one. What sort of use is--?\"    \"He is going to be all those things,\" eagerly prophesied the Mistress.  \"And a hundred more. See how he loves to have me pet him! And,  look--he's learned, already, to shake hands; and--\"    \"Fine!\" applauded the Master. \"So when it comes our turn to be visited  by this motor-Raffles, the puppy will shake hands with him, and  register love of petting; and the burly marauder will be so touched by  Lad's friendliness that he'll not only spare our house but lead an  upright life ever after. I--\"    \"Don't send him back!\" she pleaded. \"He'll grow up, soon, and--\"    \"And if only the courteous burglars will wait till he's a couple of  years old,\" suggested the Master, \"he--\"    Set gently on the floor by the Mistress, Laddie had crossed to where  the Master stood. The man, glancing down, met the puppy's gaze. For an  instant he scowled at the miniature watchdog, so ludicrously different  from the ferocious brute he had expected. Then,--for some queer  reason,--he stooped and ran his hand roughly over the tawny coat,  letting it rest at last on the shapely head that did not flinch or  wriggle at his touch.    \"All right,\" he decreed. \"Let him stay. He'll be an amusing pet for  you, anyhow. And his eye has the true thoroughbred expression,--'the  look of eagles.' He may amount to something after all. Let him stay.  We'll take a chance on burglars.\"    So it was that Lad came to the Place. So it was that he demanded and  received due welcome which was ever Lad's way. The Master had been  right about the pup's proving \"an amusing pet,\" for the Mistress. From  that first hour, Lad was never willingly out of her sight. He had  adopted her. The Master, too,--in only a little lesser  wholeheartedness,--he adopted. Toward the rest of the world, from the  first, he was friendly but more or less indifferent.    Almost at once, his owners noted an odd trait in the dog's nature. He  would of course get into any or all of the thousand mischief-scrapes  which are the heritage of puppies. But, a single reproof was enough to  cure him forever of the particular form of mischief which had just been  chidden. He was one of those rare dogs that learn the Law by instinct;  and that remember for all time a command or a prohibition once given  them.    For example:--On his second day at the Place, he made a furious rush at  a neurotic mother hen and her golden convoy of chicks.

Some people, though, just can't be convinced._       BY ANNE WALKER     Illustrated by Bernklau      [Illustration]    In the dark, our glider chutes zeroed neatly on target--only Art  Benjamin missed the edge of the gorge. When we were sure Invader hadn't  heard the crashing of bushes, I climbed down after him. The climb, and  what I found, left me shaken. A Special Corps squad leader is not  expendable--by order. Clyde Esterbrook, my second and ICEG mate, would  have to mine the viaduct while my nerve and glycogen stabilized.    We timed the patrols. Clyde said, \"Have to wait till a train's coming.  No time otherwise.\" Well, it was his show. When the next pair of  burly-coated men came over at a trot, he breathed, \"Now!\" and ghosted  out almost before they were clear.    I switched on the ICEG--inter-cortical encephalograph--planted in my  temporal bone. My own senses could hear young Ferd breathing, feel and  smell the mat of pine needles under me. Through Clyde's, I could hear  the blind whuffle of wind in the girders, feel the crude wood of ties  and the iron-cold molding of rails in the star-dark. I could feel, too,  an odd, lilting elation in his mind, as if this savage universe were a  good thing to take on--spray guns, cold, and all.    We wanted to set the mine so the wreckage would clobber a trail below,  one like they'd built in Burma and Japan, where you wouldn't think a  monkey could go; but it probably carried more supplies than the viaduct  itself. So Clyde made adjustments precisely, just as we'd figured it  with the model back at base. It was a tricky, slow job in the bitter  dark.    I began to figure: If he armed it for this train, and ran, she'd go off  while we were on location and we'd be drenched in searchlights and spray  guns. Already, through his fingers, I felt the hum in the rails that  every tank-town-reared kid knows. I turned up my ICEG. \"All right,  Clyde, get back. Arm it when she's gone past, for the next one.\"    I felt him grin, felt his lips form words: \"I'll do better than that,  Willie. Look, Daddy-o, no hands!\" He slid over the edge and rested  elbows and ribs on the raw tie ends.    We're all acrobats in the Corps. But I didn't like this act one little  bit. Even if he could hang by his hands, the heavy train would jolt him  off. But I swallowed my thoughts.    He groped with his foot, contacted a sloping beam, and brought his other  foot in. I felt a dull, scraping slither under his moccasin soles.  \"Frost,\" he thought calmly, rubbed a clear patch with the edge of his  foot, put his weight on it, and transferred his hands to the beam with a  twist we hadn't learned in Corps school. My heart did a double-take; one  slip and he'd be off into the gorge, and the frost stung, melting under  his bare fingers. He lay in the trough of the massive H-beam, slid down  about twenty feet to where it made an angle with an upright, and wedged  himself there. It took all of twenty seconds, really. But I let out a  breath as if I'd been holding it for minutes.    As he settled, searchlights began skimming the bridge. If he'd been  running, he'd have been shot to a sieve. As it was, they'd never see him  in the mingled glare and black.    His heart hadn't even speeded up beyond what was required by exertion.  The train roared around a shoulder and onto the viaduct, shaking it like  an angry hand. But as the boxcars thunder-clattered above his head, he  was peering into the gulf at a string of feeble lights threading the  bottom. \"There's the flywalk, Willie. They know their stuff. But we'll  get it.\" Then, as the caboose careened over and the searchlights cut  off, \"Well, that gives us ten minutes before the patrol comes back.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He levered onto his side, a joint at a time, and began to climb the  beam. Never again for me, even by proxy! You just _couldn't_ climb that  thing nohow! The slope was too steep. The beam was too massive to  shinny, yet too narrow to lie inside and elbow up. The metal was too  smooth, and scummed with frost. His fingers were beginning to numb.  And--he _was_ climbing!    In each fin of the beam, every foot or so, was a round hole. He'd get  one finger into a hole and pull, inching his body against the beam. He  timed himself to some striding music I didn't know, not fast but no  waste motion, even the pauses rhythmic.    I tell you. I was sweating under my leathers. Maybe I should have  switched the ICEG off, for my own sake if not to avoid distracting  Clyde. But I was hypnotized, climbing.    In the old days, when you were risking your neck, you were supposed to  think great solemn thoughts. Recently, you're supposed to think about  something silly like a singing commercial. Clyde's mind was neither  posturing in front of his mental mirror nor running in some feverish  little circle. He faced terror as big as the darkness from gorge bottom  to stars, and he was just simply as big as it was--sheer life exulting  in defying the dark, the frost and wind and the zombie grip of Invader.  I envied him.    Then his rhythm checked. Five feet from the top, he reached confidently  for a finger hole ... No hole.    He had already reached as high as he could without shifting his purchase  and risking a skid--and even his wrestler's muscles wouldn't make the  climb again. My stomach quaked: Never see sunlight in the trees any  more, just cling till dawn picked you out like a crow's nest in a dead  tree; or drop ...    Not Clyde. His flame of life crouched in anger. Not only the malice of  nature and the rage of enemies, but human shiftlessness against him too?  Good! He'd take it on.    Shoulder, thigh, knee, foot scraped off frost. He jammed his jaw against  the wet iron. His right hand never let go, but it crawled up the fin of  the strut like a blind animal, while the load on his points of purchase  mounted--watchmaker co-ordination where you'd normally think in  boilermaker terms. The flame sank to a spark as he focused, but it never  blinked out. This was not the anticipated, warded danger, but the trick  punch from nowhere. This was It. A sneak squall buffeted him. I cursed  thinly. But he sensed an extra purchase from its pressure, and reached  the last four inches with a swift glide. The next hole was there.    He waited five heartbeats, and pulled. He began at the muscular  disadvantage of aligned joints. He had to make it the first time; if you  can't do it with a dollar, you won't do it with the change. But as elbow  and shoulder bent, the flame soared again: Score one more for life!    A minute later, he hooked his arm over the butt of a tie, his chin, his  other arm, and hung a moment. He didn't throw a knee up, just rolled and  lay between the rails. Even as he relaxed, he glanced at his watch:  three minutes to spare. Leisurely, he armed the mine and jogged back to  me and Ferd.    As I broke ICEG contact, his flame had sunk to an ember glow of  anticipation.           *       *       *       *       *    We had almost reached the cave pricked on our map, when we heard the  slam of the mine, wee and far-off. We were lying doggo looking out at  the snow peaks incandescent in dawn when the first Invader patrols  trailed by below. Our equipment was a miracle of hot food and basic  medication. Not pastimes, though; and by the second day of hiding, I was  thinking too much. There was Clyde, an Inca chief with a thread of black  mustache and incongruous hazel eyes, my friend and ICEG mate--what made  him tick? Where did he get his delight in the bright eyes of danger? How  did he gear his daredevil valor, not to the icy iron and obligatory  killing, but to the big music and stars over the gorge? But in the  Corps, we don't ask questions and, above all, never eavesdrop on ICEG.    Young Ferd wasn't so inhibited. Benjamin's death had shaken him--losing  your ICEG mate is like losing an eye. He began fly-fishing Clyde: How  had Clyde figured that stunt, in the dark, with the few minutes he'd  had?    \"There's always a way, Ferd, if you're fighting for what you really  want.\"    \"Well, I want to throw out Invader, all right, but--\"    \"That's the start, of course, but beyond that--\" He changed the subject:  perhaps only I knew of his dream about a stronghold for rebels far in  these mountains. He smiled. \"I guess you get used to calculated risks.  Except for imagination, you're as safe walking a ledge twenty stories  up, as down on the sidewalk.\"    \"Not if you trip.\"    \"That's the calculated risk. If you climb, you get used to it.\"    \"Well, how did you _get_ used to it? Were you a mountaineer or an  acrobat?\"    \"In a way, both.\" Clyde smiled again, a trifle bitterly and switched the  topic. \"Anyway, I've been in action for the duration except some time in  hospital.\"    Ferd was onto that boner like an infielder. To get into SC you have to  be not only championship fit, but have no history of injury that could  crop up to haywire you in a pinch. So, \"Hospital? You sure don't show it  now.\"    Clyde was certainly below par. To cover his slip he backed into a  bigger, if less obvious, one. \"Oh, I was in that Operation Armada at  Golden Gate. Had to be patched up.\"    He must have figured, Ferd had been a kid then, and I hadn't been too  old. Odds were, we'd recall the episode, and no more. Unfortunately, I'd  been a ham operator and I'd been in the corps that beamed those  fireships onto the Invader supply fleet in the dense fog. The whole  episode was burned into my brain. It had been kamikaze stuff, though  there'd been a theoretical chance of the thirty men escaping, to justify  sending them out. Actually, one escape boat did get back with three men.    I'd learned about those men, out of morbid, conscience-"]]]
