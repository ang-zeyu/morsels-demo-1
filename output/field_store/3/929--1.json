The entity of Serbia  and Montenegro is now officially known as Yugoslavia.  There are new  entries on:  Currency code, HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate, HIV/AIDS  - deaths, HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS, Internet users, and  Internet country code.  The Background entry, which was introduced in  the 1999 edition, has now been completed for all 267 entities in the  Factbook.  The individual country maps are being revised.  Some new  maps with elevation extremes and a partial geographic grid are included  in this edition.      Abbreviations  This information is included in Appendix A: Abbreviations, which  includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook, with  their expansions.    Acronyms  An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter of each  successive word in a term or phrase.  In general, an acronym made up  solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is  rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic Treaty  Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of Southeast  Asian Nations).  In general, an acronym made up of more than the first  letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered with only an  initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications Satellite  Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned Movement).  Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between initially  identical terms (WTO:  WTrO for World Trade Organization and WToO for  World Tourism Organization.)    Administrative divisions  This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-  order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet  acted on by BGN are noted.    Age structure  This entry provides the distribution of the population according to  age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64  years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects a  nation's key socioeconomic issues.
