PREFACE.      Fair Italy, the land of song and cradle of the Arts, has been so often  written about, and so well described both in prose and in verse, that I  feel there is a presumption in my attempting to say anything fresh of  that classic land, its art treasures, and its glorious past. But within  the last few years a new Italy has sprung into existence--the dream of  Cavour has been realized; and, contrary to all predictions, she has  evinced a union and cohesiveness so complete as to surprise all, and  possibly disappoint some who were jealous of her.    What was once a conglomeration of petty rival states is now one  constitutionally governed kingdom. Italy has ceased to be only a  geographical name; she is now a nation whose voice is listened to at the  council tables of the Great Powers.    The old terms of Piedmontese, Tuscan, Lombard, and Neapolitan, have no  longer aught but a local significance; from the Alps to Tarentum every  one glories in the name of free united Italy, and feels proud of being  an Italian.    Young Italy is so rapidly developing the resources of her gifted people  and of her fruitful lands, that she daily becomes more interesting to  all who sympathize with a free and vigorous country; more especially to  the English, who have many interests in common with her, and few, if  any, reasons to fear either antagonism or competition.    And the beautiful Riviera--        Where God's pure air, sweet flowers, blue sea and skies,      Combine to make an earthly Paradise.    Yes! the Riviera is certainly one of the loveliest spots on this fair  earth, and is visited by streams of human beings, lovers of nature and  students of art; but is more especially dear to the thousands of sickly  invalids, who--        Journeying there from lands of wintry clime,      Find life and health 'midst scenery sublime.    But, to be truly candid, I must confess that, while humbly trusting I  have succeeded in making this little book both interesting and  instructive, one of the chief reasons for my putting pen to paper has  been to make an effort, however feeble, to expose the deadly evils of  the plague-spot of this paradise, Monte Carlo.    From this centre there circulates a gambling fever not only throughout  the Riviera--from Cannes to Genoa--but everywhere its victims may carry  it. After being stamped out from all the German watering-places, the  demon \"Play\" has fixed his abode in this fair spot, in the very pathway  of invalids and others, and, under the aegis of a corrupt prince and his  subjects who share the proceeds of the gaming-tables, this valued health  resort, which was surely designed by a beneficent Creator for the  happiness of His creatures, is turned into a pandemonium.        \"Base men to use it to so base effect.\"    Few can be wholly unaware of the sad effects resulting from this  gambling mania, whereby the happiness of many homes is wrecked, and  thousands of our fellow-creatures are brought to ruin and a shameful  end.    During the past season the public papers have teemed with instances of  Monte Carlo suicides,[A] the lifeless bodies of its victims frequently  being found at early dawn in the charming gardens surrounding the  Casino. The gen d'arme patrol is so accustomed to the occurrence, it is  said, as to view the object with perfect _sang froid_, but, let us  rather hope, with pitying eye.    It may possibly be said, Why all this virtuous indignation about Monte  Carlo, when gambling, to a frightful extent, is carried on at our clubs  and stock exchanges in England? I can only answer, two wrongs can never  make one right; besides, Monte Carlo cannot be allowed to exist as an  independent principality when conducted so dishonestly and detrimentally  to the highest interests of humanity.    I am thankful to feel that the matter has now been brought before the  Parliaments of England and Italy, and even France, and has been the  subject of diplomatic remonstrance. This is hopeful, but I have the  greater hope in the power of public opinion and sympathy against this  monstrous evil; and also in the belief that one of the highest  developments of this nineteenth century is the recognition of the truth  that \"I am my brother's keeper.\"         LONDON,            _March, 1884._    [A] See Appendix.

Quarter-sawed oak is the most suitable wood for this handsome  piece of mission furniture. The material should be ordered from the mill  ready cut to length, squared and sanded. Following is a list of the  stock needed:      2 back posts, 2 by 2 by 47-3/4 in.    2 front posts, 2 by 2 by 45-1/2 in.    4 rails, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 50-1/2 in.    2 end rails, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 18-1/2 in.    4 end rails, 3/4 by 4 by 18-1/2 in.    4 pieces for end panel, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 21 in.    2 panels, 3/8 by 12 by 21 in.    1 top board, 3/4 by 17-1/2 by 47-1/4 in.    1 back board, 3/4 by 11-1/2 by 47-1/4 in.    1 shelf board, 3/4 by 2 by 46 in.    2 brackets, 1 by 2 by 7-3/4 in.    4 pieces for doors, 3/4 by 4 by 11 in.    2 panels, 3/8 by 11 by 17-1/2 in.    1 piece for drawer, 3/4 by 8 by 22-1/2 in.    1 piece for drawer, 3/4 by 7-1/2 by 22-1/2 in.    1 piece for drawer, 3/4 by 7 by 22-1/2 in.    2 pieces, 1/2 by 8 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.    2 pieces, 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.    2 pieces, 1/2 by 7 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.    1 piece, 1/2 by 8 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.    1 piece, 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.    1 piece, 1/2 by 7 by 19-1/4 in.; soft wood.    1 bottom board, 3/4 by 17-1/2 by 47-1/4 in.; soft wood.    2 partitions (several pieces), 3/4 by 20 by 24-3/4 in.    2 front pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 23 in.    2 back pieces. 3/4 by 2 by 23 in.; soft wood.    2 side pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 21-1/2 in.; soft wood.    1 back (several pieces), 3/8 by 25 by 46 in.    1 mirror frame (to suit mirror).    X/    Start to work on the four posts by squaring them up to the proper length  in pairs and beveling the tops as shown. Clamp all four pieces on a flat  surface with the bottom ends even, then lay out the mortises for the  rails and panels on all four pieces at once with a try-square. This  insures getting the mortises all the same height. The back posts also  have a mortise cut in them at the top for the back board as shown. Lay  out the tenons on the ends of the front and back rails in the same  manner. Cut them to fit the mortises in the posts, also rabbet the back  rails for the backing. Cut tenons on the end rails and rabbet them and  the side pieces for the panels.    Lay out the top and bottom boards to the proper size and notch the  corners to fit about the posts. These boards are fastened to the  1-1/2-in. square rails with dowels and glue. They can now be glued  together and set away to dry. The top board is of oak, and be sure to  get the best side up, while the bottom one can be made of soft wood if  desired.    The partitions are made of several boards glued together. Be careful to  get an oak board on the outer edge. The drawer slides are set into the  partitions as shown and are fastened in place with screws from the  inside.    The top back board has a tenon on each end that fits into the mortises  in the back posts and is rounded at the top as shown. The shelf is also  rounded at the ends and is fastened to the back with screws.    A plate glass mirror should be provided for the back. This is fitted to  the back board as shown, then the brackets put up at the ends of the  mirror frame.    The main parts are now ready to be assembled and glued together. Before  applying any glue, see that all the joints fit together perfectly. The  end rails and the panels are glued together first and allowed to dry. Be  very careful to get the parts clamped together perfectly square and  straight, else you will have trouble later on. When these ends are dry  slip them on the tenons on the front and back rails which are already  fastened to the top and bottom boards.    The back board and the partitions must be in place when this is done.  Pin and glue the joints and clamp the whole together square and leave to  dry.    The doors are now made by mortising the top and bottom pieces to take  the 3/8-in. panel which is glued in place. The drawers are made as shown  in the sketch. The front board should be oak, but the remainder can be  made of soft wood. The joints are nailed and glued. Suitable hinges for  the doors and handles for the drawers should be provided. Antique copper  trimmings look very well with this style of furniture and can be secured  at most any hardware store.    The back is made of soft wood and is put on in the usual manner. Scrape  all surplus glue from about the joints, as stain will not take where  there is any glue. Finish smooth with fine sandpaper, then apply the  stain you like best. This can be any one of the many mission stains  supplied by the trade for this purpose.          OAK STAIN      An easy and at the"]]]
