Weinbaum, pp. 1-27. Extensive research did not  uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was  renewed.          A MARTIAN ODYSSEY      Jarvis stretched himself as luxuriously as he could in the cramped  general quarters of the _Ares_.    \"Air you can breathe!\" he exulted. \"It feels as thick as soup after the  thin stuff out there!\" He nodded at the Martian landscape stretching  flat and desolate in the light of the nearer moon, beyond the glass of  the port.    The other three stared at him sympathetically--Putz, the engineer,  Leroy, the biologist, and Harrison, the astronomer and captain of the  expedition. Dick Jarvis was chemist of the famous crew, the _Ares_  expedition, first human beings to set foot on the mysterious neighbor of  the earth, the planet Mars. This, of course, was in the old days, less  than twenty years after the mad American Doheny perfected the atomic  blast at the cost of his life, and only a decade after the equally mad  Cardoza rode on it to the moon. They were true pioneers, these four of  the _Ares_. Except for a half-dozen moon expeditions and the ill-fated  de Lancey flight aimed at the seductive orb of Venus, they were the  first men to feel other gravity than earth's, and certainly the first  successful crew to leave the earth-moon system. And they deserved that  success when one considers the difficulties and discomforts--the months  spent in acclimatization chambers back on earth, learning to breathe the  air as tenuous as that of Mars, the challenging of the void in the tiny  rocket driven by the cranky reaction motors of the twenty-first century,  and mostly the facing of an absolutely unknown world.    Jarvis stretched and fingered the raw and peeling tip of his  frost-bitten nose. He sighed again contentedly.    \"Well,\" exploded Harrison abruptly, \"are we going to hear what happened?  You set out all shipshape in an auxiliary rocket, we don't get a peep  for ten days, and finally Putz here picks you out of a lunatic ant-heap  with a freak ostrich as your pal! Spill it, man!\"    \"Speel?\" queried Leroy perplexedly. \"Speel what?\"    \"He means '_spiel_',\" explained Putz soberly. \"It iss to tell.\"    Jarvis met Harrison's amused glance without the shadow of a smile.  \"That's right, Karl,\" he said in grave agreement with Putz. \"_Ich spiel  es!_\" He grunted comfortably and began.    \"According to orders,\" he said, \"I watched Karl here take off toward the  North, and then I got into my flying sweat-box and headed South. You'll  remember, Cap--we had orders not to land, but just scout about for  points of interest. I set the two cameras clicking and buzzed along,  riding pretty high--about two thousand feet--for a couple of reasons.  First, it gave the cameras a greater field, and second, the under-jets  travel so far in this half-vacuum they call air here that they stir up  dust if you move low.\"    \"We know all that from Putz,\" grunted Harrison. \"I wish you'd saved the  films, though. They'd have paid the cost of this junket; remember how  the public mobbed the first moon pictures?\"    \"The films are safe,\" retorted Jarvis. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"as I said, I  buzzed along at a pretty good clip; just as we figured, the wings  haven't much lift in this air at less than a hundred miles per hour, and  even then I had to use the under-jets.    \"So, with the speed and the altitude and the blurring caused by the  under-jets, the seeing wasn't any too good. I could see enough, though,  to distinguish that what I sailed over was just more of this grey plain  that we'd been examining the whole week since our landing--same blobby  growths and the same eternal carpet of crawling little plant-animals, or  biopods, as Leroy calls them. So I sailed along, calling back my  position every hour as instructed, and not knowing whether you heard  me.\"    \"I did!\" snapped Harrison.    \"A hundred and fifty miles south,\" continued Jarvis imperturbably, \"the  surface changed to a sort of low plateau, nothing but desert and  orange-tinted sand. I figured that we were right in our guess, then,  and this grey plain we dropped on was really the Mare Cimmerium which  would make my orange desert the region called Xanthus. If I were right,  I ought to hit another grey plain, the Mare Chronium in another couple  of hundred miles, and then another orange desert, Thyle I or II. And so  I did.\"    \"Putz verified our position a week and a half ago!\" grumbled the  captain. \"Let's get to the point.\"    \"Coming!\" remarked Jarvis. \"Twenty miles into Thyle--believe it or  not--I crossed a canal!\"    \"Putz photographed a hundred! Let's hear something new!\"    \"And did he also see a city?\"    \"Twenty of 'em, if you call those heaps of mud cities!\"    \"Well,\" observed Jarvis, \"from here on I'll be telling a few things Putz  didn't see!\" He rubbed his tingling nose, and continued. \"I knew that I  had sixteen hours of daylight at this season, so eight hours--eight  hundred miles--from here, I decided to turn back. I was still over  Thyle, whether I or II I'm not sure, not more than twenty-five miles  into it. And right there, Putz's pet motor quit!\"    \"Quit? How?\" Putz was solicitous.    \"The atomic blast got weak. I started losing altitude right away, and  suddenly there I was with a thump right in the middle of Thyle! Smashed  my nose on the window, too!\" He rubbed the injured member ruefully.    \"Did you maybe try vashing der combustion chamber mit acid sulphuric?\"  inquired Putz. \"Sometimes der lead giffs a secondary radiation--\"    \"Naw!\" said Jarvis disgustedly. \"I wouldn't try that, of course--not  more than ten times! Besides, the bump flattened the landing gear and  busted off the under-jets. Suppose I got the thing working--what then?  Ten miles with the blast coming right out of the bottom and I'd have  melted the floor from under me!\" He rubbed his nose again. \"Lucky for me  a pound only weighs seven ounces here, or I'd have been mashed flat!\"    \"I could have fixed!\" ejaculated the engineer. \"I bet it vas not  serious.\"    \"Probably not,\" agreed Jarvis sarcastically. \"Only it wouldn't fly.  Nothing serious, but I had my choice of waiting to be picked up or  trying to walk back--eight hundred miles, and perhaps twenty days before  we had to leave! Forty miles a day! Well,\" he concluded, \"I chose to  walk. Just as much chance of being picked up, and it kept me busy.\"    \"We'd have found you,\" said Harrison.    \"No doubt. Anyway, I rigged up a harness from some seat straps, and put  the water tank on my back, took a cartridge belt and revolver, and some  iron rations, and started out.\"    \"Water tank!\" exclaimed the little biologist, Leroy. \"She weigh  one-quarter ton!\"    \"Wasn't full. Weighed about two hundred and fifty pounds earth-weight,  which is eighty-five here. Then, besides, my own personal two hundred  and ten pounds is only seventy on Mars, so, tank and all, I grossed a  hundred and fifty-five, or fifty-five pounds less than my everyday  earth-weight. I figured on that when I undertook the forty-mile daily  stroll. Oh--of course I took a thermo-skin sleeping bag for these wintry  Martian nights.    \"Off I went, bouncing along pretty quickly. Eight hours of daylight  meant twenty miles or more. It got tiresome, of course--plugging along  over a soft sand desert with nothing to see, not even Leroy's crawling  biopods. But an hour or so brought me to the canal--just a dry ditch  about four hundred feet wide, and straight as a railroad on its own  company map.    \"There'd been water in it sometime, though. The ditch was covered with  what looked like a nice green lawn. Only, as I approached, the lawn  moved out of my way!\"    \"Eh?\" said Leroy.    \"Yeah, it was a relative of your biopods. I caught one--a little  grass-like blade about as long as my finger, with two thin, stemmy  legs.\"    \"He is where?\" Leroy was eager.    \"He is let go! I had to move, so I plowed along with the walking grass  opening in front and closing behind. And then I was out on the orange  desert of Thyle again.    \"I plugged steadily along, cussing the sand that made going so tiresome,  and, incidentally, cussing that cranky motor of yours, Karl. It was just  before twilight that I reached the edge of Thyle, and looked down over  the gray Mare Chronium. And I knew there was seventy-five miles of  _that_ to be walked over, and then a couple of hundred miles of that  Xanthus desert, and about as much more Mare Cimmerium. Was I pleased? I  started cussing you fellows for not picking me up!\"    \"We were trying, you sap!\" said Harrison.    \"That didn't help. Well, I figured I might as well use what was left of  daylight in getting down the cliff that bounded Thyle. I found an easy  place, and down I went. Mare Chronium was just the same sort of place as  this--crazy leafless plants and a bunch of crawlers; I gave it a glance  and hauled out my sleeping bag. Up to that time, you know, I hadn't seen  anything worth worrying about on this half-dead world--nothing  dangerous, that is.\"    \"Did you?\" queried Harrison.    \"_Did I!_ You'll hear about it when I come to it. Well, I was just about  to turn in when suddenly I heard the wildest sort of shenanigans!\"    \"Vot iss shenanigans?\" inquired Putz.    \"He says, 'Je ne sais quoi,'\" explained Leroy. \"It is to say, 'I don't  know what.'\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Jarvis. \"I didn't know what, so I sneaked over to  find out. There was a racket like a flock of crows eating a bunch of  canaries--whistles, cackles, caws, trills, and what have you. I rounded  a clump of stumps, and there was Tweel!\"    \"Tweel?\" said Harrison, and \"Tveel?\" said Leroy and Putz.    \"That freak ostrich,\" explained the narrator. \"At least, Tweel is as  near as I can pronounce it without sputtering. He called it something  like 'Trrrweerrlll.'\"    \"What was he doing?\" asked the Captain.
