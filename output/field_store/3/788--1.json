BEDFORD FORREST'S FAREWELL TO HIS COMMAND, MAY 9, 1865,  GAINESVILLE, ALABAMA.    _The cause for which you have so long and so manfully struggled, and for  which you have braved dangers, endured privations and sufferings, and  made so many sacrifices, is today hopeless...._    _Civil war, such as you have passed through naturally engenders feelings  of animosity, hatred and revenge. It is our duty to divest ourselves of  all such feelings; and, as far as in our power to do so, to cultivate  friendly feelings toward those with whom we have so long contended, and  heretofore so widely, but honestly, differed...._    _... In bidding you farewell, rest assured that you carry with you my  best wishes for your future welfare and happiness. Without, in any way,  referring to the merits of the cause in which we have been engaged, your  courage and determination, as exhibited on many hard-fought fields, have  elicited the respect and admiration of friend and foe. And I now  cheerfully and gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to the officers  and men of my command, whose zeal, fidelity and unflinching bravery have  been the great source of my success in arms._    _I have never, on the field of battle, sent you where I was unwilling to  go myself; nor would I now advise you to a course which I felt myself  unwilling to pursue. You have been good soldiers; you can be good  citizens. Obey the laws, preserve your honor, and the Government to  which you have surrendered can afford to be, and will be, magnanimous._    N. B. FORREST, _Lieutenant General_           *       *       *       *       *          1    _Ride with Morgan_      The stocky roan switched tail angrily against a persistent fly and  lipped water, dripping big drops back to the surface of the brook. His  rider moved swiftly, with an economy of action, to unsaddle, wipe the  besweated back with a wisp of last year's dried grass, and wash down  each mud-spattered leg with stream water. Always care for the mount  first--when a man's life, as well as the safety of his mission, depended  on four subordinate legs more than on his own two.    Though he had little claim to a thoroughbred's points, the roan was as  much a veteran of the forces as his groom, with all a veteran's ability  to accept and enjoy small favors of the immediate present without  speculating too much concerning the future. He blew gustily in pleasure  under the attention and began to sample a convenient stand of spring  green.    His mount cared for, Drew Rennie swung up saddle, blanket, and the  meager possessions which he had brought out of Virginia two weeks ago,  to the platform in a crooked tree overhanging the brook. He settled  beside them on the well-seasoned timbers of the old tree house to  rummage through his saddlebags.    The platform had been there a long time--before Chickamauga and the Ohio  Raid, before the first roll of drums in '61. Drew pulled a creased shirt  out of the bags and sat with it draped over one knee, remembering....    Sheldon Barrett and he--they had built it together one hot week in  summer--had named it Boone's Fort. And it was the only thing at Red  Springs Drew had really ever owned. His dark eyes were fixed now on  something more than the branches about him, and his mouth tightened  until his face was not quite sullen, only shuttered.    Five years ago--only five years? Yes, five years next month! But the  past two years of his own personal freedom--and war--those seemed to  equal ten. Now there was no one left to remember the fort's existence,  which made it perfect for his present purpose.    The warmth of the sun, beating down through yet young leaves, made Drew  brush his battered slouch hat to the flooring and luxuriate in the heat.  Sometimes he didn't think he'd ever get the bite of last winter's cold  out of his bones. The light pointed up every angle of jaw and cheekbone,  making it clear that experience--hard experience--and not years had  melted away boyish roundness of chin line, narrowed the watchful eyes  ever alert to his surroundings. A cavalry scout was wary, or he ceased  to be a scout, or maybe even alive.    Shirt in hand, Drew dropped lightly to the ground and with the same  dispatch as he had cared for his horse, made his own toilet, scrubbing  his too-thin body with a sigh of content as heartfelt as that the roan  had earlier voiced.    The fresh shirt was a dark brown-gray, but the patched breeches were  Yankee blue, and the boots he pulled on when he had bathed were also  the enemy's gift, good stout leather he'd been lucky enough to find in a  supply wagon they had captured a month ago. Butternut shirt, Union pants  and boots--the unofficial standard uniform of most any trooper of the  Army of the Tennessee in this month of May, 1864. And he had garments  which were practically intact. What was one patch on the seat nowadays?    For the first time Drew grinned at his reflection in the small mirror he  had been using, when he scraped a half week's accumulation of soft beard  from his face. Sure, he was all spruced up now, ready to make a polite  courtesy call at the big house. The grin did not fade, but was gone in a  flash, leaving no hint of softness now about his gaunt features, no  light in the intent, measuring depths of his dark gray eyes.    A call at Red Springs was certainly the last thing in the world for him  to consider seriously. His last interview within its walls could still  make him wince when he recalled it, word by scalding word. No, there was  no place for a Rennie--and a Rebel Rennie to make matters blacker--under  the righteous roof of Alexander Mattock!    Hatred could be a red-hot burning to choke a man's throat, leaving him  speechless and hurting inside. Since he had ridden out of Red Springs he  had often been cold, very often hungry--and under orders willingly,  which would have surprised his grandfather--but in another way he had  been free as never before in all his life. In the army, the past did not  matter at all if one did one's job well. And in the army, the civilian  world was as far away as if it were conducted in the cold chasms of the  moon.    Drew leaned back against the tree trunk, wanting to yield to the soft  wind and the swinging privacy of the embowered tree house, wanting to  forget everything and just lie there for a while in the only part of the  past he remembered happily.    But he had his orders--horses for General Morgan, horses and information  to feed back to that long column of men riding or trudging westward on  booted, footsore feet up the trail through the Virginia mountains on the  way home to Kentucky. These were men who carried memories of the Ohio  defeat last year which they were determined to wipe out this season,  just as a lot of them had to flush with gunsmoke the stench of a  Northern prison barracks from their nostrils.    And there were horses at Red Springs. To mount Morgan's men on Alexander  Mattock's best stock was a prospect which had its appeal. Drew tossed  his haversack back to the platform and added his carbine to it. The army  Colts in his belt holsters would not be much hindrance while crawling  through cover, but the larger weapon might be.    He thumped a measure of dust from his hat, settled it over hair as black  as that felt had once been, and crossed the brook with a running leap.  The roan lifted his head to watch Drew go and then settled back to  grazing. This, too, followed a pattern both man and horse had practiced  for a long time.    Drew could almost imagine that he was again hunting Sheldon as a  \"Shawnee\" on the warpath while he dodged from one bush to the next. Only  Chickamauga stood between the past and now--and Sheldon Barrett would  never again range ahead, in play or earnest.    The scout came out on a small rise where the rails of the fence were  cloaked on his side by brush. Drew lay flat, his chin propped upon his  crooked arm to look down the gradual incline of the pasture to the  training paddock. Beyond that stood the big house, its native brick  settling back slowly into the same earth from which it had been molded  in 1795.    In the pasture were the brood mares, five of them, each with an  attendant foal, all long legs and broom tail, still young enough to be  bewildered by so large and new a world. In the paddock....

At  a glance you can see what a fine, round, splendid fellow Bunyip Bluegum  is, without me telling you. At a second glance you can see that the  Uncle is more square than round, and that his face has whiskers on it.    [Illustration]    Looked at sideways you can still see what a splendid fellow Bunyip is,  though you can only see one of his Uncle's whiskers.    [Illustration]    Observed from behind, however, you completely lose sight of the  whiskers, and so fail to realize how immensely important they are. In  fact, these very whiskers were the chief cause of Bunyip's leaving home  to see the world, for, as he often said to himself--      'Whiskers alone are bad enough    Attached to faces coarse and rough;    But how much greater their offence is    When stuck on Uncles' countenances.'    [Illustration]    The plain truth was that Bunyip and his Uncle lived in a small house in  a tree, and there was no room for the whiskers. What was worse, the  whiskers were red, and they blew about in the wind, and Uncle  Wattleberry would insist on bringing them to the dinner table with him,  where they got in the soup.    Bunyip Bluegum was a tidy bear, and he objected to whisker soup, so he  was forced to eat his meals outside, which was awkward, and besides,  lizards came and borrowed his soup.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    His Uncle refused to listen to reason on the subject of his whiskers. It  was quite useless giving him hints, such as presents of razors, and  scissors, and boxes of matches to burn them off. On such occasions he  would remark--      'Shaving may add an air that's somewhat brisker,    For dignity, commend me to the whisker.'    Or, when more deeply moved, he would exclaim--      'As noble thoughts the inward being grace,    So noble whiskers dignify the face.'    Prayers and entreaties to remove the whiskers being of no avail, Bunyip  decided to leave home without more ado.    The trouble was that he couldn't make up his mind whether to be a  Traveller or a Swagman. You can't go about the world being nothing, but  if you are a traveller you have to carry a bag, while if you are a  swagman you have to carry a swag, and the question is: Which is the  heavier?    [Illustration]    At length he decided to put the matter before Egbert Rumpus Bumpus, the  poet, and ask his advice. He found Egbert busy writing poems on a slate.  He was so busy that he only had time to sing out--      'Don't interrupt the poet, friend,    Until his poem's at an end.'    and went on writing harder than ever. He wrote all down one side of the  slate and all up the other, and then remarked--      'As there's no time to finish that,    The time has come to have our chat.    Be quick, my friend, your business state,    Before I take another slate.'    [Illustration]    'The fact is,' said the Bunyip, 'I have decided to see the world, and I  cannot make up my mind whether to be a Traveller or a Swagman. Which  would you advise?'    Then said the Poet--      'As you've no bags it's plain to see    A traveller you cannot be;    And as a swag you haven't either    You cannot be a swagman neither.    For travellers must carry bags,    And swagmen have to hump their swags      Like bottle-ohs or ragmen.    As you have neither swag nor bag    You must remain a simple wag,      And not a swag- or bagman.'    [Illustration]    'Dear me,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'I never thought of that. What must I do  in order to see the world without carrying swags or bags?'    The Poet thought deeply, put on his eyeglass, and said impressively--      'Take my advice, don't carry bags,    For bags are just as bad as swags;      They're never made to measure.    To see the world, your simple trick    Is but to take a walking-stick--      Assume an air of pleasure,    And tell the people near and far    You stroll about because you are      A Gentleman of Leisure.'    [Illustration]    'You have solved the problem,' said Bunyip Bluegum, and, wringing his  friend's hand, he ran straight home, took his Uncle's walking-stick, and  assuming an air of pleasure, set off to see the world.    He found a great many things to see, such as dandelions, and ants, and  traction engines, and bolting horses, and furniture being removed,  besides being kept busy raising his hat, and passing the time of day  with people on the road, for he was a very well-bred young fellow,  polite in his manners, graceful in his attitudes, and able to converse  on a great variety of subjects, having read all the best Australian  poets.    Unfortunately, in the hurry of leaving home, he had forgotten to  provide himself with food, and at lunch time found himself attacked by  the pangs of hunger.    'Dear me,' he said, 'I feel quite faint. I had no idea that one's  stomach was so important. I have everything I require, except food; but  without food everything is rather less than nothing.      'I've got a stick to walk with.    I've got a mind to think with.    I've got a voice to talk with.    I've got an eye to wink with.    I've lots of teeth to eat with,    A brand new hat to bow with,    A pair of fists to beat with,    A rage to have a row with.    No joy it brings      To have indeed    A lot of things      One does not need.    Observe my doleful plight.      For here am I without a crumb      To satisfy a raging tum--    O what an oversight!'    As he was indulging in these melancholy reflexions he came round a bend  in the road, and discovered two people in the very act of having lunch.  These people were none other than Bill Barnacle, the sailor, and his  friend, Sam Sawnoff, the penguin bold.    Bill was a small man with a large hat, a beard half as large as his hat,  and feet half as large as his beard. Sam Sawnoff's feet were sitting  down and his body was standing up, because his feet were so short and  his body so long that he had to do both together. They had a pudding in  a basin, and the smell that arose from it was so delightful that Bunyip  Bluegum was quite unable to pass on.    [Illustration]    'Excuse me,' he said, raising his hat, 'but am I right in supposing that  this is a steak-and-kidney pudding?'    'At present it is,' said Bill Barnacle.    'It smells delightful,' said Bunyip Bluegum.    'It is delightful,' said Bill, eating a large mouthful.    Bunyip Bluegum was too much of a gentleman to invite himself to lunch,  but he said carelessly, 'Am I right in supposing that there are onions  in this pudding?'    Before Bill could reply, a thick, angry voice came out of the pudding,  saying--      'Onions, bunions, corns and crabs,    Whiskers, wheels and hansom cabs,    Beef and bottles, beer and bones,    Give him a feed and end his groans.'    'Albert, Albert,' said Bill to the Puddin', 'where's your manners?'    'Where's yours?' said the Puddin' rudely, 'guzzling away there, and  never so much as offering this stranger a slice.'    'There you are,' said Bill. 'There's nothing this Puddin' enjoys more  than offering slices of himself to strangers.'    'How very polite of him,' said Bunyip, but the Puddin' replied loudly--      'Politeness be sugared, politeness be hanged,    Politeness be jumbled and tumbled and banged.    It's simply a matter of putting on pace,    Politeness has nothing to do with the case.'    [Illustration]    'Always anxious to be eaten,' said Bill, 'that's this Puddin's mania.  Well, to oblige him, I ask you to join us at lunch.'    'Delighted, I'm sure,' said Bunyip, seating himself. 'There's nothing I  enjoy more than a good go in at steak-and-kidney pudding in the open  air.'    'Well said,' remarked Sam Sawnoff, patting him on the back. 'Hearty  eaters are always welcome.'    'You'll enjoy this Puddin',' said Bill, handing him a large slice. 'This  is a very rare Puddin'.'    'It's a cut-an'-come-again Puddin',' said Sam.    'It's a Christmas, steak, and apple-dumpling Puddin',' said Bill.    'It's a--Shall I tell him?' he asked, looking at Bill. Bill nodded, and  the Penguin leaned across to Bunyip Bluegum and said in a low voice,  'It's a Magic Puddin'.'    'No whispering,' shouted the Puddin' angrily. 'Speak up. Don't strain a  Puddin's ears at the meal table.'    'No harm intended, Albert,' said Sam, 'I was merely remarking how well  the crops are looking. Call him Albert when addressing him,' he added to  Bunyip Bluegum. 'It soothes him.'    'I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Albert,' said Bunyip.    'No soft soap from total strangers,' said the Puddin', rudely.    'Don't take no notice of him, mate,' said Bill. 'That's only his rough  and ready way. What this Puddin' requires is politeness and constant  eatin'.'    They had a delightful meal, eating as much as possible, for whenever  they stopped eating the Puddin' sang out--      'Eat away, chew away, munch and bolt and guzzle,    Never leave the table till you're full up to the muzzle.'    [Illustration]    But at length they had to stop, in spite of these encouraging remarks,  and, as they refused to eat any more, the Puddin' got out of his basin,  remarking--'If you won't eat any more here's giving you a run for the  sake of exercise', and he set off so swiftly on a pair of extremely thin  legs that Bill had to run like an antelope to catch him up.    'My word,' said Bill, when the Puddin' was brought"]]]
