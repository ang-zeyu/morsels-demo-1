[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2938"],[0,"Yeast (#1)"],[1,"By Thomas H. Huxley        I HAVE selected to-night the particular subject of Yeast for two  reasons--or, rather, I should say for three. In the first place, because  it is one of the simplest and the most familiar objects with which we  are acquainted. In the second place, because the facts and phenomena  which I have to describe are so simple that it is possible to put them  before you without the help of any of those pictures or diagrams which  are needed when matters are more complicated, and which, if I had to  refer to them here, would involve the necessity of my turning away from  you now and then, and thereby increasing very largely my difficulty  (already sufficiently great) in making myself heard. And thirdly, I have  chosen this subject because I know of no familiar substance forming part  of our every-day knowledge and experience, the examination of which,  with a little care, tends to open up such very considerable issues as  does this substance--yeast.    In the first place, I should like to call your attention to a fact with  which the whole of you are, to begin with, perfectly acquainted, I mean  the fact that any liquid containing sugar, any liquid which is formed by  pressing out the succulent parts of the fruits of plants, or a mixture  of honey and water, if left to itself for a short time, begins to  undergo a peculiar change. No matter how clear it might be at starting,  yet after a few hours, or at most a few days, if the temperature is  high, this liquid begins to be turbid, and by-and-by bubbles make their  appearance in it, and a sort of dirty-looking yellowish foam or scum  collects at the surface; while at the same time, by degrees, a similar  kind of matter, which we call the \"lees,\" sinks to the bottom.    The quantity of this dirty-looking stuff, that we call the scum and the  lees, goes on increasing until it reaches a certain amount, and then  it stops; and by the time it stops, you find the liquid in which this  matter has been formed has become altered in its quality. To begin with  it was a mere sweetish substance, having the flavour of whatever might  be the plant from which it was expressed, or having merely the taste and  the absence of smell of a solution of sugar; but by the time that this  change that I have been briefly describing to you is accomplished the  liquid has become completely altered, it has acquired a peculiar smell,  and, what is still more remarkable, it has gained the property of  intoxicating the person who drinks it. Nothing can be more innocent than  a solution of sugar; nothing can be less innocent, if taken in excess,  as you all know, than those fermented matters which are produced  from sugar. Well, again, if you notice that bubbling, or, as it were,  seething of the liquid, which has accompanied the whole of this process,  you will find that it is produced by the evolution of little bubbles of  air-like substance out of the liquid; and I dare say you all know this  air-like substance is not like common air; it is not a substance which  a man can breathe with impunity. You often hear of accidents which take  place in brewers' vats when men go in carelessly, and get suffocated  there without knowing that there was anything evil awaiting them. And if  you tried the experiment with this liquid I am telling of while it  was fermenting, you would find that any small animal let down into the  vessel would be similarly stifled; and you would discover that a light  lowered down into it would go out. Well, then, lastly, if after this  liquid has been thus altered you expose it to that process which is  called distillation; that is to say, if you put it into a still, and  collect the matters which are sent over, you obtain, when you first heat  it, a clear transparent liquid, which, however, is something totally  different from water; it is much lighter; it has a strong smell, and it  has an acrid taste; and it possesses the same intoxicating power as the  original liquid, but in a much more intense degree. If you put a light  to it, it burns with a bright flame, and it is that substance which we  know as spirits of wine.    Now these facts which I have just put before you--all but the last--have  been known from extremely remote antiquity. It is, I hope one of the  best evidences of the antiquity of the human race, that among the  earliest records of all kinds of men, you find a time recorded when they  got drunk. We may hope that that must have been a very late period in  their history. Not only have we the record of what happened to Noah, but  if we turn to the traditions of a different people, those forefathers  of ours who lived in the high lands of Northern India, we find that they  were not less addicted to intoxicating liquids; and I have no doubt  that the knowledge of this process extends far beyond the limits of  historically recorded time. And it is a very curious thing to observe  that all the names we have of this process, and all that belongs to  it, are names that have their roots not in our present language, but in  those older languages which go back to the times at which this country  was peopled. That word \"fermentation\" for example, which is the title  we apply to the whole process, is a Latin term; and a term which is  evidently based upon the fact of the effervescence of the liquid. Then  the French, who are very fond of calling themselves a Latin race, have a  particular word for ferment, which is 'levure'. And, in the same way, we  have the word \"leaven,\" those two words having reference to the heaving  up, or to the raising of the substance which is fermented. Now those are  words which we get from what I may call the Latin side of our parentage;  but if we turn to the Saxon side, there are a number of names connected  with this process of fermentation. For example, the Germans call  fermentation--and the old Germans did so--\"gahren;\" and they call  anything which is used as a ferment by such names, such as \"gheist\" and  \"geest,\" and finally in low German, \"yest\"; and that word you know is  the word our Saxon forefathers used, and is almost the same as the word  which is commonly employed in this country to denote the common ferment  of which I have been speaking. So they have another name, the word  \"hefe,\" which is derived from their verb \"heben,\" which signifies to  raise up; and they have yet a third name, which is also one common in  this country (I do not know whether it is common in Lancashire, but it  is certainly very common in the Midland countries), the word \"barm,\"  which is derived from a root which signifies to raise or to bear up.  Barm is a something borne up; and thus there is much more real relation  than is commonly supposed by those who make puns, between the beer which  a man takes down his throat and the bier upon which that process, if  carried to excess, generally lands him, for they are both derived  from the root signifying bearing up; the one thing is borne upon men's  shoulders, and the other is the fermented liquid which was borne up by  the fermentation taking place in itself.    Again, I spoke of the produce of fermentation as \"spirit of wine.\" Now  what a very curious phrase that is, if you come to think of it. The old  alchemists talked of the finest essence of anything as if it had the  same sort of relation to the thing itself as a man's spirit is supposed  to have to his body; and so they spoke of this fine essence of the  fermented liquid as being the spirit of the liquid. Thus came about  that extraordinary ambiguity of language, in virtue of which you apply  precisely the same substantive name to the soul of man and to a glass  of gin! And then there is still yet one other most curious piece of  nomenclature connected with this matter, and that is the word \"alcohol\"  itself, which is now so familiar to everybody. Alcohol originally meant  a very fine powder. The women of the Arabs and other Eastern people are  in the habit of tinging their eyelashes with a very fine black powder  which is made of antimony, and they call that \"kohol;\" and the \"al\" is  simply the article put in front of it, so as to say \"the kohol.\" And  up to the 17th century in this country the word alcohol was employed to  signify any very fine powder; you find it in Robert Boyle's works that  he uses \"alcohol\" for a very fine subtle powder. But then this name of  anything very fine and very subtle came to be specially connected with  the fine and subtle spirit obtained from the fermentation of sugar; and  I believe that the first person who fairly fixed it as the proper name  of what we now commonly call spirits of wine, was the great French  chemist Lavoisier, so comparatively recent is the use of the word  alcohol in this specialised sense.    So much by way of general introduction to the subject on which I have to  speak to-night. What I have hitherto stated is simply what we may call  common knowledge, which everybody may acquaint himself with. And  you know that what we call scientific knowledge is not any kind  of conjuration, as people sometimes suppose, but it is simply the  application of the same principles of common sense that we apply to  common knowledge, carried out, if I may so speak, to knowledge which is  uncommon. And all that we know now of this substance, yeast, and all the  very strange issues to which that knowledge has led us, have simply come  out of the inveterate habit, and a very fortunate habit for the human  race it is, which scientific men have of not being content until they  have routed out all the different chains and connections of apparently  simple phenomena, until they have taken them to pieces and understood  the conditions upon which they depend. I will try to point out to you  now what has happened in consequence of endeavouring to apply this  process of \"analysis,\" as we call it, this teazing out of an apparently  simple fact into all the little facts of which it is made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2939"],[0,"William Harvey and the Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood (#1)"],[1,"HARVEY AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD    By Thomas H. Huxley      [1]        I DESIRE this evening to give you some account of the life and labours  of a very noble Englishman--William Harvey.    William Harvey was born in the year 1578, and as he lived until the year  1657, he very nearly attained the age of 80. He was the son of a small  landowner in Kent, who was sufficiently wealthy to send this, his eldest  son, to the University of Cambridge; while he embarked the others in  mercantile pursuits, in which they all, as time passed on, attained  riches.    William Harvey, after pursuing his education at Cambridge, and taking  his degree there, thought it was advisable--and justly thought so, in  the then state of University education--to proceed to Italy, which  at that time was one of the great centres of intellectual activity in  Europe, as all friends of freedom hope it will become again, sooner or  later. In those days the University of Padua had a great renown;  and Harvey went there and studied under a man who was then very  famous--Fabricius of Aquapendente. On his return to England, Harvey  became a member of the College of Physicians in London, and entered into  practice; and, I suppose, as an indispensable step thereto, proceeded  to marry. He very soon became one of the most eminent members of the  profession in London; and, about the year 1616, he was elected by the  College of Physicians their Professor of Anatomy. It was while Harvey  held this office that he made public that great discovery of the  circulation of the blood and the movements of the heart, the nature of  which I shall endeavour by-and-by to explain to you at length. Shortly  afterwards, Charles the First having succeeded to the throne in 1625,  Harvey became one of the king's physicians; and it is much to the credit  of the unfortunate monarch--who, whatever his faults may have been,  was one of the few English monarchs who have shown a taste for art and  science--that Harvey became his attached and devoted friend as well  as servant; and that the king, on the other hand, did all he could to  advance Harvey's investigations. But, as you know, evil times came on;  and Harvey, after the fortunes of his royal master were broken,  being then a man of somewhat advanced years--over 60 years of age, in  fact--retired to the society of his brothers in and near London, and  among them pursued his studies until the day of his death. Harvey's  career is a life which offers no salient points of interest to the  biographer. It was a life devoted to study and investigation; and it  was a life the devotion of which was amply rewarded, as I shall have  occasion to point out to you, by its results.    Harvey, by the diversity, the variety, and the thoroughness of his  investigations, was enabled to give an entirely new direction to at  least two branches--and two of the most important branches--of what  now-a-days we call Biological Science. On the one hand, he founded  all our modern physiology by the discovery of the exact nature of the  motions of the heart, and of the course in which the blood is propelled  through the body; and, on the other, he laid the foundation of that  study of development which has been so much advanced of late years, and  which constitutes one of the great pillars of the doctrine of evolution.  This doctrine, I need hardly tell you, is now tending to revolutionise  our conceptions of the origin of living things, exactly in the same  way as Harvey's discovery of the circulation in the seventeeth century  revolutionised the conceptions which men had previously entertained with  regard to physiological processes.    It would, I regret, be quite impossible for me to attempt, in the course  of the time I can presume to hold you here, to unfold the history of  more than one of these great investigations of Harvey. I call them  \"great investigations,\" as distinguished from \"large publications.\" I  have in my hand a little book, which those of you who are at a great  distance may have some difficulty in seeing, and which I value very  much. It is, I am afraid, sadly thumbed and scratched with annotations  by a very humble successor and follower of Harvey. This little book is  the edition of 1651 of the 'Exercitationes de Generatione'; and if you  were to add another little book, printed in the same small type, and  about one-seventh of the thickness, you would have the sum total of the  printed matter which Harvey contributed to our literature. And yet  in that sum total was contained, I may say, the materials of two  revolutions in as many of the main branches of biological science. If  Harvey's published labours can be condensed into so small a compass, you  must recollect that it is not because he did not do a great deal more.  We know very well that he did accumulate a very considerable number of  observations on the most varied topics of medicine, surgery, and natural  history. But, as I mentioned to you just now, Harvey, for a time, took  the royal side in the domestic quarrel of the Great Rebellion, as it  is called; and the Parliament, not unnaturally resenting that action of  his, sent soldiers to seize his papers. And while I imagine they found  nothing treasonable among those papers, yet, in the process of rummaging  through them, they destroyed all the materials which Harvey had spent a  laborious life in accumulating; and hence it is that the man's work and  labours are represented by so little in apparent bulk.    What I chiefly propose to do to-night is to lay before you an account of  the nature of the discovery which Harvey made, and which is termed the  Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood. And I desire also, with  some particularity, to draw your attention to the methods by which that  discovery was achieved; for, in both these respects, I think, there will  be much matter for profitable reflection.    Let me point out to you, in the first place, with respect to this  important matter of the movements of the heart and the course of the  blood in the body, that there is a certain amount of knowledge  which must have been obtained without men taking the trouble to seek  it--knowledge which must have been taken in, in the course of time,  by everybody who followed the trade of a butcher, and still more so by  those people who, in ancient times, professed to divine the course of  future events from the entrails of animals. It is quite obvious to  all, from ordinary accidents, that the bodies of all the higher animals  contain a hot red fluid--the blood. Everybody can see upon the surface  of some part of the skin, underneath that skin, pulsating tubes, which  we know as the arteries. Everybody can see under the surface of the skin  more delicate and softer looking tubes, which do not pulsate, which are  of a bluish colour, and are termed the veins. And every person who has  seen a recently killed animal opened knows that these two kinds of tubes  to which I have just referred, are connected with an apparatus which  is placed in the chest, which apparatus, in recently killed animals,  is still pulsating. And you know that in yourselves you can feel the  pulsation of this organ, the heart, between the fifth and sixth ribs. I  take it that this much of anatomy and physiology has been known from the  oldest times, not only as a matter of curiosity, but because one of the  great objects of men, from their earliest recorded existence, has been  to kill one another, and it was a matter of considerable importance to  know which was the best place for hitting an enemy. I can refer you to  very ancient records for most precise and clear information that one of  the best places is to smite him between the fifth and sixth ribs. Now  that is a very good piece of regional anatomy, for that is the place  where the heart strikes in its pulsations, and the use of smiting there  is that you go straight to the heart. Well, all that must have been  known from time immemorial--at least for 4,000 or 5,000 years before the  commencement of our era--because we know that for as great a period as  that the Egyptians, at any rate, whatever may have been the case with  other people, were in the enjoyment of a highly developed civilisation.  But of what knowledge they may have possessed beyond this we know  nothing; and in tracing back the springs of the origin of everything  that we call \"modern science\" (which is not merely knowing, but knowing  systematically, and with the intention and endeavour to find out  the causal connection of things)--I say that when we trace back the  different lines of all the modern sciences we come at length to one  epoch and to one country--the epoch being about the fourth and fifth  centuries before Christ, and the country being ancient Greece. It is  there that we find the commencement and the root of every branch of  physical science and of scientific method. If we go back to that time  we have in the works attributed to Aristotle, who flourished between 300  and 400 years before Christ, a sort of encyclopaedia of the scientific  knowledge of that day--and a very marvellous collection of, in many  respects, accurate and precise knowledge it is. But, so far as regards  this particular topic, Aristotle, it must be confessed, has not got very  far beyond common knowledge. He knows a little about the structure of  the heart. I do not think that his knowledge is so inaccurate as many  people fancy, but it does not amount to much. A very few years after his  time, however, there was a Greek philosopher, Erasistratus, who lived  about three hundred years before Christ, and who must have pursued  anatomy with much care, for he made the important discovery that there  are membranous flaps, which are now called \"valves,\" at the origins  of the great vessels; and that there are certain other valves in the  interior of the heart itself.
