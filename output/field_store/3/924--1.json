Arrived at the entrance of the Gorge of Ollioulles, he halted on a  little eminence from which he could see all the surrounding country;  then either because he had reached the end of his journey, or because,  before attempting that forbidding, sombre pass which is called the  Thermopylae of Provence, he wished to enjoy the magnificent view which  spread to the southern horizon a little longer, he went and sat down on  the edge of the ditch which bordered the road, turning his back on the  mountains which rise like an amphitheatre to the north of the town, and  having at his feet a rich plain covered with tropical vegetation,  exotics of a conservatory, trees and flowers quite unknown in any other  part of France.    Beyond this plain, glittering in the last rays of the sun, pale and  motionless as a mirror lay the sea, and on the surface of the water  glided one brig-of-war, which, taking advantage of a fresh land breeze,  had all sails spread, and was bowling along rapidly, making for Italian  seas. The beggar followed it eagerly with his eyes until it disappeared  between the Cape of Gien and the first of the islands of Hyeres, then as  the white apparition vanished he sighed deeply, let his head fall into  his hands, and remained motionless and absorbed in his reflections until  the tramplings of a cavalcade made him start; he looked up, shook back  his long black hair, as if he wished to get rid of the gloomy thoughts  which were overwhelming him, and, looking at the entrance to the gorge  from whence the noise came, he soon saw two riders appear, who were no  doubt well known to him, for, drawing himself up to his full height, he  let fall the stick he was carrying, and folding his arms he turned  towards them. On their side the new-comers had hardly seen him before  they halted, and the foremost dismounted, threw his bridle to his  companion, and uncovering, though fifty paces from the man in rags,  advanced respectfully towards him. The beggar allowed him to approach  with an air of sombre dignity and without a single movement; then, when  he was quite near--    \"Well, marshal, have, you news for me?\" said the beggar.    \"Yes, sire,\" said the other sadly.    \"And what are they?\"    \"Such that I could wish it were anyone but myself to announce them to  your Majesty----\"    \"So the Emperor refuses my services! He forgets the victories of  Aboukir, Eylau, and Moscow?\"    \"No, sire; but he remembers the treaty of Naples, the taking of Reggio,  and the declaration of war of the viceroy of Italy.\"    The beggar struck his forehead.    \"Yes, yes! I daresay he thinks I deserve his reproaches, and yet it  seems to me that he ought to remember that there are two men in me--the  soldier whom he made his brother, and the brother whom he made a  king.... Yes, as brother I have treated him ill--very ill, but as king,  upon my soul, I could not have acted differently.... I had to choose  between my sword and my crown, and between a regiment and a people.  Listen, Brune: you do not know how it all happened. There was an English  fleet, the guns of which were growling in the port, there was a  Neapolitan population howling in the streets. If I had been alone, I  would have passed through the fleet with one boat, through the crowd  with my sword alone, but I had a wife and children. Yet I hesitated; the  idea of being called traitor and deserter caused me to shed more tears  than the loss of my throne, or perhaps the death of those I love best,  will ever wring from me.... And so he will have nothing more to do with  me? He refuses me as general, captain, private? Then what is left for me  to do?\"    \"Sire, your Majesty must leave France immediately.\"    \"And if I don't obey?\"    \"My orders are to arrest you and deliver you up to a court-martial!\"    \"Old comrade, you will not do that?\"    \"I shall do it, praying God to strike me dead in the moment I lay hands  on you!\"    \"That's you all over, Brune. You have been able to remain a good, loyal  fellow. He did not give you a kingdom, he did not encircle your brow  with a band of iron which men call a crown and which drives one mad; he  did not place you between your conscience and your family. So I must  leave France, begin my vagabond life again, and say farewell to Toulon,  which recalls so many memories to me! See, Brune,\" continued Murat,  leaning on the arm of the marshal, \"are not the pines yonder as fine as  any at the Villa Pamfili, the palms as imposing as any at Cairo, the  mountains as grand as any range in the Tyrol? Look to your left, is not  Cape Gien something like Castellamare and Sorrento--leaving out  Vesuvius? And see, Saint-Mandrier at the farthest point of the gulf, is  it not like my rock of Capri, which Lamarque juggled away so cleverly  from that idiot of a Sir Hudson Lowe? My God! and I must leave all this!  Is there no way of remaining on this little corner of French  ground--tell me, Brune!\"    \"You'll break my heart, sire!\" answered the marshal.    \"Well, we'll say no more about it. What news?\"    \"The Emperor has left Paris to join the army. They must be fighting  now.\"    \"Fighting now and I not there! Oh, I feel I could have been of use to  him on this battlefield. How I would have gloried in charging those  miserable Prussians and dastardly English! Brune, give me a passport,  I'll go at full speed, I'll reach the army, I will make myself known to  some colonel, I shall say, 'Give me your regiment.' I'll charge at its  head, and if the Emperor does not clasp my hand to-night, I'll blow my  brains out, I swear I will. Do what I ask, Brune, and however it may  end, my eternal gratitude will be yours!\"    \"I cannot, sire.\"    \"Well, well, say no more about it.\"    \"And your Majesty is going to leave France?\"    \"I don't know. Obey your orders, marshal, and if you come across me  again, have me arrested. That's another way of doing something for me.  Life is a heavy burden nowadays. He who will relieve me of it will be  welcome.... Good-bye, Brune.\"    He held out his hand to the marshal, who tried to kiss it; but Murat  opened his arms, the two old comrades held each other fast for a moment,  with swelling hearts and eyes full of tears; then at last they parted.  Brune remounted his horse, Murat picked up his stick again, and the two  men went away in opposite directions, one to meet his death by  assassination at Avignon, the other to be shot at Pizzo. Meanwhile, like  Richard III, Napoleon was bartering his crown against a horse at  Waterloo.    After the interview that has just been related, Murat took refuge with  his nephew, who was called Bonafoux, and who was captain of a frigate;  but this retreat could only be temporary, for the relationship would  inevitably awake the suspicions of the authorities. In consequence,  Bonafoux set about finding a more secret place of refuge for his uncle.  He hit on one of his friends, an avocat, a man famed for his integrity,  and that very evening Bonafoux went to see him.    After chatting on general subjects, he asked his friend if he had not a  house at the seaside, and receiving an affirmative answer, he invited  himself to breakfast there the next day; the proposal naturally enough  was agreed to with pleasure. The next day at the appointed hour Bonafoux  arrived at Bonette, which was the name of the country house where M.  Marouin's wife and daughter were staying. M. Marouin himself was kept by  his work at Toulon. After the ordinary greetings, Bonafoux stepped to  the window, beckoning to Marouin to rejoin him.    \"I thought,\" he said uneasily, \"that your house was by the sea.\"    \"We are hardly ten minutes' walk from it.\"    \"But it is not in sight.\"    \"That hill prevents you from seeing it.\"    \"May we go for a stroll on the beach before breakfast is served?\"    \"By all means. Well, your horse is still saddled. I will order mine--I  will come back for you.\"    Marouin went out. Bonafoux remained at the window, absorbed in his  thoughts. The ladies of the house, occupied in preparations for the  meal, did not observe, or did not appear to observe, his preoccupation.  In five minutes Marouin came back. He was ready to start. The avocat and  his friend mounted their horses and rode quickly down to the sea. On the  beach the captain slackened his pace, and riding along the shore for  about half an hour, he seemed to be examining the bearings of the coast  with great attention. Marouin followed without inquiring into his  investigations, which seemed natural enough for a naval officer.    After about an hour the two men went back to the house.    Marouin wished to have the horses unsaddled, but Bonafoux objected,  saying that he must go back to Toulon immediately after lunch. Indeed,  the coffee was hardly finished before he rose and took leave of his  hosts. Marouin, called back to town by his work, mounted his horse too,  and the two friends rode back to Toulon together. After riding along for  ten minutes, Bonafoux went close to his companion and touched him on the  thigh--    \"Marouin,\" he said, \"I have an important secret to confide to you.\"    \"Speak, captain. After a father confessor, you know there is no one so  discreet as a notary, and after a notary an avocat.\"    \"You can quite understand that I did not come to your country house just  for the pleasure of the ride. A more important object, a serious  responsibility, preoccupied me; I have chosen you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27558"],[0,"The 2003 CIA World Factbook (#1)"],[1,"CIA WORLD FACTBOOK 2003          CONTENTS      Countries and Locations    Field Listings    Rank Orders    Appendixes    Notes and Definitions    History of The World Factbook    Contributors and Copyright Information    Purchasing Information    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)        =====================================================================        What's New      - Country information has been updated as of 18 December 2003.    - For Rank Order pages and downloadable, tab-delimited rank-order  files, a Rank Order page for Highways has been added.    - Entries for Natural Gas - production, Natural Gas - consumption,  Natural Gas - exports, and Natural Gas - imports have been added  to the Economy category of each country.
