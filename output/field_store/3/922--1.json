The successful secession referendum held in  Montenegro in May of 2006 allowed it to legally leave its union  with Serbia the following month. These two Balkan countries have now  been formally recognized and are listed separately in the Factbook.    - In the Government category, the 'Capital' entry has been greatly  expanded and now contains up to four subfields, including significant  new information having to do with time. The subfields consist of the  name of the capital itself, its geographic coordinates, the time  difference at the capital from coordinated universal time (UTC), and,  if applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where  appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those  countries that have multiple time zones.    - The Transnational issues category now has a \"Trafficking in persons\"  entry. Human trafficking connotes modern-day slavery and this important  new field will include information on the most egregious countries  (Tier 2 Watch List and Tier 3) as listed in the US State Department's  annual report.    - A new Appendix G lists Weights and Measures. The appendix includes  information on mathematical notation and metric interrelationships,  as well as over 400 examples of standard conversion factors.    - Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the  2001 edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional maps  have also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name  spelling changes.        =====================================================================        The World Factbook (2006) - Country Listing      [Transcriber's note: To search on a country in this file, prefix the  country's name with \"@\", e.g. \"@Afghanistan\".  \"Afghanistan\" will find  all occurrences;

Indeed, why should we not  rather admire a Creative Power so infinite in its variety that it never  ceases to produce entirely different combinations with precisely the  same elements? The more one considers this prodigious versatility of  form, the more overwhelming it appears.    To begin with, each nation has its own distinct and characteristic type,  separating it from other races of men. Thus there are the English,  Spanish, German, or Slavonic types; again, in each nation we find  families distinguished from each other by less general but still  well-pronounced features; and lastly, the individuals of each family,  differing again in more or less marked gradations. What a multitude of  physiognomies! What variety of impression from the innumerable stamps of  the human countenance! What millions of models and no copies!  Considering this ever changing spectacle, which ought to inspire us with  most astonishment--the perpetual difference of faces or the accidental  resemblance of a few individuals? Is it impossible that in the whole  wide world there should be found by chance two people whose features are  cast in one and the same mould? Certainly not; therefore that which  ought to surprise us is not that these duplicates exist here and there  upon the earth, but that they are to be met with in the same place, and  appear together before our eyes, little accustomed to see such  resemblances. From Amphitryon down to our own days, many fables have  owed their origin to this fact, and history also has provided a few  examples, such as the false Demetrius in Russia, the English Perkin  Warbeck, and several other celebrated impostors, whilst the story we now  present to our readers is no less curious and strange.    On the 10th of, August 1557, an inauspicious day in the history of  France, the roar of cannon was still heard at six in the evening in the  plains of St. Quentin; where the French army had just been destroyed by  the united troops of England and Spain, commanded by the famous Captain  Emanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy. An utterly beaten infantry, the  Constable Montmorency and several generals taken prisoner, the Duke  d'Enghien mortally wounded, the flower of the nobility cut down like  grass,--such were the terrible results of a battle which plunged France  into mourning, and which would have been a blot on the reign of Henry  II, had not the Duke of Guise obtained a brilliant revenge the following  year.    In a little village less than a mile from the field of battle were to be  heard the groans of the wounded and dying, who had been carried thither  from the field of battle. The inhabitants had given up their houses to  be used as hospitals, and two or three barber surgeons went hither and  thither, hastily ordering operations which they left to their  assistants, and driving out fugitives who had contrived to accompany the  wounded under pretence of assisting friends or near relations. They had  already expelled a good number of these poor fellows, when, opening the  door of a small room, they found a soldier soaked in blood lying on a  rough mat, and another soldier apparently attending on him with the  utmost care.    \"Who are you?\" said one of the surgeons to the sufferer. \"I don't think  you belong to our French troops.\"    \"Help!\" cried the soldier, \"only help me! and may God bless you for it!\"    \"From the colour of that tunic,\" remarked the other surgeon, \"I should  wager the rascal belongs to some Spanish gentleman. By what blunder was  he brought here?\"    \"For pity's sake!\" murmured the poor fellow, \"I am in such pain.\"    \"Die, wretch!\" responded the last speaker, pushing him with his foot.  \"Die, like the dog you are!\"    But this brutality, answered as it was by an agonised groan, disgusted  the other surgeon.    \"After all, he is a man, and a wounded man who implores help. Leave him  to me, Rene.\"    Rene went out grumbling, and the one who remained proceeded to examine  the wound. A terrible arquebus-shot had passed through the leg,  shattering the bone: amputation was absolutely necessary.    Before proceeding to the operation, the surgeon turned to the other  soldier, who had retired into the darkest corner of the room.    \"And you, who may you be?\" he asked.    The man replied by coming forward into the light: no other answer was  needed. He resembled his companion so closely that no one could doubt  they were brothers-twin brothers, probably. Both were above middle  height; both had olive-brown complexions, black eyes, hooked noses,  pointed chins, a slightly projecting lower lip; both were  round-shouldered, though this defect did not amount to disfigurement:  the whole personality suggested strength, and was not destitute of  masculine beauty. So strong a likeness is hardly ever seen; even their  ages appeared to agree, for one would not have supposed either to be  more than thirty-two; and the only difference noticeable, besides the  pale countenance of the wounded man, was that he was thin as compared  with the moderate fleshiness of the other, also that he had a large scar  over the right eyebrow.    \"Look well after your brother's soul,\" said the surgeon to the soldier,  who remained standing; \"if it is in no better case than his body, it is  much to be pitied.\"    \"Is there no hope?\" inquired the Sosia of the wounded man.    \"The wound is too large and too deep,\" replied the man of science, \"to  be cauterised with boiling oil, according to the ancient method.  'Delenda est causa mali,' the source of evil must be destroyed, as says  the learned Ambrose Pare; I ought therefore 'secareferro,'--that is to  say, take off the leg. May God grant that he survive the operation!\"    While seeking his instruments, he looked the supposed brother full in  the face, and added--    \"But how is it that you are carrying muskets in opposing armies, for I  see that you belong to us, while this poor fellow wears Spanish  uniform?\"    \"Oh, that would be a long story to tell,\" replied the soldier, shaking  his head. \"As for me, I followed the career which was open to me, and  took service of my own free will under the banner of our lord king,  Henry II. This man, whom you rightly suppose to be my brother, was born  in Biscay, and became attached to the household of the Cardinal of  Burgos, and afterwards to the cardinal's brother, whom he was obliged to  follow to the war. I recognised him on the battle-field just as he fell;  I dragged him out of a heap of dead, and brought him here.\"    During his recital this individual's features betrayed considerable  agitation, but the surgeon did not heed it. Not finding some necessary  instruments, \"My colleague,\" he exclaimed, \"must have carried them off.  He constantly does this, out of jealousy of my reputation; but I will be  even with him yet! Such splendid instruments! They will almost work of  themselves, and are capable of imparting some skill even to him, dunce  as he is!... I shall be back in an hour or two; he must rest, sleep,  have nothing to excite him, nothing to inflame the wound; and when the  operation is well over, we shall see! May the Lord be gracious to him!\"    Then he went to the door, leaving the poor wretch to the care of his  supposed brother.    \"My God!\" he added, shaking his head, \"if he survive, it will be by the  help of a miracle.\"    Scarcely had he left the room, when the unwounded soldier carefully  examined the features of the wounded one.    \"Yes,\" he murmured between his teeth, \"they were right in saying that my  exact double was to be found in the hostile army . . . . Truly one would  not know us apart! . . . I might be surveying myself in a mirror. I did  well to look for him in the rear of the Spanish army, and, thanks to the  fellow who rolled him over so conveniently with that arquebus-shot; I  was able to escape the dangers of the melee by carrying him out of it.\"    \"But that's not all,\" he thought, still carefully studying the tortured  face of the unhappy sufferer; \"it is not enough to have got out of that.  I have absolutely nothing in the world, no home, no resources. Beggar by  birth, adventurer by fortune, I have enlisted, and have consumed my pay;  I hoped for plunder, and here we are in full flight! What am I to do? Go  and drown myself? No, certainly a cannon-ball would be as good as that.  But can't I profit by this chance, and obtain a decent position by  turning to my own advantage this curious resemblance, and making some  use of this man whom Fate has thrown in my way, and who has but a short  time to live?\"    Arguing thus, he bent over the prostrate man with a cynical laugh: one  might have thought he was Satan watching the departure of a soul too  utterly lost to escape him.    \"Alas! alas!\" cried the sufferer; \"may God have mercy on me! I feel my  end is near.\"    \"Bah! comrade, drive away these dismal thoughts. Your leg pains  you--well they will cut it off! Think only of the other one, and trust  in Providence!\"    \"Water, a drop of water, for Heaven's sake!\" The sufferer was in a high  fever. The would-be nurse looked round and saw a jug of water, towards  which the dying man extended a trembling hand. A truly infernal idea  entered his mind. He poured some water into a gourd which hung from his  belt, held it to the lips of the wounded man, and then withdrew it.    \"Oh! I thirst-that water! . . . For pity's sake, give me some!\"    \"Yes, but on one condition you must tell me your whole history.\"    \"Yes . . ."]]]
