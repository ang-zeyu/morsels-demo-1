The Book of Beasts      He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all  the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up--but then the  news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front  door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man  come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted  since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the  gas bracket.    And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, \"Master Lionel, dear,  they've come to fetch you to go and be King.\"    Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands  and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept  wriggling and fidgeting and saying, \"Oh, don't, Nurse,\" and, \"I'm sure  my ears are quite clean,\" or, \"Never mind my hair, it's all right,\" and,  \"That'll do.\"    \"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,\"  said Nurse.    The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting  for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very  grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with  velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very  expensive jam tarts.    They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: \"Sire, your  great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is  dead, and now you have got to come and be King.\"    \"Yes, please, sir,\" said Lionel, \"when does it begin?\"    \"You will be crowned this afternoon,\" said the grave gentleman who was  not quite so grave-looking as the other.    \"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be  fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace  collar?\" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea.    \"Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about  changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up.\"    The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses,  which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No.  7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up.    Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:  \"Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear.  No--there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse.\"    \"Good-bye, ducky,\" said Nurse. \"Be a good little King now, and say  'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little  girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything.\"    So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King  any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him--so new that he  had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he  had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his  tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had  been building with bricks in the nursery; and now--the streets were all  fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving  handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers  everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches  were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their  ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, \"Long live Lionel! Long  live our little King!\"    He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes,  but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would  very likely have bothered about it the whole time.    As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the  Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand.    \"I thought we were a Republic,\" said Lionel. \"I'm sure there hasn't been  a King for some time.\"    \"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened  when my grandfather was a little boy,\" said the Prime Minister, \"and  since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown--so  much a week, you know, according to people's means--sixpence a week from  those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from  those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be  paid for by the people.\"    \"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?\"    \"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had  had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a  strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults--he was fond  of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be  tinned--and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill.\"    Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage  stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being  crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time  it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and  had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he  was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery.    Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam  and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and  blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked.    After tea Lionel said: \"I think I should like a book. Will you get me  one, Nurse?\"    \"Bless the child,\" said Nurse. \"You don't suppose you've lost the use of  your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books  yourself.\"    So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the  Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and  were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming  bothering for now--when Lionel cried out: \"Oh, what a worldful of books!  Are they yours?\"    \"They are yours, Your Majesty,\" answered the Chancellor. \"They were the  property of the late King, your great-great--\"    \"Yes, I know,\" Lionel interrupted. \"Well, I shall read them all. I love  to read. I am so glad I learned to read.\"    \"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,\" said the Prime Minister, \"I  should not read these books. Your great--\"    \"Yes?\" said Lionel, quickly.    \"He was a very good King--oh, yes, really a very superior King in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23666"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 3 (#1)"],[1,"FURNITURE  HOW TO MAKE IT    PART THREE          POPULAR MECHANICS HANDBOOKS        CHICAGO  POPULAR MECHANICS COMPANY    Copyrighted, 1912    BY H. H. WINDSOR    This book is one of the series of handbooks on industrial subjects being  published by the Popular Mechanics Co.

The finish was applied in the following  manner: First, all the parts were well scraped and sandpapered, then the  surface was covered with a coating of boiled linseed oil. After this had  stood several hours, or until it had had time to penetrate the wood, the  surplus liquid was wiped off with a flannel cloth. After the oil had  stood for 48 hours, a thin coat of shellac was applied and allowed to  harden overnight. The next morning this shellac was sandpapered lightly  with No. 00 paper and a coat of floor wax was applied according to the  directions which are found upon every can. Two more coats of wax were  applied after intervals of half an hour and the finish was completed.  The effect is very pleasing. The oil brings out the rich color of the  wood and the shellac and wax serve to preserve the color. The following  stock is needed:      1 top, 1 by 16-1/2 by 40-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 20 in., S-4-S.    2 rails, 7/8 by 4-1/4 by 36 in., S-2-S.    2 rails, 7/8 by 4-1/4 by 13 in., S-2-S.    2 lower rails, 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 13 in., S-2-S.    1 stretcher, 7/8 by 3-3/4 by 36 in., S-2-S.    6 slats, 3/8 by 1-1/4 by 11 in., S-2-S.    With the exception of the legs all the stock is specified mill-planed to  thickness upon two surfaces. The legs are specified planed on four  sides. Square the legs to length and the rails, stretcher, slats, etc.,  to width and length.    [Illustration: Detail of the Piano Bench]    Lay out and work the tenons of the rails and stretcher. The slats are  best made without tenons, the whole end of each slat being \"housed\" into  the rails. The reason for this is obvious--it is a difficult matter to  fit two or more pieces between fixed parts when their ends are tenoned.  When the ends are housed any slight variation in the lengths adjusts  itself. It is necessary, however, to chisel the sides of the mortises  carefully, but this is a simple matter compared with getting the  shoulders of the tenons, etc., all just alike.    Assemble the parts, using good hot glue. Put the ends of the bench  together first. When the glue has hardened on these, place the stretcher  and side rails. Fasten the top to the frame from the under side, either  by glued blocks and screws or by angle irons.          A LIBRARY TABLE      A library table of neat appearance and correct proportions is shown in  the accompanying sketch and detail drawing. This table looks best when  finished in quarter-sawed oak, although any of the other furniture woods  can be used if desired. If the material is ordered from the mill cut to  length, squared and sanded, much of the hard labor can be avoided. Order  the following pieces:      4 legs, 2 by 2 by 30-1/4 in., S-4-S.    1 top, 1-1/8 by 30 by 42 in., S-4-S.    2 end pieces, 3/4 by 17-1/8 by 29 in., S-2-S.    2 top rails, 7/8 by 2 by 37 in., S-4-S.    2 top rails, 7/8 by 2 by 25-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 lower brace, 3/4 by 2 by 32 in., S-4-S.    4 shelves, 3/4 by 7 by 29 in., S-4-S.    8 slats, 1/4 by 1-1/8 by 17-1/8 in., S-4-S.    2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 5-3/4 by 25 in., S-4-S.    4 drawer sides, 3/8 by 3-3/4 by 14 in., soft wood.    2 drawer ends, 3/8 by 3-3/8 by 24-1/4 in., soft wood.    2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 13-1/4 by 24-1/4 in., soft wood.    2 drawer supports, 3/4 by 2 by 23-1/2 in., soft wood.    2 drawer supports, 3/4 by 2 by 25 in., soft wood.      [Illustration: Detail of the Library Table]    Start work on the legs by beveling the tops and squaring them up and  laying out the mortises for the shelves as shown in section BB. Care  should be taken to get the legs mortised in pairs and all cut the same  height. This is best done by placing the four legs side by side with the  ends square, and then laying out the mortises across all four at once  with a try-square.    [Illustration: The Finished Library Table]    The table top is made of several boards which are doweled and glued  together. Be careful to get the best side of each board up and have the  joints a tight fit. The corners should be cut out for the posts as  shown. The posts are to be fastened to the board by means of screws. The  holes can be counterbored for the heads and then plugged. The top rails  are also fastened to the top board by means of screws.    The end pieces can now be made. Two or more boards will have to be  glued together for these. The top corners will have to be cut to fit  about the top rails. Cleats can be used in fastening them to the top  board. The shelves also have the corners cut to fit into the mortises in  the posts. They are held to the end boards by means of screws.    If the parts all fit perfectly square and tight, they can be glued and  screwed together, which will complete the table except for the slats and  drawers. The slats can be fastened on with nails, then the heads covered  with fancy nails which can be secured for this purpose. The drawer  supports can now be put in. They are screwed to the end boards as shown.  A bottom brace should be fastened under the lower shelves to help steady  the table. The two drawers are made as shown in the detail sketch. No  handles are needed as the lower edge of the front board can be used for  pulling them out.    When the table is complete it should be carefully gone over with fine  sandpaper and all rough spots removed. Scrape the glue from about the  joints as finish will not take where there is any glue. Apply the stain  preferred or the one that matches the other furniture. This can be any  of the many stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.
