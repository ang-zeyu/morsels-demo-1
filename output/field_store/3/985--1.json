PREFACE.      The Editors of _The Standard_ have kindly permitted me to republish the  contents of this book, and I tender them my thanks.    The original form of these Studies of animal life has been extensively  altered, and, in some instances, the titles have been changed.    I am again greatly indebted to my brother, R. Wilkins Rees. His wide and  accurate knowledge has been constantly at my disposal, and in the  preparation of these Studies he has given me much indispensable advice  and assistance.    Similarity in the habits of some of the animals described has made a  slight similarity of treatment unavoidable in certain chapters.    I may also remark that, in unfrequented districts where beasts and birds  of prey are not destroyed by gamekeepers, the hare is as much a creature  of the night as is the badger or the fox.

It is an attempt to say to the general public a few  things about this amazing work of Dr. J. R. Brinkley, of Milford,  Kansas, which he is debarred from saying for himself in this simple  form. He has under consideration a book of his own covering the subject  of Goat-Gland Transplantation, his experiments, successes, failures,  theories, and conclusions, which will probably be issued during the  winter of 1922, and in that book he expects to treat his subject  exhaustively with full medical and surgical detail, in a manner  acceptable to the medical profession. But, in the meantime, no  satisfactory effort has been made to tell the story to the general  public, except in the fragmentary form of occasional newspaper notices.  The author feels that the chief interest in this matter abides with the  patient rather than with the practitioner, or, if not the chief  interest, at least an equal interest. It seems proper, therefore, that  the subject should be briefly dealt with at this time, while it is yet  in its infancy, in such a manner that the general public may grasp the  essentials of what is being done in America in this new application of  endocrinology. Some attention is paid to the pioneer work of Dr. Frank  Lydston of Chicago in the transplanting of human glands into human  beings, but rather by way of emphasizing the fact that Dr. Brinkley,  with the choice of human, monkey, goat, or sheep glands before him,  chose the goat-glands in preference to any other for his field of  experiment and operation, and has never for a moment regretted his  choice, or seen any reason to alter it.    Without any wish to enter upon a controversy, the author is impelled to  take some notice of the statement of Dr. Serge Voronoff of Paris, who,  during his recent visit to the United States, announced that he pinned  his faith almost exclusively to the glands of the anthropoid apes as  most suitable for transplantation into human beings, while he lamented  the natural scarcity of obtainable material. Dr. Voronoff is credited  with having performed over 150 transplantations upon rams, but none  whatever of goat-glands upon human beings, and not more than two or  three of simian glands upon human beings. His statement, therefore, that  successful transplantation of the glands of the goat into a human being  is \"impossible, and cannot succeed,\" is empirical, and entirely  unsupported by any experience of his own in the matter. Against it, and  completely confuting it, we set the clear conclusions of Dr. Brinkley,  backed by his unequalled record of over 600 successful transplants of  goat-glands into men and women, during the past three years. Since there  is no other human being who has had experience sufficient in this matter  upon which he may justly found an opinion, it seems to the author that  only one man, Dr. Brinkley himself, is qualified to speak at all, and  until members of the medical profession here and in Europe have mastered  Dr. Brinkley's technique, and learned what to do, and how and why, and  what not to do, and why not, a dogmatic negative is not the proper  comment with regard to the question of whether successful  transplantation of goat-glands can be made upon human beings. If, after  learning what Dr. Brinkley has learned by laborious experiments,  continued for years, they find that their conclusions differ from his,  they will at least have earned the right to speak. But it is  unreasonable to suppose, in that event, that their conclusions would in  any way or degree differ from Dr. Brinkley's conclusion that, in brief,  the implanting of the glands of the young goat into men and women is an  actual triumph of modern surgery and medical skill, which has resulted,  in hundreds of cases, clearly recorded, and filed for reference, in  rejuvenating both men and women; removing impotence from old men; curing  arterio-sclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, in every case treated;  curing five cases of Dementia Praecox out of a total of five cases  treated; curing six cases of Locomotor Ataxia out of six cases treated;  curing two cases of Paralysis Agitans out of two cases treated;  restoring normal conditions in one hundred cases of Psychopathia  Sexualis; bringing about the parenthood of barren women and impotent men  not yet past middle-age; restoring the function of menstruation or  regular periodicity to women who have passed through the change of life;  and, in a word, making good in the cure of so-called incurables, and  doing something that was never done before, to our knowledge, in the  history of the earth.    It is not the intention in this little book to follow Dr. Brinkley in  exact detail through his amazing list of cases of all manner of diseases  cured by this treatment. His files are open to the profession at all  times, and the records may be consulted by the earnest investigator at  the hospital at Milford, Kansas.    The intention in this little book is to cover particularly that phase of  human longing which asks that the clock be turned back, and that old age  be deferred.    It is a fact beyond all gainsaying that Dr. Brinkley's operation has in  truth cheated old age of its toll in very many cases of both sexes, and  the improvement, or rejuvenation, affects both the minds and bodies of  those treated by this method; and this rejuvenation is lasting to the  extent of the doctor's observation. It would be presuming to say that it  is a permanent improvement. Upon that point no one has any right to  offer an opinion, because there are no facts upon which to found it. But  Dr. Brinkley's earliest cases, operated upon three years ago, up to the  present time have shown no diminution whatever in the good effects  secured. Neither the women nor the men have lost any particle of their  increased vitality during this lapse of time. Who can say how long the  good effects will continue? Dr. Brinkley's opinion is that the  improvement will run for possibly fifteen years, at the end of which  time he expects to re-operate upon any cases that show a slowing-down in  the life-processes, and believes that the introduction of two new glands  after that time will result in a return of the vitality in full force as  before. That is his guess of the probable duration of the improvement,  but it is quite possible that his estimate errs on the side of  conservatism. There is one assuring and comforting fact, however,  bearing on this point, which should be carefully noted here, namely,  when a retransplantation was made by Dr. Brinkley upon a goat which had  first been cured of old age by transplantation of new glands, which was  allowed to retain this new adolescence for a year, and was then deprived  of the glands, causing a speedy return to the miserable condition of old  age and its ills, and which was then re-operated upon and given two new  glands, the instant improvement was every whit as noticeable and as  perfect in this second implantation as in the first. Now it is a  reasonable inference from this clear-cut result that Dr. Brinkley is  right in his opinion that a second transplantation of the goat-glands  into a human being after a lapse of years, when the first implant may be  expected to have worn itself thin, will result in the same improvement  in the physical and mental condition of either man or woman as took  place upon the first implant. This is, in fact, the basis of his theory  that the normal age of man and woman today can be surely extended from  the three score and ten limit to possibly twice that number of years.  You are invited to consider what this discovery of Dr. Brinkley's  operation, for it is no less than a discovery, would have meant to the  world in the prolongation of the lives of those benefactors in all  fields of human endeavor, Literature, Science, Art, etc., if it had been  known and understood when Shakespeare wrote, when Darwin worked, when  Rubens painted, and when Patti sang.
