THE AUTHOR.          PREFACE TO SIXTH EDITION.      The cordial reception given to this little book by the medical  profession, by educators, and especially by the young men of the  country, have by their demands for the book necessitated the  appearance of new editions in such rapid succession that no  far-reaching changes in the text have been possible even if they had  been needed. Happily, no extensive changes have been required.    In the second edition several corrections, typographical and verbal,  were made and additions made to the appendix. To the third edition the  chapter on Development was added. The fourth and fifth editions  received verbal changes here and added paragraphs there.    The sixth edition differs from the fifth in the addition of the  author's portrait as a frontispiece, the addition of an answered  question to the appendix and the listing of certain lecture topics,  with press notices and letters.    The book seems to be meeting a demand for accurate information briefly  and clearly stated.                                                     THE AUTHOR.    Chicago, November 1, 1908.          FOREWORD.      Several years ago the author was asked by his students to present to  them some of the facts of Sexual Physiology and Hygiene. The plea of  \"not a specialist in that line\" was not accepted; so after a few weeks  devoted to a careful study of the literature the subject was  presented. It seemed to be acceptable, and other invitations followed  in successive years not only from the author's own institution but  from many others.    In the last few years the subject has been presented at all of the  leading institutions of learning in the middle west--at some of them  several times and always to large audiences.    In response to repeated requests for \"a book\" the author has finally  prepared this brief volume in which he has endeavored to present a  difficult subject in the true university spirit, frankly calling  things by their right names, always keeping in close accord with the  latest researches.    It is hoped that the chapter on Hygiene will in itself be a  justification for the book.                                               WINFIELD S.

The dazzling blue of sea  and sky which characterises a tropical noonday has become subdued and  already roseate tints are beginning to prepare the glory of the sunset  hour. A lizard crawls lazily up the whitewashed wall. The song of the  _sabia_, that wonderful Brazilian thrush, sounds from the royal palm  tree. The air is heavy with the perfume of the orange blossom. There  is no long twilight in the tropics. Night will leap down suddenly upon  my Brazilian garden from out of the glory of the sunset sky.    Theresa, the _ama_, stands before us on the terrace under the mango  trees, and we, her _yayazinhas_ and _yoyozinhos_, know that the story  hour has come. Theresa, daughter of the mud huts under the palm trees,  _ama_ in the _sobrado_ of the foreign _senhora_, is a royal queen of  story land. For her the beasts break silence and talk like humans. For  her all the magic wonders of her tales stand forth as living truth.  Her lithe body sways backwards and forwards to the rhythm of her words  as she unfolds her tales to us. She is a picture to remember as she  stands under the mango trees on our terrace. Her spotless white  \"_camiza_\" is decorated with beautiful pillow lace, her own handiwork.  Her skirt of stiffly starched cotton is red and purple in colour. A  crimson flowered folded shawl hangs over her right shoulder and great  strings of beads ornament the ebony of her neck and arms. To sit at  the feet of Theresa, the _ama_, is to enter the gate of story land.          CONTENTS             PREFACE    I.     HOW NIGHT CAME    II.    HOW THE RABBIT LOST HIS TAIL    III.

HOW THE BRAZILIAN BEETLES GOT THEIR GORGEOUS COATS          I    How Night Came      Years and years ago at the very beginning of time, when the world had  just been made, there was no night. It was day all the time. No one  had ever heard of sunrise or sunset, starlight or moonbeams. There  were no night birds, nor night beasts, nor night flowers. There were  no lengthening shadows, nor soft night air, heavy with perfume.    In those days the daughter of the GREAT SEA SERPENT, who dwelt in the  depths of the seas, married one of the sons of the great earth race  known as MAN. She left her home among the shades of the deep seas and  came to dwell with her husband in the land of daylight. Her eyes grew  weary of the bright sunlight and her beauty faded. Her husband watched  her with sad eyes, but he did not know what to do to help her.    \"O, if night would only come,\" she moaned as she tossed about wearily  on her couch. \"Here it is always day, but in my father's kingdom there  are many shadows. O, for a little of the darkness of night!\"    Her husband listened to her moanings. \"What is night?\" he asked her.  \"Tell me about it and perhaps I can get a little of it for you.\"    \"Night,\" said the daughter of the GREAT SEA SERPENT, \"is the name we  give to the heavy shadows which darken my father's kingdom in the  depths of the seas. I love the sunlight of your earth land, but I grow  very weary of it. If we could have only a little of the darkness of my  father's kingdom to rest our eyes part of the time.\"    Her husband at once called his three most faithful slaves. \"I am about  to send you on a journey,\" he told them. \"You are to go to the kingdom  of the GREAT SEA SERPENT who dwells in the depths of the seas and ask  him to give you some of the darkness of night that his daughter may  not die here amid the sunlight of our earth land.\"    The three slaves set forth for the kingdom of the GREAT SEA SERPENT.  After a long dangerous journey they arrived at his home in the depths  of the seas and asked him to give them some of the shadows of night  to carry back to the earth land. The GREAT SEA SERPENT gave them a big  bag full at once. It was securely fastened and the GREAT SEA SERPENT  warned them not to open it until they were once more in the presence  of his daughter, their mistress.    The three slaves started out, bearing the big bag full of night upon  their heads. Soon they heard strange sounds within the bag. It was the  sound of the voices of all the night beasts, all the night birds, and  all the night insects. If you have ever heard the night chorus from  the jungles on the banks of the rivers you will know how it sounded.  The three slaves had never heard sounds like those in all their lives.  They were terribly frightened.    \"Let us drop the bag full of night right here where we are and run  away as fast as we can,\" said the first slave.    \"We shall perish. We shall perish, anyway, whatever we do,\" cried the  second slave.    \"Whether we perish or not I am going to open the bag and see what  makes all those terrible sounds,\" said the third slave.    Accordingly they laid the bag on the ground and opened it. Out rushed  all the night beasts and all the night birds and all the night insects  and out rushed the great black cloud of night. The slaves were more  frightened than ever at the darkness and escaped to the jungle.    The daughter of the GREAT SEA SERPENT was waiting anxiously for the  return of the slaves with the bag full of night. Ever since they had  started out on their journey she had looked for their return, shading  her eyes with her hand and gazing away off at the horizon, hoping with  all her heart that they would hasten to bring the night. In that  position she was standing under a royal palm tree, when the three  slaves opened the bag and let night escape. \"Night comes. Night comes  at last,\" she cried, as she saw the clouds of night upon the horizon.  Then she closed her eyes and went to sleep there under the royal palm  tree.    When she awoke she felt greatly refreshed. She was once more the happy  princess who had left her father's kingdom in the depths of the great  seas to come to the earth land. She was now ready to see the day  again. She looked up at the bright star shining above the royal palm  tree and said, \"O, bright beautiful star, henceforth you shall be  called the morning star and you shall herald the approach of day. You  shall reign queen of the sky at this hour.\"    Then she called all the birds about her and said to them, \"O,  wonderful, sweet singing birds, henceforth I command you to sing your  sweetest songs at this hour to herald the approach of day.\" The cock  was standing by her side. \"You,\" she said to him, \"shall be appointed  the watchman of the night. Your voice shall mark the watches of the  night and shall warn the others that the _madrugada_ comes.\" To this  very day in Brazil we call the early morning the _madrugada_. The cock  announces its approach to the waiting birds. The birds sing their  sweetest songs at that hour and the morning star reigns in the sky as  queen of the _madrugada_.    When it was daylight again the three slaves crept home through the  forests and jungles with their empty bag.    \"O, faithless slaves,\" said their master, \"why did you not obey the  voice of the GREAT SEA SERPENT and open the bag only in the presence  of his daughter, your mistress? Because of your disobedience I shall  change you into monkeys. Henceforth you shall live in the trees. Your  lips shall always bear the mark of the sealing wax which sealed the  bag full of night.\"    To this very day one sees the mark upon the monkeys' lips, where they  bit off the wax which sealed the bag; and in Brazil night leaps out  quickly upon the earth just as it leapt quickly out of the bag in  those days at the beginning of time. And all the night beasts and  night birds and night insects give a sunset chorus in the jungles at  nightfall.          II    How the Rabbit Lost His Tail      Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, the rabbit had a long tail, but  the cat had none. She looked with envious eyes at the one which the  rabbit had. It was exactly the sort of a tail she longed to have.    The rabbit was always a thoughtless careless little beast. One day he  went to sleep with his beautiful long tail hanging straight out behind  him. Along came Mistress Puss carrying a sharp knife, and with one  blow she cut off Mr. Rabbit's tail. Mistress Puss was very spry and  she had the tail nearly sewed on to her own body before Mr. Rabbit  saw what she was doing.    \"Don't you think"]]]
