This is the hour of pride and power,          Talon and tush and claw.       Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all          That keep the Jungle Law!       Night-Song in the Jungle    It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when  Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and  spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling  in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her  four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the  cave where they all lived. \"Augrh!\" said Father Wolf. \"It is time to  hunt again.\" He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with  a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: \"Good luck go with you, O  Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble  children that they may never forget the hungry in this world.\"    It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India  despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling  tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village  rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more  than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets  that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting  everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui  goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake  a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the  madness--and run.    \"Enter, then, and look,\" said Father Wolf stiffly, \"but there is no food  here.\"    \"For a wolf, no,\" said Tabaqui, \"but for so mean a person as myself a  dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people],  to pick and choose?\" He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he  found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end  merrily.    \"All thanks for this good meal,\" he said, licking his lips. \"How  beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young  too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings  are men from the beginning.\"    Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so  unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see  Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.    Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then  he said spitefully:    \"Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt  among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.\"    Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty  miles away.    \"He has no right!\" Father Wolf began angrily--\"By the Law of the Jungle  he has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will  frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for  two, these days.\"    \"His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,\" said  Mother Wolf quietly. \"He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That  is why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are  angry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry.  They will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our  children must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very  grateful to Shere Khan!\"    \"Shall I tell him of your gratitude?\" said Tabaqui.    \"Out!\" snapped Father Wolf. \"Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast  done harm enough for one night.\"    \"I go,\" said Tabaqui quietly. \"Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the  thickets. I might have saved myself the message.\"    Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little  river he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has  caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.    \"The fool!\" said Father Wolf. \"To begin a night's work with that noise!  Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?\"    \"H'sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,\" said Mother  Wolf. \"It is Man.\"    The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come  from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders  woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run  sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.    \"Man!\" said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. \"Faugh! Are there  not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on  our ground too!\"    The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason,  forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his  children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds  of his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing  means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with  guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.  Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among  themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living  things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is  true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.    The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated \"Aaarh!\" of the  tiger's charge.    Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. \"He has  missed,\" said Mother Wolf. \"What is it?\"    Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and  mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub.    \"The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter's campfire,  and has burned his feet,\" said Father Wolf with a grunt. \"Tabaqui is  with him.\"    \"Something is coming uphill,\" said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. \"Get  ready.\"    The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped  with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had been  watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the  wolf checked in mid-spring. He made his bound before he saw what it was  he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was  that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing  almost where he left ground.    \"Man!\" he snapped. \"A man's cub. Look!\"    Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked  brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom  as ever came to a wolf's cave at night. He looked up into Father Wolf's  face, and laughed.    \"Is that a man's cub?\" said Mother Wolf. \"I have never seen one. Bring  it here.\"    A Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg  without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right on the  child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down  among the cubs.    \"How little! How naked, and--how bold!\" said Mother Wolf softly. The  baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide.  \"Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man's  cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man's cub among  her children?\"    \"I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in  my time,\" said Father Wolf. \"He is altogether without hair, and I  could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not  afraid.\"    The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan's  great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui,  behind him, was squeaking: \"My lord, my lord, it went in here!\"    \"Shere Khan does us great honor,\" said Father Wolf, but his eyes were  very angry. \"What does Shere Khan need?\"    \"My quarry. A man's cub went this way,\" said Shere Khan. \"Its parents  have run off. Give it to me.\"    Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter's campfire, as Father Wolf had  said, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father Wolf  knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in  by. Even where he was, Shere Khan's shoulders and forepaws were cramped  for want of room, as a man's would be if he tried to fight in a barrel.    \"The Wolves are a free people,\" said Father Wolf. \"They take orders from  the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man's  cub is ours--to kill if we choose.\"    \"Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the  bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog's den for my fair  dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!\"    The tiger's roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself  clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in  the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.    \"And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The man's cub is mine,  Lungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with  the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of  little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee! Now get  hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved cattle), back  thou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever  thou camest into the world! Go!\"    Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he  won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in  the Pack and was not called"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net            Transcriber's note: A few typographical errors have been corrected: they  are listed at the end of the text.           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: GUARDIAN ANGEL]           *       *       *       *       *      SEARCHLIGHTS ON HEALTH    LIGHT ON DARK CORNERS           *       *       *       *       *    A COMPLETE SEXUAL SCIENCE    AND    A Guide to Purity and Physical Manhood    ADVICE TO MAIDEN, WIFE, AND MOTHER    LOVE, COURTSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.           *       *       *       *       *    BY    PROF.

The old maxim, that \"Knowledge is power,\" is a true one, but there is  still a greater truth: \"KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY.\" Safety amid physical ills  that beset mankind, and safety amid the moral pitfalls that surround so  many young people, is the great crying demand of the age. {4}    2. CRITICISM.--While the aim of this work, though novel and to some extent  is daring, it is chaste, practical and to the point, and will be a boon and  a blessing to thousands who consult its pages. The world is full of  ignorance, and the ignorant will always criticise, because they live to  suffer ills, for they know no better. New light is fast falling upon the  dark corners, and the eyes of many are being opened.    3. RESEARCHES OF SCIENCE.--The researches of science in the past few years  have thrown light on many facts relating to the physiology of man and  woman, and the diseases to which they are subject, and consequently many  reformations have taken place in the treatment and prevention of diseases  peculiar to the sexes.    4. LOCK AND KEY.--Any information bearing upon the diseases of mankind  should not be kept under lock and key. The physician is frequently called  upon to speak in plain language to his patients upon some private and  startling disease contracted on account of ignorance. The better plan,  however, is to so educate and enlighten old and young upon the important  subjects of health, so that the necessity to call a physician may occur  less frequently.    5. PROGRESSION.--A large, respectable, though diminishing class in every  community, maintain that nothing that relates exclusively to either sex  should become the subject of popular medical instruction. But such an  opinion is radically wrong; ignorance is no more the mother of purity than  it is of religion. Enlightenment can never work injustice to him who  investigates.    6. AN EXAMPLE.--The men and women who study and practice medicine are not  the worse, but the better for such knowledge; so it would be to the  community in general if all would be properly instructed on the laws of  health which relate to the sexes.    7. CRIME AND DEGRADATION.--Had every person a sound understanding on the  relation of the sexes, one of the most fertile sources of crime and  degradation would be removed. Physicians know too well what sad  consequences are constantly occurring from a lack of proper knowledge on  these important subjects.    8. A CONSISTENT CONSIDERATION.--Let the reader of this work study its pages  carefully and be able to give safe counsel and advice to others, and  remember that purity of purpose and purity of character are the brightest  jewels in the crown of immortality.           *       *       *       *       *      {5}    The Beginning of Life.    [Illustration: Beginning Right.]    1. THE BEGINNING.--There is a charm in opening manhood which has commended  itself to the imagination in every age. The undefined hopes and promises of  the future--the dawning strength of intellect--the vigorous flow of  passion--the very exchange of home ties and protected joys for free and  manly pleasures, give to this period an interest and excitement unfelt,  perhaps, at any other.    {6}    2. THE GROWTH OF INDEPENDENCE.--Hitherto life has been to boys, as to  girls, a dependent existence--a sucker from the parent growth--a home  discipline of authority and guidance and communicated impulse. But  henceforth it is a transplanted growth of its own--a new and free power of  activity in which the mainspring is no longer authority or law from  without, but principle or opinion within. The shoot which has been  nourished under the shelter of the parent stem, and bent according to its  inclination, is transferred to the open world, where of its own impulse and  character it must take root, and grow into strength, or sink into weakness  and vice.    3. HOME TIES.--The thought of home must excite a pang even in the first  moments of freedom. Its glad shelter--its kindly guidance--its very  restraints, how dear and tender must they seem in parting! How brightly  must they shine in the retrospect as the youth turns from them to the  hardened and unfamiliar face of the world! With what a sweet,  sadly-cheering pathos they must linger in the memory! And then what chance  and hazard is there in his newly-gotten freedom! What instincts of warning  in its very novelty and dim inexperience! What possibilities of failure as  well as of success in the unknown future as it stretches before him!    4. VICE OR VIRTUE.--Certainly there is a grave importance as well as a  pleasant charm in the beginning of life. There is awe as well as excitement  in it when rightly viewed. The possibilities that lie in it of noble or  ignoble work--of happy self-sacrifice or ruinous self-indulgence--the  capacities in the right use of which it may rise to heights of beautiful  virtue, in the abuse of which it may sink to the depths of debasing  vice--make the crisis one of fear as well as of hope, of sadness as well as  of joy.    5. SUCCESS OR FAILURE.--It is wistful as well as pleasing to think of the  young passing year by year into the world, and engaging with its duties,  its interests, and temptations. Of the throng that struggle at the gates of  entrance, how many may reach their anticipated goal? Carry the mind forward  a few years, and some have climbed the hills of difficulty and gained the  eminence on which they wished to stand--some, although they may not have  done this, have kept their truth unhurt, their integrity unspoiled; but  others have turned back, or have perished by the way, or fallen in weakness  of will, no more to rise again; victims of their own sin.    6. WARNING.--As we place ourselves with the young at the opening gates of  life, and think of the end from the {7} beginning, it is a deep concern  more than anything else that fills us. Words of earnest argument and  warning counsel rather than of congratulation rise to our lips.    7. MISTAKES ARE OFTEN FATAL.--Begin well, and the habit of doing well will  become quite as easy as the habit of doing badly. \"Well begun is half  ended,\" says the proverb; \"and a good beginning is half the battle.\" Many  promising young men have irretrievably injured themselves by a first false  step at the commencement of life; while others, of much less promising  talents, have succeeded simply by beginning well, and going onward. The  good, practical beginning is, to a certain extent, a pledge, a promise, and  an assurance of the ultimate prosperous issue. There is many a poor  creature, now crawling through life, miserable himself and the cause of  sorrow to others, who might have lifted up his head and prospered, if,  instead of merely satisfying himself with resolutions of well-doing, he had  actually gone to work and made a good, practical beginning.    8. BEGIN AT THE RIGHT PLACE.--Too many are, however, impatient of results.  They are not satisfied to begin where their fathers did, but where they  left off. They think to enjoy the fruits of industry without working for  them. They cannot wait for the results of labor and application, but  forestall them by too early indulgence.           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: SOLID COMFORT AND GOOD HEALTH.]    Health a Duty.    Perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will both  be adequately cared for, as a diffusion of the belief that the preservation  of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as  physical morality.    Men's habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat their  bodies as they please. Disorder entailed by disobedience to nature's  dictates they regard as grievances, not as the effects of a conduct more or  less flagitious. Though the evil consequences inflicted on their  descendents and on future generations are often as great as those caused by  crime, they do not think themselves in any degree criminal.    It is true that in the case of drunkenness the viciousness of a bodily"]]]
