PREFACE.      Disappointment expressed by others and felt by myself that a History of  the Forest of Dean should never have appeared in print, and an impression  that a considerable amount of interesting information relative to it  might be brought together, combined I may add with the fact that there  seemed no probability of such a work being otherwise undertaken until old  usages and traditions had passed away, have induced me to attempt its  compilation.  I here venture to publish the fruit of my labours, in the  hope that the reader may derive some portion of that pleasure which the  prosecution of the work has afforded me, and trusting that the same  indulgent consideration which led the officers of the Government, the  gentlemen of the neighbourhood, and many of the intelligent Foresters to  aid in the execution, will by them and the public be extended to the work  itself.    I have endeavoured to make it as complete as possible by supplying every  known circumstance, mostly in the words of the original narrator, and yet  trying so to harmonize the whole as to engage the attention of the  general reader, but more particularly of the residents in the district,  by acquainting them with the past and present state of one of the most  interesting and remarkable localities in the kingdom.

The district known as \"the Forest of Dean\" is situated within that part  of Gloucestershire which is bounded by the rivers Severn and Wye.  Its  name is of doubtful origin.  Was it so called from its proximity to the  town of Mitcheldean, or Dean Magna, mentioned in Domesday Book, and  which, agreeably to its name, is situated in a wooded valley, the word  \"Dean,\" or \"Dene,\" being Saxon, and signifying a dale or den?--or do we  accept the statement of Giraldus, and some other writers, that the Forest  of Dean obtained its name from the Danes sheltering themselves in it,  secured by its shades and thickets from the retaliation of the  neighbouring people, whose country they had devastated?--Or, again, do we  \"fancy,\" with Camden, that \"by cutting off a syllable it is derived from  Arden, which word the Gauls and Britons heretofore seemed to have used  for a wood, since two very great forests, the one in Gallia Belgica, the  other amongst us in Warwickshire, are called by one and the same name,  Arden\"?  This latter suggestion Evelyn, in his 'Sylva,' accepts, in which  he is supported by the fact that the name of \"Dean\" is first met with in  William the Norman's survey.    Probably the earliest trace of this locality being inhabited exists in  the Druidical rocks which are found on the high lands on the  Gloucestershire side of the Wye.  The chief of them is \"the Buck Stone,\"  so called perhaps from the deer which sheltered beneath it, or else from  its fancied resemblance to that animal when viewed from certain distant  spots.  It is a huge mass of rock poised on the very crest of Staunton  Hill, which being of a pyramidal form, and almost 1000 feet high, renders  the stone on its summit visible in one direction as far as Ross, nine  miles off.  A careful examination of the structure of the rock, and  particularly of the character of its base, will show that its position is  natural.  But that the Druids had appropriated it to sacrificial  purposes, is evident from a rudely hollowed stone which lies adjacent.  In shape \"the Buck Stone\" is almost flat on the top, and four-sided, the  north-east side measuring sixteen feet five inches, the north seventeen  feet, the south-west nine feet, and the south side twelve feet.  The face  of the rock on which it rests slopes considerably, and the bearing point  is only two feet across.  This part may be an unbroken neck of rock, but  apparently the entire block has crushed down upon its base, as though,  from having once formed the extremity of the portion of cliff near, it  had fallen away, and had accidentally balanced itself in its present  position. {2}  The texture of \"the Buck Stone\" is similar to that of the  slab of rock on which it rests, commonly known as the old red sandstone  conglomerate of quartz pebbles (a stratum of which extends through the  whole district), exceedingly hard in most of its veins, but very  perishable in others; and hence perhaps the form and origin of this  singular object.                            [Picture: The Buck Stone]    In addition to the above, there is a large mass of grit-stone, from nine  to ten feet high, standing in a field on the north side of the road  leading from Bream to St. Briavel's, named \"the Long Stone.\"  Another,  called by the same name, and of similar character, occurs on the  north-east side of the Staunton and Coleford road; but nothing remarkable  is known of either of them, only their weather-worn appearance shows that  they have been exposed to the action of the elements during many  centuries.    Next in order of time to the above remains are the ancient Iron-mines,  locally termed \"Scowles,\" {4} which were undoubtedly worked when this  island was occupied by the Romans.  This appears certain from the coins,  &c., which have been found deeply buried in the heaps of iron cinders  derived from the workings of these mines.

And in the Traite d'Ornithologie the same         author amplifies thus what he has written: 'Fou         Manche de Velours; Sula dactylatra, Less. Zool.         de la Coq., Texte, part. 2, p. 494.

Texte, p. 601._          THE RUKH OF MARCO POLO      Marco Polo, had he confined himself to a sober narration of his travels,  would have left to posterity a valuable record of the political  institutions and national customs of the peoples of his day in the Far  East. He was not satisfied with doing this, but added to his narrative a  number of _on-dit_ more or less marvellous in character, which he  collected from credulous or inventive persons with whom he came into  contact, principally from mariners and from other travellers.    Of these addenda to his story not one is more incredible than that of  the rukh, and yet that addendum may be regarded as indicating the  transition from the utterly incredible to the admixture of truth with  fiction in bird-lore. For, whilst the rukh possessed some  characteristics which are utterly fabulous, others are credible enough.  We are told, for example, that it resembled an eagle, that it was  carnivorous, that it possessed remarkable powers of flight, and that it  visited islands which lay to the south of Zanzibar, within the influence  of an ocean current which rendered difficult or impossible a voyage from  these regions to India, and which therefore must have tended in a  southerly direction. In this current we have no difficulty in  recognising that of Mozambique. On the other hand, that the rukh had an  expanse of wing of thirty paces, and that it could lift an elephant in  its talons, are of course utterly incredible assertions.    The rukh therefore holds a position in bird-lore intermediate between  that of the phoenix and that of the pelican fed upon the blood of its  mother whose beak is tipped with red, or that of the barnacle goose, of  which the name suggests the mollusc,[1] the barnacle, and which was said  to proceed from the mollusc or that of the bird of paradise, the feet of  which were cut off by the Malay traders who sold the skins, and which  were commonly reported never to have had feet, but to float perpetually  in the air.    Thus two streams united into one floated the conception of the rukh--a  mythological stream taking its rise from the simourgh of the Persians  and a stream of fact taking its rise in the observation of a real bird  which visited certain islands off the south-east coast of Africa, and  which is said to have resembled an eagle and may have been a sea-eagle.  With commendable reticence lexicographers tell us that 'rukh' was the  name of a bird of mighty wing.        [1] I.e., a fabulous mollusc; the barnacle is not now regarded as a        mollusc.          THE PENGUINS AND THE SEALS  OF THE ANGRA DE SAM BRAS      There exists an anonymous narrative of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama  to India under the title _Roteiro da Viagem de Vasco da Gama em  MCCCCXCVII_. Although it is called a roteiro, it is in fact a purely  personal and popular account of the voyage, and does not contain either  sailing directions or a systematic description of all the ports which  were visited, as one might expect in a roteiro. There is no reason to  believe that it was written by Vasco da Gama. An officer in such high  authority would not be likely to write his narrative anonymously. The  faulty and variable orthography of the roteiro also renders improbable  the hypothesis that Vasco da Gama was the author.    The journal of the first voyage of Columbus contains many allusions to  the birds which were seen in the course of it by the great discoverer.  In this respect the roteiro of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama  resembles it. The journal of Columbus is the earliest record of an  important voyage of discovery which recognises natural history as an aid  to navigators, the roteiro is the next.    The author of the roteiro notes that birds resembling large herons were  seen in the month of August, 1497, at which time, I opine, the vessels  of Da Gama were not far from the Gulf of Guinea, or were, perhaps,  making their way across that gulf. On the 27th of October, as the  vessels approached the south-west coast of Africa, whales and seals  were encountered, and also 'quoquas.'    'Quoquas' is the first example of the eccentric orthography of our  author. 'Quoquas' is, no doubt, his manner of writing 'conchas,' that is  to say 'shells'; the _til_ over the o is absent; perhaps that is a  typographical error; probably the author wrote or intended to write  quoquas. These shells may have been those of nautili.    On the 8th of November the vessels under the command of Vasco da Gama  cast anchor in a wide bay which extended from east to west, and which  was sheltered from all winds excepting that which blew from the  north-west. It was subsequently estimated that this anchorage was sixty  leagues distant from the Angra de Sam Bras; and as the Angra de Sam Bras  was estimated to be sixty leagues distant from the Cape of Good Hope,  the sheltered anchorage must have been in proximity to the Cape.    The voyagers named it the Angra de Santa Elena, and it may have been the  bay which is now known as St. Helen's Bay. But it is worthy of note that  the G. de Sta. Ellena of the Cantino Chart is laid down in a position  which corresponds rather with that of Table Bay than with that of St.  Helen's Bay.    The Portuguese came into contact with the inhabitants of the country  adjacent to the anchorage. These people had tawny complexions, and  carried wooden spears tipped with horn--assagais of a kind--and bows and  arrows. They also used foxes' tails attached to short wooden handles. We  are not informed for what purposes the foxes' tails were used. Were they  used to brush flies away, or were they insignia of authority? The food  of the natives was the flesh of whales, seals, and antelopes  (gazellas), and the roots of certain plants. Crayfish or 'Cape lobsters'  abounded near the anchorage.    The author of the roteiro affirms that the birds of the country  resembled the birds in Portugal, and that amongst them were cormorants,  larks, turtle-doves, and gulls. The gulls are called 'guayvotas,' but  'guayvotas' is probably another instance of the eccentric orthography of  the author and equivalent to 'gaivotas.'    In December the squadron reached the Angra de Sao Bras, which was either  Mossel Bay or another bay in close proximity to Mossel Bay. Here  penguins and seals were in great abundance. The author of the roteiro  calls the penguins 'sotelycairos,' which is more correctly written  'sotilicarios' by subsequent writers. The word is probably related to  the Spanish _sotil_ and the Latin _subtilis_, and may contain an  allusion to the supposed cunning of the penguins, which disappear by  diving when an enemy approaches.    The sotilicarios, says the chronicler, could not fly because there"]]]
