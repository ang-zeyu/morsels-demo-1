REDWING'S SPECKLED EGG    Old Mother West Wind came down from the Purple Hills in the golden light  of the early morning. Over her shoulders was slung a bag--a great big  bag--and in the bag were all of Old Mother West Wind's children, the  Merry Little Breezes.    Old Mother West Wind came down from the Purple Hills to the Green  Meadows and as she walked she crooned a song:         \"Ships upon the ocean wait;        I must hurry, hurry on!        Mills are idle if I'm late;        I must hurry, hurry on.\"    When she reached the Green Meadows Old Mother West Wind opened her bag,  turned it upside down and shook it. Out tumbled all the Merry Little  Breezes and began to spin round and round for very joy, for you see they  were to lay in the Green Meadows all day long until Old Mother West Wind  should come back at night and take them all to their home behind the  Purple Hills.    First they raced over to see Johnny Chuck. They found Johnny Chuck  sitting just outside his door eating his breakfast. One, for very  mischief, snatched right out of Johnny Chuck's mouth the green leaf of  corn he was eating, and ran away with it. Another playfully pulled his  whiskers, while a third rumpled up his hair.    Johnny Chuck pretended to be very cross indeed, but really he didn't  mind a bit, for Johnny Chuck loved the Merry Little Breezes and played  with them everyday.    And if they teased Johnny Chuck they were good to him, too. When they  saw Farmer Brown coming across the Green Meadows with a gun one of them  would dance over to Johnny Chuck and whisper to him that Farmer Brown  was coming, and then Johnny Chuck would hide away, deep down in his snug  little house under ground, and Farmer Brown would wonder and wonder why  it was that he never, never could get near enough to shoot Johnny Chuck.  But he never, never could.    When the Merry Little Breezes left Johnny Chuck they raced across the  Green Meadows to the Smiling Pool to say good morning to Grandfather  Frog who sat on a big lily pad watching for green flies for breakfast.    \"Chug-arum,\" said Grandfather Frog, which was his way of saying good  morning.    Just then along came a fat green fly and up jumped Grandfather Frog.  When he sat down again on the lily pad the fat green fly was nowhere to  be seen, but Grandfather Frog looked very well satisfied indeed as he  contentedly rubbed his white waistcoat with one hand.    \"What is the news, Grandfather Frog?\" cried the Merry Little Breezes.    \"Mrs. Redwing has a new speckled egg in her nest in the bulrushes,\" said  Grandfather Frog.    \"We must see it,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, and away they all ran  to the swamp where the bulrushes grow.    Now someone else had heard of Mrs. Redwing's dear little nest in the  bulrushes, and he had started out bright and early that morning to  try and find it, for he wanted to steal the little speckled eggs just  because they were pretty. It was Tommy Brown, the farmer's boy.    When the Merry Little Breezes reached the swamp where the bulrushes  grow they found poor Mrs. Redwing in great distress. She was afraid that  Tommy Brown would find her dear little nest, for he was very, very near  it, and his eyes were very, very sharp.    \"Oh,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, \"we must help Mrs. Redwing save  her pretty speckled eggs from bad Tommy Brown!\"    So one of the Merry Little Breezes whisked Tommy Brown's old straw hat  off his head over into the Green Meadows. Of course Tommy ran after it.  Just as he stooped to pick it up another little Breeze ran away with  it. Then they took turns, first one little Breeze, then another little  Breeze running away with the old straw hat just as Tommy Brown would  almost get his hands on it. Down past the Smiling Pool and across the  Laughing Brook they raced and chased the old straw hat, Tommy Brown  running after it, very cross, very red in the face, and breathing very  hard. Way across the Green Meadows they ran to the edge of the wood,  where they hung the old straw hat in the middle of a thorn tree. By the  time Tommy Brown had it once more on his head he had forgotten all about  Mrs. Redwing and her dear little nest. Besides, he heard the breakfast  horn blowing just then, so off he started for home up the Lone Little  Path through the wood.    And all the Merry Little Breezes danced away across the Green Meadows  to the swamp where the bulrushes grow to see the new speckled egg in the  dear little nest where Mrs. Redwing was singing for joy. And while she  sang the Merry Little Breezes danced among the bulrushes, for they knew,  and Mrs. Redwing knew, that some day out of that pretty new speckled egg  would come a wee baby Redwing.        CHAPTER II WHY GRANDFATHER FROG HAS NO TAIL    Old Mother West Wind had gone to her day's work, leaving all the Merry  Little Breezes to play in the Green Meadows. They had played tag and run  races with the Bees and played hide and seek with the Sun Beams, and now  they had gathered around the Smiling Pool where on a green lily pad sat  Grandfather Frog.    Grandfather Frog was old, very old, indeed, and very, very wise. He wore  a green coat and his voice was very deep. When Grandfather Frog  spoke everybody listened very respectfully. Even Billy Mink treated  Grandfather Frog with respect, for Billy Mink's father and his father's  father could not remember when Grandfather Frog had not sat on the lily  pad watching for green flies.    Down in the Smiling Pool were some of Grandfather Frog's  great-great-great-great-great grandchildren. You wouldn't have known  that they were his grandchildren unless some one told you. They didn't  look the least bit like Grandfather Frog. They were round and fat and  had long tails and perhaps this is why they were called Pollywogs.    \"Oh Grandfather Frog, tell us why you don't have a tail as you did when  you were young,\" begged one of the Merry Little Breezes.    Grandfather Frog snapped up a foolish green fly and settled himself on  his big lily pad, while all the Merry Little Breezes gathered round to  listen.    \"Once on a time,\" began Grandfather Frog, \"the Frogs ruled the world,  which was mostly water. There was very little dry land--oh, very little  indeed! There were no boys to throw stones and no hungry Mink to gobble  up foolish Frog-babies who were taking a sun bath!\"    Billy Mink, who had joined the Merry Little Breezes and was listening,  squirmed uneasily and looked away guiltily.    \"In those days all the Frogs had tails, long handsome tails of which  they were very, very proud indeed,\" continued Grandfather Frog. \"The  King of all the Frogs was twice as big as any other Frog, and his tail  was three times as long. He was very proud, oh, very proud indeed of  his long tail. He used to sit and admire it until he thought that there  never had been and never could be another such tail. He used to wave it  back and forth in the water, and every time he waved it all the other  Frogs would cry 'Ah!' and 'Oh!' Every day the King grew more vain. He  did nothing at all but eat and sleep and admire his tail.    \"Now all the other Frogs did just as the King did, so pretty soon none  of the Frogs were doing anything but sitting about eating, sleeping and  admiring their own tails and the King's.    \"Now you all know that people who do nothing worth while in this world  are of no use and there is little room for them. So when Mother Nature  saw how useless had become the Frog tribe she called the King Frog  before her and she said:    \"'Because you can think of nothing but your beautiful tail it shall be  taken away from you. Because you do nothing but eat and sleep your mouth  shall become wide like a door, and your eyes shall start forth from your  head. You shall become bow-legged and ugly to look at, and all the world  shall laugh at you.'    \"The King Frog looked at his beautiful tail and already it seemed to  have grown shorter. He looked again and it was shorter still. Every  time he looked his tail had grown shorter and smaller. By and by when he  looked there was nothing left but a little stub which he couldn't even  wriggle. Then even that disappeared, his eyes popped out of his head and  his mouth grew bigger and bigger.\"    Old Grandfather Frog stopped and looked sadly at a foolish green fly  coming his way. \"Chug-arum,\" said Grandfather Frog, opening his mouth  very wide and hopping up in the air. When he sat down again on his big  lily pad the green fly was nowhere to be seen. Grandfather Frog smacked  his lips and continued:    \"And from that day to this every Frog has started life with a big tail,  and as he has grown bigger and bigger his tail has grown smaller and  smaller, until finally it disappears, and then he remembers how foolish  and useless it is to be vain of what nature has given us. And that is  how I came to lose my tail,\" finished Grandfather Frog.    \"Thank you,\" shouted all the Merry Little Breezes. \"We won't forget.\"    Then they ran a race to see who could reach Johnny Chuck's home first  and"]]]
