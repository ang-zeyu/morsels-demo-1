And which way did the   power run in the four-year-old   in the garden, playing   with a pie plate?_       _the   putnam   tradition_    By S. DORMAN    Illustrated by SCHELLING      It was an old house not far from the coast, and had descended generation  by generation to the women of the Putnam family. Progress literally went  by it: a new four-lane highway had been built two hundred yards from the  ancient lilacs at the doorstep. Long before that, in the time of Cecily  Putnam's husband, power lines had been run in, and now on cold nights  the telephone wires sounded like a concert of cellos, while inside with  a sound like the breaking of beetles, the grandmother Cecily moved  through the walls in the grooves of tradition.    Simone Putnam, her granddaughter; Nina Putnam, her great-granddaughter;  the unbroken succession of matriarchs continued, but times the old woman  thought that in Simone it was weakened, and she looked at the  four-year-old Nina askance, waiting, waiting, for some good sign.    Sometimes one of the Putnam women had given birth to a son, who grew  sickly and died, or less often, grew healthy and fled. The husbands were  usually strangers to the land, the house, and the women, and spent a  lifetime with the long-lived Putnam wives, and died, leaving their  strange signs: telephone wires, electric lights, water pumps, brass  plumbing.    Sam Harris came and married Simone, bringing with him an invasion of  washer, dryer, toaster, mixer, coffeemaster, until the current poured  through the walls of the house with more vigor than the blood in the old  woman's veins.    \"You don't approve of him,\" Simone said to her grandmother.    \"It's his trade,\" Cecily Putnam answered. \"Our men have been carpenters,  or farmers, or even schoolmasters. But an engineer. Phui!\"    Simone was washing the dishes, gazing out across the windowsill where  two pink and white Murex shells stood, to the tidy garden beyond where  Nina was engaged in her private games.    She dried the dishes by passing her hand once above each plate or glass,  bringing it to a dry sparkle. It saved wear on the dishtowels, and it  amused her.    \"Sam's not home very much,\" she said in a placating voice. She herself  had grown terrified, since her marriage, that she wouldn't be able to  bear the weight of her past. She felt its power on her and couldn't  carry it. Cecily had brought her up, after her father had disappeared  and her mother had died in an unexplained accident. Daily she saw the  reflection of her failure in the face of her grandmother, who seemed  built of the same seasoned and secure wood as the old Putnam house.  Simone looked at her grandmother, whom she loved, and became a mere  vapor.    \"He's not home so much,\" Simone said.           *       *       *       *       *    Her face was small, with a pointed chin, and she had golden-red hair  which she wore loose on her shoulders. Nina, too, had a small face, but  it was neither so pale nor so delicate as her mother's, as if Sam's  tougher substance had filled her out and strengthened her bone  structure. If it was true that she, Simone, was a weak link, then Sam's  strength might have poured into the child, and there would be no more  Putnam family and tradition.    \"People don't change that easily,\" the old woman said.    \"But things--\" Simone began. The china which had a history of five  generations slipped out of her hands and smashed; Sam's toaster wouldn't  toast or pop up; Simone couldn't even use the telephone for fear of  getting a wrong number, or no number at all.    \"Things, things!\" her grandmother cried. \"It's blood that counts. If the  blood is strong enough, things dissolve. They're just garbage, all those  things, floating on the surface of our history. It's our history that's  deep. That's what counts.\"    \"You're afraid of Sam,\" the young woman accused.    \"Not afraid of any man!\" Cecily said, straightening her back. \"But I'm  afraid for the child. Sam has no family tradition, no depth, no talent  handed down and perfected. A man with his head full of wheels and  wires.\"    Simone loved him. She leaned on him and grew about him, and he supported  her tenderly. She wasn't going to give him up for the sake of some  abstract tradition--    \"--it's not abstract,\" her grandmother said with spirit. \"It's in your  blood. Or why don't you sweep the floors the way other women do? The way  Sam's mother must?\"    Simone had begun to clean the house while she was thinking, moving her  hand horizontally across the floor, at the height of her hip, and the  dust was following the motion of her hand and moving in a small,  sun-brightened river toward the trash basket in the kitchen corner. Now  Simone raised her hand to her face to look at it, and the river of dust  rose like a serpent and hung a foot below her hand.    \"Yes,\" she agreed, \"at least I can clean the house. If I don't touch the  good china, and look where I'm going.\"    \"Phui,\" the old woman said again, angrily. \"Don't feel so sorry for  yourself.\"    \"Not for myself,\" Simone mumbled, and looked again toward the garden  where her daughter was doing something with three stones and a pie plate  full of spring water.    \"I do despair of Nina,\" Cecily said, as she had said before. \"She's  four, and has no appearance. Not even balance. She fell out of the  applerose tree, and couldn't even help herself.\" Suddenly the old woman  thrust her face close to her granddaughter. It was smooth, round, and  sweet as a young kernel of corn. The eyes, sunk down under the bushy  grey brows, were cold and clear grey.    \"Simone,\" the old woman said. \"You didn't lie to me? You did know she  was falling, and couldn't get back in time to catch her?\"    A shudder passed through Simone's body. There was no blood in her veins,  only water; no marrow in her bones, they were empty, and porous as a  bird's. Even the roots of her hair were weak, and now the sweat was  starting out on her scalp as she faced her grandmother and saw the  bristling shapes of seven generations of Putnam women behind her.    \"You lied,\" the old woman said. \"You didn't know she was falling.\"    Simone was a vapor, a mere froth blowing away on the first breeze.    \"My poor dear,\" the old woman said in a gentle voice. \"But how could you  marry someone like Sam? Don't you know what will happen? He'll dissolve  us, our history, our talents, our pride. Nina is nothing but an ordinary  little child.\"    \"She's a good child,\" Simone said, trying not to be angry. She wanted  her child to be loved, to be strong. \"Nina isn't a common child,\" she  said, with her head bent. \"She's very bright.\"    \"A man with his head full of wheels, who's at home with electricity and  wires,\" the old woman went on. \"We've had them before, but never allowed  them to dominate us. My own husband was such a man, but he was only  allowed to make token gestures, such as having the power lines put in.  He never understood how they worked.\" She lowered her voice to a  whisper, \"Your Sam understands. I've heard him talk to the water pump.\"    \"That's why you're afraid of him,\" Simone said. \"Not because I'm weak,  and he might take something away from me, but because he's strong, and  he might give us something. Then everything would change, and you're  afraid of that. Nina might be our change.\" She pointed toward the  garden.           *       *       *       *       *    Following the white line of her granddaughter's finger, Cecily looked  out into the garden and saw Nina turn toward them as though she knew  they were angry. The child pointed with one finger directly at them in  the house. There was a sharp crackle, and something of a brilliant and  vibrating blue leaped between the out-stretched fingers of mother and  daughter, and flew up like a bird to the power lines above.    \"Mommy,\" Nina called.    Simone's heart nearly broke with wonder and fright. Her grandmother  contemptuously passed through the kitchen door and emerged on the step  outside, but Simone opened the door and left it open behind her. \"What  was that?\" she asked Nina. \"Was it a bluebird?\"    \"Don't be silly,\" Nina said. She picked up the pie plate and brought it  toward them. Cecily's face was white and translucent, one hand went to  her throat as the child approached.    Brimfull of crackling blue fire with a fluctuating heart of yellow, the  pie plate came toward them, held between Nina's small, dusty hands. Nina  grinned at them. \"I stole it out of the wires,\" she said.    Simone thought she would faint with a mixture of joy and fear. \"Put it  back,\" she whispered. \"Please put it back.\"    \"Oh Mommy,\" Nina said, beginning to whine. \"Not now. Not right away. I  just got it. I've done it lots of times.\" The pie plate crackled and  hissed in the steady, small hands.    Simone could feel the old woman's shocked silence behind her. \"You  mustn't carry it in a pie plate, it's dangerous,\" Simone said to her  child, but she could see Nina was in no danger. \"How often have you done  this?\" She could feel her skirt and her hair billow with electricity.    \"Lots of times. You don't like it, do you?\" She became teasing and  roguish, when she looked most like Sam. Suddenly she threw back her head  and opened her mouth, and tilting up the pie plate she drank it empty.  Her reddish gold hair sprang out in crackling rays around her face, her  eyes flashed and sparks flew out between her teeth before she closed her  mouth.    \"Nina!\" the old woman cried, and began to crumple, falling slowly  against Simone in a complete faint. Simone caught her in trembling hands  and lowered her gently. She said to her daughter, \"You mustn't do that  in front of Grandy. You're a bad girl, you knew it would scare her,\" and  to herself she said: I must stop babbling, the child knows I'm being  silly.

The Man in the Iron Mask we're  familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.  [Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the  confusion...but wait...there's yet more reason for confusion.]    We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four  etexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la  Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in  the Iron Mask.    One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,  entitled Ten Years Later, says it's the sequel to The Three Musketeers.  While this is technically true, there's another book, Twenty Years  After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts  that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years  After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty  Years \"After\" the original story...however, this is why the different  words \"After\" and \"Later\"...the Ten Years \"After\" is ten years after  the Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the  D'Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the  subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different  volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the  first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later  can, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the  four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,  it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material  in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the  series which may prove helpful:    The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D'Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1625-1628.    Twenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D'Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but  second in time sequence!!!]    Ten Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the  D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.    The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)--First  75 chapters of the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the  year 1660.    Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (our new etext)--Chapters 76-140 of that  third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661. [In  this particular editing of it]    Louise de la Valliere: forthcoming (our next etext)--Chapters 141-208 of  the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1661.    The Man in the Iron Mask: forthcoming (following)--Chapters 209-269 of  the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1661-1673.    If we've calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to  the modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still  widely circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de  Bragelonne.

It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had  found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a  history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures  of a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost  immediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and  ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers  would enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends,  Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the  scenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English  history.    Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,  and became the three D'Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief  summary of the first two novels:    The Three Musketeers (serialized March-July, 1844): The year is 1625.  The young D'Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and  almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.  Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's  guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.  The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord  to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them  across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the  Cardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,  named simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of  Austria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the  four friends.    Twenty Years After (serialized January-August, 1845): The year is now  1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has  died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit  upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,  the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.  D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have  retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de  la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.  Aramis, whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of  shedding the musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has  married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But  trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the  institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at  home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D'Artagnan brings  his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,  but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death  at the musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our  heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,  quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.    The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October, 1847  --January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English  translation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at  various points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does  not give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the  three-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,  Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of  this etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition  does, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,  Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the last etext:    The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and  D'Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become  disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with  the Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on  his own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,  and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune  in the process. D'Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich  citizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's  brother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own  estate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to  assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly  Mazarin's trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,  the king's superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any  means necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant  bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet's  loyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king's attention  that Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could  possibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation  against the king. Louis calls D'Artagnan out of retirement and sends  him to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his  long-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At  Belle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications  is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all.  The blueprints for the island, although in Porthos's handwriting,  show evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.  D'Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,  which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting  that D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis  tricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos,  and sends"]]]
