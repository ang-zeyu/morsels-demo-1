Just once it came, then once again the stillness of the  wilderness night, the stillness of vast, untraversed solitude. The Boy  lifted his eyes and glanced across the thin reek of the camp-fire at  Jabe Smith, who sat smoking contemplatively. Answering the glance, the  woodsman muttered \"old tree fallin',\" and resumed his passive  contemplation of the sticks glowing keenly in the fire. The Boy, upon  whom, as soon as he entered the wilderness, the taciturnity of the  woodsfolk descended as a garment, said nothing, but scanned his  companion's gaunt face with a gravely incredulous smile.    So wide-spread and supreme was the silence that five seconds after  that single strange sound had died out it seemed, somehow, impossible  to believe it had ever been. The light gurgle of the shallow and  shrunken brook which ran past the open front of the travellers'  \"lean-to\" served only to measure the stillness. Both Jabe and the Boy,  since eating their dinner, had gradually forgotten to talk. As the  moon rose over the low, fir-crested hills they had sunk into reverie,  watching the camp-fire die down.    At last, with a sort of crisp whisper a stick, burnt through the  middle, fell apart, and a flicker of red flame leaped up. The woodsman  knocked out his pipe, rose slowly to his feet, stretched his gaunt  length, and murmured, \"Reckon we might as well turn in.\"    \"That's all right for you, Jabe,\" answered the Boy, rising also,  tightening his belt, and reaching for his rifle, \"but I'm going off to  see what I can see. Night's the time to see things in the woods.\"    Jabe grunted non-committally, and began spreading his blanket in the  lean-to. \"Don't forgit to come back for breakfast, that's all,\" he  muttered. He regarded the Boy as a phenomenally brilliant hunter and  trapper spoiled by sentimental notions.    To the Boy, whose interest in all pertaining to woodcraft was much  broader and more sympathetic than that of his companion, Jabe's  interpretation of the sound of the falling tree had seemed hasty and  shallow. He knew that there was no better all-round woodsman in these  countries than Jabe Smith; but he knew also that Jabe's interest in  the craft was limited pretty strictly to his activities as hunter,  trapper and lumberman. Just now he was all lumberman. He was acting as  what is called a \"timber-cruiser,\" roaming the remoter and less-known  regions of the wilderness to locate the best growths of spruce and  pine for the winter's lumbering operations, and for the present  his keen faculties were set on the noting of tree growths, and  water-courses, and the lay of the land for the getting out of a  winter's cutting. On this particular cruise the Boy--who, for all  the disparity in their years and the divergence in their views, was  his most valued comrade--had accompanied him with a special object  in view. The region they were cruising was one which had never been  adequately explored, and it was said to be full of little unnamed,  unmapped lakes and streams, where, in former days, the Indians had  had great beaver hunting.    When the sound of the falling tree came to his ears across the  night-silence, the Boy at once said to himself, \"Beavers, at work!\" He  said it to himself, not aloud, because he knew that Jabe also, as a  trapper, would be interested in beavers; and he had it in his mind to  score a point on Jabe. Noiseless as a lynx in his soft-soled  \"larrigans,\" he ascended the half-empty channel of the brook, which  here strained its shrunken current through rocks and slate-slabs,  between steep banks. The channel curved steadily, rounding the  shoulder of a low ridge. When he felt that he had travelled somewhat  less than half a mile, he came out upon a bit of swampy marsh, beyond  which, over the crest of a low dam, spread the waters of a tranquil  pond shining like a mirror in the moonlight.    The Boy stopped short, his heart thumping with excitement and  anticipation. Here before him was what he had come so far to find.  From his books and from his innumerable talks with hunter and trapper,  he knew that the dam and the shining, lonely pond were the work of  beavers. Presently he distinguished amid the sheen of the water a  tiny, grassy islet, with a low, dome-shaped, stick-covered mound at  one end of it. This, plainly, was a beaver house, the first he had  ever seen. His delighted eyes, observing it at this distance, at once  pronounced it immeasurably superior to the finest and most pretentious  muskrat-house he had ever seen--a very palace, indeed, by comparison.  Then, a little further up the pond, and apparently adjoining the  shore, he made out another dome-shaped structure, broader and less  conspicuous than the first, and more like a mere pile of sticks. The  pond, which was several acres in extent, seemed to him an extremely  spacious domain for the dwellers in these two houses.    Presently he marked a black trail, as it were, moving down in the  middle of the radiance from the upper end of the pond. It was  obviously the trail of some swimmer, but much too broad, it seemed, to  be made by anything so small as a beaver. It puzzled him greatly. In  his eagerness he pushed noiselessly forward, seeking a better view,  till he was within some thirty feet of the dam. Then he made out a  small dark spot in the front of the trail,--evidently a beaver's head;  and at last he detected that the little swimmer was carrying a bushy  branch, one end held in his mouth while the rest was slung back  diagonally across his shoulders.    The Boy crept forward like a cat, his gray eyes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2995"],[0,"Tacitus on Germany (#1)"],[1,"ON GERMANY    Translated by Thomas Gordon             PREPARER'S NOTE         This text was prepared from a 1910 edition, published       by P. F. Collier & Son Company, New York.          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    The dates of the birth and death of Tacitus are uncertain, but it is  probable that he was born about 54 A. D. and died after 117. He was a  contemporary and friend of the younger Pliny, who addressed to him some  of his most famous epistles. Tacitus was apparently of the equestrian  class, was an advocate by training, and had a reputation as an orator,  though none of his speeches has survived. He held a number of important  public offices, and married the daughter of Agricola, the conqueror of  Britain, whose life he wrote.    The two chief works of Tacitus, the \"Annals\" and the \"Histories,\"  covered the history of Rome from the death of Augustus to A. D. 96;  but the greater part of the \"Histories\" is lost, and the fragment that  remains deals only with the year 69 and part of 70. In the \"Annals\"  there are several gaps, but what survives describes a large part of the  reigns of Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero. His minor works, besides the  life of Agricola, already mentioned, are a \"Dialogue on Orators\" and the  account of Germany, its situation, its inhabitants, their character and  customs, which is here printed.    Tacitus stands in the front rank of the historians of antiquity for the  accuracy of his learning, the fairness of his judgments, the richness,  concentration, and precision of his style. His great successor, Gibbon,  called him a \"philosophical historian, whose writings will instruct the  last generations of mankind\"; and Montaigne knew no author \"who, in a  work of history, has taken so broad a view of human events or given a  more just analysis of particular characters.\"    The \"Germany\" is a document of the greatest interest and importance,  since it gives us by far the most detailed account of the state of  culture among the tribes that are the ancestors of the modern Teutonic  nations, at the time when they first came into account with the  civilization of the Mediterranean.            TACITUS ON GERMANY      The whole of Germany is thus bounded; separated from Gaul, from Rhoetia  and Pannonia, by the rivers Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia by  mutual fear, or by high mountains: the rest is encompassed by the ocean,  which forms huge bays, and comprehends a tract of islands immense in  extent: for we have lately known certain nations and kingdoms there,  such as the war discovered. The Rhine rising in the Rhoetian Alps from a  summit altogether rocky and perpendicular, after a small winding towards  the west, is lost in the Northern Ocean. The Danube issues out of the  mountain Abnoba, one very high but very easy of ascent, and traversing  several nations, falls by six streams into the Euxine Sea; for its  seventh channel is absorbed in the Fenns.    The Germans, I am apt to believe, derive their original from no other  people; and are nowise mixed with different nations arriving amongst  them: since anciently those who went in search of new dwellings,  travelled not by land, but were carried in fleets; and into that mighty  ocean so boundless, and, as I may call it, so repugnant and forbidding,  ships from our world rarely enter. Moreover, besides the dangers from  a sea tempestuous, horrid and unknown, who would relinquish Asia, or  Africa, or Italy, to repair to Germany, a region hideous and rude, under  a rigorous climate, dismal to behold or to manure [to cultivate] unless  the same were his native country? In their old ballads (which amongst  them are the only sort of registers and history) they celebrate  _Tuisto_, a God sprung from the earth, and _Mannus_ his son, as the  fathers and founders of the nation. To _Mannus_ they assign three sons,  after whose names so many people are called; the Ingaevones, dwelling  next the ocean; the Herminones, in the middle country; and all the rest,  Instaevones. Some, borrowing a warrant from the darkness of antiquity,  maintain that the God had more sons, that thence came more denominations  of people, the Marsians, Gambrians, Suevians, and Vandalians, and that  these are the names truly genuine and original. For the rest, they  affirm Germany to be a recent word, lately bestowed: for that those  who first passed the Rhine and expulsed the Gauls, and are now named  Tungrians, were then called Germans: and thus by degrees the name of a  tribe prevailed, not that of the nation; so that by an appellation at  first occasioned by terror and conquest, they afterwards chose to be  distinguished, and assuming a name lately invented were universally  called _Germans_.    They have a tradition that Hercules also had been in their country, and  him above all other heroes they extol in their songs when they advance  to battle. Amongst them too are found that kind of verses by the recital  of which (by them called _Barding_) they inspire bravery; nay, by such  chanting itself they divine the success of the approaching fight. For,  according to the different din of the battle they urge furiously, or  shrink timorously. Nor does what they utter, so much seem to be singing  as the voice and exertion of valour. They chiefly study a tone fierce  and harsh, with a broken and unequal murmur, and therefore apply their  shields to their mouths, whence the voice may by rebounding swell with  greater fulness and force. Besides there are some of opinion, that  Ulysses, whilst he wandered about in his long and fabulous voyages, was  carried into this ocean and entered Germany, and that by him Asciburgium  was founded and named, a city at this day standing and inhabited upon  the bank of the Rhine: nay, that in the same place was formerly found an  altar dedicated to Ulysses, with the name of his father Laertes added  to his own, and that upon the confines of Germany and Rhoetia are still  extant certain monuments and tombs inscribed with Greek characters.  Traditions these which I mean not either to confirm with arguments of  my own or to refute. Let every one believe or deny the same according to  his own bent.    For myself, I concur in opinion with such as suppose the people of  Germany never to have mingled by inter-marriages with other nations, but  to have remained a people pure, and independent, and resembling none but  themselves. Hence amongst such a mighty multitude of men, the same make  and form is found in all, eyes stern and blue, yellow hair, huge bodies,  but vigorous only in the first onset. Of pains and labour they are not  equally patient, nor can they at all endure thrift and heat. To bear  hunger and cold they are hardened by their climate and soil.    Their lands, however somewhat different in aspect, yet taken all  together consist of gloomy forests or nasty marshes; lower and moister  towards Noricum and Pannonia; very apt to bear grain, but altogether  unkindly to fruit trees; abounding in flocks and herds, but generally  small of growth. Nor even in their oxen is found the usual stateliness,  no more than the natural ornaments and grandeur of head. In the number  of their herds they rejoice; and these are their only, these their most  desirable riches. Silver and gold the Gods have denied them, whether in  mercy or in wrath, I am unable to determine. Yet I would not venture to  aver that in Germany no vein of gold or silver is produced; for who has  ever searched? For the use and possession, it is certain they care not.  Amongst them indeed are to be seen vessels of silver, such as have  been presented to their Princes and Ambassadors, but holden in no other  esteem than vessels made of earth. The Germans however adjoining to our  frontiers value gold and silver for the purposes of commerce, and are  wont to distinguish and prefer certain of our coins. They who live more  remote are more primitive and simple in their dealings, and exchange  one commodity for another. The money which they like is the old and  long known, that indented [with milled edges], or that impressed with  a chariot and two horses. Silver too is what they seek more than gold,  from no fondness or preference, but because small pieces are more ready  in purchasing things cheap and common.    Neither in truth do they abound in iron, as from the fashion of their  weapons may be gathered. Swords they rarely use, or the larger spear.  They carry javelins or, in their own language, _framms_, pointed with a  piece of iron short and narrow, but so sharp and manageable, that with  the same weapon they can fight at a distance or hand to hand, just as  need requires. Nay, the horsemen also are content with a shield and a  javelin. The foot throw likewise weapons missive, each particular  is armed with many, and hurls them a mighty space, all naked or only  wearing a light cassock. In their equipment they show no ostentation;  only that their shields are diversified and adorned with curious  colours. With coats of mail very few are furnished, and hardly upon any  is seen a headpiece or helmet. Their horses are nowise signal either in  fashion or in fleetness; nor taught to wheel and bound, according to the  practice of the Romans: they only move them forward in a line, or turn  them right about, with such compactness and equality that no one is ever  behind the rest. To one who considers the whole it is manifest, that  in their foot their principal strength lies, and therefore they fight  intermixed with the motions and engagements of the cavalry. So that the  infantry are elected from amongst the most robust of their youth, and  placed in front of the army. The number to be sent is also ascertained,  out of every village _an hundred_, and by this very name they continue  to be called at home, _those of the hundred band_: thus what was at  first no more than a number, becomes thenceforth a title and distinction  of honour. In arraying their army, they divide"]]]
