The first  was of sooty blackness, black as a chimney at night time; the second,  dark as the night in the stormy season; the third, like a valley in  starlight; the fourth, with a light like the dawning. Then they came up  in the night-shine into the World of Knowing and Seeing.    So runs the Zuni myth, and it typifies well the mental development,  insight, and beauty of speech of the Indian tribes along the Pacific  Coast, from those of Alaska in the far-away Northland, with half of life  spent in actual darkness and more than half in the struggle for  existence against the cold and the storms loosed by fatal curiosity from  the bear's bag of bitter, icy winds, to the exquisite imagery of the  Zunis and other desert tribes, on their sunny plains in the Southland.    It was in the night-shine of this southern land, with its clear, dry air  and brilliant stars, that the Indians, looking up at the heavens above  them, told the story of the bag of stars of Utset, the First Mother, who  gave to the scarab beetle, when the floods came, the bag of Star People,  sending him first into the world above. It was a long climb to the world  above and the tired little fellow, once safe, sat down by the sack.  After a while he cut a tiny hole in the bag, just to see what was in it,  but the Star People flew out and filled the heavens everywhere. Yet he  saved a few stars by grasping the neck of the sack, and sat there,  frightened and sad, when Utset, the First Mother, asked what he had done  with the beautiful Star People.    The Sky-father himself, in those early years of the New-making, spread  out his hand with the palm downward, and into all the wrinkles of his  hand set the semblance of shining yellow corn-grains, gleaming like  sparks of fire in the dark of the early World-dawn. \"See,\" said  Sky-father to Earth-mother, \"our children shall be guided by these when  the Sun-father is not near and thy mountain terraces are as darkness  itself. Then shall our children be guided by light.\" So Sky-father  created the stars. Then he said, \"And even as these grains gleam upward  from the water, so shall seed grain like them spring up from the earth  when touched by water, to nourish our children.\"  And he created the  golden Seed-stuff of the corn.    It is around the beautiful Corn Maidens that perhaps the most delicate  of all imagery clings, Maidens offended when the dancers sought their  presence all too freely, no longer holding them so precious as in the  olden time, so that, in white garments, they became invisible in the  thickening white mists. Then sadly and noiselessly they stole in amongst  the people and laid their corn wands down amongst the trays, and laid  their white broidered garments thereon, as mothers lay soft kilting over  their babes. Even as the mists became they, and with the mists drifting,  fled away, to the south Summer-land.    They began the search for the Corn Maidens, found at last only by  Paiyatuma, the god of dawn, from whose flute came wonderful music, as of  liquid voices in caverns, or the echo of women's laughter in water  vases, heard only by men of nights as they wandered up and down the  river trail.    When he paused to rest on his journey, playing on his painted flute,  butterflies and birds sought him, and he sent them before to seek the  Maidens, even before they could hear the music of his song-sound. And  the Maidens filled their colored trays with seed-corn from their fields,  and over all spread broidered mantles, broidered with the bright colors  and the creature signs of the Summer-land, and thus following him,  journeyed only at night and dawn, as the dead do, and the stars also.    Back to the Seed People they came, but only to give to the ancients the  precious seed, and this having been given, the darkness of night fell  around them. As shadows in deep night, so these Maidens of the Seed of  Corn, the beloved and beautiful, were seen no more of men. But Shutsuka  walked behind the Maidens, whistling shrilly as they sped southward,  even as the frost wind whistles when the corn is gathered away, among  the lone canes and the dry leaves of a gleaned field.    The myths of California, in general, are of the same type as those given  in a preceding volume on the myths of the Pacific Northwest. Indeed many  of the myths of Northern Californian tribes are so obviously the same as  those of the Modocs and Klamath Indians that they have not been  repeated. Coyote and Fox reign supreme, as they do along the entire  coast, though the birds of the air take a greater part in the creation  of things. These stories are quaint and whimsical, but they lack the  beauty of the myths of the desert tribes. There is nothing in all  Californian myths, so far as I have studied them, which in any way  compares with the one of the Corn Maidens, referred to above, or the Sia  myths of the Cloud People. In the compilation of this volume, the same  idea has governed as in the two preceding volumes, simply the preparation  of a volume of the quainter, purer myths, suitable for general reading,  authentic, and with illustrations of the country portrayed, but with no  pretensions to being a purely scientific piece of work. Scientific  people know well the government documents and reports of learned  societies which contain myths of all kinds, good, bad, and indifferent.  But the volumes of this series are intended for popular use. Changes  have been made only in abridgments of long conversations and of  ceremonial details which detracted from the myth as a myth, even though  of great ethnological importance.    Especial credit is due in this volume to the work of the ethnologists  whose work has appeared in the publications of the Smithsonian  Institution, and the U. S. Geographical and Geological Surveys West of  the Rocky Mountains: to Mrs. Mathilda Cox Stevenson for the Sia myths,  and to the late James Stevenson for the Navajo myths and sand painting;  to the late Frank Hamilton Cushing for the Zuni myths, to the late Frank  Russell for the Pima myths, to the late Stephen Powers for the  Californian myths, and also to James Mooney and Cosmos Mindeleff. The  recent publications of the University of California on the myths of the  tribes of that State have not been included.    Thanks are also due to the Smithsonian Institution for the illustrations  accredited to them, to the Carnegie Institution of Washington for  illustrations from the Desert Botanical Laboratory at Tucson, Arizona,  and to Mr. Ferdinard Ellerman of the Mount Wilson Observatory and to  others.

NEW ZEALAND.                              GENERAL ASSEMBLY LIBRARY.              REPORT OF THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR 1924-25.              _Laid on the Table of the House of Representatives by Leave._          THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN to the CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT LIBRARY COMMITTEE.    SIR,--    I have the honour to submit the following report for the year 1924-25:--                            RECESS LIBRARY COMMITTEE.    The Recess Library Committee, the constitution of which was altered by  resolution passed by both Chambers of the Legislature at the close of  last session, held three meetings during the recess, under the  chairmanship of the Hon. the Speaker of the House of Representatives,  the Hon. Charles E. Statham. Two of these meetings were informal, as a  full quorum was unobtainable. At the third meeting, however, there was  a full quorum, and the business done at the previous meetings was duly  confirmed. In view of the great difficulty which obtains of securing a  quorum at the meetings as called, the question is worth consideration  as to the desirableness of making some slight alteration in the rule  under which the Recess Committee is now constituted.                            ADDITIONS TO THE LIBRARY.    The number of new accessions since the date of the last report is  2,089, which is lower than that in the previous Library year, the  previous total having been 2,700. This latter, however, includes some  500 volumes of the Herries bequest. Owing to the financial position of  the Library being much better at the end of the financial year, it is  more than probable that next year's report will chronicle a  substantially higher increase.    The various volumes of the Herries bequest have been repaired and  rebound where necessary, and have been added to the shelves in their  respective classes.    The total number of catalogued books and other accessions on the 18th  June was over 109,705--which, in view of the fact of the greatly  enhanced cost of books (the Library vote, L700, being to-day only L100  a year more than it was thirty years ago), must be deemed satisfactory.    Important orders for new books are now in course of execution, the  volumes being due early in this year's session. An attempt has been  made to cover all the more important additions in literature on the  great problems of the day; and, whilst economy has had to be practised,  and a careful selection made of the books and publications generally  which really count, it will, I think, be found that very few works of  outstanding merit and importance have been overlooked.    In accordance with the policy of not clashing with the Alexander H.  Turnbull Library, rare and expensive works of literature dealing with  the early history of New Zealand, Australia, and the Pacific have not  been bought, but all works of recent and current interest on the  Dominion and the Commonwealth, or affecting the various problems of the  Pacific, are regularly added.    Works on various political and social problems continue to be more  specially favoured by members of both branches of the Legislature, to  whom baskets of books are forwarded during the recess. After these,  biography is most in favour.                                  LIBRARY STAFF.    During the greater part of last year's recess the Chief Librarian was  absent in Australia in quest of better health; and he may be pardoned,  I trust, for here expressing his personal gratitude to the Minister in  Charge of the Legislative Department (the Hon. Mr. Nosworthy) and the  then Prime Minister (the Right Hon. W. F. Massey), for the great  consideration and kindness these gentlemen displayed in granting him  the necessary leave of absence.    Until the Chief Librarian's return, early in October, Mr. W. S.  Wauchop, M.A., who in August assumed the duties of First Assistant in  the Library, had charge of the institution, under the Joint Library  Committee. Mr. Wauchop has proved himself a most obliging member of the  staff.                                RECESS PRIVILEGES.    The number of persons to whom recess privileges were granted during the  recess, 1924-25, was 670, as against 740 in the previous year; the  latter number being exceptionally large owing to the greater length of  the recess in the earlier period.    The number of books lent to recess-privilege holders for the year  1924-25 was 6,135, as against 6,587 in the previous recess period. As a  rule, the class of books taken out by recess-privilege holders (and  here it may be noted that the New Zealand General Assembly Library is  the only legislative library in the world from which volumes may be  taken out during the recess) is of such a character as proves that the  privilege is greatly valued by the best class of readers.    No fiction, it should again be recorded, is lent out save to members of  Parliament, and those on the full-privilege list--a relatively small  number.    A detailed list showing the professions, trades, occupations, &c., of  those to whom the recess privileges are granted is at the disposal of  members.    During the recess, I regret to say, it has been found that a few plates  were purloined from art and other magazines, and cuttings made in the  newspaper files. Whenever a case of this kind is detected, an  attempt--unfortunately up to now abortive--has been made to detect the  offender, and the art magazines are now filed in the staff-room, and  not issued to those who use the Library during the recess, save members  of Parliament. On the whole, however, the cases of vandalism are  exceedingly few, and it gives me pleasure to testify to the care and  good usage which is almost uniformly displayed by those who are  honoured by being granted the recess privileges.                                  STOCK-TAKING.    As usual, stock-taking was proceeded with during the recess, the  classes dealt with being Class 910-919 (Voyages and Travels) and Class  920-929 (Biography, Memoirs, &c.). Mr. W. F. Johnson, who conducted  this particular work with great care, furnishes the following report:--    \"I have the honour to report that, with Mr. Dighton, I have completed  the stock-taking of the two classes mentioned above, with results as  follows:--    \"Class 910-919 (Voyages and Travels): This class--one of the largest in  the Library--was last taken stock of in the year 1918, when twenty-two  volumes were reported missing. Since that date 419 volumes have been  added to this class, making the total number in this section 5,326. The  result of this stock-taking shows that eleven volumes were  unaccounted-for, a list of which is appended.    \"Class 920-929 (Biography, &c.): This class also was last taken in  1918, when fourteen volumes were reported as missing. Since that time  360 volumes have been added to this class, making the total number in  this section 4,157. At this stock-taking the number unaccounted-for is  twenty-two, several of which are quite recent accessions to the  Library. It is difficult to believe that many of these books are lost  to the Library, as, of the fourteen reported lost at last stock-taking,  several were found in their places upon the shelves. The utmost care  has been taken in verifying the stock-sheets with the registers, and  with checking the volumes themselves. A list of books not accounted for  in each class is appended hereto, and I hand you herewith the working  stock-sheets.\"                                    BINDING.    There must always be a certain degree of wear-and-tear upon the  volumes, either those used during the session or during the recess; and  there are unquestionably a large number of volumes in the Library which  urgently stand in need of being rebound, rebacked, or otherwise  repaired. The number, too, of periodicals of various kinds, the back  numbers of which are of great value to members, has largely increased  of late years, and, as a substantially increased charge is now made for  binding, the annual vote for this purpose is being found markedly  inadequate. A large number of magazines have been withdrawn from the  binding-list, but the enormous increase in the number of books,  periodicals, pamphlets, &c., and the files of newspapers, which  certainly should be bound if the Library is to meet the requirements of  members, has certainly made the position much more serious. In view of  the increased cost of binding, the existing annual vote can only be  regarded as insufficient, and I would respectfully plead for a fairly  substantial increase.                                  MISCELLANEOUS.    The correspondence of the Library has quite materially increased in  volume. Inquiries from all parts of the Dominion for information as to  the value of certain rare books, requests for assistance in literary  matters, and on questions relative to the Copyright Act, have involved  considerable work, Mr. W. F. Johnson having rendered valuable aid in  assisting the Chief Librarian in this matter.    Officials of various State Departments continue to make considerable  use of the Library during the recess, and in several instances have  acknowledged the assistance rendered them in their researches by the  Library staff.    The usual monthly lists of accessions have been sent out during the  recess.    I have to express my thanks to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the  Joint Library Committee (the Hon. the Speaker of the House of  Representatives and J. McC. Dickson, Esq., M.P.), and to the Chairman  and Deputy Chairman of the Recess Library Committee (the Hon. the  Speaker and the Hon. Dr. Collins, M.L.C.) for the attention these  gentlemen have given the Library matters during the year; also to the  High"]]]
