PROCTOR      AUTHOR OF      \"ROUGH WAYS MADE SMOOTH,\" \"THE EXPANSE OF HEAVEN,\" \"OUR PLACE    AMONG INFINITIES,\" \"PLEASANT WAYS IN SCIENCE,\"    ETC., ETC.      _NEW EDITION_      LONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO.    LONDON, NEW YORK, AND BOMBAY    1896            _Printed by_ BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO      _At the Ballantyne Press_          PREFACE.      The chief charm of Astronomy, with many, does not reside in the wonders  revealed to us by the science, but in the lore and legends connected  with its history, the strange fancies with which in old times it has  been associated, the half-forgotten myths to which it has given birth.  In our own times also, Astronomy has had its myths and fancies, its wild  inventions, and startling paradoxes. My object in the present series of  papers has been to collect together the most interesting of these old  and new Astronomical myths, associating with them, in due proportion,  some of the chief marvels which recent Astronomy has revealed to us. To  the former class belong the subjects of the first four and the last five  essays of the present series, while the remaining essays belong to the  latter category.    Throughout I have endeavoured to avoid technical expressions on the one  hand, and ambiguous phraseology (sometimes resulting from the attempt  to avoid technicality) on the other. I have, in fact, sought to present  my subjects as I should wish to have matters outside the range of my  special branch of study presented for my own reading.      RICHARD A. PROCTOR.

Astrology possesses a real interest even in these days. It is true that  no importance attaches now even to the discussion of the considerations  which led to the rejection of judicial astrology. None but the most  ignorant, and therefore superstitious, believe at present in divination  of any sort or kind whatsoever. Divination by the stars holds no higher  position than palmistry, fortune-telling by cards, or the indications of  the future which foolish persons find in dreams, tea-dregs,  salt-spilling, and other absurdities. But there are two reasons which  render the history of astrology interesting. In the first place, faith  in stellar influences was once so widespread that astrological  terminology came to form a part of ordinary language, insomuch that it  is impossible rightly to understand many passages of ancient and  mediaeval literature, or rightly to apprehend the force of many allusions  and expressions, unless the significance of astrological teachings to  the men of those times be recognised. In the second place, it is  interesting to examine how the erroneous teachings of astrology were  gradually abandoned, to note the way in which various orders of mind  rejected these false doctrines or struggled to retain them, and to  perceive how, with a large proportion of even the most civilised races,  the superstitions of judicial astrology were long retained, or are  retained even to this very day. The world has still to see some  superstitions destroyed which are as widely received as astrology ever  was, and which will probably retain their influence over many minds long  after the reasoning portion of the community have rejected them.    Even so far back as the time of Eudoxus the pretensions of astrologers  were rejected, as Cicero informs us ('De Div.' ii. 42). And though the  Romans were strangely superstitious in such matters, Cicero reasons with  excellent judgment against the belief in astrology. Gassendi quotes the  argument drawn by Cicero against astrology, from the predictions of the  Chaldaeans that Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey would die 'in a full old age,  in their own houses, in peace and honour,' whose deaths, nevertheless,  were 'violent, immature, and tragical.' Cicero also used an argument  whose full force has only been recognised in modern times. 'What  contagion,' he asked, 'can reach us from the planets, whose distance is  almost infinite?' It is singular that Seneca, who was well acquainted  with the uniform character of the planetary motions, seems to have  entertained no doubt respecting their influence. Tacitus expresses some  doubts, but was on the whole inclined to believe in astrology.  'Certainly,' he says, 'the majority of mankind cannot be weaned from the  opinion that at the birth of each man his future destiny is fixed;  though some things may fall out differently from the predictions, by the  ignorance of those who profess the art; and thus the art is unjustly  blamed, confirmed as it is by noted examples in all ages.'[1]    Probably, the doubt suggested by the different fortunes and characters  of men born at the same time must have occurred to many before Cicero  dwelt upon it. Pliny, who followed Cicero in this, does not employ the  argument quite correctly, for he says that, 'in every hour, in every  part of the world, are born lords and slaves, kings and beggars.' But of  course, according to astrological principles, it would be necessary that  two persons, whose fortunes were to be alike, should be born, not only  in the same hour, but in the same place. The fortunes and character of  Jacob and Esau, however, should manifestly have been similar, which was  certainly not the case, if their history has been correctly handed down  to us. An astrologer of the time of Julius Caesar, named Publius Nigidius  Figulus, used a singular argument against such reasoning. When an  opponent urged the different fortunes of men born nearly at the same  instant, Nigidius asked him to make two contiguous marks on a potter's  wheel which was revolving rapidly. When the wheel was stopped, the two  marks were found to be far apart. Nigidius is said to have received the  name of Figulus (the potter), in remembrance of the story; but more  probably he was a potter by trade, and an astrologer only during those  leisure hours which he could devote to charlatanry. St. Augustine, who  relates the story (which I borrow from Whewell's 'History of the  Inductive Sciences'), says, justly, that the argument of Nigidius was as  fragile as the ware made on the potter's wheel.    The belief must have been all but universal in those days that at the  birth of any person who was to hold an important place in the world's  history the stars would either be ominously conjoined, or else some  blazing comet or new star would make its appearance. For we know that  some such object having appeared, or some unusual conjunction of planets  having occurred, near enough to the time of Christ's birth to be  associated in men's minds with that event, it came eventually to be  regarded as belonging to his horoscope, and as actually indicating to  the Wise Men of the East (Chaldaean astrologers, doubtless) the future  greatness of the child then born. It is certain that that is what the  story of the Star in the East means as it stands. Theologians differ as  to its interpretation in points of detail. Some think the phenomenon was  meteoric, others that a comet then made its appearance, others that a  new star shone out, and others that the account referred to a  conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars, which occurred at about that  time. As a matter of detail it may be mentioned, that none of these  explanations in the slightest degree corresponds with the account, for  neither meteor, nor comet, nor new star, nor conjoined planets, would go  before travellers from the east, to show them their way to any place.  Yet the ancients sometimes regarded comets as guides. Whichever view we  accept, it is abundantly clear that an astrological significance was  attached by the narrator to the event. And not so very long ago, when  astrologers first began to see that their occupation was passing from  them, the Wise Men of the East were appealed to against the enemies of  astrology,[2]--very much as Moses was appealed to against Copernicus  and Galileo, and more recently to protect us against certain  relationships which Darwin, Wallace, and Huxley unkindly indicate for  the human race divine.    Although astronomers now reject altogether the doctrines of judicial  astrology, it is impossible for the true lover of that science to regard  astrology altogether with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26558"],[0,"Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking (#1)"],[1,"Dutch Cooking                                         Dutchland                                Pennsylvania               [Illustration: Kissin wears out ... cookin' don't]                    Jacob's at the table and half et already                         PROVEN RECIPES FOR TRADITIONAL                          PENNSYLVANIA Dutch FOODS          [Illustration]    PENNSYLVANIA Dutch COOKERY      In 1683 the Plain Sects began to arrive in William Penn's Colony seeking  a land of peace and plenty. They were a mixed people; Moravians from  Bohemia and Moravia, Mennonites from Switzerland and Holland, the Amish,  the Dunkards, the Schwenkfelds, and the French Huguenots. After the lean  years of clearing the land and developing their farms they established  the peace and plenty they sought. These German-speaking people were  originally called the Pennsylvania Deutsch but time and custom have  caused them to be known to us as the Pennsylvania Dutch.    The Pennsylvania Dutch are a hard working people and as they say, \"Them  that works hard, eats hearty.\" The blending of recipes from their many  home lands and the ingredients available in their new land produced  tasty dishes that have been handed down from mother to daughter for  generations. Their cooking was truly a folk art requiring much intuitive  knowledge, for recipes contained measurements such as \"flour to  stiffen,\" \"butter the size of a walnut,\" and \"large as an apple.\" Many  of the recipes have been made more exact and standardized providing us  with a regional cookery we can all enjoy.    Soups are a traditional part of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking and the Dutch  housewife can apparently make soup out of anything. If she has only milk  and flour she can still make rivel soup. However, most of their soups  are sturdier dishes, hearty enough to serve as the major portion of the  evening meal. One of the favorite summer soups in the Pennsylvania Dutch  country is Chicken Corn Soup. Few Sunday School picnic suppers would be  considered complete without gallons of this hearty soup.    Many of the Pennsylvania Dutch foods are a part of their folklore. No  Shrove Tuesday would be complete without raised doughnuts called  \"fastnachts.\" One of the many folk tales traces this custom back to the  burnt offerings made by their old country ancestors to the goddess of  spring. With the coming of Christianity the custom became associated  with the Easter season and \"fastnachts\" are eaten on Shrove Tuesday to  insure living to next Shrove Tuesday. Young dandelion greens are eaten  on Maundy Thursday in order to remain well throughout the year.    The Christmas season is one of the busiest times in the Pennsylvania  Dutch kitchen. For weeks before Christmas the house is filled with the  smell of almond cookies, anise cookies, sandtarts, Belsnickle Christmas  cookies, walnut kisses, pfeffernusse, and other traditional cookies. Not  just a few of one kind but dozens and dozens of many kinds of cookies  must be made. There must be plenty for the enjoyment of the family and  many holiday visitors.    Regardless of the time of the year or the time of the day there are  pies. The Pennsylvania Dutch eat pies for breakfast. They eat pies for  lunch. They eat pies for dinner and they eat pies for midnight snacks.  Pies are made with a great variety of ingredients from the apple pie we  all know to the rivel pie which is made from flour, sugar, and butter.  The Dutch housewife is as generous with her pies as she is with all her  cooking, baking six or eight at a time not one and two.    The apple is an important Pennsylvania Dutch food. Dried apples form the  basis for many typical dishes. Each fall barrels of apples are converted  into cider. Apple butter is one of the Pennsylvania Dutch foods which  has found national acceptance. The making of apple butter is an all-day  affair and has the air of a holiday to it. Early in the morning the  neighbors gather and begin to peel huge piles of apples that will be  needed. Soon the great copper apple butter kettle is brought out and set  up over a wood fire. Apple butter requires constant stirring to prevent  burning. However, stirring can be light work for a boy and a girl when  they're young and the day is bright and the world is full of promise. By  dusk the apple butter is made, neighborhood news is brought up to date  and hunger has been driven that much further away for the coming winter.    Food is abundant and appetites are hearty in the Pennsylvania Dutch  country. The traditional dishes are relatively simple and unlike most  regional cookery the ingredients are readily available. Best of all, no  matter who makes them the results are \"wonderful good.\"          PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH    [Illustration: \"Make with a smile for once\"    \"Some folks are wonderful nice\"]    Salads      FRUIT SALAD DRESSING      1/2 cup sugar    1-1/2 tblsp. flour    2 eggs    1/2 cup pineapple juice    1/2 cup lemon juice    1 cup whipped cream    Combine the fruit juices and stir slowly into the flour and sugar.
