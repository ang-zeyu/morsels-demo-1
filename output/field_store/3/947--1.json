Ad practicam spectant Artes omnes Manuales, a  quibus utiq; _Mechanica_ nomen mutuata est. Cum autem Artifices parum  accurate operari soleant, fit ut _Mechanica_ omnis a _Geometria_ ita  distinguatur, ut quicquid accuratum sit ad _Geometriam_ referatur, quicquid  minus accuratum ad _Mechanicam_. Attamen errores non sunt Artis sed  Artificum. Qui minus accurate operatur, imperfectior est Mechanicus, & si  quis accuratissime operari posset, hic foret Mechanicus omnium  perfectissimus. Nam & Linearum rectarum & Circulorum descriptiones in  quibus _Geometria_ fundatur, ad _Mechanicam_ pertinent. Has lineas  describere _Geometria_ non docet sed postulat. Postulat enim ut Tyro easdem  accurate describere prius didicerit quam limen attingat _Geometriæ_; dein,  quomodo per has operationes Problemata solvantur, docet. Rectas & circulos  describere Problemata sunt sed non Geometrica. Ex _Mechanica_ postulatur  horum solutio, in _Geometria_ docetur solutorum usus. Ac gloriatur  _Geometria_ quod tam paucis principiis aliunde petitis tam multa præstet.  Fundatur igitur _Geometria_ in praxi Mechanica, & nihil aliud est quam  _Mechanicæ universalis_ pars illa quæ artem mensurandi accurate proponit ac  demonstrat. Cum autem artes Manuales in corporibus movendis præcipue  versentur, fit ut _Geometria_ ad magnitudinem, _Mechanica_ ad motum vulgo  reseratur. Quo sensu _Mechanica rationalis_ erit Scientia Motuum qui ex  viribus quibuscunq; resultant, & virium quæ ad motus quoscunq; requiruntur,  accurate proposita ac demonstrata. Pars hæc _Mechanicæ_ a Veteribus in  _Potentiis quinque_ ad artes manuales spectantibus exculta fuit, qui  Gravitatem (cum potentia manualis non sit) vix aliter quam in ponderibus  per potentias illas movendis considerarunt. Nos autem non Artibus sed  Philosophiæ consulentes, deq; potentiis non manualibus sed naturalibus  scribentes, ea maxime tractamus quæ ad Gravitatem, levitatem, vim  Elasticam, resistentiam Fluidorum & ejusmodi vires seu attractivas seu  impulsivas spectant: Et ea propter hæc nostra tanquam Philosophiæ principia  Mathematica proponimus. Omnis enim Philosophiæ difficultas in eo versari  videtur, ut a Phænomenis motuum investigemus vires Naturæ, deinde ab his  viribus demonstremus phænomena reliqua. Et hac spectant Propositiones  generales quas Libro primo & secundo pertractavimus. In Libro autem tertio  exemplum hujus rei proposuimus per explicationem Systematis mundani. Ibi  enim, ex phænomenis cælestibus, per Propositiones in Libris prioribus  Mathematice demonstratas, derivantur vires gravitatis quibus corpora ad  Solem & Planetas singulos tendunt. Deinde ex his viribus per Propositiones  etiam Mathematicas deducuntur motus Planetarum, Cometarum, Lunæ & Maris.  Utinam cætera Naturæ phænomena ex principiis Mechanicis eodem argumentandi  genere derivare liceret. Nam multa me movent ut nonnihil suspicer ea omnia  ex viribus quibusdam pendere posse, quibus corporum particulæ per causas  nondum cognitas vel in se mutuo impelluntur & secundum figuras regulares  cohærent, vel ab invicem fugantur & recedunt: quibus viribus ignotis,  Philosophi hactenus Naturam frustra tentarunt. Spero autem quod vel huic  Philosophandi modo, vel veriori alicui, Principia hic posita lucem aliquam  præbebunt._    _In his edendis, Vir acutissimus & in omni literarum genere eruditissimus  _Edmundus Halleius_ operam navavit, nec solum Typothetarum Sphalmata  correxit & Schemata incidi curavit, sed etiam Author fuit ut horum  editionem aggrederer.

At postquam Motuum Lunarium  inæqualitates aggressus essem, deinde etiam alia tentare cæpissem quæ ad  leges mensuras Gravitatis & aliarum virium, ad figuras a corporibus  secundum datas quascunque leges attractis describendas, ad motus corporum  plurium inter se, ad motus corporum in Mediis resistentibus, ad vires,  densitates & motus Mediorum, ad Orbes Cometarum & similia spectant,  editionem in aliud tempus differendam esse putavi, ut cætera rimarer & una  in publicum darem.

A new era  has dawned, not by chronological prescription alone, but to the vital  sense of humanity. Novel thoughts are rife; fresh impulses stir the  nations; the soughing of the wind of progress strikes every ear. \"The  old order changeth\" more and more swiftly as mental activity becomes  intensified. Already many of the scientific doctrines implicitly  accepted fifteen years ago begin to wear a superannuated aspect.  Dalton's atoms are in process of disintegration; Kirchhoff's theorem  visibly needs to be modified; Clerk Maxwell's medium no longer figures  as an indispensable factotum; \"absolute zero\" is known to be situated on  an asymptote to the curve of cold. Ideas, in short, have all at once  become plastic, and none more completely so than those relating to  astronomy. The physics of the heavenly bodies, indeed, finds its best  opportunities in unlooked-for disclosures; for it deals with  transcendental conditions, and what is strange to terrestrial experience  may serve admirably to expound what is normal in the skies. In celestial  science especially, facts that appear subversive are often the most  illuminative, and the prospect of its advance widens and brightens with  each divagation enforced or permitted from the strait paths of rigid  theory.    This readiness for innovation has undoubtedly its dangers and drawbacks.  To the historian, above all, it presents frequent occasions of  embarrassment. The writing of history is a strongly selective operation,  the outcome being valuable just in so far as the choice what to reject  and what to include has been judicious; and the task is no light one of  discriminating between barren speculations and ideas pregnant with  coming truth. To the possession of such prescience of the future as  would be needed to do this effectually I can lay no claim; but diligence  and sobriety of thought are ordinarily within reach, and these I shall  have exercised to good purpose if I have succeeded in rendering the  fourth edition of _A Popular History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth  Century_ not wholly unworthy of a place in the scientific literature of  the twentieth century.    My thanks are due to Sir David Gill for the use of his photograph of the  great comet of 1901, which I have added to my list of illustrations, and  to the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society for the loan of glass  positives needed for the reproduction of those included in the third  edition.    London, _July_, 1902.        PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION    The progress of astronomy during the last hundred years has been rapid  and extraordinary. In its distinctive features, moreover, the nature of  that progress has been such as to lend itself with facility to  untechnical treatment. To this circumstance the present volume owes its  origin. It embodies an attempt to enable the ordinary reader to follow,  with intelligent interest, the course of modern astronomical inquiries,  and to realize (so far as it can at present be realized) the full effect  of the comprehensive change in the whole aspect, purposes, and methods  of celestial science introduced by the momentous discovery of spectrum  analysis.    Since Professor Grant's invaluable work on the _History of Physical  Astronomy_ was published, a third of a century has elapsed. During the  interval a so-called \"new astronomy\" has grown up by the side of the  old. One effect of its advent has been to render the science of the  heavenly bodies more popular, both in its needs and in its nature, than  formerly. More popular in its needs, since its progress now primarily  depends upon the interest in, and consequent efforts towards its  advancement of the general public; more popular in its nature, because  the kind of knowledge it now chiefly tends to accumulate is more easily  intelligible--less remote from ordinary experience--than that evolved by  the aid of the calculus from materials collected by the use of the  transit-instrument and chronograph.    It has thus become practicable to describe in simple language the most  essential parts of recent astronomical discoveries, and, being  practicable, it could not be otherwise than desirable to do so. The  service to astronomy itself would be not inconsiderable of enlisting  wider sympathies on its behalf, while to help one single mind towards a  fuller understanding of the manifold works which have in all ages  irresistibly spoken to man of the glory of God might well be an object  of no ignoble ambition.    The present volume does not profess to be a complete or exhaustive  history of astronomy during the period covered by it. Its design is to  present a view of the progress of celestial science, on its most  characteristic side, since the time of Herschel. Abstruse mathematical  theories, unless in some of their more striking results, are excluded  from consideration. These, during the eighteenth century, constituted  the sum and substance of astronomy, and their fundamental importance can  never be diminished, and should never be ignored. But as the outcome of  the enormous development given to the powers of the telescope in recent  times, together with the swift advance of physical science, and the  inclusion, by means of the spectroscope, of the heavenly bodies within  the domain of its inquiries, much knowledge has been acquired regarding  the nature and condition of those bodies, forming, it might be said, a  science apart, and disembarrassed from immediate dependence upon  intricate, and, except to the initiated, unintelligible formulae. This  kind of knowledge forms the main subject of the book now offered to the  public.    There are many reasons for preferring a history to a formal treatise on  astronomy. In a treatise, _what_ we know is set forth. A history tells  us, in addition, _how_ we came to know it. It thus places facts before  us in the natural order of their ascertainment, and narrates instead of  enumerating. The story to be told leaves the marvels of imagination far  behind, and requires no embellishment from literary art or high-flown  phrases. Its best ornament is unvarnished truthfulness, and this, at  least, may confidently be claimed to be bestowed upon it in the ensuing  pages.    In them unity of treatment is sought to be combined with a due regard to  chronological sequence by grouping in separate chapters the various  events relating to the several departments of descriptive astronomy. The  whole is divided into two parts, the line between which is roughly drawn  at the middle of the present century. Herschel's inquiries into the  construction of the heavens strike the keynote of the first part; the  discoveries of sun-spot and magnetic periodicity and of spectrum  analysis determine the character of the second. Where the nature of the  subject required it, however, this arrangement has been disregarded.  Clearness and consistency should obviously take precedence of method.  Thus, in treating of the telescopic scrutiny of the various planets, the  whole of the related facts have been collected into an uninterrupted  narrative. A division elsewhere natural and helpful would here have been  purely artificial, and therefore confusing.    The interests of students have been consulted by a full and authentic  system of references to the sources of information relied upon.  Materials have been derived, as a rule with very few exceptions, from  the original authorities. The system adopted has been to take as little  as possible at second-hand. Much pains have been taken to trace the  origin of ideas, often obscurely enunciated long before they came to  resound through the scientific world, and to give to each individual  discoverer, strictly and impartially, his due. Prominence has also been  assigned to the biographical element, as underlying and determining the  whole course of human endeavour. The advance of knowledge may be called  a vital process. The lives of men are absorbed into and assimilated by  it. Inquiries into the kind and mode of the surrender in each separate  case must always possess a strong interest, whether for study or for  example.    The acknowledgments of the writer are due to Professor Edward S. Holden,  director of the Washburn Observatory, Wisconsin, and to Dr. Copeland,  chief astronomer of Lord Crawford's Observatory at Dunecht, for many  valuable communications.    London,"]]]
