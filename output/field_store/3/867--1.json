THE    INTERNATIONAL    MONTHLY    MAGAZINE    Of Literature, Science, and Art.      VOLUME III.    APRIL TO JULY, 1851.      NEW-YORK:    STRINGER & TOWNSEND, 222 BROADWAY.    FOR SALE BY ALL BOOKSELLERS.    BY THE NUMBER, 25 Cts.; THE VOLUME, $1; THE YEAR, $3.      Transcriber's note: Contents for entire volume 3 in this text. However  this text contains only issue Vol. 3, No. 1. Minor typos have been  corrected and footnotes moved to the end of the article.          PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.      The INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE has now been published one year, with a  constantly increasing sale, and, it is believed, with a constantly  increasing good reputation. The publishers are satisfied with its  success, and will apply all the means at their disposal to increase its  value and preserve its position. They have recently made such  arrangements in London as will insure to the editor the use of advance  sheets of the most important new English publications, and besides all  the leading miscellanies of literature printed on the continent, have  engaged eminent persons as correspondents, in Paris, Berlin, and other  cities, so that _The International_ will more fully than hitherto  reflect the literary movement of the world.    In wit and humor and romance, the most legitimate and necessary  components of the popular magazine, as great a variety will be furnished  as can be gleaned from the best contemporary foreign publications, and  at the same time several conspicuous writers will contribute original  papers. In the last year _The International_ has been enriched with new  articles by Mr. G. P. R. James, Henry Austen Layard, LL.D., Bishop  Spencer, Mr. Bayard Taylor, Mr. R. H. Stoddard, Mr. Parke Godwin, Mr.  John R. Thompson, Mr. Alfred B. Street, Mr. W. C. Richards, Dr. Starbuck  Mayo, Mr. John E. Warren, Mr. George Ripley, Mr. A. O. Hall, Mr. Richard  B. Kimball, Mrs. E. Oakes Smith, Mrs. Mary E. Hewitt, Miss Alice Carey,  Miss Cooper (the author of \"Rural Hours\"), and many others, constituting  a list hardly less distinguished than the most celebrated magazines in  the language have boasted in their best days; this list of contributors  will be worthily enlarged hereafter, and the Historical Review, the  Record of Scientific Discovery, the monthly Biographical Notices of  eminent Persons deceased, will be continued, with a degree of care that  will render _The International_ of the highest value as a repository of  contemporary facts.    When it is considered that periodical literature now absorbs the best  compositions of the great lights of learning and literary art throughout  the world,--that Bulwer, Dickens, James, Thackeray, Macaulay, Talfourd,  Tennyson, Browning, and persons of corresponding rank in France,  Germany, and other countries, address the public through reviews,  magazines, and newspapers--the value of such an \"abstract and brief  chronicle\" as it is endeavored to present in _The International_, to  every one who would maintain a reputation for intelligence, or who is  capable of intellectual enjoyment, will readily be admitted. It is  trusted that while these pages will commend themselves to the best  judgments, they will gratify the general tastes, and that they will in  no instance contain a thought or suggest a feeling inconsistent with the  highest refinement and virtue.
