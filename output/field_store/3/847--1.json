How best to perform construction work and what it will cost for  materials, labor, plant and general expenses are matters of vital  interest to engineers and contractors. This book is a treatise on the  methods and cost of concrete construction. No attempt has been made to  present the subject of cement testing which is already covered by Mr. W.  Purves Taylor's excellent book, nor to discuss the physical properties  of cements and concrete, as they are discussed by Falk and by Sabin, nor  to consider reinforced concrete design as do Turneaure and Maurer or  Buel and Hill, nor to present a general treatise on cements, mortars and  concrete construction like that of Reid or of Taylor and Thompson. On  the contrary, the authors have handled the subject of concrete  construction solely from the viewpoint of the builder of concrete  structures. By doing this they have been able to crowd a great amount of  detailed information on methods and costs of concrete construction into  a volume of moderate size.    Though the special information contained in the book is of most  particular assistance to the contractor or engineer engaged in the  actual work of making and placing concrete, it is believed that it will  also prove highly useful to the designing engineer and to the architect.  It seems plain that no designer of concrete structures can be a really  good designer without having a profound knowledge of methods of  construction and of detailed costs. This book, it is believed, gives  these methods and cost data in greater number and more thoroughly  analyzed than they can be found elsewhere in engineering literature.    The costs and other facts contained in the book have been collected from  a multitude of sources, from the engineering journals, from the  transactions of the engineering societies, from Government Reports and  from the personal records of the authors and of other engineers and  contractors. It is but fair to say that the great bulk of the matter  contained in the book, though portions of it have appeared previously  in other forms in the authors' contributions to the technical press, was  collected and worked up originally by the authors. Where this has not  been the case the original data have been added to and re-analyzed by  the authors. Under these circumstances it has been impracticable to give  specific credit in the pages of the book to every source from which the  authors have drawn aid. They wish here to acknowledge, therefore, the  help secured from many engineers and contractors, from the volumes of  Engineering News, Engineering Record and Engineering-Contracting, and  from the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the  proceedings and papers of various other civil engineering societies and  organizations of concrete workers. The work done by these journals and  societies in gathering and publishing information on concrete  construction is of great and enduring value and deserves full  acknowledgment.    In answer to any possible inquiry as to the relative parts of the work  done by the two authors in preparing this book, they will answer that it  has been truly the labor of both in every part.

Evidently the message was puzzling. Again Mr. Clark read it.  Donald wondered what it could be. All the afternoon the yellow envelope  had been on the table, and more than once his mind had wandered from the  lessons he was preparing to speculate on the possible tidings wrapped  up in that sealed packet. Not that a telegram was an unheard-of event in  the family. No, his father received many; most of them, however, went to  the Boston office, and the boy could not imagine what this one was doing  at their Cambridge home.    The moment his father entered the house Donald handed him the envelope  and Mr. Clark quickly stripped it open; yet even though it now lay  spread out before him the mystery it contained appeared to be unsolved.  It was seldom that Donald asked questions, nevertheless he found himself  wondering and wondering what it was that had brought that odd little  wrinkle into his father's forehead. Donald understood that wrinkle; he  had seen it many times and knew it never came unless some question arose  to which it was difficult to frame an answer. As his father and he had  lived alone together ever since he could remember they had grown to know  each other very well, and had become the best of friends. It therefore  followed that when one worried, both worried.    As the boy looked on, his father glanced up suddenly and caught sight  of the anxiety mirrored in his face. The man smiled kindly.    \"I can find no answer to this riddle, Don,\" he said. \"Listen! Perhaps  you can help me. A few days ago I received word from Crescent Ranch that  Johnson, our manager, had been thrown from his horse while out on the  range and so badly hurt that he will never again be able to continue his  work with us. They have taken him to the hospital at Glen City. The  letter came from Tom Thornton, the head herder at the ranch. Thornton  assured me that everything was going well, and that there was not the  slightest need for me to come to Idaho.\"    Donald listened.    \"Well, to-day I received this telegram. It is neither from Johnson nor  Thornton. It reads:    \"'You would do well to visit Crescent Ranch,' and it is signed--'Sandy  McCulloch.'\"    \"Who is Sandy McCulloch?\" asked Donald.    \"That's the puzzle! I do not know. I never heard of any such person in  my life--not that I remember. Evidently, though, he knows enough about  me to know that I own that sheep ranch, and to think that I ought to go  out there and see it. I do not understand it at all. What do you make of  it, son?\"    Donald thought carefully.    \"Do you suppose anything is wrong on the ranch?\"    \"No, indeed! Thornton wrote particularly that everything was all right.  He was Johnson's assistant, and he ought to know. Besides, he has been  with us a long time, and is thoroughly familiar with every part of the  work.\"    \"Maybe it's a joke,\" ventured Donald.    \"It would be a stupid sort of joke to get me from Boston to Idaho on a  wild-goose chase. No, there is no joke about this,\" went on Mr. Clark,  rising and pacing the floor. \"Sandy McCulloch is real, and he has some  real reason for wanting me to go to Crescent Ranch. I think I shall take  his advice and go.\"    Donald was astounded. His father never left home.    \"And the office?\"    \"Uncle Harold will have to do double duty while I am gone.\"    \"And--and--I?\" inquired the boy hesitatingly.    Idaho seemed very far away--quite at the other end of the world.    \"You? Oh, you'll have to go along too! I shall need you.\"    Donald drew a long breath.    \"Let me see,\" continued his father, \"this is the end of March, isn't it?  Your spring term is about over. I happen to know you are well up in your  work, for I met Mr. Hurlbert, the high school principal, only yesterday.  I am sure that if you fall behind by going on this trip you will study  all the harder to make up the work when you get back, won't you?\"    \"Yes, sir!\" was the emphatic promise.    \"You see I've no idea how long I shall be detained out West, therefore I  have no mind to leave you here. You might be ill. Besides, I should miss  you, Don.\"    \"I'd much rather go with you, father.\"    A quick light of pleasure flashed in the father's eyes.    \"Then that's settled,\" he exclaimed decisively. \"Now I'll tell you what I  mean to do. I am not going to wire Crescent Ranch that we are coming.  Instead we will drop down and surprise them. It won't take long to see  how things are running, and even if it proves that everything is all  right I shall not begrudge the trip, for I have felt for some time that  I ought to go. Clark & Sons have owned that ranch for thirty years, and  yet I have never been near it. It certainly is time I went.\"    \"How did it happen you never did go, father?\"    \"Well, during your grandfather's life an old Scotchman managed the ranch  and attended to shipping the wool. As we had nothing to do but to sell  it, we did not bother much about the place, for we had perfect  confidence in Old Angus, the manager. After your grandfather died, Uncle  Harold and I had all we could do to attend to the business here. It grew  so rapidly that it was about as much as two young fellows like ourselves  could handle. We always meant to go out--one of us--but we never did.  Then our faithful Scotchman died. We felt lost, I can tell you! He had  had all the management of Crescent for twenty years and was one of the  finest men in the world. He might have lived until now, perhaps, had he  not been caught on the range in a blizzard while struggling to get a  flock of sheep out of the storm and thereby lost his life.\"    Mr. Clark paused a moment.    \"After him came Johnson. He has done his work well, so far as we know;  but now he is out of the running too and we shall have to get some one  else.\"    \"Whom are you going to get?\"    \"I haven't the most remote idea. You see, Don, I know next to nothing  about managing a ranch. I stay here in Boston and simply sell wool. This  end of the business I know thoroughly, but the other end is Greek to  me.\"    Donald laughed. He was just beginning Greek.    \"I am glad you don't know about a ranch, father,\" he exclaimed.    \"Why?\"    \"Oh, because you seem to know almost everything else, and it is fun to  find something you don't know.\"    There was admiration in the boy's words.    His father shook his head and there was a shadow of sadness in his smile  as he replied:    \"I know very little, Donald boy. The older I grow the less I know, too.  You will feel that way when you are my age. Now here is a chance for us  to learn something together. Let's go to Idaho and find out all we can  about sheep-raising.\"    Within the next few days the plans for the journey were completed.    As one article after another was purchased and packed the trip unfolded  into a most alluring pilgrimage. They must take their riding togs, for  Uncle Harold reminded them that they would probably be in the saddle  much of the time; their camping kit must go also; above all they must  carry good revolvers and rifles. Donald's heart beat high. He and his  father had always ridden a great deal together; it was their favorite  sport. Now they were to have whole days of it. And added to this  pleasure was the crowning glory of both a rifle and a revolver!    All this fairy-land of the future had come about through Sandy  McCulloch!    Who was this wonderful Sandy? And why had he telegraphed?    Sandy McCulloch! The very name breathed a charm. Donald repeated it to  himself constantly. He dreamed dreams and wove adventures about this  mysterious Scotchman. He knew he should like Sandy. Who could help it?  His name was enough.    In the meantime the days of preparation flew by. Donald's spring  examinations were passed with honors--a fact which his father declared  proved that he had taken his work in earnest and that he deserved an  outing. Mr. Clark laughingly ventured the hope that he should be able to  leave his business affairs in equally good condition.    \"You have set quite a pace for me, Don! I am not sure whether I can take  honors at the office or not. I have done the best I could, however, to  put things into Uncle Harold's hands so to cause him as little trouble  as possible.\"    Donald tried not to become"]]]
