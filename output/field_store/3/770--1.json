PREFACE    TO THE TENTH EDITION      In the revision of this well-known work I have held my hand, rather than  the contrary, trying to bear always in mind that it was the hand-book of  Mr. Charles Boutell and not a production of my own. My alterations have  been concerned chiefly in bringing the volume up to date, a necessity  imposed by the creation of new orders of knighthood, and change of  Sovereign. I have certainly omitted a few remarks which I have thought  might be the cause of leading students of the science astray: I have  altered ambiguous wording to emphasise the real, and I have no doubt the  originally intended meaning. But in many points which, being deductions,  are naturally matters of opinion, I have left herein various expressions  of Mr. Boutell's opinion, with which I can hardly say I personally  altogether agree or would myself put forward. I hold that it is no part  of an editor's duty to air his own opinions under the protection or  repute of another's name, and herein I have inserted nothing for which  my own opinion is the only authority.

No. 3.--St. Edmund.]          AUTHOR'S PREFACE      This Volume, specially prepared for the use of students at an early  period of their study of English Heraldry, commends itself also to those  inquirers who may desire to obtain some general information on the same  subject, without having any intention to devote to Heraldry much either  of their time or of their serious regard.    The success, no less extraordinary than gratifying, of my larger work on  Heraldry, led me to hope that a not less favourable reception might be  extended to a simpler and much shorter essay, more decidedly elementary  in its aim and character, and yet as far as possible within its limits  complete. Such a treatise I have endeavoured to produce in this Volume.    Inseparably associated with the History of our Country, and more  particularly when our national History becomes the Biography of eminent  Englishmen, English Heraldry has the strongest claims upon the attention  not only of all Historians, but also of all who desire to become  familiar with their writings. In like manner, Heraldry may be studied  with no less of advantage than of satisfaction by all Artists, whether  Architects, Sculptors, Painters, or Engravers. Nor is it too much to  assert that some knowledge of Heraldry, in consequence of its singular  and comprehensive utility, ought to be estimated as a necessary element  of a liberal education. In confirmation of my own views, I am tempted to  quote the following passage from M. GOURDON DE GENOUILLAC'S introduction  to his excellent \"Grammaire Héraldique,\" published at Paris:-- \"Le  blason,\" says M. de Genouillac, \"est une langue qui s'est conservée dans  sa pureté primitive depuis les siècles, langue dont la connaissance, est  indispensable aux familles nobles, qui y trouvent un signe d'alliance ou  de reconnaissance, aux numismates, aux antiquaires, aux archéologues,  enfin à tous les artistes, gens de lettres, &c.; cependant cette langue  est presque inconnue, et la plupart des personnes qui possedent le droit  de porter des armoiries seraient fort en peine de les expliquer selon  les termes techniques!\" Heraldry, indeed, I believe to be a study worthy  to be universally regarded with affectionate respect, as it certainly is  eminently qualified to inspire such a sentiment in every class of  student.    In this spirit I have here treated the elements of the Heraldry of  England, confident that, of those who may accompany me as far as I shall  lead them, very many will not be content to stop where I shall take  leave of them. Thus much I promise my companions--I will be to them a  faithful guide. They may trust to my accuracy. I have made no statement,  have adduced no example, nor have I exhibited any illustration, except  upon authority. I myself like and admire what is real and true in  Heraldry; and it is by the attractiveness of truth and reality that I  desire to win for Heraldry fresh friends, and to secure for it firm  friendships.    It will be understood that from the authority, the practice, and the  associations of the early Heraldry of the best and most artistic eras,  I seek to derive a Heraldry which we may rightly consider to be our own,  and which we may transmit with honour to our successors. I do not  suggest the adoption, for present use, of an obsolete system. But, while  I earnestly repudiate the acceptance and the maintenance amongst  ourselves of a most degenerate substitute for a noble Science, I do  aspire to aid in restoring HERALDRY to its becoming rank, and  consequently to its early popularity, now in our own times. This is to  revive the fine old Heraldry of the past, to give to it a fresh  animation, and to apply it under existing conditions to existing uses  and requirements: not, to adjust ourselves to the circumstances of its  first development, and to reproduce as copyists its original  expressions. It is not by any means a necessary condition of a  consistent revival of early Heraldry, that our revived Heraldry should  admit no deviation from original usage or precedent. So long as we are  thoroughly animated by the spirit of the early Heralds, we may lead our  Heraldry onwards with the advance of time. It is for us, indeed, to  prepare a Heraldry for the future, no less than to revive true Heraldry  in the time now present. We may rightly modify, therefore, and adapt  many things, in order to establish a true conformity between our  Heraldry and the circumstances of our own era: for example, with  advantage as well as propriety we may, in a great measure, substitute  Badges for Crests; and we shall do well to adopt a style of drawing  which will be perfectly heraldic, without being positively unnatural.    The greater number of my Illustrations have been engraved only in  outline, with the twofold object of my being thus enabled to increase  the number of the examples, and to adapt the engravings themselves to  the reception of colour. It will be very desirable for students to  blazon the illustrations, or the majority of them, in their proper  tinctures: and those who are thoroughly in earnest will not fail to form  their own collections of additional examples, which, as a matter of  course, they will seek to obtain from original authorities. With the  exception of a few examples, my Illustrations, considerably over 400,  have all been executed expressly for this work; and they all have been  engraved by Mr. R. B. UTTING. The chief exceptions are thirteen  admirable woodcuts of Scottish Seals, all of them good illustrations of  Heraldry south of the Tweed, originally engraved for Laing's noble  quarto upon \"The Ancient Seals of Scotland,\" published in Edinburgh.  Scottish Heraldry, I must add, as in any particulars of law and practice  it may differ from our Heraldry on this side of the Tweed, I have left  in the able hands of the Heralds of the North: at the same time,  however, the Heraldry of which I have been treating has so much that is  equally at home on either side of \"the Border,\" that I have never  hesitated to look for my examples and authorities to both the fair  realms which now form one Great Britain.

I can remember some  events of which he seemed a part, when we lived at Fort Hamilton, New  York, about 1846, but they are more like dreams, very indistinct and  disconnected--naturally so, for I was at that time about three years  old. But the day of his return to Arlington, after an absence of more  than two years, I have always remembered. I had a frock or blouse of  some light wash material, probably cotton, a blue ground dotted over  with white diamond figures. Of this I was very proud, and wanted to wear  it on this important occasion. Eliza, my \"mammy,\" objecting, we had  a contest and I won. Clothed in this, my very best, and with my hair  freshly curled in long golden ringlets, I went down into the larger hall  where the whole household was assembled, eagerly greeting my father, who  had just arrived on horseback from Washington, having missed in some way  the carriage which had been sent for him.    There was visiting us at this time Mrs. Lippitt, a friend of my  mother's, with her little boy, Armistead, about my age and size, also  with long curls. Whether he wore as handsome a suit as mine I cannot  remember, but he and I were left together in the background, feeling  rather frightened and awed. After a moment's greeting to those  surrounding him, my father pushed through the crowd, exclaiming:    \"Where is my little boy?\"    He then took up in his arms and kissed--not me, his own child in his  best frock with clean face and well-arranged curls--but my little  playmate, Armistead! I remember nothing more of any circumstances  connected with that time, save that I was shocked and humiliated. I  have no doubt that he was at once informed of his mistake and made ample  amends to me.    A letter from my father to his brother Captain S. S. Lee, United States  Nave, dated \"Arlington, June 30, 1848,\" tells of his coming home:    \"Here I am once again, my dear Smith, perfectly surrounded by Mary and  her precious children, who seem to devote themselves to staring at the  furrows in my face and the"]]]
