In  this volume, Madame, I make another exception, and ask your permission  to offer it to the first woman who consented to be enrolled in the list  of members of the Astronomical Society of France, as foundress of this  splendid work, from the very beginning of our vast association (1887);  and who also desired to take part in the permanent organization of the  Observatory at Juvisy, a task of private enterprise, emancipated from  administrative routine. An Astronomy for Women[1] can not be better  placed than upon the table of a lady whose erudition is equal to her  virtues, and who has consecrated her long career to the pursuit and  service of the Beautiful, the Good, and the True.

Boylan    Edited by Nathen Haskell Dole    The Sorrows of Young Werther          PREFACE      I have carefully collected whatever I have been able to learn of the  story of poor Werther, and here present it to you, knowing that you  will thank me for it. To his spirit and character you cannot refuse your  admiration and love: to his fate you will not deny your tears.    And thou, good soul, who sufferest the same distress as he endured once,  draw comfort from his sorrows; and let this little book be thy friend,  if, owing to fortune or through thine own fault, thou canst not find a  dearer companion.          BOOK I    MAY 4.    How happy I am that I am gone! My dear friend, what a thing is the heart  of man! To leave you, from whom I have been inseparable, whom I love  so dearly, and yet to feel happy! I know you will forgive me. Have not  other attachments been specially appointed by fate to torment a head  like mine? Poor Leonora! and yet I was not to blame. Was it my fault,  that, whilst the peculiar charms of her sister afforded me an agreeable  entertainment, a passion for me was engendered in her feeble heart? And  yet am I wholly blameless? Did I not encourage her emotions? Did I not  feel charmed at those truly genuine expressions of nature, which, though  but little mirthful in reality, so often amused us? Did I not--but  oh! what is man, that he dares so to accuse himself? My dear friend I  promise you I will improve; I will no longer, as has ever been my habit,  continue to ruminate on every petty vexation which fortune may dispense;  I will enjoy the present, and the past shall be for me the past.  No doubt you are right, my best of friends, there would be far less  suffering amongst mankind, if men--and God knows why they are so  fashioned--did not employ their imaginations so assiduously in recalling  the memory of past sorrow, instead of bearing their present lot with  equanimity. Be kind enough to inform my mother that I shall attend to  her business to the best of my ability, and shall give her the earliest  information about it. I have seen my aunt, and find that she is very far  from being the disagreeable person our friends allege her to be. She is  a lively, cheerful woman, with the best of hearts. I explained to her my  mother's wrongs with regard to that part of her portion which has  been withheld from her. She told me the motives and reasons of her own  conduct, and the terms on which she is willing to give up the whole,  and to do more than we have asked. In short, I cannot write further upon  this subject at present; only assure my mother that all will go on well.  And I have again observed, my dear friend, in this trifling affair, that  misunderstandings and neglect occasion more mischief in the world than  even malice and wickedness. At all events, the two latter are of less  frequent occurrence.    In other respects I am very well off here. Solitude in this terrestrial  paradise is a genial balm to my mind, and the young spring cheers with  its bounteous promises my oftentimes misgiving heart. Every tree, every  bush, is full of flowers; and one might wish himself transformed into a  butterfly, to float about in this ocean of perfume, and find his whole  existence in it.    The town itself is disagreeable; but then, all around, you find an  inexpressible beauty of nature. This induced the late Count M to lay  out a garden on one of the sloping hills which here intersect each other  with the most charming variety, and form the most lovely valleys. The  garden is simple; and it is easy to perceive, even upon your first  entrance, that the plan was not designed by a scientific gardener, but  by a man who wished to give himself up here to the enjoyment of his own  sensitive heart. Many a tear have I already shed to the memory of its  departed master in a summer-house which is now reduced to ruins, but  was his favourite resort, and now is mine. I shall soon be master of the  place. The gardener has become attached to me within the last few days,  and he will lose nothing thereby.    MAY 10.    A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these  sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,  and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the  bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed  in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my  talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present  moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When,  while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian  sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees,  and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw  myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie  close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when  I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar  with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I  feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and  the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it  floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when  darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my  soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I  often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions,  could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me,  that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the  infinite God! O my friend--but it is too much for my strength--I sink  under the weight of the splendour of these visions!    MAY 12.    I know not whether some deceitful spirits haunt this spot, or whether  it be the warm, celestial fancy in my own heart which makes everything  around me seem like paradise. In front of the house is a fountain,--a  fountain to which I am bound by a charm like Melusina and her sisters.  Descending a gentle slope, you come to an arch, where, some twenty steps  lower down, water of the clearest crystal gushes from the marble rock.  The narrow wall which encloses it above, the tall trees which encircle  the spot, and the coolness of the place itself,--everything imparts  a pleasant but sublime impression. Not a day passes on which I do not  spend an hour there. The young maidens come from the town to fetch  water,--innocent and necessary employment, and formerly the occupation  of the daughters of kings. As I take my rest there, the idea of the old  patriarchal life is awakened around me. I see them, our old ancestors,  how they formed their friendships and contracted alliances at the  fountain-side; and I feel how fountains and streams were guarded by  beneficent spirits. He who is a stranger to these sensations has never  really enjoyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after the fatigue  of a weary summer day.    MAY 13.    You ask if you shall send me books. My dear friend, I beseech you,  for the love of God, relieve me from such a yoke! I need no more to be  guided, agitated, heated. My heart ferments sufficiently of itself.  I want strains to lull me, and I find them to perfection in my Homer.  Often do I strive to allay the burning fever of my blood; and you have  never witnessed anything so unsteady, so uncertain, as my heart. But  need I confess this to you, my dear friend, who have so often endured  the anguish of witnessing my sudden transitions from sorrow to  immoderate joy, and from sweet melancholy to violent passions? I treat  my poor heart like a sick child, and gratify its every fancy. Do not  mention this again: there are people who would censure me for it.    MAY 15.    The common people of the place know me already, and love me,  particularly the children. When at first I associated with them, and  inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles, some fancied  that I wished to ridicule them, and turned from me in exceeding  ill-humour. I did not allow that circumstance to grieve me: I only felt  most keenly what I have often before observed. Persons who can claim  a certain rank keep themselves coldly aloof from the common people,  as though they feared to lose their importance by the contact; whilst  wanton idlers, and such as are prone to bad joking, affect to descend  to their level, only to make the poor people feel their impertinence all  the more keenly.    I know very well that we are not all equal, nor can be so; but it is my  opinion that he who avoids the common people, in order not to lose their  respect, is as much to blame as a coward who hides himself from his  enemy because he fears defeat.    The other day I went to the fountain, and found a young servant-girl,  who had set her pitcher on the lowest step, and looked around to see  if one of her companions was approaching to place it on her head. I ran  down, and looked at her. \"Shall I help you, pretty lass?\" said I. She  blushed deeply. \"Oh, sir!\" she exclaimed. \"No ceremony!\" I replied. She  adjusted her head-gear, and I helped her. She thanked me, and ascended  the steps.    MAY 17.    I have made all sorts of acquaintances, but have as yet found no  society. I know not what attraction I possess for the people, so many  of them like me, and attach themselves to me; and then I feel sorry when  the road we pursue together goes only a short distance. If you inquire  what the people are like here, I must answer, \"The same as everywhere.\"  The human race is but a monotonous affair. Most of them labour the  greater part of their time for mere subsistence; and the scanty portion  of freedom which remains to them so troubles them that they use every  exertion to get rid of it. Oh, the destiny of man!    But they are a right good sort of people."]]]
