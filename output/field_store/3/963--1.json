How Otto Saw the Great Emperor,          FOREWORD.    Between the far away past history of the world, and that which lies near  to us; in the time when the wisdom of the ancient times was dead and  had passed away, and our own days of light had not yet come, there lay a  great black gulf in human history, a gulf of ignorance, of superstition,  of cruelty, and of wickedness.    That time we call the dark or middle ages.    Few records remain to us of that dreadful period in our world's history,  and we only know of it through broken and disjointed fragments that have  been handed down to us through the generations.    Yet, though the world's life then was so wicked and black, there yet  remained a few good men and women here and there (mostly in peaceful  and quiet monasteries, far from the thunder and the glare of the worlds  bloody battle), who knew the right and the truth and lived according to  what they knew; who preserved and tenderly cared for the truths that the  dear Christ taught, and lived and died for in Palestine so long ago.    This tale that I am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and  suffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the  bad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and  hatred, he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to  by all. And should you follow the story to the end, I hope you may find  it a pleasure, as I have done, to ramble through those dark ancient  castles, to lie with little Otto and Brother John in the high  belfry-tower, or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny  old monastery garden, for, of all the story, I love best those early  peaceful years that little Otto spent in the dear old White Cross on the  Hill.    Poor little Otto's life was a stony and a thorny pathway, and it is well  for all of us nowadays that we walk it in fancy and not in truth.          I. The Dragon's House.    Up from the gray rocks, rising sheer and bold and bare, stood the walls  and towers of Castle Drachenhausen. A great gate-way, with a heavy  iron-pointed portcullis hanging suspended in the dim arch above, yawned  blackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm  between the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the  steep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath. There in the lap of  the hills around stood the wretched straw-thatched huts of the peasants  belonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce,  tilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely  enough to keep body and soul together. Among those vile hovels played  the little children like foxes about their dens, their wild, fierce eyes  peering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair.    Beyond these squalid huts lay the rushing, foaming river, spanned by a  high, rude, stone bridge where the road from the castle crossed it, and  beyond the river stretched the great, black forest, within whose gloomy  depths the savage wild beasts made their lair, and where in winter time  the howling wolves coursed their flying prey across the moonlit snow and  under the net-work of the black shadows from the naked boughs above.    The watchman in the cold, windy bartizan or watch-tower that clung to  the gray walls above the castle gateway, looked from his narrow window,  where the wind piped and hummed, across the tree-tops that rolled in  endless billows of green, over hill and over valley to the blue and  distant slope of the Keiserberg, where, on the mountain side, glimmered  far away the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.    Within the massive stone walls through which the gaping gateway led,  three great cheerless brick buildings, so forbidding that even the  yellow sunlight could not light them into brightness, looked down, with  row upon row of windows, upon three sides of the bleak, stone courtyard.  Back of and above them clustered a jumble of other buildings, tower and  turret, one high-peaked roof overtopping another.    The great house in the centre was the Baron's Hall, the part to the left  was called the Roderhausen; between the two stood a huge square pile,  rising dizzily up into the clear air high above the rest--the great  Melchior Tower.    At the top clustered a jumble of buildings hanging high aloft in the  windy space a crooked wooden belfry, a tall, narrow watch-tower, and a  rude wooden house that clung partly to the roof of the great tower and  partly to the walls.    From the chimney of this crazy hut a thin thread of smoke would now and  then rise into the air, for there were folk living far up in that empty,  airy desert, and oftentimes wild, uncouth little children were seen  playing on the edge of the dizzy height, or sitting with their bare  legs hanging down over the sheer depths, as they gazed below at what was  going on in the court-yard. There they sat, just as little children in  the town might sit upon their father's door-step; and as the sparrows  might fly around the feet of the little town children, so the circling  flocks of rooks and daws flew around the feet of these air-born  creatures.    It was Schwartz Carl and his wife and little ones who lived far up there  in the Melchior Tower, for it overlooked the top of the hill behind the  castle and so down into the valley upon the further side. There, day  after day, Schwartz Carl kept watch upon the gray road that ran like a  ribbon through the valley, from the rich town of Gruenstaldt to the rich  town of Staffenburgen, where passed merchant caravans from the one to  the other--for the lord of Drachenhausen was a robber baron.    Dong! Dong! The great alarm bell would suddenly ring out from the belfry  high up upon the Melchior Tower. Dong! Dong! Till the rooks and daws  whirled clamoring and screaming. Dong! Dong! Till the fierce wolf-hounds  in the rocky kennels behind the castle stables howled dismally in  answer. Dong! Dong!--Dong! Dong!    Then would follow a great noise and uproar and hurry in the castle  court-yard below; men shouting and calling to one another, the ringing  of armor, and the clatter of horses' hoofs upon the hard stone. With the  creaking and groaning of the windlass the iron-pointed portcullis would  be slowly raised, and with a clank and rattle and clash of iron chains  the drawbridge would fall crashing. Then over it would thunder horse and  man, clattering away down the winding, stony pathway, until the great  forest would swallow them, and they would be gone.    Then for a while peace would fall upon the castle courtyard, the cock  would crow, the cook would scold a lazy maid, and Gretchen, leaning out  of a window, would sing a snatch of a song, just as though it were a  peaceful farm-house, instead of a den of robbers.    Maybe it would be evening before the men would return once more. Perhaps  one would have a bloody cloth bound about his head, perhaps one would  carry his arm in a sling; perhaps one--maybe more than one--would be  left behind, never to return again, and soon forgotten by all excepting  some poor woman who would weep silently in the loneliness of her daily  work.    Nearly always the adventurers would bring back with them pack-horses  laden with bales of goods. Sometimes, besides these, they would return  with a poor soul, his hands tied behind his back and his feet beneath  the horse's body, his fur cloak and his flat cap wofully awry. A while  he would disappear in some gloomy cell of the dungeon-keep, until an  envoy would come from the town with a fat purse, when his ransom would  be paid, the dungeon would disgorge him, and he would be allowed to go  upon his way again.    One man always rode beside Baron Conrad in his expeditions and  adventures a short, deep-chested, broad-shouldered man, with sinewy arms  so long that when he stood his hands hung nearly to his knees.    His coarse, close-clipped hair came so low upon his brow that only a  strip of forehead showed between it and his bushy, black eyebrows. One  eye was blind; the other twinkled and gleamed like a spark under the  penthouse of his brows. Many folk said that the one-eyed Hans had drunk  beer with the Hill-man, who had given him the strength of ten, for he  could bend an iron spit like a hazel twig, and could lift a barrel of  wine from the floor to his head as easily as though it were a basket of  eggs.    As for the one-eyed Hans he never said that he had not drunk beer with  the Hill-man, for he liked the credit that such reports gave him with  the other folk. And so, like a half savage mastiff, faithful to death  to his master, but to him alone, he went his sullen way and lived his  sullen life within the castle walls, half respected, half feared by the  other inmates, for it was dangerous trifling with the one-eyed Hans.          II. How the Baron went Forth to Shear.    Baron Conrad and Baroness Matilda sat together at their morning meal  below their raised seats stretched the long, heavy wooden table, loaded  with coarse food--black bread, boiled cabbage, bacon, eggs, a great  chine from a wild boar, sausages, such as we eat nowadays, and flagons  and jars of beer and wine, Along the board sat ranged in the order of  the household the followers and retainers. Four or five slatternly women  and girls served the others as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28650"],[0,"Year of the Big Thaw (#1)"],[1,"this warm and fanciful story of a Connecticut farmer, Marion      Zimmer Bradley has caught some of the glory that is man's love for      man--no matter who he is nor whence he's from. By heck, you'll like      little Matt._       year     of    the    big   thaw     _by ... Marion Zimmer Bradley_       Mr. Emmett did his duty by the visitor from   another world--never doubting the right of it.      _You say that Matthew is your own son, Mr. Emmett?_    Yes, Rev'rend Doane, and a better boy never stepped, if I do say it as  shouldn't. I've trusted him to drive team for me since he was eleven,  and you can't say more than that for a farm boy. Way back when he was a  little shaver so high, when the war came on, he was bounden he was going  to sail with this Admiral Farragut. You know boys that age--like runaway  colts. I couldn't see no good in his being cabin boy on some tarnation  Navy ship and I told him so. If he'd wanted to sail out on a whaling  ship, I 'low I'd have let him go. But Marthy--that's the boy's Ma--took  on so that Matt stayed home. Yes, he's a good boy and a good son.    We'll miss him a powerful lot if he gets this scholarship thing. But I  'low it'll be good for the boy to get some learnin' besides what he gets  in the school here. It's right kind of you, Rev'rend, to look over this  application thing for me.    _Well, if he is your own son, Mr. Emmett, why did you write 'birthplace  unknown' on the line here?_    Rev'rend Doane, I'm glad you asked me that question. I've been turnin'  it over in my mind and I've jest about come to the conclusion it  wouldn't be nohow fair to hold it back. I didn't lie when I said Matt  was my son, because he's been a good son to me and Marthy. But I'm not  his Pa and Marthy ain't his Ma, so could be I stretched the truth jest a  mite. Rev'rend Doane, it's a tarnal funny yarn but I'll walk into the  meetin' house and swear to it on a stack o'Bibles as thick as a cord of  wood.    You know I've been farming the old Corning place these past seven year?  It's good flat Connecticut bottom-land, but it isn't like our land up in  Hampshire where I was born and raised. My Pa called it the Hampshire  Grants and all that was King's land when _his_ Pa came in there and  started farming at the foot of Scuttock Mountain. That's Injun for  fires, folks say, because the Injuns used to build fires up there in the  spring for some of their heathen doodads. Anyhow, up there in the  mountains we see a tarnal power of quare things.    You call to mind the year we had the big thaw, about twelve years before  the war? You mind the blizzard that year? I heard tell it spread down  most to York. And at Fort Orange, the place they call Albany now, the  Hudson froze right over, so they say. But those York folks do a sight of  exaggerating, I'm told.    Anyhow, when the ice went out there was an almighty good thaw all over,  and when the snow run off Scuttock mountain there was a good-sized hunk  of farmland in our valley went under water. The crick on my farm flowed  over the bank and there was a foot of water in the cowshed, and down in  the swimmin' hole in the back pasture wasn't nothing but a big gully  fifty foot and more across, rushing through the pasture, deep as a lake  and brown as the old cow. You know freshet-floods? Full up with sticks  and stones and old dead trees and somebody's old shed floatin' down the  middle. And I swear to goodness, Parson, that stream was running along  so fast I saw four-inch cobblestones floating and bumping along.    I tied the cow and the calf and Kate--she was our white mare; you mind  she went lame last year and I had to shoot her, but she was just a young  mare then and skittish as all get-out--but she was a good little mare.    Anyhow, I tied the whole kit and caboodle of them in the woodshed up  behind the house, where they'd be dry, then I started to get the  milkpail. Right then I heard the gosh-awfullest screech I ever heard in  my life. Sounded like thunder and a freshet and a forest-fire all at  once. I dropped the milkpail as I heard Marthy scream inside the house,  and I run outside. Marthy was already there in the yard and she points  up in the sky and yelled, \"Look up yander!\"    We stood looking up at the sky over Shattuck mountain where there was a  great big--shoot now, I d'no as I can call its name but it was like a  trail of fire in the sky, and it was makin' the dangdest racket you ever  heard, Rev'rend. Looked kind of like one of them Fourth-of-July  skyrockets, but it was big as a house. Marthy was screaming and she  grabbed me and hollered, \"Hez! Hez, what in tunket is it?\" And when  Marthy cusses like that, Rev'rend, she don't know what she's saying,  she's so scared.    I was plumb scared myself. I heard Liza--that's our young-un, Liza  Grace, that got married to the Taylor boy. I heard her crying on the  stoop, and she came flying out with her pinny all black and hollered to  Marthy that the pea soup was burning. Marthy let out another screech and  ran for the house. That's a woman for you. So I quietened Liza down some  and I went in and told Marthy it weren't no more than one of them  shooting stars. Then I went and did the milking.    But you know, while we were sitting down to supper there came the most  awful grinding, screeching, pounding crash I ever heard. Sounded if it  were in the back pasture but the house shook as if somethin' had hit it.    Marthy jumped a mile and I never saw such a look on her face.    \"Hez, what was that?\" she asked.    \"Shoot, now, nothing but the freshet,\" I told her.    But she kept on about it. \"You reckon that shooting star fell in our  back pasture, Hez?\"    \"Well, now, I don't 'low it did nothing like that,\" I told her. But she  was jittery as an old hen and it weren't like her nohow. She said it  sounded like trouble and I finally quietened her down by saying I'd  saddle Kate up and go have a look. I kind of thought, though I didn't  tell Marthy, that somebody's house had floated away in the freshet and  run aground in our back pasture.    So I saddled up Kate and told Marthy to get some hot rum ready in case  there was some poor soul run aground back there. And I rode Kate back to  the back pasture.    It was mostly uphill because the top of the pasture is on high ground,  and it sloped down to the crick on the other side of the rise.    Well, I reached the top of the hill and looked down. The crick were a  regular river now, rushing along like Niagary. On the other side of it  was a stand of timber, then the slope of Shattuck mountain. And I saw  right away the long streak where all the timber had been cut out in a  big scoop with roots standing up in the air and a big slide of rocks  down to the water.    It was still raining a mite and the ground was sloshy and squanchy  under foot. Kate scrunched her hooves and got real balky, not likin' it  a bit. When we got to the top of the pasture she started to whine and  whicker and stamp, and no matter how loud I whoa-ed she kept on  a-stamping and I was plumb scared she'd pitch me off in the mud. Then I  started to smell a funny smell, like somethin' burning. Now, don't ask  me how anything could burn in all that water, because I don't know.    When we came up on the rise I saw the contraption.    Rev'rend, it was the most tarnal crazy contraption I ever saw in my  life. It was bigger nor my cowshed and it was long and thin and as shiny  as Marthy's old pewter pitcher her Ma brought from England. It had a  pair of red rods sticking out behind and a crazy globe fitted up where  the top ought to be. It was stuck in the mud, turned halfway over on the  little slide of roots and rocks, and I could see what had happened, all  right.    The thing must have been--now, Rev'rend, you can say what you like but  that thing must have _flew_ across Shattuck and landed on the slope in  the trees, then turned over and slid down the hill. That must have been  the crash we heard. The rods weren't just red, they were _red-hot_. I  could hear them sizzle as the rain hit 'em.    In the middle of the infernal contraption there was a door, and it hung  all to-other as if every hinge on it had been wrenched halfway off. As I  pushed old Kate alongside it I heared somebody hollering alongside the  contraption. I didn't nohow get the words but it must have been for  help, because I looked down and there was a man a-flopping along in the  water.    He was a big fellow and he wasn't swimming, just thrashin' and  hollering. So I pulled off my coat and boots and hove in after him. The  stream was running fast but he was near the edge and I managed to catch  on to an old tree-root and hang on, keeping his head out of the water  till I got my feet aground. Then I hauled him onto the bank. Up above me  Kate was still whinnying and raising Ned and I shouted at her as I bent  over the man.    Wal, Rev'rend, he sure did give me a surprise--weren't no proper man I'd  ever seed before. He was wearing some kind of red clothes, real shiny  and sort of stretchy and not wet from the water, like you'd expect, but  dry and it felt like that silk and India-rubber stuff mixed together.  And it was such a bright red that at first I didn't see the blood on it.  When I did I knew he were a goner. His chest were all stove in, smashed  to pieces. One of the old tree-roots must have jabbed him as the current  flung him down. I thought he were dead already, but then he opened up  his eyes.    A funny color they were, greeny yellow. And I swear, Rev'rend, when he  opened them eyes I _felt_ he was readin' my mind. I thought maybe he  might be one of them circus fellers in their flying contraptions that  hang at the bottom of a balloon.    He spoke to me in English, kind of choky and stiff, not like Joe the  Portygee sailor or like those tarnal dumb Frenchies up Canady way,  but--well, funny. He said, \"My baby--in ship. Get--baby ...\" He tried to  say more but his eyes went"]]]
