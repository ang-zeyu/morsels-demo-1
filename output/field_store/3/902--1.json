CHICAGO.   NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY.           COPYRIGHT, 1897   BY   NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING CO.   CHICAGO.          INTRODUCTION.      This is the second volume of a series intended to present, in accurate  colored portraiture, and in popular and juvenile biographical text, a  very considerable portion of the common birds of North America, and  many of the more interesting and attractive specimens of other  countries, in many respects superior to all other publications which  have attempted the representation of birds, and at infinitely less  expense. The appreciative reception by the public of Vol. I deserves  our grateful acknowledgement. Appearing in monthly parts, it has been  read and admired by thousands of people, who, through the life-like  pictures presented, have made the acquaintance of many birds, and have  since become enthusiastic observers of them. It has been introduced  into the public schools, and is now in use as a text book by hundreds  of teachers, who have expressed enthusiastic approval of the work and  of its general extension. The faithfulness to nature of the pictures,  in color and pose, have been commended by such ornithologists and  authors as Dr. Elliott Coues, Mr. John Burroughs, Mr. J. W. Allen,  editor of _The Auk_, Mr. Frank M. Chapman, Mr. J. W. Baskett, and  others.    The general text of BIRDS--the biographies--has been conscientiously  prepared from the best authorities by a careful observer of the  feather-growing denizens of the field, the forest, and the shore,  while the juvenile autobiographies have received the approval of the  highest ornithological authority.    The publishers take pleasure in the announcement that the general  excellence of BIRDS will be maintained in subsequent volumes. The  subjects selected for the third and fourth volumes--many of them--will  be of the rare beauty in which the great Audubon, the limner _par  excellence_ of birds, would have found \"the joy of imitation.\"                                          NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY.

AUGUST       NO. 2           ================================          BIRD SONG.      We made several early morning excursions into the woods and fields  during the month of June, and were abundantly rewarded in many  ways--by beholding the gracious awakening of Nature in her various  forms, kissed into renewed activity by the radiance of morn; by the  sweet smelling air filled with the perfume of a multitude of opening  flowers which had drunk again the dew of heaven; by the sight of  flitting clouds across the bluest of skies, patching the green earth  with moving shadows, and sweetest of all, by the twittering, calling,  musical sounds of love and joy which came to the ear from the throats  of the feathered throng. How pleasant to lie prone on one's back on  the cool grass, and gaze upward through the shady green canopy of  boughs, watching the pretty manoeuvers, the joyous greetings, the  lively anxieties, the graceful movements, and even the sorrowful  happenings of the bird-life above us.    Listen to the variety of their tones, as manifest as the difference of  form and color. What more interesting than to observe their habits,  and discover their cosy nests with their beautiful eggs in the  green foliage? Strange that so many persons think only of making a  collection of them, robbing the nests with heartless indifference to  the suffering of the parents, to say nothing of the invasion which  they make of the undoubted rights the birds have from nature to  protection and perpetuation.    Strictly speaking, there are few birds to which the word \"singing\"  can properly be applied, the majority of them not having more than  two or three notes, and they with little suggestion of music in them.  Chanticleer crows, his spouse cackles or clucks, as may be suitable to  the occasion. To what ear are these noises musical? They are rather  language, and, in fact, the varying notes of every species of bird  have a significance which can alone be interpreted by its peculiar  habits. If careful note be made of the immediate conduct of the male  or female bird, as the case may be, after each call or sound, the  meaning of it becomes plain.    A hen whose chicks are scattered in search of food, upon seeing a  hawk, utters a note of warning which we have all heard, and the young  scamper to her for protection beneath her wings. When she has laid an  egg, _Cut-cut-cut-cut-ot-cut!_ announces it from the nest in the barn.  When the chicks are hatched, her _cluck, cluck, cluck_, calls them  from the nest in the wide world, and her _chick, chick, chick_,  uttered quickly, selects for them the dainty which she has found, or  teaches them what is proper for their diet. A good listener will  detect enough intonations in her voice to constitute a considerable  vocabulary, which, if imitated    [CONTINUED ON PAGE 57.]          THE AMERICAN OSPREY.      Here is the picture of a remarkable bird. We know him better by the  name Fish Hawk. He looks much like the Eagle in July \"BIRDS.\" The  Osprey has no use for Mr. Eagle though.    You know the Bald Eagle or Sea Eagle is very fond of fish. Well, he is  not a very good fisherman and from his lofty perch he watches for the  Fish Hawk or Osprey. Do you ask why? Well, when he sees a Fish Hawk  with his prey, he is sure to chase him and take it from him. It is for  this reason that Ospreys dislike the Bald Eagle.    Their food is fish, which as a rule they catch alive.    It must be interesting to watch the Osprey at his fishing. He wings  his way slowly over the water, keeping a watch for fish as they appear  near the surface.    When he sees one that suits him, he hovers a moment, and then, closing  his wings, falls upon the fish.    Sometimes he strikes it with such force that he disappears in the  water for a moment. Soon we see him rise from the water with the prey  in his claws.    He then flies to some tall tree and if he has not been discovered by  his enemy, the Eagle, can have a good meal for his hard work.    Look at his claws; then think of them striking a fish as they must  when he plunges from on high.    A gentleman tells of an Osprey that fastened his claws in a fish that  was too large for him.    The fish drew him under and nothing more was seen of Mr. Osprey. The  same gentleman tells of a fish weighing six pounds that fell from the  claws of a Fish Hawk that became frightened by an Eagle.    The Osprey builds his nest much like the Bald Eagle. It is usually  found in a tall tree and out of reach.    Like the Eagle, he uses the same nest each year, adding to it.  Sometimes it measures five feet high and three feet across. One nest  that was found, contained enough sticks, cornstalks, weeds, moss, and  the like, to fill a cart, and made a load for a horse to draw. Like  the Crows and Blackbirds they prefer to live together in numbers. Over  three hundred nests have been found in the trees on a small island.    One thing I want you to remember about the Osprey. They usually remain  mated for life.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  OSPREY.]          THE AMERICAN OSPREY.      An interesting bird, \"Winged Fisher,\" as he has been happily called,  is seen in places suited to his habits, throughout temperate North  America, particularly about islands and along the seacoast. At Shelter  Island, New York, they are exceedingly variable in the choice of a  nesting place. On Gardiner's Island they all build in trees at a  distance varying from ten to seventy-five feet from the ground; on  Plum Island, where large numbers of them nest, many place their nests  on the ground, some being built up to a height of four or five feet  while others are simply a few sticks arranged in a circle, and the  eggs laid on the bare sand. On Shelter Island they build on the  chimneys of houses, and a pair had a nest on the cross-bar of a  telegraph pole. Another pair had a nest on a large rock. These were  made of coarse sticks and sea weed, anything handy, such as bones,  old shoes, straw, etc. A curious nest was found some years ago on the  coast of New Jersey. It contained three eggs, and securely imbedded  in the loose material of the Osprey's nest was a nest of the Purple  Grackle, containing five eggs, while at the bottom of the Hawk's nest  was a thick, rotten limb, in which was a Tree Swallow's nest of seven  eggs.    In the spring and early autumn this familiar eagle-like bird can be  seen hovering over creek, river, and sound. It is recognized by its  popular name of Fish-Hawk. Following a school of fish, it dashes from  a considerable height to seize its prey with its stout claws. If the  fish is small it is at once swallowed, if it is large, (and the Osprey  will occasionally secure shad, blue fish, bass, etc., weighing five or  six pounds,) the fish is carried to a convenient bluff or tree and  torn to bits. The Bald Eagle often robs him of the fish by seizing it,  or startling him so that he looses his hold.    The Osprey when fishing makes one of the most breezy, spirited  pictures connected with the feeding habits of any of our birds, as  often there is a splashing and a struggle under water when the fish  grasped is too large or the great talons of the bird gets entangled.  He is sometimes carried under and drowned, and large fish have been  washed ashore with these birds fastened to them by the claws.    Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright says: \"I found an Osprey's nest in a crooked  oak on Wakeman's Island in late April, 1893.

APPLETON AND COMPANY                             _All rights reserved_                                     EDITOR'S PREFACE      In issuing this volume of a series of Handbooks on the Artistic  Crafts, it will be well to state what are our general aims.    In the first place, we wish to provide trustworthy text-books of  workshop practice, from the points of view of experts who have  critically examined the methods current in the shops, and putting  aside vain survivals, are prepared to say what is good workmanship,  and to set up a standard of quality in the crafts which are more  especially associated with design. Secondly, in doing this, we hope to  treat design itself as an essential part of good workmanship. During  the last century most of the arts, save painting and sculpture of an  academic kind, were little considered, and there was a tendency to  look on \"design\" as a mere matter of _appearance_. Such  \"ornamentation\" as there was was usually obtained by following in a  mechanical way a drawing provided by an artist who often knew little  of the technical processes involved in production. With the critical  attention given to the crafts by Ruskin and Morris, it came to be seen  that it was impossible to detach design from craft in this way, and  that, in the widest sense, true design is an inseparable element of  good quality, involving as it does the selection of good and suitable  material, contrivance for special purpose, expert workmanship, proper  finish and so on, far more than mere ornament, and indeed, that  ornamentation itself was rather an exuberance of fine workmanship than  a matter of merely abstract lines. Workmanship when separated by too  wide a gulf from fresh thought--that is, from design--inevitably  decays, and, on the other hand, ornamentation, divorced from  workmanship, is necessarily unreal, and quickly falls into  affectation. Proper ornamentation may be defined as a language  addressed to the eye; it is pleasant thought expressed in the speech  of the tool.    In the third place, we would have this series put artistic  craftsmanship before people as furnishing reasonable occupation for  those who would gain a livelihood. Although within the bounds of  academic art, the competition, of its kind, is so acute that only a  very few per cent. can fairly hope to succeed as painters and  sculptors; yet, as artistic craftsmen, there is every probability that  nearly every one who would pass through a sufficient period of  apprenticeship to workmanship and design would reach a measure of  success.    In the blending of handwork and thought in such arts as we propose to  deal with, happy careers may be found as far removed from the dreary  routine of hack labour, as from the terrible uncertainty of academic  art. It is desirable in every way that men of good education should be  brought back into the productive crafts: there are more than enough of  us \"in the city,\" and it is probable that more consideration will be  given in this century than in the last to Design and Workmanship.                                                       W. R. LETHABY.                                       AUTHOR'S NOTE      It is hoped that this book will help bookbinders and librarians to  select sound methods of binding books.    It is intended to supplement and not to supplant workshop training for  bookbinders. No one can become a skilled workman by reading  text-books, but to a man who has acquired skill and practical  experience, a text-book, giving perhaps different methods from those  to which he has been accustomed, may be helpful.    My thanks are due to many friends, including the workmen in my  workshop, for useful suggestions and other help, and to the Society of  Arts for permission to quote from the report of their Special  Committee on leather for bookbinding.    I should also like to express my indebtedness to my master, Mr. T. J.  Cobden-Sanderson, for it was in his workshop that I learned my craft,  and anything that may be of value in this book is due to his  influence.

That bindings can be made,  that will adequately protect books, can be seen from the large number  of fifteenth and sixteenth century bindings now existing on books  still in excellent condition. That bindings are made, that fail to  protect books, may be seen by visiting any large library, when it will  be found that many bindings have their boards loose and the leather  crumbling to dust. Nearly all librarians complain, that they have to  be continually rebinding books, and this not after four hundred, but  after only five or ten years.    It is no exaggeration to say that ninety per cent. of the books bound  in leather during the last thirty years will need rebinding during the  next thirty. The immense expense involved must be a very serious drag  on the usefulness of libraries; and as rebinding is always to some  extent damaging to the leaves of a book, it is not only on account of  the"]]]
