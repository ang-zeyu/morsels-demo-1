Nevertheless a word may not be out of  place for the inception of the work is out of the ordinary. Mr. Hard did  not decide that a book on this subject was needed and then set about  studying these interesting plants. He has observed them, collected them,  induced many friends to join in eating those which proved to be  palatable and delicious--really meddled for years with the various kinds  which are edible and otherwise, and then recently he has decided to  publish a book on his favorite subject. The interesting occupation of  photographing the mushrooms and the toadstools doubtless has contributed  largely to the determination culminating in the materialization of the  treatise.    If I have correctly apprehended the origin and the contributing causes,  we would expect this book to be different from the other books on  mushrooms--not of course in scope and purpose; but the instruction and  suggestions given, the descriptions and general remarks offered, the  wide range of forms depicted in word and picture, the whole make up of  the book in fact, will appeal to the people at large rather than the  college student in particular. The author does not write for the  specially educated few, but for the mass of intelligent people--those  who read and study, but who observe more; those who are inclined to  commune with nature as she displays herself in the glens and glades, in  the fields and forests, and who spend little, if any, time chasing the  forms or sketching the tissues that may be seen on the narrow stage of a  compound microscope.    The book then is for the beginner, and for all beginners; the college  student will find that this is the guide to use when he is ready to  begin studying the mushrooms; the teachers in the schools should all  begin to study mushrooms now, and for the purpose they will find this  book advantageous; the people who see mushrooms often but do not know  them may find here a book that really is a help.    We might wish for color photography when the subject is a delicately  tinted mushroom; but if with it we should lose detail in structure then  the wish would be renounced. The colors can be, approximately,  described, often not so the characteristic markings, shapes and forms.  The halftones from the photographs will, we anticipate, prove a valuable  feature of the book, especially if the plants be most carefully examined  before turning to the pictures. For half an hour the pages may be turned  and the illustrations enjoyed. That, however, would give one no real  knowledge of mushrooms. If such use only is made of the pictures, better  had they never been prepared by Mr. Hard and his friends. But if a  charming little toadstool, a delicately colored mushroom, a stately  agaric, be carefully removed from the bed of loam, the decaying stump,  or the old tree-trunk, then turned over and over again, and upside down,  every part scrutinized, the structure in every detail attentively  regarded--not with repugnant feeling, rather with a sympathetic interest  that should naturally find all organisms inhabiting our globe--then in  due time coming to the picture, a real picture, in the book, it must  surely bring both pleasure and profit. Ponder the suggestion. Then, to  conclude in a word, if Mr. Hard's book will induce people to _learn_ and  _enjoy_ the mushrooms that we have, it will be a success, and great will  be his reward.      W. A. Kellerman, Ph. D.      _Botanical Department,    Ohio State University,    Columbus, O._          AUTHOR'S NOTE    IN MEMORIAM      It is with feelings of profound sadness that I am impelled to supplement  the above Introduction by a brief tribute to the memory of that genial  gentleman and lovable companion, as well as enthusiastic scientist, the  late Dr. W. A. Kellerman.    Spending his life in the pursuit of science, the Angel of Death overtook  him while still in search for wider knowledge of Nature and her works,  and with icy fingers sealed the lids over eyes ever on the alert for the  discovery of hidden truths.    Quiet, reticent, and unassuming, it was given to but few to know the  great-hearted, unselfish sweetness of nature underlying his whole life.  Yet the scientific world in general and Nature students especially,  recognize in Dr. Kellerman's death a loss long to be regretted and not  soon to be repaired.    The foregoing \"Introduction\" from his pen was one of the latest, if not  the last of his public writings, done but a few weeks before being  stricken with the fatal fever which fell upon him in the forests of  Guatemala, and so quickly ended his earthly hopes and aspirations.    It seems doubly sad that one so well and widely known in his life should  be called upon to lay its burdens and its pleasures down while so far  away from all who knew and loved him well; and to rest at last among  strangers in a strange land.    To this beloved friend and companion of so many pleasant days in woods  and fields the author of this book desires to pay the tribute of a  loving remembrance and heartfelt appreciation.      The Author.          PREFACE        \"Various as beauteous, Nature, is thy face;      * * * all that grows, has grace.      All are appropriate. Bog and moss and fen      Are only poor to undiscerning men.      Here may the nice and curious eye explore      How Nature's hand adorns the ruby moor;      Beauties are these that from the view retire,      But will repay th' attention they require.\"      Botany and geology have been favorite studies of the author since  leaving college, thanks to Dr. Nelson, who lives in the hearts of all  his students. He, by his teachings, made these subjects so attractive  and interesting that by one, at least, every spare moment has been given  to following up the studies of botany and paleontology. But the  mycological part of botany was brought practically to the author's  attention by the Bohemian children at Salem, Ohio, at the same time  arousing a desire to know the scientific side of the subject and thus to  be able to help the many who were seeking a personal knowledge of these  interesting plants.    Every teacher should be able to open the doors of Nature to his pupils  that they may see her varied handiwork, and, as far as possible, assist  in removing the mist from their eyes that they may see clearly the  beauties of meadow, wood or hillside.    In beginning the fuller study of the subject the writer labored at great  disadvantage because, for a number of years, there was but little  available literature. Every book written upon this subject, in this  country, was purchased as soon as it came out and all have been very  helpful.    The study has been a very great pleasure, and some very delightful  friendships have been made while in search for as great a variety of  species as possible.    For a number of years the object was simply to become familiar with the  different genera and species, and no photographs of specimens were made.  This was a great mistake; for, after it was determined to bring out this  work, it seemed impossible to find many of the plants which the author  had previously found in other parts of the state.    However, this failure has been very largely overcome through the  generous courtesy of his esteemed friends,--Mr. C. G. Lloyd, of  Cincinnati; Dr. Fisher, of Detroit; Prof. Beardslee, of Ashville, N. C.;  Prof. B. O. Longyear, of Ft. Collins, Col., and Dr. Kellerman, of Ohio  State University,--who have most kindly furnished photographs  representing those species found earlier in other parts of the state.  The species represented here have all been found in this state within  the past few years.    The writer is under great obligation to Prof. Atkinson, of Cornell  University, for his very great assistance and encouragement in the study  of mycology. His patience in examining and determining plants sent him  is more fully appreciated than can be expressed here. Dr. William  Herbst, Trexlertown, Pa., has helped to solve many difficult problems;  so also have Mr. Lloyd, Prof. Morgan, Capt. McIlvaine and Dr. Charles H.  Peck, State Botanist of New York.    The aim of the book has been to describe the species, as far as  possible, in terms that will be readily understood by the general  reader; and it is hoped that the larger number of illustrations will  make the book helpful to those who are anxious to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29122"],[0,"Mammals Obtained (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                       Mammals Obtained by Dr. Curt von Wedel from   the Barrier Beach of Tamaulipas, Mexico       BY       E.

RAYMOND HALL      What species of mammals occur on the \"coastal island\", barrier beach, of  Tamaulipas? Are the closest relatives of these mammals on Padre and  Mustang islands of Texas, instead of on the mainland of Tamaulipas, or  are the mammals on the barrier beach distinct from all others? These  were questions that Dr. von Wedel of Oklahoma City and I asked ourselves  in March of 1950 when we were in southern Texas. With the aim in mind of  answering these questions, Dr. von Wedel arranged round-trip  transportation, by air, for the two of us between Brownsville, Texas,  and Boca Jesus Maria. The latter place is a \"pass\", tidal inlet, through  the long barrier beach. The waters of the Gulf of Mexico and of the  lagoon behind the beach flow back and forth with the changing tides  through the inlet.    We arrived at Boca Jesus Maria on March 18, 1950, and left on March 22,  1950. Our headquarters there were in one of the four one-story buildings  immediately north of the inlet. This place is approximately 89-1/2 miles  south, and 10 miles west, of Matamoros, Mexico. Most of our collecting  was done on the sand dunes one and one-half miles north of the buildings  but on the evening of March 20 we made a round-trip, by boat of course,  to the sand dunes on the south side of the inlet to set traps; these  traps, and the _Dipodomys_ that were caught in them, were picked up the  following morning.    At the time of our visit, the part of the barrier beach south of the  tidal inlet was connected with the mainland. The connection was far to  the southward, according to our pilot, Mr. Kagy of Brownsville, and also  according to the testimony of the Mexicans at the fishing camp where we  stayed on the north side of the inlet. The barrier beach which lay to  the north of the inlet extended sixty-odd miles northward to the delta  of the Rio Grande and had, we were told, eight \"passes,\" including Paso  Jesus Maria. At the time of our visit, however, only three of these  tidal inlets were open, it was said; the five others were thought to be  filled in with sand, which permitted terrestrial animals to move from  one part of the beach to another. Dr. von Wedel and I saw two tidal  inlets that were open when we were being flown back to Brownsville.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Diagram of physiographic features of the barrier  beach of Tamaulipas. Top view looking down, as from an airplane, on the  beach. Bottom view is profile.]    The long, low, sandy island, technically a barrier beach, irrespective  of tide varied in width from a quarter of a mile to as much as a mile  and was separated from the mainland by the Laguna Madre, which was four  miles wide opposite our trapping station. To the northward the width of  the lagoon gradually increased until, at a place thirty miles north of  our trapping station, the lagoon was almost 20 miles wide.    The island was perhaps four feet above high tide. Superimposed on this,  in places, there were sand dunes, technically barchans, so arranged that  the end of one touched the end of the next. The tops of some were as  much as 20 feet above high tides and the chain of these connected-dunes  on which we trapped was approximately a mile long. Incipient tidal  inlets were frequent; they were where storm-driven waves of high tides  had broken across the island between the adjacent ends of two dunes. The  windward side of a dune was toward the Gulf and the slope of that side  was gentler than that on the leeward side. According to the cycle  described by Davis (Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts and Sciences, 22:303-332,  1896) and recently figured on page 364 by Lobeck (Geomorphology, 1st  ed., xii + 731 pp., 1939, McGraw Hill Book Co., Inc., New York) the  barrier beach concerned was in the early part of the \"Middle Youth  Stage\".    Typically, on the center of the area in the lee of a dune there was a  patch of plum brush, almost five feet tall and so dense that a person  could not penetrate it. A belt of grass, 20 to 100 feet wide, surrounded  the plum brush. The grass was approximately 20 inches high. Outside the  area of grass, there were widely-spaced xerophitic shrubs which grew  also on the dunes. The diagram (fig. 1) shows these prominent features  as a person might see them if he looked directly down from an airplane.    We obtained specimens of the spotted ground squirrel (_Citellus  spilosoma_), Ord kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys ordii_), hispid cotton rat  (_Sigmodon hispidus_) and black-tailed jack rabbit (_Lepus  californicus_). Tracks and other sign of the coyote (_Canis latrans_)  were seen. So far as we could ascertain, by our own investigations and  from our Mexican hosts at the fishing camp, no other kinds of native  mammals lived on the island. The ground squirrel and kangaroo rat were  found by us on only the sandy areas where there were xerophitic shrubs.  The cotton rat was found only in the grass. The jack rabbit and coyote  ranged over the whole of the island excepting the areas of plum brush in  which we saw no sign of any mammal.    To answer the second of our initial questions: The affinities of the  mammals of the barrier beach of Tamaulipas are approximately equally  divided between those of the mainland and those of Padre Island. The  ground squirrel is indistinguishable from the subspecies which occurs  both on the mainland and Padre Island to the northward; the other three  kinds of mammals of which we obtained specimens prove to be  subspecifically distinct from any previously named kinds and seem to be  confined to the off-shore beach. Accounts of these four mammals and of a  previously unnamed subspecies of kangaroo rat on Mustang Island, Texas,  follow.

[_Citellus spilosoma_] _annectens_, Trouessart, Catalogus       Mammalium ..., p. 340.    Thirteen specimens (Nos. 35441-35453) were collected. All are from the  north side of the tidal inlet. Although the ground squirrels were easily  trapped, it was difficult to obtain a perfect skin because the gulls  (_Larus_ sp.) pulled the skin off of the distal part of the tail as soon  as a squirrel was secured in a trap. The specimens seem not to differ  from Texan specimens from the type locality and Mustang Island.      Dipodomys ordii parvabullatus new subspecies    Ord Kangaroo Rat    _Type._--Male, adult, skull and skin, No. 35454, Mus. Nat. Hist. Univ.  Kansas, from island, 88 miles south and 10 miles west of Matamoros,  Tamaulipas, Mexico; obtained 19 March 1950 by E.R. Hall and Curt von  Wedel; original No. 6778 E.R. Hall.    _Range._--Islands along coast of Tamaulipas, Mexico.    _Diagnosis._--Size small (see measurements). Color pale; entire dorsal  surface Light Ochraceous-Buff (Capitalized color terms according to  Ridgway: Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D.C.,  1912), purest on sides and flanks, upper parts lightly suffused with  black; cheeks white; plantar surfaces of hind feet, dorsal and ventral  stripe of tail, and anterior face of ear brownish. Skull small; auditory  bullae smaller (actually and relative to remainder of skull) than in any  other known kind of _Dipodomys_, excepting the one from Mustang Island,  Texas (named beyond) in which the breadth is approximately the same;  rostrum and interorbital region narrow.    _Comparisons._--From _Dipodomys ordii sennetti_ (Allen), of the  mainland of Texas, _D. o. parvabullatus_ differs in: Color paler on  pigmented areas; white areas more extensive; skull smaller, in all parts  measured, except the nasals which are slightly longer. From _Dipodomys  ordii compactus_ of Padre Island, Texas, _D. o. parvabullatus_ differs  in: Tail and hind foot shorter; skull smaller in all parts measured,  especially so in breadth across maxillary processes of zygomatic arches.    _Remarks._--_D. o. parvabullatus_ resembles _D. o. sennetti_ in external  proportions and _D. o. compactus_ in cranial proportions.    No difference was detected between specimens from the two sides of the  tidal inlet 89 miles south of Matamoros. Only one of the 14 specimens is  of the light color phase (upper parts Cartridge Buff). This pale  specimen is from the north side of the inlet. The brownish stripe on the  ventral side of the tail is absent on the distal two-fifths of the tail  and the specimens are uniform in this respect. On the occlusal surfaces  of the cheek-teeth, the enamel surrounding the dentine is incomplete on  both the lingual and labial sides of the teeth of five individuals and  is incomplete on the labial side of some of the teeth of a sixth  specimen.    In the snap traps, all of which were baited with rolled oats, more than  twice as many land crabs as kangaroo rats were taken. Judging from  tracks in the sand, land crabs greatly outnumbered kangaroo rats. The  parietal bones in two of the 13 skulls are much eroded by some parasite  (seeming"]]]
