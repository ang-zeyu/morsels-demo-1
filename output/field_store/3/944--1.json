THE INFLUENCE OF THE BIBLE UPON CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.      Civil government is a state of society in which men are reduced to order;  it is a government in which every citizen has full power over his own  rights, but is not at liberty to infringe upon the rights of others. The  deepest thought in the word _civil_ is the idea of being hedged around by  restraints, so as to be shut in from all privilege, or right, of meddling  with the rights of others. The Welsh use the word \"cau,\" to shut, inclose,  fence, hedge.    Civil liberty is liberty modified by the rights of others. No man has a  right, by any Divine warrant, to infringe upon the rights of another; and  cannot do it without forfeiting more or less of his own. This thought,  that a man may forfeit his rights, is as essential to proper conceptions  of civil government, and civil liberty, as the thought that a man has  rights; for if there be no forfeiture of rights through crime, then all  legal punishments are without foundation in justice; even the right of  self-defense, individually and nationally, ceases to exist. And if this be  taken away, all support and strength in civil government is gone; anarchy  and ruin only may remain. In all civilized nations a man is regarded as  forfeiting his right, _even to life_, by trampling upon the _life-right_  of another, and, while the danger lasts, the assailed may defend his life,  in the absence of any other defense, even at the expense of the life of  the assailant. To deny this doctrine of the right of self-defense, it is  only necessary that we deny that a man can forfeit the right of life. To  do this is equal to the affirmation that God is the author of coexisting  and conflicting rights. Such rights can exist only at the expense of the  destruction of all governments, both human and Divine, as well as all  healthy influences of social institutions. It is essential to civil  liberty to restrain men from all interference with the rights of others.  The greatest degree of civil liberty is enjoyed where men are successfully  restrained from such officious interposition. A people may enjoy civil  liberty without extending the right of suffrage to all ages and to both  sexes; without making all eligible to office; without abolishing paternal  authority over minors; without abolishing the punishment of criminals, or  the right of the State to the service of its citizens when the public good  requires it.    The word _civil_ also signifies courteous, complaisant, gentle and  obliging, well-bred, affable, kind. From this it will be seen that civil  government depends upon the intelligence and righteousness of the people.  The absence of all legal demands and all legal restraints would be the  absence of all government. It would be libertinism or lawlessness. The  great majority of men, from the earliest ages of the world to the present  time, have been under the control of tyrants, and have known little  exemption from despotic rule. There is not a single Pagan, Mahomedan, or  anti-Christian country to-day in which the spirit of liberty has an  abiding place. She may have brooded over them at intervals, but, like  Noah's bird, found no resting place.    The influence of the Bible preventing the young, the mature, and the aged  from crime, causing men and women to love and respect our humanity, is of  necessity _to the same extent_ the very life of civil government, and  consequently the life of civil liberty. It has been said the Bible is the  great protector and guardian of the liberties of men. It was an axiom in  an apostate church, that ignorance is the mother of devotion; but the true  origin of this axiom is that ignorance which fastens the chains of civil  and ecclesiastic despotism.    It is not possible for a people thoroughly under the influence of the  teachings of the religion of Christ to be ignorant of their own rights and  the responsibility of their rulers. Where the teachings of Christ and the  Bible form public opinion the people must be free. No such tyrant as  Caligula or Nero would be tolerated in Protestant Christendom. The  necessary effect of Christianity upon an abused people is to make them  restless under a tyrant's yoke. The author of Travels in England, France,  Spain and the Barbary States, although an enemy to the Bible, said, after  leaving the Barbary States and arriving in France, I could breathe more  freely. I no longer looked upon my fellow men with distrust, and I thanked  God that I was once more in a Christian land. When we survey the history  of past events and kingdoms we, too, find good reasons to thank the Lord  for a Christian land. The only authoritative history of remote events and  kingdoms is in the writings of Moses and the Prophets. In the times of  Moses there were no historical records in Greece, Chaldea, Phoenicia,  Egypt or Assyria. No other historian lived so remote as Moses. He was five  hundred years before Sanconiathan, and more than a thousand years before  Manetho. He has been called the _father of history_. Men have claimed that  astronomical calculations carry us farther back, but this claim has been  successfully refuted by the calculations of Bedford. There is a fact upon  record in Gillie's history of Greece that confirms Bedford's calculations.  This man says: After Alexander conquered Babylon he eagerly demanded the  astronomical calculations that had been preserved in that ancient capital  about nineteen centuries, and ordered them faithfully transcribed and  handed to Aristotle, who was the preceptor of this prince. They extended  back twenty two hundred and thirty-four years behind the Christian era.  There is no reliable history so ancient as the writings of Moses. All the  efforts between Moses and David are without regular form--a mass of  rearranged tradition, both fabulous and corrupt; long after the times of  David the pages of writers regarded authentic, are loaded with absurd and  disgusting fictions.    Nimrod's kingdom was Babel, and he was a tyrant, instigating war and  bloodshed everywhere, laying the nations under tribute and transmitting  his tyrannical spirit and powers from son to son, until the Egyptians  drove his descendants into Canaan and Joshua drove them into Greece. Ninus  inherited the spirit of his father, and the history of his empire, until  it was overthrown by the Babylonians and Medes, is a history of absolute  Assyrian despotism.    The Babylonian Empire was no better from the revolt of Nebopolassar to its  destruction by Cyrus. Egypt and Persia were also equally deprived of the  blessings of civil liberty. Greece and Rome were in no better condition  with the exceptions of a few restrictions consequent upon Greece being  controlled by established customs and Rome by the Senate. These nations  were comparatively free, but their freedom did not grow out of a  comprehension of the rights of their citizens.    The Jewish Republic is the first ancient government where the people  exerted any proper influence in state affairs. It is worthy of special  consideration that the Jewish laws were adapted to civil liberty in an age  when human rights were so little understood. There is no one work so full  of the great principles of civil wisdom as the Pentateuch and the history  of Judah and Israel. They were free in choosing their form of government;  free in the establishment of their laws; free in the fact that their laws  governed and not men. Their form of government was republican, with  healthy limitations. Twelve tribes were united in one great republic like  so many confederated states bound together for purposes of defence. At  first God was their king. After awhile they desired another king, and  their form of government was changed to a limited monarchy upon their own  request. Their kings did not enter upon their duties until they were  accepted and crowned by the people, and then they were restricted in their  power by sworn stipulations.    Bad men do not make good citizens. There never was a nation of infidels or  idolaters, existing as such, in the enjoyment of freedom. Holland was free  as long as she was virtuous. She flourished as a republic, produced great  and learned statesmen; she became corrupt, and infidelity banished her  glory.    When Perrier, of France, the successor of Lafayette in the office of Prime  Minister to Louis Phillipe, was on his death bed he exclaimed, with much  emphasis and zeal, \"France must have religion\"--man must be governed by  moral truth or by despotic power. Liberty does not flourish without  morality, nor morality without the religion of the Bible. The love of law,  the love of wisdom, the love of benevolent institutions, and the love of  virtue makes a people free. When these are absent tyrants are present.  When a nation becomes corrupt, liberty degenerates into parties and  factions until the stubborn necessity of the strong arm of despotism makes  its appearance to control the passions of men. If pride, selfishness, love  of gold, thirst for power and licentiousness, are not controlled liberty  will die. It may be truthfully said that the high-toned principles of  Bible morality are necessary to the good of all classes. These, and only  these, will unite a people in one grand national brotherhood, wiping out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28075"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, March, 1880 (#1)"],[1,"Christian Foundation,                                       Or,                         Scientific and Religious Journal                                  Vol. 1.

It is profitable for us to occasionally survey the dark arena where men  have played their part, in lonely gloom, without a Savior and without a  God. Pagan morality, being without the motives and restraints of revealed  religion, and guided wholly by the passions and the lights of reason and  nature, is grossly defective. It has no settled standard of right and  wrong. It is vain to look, in all heathen philosophy for any settled  principles of duty or motives that commend themselves to enlightened  minds.    What is the basis and character of virtue? What is the law of moral  conduct? What is the object which governs it? In what does human happiness  consist? These are questions which have never been satisfactorily answered  by the unaided powers of the human mind. The annals of Pagan history show  the real results of all their speculations upon these questions. They are  comprehensively presented in the following: \"They became vain in their  imaginations and their foolish hearts were darkened. They were filled with  all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,  envy, murder, deceit, malignity. They were backbiters, haters of God,  despiteful, proud, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  without natural affection, implacable and unmerciful.\" Their manners and  habits were the results of mere whim and caprice when they were not the  results of simple love of wickedness. The vice of one community was the  virtue of another; and refinement in one was unpardonable rudeness in  another. The public festivals celebrated in Egypt are disgraceful upon the  pages of history, being accompanied with shameful practices. Egypt was  noted for corrupt morals as far back as the times of Abraham. Asia Minor  was no better; unrighteousness, sensuality and luxury prevailed. In Greece  there was brutal savageness in its most hideous forms; in the age of its  greatest refinement sin was dressed up in the finest style. The Olympic,  Pythian and Isthmian games, which were kept up to give strength to the  body and courage in the battle, were debasing and corrupting to the lowest  degree of wretchedness. The ages of ancient heroism were filled up with  crime and debauchery. They were fruitful in incest and parricide, and all  the dark and gloomy events which were necessary to make up the most  fearful picture of immorality. The monarchs of Assyria spent their time  mainly in debasing crime and voluptuousness. The brightest and best days  of Babylon were notorious for lewdness and accomplishment in crime and  iniquity; loaded with riches, they spared no pains and withheld no means  in the production of all that gratified their lusts and fed their  passions. In Babylon there was a certain well known temple in which  adultery was legalized by _compulsory law_ for the purpose of increasing  the public revenue. The ancient Pagan religions sanctioned and practiced  the most detestible licentiousness. Cato commended young men for visiting  houses of ill-fame. Such was the very best phase of morals and public  manners in the purest state of Roman society. What must have been the  worst? The worst! Well, I will give you an idea of it. The Emperor Nero  drove through the streets of the capital with his mistress in a state of  nudity; and the Emperor Commodus first seduced and then murdered his own  sister. Here reason, blinded by lust, was their guide. These people were  not troubled with that terrible book called the Bible. Happy (?) state.  How would we like to have our homes in the midst of such fellows? Their  conscience had no fastenings, how could their doctrines excite to moral  virtue?    How much better are the principles of modern infidels? Bolingbroke's  morality is all embraced in self-love. Hobbes claims that the only basis  of right and wrong is the civil law. Rousseau says all the morality of  actions is in the judgement we ourselves form of them. Shaftsbury says,  all the obligations to be virtuous arise from the advantages of virtue,  and the disadvantages of vice. Have such moral principles ever reformed  the world? Do they reform their advocates? Did you ever know a man to  reform after he became an advocate of such principles? Did you ever know a  man to reform after understanding and abandoning the Christian religion?  If any such ever reformed their lives after setting themselves on Pagan  ground, by opposing Christianity, I have yet to learn the fact. It is the  morality of a wicked world that simply asks for the profitable, and not  the right; which inquires not for duty, but for self-interest--for the  opinions of men; it is a body without a spirit--a whitewashed  sepulchre--splendid only in sepulchral greatness.    Morality rests not upon principles that clothe themselves in various garbs  to please the different fancies of the different ages, consulting simply  the spirit of the times. Such morality is one thing to-day and quite  another to-morrow--it is variable as the seasons. It adapts itself to the  occasion--to the hour. It is very pliant--it has no conscience, but is  always popularity-seeking. The morality of the Christian religion is very  different. In the New Testament we find a morality as pure, lofty and  unchanging as its divine author; it purifies and regulates the inner  man--\"make the tree good and the fruit _will be good_.\" The Bible settles  the great question of duty. It teaches us that to do right is to do that  which is right in itself, from _pure_ motives and with a _right spirit_.  These two things God hath joined together, viz: the right deed from right  motives, and the right spirit. A man's conscience may be satisfied without  the right motives and without the right spirit, but that is not enough.    It is not enough for a man to have the right spirit and the right motives,  unless he does that which is right in itself. Conscience may be warped by  malevolence, selfishness, prejudice, or education, until the man is led to  do that which is detestable in the sight of God. The time may come when  this man will regret his foolishness, and see that he was wrong, like Saul  of old.    Right things may be done from a wrong spirit, and wrong things may be done  from a right spirit, but the morality of the Christian religion consists  in doing right things from right motives and in a right spirit.    The great motive that governs us as Christian moralists is the fact made  known in these words, _God requires it_. You may talk of the dignity of  correct morals, of their beauty and virtue, and of the terrible nature of  vice, and of the demands of a well-governed selfishness, but all these are  weak compared with the authority of the Supreme Being whom Christians love  and adore.    If we would reform men successfully we must bring the conscience under the  strong bonds of obligation; we must extend the authority of the great  Lawgiver over the understanding, over the conscience, over the memory,  over the imagination, over the entire inner man. This alone will stop the  germinations of sin, and check wickedness in its conception. This is the  tap-root of the tree of virtue--the source of virtuous principles,  demonstrating the truthfulness of the axiom, \"Make the tree good and the  fruit will be good.\" Simple advantage is not the foundation of virtue; it  has a nature aside from its tendencies to worldly profit. Otherwise virtue  would often cease to be virtue, and vice would often cease to be vice.  Anciently there were moral philosophers who plead that utility was the  only foundation of virtue. Paul speaks of some who supposed \"Godliness was  gain.\" Such a morality would be the most uncertain thing in the world;  give it what name you choose, it is mere selfishness.            THE INFLUENCE OF THE BIBLE UPON SOCIAL LIFE AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS.      Man's entire nature forces him directly into a social state. He is  destitute of the strength possessed by many of the lower animals, and  naturally unable for want of speed to escape their attacks, so care for  life leads him into the closest alliances with his fellows. Childhood and  old age necessitate dependence, and his wants, during those periods, bring  him under obligations to others during his strength and manhood. The  social state is also necessary to the development of his intellectual  nature, and some of his natural affections can be exercised only in such a  state. Benevolence, gratitude, complacency and heroism are not exercised  in an insolated condition--they are called out only in mutual associations  with our fellow-men.    The noblest efforts of intellectual strength and of human ingenuity are  made under the most powerful influence of society. Thus encouraged, men  have collected armies, founded kingdoms and governed them. In such  kingdoms the arts and sciences have flourished in a greater or less  degree, and imperfect morals have crowned their labors and lifted their  minds as high as their unaided powers have permitted. Such has been the  best condition in which the"]]]
