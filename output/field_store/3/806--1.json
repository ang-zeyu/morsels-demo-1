PUBLISHERS' NOTICE.      The extraordinary popularity achieved and maintained by Dr. GEO. H.  NAPHEYS' _Physical Life of Woman_, places it beyond question among the  classics of the English language. Convinced of its high literary as well  as medical value, the present publishers have spared no pains or expense  to place it before the public in the most attractive style.    The _text_ has been most carefully revised and rewritten by the eminent  author himself; extensive additions of important matter the fruit of  three more years devoted to the study of the subject and the wants of  readers, have been incorporated. In type, paper and binding, the most  appropriate materials have been selected. And, to satisfy the repeated  requests of purchasers, permission has been obtained from the author to  insert his portrait, engraved on steel by one of the most skilful London  artists.    With these additions, the _Physical Life of Woman_ comes before the  public with all the novelty and freshness of a new book, and also with  the solid and substantial reputation for practical worth which its sales  of nearly _fifty thousand_ copies a year for _three_ years guarantee to  it.    We add a      SYNOPSIS OF THE BOOK.    It treats of woman in her three great positions in life, as the MAIDEN,  the WIFE, and the MOTHER.    Under the first of these is discussed the mysterious change she  undergoes when ripening from the indifferent girl to the tender and  sensitive virgin. The dangers she runs at this critical epoch are  carefully noted, and the rules to prevent and remedy them clearly set  forth. The all-absorbing topic of _Love_, is next treated of in a pure  and elevated style, but strictly from the physician's point of view, and  many salutary hints are given to direct the passion to noble ends and in  proper channels, and to teach the youthful reader how to shun  unfortunate unions.    In the part addressed to _Wives_ the health of the married couple is  first considered as being essential to their happiness. Plainly, yet  delicately, the rules that should govern them are laid down; the absence  of children and their excessive numbers are both mentioned, as requiring  appropriate correction, and an unsparing hand is laid upon certain  prevalent social vices. A full discussion of the important topic of the  inheritance of physical and mental traits will be found, and two most  thorough and practical chapters on Pregnancy and Confinement are added,  most invaluable to every young wife.    The duties of the _Mother_ are next set forth, in nursing her child, and  taking proper care of it, in training its budding powers, and also in  giving her own attention to it in some of the more common diseases to  which children are subject.    The sections devoted to _Health in Marriage_ will be peculiarly welcome  to many women suffering in health from they know not what exact cause,  but really from some of those inward or local weaknesses which are here  described. While to very many others who are approaching or about  passing through the critical epoch of the _Change of Life_, the full and  well-considered views of the author in the part devoted to that period  will be read with benefit and gratitude.    A carefully prepared Index and a copious list of authorities close the  volume.

NAPHEYS, A.M., M.D.    MEMBER OF THE PHILADELPHIA COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY; CORRESPONDING MEMBER  OF THE GYNECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF BOSTON; LATE CHIEF OF MEDICAL CLINIC OF  THE JEFFERSON MEDICAL COLLEGE; AUTHOR OF \"THE TRANSMISSION OF LIFE,\"  \"THE PREVENTION AND CURE OF DISEASE,\" \"MODERN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS,\"  \"LETTERS FROM EUROPE,\" ETC.      \"Je veux qu'une femme ait des clartes de tout.\"--Moliere.    New Edition.    WITH THE FINAL CORRECTIONS OF THE AUTHOR, AND A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.    PHILADELPHIA:  DAVID McKAY, PUBLISHER,  23 SOUTH NINTH STREET.  1889.      Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1878, BY D. G.  BRINTON, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. All  rights reserved.          EDITOR'S PREFACE.      In presenting a third edition of this work to the public, with the final  changes and improvements of the author, the publishers have felt it a  duty to attach to it a brief sketch of his life, which drew to so early  and lamented a termination. The whole has also been submitted to a  careful revision, in order that it might be brought down to the latest  advances in the department of science of which it treats, and also to  include in it the final suggestions of the author.    While Dr. Napheys evidently considered the second edition of the present  work as meeting closely the requirements of readers, and therefore left  behind him no notes which would alter the general plan, a number of  corrections and minor changes have been made in the text, various  paragraphs have been materially modified, and the Appendix referring to  authorities more or less altered.    The continued popularity of the work has been shown, not only by the  steady demand for it, but by the efforts of various authors to write  imitations of it, and various publishers to issue mutilated and  imperfect editions. Against these the present publishers would warn  innocent purchasers. The present is the only edition containing the  important additions and corrections made by the author during the latter  years of his life; and none other was authorized by him.    In its present form, _The Physical Life of Woman_ may justly claim to  count among the classics of American literature. Its popularity  increases with time, and none of the many similar works which have  appeared have approached it in public estimation. It is believed that in  the present edition no important scientific fact bearing upon the  subject has been omitted, and the most recent developments of hygiene  will be found discussed.    1878.          PREFACE TO THE SECOND STEREOTYPE EDITION.      Three years have passed since the author of the present work ventured to  lay it before the public, not without unusual anxiety as to the manner  in which he had fulfilled a task he knew to be so fruitful of good  results if well done. Those years of trial are over, and they have  brought a recognition of his labors beyond his most sanguine dreams.  Nearly _one hundred and fifty thousand copies_ of the work have been  sold in that period; it has been separately republished both in Canada  and England; it has been honored by a translation into German; the  imitations of it which have been written form almost a small library;  and, more to the satisfaction of the author than all this, it has  received the highest praise both at home and abroad, from both the  medical profession and the general learned world.    The present new stereotype edition contains the result of three more  years of study and experience, enlightened and aided by very many  letters from readers, which served to point out wherein the previous  edition fell short of their wants. The text has been carefully revised,  and in large part wholly rewritten; nearly one hundred and fifty pages  of selected new matter have been added; and the latest steps of medical  science in this direction have been followed.    Of the parts which are quite new, and which from the inquiries of  numerous readers will add greatly to the value of the work, are the  sections on the disturbances of the monthly function in girls, the care  of the child, the management of diseases of children, the diseases  incident to pregnancy, childbed, and nursing, etc.    Indeed, in the present edition the author has aimed to omit nothing  which can aid Woman in performing her full duty to herself and others,  so far as that duty lies in the sphere of her Physical Life, whether she  is called upon to act as Wife, Mother, Teacher, or Guide. His most  ardent desire continues to be that the work will be found a sure and  safe monitor amid the difficult duties of Maidenhood and Maternity.    LONDON, ENGLAND, October, 1872.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.      It seems well to offer, at the outset, a few words explanatory of the  nature and object of this book. The author feels that its aim is novel,  is daring, and will perhaps subject him to criticism. He therefore make  his plea, _pro domo sua_, in advance.    The researches of scientific men within the last few years have brought  to light very many facts relating to the physiology of woman, the  diseases to which she is subject, and the proper means to prevent those  diseases. Such information, if universally possessed, cannot but result  in great benefit to the individual and the commonwealth. The difficulty  is to express one's self clearly and popularly on topics never referred  to in ordinary social intercourse. But as the physician is obliged daily  to speak in plain yet decorous language of such matters, the author felt  that the difficulty was not unsurmountable.    He is aware that a respectable though diminishing class in the community  maintain that nothing which relates exclusively to either sex should  become the subject of popular medical instruction. With every  inclination to do this class justice, he feels sure that such an opinion  is radically erroneous. Ignorance is no more the mother of purity than  she is of religion. The men and women who study and practise medicine  are not the worse, but the better, for their knowledge of such matters.  So it would be with the community. Had every person a sound  understanding of the relations of the sexes, one of the most fertile  sources of crime would be removed.    A brief appendix has been added, directed more especially to the  professional reader,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],[0,"Confessions of a Book-Lover (#1)"],[1,"OF A  BOOK-LOVER    BY    MAURICE FRANCIS EGAN    [Illustration]    GARDEN CITY      NEW YORK    DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & COMPANY    1922          COPYRIGHT, 1922, BY    DOUBLEDAY, PAGE & COMPANY    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED, INCLUDING THAT OF TRANSLATION  INTO FOREIGN LANGUAGES, INCLUDING THE SCANDINAVIAN    PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES    AT    THE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS, GARDEN CITY, N.

It is the only way to know  all their \"curves,\" all those little shadows of expression and small  lights. There is a glamour which you never _see_ if you begin to read  with a serious intention late in life, when questions of technique and  grammar and mere words begin to seem too important.    Then you have become too critical to feel through all Fenimore Cooper's  verbiage the real lakes and woods, or the wild fervour of romance  beneath dear Sir Walter's mat of words. You lose the unreclaimable  flavour of books. A friend you may irretrievably lose when you lose a  friend--if you are so deadly unfortunate as to lose a friend--for even  the memories of him are embittered; but no great author can ever have  done anything that will make the book you love less precious to you.    The new school of pedagogical thought disapproves, I know, of  miscellaneous reading, and no modern moralist will agree with Madame de  S['e]vign['e] that \"bad books are better than no books at all\"; but  Madame de S['e]vign['e] may have meant books written in a bad style, or  feeble books, and not books bad in the moral sense. However, I must  confess that when I was young, I read several books which I was told  afterward were very bad indeed. But I did not find this out until  somebody told me! The youthful mind must possess something of the  quality attributed to a duck's back! I recall that once \"The Confessions  of Rousseau\" was snatched suddenly away from me by a careful mother just  as I had begun to think that Jean Jacques was a very interesting man and  almost as queer as some of the people I knew. I believe that if I had  been allowed to finish the book, it would have become by some mental  chemical process a very edifying criticism of life.    \"Tom Jones\" I found in an attic and I was allowed to read it by a pious  aunt, whom I was visiting, because she mixed it up with \"Tom Brown of  Rugby\"; but I found it even more tiresome than \"Eric, or Little by  Little,\" for which I dropped it. I remember, too, that I was rather  shocked by some things written in the Old Testament; and I retorted to  my aunt's pronouncement that she considered \"the 'Arabian Nights' a  dangerous book,\" by saying that the Old Testament was the worst book I  had ever read; but I supposed \"people had put something into it when God  wasn't looking.\" She sent me home.    At home, I was permitted to read only the New Testament. On winter  Sunday afternoons, when there was nothing else to do, I became sincerely  attached to the Acts of the Apostles. And I came to the conclusion that  nobody could tell a short story as well as Our Lord Himself. The  Centurion was one of my favourite characters. He seemed to be such a  good soldier; and his plea, \"Lord, I am not worthy,\" flashes across my  mental vision every day of my life.    In the Catholic churches, a part of the Gospel is read every Sunday, and  carefully interpreted. This always interested me because I knew in  advance what the priest was going to read. Most of the children of my  acquaintance were taught their Scriptures through the International  Sunday-school lessons, and seemed to me to be submerged in the geography  of Palestine and other tiresome details. For me, reading as I did, the  whole of the New Testament was radiant with interest, a frankly human  interest. There were many passages that I did not pretend to understand,  sometimes because the English was obscure or archaic, and sometimes  because my mind was not equal to it or my knowledge too small. Whatever  may be the opinion of other people, mine is that the reading of the New  Testament in the simplicity of childhood, with the flower of intuition  not yet blighted, is one of the most beautiful of mental experiences. In  my own case, it gave a glow to life; it caused me to distinguish between  truth and fairy tales, between fact and fiction--and this is often very  difficult for an imaginative child.    This kind of reading implies leisure and the absence of distraction.  Unhappily, much leisure does not seem to be left for the modern child.  The unhappy creature is even told that there will be \"something in  Heaven for children to do!\" As to distractions, the modern child is  surrounded by them; and it appears to be one of the main intentions of  the present system of instruction not to leave to a child any moments of  leisure for the indulgence of the imagination. But I am not offering the  example of my childhood for imitation by the modern parents.    Nevertheless, it had great consolations. There were no \"movies\" in those  days, and the theatre was only occasionally permitted; but on long  afternoons, after you had learned to read, you might lose yourself in  \"The Scottish Chiefs\" to your heart's content. It seems to me that the  beauty of this fashion of leisurely reading was that you had time to  visualize everything, and you felt the dramatic moments so keenly, that  a sense of unreality never obtruded itself at the wrong time. It was not  necessary for you to be told that Helen Mar was beautiful. It was only  necessary for her to say, in tones so entrancing that you heard them,  \"My Wallace!\" to know that she was the loveliest person in all Scotland.  But \"The Scottish Chiefs\" required the leisure of long holiday  afternoons, especially as the copy I read had been so misused that I  had to spend precious half hours in putting the pages together. It was  worth the trouble, however.    Before I could read, I was compelled on rainy days to sit at my mother's  knee and listen to what _she_ read. I am happy to say that she never  read children's books. Nothing was ever adapted to my youthful  misunderstanding. She read aloud what she liked to read, and she never  considered whether I liked it or not. It was a method of discipline. At  first, I looked drearily out at the soggy city street, in which rivulets  of melted snow made any exercise, suitable to my age, impossible. There  is nothing so hopeless for a child as an afternoon in a city when the  heavy snows begin to melt. My mother, however, was altogether regardless  of what happened outside of the house. At two o'clock precisely--after  the manner of the King in William Morris's \"Earthly Paradise\"--she waved  her wand. After that, all that I was expected to do was to make no  noise.    In this way I became acquainted with \"The Virginians,\" then running in  _Harper's Magazine_, with \"Adam Bede\" and \"As You Like It\" and \"Richard  III.\" and \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"Valentine  Vox\"--why \"Valentine Vox?\"--and other volumes when I should have been  listening to \"Alice in Wonderland.\" But when I came, in turn, to \"Alice  in Wonderland,\" I found Alice's rather dull in comparison with the  adventures of the Warrington brothers. And Thackeray's picture of Gumbo  carrying in the soup tureen! To have listened to Rebecca's description  of the great fight in \"Ivanhoe,\" to have lived through the tournament of  Ashby de la Zouche, was a poor preparation for the vagaries of the queer  creatures that surrounded the inimitable Alice.    There appeared to be no children's books in the library to which we had  access. It never seemed to me that \"Robinson Crusoe\" or \"Gulliver's  Travels\" or \"Swiss Family Robinson\" were children's books; they were not  so treated by my mother, and I remember, as a small boy, going up to  Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, with divine eagerness, to buy the  latest number of a Dickens serial. I think the name of the shop--the  shop of Paradise--which sold these books was called Ashburnham's. It may  be asked how the episode in \"Adam Bede\" of Hetty and that of \"little  Em'ly\" in Dickens struck the child mind. As I remember, the child mind  was awed and impressed, by a sense of horror, probably occasioned as  much by the force of the style, by the suggestions of an unknown terror,  as by any facts which a child could grasp.    It was a curious thing that my mother, who had remarkably good taste in  literature, admired Mrs. Henry Wood extravagantly. She also admired  Queen Victoria. She never read \"East Lynne\" aloud, because, I gathered,  she considered it \"improper\"; and Miss Braddon's \"Lady Audley's Secret\"  came under the same ban, though I heard it talked of frequently. It was  difficult to discover where my mother drew the line between what was  \"proper\" and what was \"not proper.\" Shakespeare she seemed to regard as  eminently proper, and, I noticed, hesitated and mumbled only when she  came to certain parts of Ophelia's song. It seems strange now that I  never rated Mrs. Henry Wood's novels with those of George Eliot or  Thackeray or Dickens. There seemed to be some imperceptible difference  which my mother never explained, but which I, instinctively, understood;  and when Anthony Trollope'"]]]
