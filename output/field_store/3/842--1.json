Here are the matchless tales of All-Father Odin, who crosses the Rainbow  Bridge to walk among men in Midgard and sacrifices his right eye to  drink from the Well of Wisdom; of Thor, whose mighty hammer defends  Asgard; of Loki, whose mischievous cunning leads him to treachery  against the gods; of giants, dragons, dwarfs and Valkyries; and of the  terrible last battle that destroyed their world.    These ancient stories from Northern Europe, which make up one of the  great myth cycles of Western civilization, spring to life in _The  Children of Odin_. This classic volume, first published in 1920 and  reissued in 1962, is now available for the first time in paperback,  illustrated with the original line drawings by Willy Pogany, to inspire  a new generation of readers.           *       *       *       *       *    The late Padraic Colum was a poet, playwright, founder of the _Irish  Review_ and a leader of the Irish Renaissance, but he is perhaps best  known today for his outstanding books for children.

Sol was the name of that Sun  and Mani was the name of that Moon. But always behind Sol and Mani  wolves went, a wolf behind each. The wolves caught on them at last and  they devoured Sol and Mani. And then the world was in darkness and cold.    In those times the Gods lived, Odin and Thor, Hoedur and Baldur, Tyr and  Heimdall, Vidar and Vali, as well as Loki, the doer of good and the doer  of evil. And the beautiful Goddesses were living then, Frigga, Freya,  Nanna, Iduna, and Sif. But in the days when the Sun and Moon were  destroyed the Gods were destroyed too--all the Gods except Baldur who  had died before that time, Vidar and Vali, the sons of Odin, and Modi  and Magni, the sons of Thor.    At that time, too, there were men and women in the world. But before the  Sun and the Moon were devoured and before the Gods were destroyed,  terrible things happened in the world. Snow fell on the four corners of  the earth and kept on falling for three seasons. Winds came and blew  everything away. And the people of the world who had lived on in spite  of the snow and the cold and the winds fought each other, brother  killing brother, until all the people were destroyed.    Also there was another earth at that time, an earth green and beautiful.  But the terrible winds that blew leveled down forests and hills and  dwellings. Then fire came and burnt the earth. There was darkness, for  the Sun and the Moon were devoured. The Gods had met with their doom.  And the time in which all these things happened was called Ragnaroek, the  Twilight of the Gods.    Then a new Sun and a new Moon appeared and went traveling through the  heavens; they were more lovely than Sol and Mani, and no wolves followed  behind them in chase. The earth became green and beautiful again, and in  a deep forest that the fire had not burnt a woman and a man wakened up.  They had been hidden there by Odin and left to sleep during Ragnaroek,  the Twilight of the Gods.    Lif was the woman's name, and Lifthrasir was the man's. They moved  through the world, and their children and their children's children made  people for the new earth. And of the Gods were left Vidar and Vali, the  sons of Odin, and Modi and Magni, the sons of Thor; on the new earth  Vidar and Vali found tablets that the older Gods had written on and had  left there for them, tablets telling of all that had happened before  Ragnaroek, the Twilight of the Gods.    And the people who lived after Ragnaroek, the Twilight of the Gods, were  not troubled, as the people in the older days were troubled, by the  terrible beings who had brought destruction upon the world and upon men  and women, and who from the beginning had waged war upon the Gods.          [Illustration]    THE BUILDING OF THE WALL      Always there had been war between the Giants and the Gods--between the  Giants who would have destroyed the world and the race of men, and the  Gods who would have protected the race of men and would have made the  world more beautiful.    There are many stories to be told about the Gods, but the first one that  should be told to you is the one about the building of their City.    The Gods had made their way up to the top of a high mountain and there  they decided to build a great City for themselves that the Giants could  never overthrow. The City they would call \"Asgard,\" which means the  Place of the Gods. They would build it on a beautiful plain that was on  the top of that high mountain. And they wanted to raise round their  City the highest and strongest wall that had ever been built.    Now one day when they were beginning to build their halls and their  palaces a strange being came to them. Odin, the Father of the Gods, went  and spoke to him. \"What dost thou want on the Mountain of the Gods?\" he  asked the Stranger.    \"I know what is in the mind of the Gods,\" the Stranger said. \"They would  build a City here. I cannot build palaces, but I can build great walls  that can never be overthrown. Let me build the wall round your City.\"    \"How long will it take you to build a wall that will go round our City?\"  said the Father of the Gods.    \"A year, O Odin,\" said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24750"],[0,"Mizora: A Prophecy (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net              MIZORA:    A PROPHECY.

Bradley.          PREFACE.      The narrative of Vera Zarovitch, published in the _Cincinnati  Commercial_ in 1880 and 1881, attracted a great deal of attention. It  commanded a wide circle of readers, and there was much more said about  it than is usual when works of fiction run through a newspaper in weekly  installments. Quite a number of persons who are unaccustomed to  bestowing consideration upon works of fiction spoke of it, and grew  greatly interested in it.    I received many messages about it, and letters of inquiry, and some  ladies and gentlemen desired to know the particulars about the  production of the story in book form; and were inquisitive about it and  the author who kept herself in concealment so closely that even her  husband did not know that she was the writer who was making this stir in  our limited literary world.    I was myself so much interested in it that it occurred to me to make the  suggestion that the story ought to have an extensive sale in book form,  and to write to a publisher; but the lady who wrote the work seemed  herself a shade indifferent on the subject, and it passed out of my  hands and out of my mind.    It is safe to say that it made an impression that was remarkable, and  with a larger audience I do not doubt that it would make its mark as an  original production wrought out with thoughtful care and literary skill,  and take high rank.                                    Yours very truly,                                        Murat Halstead.    _Nov. 14th, 1889._          PART FIRST          CHAPTER I.      Having little knowledge of rhetorical art, and possessing but a limited  imagination, it is only a strong sense of the duty I owe to Science and  the progressive minds of the age, that induces me to come before the  public in the character of an author. True, I have only a simple  narration of facts to deal with, and am, therefore, not expected to  present artistic effects, and poetical imagery, nor any of those flights  of imagination that are the trial and test of genius.    Yet my task is not a light one. I may fail to satisfy my own mind that  the true merits of the wonderful and mysterious people I discovered,  have been justly described. I may fail to interest the public; which is  the one difficulty most likely to occur, and most to be regretted--not  for my own sake, but theirs. It is so hard to get human nature out of  the ruts it has moved in for ages. To tear away their present faith, is  like undermining their existence. Yet others who come after me will be  more aggressive than I. I have this consolation: whatever reception may  be given my narrative by the public, I know that it has been written  solely for its good. That wonderful civilization I met with in Mizora, I  may not be able to more than faintly shadow forth here, yet from it, the  present age may form some idea of that grand, that ideal life that is  possible for our remote posterity. Again and again has religious  enthusiasm pictured a life to be eliminated from the grossness and  imperfections of our material existence. The Spirit--the Mind--that  mental gift, by or through which we think, reason, and suffer, is by one  tragic and awful struggle to free itself from temporal blemishes and  difficulties, and become spiritual and perfect. Yet, who, sweeping the  limitless fields of space with a telescope, glancing at myriads of  worlds that a lifetime could not count, or gazing through a microscope  at a tiny world in a drop of water, has dreamed that patient Science  and practice could evolve for the living human race, the ideal life of  exalted knowledge: the life that I found in Mizora; that Science had  made real and practicable. The duty that I owe to truth compels me to  acknowledge that I have not been solicited to write this narrative by my  friends; nor has it been the pastime of my leisure hours; nor written to  amuse an invalid; nor, in fact, for any of those reasons which have  prompted so many men and women to write a book. It is, on the contrary,  the result of hours of laborious work, undertaken for the sole purpose  of benefiting Science and giving encouragement to those progressive  minds who have already added their mite of knowledge to the coming  future of the race. \"We owe a duty to posterity,\" says Junius in his  famous letter to the king. A declaration that ought to be a motto for  every schoolroom, and graven above every legislative hall in the world.  It should be taught to the child as soon as reason has begun to dawn,  and be its guide until age has become its master.    It is my desire not to make this story a personal matter; and for that  unavoidable prominence which is given one's own identity in relating  personal experiences, an indulgence is craved from whomsoever may peruse  these pages.    In order to explain how and why I came to venture upon a journey no  other of my sex has ever attempted, I am compelled to make a slight  mention of my family and nationality.    I am a Russian: born to a family of nobility, wealth, and political  power. Had the natural expectations for my birth and condition been  fulfilled, I should have lived, loved, married and died a Russian  aristocrat, and been unknown to the next generation--and this narrative  would not have been written.    There are some people who seem to have been born for the sole purpose of  becoming the playthings of Fate--who are tossed from one condition of  life to another without wish or will of their own. Of this class I am an  illustration. Had I started out with a resolve to discover the North  Pole, I should never have succeeded. But all my hopes, affections,  thoughts, and desires were centered in another direction, hence--but my  narrative will explain the rest.    The tongue of woman has long been celebrated as an unruly member, and  perhaps, in some of the domestic affairs of life, it has been  unnecessarily active; yet no one who gives this narrative a perusal, can  justly deny that it was the primal cause of the grandest discovery of  the age.    I was educated in Paris, where my vacations were frequently spent with  an American family who resided there, and with whom my father had formed  an intimate friendship. Their house, being in a fashionable quarter of  the city and patriotically hospitable, was the frequent resort of many  of their countrymen. I unconsciously acquired a knowledge and admiration  for their form of government, and some revolutionary opinions in regard  to my own.    Had I been guided by policy, I should have kept the latter a secret, but  on returning home, at the expiration of my school days, I imprudently  gave expression to them in connection with some of the political  movements of the Russian Government--and secured its suspicion at once,  which, like the virus of some fatal disease, once in the system, would  lose its vitality only with my destruction.    While at school, I had become attached to a young and lovely Polish  orphan, whose father had been killed at the battle of Grochow when she  was an infant in her mother's arms. My love for my friend, and sympathy  for her oppressed people, finally drew me into serious trouble and  caused my exile from my native land.    I married at the age of twenty the son of my father's dearest friend.  Alexis and I were truly attached to each other, and when I gave to my  infant the name of my father and witnessed his pride and delight, I  thought to my cup of earthly happiness, not one more drop could be  added.    A desire to feel the cheering air of a milder climate induced me to pay  my Polish friend a visit. During my sojourn with her occurred the  anniversary of the tragedy of Grochow, when, according to custom, all  who had lost friends in the two dreadful battles that had been fought  there, met to offer prayers for their souls. At her request, I  accompanied my friend to witness the ceremonies. To me, a silent and  sympathizing spectator, they were impressive and solemn in the extreme.  Not less than thirty thousand people were there, weeping and praying on  ground hallowed by patriot blood. After the prayers were said, the voice  of the multitude rose in a mournful and pathetic chant. It was rudely  broken by the appearance of the Russian soldiers.    A scene ensued which memory refuses to forget, and justice forbids me to  deny. I saw my friend, with the song of sorrow still trembling on her  innocent lips, fall bleeding, dying from the bayonet thrust of a Russian  soldier. I clasped the lifeless body in my arms, and in my grief and  excitement, poured forth upbraidings against the government of my  country which it would never forgive nor condone. I was arrested, tried,  and condemned to the mines of Siberia for life.    My father's ancient and princely lineage, my husband's rank, the wealth  of both families, all were unavailing in procuring a commutation of my  sentence to some less severe punishment. Through bribery, however, the  co-operation of one of my jailors was secured, and I escaped in disguise  to the frontier.    It was my husband's desire that I proceed immediately to France, where  he would soon join me. But we were compelled to accept whatever means  chance offered for my escape, and a whaling vessel bound for the  Northern Seas was the only thing I could secure passage upon with  safety. The captain promised to transfer "]]]
