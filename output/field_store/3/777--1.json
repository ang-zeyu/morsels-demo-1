In Summer quite the other way,          I find it very hot all day,      But Human People do not care,          For they have nice thin clothes to wear.        And does it not seem hard to you,          When all the world is like a stew,      And I am much too warm to purr,          I have to wear my Winter Fur?          [Illustration]    Rain          The rain is raining everywhere,          Kittens to shelter fly--      But Human Folk wear overshoes,          To keep their hind paws dry.          [Illustration]    The Shadow Kitten          There's a funny little kitten that tries to look like me,          But though I'm round and fluffy, he's as flat as flat can be;      And when I try to mew to him he never makes a sound,          And when I jump into the air he never leaves the ground.        He has a way of growing, I don't understand at all.          Sometimes he's very little and sometimes he's very tall.      And once when in the garden when the sun came up at dawn          He grew so big I think he stretched half-way across the lawn.          [Illustration]    Education          When People think that Kittens play,         It's really quite the other way.      For when they chase the Ball or Bobbin         They learn to catch a Mouse or Robin.        The Kitten, deaf to Duty's call,         Who will not chase the bounding ball,      A hungry Cathood will enjoy,         The scorn of Mouse and Bird and Boy.          [Illustration]    A Thought          It's very nice to think of how      In every country lives a Cow      To furnish milk with all her might      For Kittens' comfort and delight.          [Illustration]    The Lion          The Lion does not move at all,          Winter or Summer, Spring or Fall,      He does not even stretch or yawn,          But lies in silence on the lawn.        He must be lazy it is plain,          For there is moss upon his mane,      And what is more, a pair of Daws          Have built a nest between his paws.        Oh, Lazy Lion, big and brown,          This is no time for lying down!      The Sun is shining, can't you see?          Oh, please wake up and play with me.          [Illustration]    The Milk Jug          The Gentle Milk Jug blue and white          I love with all my soul,      She pours herself with all her might          To fill my breakfast bowl.        All day she sits upon the shelf,          She does not jump or climb--      She only waits to pour herself          When 'tis my supper-time.        And when the Jug is empty quite,          I shall not mew in vain,      The Friendly Cow, all red and white,          Will fill her up again.          [Illustration]    Happy Thought          The world is so full of a number of Mice      I'm sure that we all should be happy and nice.          [Illustration]    Kitten's Night Thought          When Human Folk put out the light,         And think they've made it dark as night,      A Pussy Cat sees every bit         As well as when the lights are lit.        When Human Folk have gone upstairs,         And shed their skins and said their prayers,      And there is no one to annoy,         Then Pussy may her life enjoy.        No Human hands to pinch or slap,         Or rub her fur against the nap,      Or throw cold water from a pail,         Or make a handle of her tail.        And so you will not think it wrong         When she can play the whole night long,      With no one to disturb her play,         That Pussy goes to bed by day.          [Illustration]    The Puncture          When I was just a Kitten small,          They gave to me a Rubber Ball      To roll upon the floor.          One day I tapped it with my paw      And pierced the rubber with my claw;          Now it will roll no more.          [Illustration]    Good and Bad Kittens          Kittens, you are very little,          And your kitten bones are brittle,      If you'd grow to Cats respected,          See your play be not neglected.        Smite the Sudden Spool, and spring          Upon the Swift Elusive String,      Thus you learn to catch the wary          Mister Mouse or Miss Canary.        That is how in Foreign Places          Fluffy Cubs with Kitten faces,      Where the mango waves sedately,          Grow to Lions large and stately.        But the Kittencats who snatch          Rudely for their food, or scratch,      Grow to Tomcats gaunt and gory,--          Theirs is quite another story.        Cats like these are put away          By the dread S. P. C. A.,      Or to trusting Aunts and Sisters          Sold as Sable Muffs and Wristers.          [Illustration]          [Illustration]    Anticipation          When I grow up I mean to be      A Lion large and fierce to see.      I'll mew so loud that Cook in fright      Will give me all the cream in sight.      And anyone who dares to say      \"Poor Puss\" to me will rue the day.      Then having swallowed him I'll creep      Into the Guest Room Bed to sleep.          [Illustration]    Foreign Kittens          Kittens large and Kittens small,      Prowling on the Back Yard Wall,      Though your fur be rough and few,      I should like to play with you.      Though you roam the dangerous street,      And have curious things to eat,      Though you sleep in barn or loft,      With no cushions warm and soft,      Though you have to stay out-doors      When it's cold or when it pours,      Though your fur is all askew--      How I'd like to play with you!          [Illustration]    The Joy Ride          When Mistress Peggy moves around,          Her dresses make a mocking sound.      \"You can't catch me!\" they seem to say--          I often steal a ride that way.          [Illustration]    Facilis Ascensus          Up into the Cherry Tree,          Who should climb but little me,      With both my Paws I hold on tight,          And look upon a pleasant sight.        There are the Gardens far away,          Where little Foreign Kittens play,      And those queer specks of black and brown          Are naughty cats that live in Town.        And there among the tulips red,          Where I may never lay my head,      I see the Cruel Gardener hoe          The baby weeds that may not grow.        Now I climb down--\"Oh dear,\"--I mew,          \"Which end goes first--what shall I do?      Oh, good Kind Gardener, big and brown,          Please come and help this Kitten down.\"          [Illustration]    The Whole Duty of Kittens          When Human Folk at Table eat,         A Kitten must not mew for meat,      Or jump to grab it from the Dish,         (_Unless it happens to be fish_).          [Illustration]    The Outing          My Bed is like a little Bark,         The hatch is battened down,      And in the basket cabin dark         I sail away from Town.        Now, when they lift the lid, a scene         Of wonder meets my eyes,      Tall waving Feather-Dusters green,         That seem to touch the skies.        And over all the Ground is spread         A Rug of Emerald sweet,      Most deep enough to hide my head         And tickly to my feet.        And here's the Cow, calm-eyed stands she,         The Genie of the Jug,      Beneath the Feather-Duster Tree,         And eats the Emerald Rug.

INTRODUCTION      In the preparation of a book of this nature, to be used in the grade  schools, we realize that the one fundamental thing to keep in mind is  the economic importance of the insect, be it good or bad. The child  wants to know what is good and what is bad and how he can make use of  the good and how he can get rid of the bad. And yet there is something  more associated with the life, work and development of each tiny insect.  There is a story--a story of growth, not unlike that of the developing  child, a story of courage, strife and ultimate success or failure, which  is as interesting and of greater value to the child than many of the  stories of adventure and of historical facts. Snatches of these stories  will appear in the following chapters along with the studies on insects  and their economic importance.    In the development of our grade school system, especially in the rural  districts, there is a growing demand for some practical work along with  the regular cultural studies. To the child in the rural schools,  practical knowledge naturally tends toward agriculture. Many of these  boys and girls do not have a chance to pursue studies beyond the grades  and it therefore becomes necessary to introduce some elementary  agriculture into the grades to supply the natural craving of this vast  assemblage of children in the rural schools of our land.    In the search for a study which will give unlimited scope for  independent thought and observation and which will lead the child to  understand better the forces of nature that affect agriculture, nothing  is so readily available and attractive to the child as nature study, an  elementary study of the natural sciences. In fact agriculture is  primarily a course in nature study where we study how plants and animals  struggle for existence.    There is a period in the life of every child when he is especially  susceptible to the \"call of the fields;\" when he roams through woods or  by shady brooks gathering flowers, fishing for mud-cats and cleaning out  bumble-bees' nests. It is often compared with the life of the savage and  is merely the outward expression of an inward craving for a closer  relation with nature and her creatures. If one can reach a child while  at that age he has a ready listener and an apt pupil. That is the time  to guide and instruct the child along the line of nature study.    The most important questions confronting the average teacher in the  grade schools are: \"What material shall I use and how shall I proceed to  direct the child along this line?\" First of all use that material which  is most readily available, which is most familiar to the child and  which will attract and hold his attention. There is nothing so readily  available and so generally interesting to both boys and girls as are the  thousands of fluttering, buzzing, hopping and creeping forms of insects.  They are present everywhere, in all seasons and are known to every child  of the city or farm. They are easily observed in the field and can be  kept in confinement for study. Many of them are of the greatest  importance to man; a study of them becomes of special value.    In pursuing a study of nature and her creatures one should go into the  woods and fields as much as possible and study them where they are  found. In this way one can determine how they live together, what they  feed on and the various other questions which the inquisitive mind of a  healthy child will ask. When field work is not possible, gather the  insects and keep them alive in jars where they can be fed and observed.  Some forms cannot be kept in confinement and in such cases samples  should be killed and pinned, thereby forming a collection for study.    Most of the forms which are included in the following chapters can be  kept in confinement in glass jars or studies out doors. The studies have  been made so general that in case the particular form mentioned is not  available any closely related form can be used. Each child should make a  small collection of living and pinned insects for study and should be  encouraged to observe insects and their work in the field. The  collections and many of the observations could be made to good advantage  during the summer vacation when the insects are most abundant and  active.    Pupils should not be encouraged merely to make observations, but they  should be required to record them as well. Brief descriptions of the  appearance and development of insects, the injury they do, and remedies  for the same, will help fix in mind facts which otherwise might soon be  forgotten. Drawings, whenever possible, should also be required. The  pupil who can record observations accurately with drawings will not soon  forget them. The teacher should therefore require each pupil to provide  himself with a note-book for keeping brief, but accurate notes and  careful drawings. The drawings should be made with a hard lead pencil on  un-ruled paper, the size of the note-book, and the pupils should be  encouraged to be neat and accurate.    The author wishes to take this opportunity of expressing his deep  appreciation for the many helpful suggestions and other assistance which  Mr. R. H. Emberson, superintendent of Boys and Girls Club Work in  Missouri, has given. It was his life-long devotion to the boys and girls  of the grade schools and his keen appreciation of their needs that lead  him first to suggest to the author the importance of preparing this  little book for their use.

It lays open before us another world, of      which we have been hitherto unconscious, and shows us that the      tiniest insect, so small perhaps that the unaided eye can scarcely      see it, has its work to do in the world, and does it._\"                                            --REV.
