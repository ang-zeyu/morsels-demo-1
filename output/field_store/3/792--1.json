Y.          PREFACE    _To the Guide_      These Mother Carey Tales were written for children of all ages, who have  not outgrown the delight of a fairy tale. It might almost be said that  they were written chiefly for myself, for I not only have had the  pleasure of telling them to the little ones, and enjoying their quick  response, but have also had the greater pleasure of thinking them and  setting them down.    As I write, I look from a loved window, across a landscape that I love,  and my eye rests on a tall beautiful pine planted with my own hands  years ago. It is a mass of green fringes, with gem-like tips of buds and  baby cones, beautiful, exquisitely beautiful, whether seen from afar as  a green spire, or viewed close at hand as jewellery. It is beautiful,  fragile and--unimportant, as the world sees it; yet through its  wind-waved mass one can get little glimpses of the thing that backs it  all, the storm-defying shaft, the enduring rigid living growing trunk of  massive timber that gives it the nobility of strength, and adds value to  the rest; sometimes it must be sought for, but it always surely is  there, ennobling the lesser pretty things.    I hope this tree is a fair image of my fairy tale. I know my child  friends will love the piney fringes and the jewel cones, and they can  find the unyielding timber in its underlying truth, if they seek for it.  If they do not, it is enough to have them love the cones.    All are not fairy tales. Other chapters set forth things to see, thing  to do, things to go to, things to know, things to remember. These,  sanctified in the blue outdoors, spell \"Woodcraft,\" the one pursuit of  man that never dies or palls, the thing that in the bygone ages gifted  him and yet again will gift him with the seeing eye, the thinking hand,  the body that fails not, the winged soul that stores up precious  memories.    It is hoped that these chapters will show how easy and alluring, and how  good a thing it is.    While they are meant for the children six years of age and upward, it is  assumed that Mother (or Father) will be active as a leader; therefore it  is addressed, first of all, to the parent, whom throughout we shall call  the \"Guide.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Some of these stories date back to my school days, although the first  actually published was \"Why the Chicadee Goes Crazy Twice a Year.\" This  in its original form appeared in \"Our Animal Friends\" in September,  1893. Others, as \"The Fingerboard Goldenrod,\" \"Brook-Brownie,\" \"The  Bluebird,\" \"Diablo and the Dogwood,\" \"How the Violets Came,\" \"How the  Indian Summer Came,\" \"The Twin Stars,\" \"The Fairy Lamps,\" \"How the  Littlest Owl Came,\" \"How the Shad Came,\" appeared in slightly different  form in the _Century Magazine_, 1903 and 1904.           *       *       *       *       *    My thanks are due to the Authorities of the American Museum who have  helped me with specimens and criticism; to the published writings of Dr.  W. J. Holland and Clarence M. Weed for guidance in insect problems; to  Britton and Browne's \"Illustrated Flora, U. S. and Canada\"; and to the  Nature Library of Doubleday, Page & Co., for light in matters botanic;  to Mrs. Daphne Drake and Mrs. Mary S. Dominick for many valuable  suggestions, and to my wife, Grace Gallatin Seton, for help with the  purely literary work.    Also to Oliver P. Medsger, the naturalist of Lincoln High School, Jersey  City, N. J., for reading with critical care those parts of the  manuscript that deal with flowers and insects, as well as for the ballad  of the Ox-eye, the story of its coming to America, and the photograph of  the Mecha-meck.

Tooks Court, Chancery Lane, London.          GENERAL PREFACE.      This series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the  great English Cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide  books at a popular price. The aim of each writer has been to produce a  work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value  to the student of archaeology and history, and yet not too technical in  language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each  case would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the  general sources of information which have been almost invariably found  useful are:--firstly, the great county histories, the value of which,  especially in questions of genealogy and local records, is generally  recognized; secondly, the numerous papers by experts which appear from  time to time in the transactions of the antiquarian and archaeological  societies; thirdly, the important documents made accessible in the  series issued by the Master of the Rolls; fourthly, the well-known  works of Britton and Willis on the English Cathedrals; and, lastly,  the very excellent series of Handbooks to the Cathedrals, originated  by the late Mr. John Murray, to which the reader may in most cases be  referred for fuller detail, especially in reference to the histories  of the respective sees.

The authorities consulted in the preparation of this book are too  numerous to quote in detail. But the admirable works by the late Rev.  W.H. Jones have been proved so full of useful information that the  service they rendered must be duly acknowledged, although in almost  every instance further reference was made to the building itself--or  to officially authenticated documents. Nor must the help of one of the  cathedral cicerones be overlooked, in spite of his desire to remain  anonymous; for his knowledge of the building served to correct several  mistakes in the first edition. One moot point concerning the bishop  commemorated by an effigy in the North Choir Aisle is left an open  question. Local authorities insist that it should be attributed to  Bishop Poore, antiquarians of distinction affirm that it represents  Bishop Bingham.    The illustrations, with the exception of a few details from Britton  and Carter, are from photographs most courteously placed at my  disposal by Mrs. H. Snowden Ward, or from the series published by  Messrs. S.B. Bolas and Co., Carl Norman and Co. (now The Photochrom  Company, Ltd.), Poulton and Sons (of Lee) and Witcomb and Son, of  Salisbury, in each case duly acknowledged below the engraving.
