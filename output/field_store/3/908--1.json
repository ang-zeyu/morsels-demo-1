WYMAN BURY    _Author of \"The Land of Us,\" \"Arabia Infelix.\"_    MACMILLAN AND CO., LIMITED  ST. MARTIN'S STREET, LONDON  1919          TO    MY WIFE          PREFACE      I have written this book to present the main factors of a many-sided  problem--political, social and religious--in a form which the general  public can easily grasp.    Modern democratic principles tend to give the public increasing control  of international and inter-racial affairs, and therefore any  contribution to public knowledge on such questions is in the interests  of sound administration.    The book is not intended to advise those who actually handle these  affairs: I give such advice, when required, in more detail and not  through the medium of a published work.    \"Pan-Islam\" is an elementary handbook, not a text-book--still less an  exhaustive treatise, but the questions it discusses are real enough. My  qualifications for writing it are based on a quarter of a century's  experience of the subject in most parts of the Moslem world, and I have  studied the question in areas which I have not actually visited through  intercourse with pilgrims from those parts.    I have no axe to grind or infallible panacea to advocate; I merely lay  the result of my researches before the public for its information, as  failing health has warned me to \"pass the ball when collared,\" and I  would like to think that the land where most of my life's work has  centred will not be mishandled by cranks and opportunists after I have  left the game.    An arm-chair is a sorry substitute for an Arab pony, and a garden plot  for the highlands of Arabia Felix, but the human mind is not necessarily  confined by such trammels, and if my environment is narrow I hope my  book is not.

I presuppose that Christians or Moslems who read this book have got  beyond the stage of calling each other pagans or _kafirs_, and it will  have served its purpose if it brings about a friendlier feeling between  the two great militant creeds whose adherents have confronted together  many a stricken field.    Most people have heard of the pan-Islamic movement, especially during  the War. Some of us have called it a political bogey and some a  world-menace, but these are extremist views--it is really the practical  protest of Moslems against the exploitation of their spiritual and  material resources by outsiders.    Pan-Islam (as its name implies) is a movement to weld together Moslems  throughout the world regardless of nationality. The ethics and ideals of  Islam are more attainable to ordinary human beings than those of  Christianity: whether it is better to aim high and score a partial  success or aim lower and achieve is a matter of personal opinion and  need not be discussed here, but one tangible fact stands out--that  Islam, with its easier moral standard and frequent physical discipline  of attitudes and observances connected with obligatory prayer, enters  far more into the daily life of its adherents than Christianity does  with us. Hence pan-Islam is more than a spiritual movement: it is a  practical, working proposition which has to be reckoned with when  dealing with Moslems even in secular matters.    Pan-Islam is no new thing--it is as old as the Hejira, and then helped  to knit together Moslem Arabs against their pagan compatriots who were  persecuting them. In the palmy days of the Abbaside Caliphate it was  quiescent enough, and men of all creeds were welcomed at Baghdad for  their art, learning, or handicraft when we were massacring Jews in  London as part of a coronation pageant.    Medieval Moslems never fanned the movement into flame as long as they  were let alone, and even now tribes living beyond the scope of  missionaries and traders prefer the Christian traveller whom they know  to the Moslem stranger from the coast whom they usually distrust, and  who, to do him justice, seldom ventures among them, unless compelled by  paramount self-interest, generally in connection with some European  scheme or other.    Hitherto pan-Islam had been an instinctive and entirely natural  _riposte_ to the menace or actual aggression of non-Moslems; it assumed  the character of a definite organisation under the crafty touch of that  wily diplomat Abdul Hamid, once called by harsh critics \"the Damned,\"  though his efforts in that direction have been quite eclipsed by more  recent exponents.    In extreme evangelical circles it used to be frequently urged that  pan-Islam was a bugbear discovered, if not created, by one of India's  most eminent Viceroys, whose remarks thereon are said to have given  Abdul Hamid the hint. This method of eliminating a danger by denying its  existence has been discredited, since 1914, as completely as the  somewhat similar one (attributed to Mississippi engineers) of sitting on  the safety-valve just too long for safety. Moreover, in view of Abdul's  undoubted ability, he probably discovered for himself its efficacy as a  weapon of reprisal when hard pressed by pertinacious and inquisitive  Ambassadors, for he often found himself much embarrassed in his dealings  with Armenia and other domestic affairs by the intrusions of the more  formidable Christian Powers.    Great Britain naturally felt the point of this weapon most as governing  wide Moslem territories, and one can imagine some such interview as  this:    \"Frontier rectifications, my dear Sir Nicholas? By all means--and,  talking about frontiers, I do hope affairs are quite quiet now on your  north-west frontier; I take such an interest in my East Indian  correspondence.\"    And those Britons who have handled Oriental affairs for the last twenty  years can appreciate the extent of that interest when we remember that  even while Yamen Arabs were fighting the Turks, their neighbours on the  Aden side of the frontier were praying in their mosques that the Sultan  and his troops might be victorious \"by land and sea.\"    All this, however, was merely playing with intrigue as a political  counterpoise; it remained for a Christian nation to put pan-Islam on a  business footing. First we have polite bagmen calling at Stamboul with  German guns and a German military system. Then \"our Mr. William\" of the  well-known Potsdam firm of Hohenzollern and Sons made his great  advertising campaign in the Near East; many of us remembered his  theatrical visit to Saladin's tomb and the tawdry wreath with its  bombastic inscription, \"From the Emperor of the Franks to the Emperor of  the Saracens--Greeting.\"    That astute \"pilgrim\" made himself especially affable to the American  Protestant missionaries in the Holy Land, preached to a small but select  congregation at the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and posed alternately  as a pious but militant Moslem (when Hajji Guiyaum rode in military pomp  into Jerusalem) and as a prince of peace. That the hospice of Kaiserin  Augusta Victoria on the top of the Mount of Olives was loop-holed for  musketry and mounted a searchlight in its tower that could signal with  Haifa was possibly due to some wayward caprice of the builder, but it  came in very useful later on. So did the scholarly researches of eminent  Germans in Sinai, assisted as they were by maps which the Anglo-Egyptian  authorities courteously placed at their disposal, and which formed a  basis for a more detailed survey of wells and routes.    But the old firm at Potsdam excelled itself in its representatives on  the Palestine coast. There was, for example, the German Consul at Haifa  famed for his culture and diplomacy (the Teutonic brand), who also spoke  Arabic, Turkish, French and English fluently. This gifted official  frequented native cafes, where he fraternised with the local Arabs and  conducted a vigorous verbal propaganda against the Entente. Then there  was the German engineer who wrecked the British railway scheme to  connect Haifa and Damascus and re-naturalised as a German citizen after  being American Consul. The Belgian Vice-Consul too, that merry Hun, who  was also agent for our Khedivial mail line. When the Turks came in  against us this good and faithful servant danced on the Belgian and  British flags and threw himself heart and soul into pan-Islamic  propaganda.    Nor must we overlook that reverend pastor and Koranic scholar who  distributed anti-Christian and more especially anti-British propaganda  by means of native emissaries. Last but not least, the Herr Direktor of  the Hejaz Railway, who was collecting railway material for Sinai before  war broke out.

Some shady trees leaned over it, and  rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side  we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate  at our master's house, which stood by the roadside; at the top of the  meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook  overhung by a steep bank.    While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat  grass. In the daytime I ran by her side, and at night I lay down close  by her. When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the  trees, and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove.    As soon as I was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to  work in the daytime, and come back in the evening.    There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older  than I was; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run  with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and  round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough  play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.    One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me  to come to her, and then she said:    \"I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts  who live here are very good colts, but they are cart-horse colts, and  of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred  and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and  your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your  grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I  think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up  gentle and good, and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good  will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even  in play.\"    I have never forgotten my mother's advice; I knew she was a wise old  horse, and our master thought a great deal of her. Her name was Duchess,  but he often called her Pet.    Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and  kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children.  We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw  him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him. He would  pat and stroke her and say, \"Well, old Pet, and how is your little  Darkie?\" I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give  me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a  carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him, but I think we  were his favorites. My mother always took him to the town on a market  day in a light gig.    There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck  blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted he would  have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at  them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop  off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.    One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the  next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge  he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a  box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as  we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on.    \"Bad boy!\" he said, \"bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first  time, nor the second, but it shall be the last. There--take your money  and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again.\" So we never saw  Dick any more. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just  as gentle as our master, so we were well off.          02 The Hunt      Before I was two years old a circumstance happened which I have never  forgotten. It was early in the spring; there had been a little frost in  the night, and a light mist still hung over the woods and meadows. I  and the other colts were feeding at the lower part of the field when  we heard, quite in the distance, what sounded like the cry of dogs. The  oldest of the colts raised his head, pricked his ears, and said, \"There  are the hounds!\" and immediately cantered off, followed by the rest of  us to the upper part of the field, where we could look over the hedge  and see several fields beyond. My mother and an old riding horse of our  master's were also standing near, and seemed to know all about it.    \"They have found a hare,\" said my mother, \"and if they come this way we  shall see the hunt.\"    And soon the dogs were all tearing down the field of young wheat next  to ours. I never heard such a noise as they made. They did not bark, nor  howl, nor whine, but kept on a \"yo! yo, o, o! yo! yo, o, o!\" at the top  of their voices. After them came a number of men on horseback, some of  them in green coats, all galloping as fast as they could. The old horse  snorted and looked eagerly after them, and we young colts wanted to be  galloping with them, but they were soon away into the fields lower  down; here it seemed as if they had come to a stand; the dogs left off  barking, and ran about every way with their noses to the ground.    \"They have lost the scent,\" said the old horse; \"perhaps the hare will  get off.\"    \"What hare?\" I said.    \"Oh! I don't know what hare; likely enough it may be one of our own  hares out of the woods; any hare they can find will do for the dogs and  men to run after;\" and before long the dogs began their \"yo! yo, o, o!\"  again, and back they came altogether at full speed, making straight for  our meadow at the part where the high bank and hedge overhang the brook.    \"Now we shall see the hare,\" said my mother; and just then a hare wild  with fright rushed by and made for the woods. On came the dogs; they  burst over the bank, leaped the stream, and came dashing across the  field followed by the huntsmen. Six or eight men leaped their horses  clean over, close upon the dogs. The hare tried to get through the  fence; it was too thick, and she turned sharp round to make for the  road, but it was too late; the dogs were upon her with their wild cries;  we heard one shriek, and that was the end of her. One of the huntsmen  rode up and whipped off the dogs, who would soon have torn her to  pieces. He held her up by the leg torn and bleeding, and all the  gentlemen seemed well pleased.    As for me, I was so astonished that I did not at first see what was  going on by the brook; but when I did look there was a sad sight; two  fine horses were down, one was struggling in the stream, and the other  was groaning on the grass. One of the riders was getting out of the  water covered with mud, the other lay quite still.    \"His neck is broke,\" said my mother.    \"And serve him right, too,\" said one of the colts.    I thought the same, but my mother did not join with us.    \"Well, no,\" she said, \"you must not say that; but though I am an old  horse, and have seen and heard a great deal, I never yet could make out  why men are so fond of this sport; they often hurt themselves, often  spoil good horses, and tear up the fields, and all for a hare or a fox,  or a stag, that they could get more easily some other way; but we are  only horses, and don't know.\"    While my mother was saying this we stood and looked on. Many of the  riders had gone to the young man; but my master, who had been watching  what was going on, was the first to raise him. His head fell back and  his arms hung down, and every one looked very serious. There was no  noise now; even the dogs were quiet, and seemed to know that something  was wrong. They carried him to our master's house. I heard afterward  that it was young George"]]]
