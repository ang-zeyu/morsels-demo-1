[_All Rights reserved._]            THE    CARE OF BOOKS      An Essay on the    Development of Libraries and    their Fittings, from the earliest times to    the end of the Eighteenth Century      By      JOHN WILLIS CLARK, M.A., F.S.A.      Registrary of the University    and formerly Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge      CAMBRIDGE    at the University Press    1901        Cambridge:      PRINTED BY J. AND C. F. CLAY,    AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS.        FRANCISCO AIDANO GASQUET    MONACHO BENEDICTINO    D.D.    MAGISTRO DISCIPULUS          PREFACE.      When engaged in editing and completing _The Architectural History of the  University and Colleges of Cambridge_, I devoted much time and attention  to the essay called _The Library_. The subject was entirely new; and the  more I looked into it, the more convinced did I become that it would well  repay fuller investigation than was then possible. For instance, I felt  certain that the Customs affecting monastic libraries would, if one could  only discover them, throw considerable light on collegiate statutes  relating to the same subject.    The _Architectural History_ having been published, I had leisure to study  libraries from my new point of view; and, while thus engaged, I  fortunately met with the admirable paper by Dom Gasquet which he modestly  calls _Some Notes on Medieval Monastic Libraries_. This brief essay--it  occupies only 20 pages--opened my eyes to the possibilities that lay  before me, and I gladly place on record here the debt I owe to the  historian to whom I have dedicated this book.    When I had the honour of delivering the Rede Lecture before the University  of Cambridge in June 1894, I attempted a reconstruction of the monastic  library, shewing its relationship, through its fittings, to the  collegiate libraries of Oxford and Cambridge; and I was also able,  following the example set by Dom Gasquet in the above-mentioned essay, to  indicate the value of illuminated manuscripts as illustrating the life of  a medieval student or scribe. In my lectures as Sandars Reader in  Bibliography, delivered before the University of Cambridge in 1900, I  developed the subject still further, extending the scope of my enquiries  so as to include the libraries of Greece and Rome.    In writing my present book I have availed myself freely of the three works  above mentioned. At the same time I have incorporated much fresh material;  and I am glad to take this opportunity of stating, that, with the single  exception of the Escorial, I have personally examined and measured every  building which I have had occasion to describe; and many of the  illustrations are from my own sketches.    I call my book an _Essay_, because I wish to indicate that it is only an  attempt to deal, in a summary fashion, with an extremely wide and  interesting subject--a subject, too, which might easily be subdivided into  separate heads each capable of more elaborate treatment. For instance,  with regard to libraries in Religious Houses, I hope to see a book  written, dealing not merely with the way in which the books were cared  for, but with the subjects most generally studied, as indicated to us by  the catalogues which have survived.    A research such as I have had to undertake has naturally involved the  co-operation of numerous librarians and others both in England and on the  Continent. From all these officials I have experienced unfailing courtesy  and kindness, and I beg them to accept this collective expression of my  gratitude. To some, however, I am under such particular obligations, that  I wish to mention them by name.    In the first place I have to thank my friends Dr Jackson of Trinity  College, Dr Sandys of S. John's College, Dr James of King's College, and  F. J. H. Jenkinson, M.A., University Librarian, for their kind help in  reading proofs and making suggestions. Dr Sandys devoted much time to the  revision of the first chapter. As my work deals largely with monastic  institutions it is almost needless to say that I have consulted and  received efficient help from my old friend W. H. St John Hope, M.A.,  Assistant Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries.    My researches in Rome were made easy to me by the unfailing kindness and  ready help accorded on every occasion by Father C. J. Ehrle, S.J., Prefect  of the Vatican Library. My best thanks are also due to Signor Rodolfo  Lanciani, to Professor Petersen of the German Archeological Institute,  Rome, and to Signor Guido Biagi of the Biblioteca Laurenziana, Florence.  At Milan Monsignor Ceriani of the Ambrosian Library was so kind as to have  the library photographed for my use.    The courteous officials who administer the great libraries of Paris with  so much ability, have assisted me in all my researches. I wish specially  to thank in this place M. Leopold Delisle and M. Leon Dorez of the  Bibliotheque Nationale; M. A. Franklin of the Bibliotheque Mazarine; M. H.  Martin of the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal; and M. A. Perate,  Sous-Conservateur du Chateau de Versailles.    I have also to thank Senor Ricardo Velasquez for his beautiful elevation  of the bookcases in the Escorial Library; Father J. van den Gheyn, S.J.,  of the Royal Library, Brussels, for his trouble in shewing me, and  allowing me to have photographed, several MSS. from the library under his  charge; my friends Mr T. G. Jackson, R.A., Architect, for lending me his  section of Bishop Cobham's library at Oxford; E. W. B. Nicholson, M.A.,  Librarian, and Falconer Madan, M.A., Sub-Librarian, in the Bodleian  Library, for information respecting the building and its contents; Mr F.  E. Bickley of the British Museum for much help in finding and examining  MSS.; and Lionel Cust, M.A., Director of the National Portrait Gallery,  for general direction and encouragement.    Messrs Macmillan have allowed me to use three illustrations which appear  in the first chapter; Mr Murray has given the same permission for the  woodcut of the carrells at Gloucester; and Messrs Blades for the  representation of James Leaver's book-press.    Lastly I wish to thank the staff of the University Press for using their  best efforts to produce the work rapidly and well, and for many acts of  personal kindness to myself.

Blakiston's Son & Co.              TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.      This translation was undertaken with the especial object of  facilitating the study of the native medicinal plants by the  numerous medical officers stationed at small posts throughout the  Philippines. In order to aid in the recognition of these plants,  the botanical descriptions have been revised to the extent of adding,  where possible, the size and shape of the plant, English name, length  of leaves, color of flowers, etc., in many instances supplying the  entire botanical description where it had been omitted on account of  general familiarity with the plant. Comparing the few analyses that I  have had an opportunity to make with corresponding ones in the native  works from which Dr. Tavera has taken his botanical descriptions,  I am impressed with the necessity for a revision of the Botany of the  Philippines. However, as the therapeutic properties of the flora are  of foremost interest to the medical profession I have not hesitated  to publish the book in its present form as an entering wedge, leaving  to those better fitted the great work of classifying the flora of  these islands in accordance with modern botanical science.    Dr. Tavera has faithfully described the Malay and Hindu therapeutics  of the present day, enriching his description by observations founded  on a long practice in Paris and in his own native Luzon. From this  potpourri of scientific therapeutics and ignorant, superstitious  drugging the interested physician will elicit not a few useful data  concerning the treatment of disease in the tropics, and at the same  time gain a more intimate knowledge of both the people and plants of  our new Asiatic possessions.    I take this occasion to gratefully acknowledge my obligations to  Mr. A. P. Tonielli, stenographer and translator of the Supreme Court  of the Philippines, for typewriting the manuscript of this translation.      Jerome B. Thomas, Jr.    Manila, P. I.            PREFACE.      Commissioned by His Majesty's Government to study the medicinal  plants of my native country, I returned there and spent two years in  collecting data regarding the use that the Filipinos make of their  plants in the treatment of disease. At the same time I collected and  carefully preserved some with the purpose of taking them to Europe, to  study their chemical composition in the laboratories of Paris under the  direction of the eminent men who had been my instructors in medicine.    The work I did in the Philippines was preliminary, a preparation  for the more extended study of the subject which I wished to make  in Paris, where I went with my notes and collection. Unfortunately,  upon leaving Manila, I confided the mounting and pressing of my  plants to an inexperienced person who stupidly placed in the midst  of them several succulent tubers which decomposed during the voyage  and spoiled the other plants. At the same time I received in Paris  an important collection of the vegetable drugs of the Philippines,  sent by my friend the pharmacist, M. Rosedo Garcia, and destined for  the World's Fair of 1889. I opened with great pleasure the wood and  zinc box in which the collection came, anticipating that I should be  able to carry out my plan of study and at the same time win for my  friend, Garcia, a well-deserved premium. Imagine my disappointment  upon finding that, by an unfortunate coincidence, his plants had  arrived in the same condition as mine, having also been packed with  tubers of ubi, gabi, etc., and several cocoanuts which had decomposed.    Many times since then I have tried to obtain from Manila, through  exchange or payment of money, a similar collection, but have been  unable to secure a single leaf of the plants I so desired. If in the  future I have the good fortune to procure any, I shall make a study  of those at hand and publish the results.    I herewith publish the results of my investigations and experiments  in Manila, where, especially in the neighboring towns of San Mateo  and San Miguel, I often had opportunities for using, with good  results, the plants of which this volume treats. I may add that in  spite of the limited means at my disposal in Manila and the short  time left me by my regular occupations I was able to conduct a few  laboratory experiments owing to which this work contains some personal  observations reinforcing those quoted from medical literature.    The flora of the Archipelago is known to-day through the works of  Fathers Blanco, Llanos, Fernandez del Villar and Naves, and of the  engineers Jordano, the brothers Vidal and Soler and others who have  brought such honor to Spanish science, preparing the way for the study  of the therapeutic and industrial applications of that wonderfully rich  plant life with which our islands have been endowed. Their works help  us to recognize the plants whose medicinal virtues are herein described  and it is to them I owe the botanical descriptions in this treatise.    Father Blanco, in describing certain plants, mentions their medicinal  uses in the Philippines, but his descriptions are few and very  deficient as one would expect in a work of the scope of his Flora. A  Jesuit of some reputation, Father Clain, published in Manila in 1712  a book entitled \"Remedios fáciles para diferentes enfermedades?\" in  which he speaks of the medicinal virtues of some of the indigenous  plants, almost the same ones that appear in another work, a frank  and pleasing little treatise written by Father Santa Maria. Father  Mercado is the only one who has written a special treatise on the  subject and his manuscript remained unedited until the Augustinian  Fathers of Manila published it in the last edition of Father Blanco's  \"Flora\"; but neither this work nor those of Clain or Santa Maria are  useful to a physician, nor are they as accurately written as works  of a scientific character should be. From time to time superficial  articles have appeared in the Manila papers regarding the virtues of  some plant or other and these books and articles comprise the whole  literature on the subject up to this time.    Some physicians regard with small favor the therapeutic application of  plants by the Filipino \"herb-doctors\" (curanderos) as being entirely  empirical. This disparagement is unjustified because in all the  most rational and scientific remedies that we make use of, the first  step towards the final development of their relative position among  remedies is due to empiricism which is founded on daily experience,  on observation of results obtained in specific cases, facts that  are handed down from father to son for generations. The scientific  explanation is lacking, but those first ideas frequently owing their  origin to chance, or, perhaps, to superstition, have often been based  upon the observation of facts which, although fortuitous, are none  the less positive.    Many of the plants mentioned in this book are official in the  Pharmacopoeia of India and we see no reason why their use should be  proscribed in the Philippines. Filipino physicians not only can but  should employ many indigenous plants in their therapeutics; in many  instances they would find them more useful than the exotics, which  are not always fresh and are commonly reduced in strength by long  keeping or damaged by some circumstance of voyage or climate. The  price is another argument in favor of the use of native drugs. If  the pharmacists would prepare extracts and keep on hand the crude  drugs most in demand the public would gain a great advantage and the  druggists be well repaid for their labor. Physicians and pharmacists  will surely understand these advantages and when finally one considers  that the patients generally prefer to be treated with native plants,  I feel justified in the hope that their use will spread rapidly in  the Philippines.
