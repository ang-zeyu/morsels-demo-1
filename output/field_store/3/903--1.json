[Transcriber's Note: This e-book is volume 5 of Thomas D'Urfey's _Wit  and Mirth: Or Pills to Purge Melancholy_, published in six volumes in  1719-20 by J. Tonson, London. It was prepared from a 1959 facsimile  reprint by Folklore Library Publishers, Inc., New York, of an 1876  reprint (publisher unidentified).    The 1719-20 edition was published in two issues. The first issue was  published under the title _Songs Compleat, Pleasant and Divertive_;  the second, under the _Wit and Mirth_ title. The 1876 reprint  apparently used a combination of the two issues, and volume 5 bears  the _Songs Compleat_ title. Moreover, the 1876 reprint was not an  exact facsimile of the 1719-20 edition, as the typography and music  notation were modernized. For more information on the various  editions, see Cyrus L.

Rafael Palma                      Senator for the Fourth District      In support of Bill No. 23 of the Senate in the sessions held by said                 body on the 22d and 25th of November, 1919                                         Manila                             Bureau of Printing                                    1919                THE WOMAN AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE      Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Senate:    I have seldom felt so proud of being a representative of the people  as now, when it gives me an opportunity to advocate a cause which can  not be represented or defended in this chamber by those directly and  particularly affected by it, owing to the leven of prejudice that the  beliefs and ideas of the past have left in the mind of modern man. The  cause of female suffrage is one sure to strike a sympathetic chord  in every unprejudiced man, because it represents the cause of the  weak who, deprived of the means to defend themselves, are compelled  to throw themselves upon the mercy of the strong.    But it is not on this account alone that this cause has my sympathy and  appeals to me. It has, besides, the irresistible attraction of truth  and justice, which no open and liberal mind can deny. If our action  as legislators must be inspired by the eternal sources of right,  if the laws passed here must comply with the divine precept to give  everybody his due, then we can not deny woman the right to vote,  because to do otherwise would be to prove false to all the precepts  and achievements of democracy and liberty which have made this century  what may be properly called the century of vindication.    Female suffrage is a reform demanded by the social conditions of our  times, by the high culture of woman, and by the aspiration of all  classes of society to organize and work for the interests they have  in common. We can not detain the celestial bodies in their course;  neither can we check any of those moral movements that gravitate with  irresistible force towards their center of attraction: Justice. The  moral world is governed by the same laws as the physical world, and  all the power of man being impotent to suppress a single molecule of  the spaces required for the gravitation of the universe, it is still  less able to prevent the generation of the ideas that take shape in the  mind and strive to attain to fruition in the field of life and reality.    It is an interesting phenomenon that whenever an attempt is made  to introduce a social reform, in accordance with modern ideas and  tendencies and in contradiction with old beliefs and prejudices,  there is never a lack of opposition, based on the maintenance of the  _statu quo_, which it is desired to preserve at any cost. As was to be  expected, the eternal calamity howlers and false prophets of evil raise  their fatidical voices on this present occasion, in protest against  female suffrage, invoking the sanctity of the home and the necessity  of perpetuating customs that have been observed for many years.    Frankly speaking, I have no patience with people who voice such  objections. If this country had not been one of the few privileged  places on our planet where the experiment of a sudden change of  institutions and ideals has been carried on most successfully,  without paralyzation or retrogression, disorganization or destruction,  I would say that the apprehension and fears of those who oppose this  innovation might be justified.    However, in less than a generation our country, shaken to its very  foundations by the great social upheavals known as revolutions,  has seen its old institutions crumble to pieces and other, entirely  new institutions rise in their place; it has seen theories, beliefs,  and codes of ethics, theretofore looked upon as immovable, give way  to different principles and methods based upon democracy and liberty,  and despite all those upheavals and changes which have brought about a  radical modification in its social and political structure, or rather  in consequence of the same, our people has become a people with modern  thoughts and modern ideals, with a constitution sufficiently robust  and strong to withstand the ravages of the struggle for existence,  instead of remaining a sickly and atrophied organism, afraid of  everything new and opposed to material struggles from fear of the  wrath of Heaven and from a passive desire to live in an ideal state  of peace and well-being.    In view of the fruitful results which those institutions of liberty  and democracy have brought to our country; and considering the  marked progress made by us, thanks to these same institutions, in  all the orders of national life, in spite of a few reactionists and  ultra-conservatives, who hold opinions to the contrary and regret the  past, I do not and can not, understand how there still are serious  people who seriously object to the granting of female suffrage,  one of the most vivid aspirations now agitating modern society.    I remember very well that in the past, not so very long ago, the same  apprehension and fears were felt with regard to higher education for  our women. How ridiculous--the same people argued--is it for woman  to study history, mathematics, philosophy, and chemistry, which are  not only superior to the assimilating power of her deficient brain,  but will make her presumptuous and arrogant and convert her into  a hybrid being without grace or strength, intolerable and fatuous,  with a beautiful, but empty head and a big, but dry heart! However,  we admitted the women to our high schools and universities and made  it possible for them to attain to the degree of bachelor of arts  and graduate in law, medicine, and other professions. Can it be said  that those women have perverted the homes of their parents or that,  when they married, they were a source of disgrace or scandal to their  husbands? We are now able to observe the results, and if these results  are found to be detrimental to the social and political welfare of  the country, it is our duty to undo what we have done and to return  to where we were before.    Fortunately, nobody would think of such a thing. From the most  cultured centers of population to the remotest villages, public opinion  fervently approves and applauds the education of women, and even the  most backward peasants send their daughters to the cities and go to the  greatest sacrifices imaginable in order to make it possible for them to  ascend to the highest pinnacles of knowledge. Though ignorant rustics,  they reason in their own rude way that woman and man are made of the  same clay, and refuse to believe that because it has been their fate  to have daughters instead of sons, they must condemn them to bear the  chains of ignorance, incapacitating them from being useful to their  families, society, and their country.    Education has not atrophied or impaired any of the fundamental  faculties of woman; on the contrary, it has enhanced and enriched  them. Far from being a constant charge to the family, the educated  woman has often been its sustain and support in times of great  need. The educated woman has not become a blue-stocking, that fatuous  creature imagined by certain elements, nor has she lost any of her  feminine charms by being able to argue and discuss on every subject  with the men. On the contrary, it seems to lend her an additional  grace and charm, because she understands us better and can make  herself better understood. Thank God, people are no longer ready to  cast ridicule upon what some used to consider the foolish presumption  of women to know as much as the men, and this is doubtless due to the  fact that the disastrous results predicted by the calamity howlers,  the terrible prophets of failure, have not materialized.    Very well; if you allow the instruction and education of woman  in all the branches of science, you must allow woman to take on  her place not only in domestic life, but also in social and public  life. Instruction and education have a twofold purpose; individually,  they redeem the human intellect from the perils of ignorance, and  socially they prepare man and woman for the proper performance of  their duties of citizenship. A person is not educated exclusively for  his or her own good, but principally to be useful and of service to  the others. Nothing is more dangerous to society than the educated  man who thinks only of himself, because his education enables him to  do more harm and to sacrifice everybody else to his convenience or  personal ambition. The real object of education is public service,  that is, to utilize the knowledge one has acquired for the benefit  and improvement of the society in which one is living.    In societies, therefore, where woman is admitted to all the  professions and where no source of knowledge is barred to her,  woman must necessarily and logically be allowed to take a part in  the public life, otherwise, her education would be incomplete or  society would commit an injustice towards her, giving her the means  to educate herself and then depriving her of the necessary power to  use that education for the benefit of society and collective progress.    I can not resist this conclusion. If woman is given equal opportunities  with man for educating herself; if she is encouraged to learn and  study the knowledge of the world and of life, it is but just that the  doors of public life should be thrown open to her in order to allow  her to play in it the part to which she is entitled.    In backward societies, woman is taught only such knowledge as she"]]]
