[Illustration]      In the history of English literature there is no name that inspires a  profounder melancholy than that of the \"marvellous boy\" Chatterton, of  whom it must be said that in genius he surpassed any one who ever died  so young, and that in suffering he had larger experience than almost any  one who has lived to old age. Shelley says of him:          \"'Mid others of less note came one frail form,          A phantom among men; companionless        As the last cloud of an expiring storm,          Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,          Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,        Aclaeon-like, and now he fled astray,          With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,        And his own thoughts along that rugged way      Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey.\"    And Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Southey, Scott, Kirke White,  Landor, Montgomery, and others, have laid immortal flowers upon his  tomb, to make the heart ache that we did not live in time to save the  \"sleepless soul\" from \"perishing in his pride.\"    Of the genius of poor Chatterton, Campbell says, \"I would rather lean to  the utmost enthusiasm of his admirers, than to the cold opinion of those  who are afraid of being blinded to the defects of the poems attributed  to Rowley, by the veil of obsolete phraseology which is thrown over  them. If we look to the ballad of Sir Charles Bawdin, and translate it  into modern English, we shall find its strength and interest to have no  dependence on obsolete words. The inequality of his various productions  may be compared to the disproportions of the ungrown giant. His works  had nothing of the definite neatness of that precocious talent which  stops short in early maturity. His thirst for knowledge was that of a  being taught by instinct to lay up materials for the exercise of great  and undeveloped powers. Even in his favorite maxim, that a man by  abstinence and perseverance might accomplish whatever he pleased, may be  traced the indications of a genius which nature had meant to achieve  immortality. Tasso alone can be compared to him as a juvenile prodigy.\"    Mrs. S. C. HALL gives us, in her \"Pilgrimages to English Shrines,\" in  the _Art Journal_, the following interesting sketches of scenes  connected with his history:--      THOMAS CHATTERTON.    CHATTERTON--poor Chatterton! We had been brooding sadly over his  fragment of a life, ending at seventeen--when ordinary lives begin--and  turning page after page of Horace Walpole's literary fooleries, to find  his explanations and apologies for want of feeling and sympathy, which  his flippant style, and heartless commentaries, illustrate to  perfection; and we closed, with an aching heart, the volumes of both the  parasite of genius, and him who was its mightiest creation and most  miserable victim:--        \"The marvellous boy who perished in his pride.\"    It was only natural for us to recall the many instances we have  ourselves known, during the past twenty years, or more, of sorrow and  distress among those who sought distinction in the thorny labyrinths of  literature;--those who        ----\"waged with Fortune an eternal war,      Checked by the scoff of Pride, by Envy's frown,      And Poverty's unconquerable bar;\"    and those who, after a brief struggle with untoward fate, left the  battle-field, to die, \"unpitied and unknown!\"    We have seen the career of a young literary man commenced with the first  grand requisite of all excellence worth achieving--ENTHUSIASM; high  notions of moral honor, and a warm devotedness to that \"calling\" which  lifts units to a pinnacle formed by the dry bones of hundreds slain. We  have seen that enthusiasm frozen by disappointment--that honor corrupted  by the contamination of dissipated men--that devotedness to THE CAUSE  fade away before the great want of nature--want of bread--which it had  failed to bestow. We have seen, ay, in one little year, the flashing eye  dimmed--the round cheek flattened--the bright, hopeful creature, who  went forth into the world--rejoicing like the sun to run his  course--dragged from the waters of our leaden Thames, a discolored  remnant of mortality--recognized only by the mother who looked to him  for all the world could give!    This is horrible--but it is a tragedy soon played out. There are  hundreds at this moment possessed of the _consciousness_ of power  without the _strength_ to use it. To such, a little help might lead to a  life of successful toil--perhaps the happiest life a man can lead. A  heritage of usefulness is one of peace to the last. We knew another  youth, of a more patient nature than he of whom we have just spoken. He  seemed never weary. We have witnessed his nightly toil; his daily labor;  the smiling patience with which he endured the sneers levelled, _only_  in English society, against \"_mere_ literary men.\" We remember when, on  the first day of every month, he used to haunt the booksellers' shops to  look over the magazines, cast his eyes down the table of contents, just  to see if \"his poem\" or \"his paper\" had been inserted--then lay them  down one after another with a pale sickly smile, expressive of  disappointment, and turn away with a look of gentle endurance. The  insertion of a sonnet, for which perhaps he might receive seven  shillings, would set him dreaming again of literary immortality; and at  last the dream was realized by an accident, or rather, to speak  advisedly, by a good Providence. He became known--known at once--blazed  forth; something he had written attracted the town's attention, and  ladies in crowded drawing-rooms stood upon chairs to see that poor,  worn, pale man of letters: and magazines, and grave reviews, and  gayly-bound albums, all waited for his contributions--charge what he  pleased; and flushed with fame, and weighed down with money--money paid  for the very articles that had been rejected without one civil line of  courtesy--the great sustaining hope of his life was realized; he married  one as worn and pale with the world's toil, as himself--married--and  died within a month! The tide was too tardy in turning!    Who shall say how many men of genius have walked, like unhappy  Chatterton, through the valley of the shadow of death, and found no  guide, no consolation--no hope; if, the one GREAT HOPE had not been most  mercifully planted early in their hearts and minds?    It was with melancholy pleasure that, during the past summer, our  Pilgrimage was made to the places connected with the boy's memory, in  Bristol; first to Colston's school, in which he was educated;[1] next to  the dull district in which he was either born or passed his boyhood;  then to the Institution, where his \"Will,\" a mad document, and other  memoranda connected with his memory, are preserved with a degree of  care, that seems--or is--a mockery, when contrasted with the worse than  indifference of the city to all that concerned him when alive; next to  the house of Master Canynge, and next to the monument (Redcliffe Church)  with which his name will be associated as long as one of its stones  remains upon another; chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancies  through its long-drawn aisles; pondering sadly in the muniment-room,  where the cofres that suggested the forgeries, still lie rotting; and  gazing with mingled sorrow and surprise on the \"Cenotaph to Chatterton,\"  which now, taken to pieces, occupies the corner of a damp vault--        \"A solemn cenotaph to thee,      Sweet Harper of time-shrouded minstrelsy!\"    Ah! such books as we have been reading, and such memories as we have  been recalling, are, after all, unprofitable--a darkness without light.  We closed our eyes upon the world, which, in our momentary bitterness,  we likened to one great charnel-house, entombing all things glorious and  bright. We walked to the window; the rain was descending in  torrents--pour, pour; pattens clattered in the areas, and a solitary  postman made the street echo with his impatient knocks. A poor  organ-boy, whom we have long known, was moving, rather than walking, in  the centre; his hat flapped over his eyes by the rain, yet still he  turned the handle, and the damp music crawled forth: he paused opposite  our door, turned up the leaf of his hat, and looked upward; we missed  the family of white mice which usually crawled on the top of his organ:  poor child, he had sheltered them in his bosom; it was nothing more than  natural that he should do so, and the act was commonplace enough--but it  pleased us--it diminished our gloom. And we thought, if the great ones  of the land would but foster the talent that needs, and deserves,  protection from the storms of life, as that lonely boy sheltered the  creatures intrusted to his care, the world would be all the better. We  do not mean to insult the memory of such a genius as Chatterton by  saying that he required a PATRON--the very sound is linked with a  servility that degrades a noble nature; but we do say he sadly wanted a  FRIEND--some one who could have understood and appreciated his wonderful  intellectual gifts; and whose strength of mind and position in society  would have given power to direct and control the overleaping and  indomitable pride which ultimately destroyed \"the Boy.\" His career  teaches a lesson of such rare value to all who seek distinction in any  sphere of life, that we would have it considered well--as a beacon to  warn from ruin.        \"Oh! what a tangled web we weave,      When"]]]
