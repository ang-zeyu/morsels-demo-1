I wish    to state definitely that the present work, the English    translation of which has been authorised and approved by    me, is the only authentic manual of the Montessori method,    and that the only other authentic or authorised works of    mine in the English language are \"The Montessori Method,\"    and \"Pedagogical Anthropology.\"                                      [Signed: Maria Montessori]          PREFACE      If a preface is a light which should serve to illumine the contents of  a volume, I choose, not words, but human figures to illustrate this  little book intended to enter families where children are growing up.  I therefore recall here, as an eloquent symbol, Helen Keller and Mrs.  Anne Sullivan Macy, who are, by their example, both teachers to  myself--and, before the world, living documents of the miracle in  education.    In fact, Helen Keller is a marvelous example of the phenomenon common  to all human beings: the possibility of the liberation of the  imprisoned spirit of man by the education of the senses. Here lies the  basis of the method of education of which the book gives a succinct  idea.    If one only of the senses sufficed to make of Helen Keller a woman of  exceptional culture and a writer, who better than she proves the  potency of that method of education which builds on the senses? If  Helen Keller attained through exquisite natural gifts to an elevated  conception of the world, who better than she proves that in the  inmost self of man lies the spirit ready to reveal itself?    Helen, clasp to your heart these little children, since they, above  all others, will understand you. They are your younger brothers: when,  with bandaged eyes and in silence, they touch with their little hands,  profound impressions rise in their consciousness, and they exclaim  with a new form of happiness: \"I see with my hands.\" They alone, then,  can fully understand the drama of the mysterious privilege your soul  has known. When, in darkness and in silence, their spirit left free to  expand, their intellectual energy redoubled, they become able to read  and write without having learnt, almost as it were by intuition, they,  only they, can understand in part the ecstasy which God granted you on  the luminous path of learning.

In all civilized countries, but especially in England,  statistics show a decrease in infant mortality.    Related to this decrease in mortality a corresponding improvement is  to be seen in the physical development of children; they are  physically finer and more vigorous. It has been the diffusion, the  popularization of science, which has brought about such notable  advantages. Mothers have learned to welcome the dictates of modern  hygiene and to put them into practice in bringing up their children.  Many new social institutions have sprung up and have been perfected  with the object of assisting children and protecting them during the  period of physical growth.    In this way what is practically a new race is coming into being, a  race more highly developed, finer and more robust; a race which will  be capable of offering resistance to insidious disease.    What has science done to effect this? Science has suggested for us  certain very simple rules by which the child has been restored as  nearly as possible to conditions of a natural life, and an order and a  guiding law have been given to the functions of the body. For example,  it is science which suggested maternal feeding, the abolition of  swaddling clothes, baths, life in the open air, exercise, simple short  clothing, quiet and plenty of sleep. Rules were also laid down for the  measurement of food adapting it rationally to the physiological needs  of the child's life.    Yet with all this, science made no contribution that was entirely new.  Mothers had always nursed their children, children had always "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29688"],[0,"Home Range and Movements of the Eastern Cottontail in Kansas (#1)"],[1,"OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS  MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY    Vol. 10, No. 7, pp. 553-572, 4 pls., 3 figs.

JANES      INTRODUCTION    A knowledge of the home range and movements of the cottontail  (_Sylvilagus floridanus_) is one of the most important prerequisites  for estimating effectively its numbers and managing its populations. By  comparing results obtained from different methods, previously used, for  determining the size of the home range I have attempted to develop a  more valid procedure.    The study here reported upon was made on the University of Kansas  Natural History Reservation (Sec. 4, T. 12S, R. 20E), the  northeasternmost section of Douglas County, Kansas, approximately 6-1/2  miles north-northeast of the University campus at Lawrence. The  590-acre reservation, situated in the ecotone between the eastern  deciduous forests and the prairie of the Great Plains near the north  edge of the Kansas River Valley, has been protected as a \"natural area\"  since 1948 (Fitch, 1952). It consists of tree-covered slopes, and flat  grass-covered hilltops and valleys. Two limestone outcrops follow the  contours about five and 20 feet below the tops of the hills.    The 90-acre study area consists of a valley bordered on the north by a  wooded slope and on the southeast by another wooded slope adjacent to a  narrow hilltop, east of which is another wooded slope. The area is thus  an alternating series of three wooded slopes and two grass-covered,  relatively level areas.    The wooded slopes rise from the valley for about 125 feet at a grade of  approximately 16 per cent. There is a sharp increase in grade to 36 per  cent 100 feet below the top of the hills. A natural terrace 50 feet to  100 feet wide parallels the hilltop at the base of the 36 per cent  incline.    The vegetation of the northwest-facing wooded slopes has been described  by Packard (1956). It consists of American elm (_Ulmus americana_),  shagbark hickory (_Carya ovata_), chestnut oak (_Quercus  muehlenbergii_), black oak (_Quercus velutina_), and black walnut  (_Juglans nigra_), in that order of dominance. Honey locust (_Gleditsia  triacanthos_) and hackberry (_Celtis occidentalis_) are also present.  Shrubs and herbs of the lower story include greenbriar (_Smilax  hispida_), wild grape (_Vitis vulpina_), Virginia creeper  (_Parthenocissus quinquefolia_), coralberry (_Symphoricarpos  orbiculatus_), gooseberry (_Ribes missouriense_), bluegrass (_Poa  pratensis_), sedges (_Carex_ sp.), poison ivy (_Rhus radicans_), and  white snakeroot (_Eupatorium rugosum_).    The flat hilltops are covered by a mixture of grasses and forbs but are  dominated by awnless brome (_Bromus inermis_). Foxtail (_Setaria  glauca_), false redtop (_Triodia flava_), and panic grass (_Panicum  clandestinum_) also occur commonly. Awnless brome is dominant in the  valley (Pl. 46, fig. 1; Pl 47, fig. 2) except in the eastern end where  bluegrass is dominant (Pl. 45).    Near the tops and bottoms of the slopes barbed wire fences separate the  woodlands from the grasslands, which were grazed until 1948. The  borderline between woods and grasslands is well defined but woody  plants are rapidly encroaching into the grasslands. Young Osage orange  (_Maclura pomifera_), American elm, and hackberry are common trees  encroaching on the grasslands. The edge vegetation between woods and  fields (Pls. 45 and 47) includes smooth sumac (_Rhus glabra_),  coralberry and wild plum (_Prunus americana_). The lowland edges are  characterized by blackberry (_Rubus argutus_), greenbriar and  elderberry (_Sambucus canadensis_). Plates 45, 46 and 47 all show local  habitat in situations where traps were actually operated. Fitch  (1952:8-22), Leonard and Goble (1952:1015-1026) and Martin  (1956:366-372) have described parts of the Reservation that include the  study area.    I am grateful to Professor Henry S. Fitch for guiding my work, to  Professor Rollin H. Baker for suggestions and encouragement in the  early part of the study, to Mr. Robert L. Packard for certain trapping  records that supplemented my own, and to Professor E. Raymond Hall for  valuable suggestions. Norma L. Janes, my wife, typed the manuscript.  Photographs were taken by me. The State Biological Survey of Kansas  provided funds, equipment, and transportation.      METHODS AND TECHNIQUES    Schwartz (1941), Dalke and Sime (1938), Dalke (1937 and 1942),  Hendrickson (1936), and Allen (1939) estimated the home range of the  cottontail by drawing, on a map, straight lines that connected all  marginal points of capture in live-traps. The resulting home ranges  were polygonal figures. Haugen (1942) altered this method by drawing  lines that connected points midway between the actual points of capture  and the next outermost traps in the grid. Fitch (1947) used a method  for enclosing all points of capture in a circle or ellipse that  represented the home range boundaries and expressed home range as the  diameter of these figures. Another method, which has been used to  determine the home range of birds, is to map the movements of an  individual as it is observed. Stebler (1939) suggested the use of  tracking records to determine home range. Connell (1954) expressed home  range of cottontails as the average distance traveled from a computed  center of activity. The method was originally proposed by Hayne (1949).    The methods used by other investigators to calculate the home range of  the cottontail have yielded estimates varying from 0.1 acre to 100  acres. Such wide variations in the estimated size of home range may  result from the use of different methods and from insufficient data.  The data obtained from live-trapping are not fully adequate because  traps cannot sample, in time and space, the entire home range of an  individual. Also, \"trap habit\" or \"trap shyness\" may distort the  apparent shape of the home range. In order to compare these methods I  have calculated home range from my data by each of five different  methods. The results are shown in Table 1.    No two methods yielded exactly the same results. To utilize all  available data for each individual, I recorded on a map the locations  of capture in live-traps, nests and forms, locations where the animal  was observed in the field and the routes that it took between them. At  the end of the study a line was drawn on the map to enclose the areas  where the cottontail was known to have been.    Live-traps were operated intermittently at 130 stations between  December 8, 1954, and February 10, 1956. Sixteen cottontails were  marked in the same area by Robert L. Packard in 1954. Data from 7850  trap nights were used in this study. The traps were set at fifty-foot  intervals and the pattern approximated that of a grid in habitat  favorable for cottontails such as at edges of woodland. In wooded areas  traps were placed at fifty-foot intervals parallel to the edges. Traps  were not set on areas of poor habitat where neither cottontails nor  their sign were observed.    The traps were operated eight to twelve days and closed for two to five  days intermittently throughout the trapping period except in the months  of April to August, 1955, when trapping was unsuccessful because the  cottontails then were not attracted by bait.    Two kinds of traps were used in my study: those made by the National  Live Trap Company and those described by Fitch (1950). Both types  performed well and were serviceable under ordinary field conditions.  Experiments were made periodically throughout the trapping period to  determine which bait was most attractive to cottontails and least  attractive to birds, rodents, skunks, raccoons, and opossums. All of  these animals hindered operations by stealing bait and springing traps.  Corn, scratch-feed, carrots, parsnips, tomatoes, lettuce, apple,  cabbage, raisins, sorghum, sugar candy, and onions were used as bait.  Corn and scratch-feed attracted cottontails best in all seasons. Corn  was superior to scratch-feed, which was quickly stolen by small birds  and rodents. Eighty-nine cottontails (40 females, 49 males) were  captured in the course of the study.    Cottontails were marked individually at the time of first capture. When  necessary, the markings were renewed at later captures; in all such  instances the same color codes and numbers were retained for each.  Markings were of four types: numbered ear tags, colored ear ribbons,  colored tail fur, and colored feet. It was intended to make each  individual cottontail recognizable in a trap or in the field.  Occasionally when a predator had killed and eaten a cottontail the tail  and feet remained and, when dyed, they provided important clues to the  identity of the individual. However, the color of the feet is not  ordinarily discernible in the field while the rabbit is alive.    Monel metal ear tags (size No. 4, National Band and Tag Co.) were  punched through the lateral or posterior fold of the ear close to its  base (Pl. 48), one in each ear as insurance against possible losses.  However, only three tags were pulled out of the ears and lost in the  course of this study. In no instance was identity of an individual  cottontail lost. The tags caused no damage to the ears over a period of  21 months.    Trailing in snow is an effective method of studying the daily  activities. The record preserved by the tracks becomes somewhat  confused"]]]
