[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2344"],[0,"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box (#1)"],[1,"Adventure of the Cardboard Box      By    Sir Arthur Conan Doyle          In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental  qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as  possible, to select those which presented the minimum of  sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents.  It is,  however, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational  from the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must  either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so  give a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which  chance, and not choice, has provided him with.  With this short preface  I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a  peculiarly terrible, chain of events.    It was a blazing hot day in August.  Baker Street was like an oven, and  the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across  the road was painful to the eye.  It was hard to believe that these  were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of  winter.  Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the  sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the  morning post.  For myself, my term of service in India had trained me  to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no  hardship.  But the morning paper was uninteresting.  Parliament had  risen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the  New Forest or the shingle of Southsea.  A depleted bank account had  caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the  country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.  He  loved to lie in the very center of five millions of people, with his  filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every  little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime.  Appreciation of nature  found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he  turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his  brother of the country.    Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside  the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown  study.  Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts:    \"You are right, Watson,\" said he.  \"It does seem a most preposterous  way of settling a dispute.\"    \"Most preposterous!\" I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he  had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and  stared at him in blank amazement.    \"What is this, Holmes?\" I cried.  \"This is beyond anything which I  could have imagined.\"    He laughed heartily at my perplexity.    \"You remember,\" said he, \"that some little time ago when I read you the  passage in one of Poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the  unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the  matter as a mere tour-de-force of the author.  On my remarking that I  was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed  incredulity.\"    \"Oh, no!\"    \"Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your  eyebrows.  So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a  train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading  it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been  in rapport with you.\"    But I was still far from satisfied.  \"In the example which you read to  me,\" said I, \"the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the  man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of  stones, looked up at the stars, and so on.  But I have been seated  quietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?\"    \"You do yourself an injustice.  The features are given to man as the  means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful  servants.\"    \"Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my  features?\"    \"Your features and especially your eyes.  Perhaps you cannot yourself  recall how your reverie commenced?\"    \"No, I cannot.\"    \"Then I will tell you.  After throwing down your paper, which was the  action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a  vacant expression.  Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly  framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your  face that a train of thought had been started.  But it did not lead  very far.  Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry  Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books.  Then you glanced  up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious.  You were  thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare  space and correspond with Gordon's picture there.\"    \"You have followed me wonderfully!\" I exclaimed.    \"So far I could hardly have gone astray.  But now your thoughts went  back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the  character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you  continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful.  You were  recalling the incidents of Beecher's career.  I was well aware that you  could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on  behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your  expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was  received by the more turbulent of our people.  You felt so strongly  about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of  that also.  When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the  picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War,  and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your  hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the  gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But  then, again, your face grew sadder, you shook your head.  You were  dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life.  Your  hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your  lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of  settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At  this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to  find that all my deductions had been correct.\"    \"Absolutely!\" said I.  \"And now that you have explained it, I confess  that I am as amazed as before.\"    \"It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you.  I should not  have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity  the other day.  But I have in my hands here a little problem which may  prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought  reading.  Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to  the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss  Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?\"    \"No, I saw nothing.\"    \"Ah! then you must have overlooked it.  Just toss it over to me. Here  it is, under the financial column.  Perhaps you would be good enough to  read it aloud.\"    I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the  paragraph indicated. It was headed, \"A Gruesome Packet.\"    \"Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the  victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical  joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to  the incident.  At two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet,  wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman.  A cardboard box  was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss  Cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly  severed.  The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the  morning before.  There is no indication as to the sender, and the  matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of  fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or  correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything  through the post.  Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge,  she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom  she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular  habits.  The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been  perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge  and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the  dissecting-rooms.  Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact  that one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the  best of Miss Cushing's belief, from Belfast.  In the meantime, the  matter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very  smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.\"    \"So much for the Daily Chronicle,\" said Holmes as I finished reading.  \"Now for our friend Lestrade.  I had a note from him this morning, in  which he says:    \"I think that this case is very much in your line.  We have every hope  of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting  anything to work upon.  We have, of course, wired to the Belfast  post-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that  day, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of  remembering the sender.  The box is a half-pound box of honeydew  tobacco and does not help us in any way.  The medical student theory  still appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a  few hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here.  I shall  be either at the house or in the police-station all day.    \"What say you, Watson?  Can you rise superior to the heat and run down  to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?\"    \"I was longing for something to do.\"    \"You shall have it then.  Ring for our boots and tell them to order a  cab.
