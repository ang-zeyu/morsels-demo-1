Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room;      And hermits are contented with their cells;      And students with their pensive citadels:      Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,      Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,      High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells,      Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:      In truth, the prison unto which we doom      Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,      In sundry moods 't was pastime to be bound      Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground;      Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)      Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,      Should find brief solace there, as I have found.                                             WORDSWORTH.                                 ON BOSTON COMMON.      Our Common and Garden are not an ideal field of operations for the  student of birds. No doubt they are rather straitened and public. Other  things being equal, a modest ornithologist would prefer a place where he  could stand still and look up without becoming himself a gazing-stock.  But \"it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps;\" and if we are  appointed to take our daily exercise in a city park, we shall very  likely find its narrow limits not destitute of some partial  compensations. This, at least, may be depended upon,--our  disappointments will be on the right side of the account; we shall see  more than we have anticipated rather than less, and so our pleasures  will, as it were, come to us double. I recall, for example, the  heightened interest with which I beheld my first Boston cat-bird;  standing on the back of one of the seats in the Garden, steadying  himself with oscillations of his tail,--a conveniently long  balance-pole,--while he peeped curiously down into a geranium bed,  within the leafy seclusion of which he presently disappeared. He was  nothing but a cat-bird; if I had seen him in the country I should have  passed him by without a second glance; but here, at the base of the  Everett statue, he looked, somehow, like a bird of another feather.  Since then, it is true, I have learned that his occasional presence with  us in the season of the semi-annual migration is not a matter for  astonishment. At that time, however, I was happily more ignorant; and  therefore, as I say, my pleasure was twofold,--the pleasure, that is, of  the bird's society and of the surprise.    There are plenty of people, I am aware, who assert that there are no  longer any native birds in our city grounds,--or, at the most, only a  few robins. Formerly things were different, they have heard, but now the  abominable English sparrows monopolize every nook and corner. These wise  persons speak with an air of positiveness, and doubtless ought to know  whereof they affirm. Hath not a Bostonian eyes? And doth he not cross  the Common every day? But it is proverbially hard to prove a negative;  and some of us, with no thought of being cynical, have ceased to put  unqualified trust in other people's eyesight,--especially since we have  found our own to fall a little short of absolute infallibility. My own  vision, by the way, is reasonably good, if I may say so; at any rate I  am not stone-blind. Yet here have I been perambulating the Public Garden  for an indefinite period, without seeing the first trace of a  field-mouse or a shrew. I should have been in excellent company had I  begun long ago to maintain that no such animals exist within our  precincts. But the other day a butcher-bird made us a flying call, and  almost the first thing he did was to catch one of these same furry  dainties and spit it upon a thorn, where anon I found him devouring it.  I would not appear to boast; but really, when I saw what Collurio had  done, it did not so much as occur to me to quarrel with him because he  had discovered in half an hour what I had overlooked for ten years. On  the contrary I hastened to pay him a heart-felt compliment upon his  indisputable sagacity and keenness as a natural historian;--a measure of  magnanimity easily enough afforded, since however the shrike might excel  me at one point, there could be no question on the whole of my  immeasurable superiority. And I cherish the hope that my fellow  townsmen, who, as they insist, never themselves see any birds whatever  in the Garden and Common (their attention being taken up with matters  more important), may be disposed to exercise a similar forbearance  toward me, when I modestly profess that within the last seven or eight  years I have watched there some thousands of specimens, representing not  far from seventy species.    Of course the principal part of all the birds to be found in such a  place are transient visitors merely. In the long spring and autumn  journeys it will all the time be happening that more or less of the  travelers alight here for rest and refreshment. Now it is only a  straggler or two; now a considerable flock of some one species; and now  a miscellaneous collection of perhaps a dozen sorts.    One of the first things to strike the observer is the uniformity with  which such pilgrims arrive during the night. He goes his rounds late in  the afternoon, and there is, no sign of anything unusual; but the next  morning the grounds are populous,--thrushes, finches, warblers, and what  not. And as they come in the dark, so also do they go away again. With  rare exceptions you may follow them up never so closely, and they will  do nothing more than fly from tree to tree, or out of one clump of  shrubbery into another. Once in a great while, under some special  provocation, they threaten a longer flight; but on getting high enough  to see the unbroken array of roofs, on every side they speedily grow  confused, and after a few shiftings of their course dive hurriedly into  the nearest tree. It was a mistake their stopping here in the first  place; but once here, there is nothing for it save to put up with the  discomforts of the situation till after sunset. Then, please heaven,  they will be off, praying never to find themselves again in such a  Babel.    That most of our smaller birds migrate by night is by this time too well  established to need corroboration; but if the student wishes to assure  himself of the fact at first hand, he may easily do it by one or two  seasons' observations in our Common,--or, I suppose, in any like  inclosure. And if he be blest with an ornithologically educated ear, he  may still further confirm his faith by standing on Beacon Hill in the  evening--as I myself have often done--and listening to the _chips_ of  warblers, or the _tseeps_ of sparrows, as these little wanderers, hour  after hour, pass through the darkness over the city. Why the birds  follow this plan, what advantages they gain or what perils they avoid by  making their flight nocturnal, is a question with which our inquisitive  friend will perhaps find greater difficulty. I should be glad, for one,  to hear his explanation.    As a rule, our visitors tarry with us for two or three days; at least I  have noticed that to be true in many cases where their numbers, or  size, or rarity made it possible to be reasonably certain when the  arrival and departure took place; and in so very limited a field it is  of course comparatively easy to keep track of the same individual during  his stay, and, so to speak, become acquainted with him. I remember with  interest several such acquaintanceships.    One of these was with a yellow-bellied woodpecker, the first I had ever  seen. He made his appearance one morning in October, along with a  company of chickadees and other birds, and at once took up his quarters  on a maple-tree near the Ether monument. I watched his movements for  some time, and at noon, happening to be in the same place again, found  him still there. And there he remained four days. I went to look at him  several times daily, and almost always found him either on the maple or  on a tulip tree a few yards distant. Without question the sweetness of  maple sap was known to _Sphyropicus varius_ long before our human  ancestors discovered it, and this particular bird, to judge from his  actions, must have been a genuine connoisseur; at all events he seemed  to recognize our Boston tree as of a sort not to be met with every day,  although to my less critical sense it was nothing but an ordinary  specimen of the common _Acer dasycarpum_. He was extremely industrious,  as is the custom of his family, and paid no attention to the children  playing about, or to the men who sat under his tree, with the back of  their seat resting against the trunk. As for the children's noise, he  likely enough enjoyed it; for he is a noisy fellow himself and famous as  a drummer.

PREFACE.    In preparing this work, our object has been to put into permanent  shape the few scattered reports of the Woman Suffrage Movement still  to be found, and to make it an arsenal of facts for those who are  beginning to inquire into the demands and arguments of the leaders of  this reform. Although the continued discussion of the political rights  of woman during the last thirty years, forms a most important link in  the chain of influences tending to her emancipation, no attempt at its  history has been made. In giving the inception and progress of this  agitation, we who have undertaken the task have been moved by the  consideration that many of oar co-workers have already fallen asleep,  and that in a few years all who could tell the story will have passed  away.    In collecting material for these volumes, most of those of whom we  solicited facts have expressed themselves deeply interested in our  undertaking, and have gladly contributed all they could, feeling that  those identified with this reform were better qualified to prepare a  faithful history with greater patience and pleasure, than those of  another generation possibly could.    A few have replied, \"It is too early to write the history of this  movement; wait until our object is attained; the actors themselves can  not write an impartial history; they have had their discords,  divisions, personal hostilities, that unfit them for the work.\"  Viewing the enfranchisement of woman as the most important demand of  the century, we have felt no temptation to linger over individual  differences. These occur in all associations, and may be regarded in  this case as an evidence of the growing self-assertion and  individualism in woman.    Woven with the threads of this history, we have given some personal  reminiscences and brief biographical sketches. To the few who, through  ill-timed humility, have refused to contribute any of their early  experiences we would suggest, that as each brick in a magnificent  structure might have had no special value alone on the road-side, yet,  in combination with many others, its size, position, quality, becomes  of vital consequence; so with the actors in any great reform, though  they may be of little value in themselves; as a part of a great  movement they may be worthy of mention--even important to the  completion of an historical record.    To be historians of a reform in which we have been among the chief  actors, has its points of embarrassment as well as advantage. Those  who fight the battle can best give what all readers like to know--the  impelling motives to action; the struggle in the face of opposition;  the vexation under ridicule; and the despair in success too long  deferred. Moreover, there is an interest in history written from a  subjective point of view, that may compensate the reader in this case  for any seeming egotism or partiality he may discover. As an  autobiography is more interesting than a sketch by another, so is a  history written by its actors, as in both cases we get nearer the soul  of the subject.    We have finished our task, and we hope the contribution we have made  may enable some other hand in the future to write a more complete  history of \"the most momentous reform that has yet been launched on  the world--the first organized protest against the injustice which has  brooded over the character and destiny of one-half the human race.\"          CONTENTS.
