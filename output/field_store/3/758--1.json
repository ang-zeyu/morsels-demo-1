PREFACE      The title of this book is not ambiguous, but as it relates to a subject  rarely thought about by the generality of people, it may save some  misapprehension if at once it is plainly stated that the following pages  are in vindication of a dietary consisting wholly of products of the  vegetable kingdom, and which therefore excludes not only flesh, fish,  and fowl, but milk and eggs and products manufactured therefrom.                                                          THE AUTHOR.      This work is reprinted from the English edition with changes better  adapting it to the American reader.                                                      THE PUBLISHERS.          MAN'S FOOD      Health and happiness are within reach of those who provide themselves  with good food, clean water, fresh air, and exercise.    A ceaseless and relentless hand is laid on almost every animal to  provide food for human beings.    Nothing that lives or grows is missed by man in his search for food to  satisfy his appetite.    Natural appetite is satisfied with vegetable food, the basis for highest  and best health and development.    History of primitive man we know, but the possibilities of perfected and  complete man are not yet attained.    Adequate and pleasant food comes to us from the soil direct, favorable  for health, and a preventive against disease.    Plant food is man's natural diet; ample, suitable, and available;  obtainable with least labor and expense, and in pleasing form and  variety.    Animal food will be useful in emergency, also at other times; still,  plant substance is more favorable to health, endurance, and power of  mind.    Variety of food is desirable and natural; it is abundantly supplied by  the growth of the soil under cultivation.    Races of intelligence and strength are to be found subsisting and  thriving on an exclusive plant grown diet.    The health and patience of vegetarians meet the social, mental and  physical tests of life with less disease, and less risk of dependence in  old age.    Meat eaters have no advantages which do not belong also to those whose  food is vegetable.    Plant food, the principal diet of the world, has one serious drawback;  it is not always savory, or palatable.    Plant diet to be savory requires fat, or oil, to be added to it; nuts,  peanut, and olive oil, supply it to the best advantage.    Plant diet with butter, cream, milk, cheese, eggs, lard, fat, suet, or  tallow added to it, is not vegetarian; it is mixed diet; the same in  effect as if meat were used.--Elmer Lee, M.D., Editor, Health Culture  Magazine.

Unfortunately many of those who _do_ realise the intimate connection  between diet and both physical and mental health, are not, generally  speaking, sufficiently philosophical to base their views upon a secure  foundation and logically reason out the whole problem for themselves.    Briefly, the pleas usually advanced on behalf of the vegetable regimen  are as follows: It is claimed to be healthier than the customary flesh  diet; it is claimed for various reasons to be more pleasant; it is  claimed to be more economical; it is claimed to be less trouble; it is  claimed to be more humane. Many hold the opinion that a frugivorous  diet is more natural and better suited to the constitution of man, and  that he was never intended to be carnivorous; that the slaughtering of  animals for food, being entirely unnecessary is immoral; that in adding  our share towards supplying a vocation for the butcher we are helping to  nurture callousness, coarseness and brutality in those who are concerned  in the butchering business; that anyone of true refinement and delicacy  would find in the killing of highly-strung, nervous, sensitive  creatures, a task repulsive and disgusting, and that it is scarcely  fair, let alone Christian, to ask others to perform work which we  consider unnecessary and loathsome, and which we should be ashamed to do  ourselves.    Of all these various views there is one that should be regarded as of  primary importance, namely, the question of health. First and foremost  we have to consider the question of physical health. No system of  thought that poses as being concerned with man's welfare on earth can  ever make headway unless it recognises this. Physical well-being is a  moral consideration that should and must have our attention before aught  else, and that this is so needs no demonstrating; it is self-evident.    Now it is not to be denied when we look at the over-flowing hospitals;  when we see everywhere advertised patent medicines; when we realise  that a vast amount of work is done by the medical profession among all  classes; when we learn that one man out of twelve and one woman out of  eight die every year from that most terrible disease, cancer, and that  over 207,000 persons died from tuberculosis during the first seven years  of the present century; when we learn that there are over 1500 defined  diseases prevalent among us and that the list is being continually added  to, that the general health of the nation is far different from what we  have every reason to believe it ought to be. However much we may have  become accustomed to it, we cannot suppose ill-health to be a _normal_  condition. Granted, then, that the general health of the nation is far  from what it should be, and looking from effects to causes, may we not  pertinently enquire whether our diet is not largely responsible for this  state of things? May it not be that wrong feeding and mal-nutrition are  at the root of most disease? It needs no demonstrating that man's health  is directly dependent upon what he eats, yet how few possess even the  most elementary conception of the principles of nutrition in relation to  health? Is it not evident that it is because of this lamentable  ignorance so many people nowadays suffer from ill-health?    Further, not only does diet exert a definite influence upon physical  well-being, but it indirectly affects the entire intellectual and moral  evolution of mankind. Just as a man thinks so he becomes, and 'a  science which controls the building of brain-cell, and therefore of  mind-stuff, lies at the root of all the problems of life.' From the  point of view of food-science, mind and body are inseparable; one reacts  upon the other; and though a healthy body may not be essential to  happiness, good health goes a long way towards making life worth living.  Dr. Alexander Haig, who has done such excellent and valuable work in the  study of uric acid in relation to disease, speaks most emphatically on  this point: 'DIET is the greatest question for the human race, not only  does his ability to obtain food determine man's existence, but its  quality controls the circulation in the brain, and this decides the  trend of being and action, accounting for much of the indifference  between depravity and the self-control of wisdom.'    The human body is a machine, not an iron and steel machine, but a blood  and bone machine, and just as it is necessary to understand the  mechanism of the iron and steel machine in order to run it, so is it  necessary to understand the mechanism of the blood and bone machine in  order to run it. If a person understanding nothing of the business of a  _chauffeur_ undertook to run an automobile, doubtless he would soon come  to grief; and so likewise if a person understands nothing of the needs  of his body, or partly understanding them knows not how to satisfy them,  it is extremely unlikely that he will maintain it at its normal  standard of efficiency. Under certain conditions, of which we will speak  in a moment, the body-machine is run quite unconsciously, and run well;  that is to say, the body is kept in perfect health without the aid of  science. But, then, we do not now live under these conditions, and so  our reason has to play a certain part in encouraging, or, as the case  may be, in restricting the various desires that make themselves felt.  The reason so many people nowadays are suffering from all sorts of  ailments is simply that they are deplorably ignorant of their natural  bodily wants.

This series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great  English Cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide books at a  popular price. The aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled  with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of  archaeology and history, and yet not too technical in language for the use  of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case  would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general  sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful  are:--firstly, the great county histories, the value of which, especially  in questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognized;  secondly, the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in  the transactions of the antiquarian and archaeological societies; thirdly,  the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master  of the Rolls; fourthly, the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the  English Cathedrals; and, lastly, the very excellent series of Handbooks to  the Cathedrals, originated by the late Mr. John Murray, to which the  reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in  reference to the histories of the respective sees.

R.C.

CHAPTER I.    THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING.      More than four hundred years passed by between the beginning of the  building of this cathedral by Archbishop Lanfranc (1070-1089) and its  completion, by the addition of the great central tower, at the end of the  fifteenth century. But before tracing the history of the construction of  the present well-known fabric, a few words will not be out of place  concerning the church which preceded it on the same site. A British or  Roman church, said to have been built by a certain mythical King Lucius,  was given to St. Augustine by Ethelbert in A.D. 597. It was designed,  broadly speaking, on the plan of the old Basilica of St. Peter at Rome,  but as to the latest date of any alterations, which may or may not have  been made by Augustine and his immediate successors, we have no accurate  information. It is, however, definitely stated that Archbishop Odo, who  held the see from A.D. 942-959, raised the walls and rebuilt the roof. In  the course of these alterations the church was roofless for three years,  and we are told that no rain fell within the precincts during this time.  In A.D. 1011 Canterbury was pillaged by the Danes, who carried off  Archbishop Alphege to Greenwich, butchered the monks, and did much damage  to the church. The building was, however, restored by Canute, who made  further atonement by hanging up his crown within its walls, and bringing  back the body of Alphege, who had been martyred by the Danes. In"]]]
