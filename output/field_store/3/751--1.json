Professor of Entomology in Rutgers College, &c.    PUBLISHED BY THE BROOKLYN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY  BROOKLYN, N. Y.  1906    PRESS OF THE NEW ERA PRINTING COMPANY  LANCASTER, PA.    {Scanner's note: This book is about a century old at the time of  scanning.  I found it in the discard pile of a local university library.  I  find the book to be of exceptional historical interest in the insights it  gives into the development of early modern entomological science.  It  also is of practical value as a source for terms that are obscure to  modern users because they are no longer current.    I have edited the text as well as I could and I think it is by now very  usable, but do treat any really suspicious looking passages with  reserve.  I have avoided the use of non-alphabetic symbols as far as I  could, for example Greek letters and male, female and hermaphroditic  symbols, but if you encounter difficulties you might find the  problem there.  Also, the colour table at the end is not really much  good for anything beyond general impressions; not only are the paper  and ink old, but between my scanner and your screen or printer, there  is room for too much misinterpretation of precise colour, for anyone to  take it seriously.    In any case, enjoy.  The book is a valuable product of serious workers  in an age of exploration.}        FOREWORD.    When, some time since, in consequence of continuing demands, the  Brooklyn Entomological Society resolved to publish a new edition of  its Explanation of Terms used in Entomology, and entrusted the  writer and two associates with the task of preparing the same, it was  believed that a little revision of definitions, the dropping of a few  obsolete terms and the addition of a few lately proposed, would be all  that was necessary. It was to be a light task to fill idle time in  summer, report to be made in fall. Two years have passed since that  time; the associates have dropped by the way; the manuscript  contains five times the number of terms in the original \"Explanation.\"  and if it is published now, it is not because I believe it to be complete;  but because I do not believe it can be made complete except as the  result of criticism and voluntary addition by specialists throughout  the country.    It is twenty-six years since the original list was published and nothing  can better illustrate the advances made than a comparison between  the old and the new Glossary. No one realizes better than I the fact  that as students have increased in each order, each has followed an  independent line of research, absolutely without regard to the work  done elsewhere. In consequence, we have several terms for the same  thing in many cases and, in an equal number, several meanings to the  same term. As no one man can now-a-days cover the entire field of  Entomology, it goes without saying that I was compelled to rely partly  upon books and partly upon the good nature of correspondents to  make the work even approximately complete.    The first notable contribution came from Professor Justus W. Folsom,  of Urbana, Illinois, who sent me over 2000 cards of terms collected by  himself and his assistants, and these added materially at the  beginning of the work.  A number of correspondents were good enough  to send in lists of terms in Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera,  Hemiptera and Neuroptera, and to refer me to literature where  explanations of other special terms could be found.    After the cards were so far advanced as to warrant a preliminary  manuscript, Dr. Philip P. Calvert of the University of Pennsylvania.  Mr. Nathan Banks of Washington, D.C., and Mr. C. W. Johnson of  the Boston Society of Natural History went carefully over the entire  work and by their criticisms and additions contributed materially to  such merit as it possesses. To these gentlemen and to the many  others not specifically mentioned I give thanks for their assistance,  and if there have not been more co-workers it has been only because  of the time element that seems to demand the best that is ready,  rather than a delay to secure perfection.    It would be interesting to go at length into the history of the  correspondence to determine what sort of terms should or should not  be included and to bring out the hopeless divergencies existing; but  all that is important here is to state briefly what has been included  and what omitted.    Common English terms even if descriptive, when used in their  ordinary dictionary sense, have not been included as a rule; but this  is subject to many exceptions. Latin terms and derivatives, even if  used in their usual sense have been generally included; but  compounds made up of adequately defined descriptive terms are  generally omitted. Adverbial or adjective forms have been omitted  whenever it has been considered safe, and so have terms prefixed by  sub-, supra- and the like, indicating degree or position. In doubtful  cases the terms have been included and defined. All terms of venation  are, so far as possible, reduced to the Comstock system which is the  only one that has been satisfactorily worked out for all orders, and a  series of figures is added to explain this system so far as seems  necessary. It has not been considered feasible to determine the proper  use of terms applied differently in different orders or families; that is  scarcely within the scope of a work of this kind.    Terms used in embryological and histological study have been  included only so far as seemed necessary to an understanding of the  general works, and no attempt has been made to cover the terms  applied to musculature and other details of microscopic structure:  this has seemed rather to be outside of the scope of the present essay.    All color terms are reduced so far as possible to terms of the  Windsor and Newton system of water colors which are standard in the  English-speaking world, and the color plate shows solid blocks of  those colors that seem necessary to explain all modifications except  metallics, blacks and whites. {Scanner's note: color plate may be  excluded, partly because it is in poor condition.}    The figures illustrating body structures and other details have been  drawn under my supervision by Mr. John A. Grossbeck, and are  meant to be guides merely - else the glossary would exceed its scope.    In the admission that the work is incomplete, no apology is intended  for its publication; it is merely a statement of fact to encourage  constructive rather than destructive criticism. It is hoped that those  who note errors or omissions will communicate them to the writer so  that when another edition is needed, as it will be before many years  are past, a standard work may be possible.        JOHN B. SMITH, Sc.D.    New Brunswick,  N.J.  April 1906          EXPLANATORY.    Definitions of general application are as a rule given first, where  more than one is necessary; next those of limited use, and finally  the specific meaning in each order in which there is any notable  difference.    Where a word has more than one ending, the difference is given after a  hyphen which represents the stem word: e.g. ametabola -ous; the  latter in place of ametabolous, which indicates the possession of the  characters peculiar to the ametabola. Where there is an English and a  Latin ending, the former is usually given with the word and the other  is added: e.g. aequilate -us, instead of aequilatus, there being no  difference in the application. Usually the singular form of the word  is first given, and the plural ending is added; e.g.         antenna -ae,         cenchrus -ri,         desideratum -ata;    but occasionally, when the plural is more commonly used, e.g.  epimera -eron, this is reversed and the singular ending is added: when  the two are different in form, e.g. foot and feet, the words are given  separately, and so when there is a difference in the application, as in         uncus and unci.    In the definition of color terms the words in brackets [ ] refer to the  equivalent color as named on the plate, or the combination needed to  produce it.    The names in parentheses ( ) are those of the writers whose definitions  are used, or who have used the term in the sense defined. In the  terms of venation, these parentheses occur most frequently.    Most of the signs and abbreviations are those in common use         :=     equal to, or the same as;         q.v.   which see;         pl.    plural;         abb.   abbreviated.    The abbreviated names are: Comst. for Comstock; Coq. for  Coquillett; Meig. for Meigen; Nort. for Norton: O. S. for  Osten-Sacken: and Will. for Williston.      A    A: prefix, is privative; wanting or without.    Ab: off; away from.    Abbreviated: cut short; not of usual length.    Abdomen: the third or posterior division of the insect body: consists  normally of nine or ten apparent segments, but actual number is a  mooted question: bears no functional legs in the adult stage.    Abdominal: belonging or pertaining to the abdomen.    Abdominal feet: see pro-legs.    Abdominal groove: the concave lobe of the inner margin of secondaries  enveloping the abdomen beneath, in some butterflies.    Abdominal pouch: in female Parnassiids, a sac-like ventral cavity,  formed by material secreted during copulation.    Abductor: applied to muscles that open out or extend an appendage or  draw it away from the body: see adductor.    Abductor mandibulae: the muscle that opens the mandibles.    Aberrant: unusual; out of the ordinary course.    Aberration: a form that departs in some striking way from the normal  type; either single or occurring rarely, at irregular intervals.    Abiogenesis: spontaneous generation.    Abnormal: outside the usual range or course; not normal.    Aborted: a structure developed so as to be unfit for its normal function  obsolete or atrophied.
