W.P. 15      [Illustration: Theseus and the Minotaur.    _Frontispiece_]      DEDICATED  TO  ARNOLD, HELEN, AND EDWARD          PREFACE.      This elementary history of Greece is intended for supplementary reading  or as a first history text-book for young pupils. It is therefore made  up principally of stories about persons; for, while history proper is  largely beyond the comprehension of children, they are able at an early  age to understand and enjoy anecdotes of people, especially of those in  the childhood of civilization. At the same time, these stories will give  a clear idea of the most important events that have taken place in the  ancient world, and, it is hoped, will arouse a desire to read further.  They also aim to enforce the lessons of perseverance, courage,  patriotism, and virtue that are taught by the noble lives described.    A knowledge of ancient history, however superficial, is of very great  value; and the classic legends are almost equally worth knowing, because  of the prominent part they play in the world's literature. These tales  make a deep impression on the minds of children, and the history thus  learned almost in play will cling to the memory far more tenaciously  than any lessons subsequently conned.    Many children leave school unacquainted with any history except that of  the United States; which, dealing with less simple and primitive times  than that of Greece, is apt to be so unattractive that the child never  afterwards reads any historical works. It has been my intention to write  a book which will give children pleasure to read, and will thus  counteract the impression that history is uninteresting.    A few suggestions to teachers may not be considered superfluous. In the  first place, I have found historical anecdotes an excellent aid in  teaching English. Pupils find it far from irksome to relate the stories  in their own words, and to reproduce them in compositions. Secondly,  whenever a city or country is mentioned, every pupil should point out  its location on the map. By such means only can any one properly  understand an historical narrative; and in the present case there is the  added reason that the practice will go far towards increasing the  child's interest in geography. Lastly, the teacher should take great  care that the proper names are correctly pronounced. The most common  errors are provided against in the text; for, on the first occurrence of  such a word, it is divided into syllables, with the accent marked. It  remains for the teacher to enforce the ordinary rules as to the proper  sounds of vowels and consonants.      H.A.G.

Reid collects together a group  of six men who would pay to take part in an expedition, camping and  hunting, into the prairies.  They take with them a couple of paid men,  professionals who would give them very necessary guidance.  They all  make a pact that they would each tell a round of tales around the camp  fire, such stories to be amusing and instructive.    Reid himself is something of a naturalist, as we can learn from his many  other books.  We are given these tales just as they are told, in good  English if told by an educated man, and in the dialect of the less  educated ones.  This latter arrangement makes the checking of the OCR  transcriptions a little difficult, but never mind.    What people may find a little tedious is Reid's habit of giving the  naturalists' Latin names for the various animals and plants described.    ________________________________________________________________________  THE HUNTERS' FEAST, BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID.        CHAPTER ONE.    A HUNTING PARTY.    On the western bank of the Mississippi, twelve miles below the  _embouchure_ of the Missouri, stands the large town of Saint Louis,  poetically known as the \"Mound City.\"  Although there are many other  large towns throughout the Mississippi Valley, Saint Louis is the true  metropolis of the \"far west\"--of that semi-civilised, ever-changing belt  of territory known as the \"Frontier.\"    Saint Louis is one of those American cities in the history of which  there is something of peculiar interest.  It is one of the oldest of  North-American settlements, having been a French trading port at an  early period.    Though not so successful as their rivals the English, there was a degree  of picturesqueness about French colonisation, that, in the present day,  strongly claims the attention of the American poet, novelist, and  historian.  Their dealings with the Indian aborigines--the facile manner  in which they glided into the habits of the latter--meeting them more  than half-way between civilisation and savage life--the handsome  nomenclature which they have scattered freely, and which still holds  over the trans-Mississippian territories--the introduction of a new race  (the half blood--peculiarly French)--the heroic and adventurous  character of their earliest pioneers, De Salle Marquette, Father  Hennepin, etcetera--their romantic explorations and melancholy fate--all  these circumstances have rendered extremely interesting the early  history of the French in America.  Even the Quixotism of some of their  attempts at colonisation cannot fail to interest us, as at Gallipolis on  the Ohio, a colony composed of expatriated people of the French court;--  perruquiers, coachbuilders, tailors, _modistes_, and the like.  Here, in  the face of hostile Indians, before an acre of ground was cleared,  before the slightest provision was made for their future subsistence,  the first house erected was a large log structure, to serve as the  _salon du Lal_!    Besides its French origin, Saint Louis possesses many other points of  interest.  It has long been the _entrepot_ and _depot_ of commerce with  the wild tribes of prairie-land.  There the trader is supplied with his  stock for the Indian market--his red and green blanket--his beads and  trinkets--his rifles, and powder, and lead; and there, in return, he  disposes of the spoils of the prairie collected in many a far and  perilous wandering.  There the emigrant rests on the way to his  wilderness home; and the hunter equips himself before starting forth on  some new expedition.    To the traveller, Saint Louis is a place of peculiar interest.  He will  hear around him the language of every nation in the civilised world.  He  will behold faces of every hue and variety of expression.  He will meet  with men of every possible calling.    All this is peculiarly true in the latter part of the summer season.  Then the motley population of New Orleans fly from the annual scourge of  the yellow fever, and seek safety in the cities that lie farther north.  Of these, Saint Louis is a favourite \"city of refuge,\"--the Creole  element of its population being related to that kindred race in the  South, and keeping up with it this annual correspondence.    In one of these streams of migration I had found my way to Saint Louis,  in the autumn of 18--.  The place was at the time filled with loungers,  who seemed to have nothing else to do but kill time.  Every hotel had  its quota, and in every verandah and at the corners of the streets you  might see small knots of well-dressed gentlemen trying to entertain each  other, and laugh away the hours.  Most of them were the annual birds of  passage from New Orleans, who had fled from \"yellow Jack,\" and were  sojourning here till the cold frosty winds of November should drive that  intruder from the \"crescent city;\" but there were many other _flaneurs_  as well.  There were travellers from Europe:--men of wealth and rank who  had left behind them the luxuries of civilised society to rough it for a  season in the wild West--painters in search of the picturesque--  naturalists whose love of their favourite study had drawn them from  their comfortable closets to search for knowledge under circumstances of  extremest difficulty--and sportsmen, who, tired of chasing small game,  were on their way to the great plains to take part in the noble sport of  hunting the buffalo.  I was myself one of the last-named fraternity.    There is no country in the world so addicted to the _table d'hote_ as  America, and that very custom soon makes idle people acquainted with  each other.  I was not very long in the place before I was upon terms of  intimacy with a large number of these loungers, and I found several,  like myself, desirous of making a hunting expedition to the prairies.  This chimed in with my plans to a nicety, and I at once set about  getting up the expedition.  I found five others who were willing to join  me.    After several _conversaziones_, with much discussion, we succeeded at  length in \"fixing\" our plan.  Each was to \"equip\" according to his own  fancy, though it was necessary for each to provide himself with a riding  horse or mule.  After that, a general fund was to be \"raised,\" to be  appropriated to the purchase of a waggon and team, with tents, stores,  and cooking utensils.  A couple of professional hunters were to be  engaged; men who knew the ground to be traversed, and who were to act as  guides to the expedition.    About a week was consumed in making the necessary preparations, and at  the end of that time, under the sunrise of a lovely morning, a small  cavalcade was seen to issue from the back suburbs of Saint Louis, and,  climbing the undulating slopes in its rear, head for the far-stretching  wilderness of the prairies.  It was our hunting expedition.    The cavalcade consisted of eight mounted men, and a waggon with its full  team of six tough mules.  These last were under the _manege_ of \"Jake\"--  a free negro, with a shining black face, a thick full mop, and a set of  the best \"ivories,\" which were almost always uncovered in a smile.    Peeping from under the tilt of the waggon might be seen another face  strongly contrasting with that of Jake.  This had been originally of a  reddish hue, but sun-tan, and a thick sprinkling of freckles, had  changed the red to golden-yellow.  A shock of fiery hair surmounted this  visage, which was partially concealed under a badly-battered hat.  Though the face of the black expressed good-humour, it might have been  called sad when brought into comparison with that of the little red man,  which peeped out beside it.  Upon the latter, there was an expression  irresistibly comic--the expression of an actor in broad farce.  One eye  was continually on the wink, while the other looked knowing enough for  both.  A short clay-pipe, stuck jauntily between the lips, added to the  comical expression of the face, which was that of Mike Lanty from  Limerick.  No one ever mistook the nationality of Michael.    Who were the eight cavaliers that accompanied the waggon?  Six of them  were gentlemen by birth and education.  At least half that number were  scholars.  The other two laid no claim either to gentleness or  scholarship--they were rude trappers--the hunters and guides of the  expedition.    A word about each one of the eight, for there was not one of them  without his peculiarity.  First, there was an Englishman--a genuine type  of his countrymen--full six feet high, well proportioned, with broad  chest and shoulders, and massive limbs.  Hair of a light brown,  complexion florid, moustache and whiskers full and hay-coloured, but  suiting well the complexion and features.  The last were regular, and if  not handsome, at least good humoured and noble in their expression.  The  owner was in reality a nobleman--a true nobleman--one of that class who,  while travelling through the \"States,\" have the good sense to carry  their umbrella along, and leave their title behind them.  To us he was  known as Mr Thompson, and, after some time, when we had all become  familiar with each other, as plain \"Thompson.\"  It was only long after,  and by accident, that I became acquainted with his rank and title; some  of our companions do not know it to this day, but that is of no  consequence.  I mention the circumstance here to aid me in illustrating  the character of our travelling companion, who was \"close\" and modest  almost to a fault.    His costume was characteristic.  A \"tweed\" shooting jacket, of course,  with eight pockets--a vest of the same material with four--tweed  browsers, and a tweed cap.  In the waggon was _the hat-box_; of strong  yellow leather, with straps and padlock.  This"]]]
