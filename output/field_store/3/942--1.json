Stojowski_                 279          I    THE ARTIST'S LIFE    THE VIRTUOSO'S CAREER AS IT REALLY IS      The father of a young woman who was preparing to become a virtuoso once  applied to a famous musical educator for advice regarding the future  career of his daughter. \"I want her to become one of the greatest  pianists America has ever produced,\" he said. \"She has talent, good  health, unlimited ambition, a good general education, and she is  industrious.\" The educator thought for awhile, and then said, \"It is  very likely that your daughter will be successful in her chosen field,  but the amount of grinding study she will be obliged to undergo to meet  the towering standards of modern pianism is awful to contemplate. In the  end she will have the flattery of the multitude, and, let us hope, some  of their dollars as well. In return, she may have to sacrifice many of  the comforts and pleasures which women covet. The more successful she  is, the more of a nomad she must become. She will know but few days for  years when she will not be compelled to practice for hours. She becomes  a kind of chattel of the musical public. She will be harassed by  ignorant critics and perhaps annoyed by unreliable managers. In return  she has money and fame, but, in fact, far less of the great joy and  purpose of life than if she followed the customary domestic career with  some splendid man as her husband. When I was younger I used to preach  quite an opposite sermon, but the more I see of the hardships of the  artist's life the less I think of the dollars and the fame it brings. It  is hard enough for a man, but it is twice as hard for a woman.\"      GOLDEN BAIT    Some cynic has contended that the much-despised \"Almighty Dollar\" has  been the greatest incentive to the struggling virtuoso in European music  centers. Although this may be true in a number of cases, it is certainly  unjust in others. Many of the virtuosos find travel in America so  distasteful that notwithstanding the huge golden bait, the managers have  the greatest difficulty in inducing the pianists to come back. Indeed,  there are many artists of great renown whom the managers would be glad  to coax to our country but who have withheld tempting offers for years.  One of these is Moritz Moszkowski, probably the most popular of modern  pianoforte composers of high-class music. Grieg, when he finally  consented to make the voyage to America, placed his price at two  thousand five hundred dollars for every concert--a sum which any manager  would regard prohibitive, except in the case of one world-famous  pianist. Grieg's intent was obvious.    The inconveniences of travel in America have been ridiculously  exaggerated in Europe, and many virtuosos dread the thought of an  American trip, with the great ocean yawning between the two continents,  and red-skinned savages just beyond New York or certainly not far from  Chicago. De Pachmann detests the ocean, and when he comes over in his  favorite month of June he does not dare return until the following June.  Others who have never visited America must get their idea of American  travel from some such account as that of Charles Dickens in his  unforgivable _American Notes_ (1842), in which he said, in describing  one of our railroads:         \"There is a great deal of jolting, a great deal of noise, a       great deal of wall, not much window, a locomotive engine, a       shriek and a bell. The cars are like shabby omnibuses       holding thirty, forty, fifty people. In the centre of the       carriage there is usually a stove, fed with charcoal or       anthracite coal, which is for the most part red hot. It is       insufferably close, and you see the hot air fluttering       between yourself and any other object you may happen to look       at.\"    There could have been but little improvement in our railroads in 1872  when Rubinstein came to America, for although he accepted $40,000 for  215 concerts during his first trip, he refused an offer of $125,000 for  only 50 concerts when a manager tried to persuade him to return.    American railroads now present the acme of comfort, convenience, and  even luxury in travel, yet the European artist has difficulty in  adjusting himself to journeys of thousands of miles crowded in a short  winter season when he has been accustomed to little trips of a few  hundred kilometers. He comes to dread the trains as we might a prison  van. Paderewski resorts to a private car, but even this luxurious mode  of travel may be very monotonous and exhausting.    The great distances must certainly account for some of the evidences of  strain which deform the faces and exhaust the minds of so many  virtuosos. The traveling salesman seems to thrive upon miles of railroad  travel as do the crews of the trains, but the virtuoso, dragged from  concert to concert by his showman, grows tired--oh, so tired, pale, wan,  listless and indifferent! At the beginning of the season he is quite  another person. The magnetism that has done so much to win him fame  shines in his eyes and seems to emanate from his finger-tips, but the  difference in his physical being at the end of the season is sickening.  Like a bedraggled, worn-out circus coming in from the wear and tear of a  hard season, he crawls wearily back to New York with a cinematographic  recollection of countless telegraph poles flying past the windows,  audience after audience, sleeping cars, budding geniuses, the inevitable  receptions with their equally inevitable chicken salad or lukewarm  oysters, and the \"sweet young things,\" who, like Heine's mythical tribe  of _Asra_, must love or perish. Some virtuosos have the physical  strength to endure all this, even enjoy it, but many have confessed to  me that their American tours have been literal nightmares.    One of the greatest pianists was obliged to stay in New York for a while  before attempting the voyage homeward. At the time he was so weak from  the rigors of the tour that he could scarcely write his name. His  haggard face suggested the tortures of a Torquamada rather than Buffalo,  Kansas City, Denver and Pittsburgh. His voice was tired and faltering,  and his chief interest was that of the invalid--getting home as soon as  possible. To have talked with him upon music at that time would have  been an injustice. Accordingly, I led him away from the subject and  dwelt upon the woes of his native Poland, and, much to his surprise,  left him without the educational material of which I had been in quest.  He asked the reason, and I told him that a musical conference at that  time could serve no purpose.    As men and women, aside from the attainments which have made them  illustrious, virtuosos are for the most part very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Truly Yours Anna Dickinson\"]        ALL PERSONS BORN OR NATURALIZED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND SUBJECT TO         THE JURISDICTION THEREOF, ARE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES.                Susan B. Anthony,  17 Madison St., Rochester, N. Y.    Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1881, by  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, And  Matilda Joslyn Gage.  In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C.          PREFACE.      In presenting to our readers the second volume of the \"History of  Woman Suffrage,\" we gladly return our thanks to the press for the many  favorable notices we have received from leading journals, both in the  old world and the new. The words of cordial approval from a large  circle of friends, and especially from women well known in periodical  literature, have been to us a constant stimulus during the toilsome  months we have spent in gathering material for these pages. It was our  purpose to have condensed the records of the last twenty years in a  second volume, but so many new questions in regard to Citizenship,  State rights, and National power, indirectly bearing on the political  rights of women, grew out of the civil war, that the arguments and  decisions in Congress and the Supreme Courts have combined to swell  these pages beyond our most liberal calculations, with much valuable  material that can not be condensed nor ignored, making a third volume  inevitable.    By their active labors all through the great conflict, women learned  that they had many interests outside the home. In the camp and  hospital, and the vacant places at their firesides, they saw how  intimately the interests of the State and the home were intertwined;  that as war and all its concomitants were subjects of legislation, it  was only through a voice in the laws that their efforts for peace  could command consideration.    The political significance of the war, and the prolonged discussions  on the vital principles of government involved in the reconstruction,  threw new light on the status of woman in a republic. Under a liberal  interpretation of the XIV. Amendment, women, believing their rights of  citizenship secured, made several attempts to vote in different  States. Those who succeeded were arrested, tried, and convicted. Those  who were denied the right to register their names and deposit their  votes, sued the Inspectors of Election. Others attempting to practice  law, being denied that right in the States, took their cases up to the  Supreme Court of the United States for adjudication. Others invaded  the pulpit, asking to be ordained, which brought the question of  woman's right to preach before ecclesiastical assemblies. These  various attempts to secure her political and civil rights have called  forth endless discussions on woman's true position in the State, the  church, and the world of work.    While gratefully accepting the generous praises of our friends, we  must briefly reply to some strictures by our critics. Some object to  the title of our work; they say you can not write the \"History of  Woman Suffrage\" until the fact is accomplished. We feel that already  enough has been achieved to make the final victory certain. Women vote  in England, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, and  even India, on certain interests and qualifications; in Wyoming and  Utah on all questions, and on the same basis as male citizens; and in  a dozen States of the Union on school affairs. Moreover, women are  filling many offices, such as Clerks of Courts, Notaries Public,  Masters in Chancery, State Librarians, School Superintendents,  Commissioners of Charity, Post Mistresses, Pension Agents, Engrossing  and Enrolling Clerks in Legislative Assemblies.    After years of persistent effort a resolution was passed in both  Houses, during the present session of Congress (1882), securing \"a  select committee on the political Rights and Disabilities of  Woman\"--the first time in the history of our Government that a special  committee to look after the interests of woman was ever appointed. A  proposition for a XVI. Amendment to the National Constitution, to  secure to women the right of suffrage, is now pending in Congress.  Some phase of this question is being debated every year in State  Legislatures. Propositions for so amending their constitutions as to  extend the elective franchise to women will be voted upon by the  people in four of the Western States within the coming two years.  These successive steps of progress during forty years are as surely a  part of the History of Woman Suffrage as will be the events of the  closing period in which victory shall at last crown the hard fought  battles of half a century.
