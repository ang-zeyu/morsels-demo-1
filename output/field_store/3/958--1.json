WALTER MAUNDER, F.R.A.S.    AUTHOR OF  'THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH: ITS HISTORY AND WORK,'  AND 'ASTRONOMY WITHOUT A TELESCOPE'      _WITH THIRTY-FOUR ILLUSTRATIONS_      NEW YORK  MITCHELL KENNERLEY      RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED,  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C., AND  BUNGAY, SUFFOLK.      To    MY WIFE    My helper in this Book  and in all things.          PREFACE      Why should an astronomer write a commentary on the Bible?    Because commentators as a rule are not astronomers, and therefore either  pass over the astronomical allusions of Scripture in silence, or else  annotate them in a way which, from a scientific point of view, leaves  much to be desired.    Astronomical allusions in the Bible, direct and indirect, are not few in  number, and, in order to bring out their full significance, need to be  treated astronomically. Astronomy further gives us the power of placing  ourselves to some degree in the position of the patriarchs and prophets  of old. We know that the same sun and moon, stars and planets, shine  upon us as shone upon Abraham and Moses, David and Isaiah. We can, if we  will, see the unchanging heavens with their eyes, and understand their  attitude towards them.    It is worth while for us so to do. For the immense advances in science,  made since the Canon of Holy Scripture was closed, and especially during  the last three hundred years, may enable us to realize the significance  of a most remarkable fact. Even in those early ages, when to all the  nations surrounding Israel the heavenly bodies were objects for  divination or idolatry, the attitude of the sacred writers toward them  was perfect in its sanity and truth.    Astronomy has a yet further part to play in Biblical study. The dating  of the several books of the Bible, and the relation of certain heathen  mythologies to the Scripture narratives of the world's earliest ages,  have received much attention of late years. Literary analysis has thrown  much light on these subjects, but hitherto any evidence that astronomy  could give has been almost wholly neglected; although, from the nature  of the case, such evidence, so far as it is available, must be most  decisive and exact.    I have endeavoured, in the present book, to make an astronomical  commentary on the Bible, in a manner that shall be both clear and  interesting to the general reader, dispensing as far as possible with  astronomical technicalities, since the principles concerned are, for the  most part, quite simple. I trust, also, that I have taken the first step  in a new inquiry which promises to give results of no small importance.                                                   E.

This e-book was prepared        from a reprint of the 1876 edition, published by Thoemmes Press        and Kinokuniya Company Ltd. in 1997. Where the reprint was        unclear, the transcriber consulted a copy of the actual 1876        edition.          Footnotes             The original contains numerous footnotes, denoted by numbers           prior to Part I, and by symbols in the remainder of the book.           All of the footnotes are consecutively numbered in this           e-book; footnotes within footnotes are lettered.             Some of the footnotes contain lengthy book catalogues with           descriptions and prices. For ease of reading, in this e-book           these catalogues have been formatted as lists rather than           tables.

[Illustration]    ADVERTISEMENT.      _The public may not be altogether unprepared for the re-appearance of  the BIBLIOMANIA in a more attractive garb than heretofore;--and, in  consequence, more in uniformity with the previous publications of the  Author._    _More than thirty years have elapsed since the last edition; an  edition, which has become so scarce that there seemed to be no  reasonable objection why the possessors of the_ other _works of the  Author should be deprived of an opportunity of adding the_ present  _to the number: and although this re-impression may, on first glance,  appear something like a violation of contract with the public, yet,  when the length of time which has elapsed, and the smallness of the  price of the preceding impression, be considered, there does not  appear to be any very serious obstacle to the present republication;  the more so, as the number of copies is limited to five hundred._    _Another consideration deeply impressed itself upon the mind of the  Author. The course of thirty years has necessarily brought changes and  alterations amongst \"men and things.\" The dart of death has been so  busy during this period that, of the Bibliomaniacs so plentifully  recorded in the previous work, scarcely_ three,_--including the  Author--have survived. This has furnished a monitory theme for the  APPENDIX; which, to the friends both of the dead and the living,  cannot be perused without sympathising emotions--_         _\"A sigh the absent claim, the DEAD a tear.\"_    _The changes and alterations in \"things,\"--that is to say in the_  =Bibliomania= _itself--have been equally capricious and unaccountable:  our countrymen being, in_ these _days, to the full as fond of novelty  and variety as in those of Henry the Eighth. Dr. Board, who wrote his_  Introduction of Knowledge _in the year 1542, and dedicated it to the  Princess Mary, thus observes of our countrymen:_         _I am an Englishman, and naked do I stand here,       Musing in my mind what raiment I shall wear;       For now I will wear_ this, _and now I will wear_ that,       _Now I will wear--I cannot tell what._    _This highly curious and illustrative work was reprinted, with all its  wood-cut embellishments, by Mr. Upcott. A copy of the original and  most scarce edition is among the Selden books in the Bodleian library,  and in the Chetham Collection at Manchester. See the_ Typographical  Antiquities, _vol._ iii. _p._ 158-60.    _But I apprehend the general apathy of Bibliomaniacs to be in a great  measure attributable to the vast influx of BOOKS, of every  description, from the Continent--owing to the long continuance of  peace; and yet, in the appearance of what are called_ English  Rarities, _the market seems to be almost as barren as ever. The  wounds, inflicted in the HEBERIAN contest, have gradually healed, and  are subsiding into forgetfulness; excepting where, from_ collateral  _causes, there are too many_ striking _reasons to remember their  existence._    _Another motive may be humbly, yet confidently, assigned for the  re-appearance of this Work. It was thought, by its late  proprietor,--MR. EDWARD WALMSLEY[1]--to whose cost and liberality this  edition owes its appearance--to be a volume, in itself, of pleasant  and profitable perusal; composed perhaps in a quaint and original  style, but in accordance with the characters of the_ Dramatis Personae.  _Be this as it may, it is a work divested of all acrimonious  feeling--is applicable to all classes of society, to whom harmless  enthusiasm cannot be offensive--and is based upon a foundation not  likely to be speedily undermined._    _T.F. DIBDIN._    _May_ 1, 1842.         [Footnote 1: _Mr. EDWARD WALMSLEY, who died in 1841, at an       advanced age, had been long known to me. He had latterly       extensive calico-printing works at Mitcham, and devoted much       of his time to the production of beautiful patterns in that       fabrication; his taste, in almost every thing which he       undertook, leant towards the fine arts. His body was in the       counting-house; but his spirit was abroad, in the studio of       the painter or engraver. Had his natural talents, which were       strong and elastic, been cultivated in early life, he would,       in all probability, have attained a considerable reputation.       How he loved to embellish--almost to satiety--a favourite       work, may be seen by consulting a subsequent page towards       the end of this volume. He planned and published the_       Physiognomical Portraits, _a performance not divested of       interest--but failing in general success, from the prints       being, in many instances, a repetition of their precursors.       The thought, however, was a good one; and many of the heads       are powerfully executed. He took also a lively interest in       Mr. Major's splendid edition of Walpole's_ Anecdotes of       Painting in England, _a work, which can never want a reader       while taste has an abiding-place in one British bosom._         _Mr. Walmsley possessed a brave and generous spirit; and I       scarcely knew a man more disposed to bury the remembrance of       men's errors in that of their attainments and good       qualities._]          THE BIBLIOMANIA;    OR    =Book-Madness;=    CONTAINING SOME ACCOUNT OF THE    HISTORY, SYMPTOMS, AND CURE OF THIS FATAL DISEASE.
