It is simply paper coated with gelatino-bromide of  silver emulsion, similar to that which, when coated on glass or other  transparent support, forms the familiar dry-plate or film used in  negative-making. The emulsion used in making bromide paper, however, is  less rapid (less sensitive) than that used in the manufacture of plates or  films of ordinary rapidity; hence bromide paper may be manipulated with  more abundant light than would be safe with plates. It is used for making  prints by contact with a negative in the ordinary printing frame, and as  the simplest means for obtaining enlarged prints from small negatives.  Sometimes bromide paper is spoken of as a development paper, because the  picture-image does not print out during exposure, but requires to be  developed, as in negative-making. The preparation of the paper is beyond  the skill and equipment of the average photographer, but it may be readily  obtained from dealers in photographic supplies.    What are the practical advantages of bromide paper? In the first place, it  renders the photographer independent of daylight and weather as far as  making prints is concerned. It has excellent \"keeping\" qualities, _i.e._,  it does not spoil or deteriorate as readily as other printing papers, even  when stored without special care or precaution. Its manipulation is  extremely simple, and closely resembles the development of a negative. It  does not require a special sort of negative, but is adapted to give good  prints from negatives widely different in quality. It is obtainable in any  desired size, and with a great variety of surfaces, from extreme gloss to  that of rough drawing paper. It offers great latitude in exposure and  development, and yields, even in the hands of the novice, a greater  percentage of good prints than any other printing paper in the market. It  offers a range of tone from deepest black to the most delicate of  platinotype grays, which may be modified to give a fair variety of color  effects where this is desirable. It affords a simple means of making  enlargements without the necessity of an enlarged negative. It gives us a  ready means of producing many prints in a very short time, or, if desired,  we may make a proof or enlargement from the negative fresh from the  washing tray. And, finally, if we do our work faithfully and well, it will  give us permanent prints.    The bromide papers available in this country at present are confined to  those of the Eastman Kodak Company, the Defender Photo Supply Company and  J. L. Lewis, the last handling English papers only. Better papers could  not be desired. Broadly speaking, all bromide papers are made in a few  well-defined varieties; in considering the manipulation of the papers made  by a single firm, therefore, we practically cover all the papers in the  market. As a matter of convenience, then, we will glance over the  different varieties of bromide paper available, as represented by the  Eastman papers, with the understanding that what is said of any one  variety is generally applicable to papers of the same sort put out by  other manufacturers.    First we have the _Standard_ or ordinary bromide paper made for general  use. This comes in five different weights: _A_, a thin paper with smooth  surface, useful where detail is desirable; _B_, a heavier paper with  smooth surface, for large prints or for illustration purposes; and _C_, a  still heavier paper with a rough surface for broad effects and prints of  large size. _BB_, heavy smooth double weight; _CC_, heavy, rough, double  weight. Each of these varieties may be had in two grades, according to the  negative in hand or the effect desired in the print, viz.: _hard_, for use  with soft negatives where we desire to get vigor or contrast in the print,  and _soft_, for use with hard negatives where softness of effect is  desired in the print. For general use the _soft_ grade is preferable,  although it is advisable to have a supply of the _hard_ paper at hand as  useful in certain classes of work. The tones obtainable on the _Standard_  paper range to pure black, and are acceptable for ordinary purposes. For  pictorial work or special effects other papers are preferable.    _Platino-Bromide_ paper gives delicate platinotype tones, and where  negative, paper and manipulation are in harmony, the prints obtained on  this paper will be indistinguishable from good platinotypes in quality and  attractiveness. This paper comes in two weights, _Platino A_, a thin paper  suitable for small prints, and having a smooth surface useful for  detail-giving; and _Platino B_, a heavy paper with rough surface,  peculiarly suited for large contact prints or enlargements. Both varieties  are obtainable in _hard_ or _soft_ grades, characterized as above. _Matte  Enamel_, medium weight; _Enameled_, medium weight; _Velvet_, medium  weight.    _Royal Bromide_ is a capital paper in its proper place, _i.e._, for prints  not smaller than 8 x 10 inches, and then only when breadth of effect is  desired in the picture. It is a very heavy cream-colored paper, rough in  texture, and giving black tones by development, but designed to give sepia  or brown tones on a tinted ground by subsequent toning with a bath of hypo  and alum. This paper, also, may be had in two grades for _hard_ or _soft_  effects; it is further adapted for being printed on through silk or  bolting cloth, this modification adding to the effect of breadth  ordinarily given by the paper itself. I have seen prints on this paper  which were altogether pleasing, but subject and negative should be  carefully considered in its use. Rough Buff papers are very similar in  character. _Monox_ Bromide, made by the Defender Photo Supply Company, is  obtainable in six surfaces; No. 3, _Monox Rough_; No. 4, _Monox Gloss_;  No. 5, _Monox Matte_; No. 6, _Monox Lustre_; No. 7, _Monox Buff_, heavy  rough.    The Barnet bromide papers, comprising ten different varieties, differing  in weight and surface texture but very similar to the kinds already  described, are imported by J. L. Lewis, New York.    As a suggestion to the reader desiring to have at hand a stock of bromide  papers, I would advise _Platino A_, or a similar _soft_ paper for prints  under 5 x 7 inches; _Matte-Enamel_ for _soft_ effects, or a similar paper,  as an alternative; _Platino C_ and _Royal Bromide_ for _soft_ effects, or  similar papers, for prints 8 x 10 inches or larger, and for enlargements.  To these might be added a package of _Standard B_, and another of one of  the above varieties for _hard_ effects, to complete a supply for general  purposes. The beginner, however, will do well to avoid the indiscriminate  use of several varieties of paper, although he is advised to get  information of all the different varieties in the market. It is better to  select that variety which is best suited to the general character of one's  negatives and work, and to master that before changing to another. It is  true that an expert can get more good prints on bromide paper, from a  given number of bad negatives, than another expert can get with the same  negatives and any other printing paper; but it is also true that for the  best results on bromide paper the variety of paper used should be suitable  for the negative. It will be found, however, that this word \"suitable\"  covers, in bromide printing, a much wider range than is offered by many  printing papers. In fact there are only two sorts of negatives which will  not yield desirable prints on bromide paper: first, an exceedingly weak,  thin negative lacking in contrast and altogether flat; and second, a very  dense negative in which the contrasts are hopelessly emphatic. Even in  such cases, however, it may be possible to modify the negatives and so get  presentable prints.    The ideal negative for contact printing on bromide paper is one without  excessive contrasts on the one hand, and without excessive flatness on the  other. A moderately strong negative, such as will require from three to  five minutes in the sunlight with a print out paper, fairly describes it.  In other words, the negative should be fully exposed and so developed that  there is a fair amount of density in the shadows. I have never been able,  with bromide paper, to get the detail in the shadows of under-exposed  negatives, such as we see in a good print made on glossy printout paper.  For this reason the use of bromide papers with under-exposed negatives is  not advisable. But there are a great many negatives which, while  unsuitable as they come from the drying rack, can be easily adapted to the  process by slight modifications. A very dense negative, for instance, may  be reduced either with the ferricyanide of potash or persulphate of  ammonia reducer; and a thin negative with proper graduations can  frequently be intensified to advantage in the print. While, as has been  said, there is great latitude in the matter of the negative, this latitude  should only be availed of when necessary. Local reduction or  intensification of the negative is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24647"],[0,"The Standard Operaglass (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's note: the punctuation in this file is somewhat  inconsistent.
