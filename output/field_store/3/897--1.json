LADIES and GENTLEMEN,    Persons of Eminence, Rank, Quality, and a distinguishing Taste in any  particular Art or Science, are always in View of Authors who want a  Patron for that Art or Science, which they endeavour to recommend and  promote. No wonder therefore, I should have fix'd my Mind on You, to  patronize the following Treatise.    If there are Charms in Musick in general, all the reasonable World  agrees, that the _Vocal_ has the Pre-eminence, both from _Nature_ and  _Art_ above the Instrumental: From _Nature_ because without doubt it was  the first; from _Art_, because thereby the Voice may be brought to  express Sounds with greater Nicety and Exactness than Instruments.    The Charms of the human Voice, even in Speaking, are very powerful. It  is well known, that in _Oratory_ a just _Modulation_ of it is of the  highest Consequence. The Care Antiquity took to bring it to Perfection,  is a sufficient Demonstration of the Opinion they had of its Power; and  every body, who has a discerning Faculty, may have experienced that  sometimes a Discourse, by the Power of the _Orator's_ Voice, has made an  Impression, which was lost in the Reading.    But, above all, the soft and pleasing Voice of the _fair Sex_ has  irresistible Charms and adds considerably to their Beauty.    If the Voice then has such singular Prerogatives, one must naturally  wish its Perfection in musical Performances, and be inclined to forward  any thing that may be conducive to that end. This is the reason why I  have been more easily prevail'd upon to engage in this Work, in order to  make a famous _Italian Master_, who treats so well on this Subject,  familiar to _England_; and why I presume to offer it to your Protection.    The Part, I bear in it, is not enough to claim any Merit; but my  endeavouring to offer to your Perusal what may be entertaining, and of  Service, intitles me humbly to recommend myself to your Favour: Who am,      LADIES _and_ GENTLEMEN,      _Your most devoted,        And most obedient          Humble Servant_,              J. E. GALLIARD.          [Illustration]    A    Prefatory Discourse    GIVING    _Some Account of the_ AUTHOR.      _Pier._ _Francesco Tosi_, the Author of the following Treatise, was an  _Italian_, and a Singer of great Esteem and Reputation. He spent the  most part of his Life in travelling, and by that Means heard the most  eminent Singers in _Europe_, from whence, by the Help of his nice  Taste, he made the following Observations. Among his many Excursions,  his Curiosity was raised to visit _England_, where he resided for some  time in the Reigns of King _James_ the Second, King _William_, King  _George_ the First, and the Beginning of his present Majesty's: He dy'd  soon after, having lived to above Fourscore. He had a great deal of Wit  and Vivacity, which he retained to his latter Days. His manner of  Singing was full of Expression and Passion; chiefly in the Stile of  Chamber-Musick. The best Performers in his Time thought themselves happy  when they could have an Opportunity to hear him. After he had lost his  Voice, he apply'd himself more particularly to Composition; of which he  has given Proof in his _Cantata's_, which are of an exquisite Taste,  especially in the _Recitatives_, where he excels in the _Pathetick_ and  _Expression_ beyond any other. He was a zealous Well-wisher to all who  distinguished themselves in Musick; but rigorous to those who abused and  degraded the Profession. He was very much esteemed by Persons of Rank  among whom the late Earl of _Peterborough_ was one, having often met him  in his Travels beyond Sea; and he was well received by his Lordship  when in _England_, to Whom he dedicated this Treatise. This alone would  be a sufficient Indication of his Merit, his being taken Notice of by a  Person of that Quality, and distinguishing Taste. The Emperor _Joseph_  gave him an honourable Employment _Arch-Duchess_ a Church-Retirement in  some part of _Italy_, and the late _Flanders_, where he died. As for his  _Observations_ and _Sentiments_ on Singing, they must speak for  themselves; and the Translation of them, it is hoped, will be acceptable  to Lovers of Musick, because this particular Branch has never been  treated of in so distinct and ample a Manner by any other Author.  Besides, it has been thought by Persons of Judgment, that it would be of  Service to make the Sentiments of our Author more universally known,  when a false Taste in Musick is so prevailing; and, that these Censures,  as they are passed by an _Italian_ upon his own Countrymen, cannot but  be looked upon as impartial. It is incontestable, that the Neglect of  true Study, the sacrificing the Beauty of the Voice to a Number of  ill-regulated Volubilities, the neglecting the Pronunciation and  Expression of the Words, besides many other Things taken Notice of in  this Treatise, are all _bad_. The Studious will find, that our Author's  Remarks will be of Advantage, not only to Vocal Performers, but likewise  to the Instrumental, where Taste and a Manner are required; and shew,  that a little less _Fiddling_ with the _Voice_, and a little more  _Singing_ with the _Instrument_, would be of great Service to Both.  Whosoever reads this Treatise with Application, cannot fail of  Improvement by it. It is hoped, that the Translation will be indulged,  if, notwithstanding all possible Care, it should be defective in the  Purity of the _English_ Language! it being almost impossible  (considering the Stile of our Author, which is a little more figurative  than the present Taste of the _English_ allows in their Writings,) not  to retain something of the Idiom of the Original; but where the Sense of  the Matter is made plain, the Stile may not be thought so material, in  Writings of this Kind.      THE    AUTHOR'S Dedication    TO HIS    Excellency the Earl of  PETERBOROUGH, General  of the Marines  of _Great-Britain_.      MY LORD,    I Should be afraid of leaving the World under the Imputation of  Ingratitude, should I any longer defer publishing the very many  Favours, which _Your Lordship_ so generously has bestow'd on me in  _Italy_, in _Germany_, in _Flanders_, in _England_; and principally at  your delightful Seat at _Parson's-Green_, where _Your Lordship_ having  been pleased to do me the Honour of imparting to me your Thoughts with  Freedom, I have often had the Opportunity of admiring your extensive  Knowledge, which almost made me overlook the Beauty and Elegance of the  Place. The famous _Tulip-Tree_, in your Garden there is not so  surprising a Rarity, as the uncommon Penetration of your Judgment, which  has sometimes (I may say) foretold Events, which have afterwards come  to pass. But what Return can I make for so great Obligations, when the  mentioning of them is doing myself an Honour, and the very  Acknowledgment has the Appearance of _Vanity_? It is better therefore to  treasure them up in my Heart, and remain respectfully silent; only  making an humble Request to _Your Lordship_ that you will condescend  favourably to accept this mean Offering of my OBSERVATIONS; which I am  induc'd to make, from the common Duty which lies upon every Professor to  preserve Musick in its Perfection; and upon Me in particular, for having  been the first, or among the first, of those who discovered the noble  Genius of your potent and generous Nation for it. However, I should not  have presum'd to dedicate them to a Hero adorn'd with such glorious  Actions, if _Singing_ was not a Delight of the Soul, or if any one had a  Soul more sensible of its Charms. On which account, I think, I have a  just Pretence to declare myself, with profound Obsequiousness,      YOUR LORDSHIP'S      _Most humble_,        _Most devoted and_          _Most oblig'd Servant_,            Pier.

The Opinions of the ancient Historians, on the Origin of Musick, are  various. _Pliny_ believes that _Amphion_ was the Inventor of it; the  _Grecians_ maintain, that it was _Dionysius_; _Polybius_ ascribes it to  the _Arcadians_; _Suidas_ and _Boetius_ give the Glory entirely to  _Pythagoras_; asserting, that from the Sound of three Hammers of  different Weights at a Smith's Forge, he found out the Diatonick; after  which _Timotheus_, the _Milesian_, added the Chromatick, and  _Olympicus_, or _Olympus_, the Enharmonick Scale.

CAPTAINS OF THE CIVIL WAR    CHAPTER I    THE CLASH: 1861    States which claimed a sovereign right to secede from the Union  naturally claimed the corresponding right to resume possession of  all the land they had ceded to that Union's Government for the use  of its naval and military posts. So South Carolina, after leading  the way to secession on December 20, 1860, at once began to work  for the retrocession of the forts defending her famous cotton port  of Charleston. These defenses, being of vital consequence to both  sides, were soon to attract the strained attention of the whole  country.    There were three minor forts: Castle Pinckney, dozing away, in  charge of a solitary sergeant, on an island less than a mile from  the city; Fort Moultrie, feebly garrisoned and completely at the  mercy of attackers on its landward side; and Fort Johnson over on  James Island. Lastly, there was the world-renowned Fort Sumter,  which then stood, unfinished and ungarrisoned, on a little islet  beside the main ship channel, at the entrance to the harbor, and  facing Fort Moultrie just a mile away. The proper war garrison of  all the forts should have been over a thousand men. The actual  garrison--including officers, band, and the Castle Pinckney  sergeant--was less than a hundred. It was, however, loyal to the  Union; and its commandant, Major Robert Anderson, though born in  the slave-owning State of Kentucky, was determined to fight.    The situation, here as elsewhere, was complicated by Floyd, President  Buchanan's Secretary of War, soon to be forced out of office on a  charge of misapplying public funds. Floyd, as an ardent Southerner,  was using the last lax days of the Buchanan Government to get the  army posts ready for capitulation whenever secession should have  become an accomplished fact. He urged on construction, repairs, and  armament at Charleston, while refusing to strengthen the garrison,  in order, as he said, not to provoke Carolina. Moreover, in November  he had replaced old Colonel Gardner, a Northern veteran of \"1812,\" by  Anderson the Southerner, in whom he hoped to find a good capitulator.  But this time Floyd was wrong.    The day after Christmas Anderson's little garrison at Fort Moultrie  slipped over to Fort Sumter under cover of the dark, quietly removed  Floyd's workmen, who were mostly Baltimore Secessionists, and began  to prepare for defense. Next morning Charleston was furious and  began to prepare for attack. The South Carolina authorities at  once took formal possession of Pinckney and Moultrie; and three  days later seized the United States Arsenal in Charleston itself.  Ten days later again, on January 9, 1861, the _Star of the West_,  a merchant vessel coming in with reinforcements and supplies for  Anderson, was fired on and forced to turn back. Anderson, who had  expected a man-of-war, would not fire in her defense, partly because  he still hoped there might yet be peace.    While Charleston stood at gaze and Anderson at bay the ferment of  secession was working fast in Florida, where another tiny garrison  was all the Union had to hold its own. This garrison, under two  loyal young lieutenants, Slemmer and Gilman, occupied Barrancas  Barracks in Pensacola Bay. Late at night on the eighth of January  (the day before the _Star of the West_ was fired on at Charleston)  some twenty Secessionists came to seize the old Spanish Fort San  Carlos, where, up to that time, the powder had been kept. This  fort, though lying close beside the barracks, had always been  unoccupied; so the Secessionists looked forward to an easy capture.  But, to their dismay, an unexpected guard challenged them, and,  not getting the proper password in reply, dispersed them with the  first shots of the Civil War.    Commodore Armstrong sat idle at the Pensacola Navy Yard, distracted  between the Union and secession. On the ninth Slemmer received  orders from Winfield Scott, General-in-Chief at Washington, to  use all means in defense of Union property. Next morning Slemmer  and his fifty faithful men were landed on Santa Rosa Island, just  one mile across the bay, where the dilapidated old Fort Pickens  stood forlorn. Two days later the Commodore surrendered the Navy  Yard, the Stars and Stripes were lowered, and everything ashore fell  into the enemy's hands. There was no flagstaff at Fort Pickens; but  the Union colors were at once hung out over the northwest bastion,  in full view of the shore, while the _Supply_ and _Wyandotte_,  the only naval vessels in the bay, and both commanded by loyal  men, mastheaded extra colors and stood clear. Five days afterwards  they had to sail for New York; and Slemmer, whose total garrison  had been raised to eighty by the addition of thirty sailors, was  left to hold Fort Pickens if he could.    He had already been summoned to surrender by Colonel Chase and  Captain Farrand, who had left the United States Army and Navy for  the service of the South. Chase, like many another Southern officer,  was stirred to his inmost depths by his own change of allegiance.  \"I have come,\" he said, \"to ask of you young officers, officers of  the same army in which I have spent the best and happiest years  of my life, the surrender of this fort; and fearing that I might  not be able to say it as I ought, and also to have it in proper  form, I have put it in writing and will read it.\" He then began  to read. But his eyes filled with tears, and, stamping his foot,  he said: \"I can't read it. Here, Farrand, you read it.\" Farrand,  however, pleading that his eyes were weak, handed the paper to the  younger Union officer, saying, \"Here, Gilman, you have good eyes,  please read it.\" Slemmer refused to surrender and held out till  reinforced in April, by which time the war had begun in earnest.  Fort Pickens was never taken. On the contrary, it supported the  bombardment of the Confederate 'longshore positions the next New  Year (1862) and witnessed the burning and evacuation of Pensacola  the following ninth of May.    While Charleston and Pensacola were fanning the flames of secession  the wildfire was running round the Gulf, catching well throughout  Louisiana, where the Governor ordered the state militia to seize  every place belonging to the Union, and striking inland till it  reached the farthest army posts in Texas. In all Louisiana the  Union Government had only forty men. These occupied the Arsenal at  Baton Rouge under Major Haskins. Haskins was loyal. But when five  hundred state militiamen surrounded him, and his old brother-officer,  the future Confederate General Bragg, persuaded him that the Union  was really at an end, to all intents and purposes, and when he  found no orders, no support, and not even any guidance from the  Government at Washington, he surrendered with the honors of war  and left by boat for St. Louis in Missouri.    There was then in Louisiana another Union officer; but made of  sterner stuff. This was Colonel W. T. Sherman, Superintendent of  the State Seminary"]]]
