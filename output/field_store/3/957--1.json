CHAPTER 11.                  PREFACE    1. 1 Whereas the war which the Jews made with the Romans hath been the  greatest of all those, not only that have been in our times, but, in a  manner, of those that ever were heard of; both of those wherein cities  have fought against cities, or nations against nations; while some men  who were not concerned in the affairs themselves have gotten together  vain and contradictory stories by hearsay, and have written them down  after a sophistical manner; and while those that were there present  have given false accounts of things, and this either out of a humor of  flattery to the Romans, or of hatred towards the Jews; and while their  writings contain sometimes accusations, and sometimes encomiums, but no  where the accurate truth of the facts; I have proposed to myself,  for the sake of such as live under the government of the Romans, to  translate those books into the Greek tongue, which I formerly composed  in the language of our country, and sent to the Upper Barbarians; 2  Joseph, the son of Matthias, by birth a Hebrew, a priest also, and one  who at first fought against the Romans myself, and was forced to be  present at what was done afterwards, [am the author of this work].    2. Now at the time when this great concussion of affairs happened, the  affairs of the Romans were themselves in great disorder. Those Jews also  who were for innovations, then arose when the times were disturbed; they  were also in a flourishing condition for strength and riches, insomuch  that the affairs of the East were then exceeding tumultuous, while some  hoped for gain, and others were afraid of loss in such troubles; for the  Jews hoped that all of their nation which were beyond Euphrates would  have raised an insurrection together with them. The Gauls also, in the  neighborhood of the Romans, were in motion, and the Geltin were  not quiet; but all was in disorder after the death of Nero. And the  opportunity now offered induced many to aim at the royal power; and the  soldiery affected change, out of the hopes of getting money. I thought  it therefore an absurd thing to see the truth falsified in affairs of  such great consequence, and to take no notice of it; but to suffer those  Greeks and Romans that were not in the wars to be ignorant of these  things, and to read either flatteries or fictions, while the Parthians,  and the Babylonians, and the remotest Arabians, and those of our nation  beyond Euphrates, with the Adiabeni, by my means, knew accurately both  whence the war begun, what miseries it brought upon us, and after what  manner it ended.    3. It is true, these writers have the confidence to call their accounts  histories; wherein yet they seem to me to fail of their own purpose,  as well as to relate nothing that is sound. For they have a mind to  demonstrate the greatness of the Romans, while they still diminish and  lessen the actions of the Jews, as not discerning how it cannot be that  those must appear to be great who have only conquered those that were  little. Nor are they ashamed to overlook the length of the war, the  multitude of the Roman forces who so greatly suffered in it, or the  might of the commanders, whose great labors about Jerusalem will be  deemed inglorious, if what they achieved be reckoned but a small matter.    4. However, I will not go to the other extreme, out of opposition to  those men who extol the Romans nor will I determine to raise the actions  of my countrymen too high; but I will prosecute the actions of both  parties with accuracy. Yet shall I suit my language to the passions I am  under, as to the affairs I describe, and must be allowed to indulge some  lamentations upon the miseries undergone by my own country. For that it  was a seditious temper of our own that destroyed it, and that they were  the tyrants among the Jews who brought the Roman power upon us, who  unwillingly attacked us, and occasioned the burning of our holy temple,  Titus Caesar, who destroyed it, is himself a witness, who, during the  entire war, pitied the people who were kept under by the seditious, and  did often voluntarily delay the taking of the city, and allowed time to  the siege, in order to let the authors have opportunity for repentance.  But if any one makes an unjust accusation against us, when we speak so  passionately about the tyrants, or the robbers, or sorely bewail the  misfortunes of our country, let him indulge my affections herein, though  it be contrary to the rules for writing history; because it had so  come to pass, that our city Jerusalem had arrived at a higher degree of  felicity than any other city under the Roman government, and yet at last  fell into the sorest of calamities again. Accordingly, it appears to  me that the misfortunes of all men, from the beginning of the world, if  they be compared to these of the Jews 3 are not so considerable as they  were; while the authors of them were not foreigners neither. This makes  it impossible for me to contain my lamentations. But if any one be  inflexible in his censures of me, let him attribute the facts themselves  to the historical part, and the lamentations to the writer himself only.    5. However, I may justly blame the learned men among the Greeks, who,  when such great actions have been done in their own times, which, upon  the comparison, quite eclipse the old wars, do yet sit as judges of  those affairs, and pass bitter censures upon the labors of the best  writers of antiquity; which moderns, although they may be superior  to the old writers in eloquence, yet are they inferior to them in  the execution of what they intended to do. While these also write new  histories about the Assyrians and Medes, as if the ancient writers had  not described their affairs as they ought to have done; although these  be as far inferior to them in abilities as they are different in their  notions from them. For of old every one took upon them to write what  happened in his own time; where their immediate concern in the actions  made their promises of value; and where it must be reproachful to write  lies, when they must be known by the readers to be such. But then,  an undertaking to preserve the memory Of what hath not been before  recorded, and to represent the affairs of one's own time to those that  come afterwards, is really worthy of praise and commendation. Now he is  to be esteemed to have taken good pains in earnest, not who does no more  than change the disposition and order of other men's works, but he  who not only relates what had not been related before, but composes an  entire body of history of his own: accordingly, I have been at great  charges, and have taken very great pains [about this history], though  I be a foreigner; and do dedicate this work, as a memorial of great  actions, both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians. But for some of our  own principal men, their mouths are wide open, and their tongues loosed  presently, for gain and law-suits, but quite muzzled up when they are  to write history, where they must speak truth and gather facts together  with a great deal of pains; and so they leave the writing such histories  to weaker people, and to such as are not acquainted with the actions of  princes. Yet shall the real truth of historical facts be preferred by  us, how much soever it be neglected among the Greek historians.    6. To write concerning the Antiquities of the Jews, who they were  [originally], and how they revolted from the Egyptians, and what country  they traveled over, and what countries they seized upon afterward,  and how they were removed out of them, I think this not to be a fit  opportunity, and, on other accounts, also superfluous; and this because  many Jews before me have composed the histories of our ancestors very  exactly; as have some of the Greeks done it also, and have translated  our histories into their own tongue, and have not much mistaken the  truth in their histories. But then, where the writers of these affairs  and our prophets "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#1)"],[1,"VADIS    A NARRATIVE OF THE TIME OF NERO    by Henryk Sienkiewicz      Translated from the Polish by Jeremiah Curtin             TO AUGUSTE COMTE,         Of San Francisco, Cal.,         MY DEAR FRIEND AND CLASSMATE, I BEG TO DEDICATE THIS VOLUME.         JEREMIAH CURTIN          INTRODUCTORY    IN the trilogy \"With Fire and Sword,\" \"The Deluge,\" and \"Pan Michael,\"  Sienkiewicz has given pictures of a great and decisive epoch in modern  history. The results of the struggle begun under Bogdan Hmelnitski have  been felt for more than two centuries, and they are growing daily in  importance. The Russia which rose out of that struggle has become a  power not only of European but of world-wide significance, and, to all  human seeming, she is yet in an early stage of her career.    In \"Quo Vadis\" the author gives us pictures of opening scenes in the  conflict of moral ideas with the Roman Empire,--a conflict from which  Christianity issued as the leading force in history.    The Slays are not so well known to Western Europe or to us as they  are sure to be in the near future; hence the trilogy, with all its  popularity and merit, is not appreciated yet as it will be.    The conflict described in \"Quo Vadis\" is of supreme interest to a vast  number of persons reading English; and this book will rouse, I think,  more attention at first than anything written by Sienkiewicz hitherto.    JEREMIAH CURTIN    ILOM, NORTHERN GUATEMALA,    June, 1896            QUO VADIS    Quo Vadis A Narrative of the Time of Nero          Chapter I      PETRONIUS woke only about midday, and as usual greatly wearied. The  evening before he had been at one of Nero's feasts, which was prolonged  till late at night. For some time his health had been failing. He said  himself that he woke up benumbed, as it were, and without power of  collecting his thoughts. But the morning bath and careful kneading of  the body by trained slaves hastened gradually the course of his slothful  blood, roused him, quickened him, restored his strength, so that he  issued from the elaeothesium, that is, the last division of the bath, as  if he had risen from the dead, with eyes gleaming from wit and gladness,  rejuvenated, filled with life, exquisite, so unapproachable that Otho  himself could not compare with him, and was really that which he had  been called,--arbiter elegantiarum.    He visited the public baths rarely, only when some rhetor happened there  who roused admiration and who was spoken of in the city, or when in the  ephebias there were combats of exceptional interest. Moreover, he had in  his own \"insula\" private baths which Celer, the famous contemporary  of Severus, had extended for him, reconstructed and arranged with such  uncommon taste that Nero himself acknowledged their excellence over  those of the Emperor, though the imperial baths were more extensive and  finished with incomparably greater luxury.    After that feast, at which he was bored by the jesting of Vatinius with  Nero, Lucan, and Seneca, he took part in a diatribe as to whether woman  has a soul. Rising late, he used, as was his custom, the baths. Two  enormous balneatores laid him on a cypress table covered with snow-white  Egyptian byssus, and with hands dipped in perfumed olive oil began to  rub his shapely body; and he waited with closed eyes till the heat  of the laconicum and the heat of their hands passed through him and  expelled weariness.    But after a certain time he spoke, and opened his eyes; he inquired  about the weather, and then about gems which the jeweller Idomeneus  had promised to send him for examination that day. It appeared that the  weather was beautiful, with a light breeze from the Alban hills, and  that the gems had not been brought. Petronius closed his eyes again, and  had given command to bear him to the tepidarium, when from behind  the curtain the nomenclator looked in, announcing that young Marcus  Vinicius, recently returned from Asia Minor, had come to visit him.    Petronius ordered to admit the guest to the tepidarium, to which he  was borne himself. Vinicius was the son of his oldest sister, who years  before had married Marcus Vinicius, a man of consular dignity from the  time of Tiberius. The young man was serving then under Corbulo against  the Parthians, and at the close of the war had returned to the city.  Petronius had for him a certain weakness bordering on attachment, for  Marcus was beautiful and athletic, a young man who knew how to preserve  a certain aesthetic measure in his profligacy; this, Petronius prized  above everything.    \"A greeting to Petronius,\" said the young man, entering the tepidarium  with a springy step. \"May all the gods grant thee success, but  especially Asklepios and Kypris, for under their double protection  nothing evil can meet one.\"    \"I greet thee in Rome, and may thy rest be sweet after war,\" replied  Petronius, extending his hand from between the folds of soft karbas  stuff in which he was wrapped. \"What's to be heard in Armenia; or since  thou wert in Asia, didst thou not stumble into Bithynia?\"    Petronius on a time had been proconsul in Bithynia, and, what is more,  he had governed with energy and justice. This was a marvellous contrast  in the character of a man noted for effeminacy and love of luxury; hence  he was fond of mentioning those times, as they were a proof of what he  had been, and of what he might have become had it pleased him.    \"I happened to visit Heraklea,\" answered Vinicius. \"Corbulo sent me  there with an order to assemble reinforcements.\"    \"Ah, Heraklea! I knew at Heraklea a certain maiden from Colchis,  for whom I would have given all the divorced women of this city, not  excluding Poppaea. But these are old stories. Tell me now, rather, what  is to be heard from the Parthian boundary. It is true that they weary me  every Vologeses of them, and Tiridates and Tigranes,--those barbarians  who, as young Arulenus insists, walk on all fours at home, and pretend  to be human only when in our presence. But now people in Rome speak much  of them, if only for the reason that it is dangerous to speak of aught  else.\"    \"The war is going badly, and but for Corbulo might be turned to defeat.\"    \"Corbulo! by Bacchus! a real god of war, a genuine Mars, a great leader,  at the same time quick-tempered, honest, and dull. I love him, even for  this,--that Nero is afraid of him.\"    \"Corbulo is not a dull man.\"    \"Perhaps thou art right, but for that matter it is all one. Dulness,  as Pyrrho says, is in no way worse than wisdom, and differs from it in  nothing.\"    Vinicius began to talk of the war; but when Petronius closed his eyes  again, the young man, seeing his uncle's tired and somewhat emaciated  face, changed the conversation, and inquired with a certain interest  about his health.    Petronius opened his eyes again.    Health!--No. He did not feel well. He had not gone so far yet, it is  true, as young Sissena, who had lost sensation to such a degree that  when he was brought to the bath in the morning he inquired, \"Am I  sitting?\" But he was not well. Vinicius had just committed him to the  care of Asklepios and Kypris. But he, Petronius, did not believe in  Asklepios. It was not known even whose son that Asklepios was, the son  of Arsinoe or Koronis; and if the mother was doubtful, what was to be  said of the father? Who, in that time, could be sure who his own father  was?    Hereupon Petronius began to laugh; then he continued,--\"Two years ago,  it is true, I sent to Epidaurus three dozen live blackbirds and a goblet  of gold; but dost thou know why? I said to myself, 'Whether this helps  or not, it will do me no harm.' Though people make offerings to the  gods yet, I believe that all think as I do,--all, with the exception,  perhaps, of mule-drivers hired at the Porta Capena by travellers.  Besides Asklepios, I have had dealings with sons of Asklepios. When  I was troubled a little last year in the bladder, they performed an  incubation for me. I saw that they were tricksters, but I said to  myself: 'What harm! The world stands on deceit, and life is an illusion.  The soul is an illusion too. But one must have reason enough to  distinguish pleasant from painful illusions.' I shall give command to  burn in my hypocaustum, cedar-wood sprinkled with ambergris, for during  life I prefer perfumes to stenches. As to Kypris, to whom thou hast also  confided me, I have known her guardianship to the extent that I have  twinges in my right foot. But as to the rest she is a good goddess! I  suppose that thou wilt bear sooner or later white doves to her altar.\"    \"True,\" answered Vinicius. \"The arrows of the Parthians have not reached  my body, but a dart of Amor has struck me--unexpectedly, a few stadia  from a gate of this city.\"    \"By the white knees of the Graces! thou wilt tell me of this at a  leisure hour.\"    \"I have come purposely to get thy advice,\" answered Marcus.    But at that moment the epilatores came, and occupied themselves with  Petronius. Marcus, throwing aside his tunic, entered a bath of tepid  water, for Petronius invited him to a plunge bath.    \"Ah, I have not even asked whether thy feeling is reciprocated,\" said  Petronius, looking at the youthful body of Marcus, which was as if cut  out of marble. \"Had Lysippos seen thee, thou wouldst be ornamenting now  the gate leading to the Palatine, as a statue of Hercules in youth.\"    The young man smiled with satisfaction, and began to sink in the bath,  splashing warm water abundantly on the mosaic which represented Hera at  the moment when she was imploring Sleep to lull Zeus to rest. Petronius  looked at him with the satisfied eye of an artist.    When Vinicius had finished and yielded himself in turn to the  epilatores, a lector came in with a bronze tube at his breast and rolls  of paper in the tube.    \"Dost wish to listen?\" asked Petronius.    \"If it is thy creation, gladly!\" answered the young"]]]
