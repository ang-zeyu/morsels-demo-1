The first book, called \"On the Witness Stand,\"  studied the relations of scientific psychology to crime and the law  courts. This new book deals with the relations of psychology to  medicine. Others discussing its relations to education, to social  problems, to commerce and industry will follow soon.    For popular treatment I divide applied psychology into such various,  separated books because they naturally address very different audiences.  That which interests the lawyer does not concern the physician, and  again the school-teacher has his own sphere of interests. Moreover the  different subjects demand a different treatment. The problems of  psychology and law were almost entirely neglected. I was anxious to draw  wide attention to this promising field and therefore I chose the form of  loose popular essays without any aim towards systematic presentation of  the subject. As to psychology and medicine almost the opposite situation  prevails. There is perhaps too much talk afloat about psychotherapy, the  widest circles cultivate the discussion, the magazines overflow with  it. The duty of the scientific psychologist is accordingly not to stir  up interest in this topic but to help in bringing this interest from  mere gossip, vague mysticism, and medical amateurishness to a clear  understanding of principles. What is needed in this time of faith cures  of a hundred types is to deal with the whole circle of problems in a  serious, systematic way and to emphasize the aspect of scientific  psychological theory.    Hence the whole first part of this book is an abstract discussion and  its first chapters have not even any direct relation to disease. I am  convinced that both physicians and ministers and all who are in  practical contact with these important questions ought to be brought to  such painstaking and perhaps fatiguing inquiry into principles before  the facts are reached. To those who seek a discussion of life facts  alone, the whole first part will of course appear to be a tedious way  around; they may turn directly to the second and third parts.    One word for my personal right to deal with these questions, as too much  illegitimate psychotherapeutics is heard to-day. For me, the relation  between psychology and medicine is not a chance chapter of my science to  which I have turned simply in following up the various sides of applied  psychology. And still less have I turned to it because it has become the  fashion in recent years. On the contrary, it has been an important  factor in all my work since my student days. I have been through five  years of regular medical studies, three years in Leipzig and two years  in Heidelberg; I have an M.D. degree from the University of Heidelberg.  In my first year as docent in a German university twenty years ago, I  gave throughout the winter semester before several hundred students a  course in hypnotism and its medical application. It was probably the  first university course on hypnotism given anywhere. Since that time I  have never ceased to work psychotherapeutically in the psychological  laboratory. Yet that must not be misunderstood. I have no clinic, and  while by principle I have never hypnotized anyone for mere experiment's  sake but always only for medical purposes, yet I adjust my practical  work entirely to the interests of my scientific study. The limitations  of my time force me to refuse the psychotherapeutic treatment of any  case which has not a certain scientific interest for me, and of the many  hundreds whom I have helped in the laboratory, no one ever had to pay  anything. Thus my practical work has strictly the character of  laboratory research.    The chief aim of this book is twofold. It is a negative one: I want to  counteract the misunderstandings which overflood the whole field,  especially by the careless mixing of mental and moral influence. And a  positive one: I want to strengthen the public feeling that the time has  come when every physician should systematically study psychology, the  normal in the college years and the abnormal in the medical school. This  demand of medical education cannot be postponed any longer. The aim of  the book is not to fight the Emmanuel Church Movement, or even  Christian Science or any other psychotherapeutic tendency outside of the  field of scientific medicine. I see the element of truth in all of them,  but they ought to be symptoms of transition. Scientific medicine should  take hold of psychotherapeutics now or a most deplorable disorganization  will set in, the symptoms of which no one ought to overlook to-day.

It stands at the side of physicotherapy, which attempts to  cure the sick by influencing the body, perhaps with drugs and medicines,  or with electricity or baths or diet.    Psychotherapy is sharply to be separated from psychiatry, the treatment  of mental diseases. Of course to a certain degree, mental illness too,  is open to mental treatment; but certainly many diseases of the mind lie  entirely beyond the reach of psychotherapy, and on the other hand  psychotherapy may be applied also to diseases which are not mental at  all. That which binds all psychotherapeutic efforts together into unity  is the method of treatment. The psychotherapist must always somehow set  levers of the mind in motion and work through them towards the removal  of the sufferer's ailment; but the disturbances to be treated may show  the greatest possible variety and may belong to mind or body.    Treatment of diseases by influence on the mind is as old as human  history, but it has attained at various times very different degrees of  importance. There is no lack of evidence that we have entered into a  period in which an especial emphasis will be laid on the too long  neglected psychical factor. This new movement is probably only in its  beginning and the loudness with which it presents itself to-day is one  of the many indications of its immaturity. Whether it will be a blessing  or a danger, whether it will really lead forward in a lasting way, or  whether it will soon demand a reaction, will probably depend in the  first place on the soberness and thoroughness of the discussion. If the  movement is carried on under the control of science, it may yield  lasting results. If it keeps the features of dilettanteism and prefers  association with the antiscientific tendencies, it is pre-destined to  have a spasmodic character and ultimately to be harmful.    The chaotic character of psychotherapy in this first decade of the  twentieth century can be easily understood.

I offer no excuses, but will give what  reasons I have for committing to paper these my reflections or  meditations inspired by the sight of a fine old capital city as seen  from a Terrace in Prague.    The first reason I wish to give may be altruistic, namely, that finding  so many of my race quite ignorant of Prague and all that city stands for  right down the ages, I feel compelled to add my mite to what has already  been written about the subject.    My second reason, a strong one with me, arises out of my inability to  enjoy things of beauty and interest without letting my friends know  about them. This may be a weak and selfish reason, but there it is.    The third reason rests on my intense desire that you should come out  here, to Prague, even to the terrace of my choice, and look at the scene  through my eyes while I would endeavour to see it through yours. This, I  admit, is undiluted selfishness on my part.    While awaiting you, I am preparing, by means of this work, to introduce  you to a goodly throng of those who know or knew this city and loved it  well. Perhaps they may admit me to their round table as the last to  arrive, and the least. In any case, I owe them a debt of gratitude for  their help in becoming acquainted with Prague and the deeper meaning of  this glorious city. There are many such kindly helpers: there was Cosmas  Pragensis the chronicler, Palacky the historian, there was Count Luetzow,  whose works on Prague, as on his native country, are inspired by intense  love of them, and illumined by transparent honesty. There are others  still among us and doing useful work. A walk with Dr. Je[vr]abek in the  gardens of Waldstein's palace, a talk with Professor [vS]kola, and many  other good friends of mine in Prague, have made a pleasure of this work  I have undertaken. Out of sheer joy in the things I have seen and heard,  and the kindly spirit that informed those who helped me, have I written  and illustrated this book _From a Terrace in Prague_.          +-------------------------------------------------+  |Transcriber's note:                              |  |                                                 |  |In this text the caron has been represented with |  |                                                 |  |[vx] [vX] etc.                                   |  +-------------------------------------------------+          CONTENTS                                                                          PAGE    PREFACE                                                                7      CHAPTER I    INTRODUCES PRAGUE                                                     14      CHAPTER II    ABOUT GUIDES AND GUIDE BOOKS AND THE WEATHER OF PRAGUE                32      CHAPTER III    VY[vS]EHRAD, LIBU[vS]A AND P[vR]EMYSL, AND OTHER EARLY NOTABLES OF  PRAGUE, AMONG THEM ST.

Indicates the routes by which Prague may be reached by the  traveller from the West, tells a wayside story or two and mentions  several very great people, also others of a less degree. Digresses  seriously from the purpose of the whole book by raking up the author's  personal recollections of people that lived and events that happened  right away back in the last century, and far away in the East.    The author then formally introduces a friend, the ancient and venerable  City of Prague.      The Psalmist once declared in a burst of enthusiasm, no doubt justified,  that \"Jerusalem is a city that is at unity in itself.\" This remark  applies with equal right to other great historic cities, as who can deny  it that has stood in the \"Place de l'Opera\" and felt that Paris is  indeed at unity in itself?... Or who that has looked upon Constantinople  rising out of the pearly depths of the Sea of Marmora will fail to  realize that the city of Constantine, despite its many vicissitudes, was  indeed a united whole fulfilling its sometime tragic destiny in the  history of mankind?    Lisbon, mirrored in the broad waters of the Tagus, is another such city,  and so, in yet more marked degree, is Prague. The Psalmist, in poetic  exuberance, may appear to have overstated the case, allowance must be  made for him, but in the main he was right. The city of Zion had grown  up at the feet of the temple of David, and its massive strength  impressed the poet who overlooked the bickerings, the quarrels, of the  \"dwellers therein\"; he knew his city was the centre of his race, for  \"thither the tribes go up,\" and he took in only the big enduring things;  he held the key to the soul of the city.    Let us, then, approach the city of Prague in the right manner, prepared  to enter into the spirit of the place, to realize what it stands for,  what it has always stood for since those dim days when legend and  history entwined.    It is said that \"all roads lead to Rome\"; as many lead to Prague, as a  glance at the map will show.
