Whilst Western Europe  in turn submitted and struggled against a sub-lieutenant who made  himself an emperor, who at his pleasure made kings and destroyed  kingdoms, the ancient eastern part of the Continent; like mummies which  preserve but the semblance of life, was gradually tumbling to pieces,  and getting parcelled out amongst bold adventurers who skirmished over  its ruins. Without mentioning local revolts which produced only  short-lived struggles and trifling changes, of administration, such as  that of Djezzar Pacha, who refused to pay tribute because he thought  himself impregnable in his citadel of Saint-Jean-d'Acre, or that of  Passevend-Oglou Pacha, who planted himself on the walls of Widdin as  defender of the Janissaries against the institution of the regular  militia decreed by Sultan Selim at Stamboul, there were wider spread  rebellions which attacked the constitution of the Turkish Empire and  diminished its extent; amongst them that of Czerni-Georges, which raised  Servia to the position of a free state; of Mahomet Ali, who made his  pachalik of Egypt into a kingdom; and finally that of the man whose,  history we are about to narrate, Ali Tepeleni, Pacha of Janina, whose  long resistance to the suzerain power preceded and brought about the  regeneration of Greece.    Ali's own will counted for nothing in this important movement. He  foresaw it, but without ever seeking to aid it, and was powerless to  arrest it. He was not one of those men who place their lives and  services at the disposal of any cause indiscriminately; and his sole aim  was to acquire and increase a power of which he was both the guiding  influence, and the end and object. His nature contained the seeds of  every human passion, and he devoted all his long life to their  development and gratification. This explains his whole temperament; his  actions were merely the natural outcome of his character confronted with  circumstances. Few men have understood themselves better or been on  better terms with the orbit of their existence, and as the personality  of an individual is all the more striking, in proportion as it reflects  the manners and ideas of the time and country in which he has lived, so  the figure of Ali Pacha stands out, if not one of the most brilliant, at  least one of the most singular in contemporary history.    From the middle of the eighteenth century Turkey had been a prey to the  political gangrene of which she is vainly trying to cure herself to-day,  and which, before long, will dismember her in the sight of all Europe.  Anarchy and disorder reigned from one end of the empire to the other.  The Osmanli race, bred on conquest alone, proved good for nothing when  conquest failed. It naturally therefore came to pass when Sobieski, who  saved Christianity under the walls of Vienna, as before his time Charles  Martel had saved it on the plains of Poitiers, had set bounds to the  wave of Mussulman westward invasion, and definitely fixed a limit which  it should not pass, that the Osmanli warlike instincts recoiled upon  themselves. The haughty descendants of Ortogrul, who considered  themselves born to command, seeing victory forsake them, fell back upon  tyranny. Vainly did reason expostulate that oppression could not long be  exercised by hands which had lost their strength, and that peace imposed  new and different labours on those who no longer triumphed in war; they  would listen to nothing; and, as fatalistic when condemned to a state of  peace as when they marched forth conquering and to conquer, they cowered  down in magnificent listlessness, leaving the whole burden of their  support on conquered peoples. Like ignorant farmers, who exhaust fertile  fields by forcing crops; they rapidly ruined their vast and rich empire  by exorbitant exactions. Inexorable conquerors and insatiable masters,  with one hand they flogged their slaves and with the other plundered  them. Nothing was superior to their insolence, nothing on a level with  their greed. They were never glutted, and never relaxed their  extortions. But in proportion as their needs increased on the one hand,  so did their resources diminish on the other. Their oppressed subjects  soon found that they must escape at any cost from oppressors whom they  could neither appease nor satisfy. Each population took the steps best  suited to its position and character; some chose inertia, others  violence. The inhabitants of the plains, powerless and shelterless, bent  like reeds before the storm and evaded the shock against which they were  unable to stand. The mountaineers planted themselves like rocks in a  torrent, and dammed its course with all their might. On both sides arose  a determined resistance, different in method, similar in result. In the  case of the peasants labour came to a stand-still; in that of the hill  folk open war broke out. The grasping exactions of the tyrant dominant  body produced nothing from waste lands and armed mountaineers;  destitution and revolt were equally beyond their power to cope with; and  all that was left for tyranny to govern was a desert enclosed by a wall.    But, all the same, the wants of a magnificent sultan, descendant of the  Prophet and distributor of crowns, must be supplied; and to do this, the  Sublime Porte needed money. Unconsciously imitating the Roman Senate,  the Turkish Divan put up the empire for sale by public auction. All  employments were sold to the highest bidder; pachas, beys, cadis,  ministers of every rank, and clerks of every class had to buy their  posts from their sovereign and get the money back out of his subjects.  They spent their money in the capital, and recuperated themselves in the  provinces. And as there was no other law than their master's pleasure,  so there, was no other guarantee than his caprice. They had therefore to  set quickly to work; the post might be lost before its cost had been  recovered. Thus all the science of administration resolved itself into  plundering as much and as quickly as possible. To this end, the delegate  of imperial power delegated in his turn, on similar conditions, other  agents to seize for him and for themselves all they could lay their  hands on; so that the inhabitants of the empire might be divided into  three classes--those who were striving to seize everything; those who  were trying to save a little; and those who, having nothing and hoping  for nothing, took no interest in affairs at all.    Albania was one of the most difficult provinces to manage. Its  inhabitants were poor, brave, and, the nature of the country was  mountainous and inaccessible. The pashas had great difficulty in  collecting tribute, because the people were given to fighting for their  bread. Whether Mahomedans or Christians, the Albanians were above all  soldiers. Descended on the one side from the unconquerable Scythians, on  the other from the ancient Macedonians, not long since masters of the  world; crossed with Norman adventurers brought eastwards by the great  movement of the Crusades; they felt the blood of warriors flow in their  veins, and that war was their element. Sometimes at feud with one  another, canton against canton, village against village, often even  house against house; sometimes rebelling against the government their  sanjaks; sometimes in league with these against the sultan; they never  rested from combat except in an armed peace. Each tribe had its military  organisation, each family its fortified stronghold, each man his gun on  his shoulder. When they had nothing better to do, they tilled their  fields, or mowed their neighbours', carrying off, it should be noted,  the crop; or pastured their, flocks, watching the opportunity to  trespass over pasture limits. This was the normal and regular life of  the population of Epirus, Thesprotia, Thessaly, and Upper Albania. Lower  Albania, less strong, was also less active and bold; and there, as in  many other parts of Turkey, the dalesman was often the prey of the  mountaineer. It was in the mountain districts where were preserved the  recollections of Scander Beg, and where the manners of ancient Laconia  prevailed; the deeds of the brave soldier were sung on the lyre, and the  skilful robber quoted as an example to the children by the father of the  family. Village feasts were held on the booty taken from strangers; and  the favourite dish was always a stolen sheep. Every man was esteemed in  proportion to his skill and courage, and a man's chances of making a  good match were greatly enhanced when he acquired the reputation of  being an agile mountaineer and a good bandit.    The Albanians proudly called this anarchy liberty, and religiously  guarded a state of disorder bequeathed by their ancestors, which always  assured the first place to the most valiant.    It was amidst men and manners such as these that Ali Tepeleni was born.  He boasted that he belonged to the conquering race, and that he  descended from an ancient Anatolian family which had crossed into  Albania with the troops of Bajazet Ilderim. But it is made certain by  the learned researches of M. de Pouqueville that he sprang from a native  stock, and not an Asiatic one, as he pretended. His ancestors were  Christian Skipetars, who became Mussulmans after the Turkish invasion,  and his ancestry certainly cannot be traced farther back than the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2754"],[0,"The Countess of Saint Geran (#1)"],[1,"*THE COUNTESS DE SAINT-GERAN*                                      _By_                            *Alexandre Dumas, Pere*             _From the set of Eight Volumes of \"Celebrated Crimes\"_                                        1910          CONTENTS          *THE COUNTESS DE SAINT-GERAN--1639*          *THE COUNTESS DE SAINT-GERAN--1639*      About the end of the year 1639, a troop of horsemen arrived, towards  midday, in a little village at the northern extremity of the province of  Auvergne, from the direction of Paris. The country folk assembled at the  noise, and found it to proceed from the provost of the mounted police  and his men. The heat was excessive, the horses were bathed in sweat,  the horsemen covered with dust, and the party seemed on its return from  an important expedition. A man left the escort, and asked an old woman  who was spinning at her door if there was not an inn in the place. The  woman and her children showed him a bush hanging over a door at the end  of the only street in the village, and the escort recommenced its march  at a walk. There was noticed, among the mounted men, a young man of  distinguished appearance and richly dressed, who appeared to be a  prisoner. This discovery redoubled the curiosity of the villagers, who  followed the cavalcade as far as the door of the wine-shop. The host  came out, cap in hand, and the provost enquired of him with a swaggering  air if his pothouse was large enough to accommodate his troop, men and  horses. The host replied that he had the best wine in the country to  give to the king's servants, and that it would be easy to collect in the  neighbourhood litter and forage enough for their horses. The provost  listened contemptuously to these fine promises, gave the necessary  orders as to what was to be done, and slid off his horse, uttering an  oath proceeding from heat and fatigue. The horsemen clustered round the  young man: one held his stirrup, and the provost deferentially gave way  to him to enter the inn first. No, more doubt could be entertained that  he was a prisoner of importance, and all kinds of conjectures were made.  The men maintained that he must be charged with a great crime, otherwise  a young nobleman of his rank would never have been arrested; the women  argued, on the contrary, that it was impossible for such a pretty youth  not to be innocent.    Inside the inn all was bustle: the serving-lads ran from cellar to  garret; the host swore and despatched his servant-girls to the  neighbours, and the hostess scolded her daughter, flattening her nose  against the panes of a downstairs window to admire the handsome youth.    There were two tables in the principal eating-room. The provost took  possession of one, leaving the other to the soldiers, who went in turn  to tether their horses under a shed in the back yard; then he pointed to  a stool for the prisoner, and seated himself opposite to him, rapping  the table with his thick cane.    \"Ouf!\" he cried, with a fresh groan of weariness, \"I heartily beg your  pardon, marquis, for the bad wine I am giving you!\"    The young man smiled gaily.    \"The wine is all very well, monsieur provost,\" said he, \"but I cannot  conceal from you that however agreeable your company is to me, this halt  is very inconvenient; I am in a hurry to get through my ridiculous  situation, and I should have liked to arrive in time to stop this affair  at once.\"    The girl of the house was standing before the table with a pewter pot  which she had just brought, and at these words she raised her eyes on  the prisoner, with a reassured look which seemed to say, \"I was sure  that he was innocent.\"    \"But,\" continued the marquis, carrying the glass to his lips, \"this wine  is not so bad as you say, monsieur provost.\"    Then turning to the girl, who was eyeing his gloves and his ruff--    \"To your health, pretty child.\"    \"Then,\" said the provost, amazed at this free and easy air, \"perhaps I  shall have to beg you to excuse your sleeping quarters.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed the marquis, \"do we sleep here?\"    \"My lord;\" said the provost, \"we have sixteen long leagues to make, our  horses are done up, and so far as I am concerned I declare that I am no  better than my horse.\"    The marquis knocked on the table, and gave every indication of being  greatly annoyed. The provost meanwhile puffed and blowed, stretched out  his big boots, and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. He was a  portly man, with a puffy face, whom fatigue rendered singularly  uncomfortable.    \"Marquis,\" said he, \"although your company, which affords me the  opportunity of showing you some attention, is very precious to me, you  cannot doubt that I had much rather enjoy it on another footing. If it  be within your power, as you say, to release yourself from the hands of  justice, the sooner you do so the better I shall be pleased. But I beg  you to consider the state we are in. For my part, I am unfit to keep the  saddle another hour, and are you not yourself knocked up by this forced  march in the great heat?\"    \"True, so I am,\" said the marquis, letting his arms fall by his side.    \"Well, then, let us rest here, sup here, if we can, and we will start  quite fit in the cool of the morning.\"    \"Agreed,\" replied the marquis; \"but then let us pass the time in a  becoming manner. I have two pistoles left, let them be given to these  good fellows to drink. It is only fair that I should treat them, seeing  that I am the cause of giving them so much trouble.\"    He threw two pieces of money on the table of the soldiers, who cried in  chorus, \"Long live M. the marquis!\" The provost rose, went to post  sentinels, and then repaired to the kitchen, where he ordered the best  supper that could be got. The men pulled out dice and began to drink and  play. The marquis hummed an air in the middle of the room, twirled his  moustache, turning on his heel and looking cautiously around; then he  gently drew a purse from his trousers pocket, and as the daughter of the  house was coming and going, he threw his arms round her neck as if to  kiss her, and whispered, slipping ten Louis into her hand--    \"The key of the front door in my room, and a quart of liquor to the  sentinels, and you save my life.\"    The girl went backwards nearly to the door, and returning with an  expressive look, made an affirmative sign with her hand. The provost  returned, and two hours later supper was served. He ate and drank like a  man more at home at table than in the saddle. The marquis plied him with  bumpers, and sleepiness, added to the fumes of a very heady wine, caused  him to repeat over and over again--    \"Confound it all, marquis, I can't believe you are such a blackguard as  they say you are; you seem to me a jolly good sort.\"    The marquis thought he was ready to fall under the table, and was  beginning to open negotiations with the daughter of the house, when, to  his great disappointment, bedtime having come, the provoking provost  called his sergeant, gave him instructions in an undertone, and  announced that he should have the honour of conducting M. the marquis to  bed, and that he should not go to bed himself before performing this  duty. In fact, he posted three of his men, with torches, escorted the  prisoner to his room, and left him with many profound bows.    The marquis threw himself on his bed without pulling off his boots,  listening to a clock which struck nine. He heard the men come and go in  the stables and in the yard.    An hour later, everybody being tired, all was perfectly still. The  prisoner then rose softly, and felt about on tiptoe on the chimneypiece,  on the furniture, and even in his clothes, for the key which he hoped to  find. He could not find it. He could not be mistaken, nevertheless, in  the tender interest of the young girl, and he could not believe that she  was deceiving him. The marquis's room had a window which opened upon the  street, and a door which gave access to a shabby gallery which did duty  for a balcony, whence a staircase ascended to the principal rooms of the  house. This gallery hung over the courtyard, being as high above it as  the window was from the street. The marquis had only to jump over one  side or the other: he hesitated for some time, and just as he was  deciding to leap into the street, at the risk of breaking his neck, two  taps were struck on the door. He jumped for joy, saying to himself as he  opened, \"I am saved!\" A kind of shadow glided into the room; the young  girl trembled from head to foot, and could not say a word. The marquis  reassured her with all sorts of caresses.    \"Ah, sir,\" said she, \"I am dead if we are surprised.\"    \"Yes,\" said the marquis, \"but your fortune is made if you get me out of  here.\"    \"God is my witness that I would with all my soul, but I have such a bad  piece of news----\"    She stopped, suffocated with varying emotions. The poor girl had come  barefooted, for fear of making a noise, and appeared to be shivering.    \"What is the matter?\" impatiently asked the marquis.    \"Before going to bed,\" she continued, \"M. the provost has required from  my father all the keys of the house, and has made him take a great oath  that there are no more. My father has given him all: besides, there is a  sentinel at every door; but they are very tired; I have heard them  muttering and grumbling, and I have given them more wine than you told  me.\"    \"They will sleep,\" said the marquis, nowise discouraged, \"and they have  already shown great respect to my rank in not nailing me up in this  room.\"    \"There is a small kitchen garden,\" continued the girl, \"on the side of  the fields, fenced in only by a loose hurdle, but----\"    \"Where is my horse?\"    \"No doubt in the shed with the rest.\"    \"I will jump into the yard.\"    \"You will be killed.\"    \"So much the better!\"    \"Ah monsieur marquis, what have, you done?\" said the young girl with  grief.    \"Some foolish"]]]
