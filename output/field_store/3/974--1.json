This volume contains all the essays on the Chalicodomae, or Mason-bees  proper, which so greatly enhance the interest of the early volumes of  the \"Souvenirs entomologiques.\" I have also included an essay on the  author's Cats and one on Red Ants--the only study of Ants comprised  in the \"Souvenirs\"--both of which bear upon the sense of direction  possessed by the Bees. Those treating of the Osmiae, who are also  Mason-Bees, although not usually known by that name, will be found in  a separate volume, which I have called \"Bramble-bees and Others\" and  in which I have collected all that Fabre has written on such other Wild  Bees as the Megachiles, or Leaf-cutters, the Cotton-bees, the Resin-bees  and the Halicti.    The essays entitled \"The Mason-bees, Experiments\" and \"Exchanging the  Nests\" form the last three chapters of \"Insect Life\", translated by the  author of \"Mademoiselle Mori\" and published by Messrs. Macmillan, who,  with the greatest courtesy and kindness have given me their permission  to include a new translation of these chapters in the present volume.  They did so without fee or consideration of any kind, merely on my  representation that it would be a great pity if this uniform edition  of Fabre's Works should be rendered incomplete because certain essays  formed part of volumes of extracts previously published in this country.  Their generosity is almost unparalleled in my experience; and I wish  to thank them publicly for it in the name of the author, of the French  publishers and of the English and American publishers, as well as in my  own.    Some of the chapters have appeared in England in the \"Daily Mail\", the  \"Fortnightly Review\" and the \"English Review\"; some in America in \"Good  Housekeeping\" and the \"Youth's Companion\"; others now see the light in  English for the first time.    I have again to thank Miss Frances Rodwell for the invaluable assistance  which she has given me in the work of translation and in the less  interesting and more tedious department of research.

Reaumur (Rene Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur (1683-1757), inventor of the  Reaumur thermometer and author of \"Memoires pour servir a l'histoire  naturelle des insectes.\"--Translator's Note.) devoted one of his  papers to the story of the Chalicodoma of the Walls, whom he calls  the Mason-bee. I propose to go on with the story, to complete it and  especially to consider it from a point of view wholly neglected by that  eminent observer. And, first of all, I am tempted to tell how I made  this Bee's acquaintance.    It was when I first began to teach, about 1843. I had left the normal  school at Vaucluse some months before, with my diploma and all the  simple enthusiasm of my eighteen years, and had been sent to Carpentras,  there to manage the primary school attached to the college. It was  a strange school, upon my word, notwithstanding its pompous title of  'upper'; a sort of huge cellar oozing with the perpetual damp engendered  by a well backing on it in the street outside. For light there was the  open door, when the weather permitted, and a narrow prison-window, with  iron bars and lozenge panes set in lead. By way of benches there was a  plank fastened to the wall all round the room, while in the middle was a  chair bereft of its straw, a black-board and a stick of chalk.    Morning and evening, at the sound of the bell, there came rushing in  some fifty young imps who, having shown themselves hopeless dunces with  their Cornelius Nepos, had been relegated, in the phrase of the day,  to 'a few good years of French.' Those who had found mensa too much for  them came to me to get a smattering of grammar. Children and strapping  lads were there, mixed up together, at very different educational  stages, but all incorrigibly agreed to play tricks upon the master, the  boy master who was no older than some of them, or even younger.    To the little ones I gave their first lessons in reading; the  intermediate ones I showed how they should hold their pen to write a  few lines of dictation on their knees; to the big ones I revealed the  secrets of fractions and even the mysteries of Euclid. And to keep this  restless crowd in order, to give each mind work in accordance with its  strength, to keep attention aroused and lastly to expel dullness from  the gloomy room, whose walls dripped melancholy even more than dampness,  my one resource was my tongue, my one weapon my stick of chalk.    For that matter, there was the same contempt in the other classes for  all that was not Latin or Greek. One instance will be enough to show  how things then stood with the teaching of physics, the science which  occupies so large a place to-day. The principal of the college was a  first-rate man, the worthy Abbe X., who, not caring to dispense beans  and bacon himself, had left the commissariat-department to a relative  and had undertaken to teach the boys physics.    Let us attend one of his lessons. The subject is the barometer. The  establishment happens to possess one, an old apparatus, covered with  dust, hanging on the wall beyond the reach of profane hands and bearing  on its face, in large letters, the words stormy, rain, fair.    'The barometer,' says the good abbe, addressing his pupils, whom, in  patriarchal fashion, he calls by their Christian names, 'the barometer  tells us if the weather will be good or bad. You see the words written  on the face--stormy, rain--do you see, Bastien?'    'Yes, I see,' says Bastien, the most mischievous of the lot.    He has been looking through his book and knows more about the barometer  than his teacher does.    'It consists,' the abbe continues, 'of a bent glass tube filled with  mercury, which rises and falls according to the weather. The shorter  leg of this tube is open; the other...the other...well, we'll see. Here,  Bastien, you're the tallest, get up on the chair and just feel with your  finger if the long leg is open or closed. I can't remember for certain.'    Bastien climbs on the chair, stands as high as he can on tip-toe and  fumbles with his finger at the top of the long column. Then, with a  discreet smile spreading under the silky hairs of his dawning moustache:    'Yes,' he says, 'that's it. The long leg is open at the top. There, I  can feel the hole.'    And Bastien, to confirm his mendacious statement, keeps wriggling  his forefinger at the top of the tube, while his fellow-conspirators  suppress their enjoyment as best they can.    'That will do,' says the unconscious abbe. 'You can get down, Bastien.  Take a note of it, boys: the longer leg of the barometer is open; take a  note of it. It's a thing you might forget; I had forgotten it myself.'    Thus was physics taught. Things improved, however: a master came and  came to stay, one who knew that the long leg of the barometer is closed.  I myself secured tables on which my pupils were able to write instead  of scribbling on their knees; and, as my class was daily increasing  in numbers, it ended by being divided into two. As soon as I had an  assistant to look after the younger boys, things assumed a different  aspect.    Among the subjects taught, one in particular appealed to both masters  and pupils. This was open-air geometry, practical surveying. The college  had none of the necessary outfit; but, with my fat pay--seven hundred  francs a year, if you please!--I could not hesitate over the expense.  A surveyor's chain and stakes, arrows, level, square and compass were  bought with my money. A microscopic graphometer, not much larger than  the palm of one's hand and costing perhaps five francs, was provided  by the establishment. There was no tripod to it; and I had one made. In  short, my equipment was complete.    And so, when May came, once every week we left the gloomy school-room  for the fields. It was a regular holiday. The boys disputed for the  honour of carrying the stakes, divided into bundles of three; and more  than one shoulder, as we walked through the town, felt the reflected  glory of those erudite rods. I myself--why conceal the fact?--was not  without a certain satisfaction as I piously carried that most delicate  and precious apparatus, the historic five-franc graphometer. The scene  of operations was an untilled, flinty plain, a harmas, as we call it in  the district. (Cf. \"The Life of the Fly\", by J. Henri Fabre, translated  by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chapter 1.--Translator's Note.) Here,  no curtain of green hedges or shrubs prevented me from keeping an  eye upon my staff; here--an indispensable condition--I had not the  irresistible temptation of the unripe apricots to fear for my scholars.  The plain stretched far and wide, covered with nothing but flowering  thyme and rounded pebbles. There was ample scope for every imaginable  polygon; trapezes and triangles could be combined in all sorts of ways.  The inaccessible distances had ample elbow-room; and there was even  an old ruin, once a pigeon-house, that lent its perpendicular to the  graphometer's performances.    Well, from the very first day, my attention was attracted by something  suspicious. If I sent one of the boys to plant a stake, I would see him  stop frequently on his way, bend down, stand up again, look about and  stoop once more, neglecting his straight line and his signals.

E'en so the world of men may turn     At even of some hurried day     And see the ancient glimmer burn     Across the waste that hath no way;     Then with that faint light in its eyes     A while I bid it linger near     And nurse in wavering memories     The bitter-sweet of days that were.          CHAPTER I--THE DWELLINGS OF MID-MARK      The tale tells that in times long past there was a dwelling of men beside  a great wood.  Before it lay a plain, not very great, but which was, as  it were, an isle in the sea of woodland, since even when you stood on the  flat ground, you could see trees everywhere in the offing, though as for  hills, you could scarce say that there were any; only swellings-up of the  earth here and there, like the upheavings of the water that one sees at  whiles going on amidst the eddies of a swift but deep stream.    On either side, to right and left the tree-girdle reached out toward the  blue distance, thick close and unsundered, save where it and the plain  which it begirdled was cleft amidmost by a river about as wide as the  Thames at Sheene when the flood-tide is at its highest, but so swift and  full of eddies, that it gave token of mountains not so far distant,  though they were hidden.  On each side moreover of the stream of this  river was a wide space of stones, great and little, and in most places  above this stony waste were banks of a few feet high, showing where the  yearly winter flood was most commonly stayed.    You must know that this great clearing in the woodland was not a matter  of haphazard; though the river had driven a road whereby men might fare  on each side of its hurrying stream.  It was men who had made that Isle  in the woodland.    For many generations the folk that now dwelt there had learned the craft  of iron-founding, so that they had no lack of wares of iron and steel,  whether they were tools of handicraft or weapons for hunting and for war.  It was the men of the Folk, who coming adown by the river-side had made  that clearing.  The tale tells not whence they came, but belike from the  dales of the distant mountains, and from dales and mountains and plains  further aloof and yet further.    Anyhow they came adown the river; on its waters on rafts, by its shores  in wains or bestriding their horses or their kine, or afoot, till they  had a mind to abide; and there as it fell they stayed their travel, and  spread from each side of the river, and fought with the wood and its wild  things, that they might make to themselves a dwelling-place on the face  of the earth.    So they cut down the trees, and burned their stumps that the grass might  grow sweet for their kine and sheep and horses; and they diked the river  where need was all through the plain, and far up into the wild-wood to  bridle the winter floods: and they made them boats to ferry them over,  and to float down stream and track up-stream: they fished the river's  eddies also with net and with line; and drew drift from out of it of far-  travelled wood and other matters; and the gravel of its shallows they  washed for gold; and it became their friend, and they loved it, and gave  it a name, and called it the Dusky, and the Glassy, and the  Mirkwood-water; for the names of it changed with the generations of man.    There then in the clearing of the wood that for many years grew greater  yearly they drave their beasts to pasture in the new-made meadows, where  year by year the grass grew sweeter as the sun shone on it and the  standing waters went from it; and now in the year whereof the tale  telleth it was a fair and smiling plain, and no folk might have a better  meadow.    But long before that had they learned the craft of tillage and taken heed  to the acres and begun to grow wheat and rye thereon round about their  roofs; the spade came into their hands, and they bethought them of the  plough-share, and the tillage spread and grew, and there was no lack of  bread.    In such wise that Folk had made an island amidst of the Mirkwood, and  established a home there, and upheld it with manifold toil too long to  tell of.  And from the beginning this clearing in the wood they called  the Mid-mark: for you shall know that men might journey up and down the  Mirkwood-water, and half a day's ride up or down they would come on  another clearing or island in the woods, and these were the Upper-mark  and the Nether-mark: and all these three were inhabited by men of one  folk and one kindred, which was called the Mark-men, though of many  branches was that stem of folk, who bore divers signs in battle and at  the council whereby they might be known.    Now in the Mid-mark itself were many Houses of men; for by that word had  they called for generations those who dwelt together under one token of  kinship.  The river ran from South to North, and both on the East side  and on the West were there Houses of the Folk, and their habitations were  shouldered up nigh unto the wood, so that ever betwixt them and the river  was there a space of tillage and pasture.    Tells the tale of one such House, whose habitations were on the west side  of the water, on a gentle slope of land, so that no flood higher than  common might reach them.  It was straight down to the river mostly that  the land fell off, and on its downward-reaching slopes was the tillage,  \"the Acres,\" as the men of that time always called tilled land; and  beyond that was the meadow going fair and smooth, though with here and  there a rising in it, down to the lips of the stony waste of the winter  river.    Now the name of this House was the Wolfings, and they bore a Wolf on  their banners, and their warriors were marked on the breast with the  image of the Wolf, that they might be known for what they were if they  fell in battle, and were stripped.    The house, that is to say the Roof, of the Wolfings of the Mid-mark stood  on the topmost of the slope aforesaid with its back to the wild-wood and  its face to the acres and the water.  But you must know that in those  days the men of one branch of kindred dwelt under one roof together, and  had therein their place and dignity; nor were there many degrees amongst  them as hath befallen afterwards, but all they of one blood were brethren  and of equal dignity.  Howbeit they had servants or thralls, men taken in  battle, men of alien blood, though true it is that from time to time were  some of such men taken into the House, and hailed as brethren of the  blood.    Also (to make an end at once of these matters of kinship and affinity)  the men of one House might not wed the women of their own House: to the  Wolfing men all Wolfing women were as sisters: they must needs wed with  the Hartings or the Elkings or the Bearings, or other such Houses of the  Mark as were not so close akin to the blood of the Wolf; and this was a  law that none dreamed of breaking.  Thus then dwelt this Folk and such  was their Custom.    As to the Roof of the Wolfings, it was a great hall and goodly, after the  fashion of their folk and their day; not built of stone and lime, but  framed of the goodliest trees of the wild-wood squared with the adze, and  betwixt the framing filled with clay wattled with reeds.  Long was that  house, and at one end anigh the gable was the Man's-door, not so high  that a man might stand on the threshold and his helmcrest clear the  lintel; for such was the custom, that a tall man must bow himself as he  came into the hall; which custom maybe was a memory of the days of  onslaught when the foemen were mostly wont to beset the hall; whereas in  the days whereof the tale tells they drew out into the fields and fought  unfenced; unless at whiles when the odds were over great, and then they  drew their wains about them and were fenced by the wain-burg.  At least  it was from no niggardry that the door was made thus low, as might be  seen by the fair and manifold carving of knots and dragons that was  wrought above the lintel of the door for some three foot's space.  But a  like door was there anigh the other gable-end, whereby the women entered,  and it was called the Woman's-door.    Near to the house on all sides except toward the wood were there many  bowers and cots round about the penfolds and the byres: and these were  booths for the stowage of wares, and for crafts and smithying that were  unhandy to do in the house; and withal they were the dwelling-places of  the thralls.  And the lads and young men often abode there many days and  were cherished there of the thralls that loved them, since at whiles they  shunned the Great Roof that they might be the freer to come and go at  their pleasure, and deal as they would.  Thus was there a clustering on  the slopes and bents betwixt the acres of the Wolfings and the wild-wood  wherein dwelt the wolves.    As to the house within, two rows of pillars went down it endlong,  fashioned of the mightiest trees that might be found, and each one fairly  wrought with base and chapiter, and wreaths and knots, and fighting men  and dragons; so that it was like a church of later days that has a nave  and aisles: windows there were above the aisles, and a passage underneath  the said windows in their roofs.  In the aisles were the sleeping-places  of the Folk, and down the nave under the crown of the roof were three  hearths for the fires, and above each hearth a luffer or smoke-bearer to  "]]]
