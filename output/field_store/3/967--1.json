Scientific and Religious Journal.    VOL. I. DECEMBER, 1880. NO. 12.          IS THE SINNER A MORAL AGENT IN HIS CONVERSION?      There are a great many questions asked upon the subject of conversion,  and as many answers given as there are theories of religion, and many  persons listening to men's theories upon this subject are left in doubt  and darkness in reference to what is and is not conversion. You ask the  Mormons, who fully believe their theory of conversion, and they will  refer you to their own experience and the experience of the loyal,  self-sacrificing devotees of their faith. Ask the Roman Catholic and he  will give you an answer corresponding with his theory of religion. All  Protestant parties give you their experience, and refer you to their  loyal and self-sacrificing brethren for the truthfulness of their  theories of conversion. In the midst of this conflict and medley of  contradictions what are we to do? Shall we accept their experience as  the infallible rule by which to determine the right from the wrong in  matters pertaining to our present and eternal salvation? A strange rule,  in view of the great contrariety of opinions and our liability to be  misled. It would justify Mother Eve, she being deceived. But \"she was  found in the transgression.\" We may be deceived and found in  transgression. This strange rule would justify Saul; for he verily  thought he ought to do many things contrary to Jesus, which things he  did, and did them in all good conscience towards God and man, yet he was  a blasphemer and injurious. The Master, in view of our liability to be  deceived, gave us a rule of conduct in reference to our communications  in these words: \"Let your communications be yea, yea, and nay, nay.\" It  requires heroism and manhood, which is the highest degree of moral  courage, to say nay where questions of personal interest are involved.    The rule in reference to God's word is different, being based upon his  immutability and perfections. He is not deceived, not misled, not  mistaken. Paul says in reference to the word of God, which was preached  by himself, Sylvanus and Timotheus: \"Our word toward you was not yea and  nay, but in him was yea, for all the promises of God in Christ are yea,  and in him amen unto the glory of God by us.\" 2 Cor. 1, 18-20. \"Let God  be true though every man be a liar,\" was in the times of the Apostles  and first Christians a rule which they had no hesitancy in affirming. A  moral agent is one who, with a knowledge of the right and wrong,  exercises the power of action. In conversion it is the exercise of the  power that begins conversion. If the sinner has not this power, then he  is not a moral agent in his conversion. All the differences among men  upon the subject of conversion grew out of their different notions of  God and of men. It is a matter of the greatest consequence to have  correct notions of God and of self. As conversion relates to both, wrong  notions of one will create wrong notions of the other. Those who have  been taught to debase themselves under the pretext of giving glory to  God, consider meanness and wrong as natural and inherent imperfections  of their being, and attributable to Father Adam and Mother Eve, and  neglect to exercise the powers at their command. Being taught that they  are unable to do anything to help themselves, they are left to throw the  work all back upon God or give it up in despair. If they throw it back  upon God, and regard themselves as passive recipients of the work of  conversion, then they must wrestle with God, for there is no use in  wrestling with the powerless one.    With this view of the subject the world's condition is incomprehensible,  and in direct conflict with the revealed character of God. We would  naturally suppose when we read that \"God is not willing that any should  perish, but that all should come to repentance,\" that none would be  allowed to perish on account of any neglect upon the divine side. But  thousands do die in their sins. Do you say it is because of their great  wickedness? In what does wickedness consist? Is it the neglect of that  which is not in their power? Does not the system that God interposes in  the conversion of the sinner rest upon the idea that the sinner is  helpless in respect to his conversion? It certainly does. Then why  should the sinner he blamed? This view of the sinner's moral condition  necessitates a view of God utterly at variance with his character, viz:  that he is _now_ and _then_ on the giving hand, that he consents to pour  out his Spirit occasionally, and does this only where the good people  wrestle with him and give him no rest day nor night. One would think  that \"he who spared not his own son, but gave him up for us all,\" would  send that Almighty Spirit everywhere, and at once bring about the  millennial glory. What is the trouble? \"_God is love!_\" \"Tell them, as I  live, saith the Lord God, I have _no pleasure_ in the death of him who  dieth, but rather that he would repent and live.\" This theory of the  sinner's helplessness is the foundation of the entire system of mystical  conversion through mystical operations of the Spirit of God. And as for  plain and easy conditions of pardon and peace that we know all sinners  can comply with, this system of mystical conversion sets them all  _aside_. So you see that difficulties are multiplying on our hands, and  unless we can start off upon another foot, we must be lost in the  mystical and incomprehensible. As reformers, our greatest work is to  clear away mystical and false notions of men in reference to themselves  and their God; to make men sensible of their dignity and responsibility,  as beings endowed with God-like attributes.    We have succeeded, in most communities, in killing the _tap-root_ of the  mystical tree of conversion--_i.e._, the tenet of total hereditary  depravity, but the tree still stands erect, and men claim that a  wonderful outpouring of the Spirit of God has, in many days and nights,  resulted in 100 or 200 or 300 conversions. But what is conversion? It is  lexically defined \"_to turn upon, to turn towards_.\" In a moral sense,  \"_to turn upon or to, to convert unto, to convert from error, to turn to  the service and worship of the true God_.\" \"And all who dwelt at Lydda  and Saron saw him and _turned_ to the Lord.\" Acts ix, 35. The word  _turned_, in the above text, is a translation of the Greek term that is  nine times rendered _convert_ in its forms and thirty-eight times _turn_  in its forms. They, the people of Lydda and Saron, _turned, converted to  the Lord_. Did they do it? Then they were active and not passive. It was  an act of their own. \"Repent and turn yourselves.\"--Eze. xviii, 30. Here  the Lord commanded sinners to _convert themselves_. \"Cast away from you  all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed, and make you a  new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"  Eze. xviii, 31. \"If the wicked will turn, convert, from all his sins  that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is  lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.\" Eze. xviii,  31. Here we discover that the burden of conversion and the entire  responsibility of an unconverted state is thrown upon the sinner.    The Apostles taught men to convert themselves. See Acts xiv, 15. \"We  also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye  should turn, _convert_, from these vanities to the living God.\" Paul  says, \"He showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem and  throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they  should turn, _convert_, to God, and do works meet for, worthy of,  repentance.\" Acts xxvi, 20. Speaking of the unbelieving Jews he said,  \"But their minds were blinded; for until this day remaineth the same  vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which vail is  done away in Christ. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the  vail is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall _turn_, _convert_,  to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.\" 2d Corinthians, iii, 14-16.  Here we find that the heart must do its own _turning_, _converting_.  _Poor Jews!_ Could they help themselves? Yes, it all depended upon their  own actions. The INFINITE ONE did as much for them as for any others.  They closed their eyes and stopped their ears, lest at _any time_ they  should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand  with their hearts, and be converted and healed. Why did the Master not  say, \"And I should _convert_ and heal them?\" _Ans._ Conversion is a  commandment of God, and sinners must obey it or perish.    The above quotation is made from Isaiah vi, 10, where it reads: \"Lest  they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and  understand with their hearts, and _convert_, and I should heal them.\"  Paul, speaking of the disciples in Macedonia and Achaia, says: \"They  themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and  how ye turned, _converted_, to God from idols to serve the living and  true God.\" 1 Thess., i, 8, 9. \"Repent ye therefore and be converted,\" is  passive in our translation, but imperative active in the original. In  the Geneva text it reads: \"_Amend_ your lives and turn. So conversion is  a commandment of God. If there is anything necessary to conversion that  is not in the power of the sinner, why should he be commanded to  convert? If the trouble is in his corruption, through inborn depravity,  why are _some converted_ and _others not_? If there is anything in  conversion that is not in the power of the sinner, then he must of  necessity be saved without it, or remain unavoidably in sin--_doomed to  misery_.\"    Webster defines the term _convert_ \"to change from one state to another,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28681"],[0,"The Cook's Oracle; and Housekeeper's Manual (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW-YORK, _ss._    BE IT REMEMBERED, That on the 20th day of November, A. D. 1829, in the  fifty-fourth year of the independence of the United States of America,  J. & J. HARPER, of the said district, have deposited in this office the  title of a book, the right whereof they claim as Proprietors, in the  words following, to wit:    \"The Cook's Oracle, and Housekeeper's Manual, Containing Receipts for  Cookery, and Directions for Carving; also the Art of Composing the most  simple and most highly finished Broths, Gravies, Soups, Sauces, Store  Sauces, and Flavouring Essences; Pastry, Preserves, Puddings, Pickles,  &c.

BETTS,    _Clerk of the Southern District of New-York._          ADVERTISEMENT.      The publishers have now the pleasure of presenting to the American  public, Dr. Kitchiner's justly celebrated work, entitled \"The Cook's  Oracle, and Housekeeper's Manual,\" with numerous and valuable  improvements, by a medical gentleman of this city.    The work contains a store of valuable information, which, it is  confidently believed, will not only prove highly advantageous to young  and inexperienced housekeepers, but also to more experienced matrons--to  all, indeed, who are desirous of enjoying, in the highest degree, the  good things which Nature has so abundantly bestowed upon us.    The \"Cook's Oracle\" has been adjudged, by connoisseurs in this country  and in Great Britain, to contain the best possible instructions on the  subject of serving up, beautifully and economically, the productions of  the water, land, and air, in such a manner as to render them most  pleasant to the eye, and agreeable to the palate.    Numerous notices, in commendation of the work, might be selected from  respectable European journals; but the mere fact, that within twelve  years, seventy thousand copies of it have been purchased by the English  public, is sufficient evidence of its reception and merits.    NEW-YORK, _December, 1829_.          PREFACE    TO    THE SEVENTH EDITION.      The whole of this Work has, a _seventh time_, been carefully revised;  but this last time I have found little to add, and little to alter.    I have bestowed as much attention on each of the 500 receipts as if the  whole merit of the book was to be estimated entirely by the accuracy of  my detail of one particular process.    The increasing demand for \"_The Cook's Oracle_,\" amounting in 1824 to  the extraordinary number of upwards of 45,000, has been stimulus enough  to excite any man to submit to the most unremitting study; and the  Editor has felt it as an imperative duty to exert himself to the utmost  to render \"_The Cook's Oracle_\" a faithful narrative of all that is  known of the various subjects it professes to treat.          PREFACE.      Among the multitudes of causes which concur to impair health and produce  disease, the most general is the improper quality of our food: this most  frequently arises from the injudicious manner in which it is prepared:  yet strange, \"passing strange,\" this is the only one for which a remedy  has not been sought; few persons bestow half so much attention on the  preservation of their own health, as they daily devote to that of their  dogs and horses.    The observations of the Guardians of Health respecting regimen, &c. have  formed no more than a catalogue of those articles of food, which they  have considered most proper for particular constitutions.    Some medical writers have, \"in good set terms,\" warned us against the  pernicious effects of improper diet; but not one has been so kind as to  take the trouble to direct us how to prepare food properly; excepting  only the contributions of Count Rumford, who says, in pages 16 and 70 of  his tenth Essay, \"however low and vulgar this subject has hitherto  generally been thought to be--_in what Art or Science could improvements  be made that would more powerfully contribute to increase the comforts  and enjoyments of mankind? Would to God! that I could fix the public  attention to this subject!_\"    The Editor has endeavoured to write the following receipts so plainly,  that they may be as easily understood in the kitchen as he trusts they  will be relished in the dining-room; and has been more ambitious to  present to the Public a Work which will contribute to the daily comfort  of all, than to seem elaborately scientific.    The practical part of the philosophy of the kitchen is certainly not the  most agreeable; gastrology has to contend with its full share of those  great impediments to all great improvements in scientific pursuits; the  prejudices of the ignorant, and the misrepresentations of the envious.    The sagacity to comprehend and estimate the importance of any  uncontemplated improvement, is confined to the very few on whom nature  has bestowed a sufficient degree of perfection of the sense which is to  measure it;--the candour to make a fair report of it, is still more  uncommon; and the kindness to encourage it cannot often be expected from  those whose most vital interest it is to prevent the developement of  that by which their own importance, perhaps their only means of  existence, may be for ever eclipsed: so, as Pope says, how many are        \"Condemn'd in business or in arts to drudge,      Without a rival, or without a judge:      All fear, none aid you, and few understand.\"    Improvements in _Agriculture_ and the _Breed of Cattle_ have been  encouraged by premiums. Those who have obtained them, have been hailed  as benefactors to society! but _the Art of_ making use of these means of  _ameliorating Life and supporting a healthful Existence_--COOKERY--has  been neglected!!    While the cultivators of the raw materials are distinguished and  rewarded, the attempt to improve the processes, without which neither  vegetable nor animal substances are fit for the food of man (astonishing  to say), has been ridiculed, as unworthy the attention of a rational  being!!    The most useful[vii-*] art--which the Editor has chosen to endeavour to  illustrate, because nobody else has, and because he knew not how he  could employ some leisure hours more beneficially for mankind, than to  teach them to combine the \"_utile_\" with the \"_dulce_,\" and to increase  their pleasures, without impairing their health, or impoverishing their  fortune, has been for many years his favourite employment; and \"THE ART  OF INVIGORATING AND PROLONGING LIFE BY FOOD, &C. &C.\" and this Work,  have insensibly become repositories for whatever observations he has  made which he thought would make us \"LIVE HAPPY, AND LIVE LONG!!!\"    The Editor has considered the ART OF"]]]
