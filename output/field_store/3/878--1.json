WITH 38 LINE BLOCK AND ONE COLLOTYPE ILLUSTRATIONS.                    BANKFIELD MUSEUM, HALIFAX                       APRIL 1913          PREFACE.      Halifax, which is situated in the heart of the great textile trade of  Lancashire and Yorkshire, has been a home of the woollen manufacture  since the earliest time, and it is only meet, therefore, that its  museum should possess specimens of the tools used in the early days of  spinning, weaving, and cloth making generally. In spite of the  considerable progress made towards that end, many typical specimens  are still wanting, and, while we have plenty of material for the study  of weaving in various parts of the world, we are lacking in everything  relating to the industry in Ancient Egypt and Greece. Failing  specimens I have had recourse to illustrations, but the Egyptian ones  published by Cailliaud, Rosellini, Sir J. G. Wilkinson and Lepsius,  contradict each other in many important points, so that those who  study them find them practically useless for an understanding of the  art as carried on in the Nile lands. Fortunately, last year, Mr. N. de  G. Davies, the well-known Egyptologist, hearing of my difficulty, very  generously placed some of his copies of tomb drawings at my disposal,  and with this invaluable help I have been enabled to complete the  present paper, and to lay before Halifax students some new details of  manufacture bearing upon their staple industry.                                                      H. Ling Roth.      Bankfield Museum, Halifax.    April 1913.          I. EGYPTIAN LOOMS.      HORIZONTAL LOOMS.[A]    In the tomb of Chnem-hotep, at Beni Hasan, there is a wall painting of  a horizontal loom with two weavers, women, squatting on either side,  and at the right in the background is drawn the figure of the  taskmaster. There are also figures represented in the act of spinning,  etc. For the present we are concerned with the weaving only.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from the  illustration in Cailliaud's _Recherches_, etc. Same size as  published.]    Of this illustration, there appear to be six reproductions. We have  first of all, Fig. 1, that of Fred. Cailliaud (_Recherches sur les  Arts et Metiers_, etc., Paris, 1831) with illustrations of drawings  made by himself in the years 1819 to 1822. His publication was  followed by Fig. 2, that of Sir J. G. Wilkinson (_Manners and  Customs_, etc., London, 1837). Mr. John Murray, whose house has  published Wilkinson's work from the first edition to the last, informs  me that a few of the drawings were made by George Scharf, afterwards  Sir George Scharf, Keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, but that  most of them seem to have been made by Joseph Bonomi, the well known  Egyptologist. Wilkinson's woodcut, although clearly and neatly done,  is on a very small scale; nevertheless it admits of a fair comparison  with those reproduced on a larger scale.

Same size as published.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from the  illustration in Rosellini's _Monumenti_ (Monumenti Civili), Plate XLI.  Reduced one-fifth lineal of size published.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from  Lepsius' _Denkmaeler_. Same size as published.]    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from  Prof. Percy Newberry's _Beni Hasan_, I. Plate 29. Same size as  published.]    After him, Fig. 3, N. F. J. B. Rosellini began the publication of his  great work (_I Monumenti dell' Egitto_, Pisa, 1832-1844). The  similarity between the comparatively few drawings published by  Cailliaud and the very large number published by Rosellini is very  great. It is of course quite possible Rosellini may have made use of  some of Cailliaud's drawings. Five years after Rosellini's publication  came that of C. R. Lepsius (_Denkmaeler_, Leipzig, 1849), Fig. 4, his  drawings having been made in the years 1842 to 1845. Since the time of  Lepsius until quite recent years I can trace no further copying until  we get the illustration, Fig. 5, in Prof. Percy Newberry's _Beni  Hasan_, London, 1910. In this work the reproduction is about one  twentieth of the original, or about three fifths of the size of that  of Wilkinson, and unfortunately so crude as not to be available for  our present purpose.[B] Lastly we have the reproduction, Fig. 6, from  Mr. N. de Garis Davies' drawing made in 1903, and now first published  by kind permission of Mr. F. Ll. Griffith.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep. Size of  original: Height of the figures 9-1/4\" = 24.4 cm. Drawn by Mr. N. de  G. Davies, and now published for the first time by permission of Mr.  F. Ll. Griffith.]    In the various reproductions by the above explorers, the only three  which agree very closely are those of Cailliaud, Rosellini and Davies.  The others vary considerably and in essentials do not agree with the  above nor with one another. The differences may in the first instance  be due to difficulties in copying the original in the tomb. Others may  be due to ignorance of detail on the part of the secondary  copyist--the man who prepared them for publication--so that he was  unable to follow up the clues on the drawings laid before him. The  differences may also be due to careless copying and to \"touching up\"  of the copies when made; they may be slightly due to deterioration and  obliteration of the original in the course of time.    The _Encyclopaedia Biblica_ gives a variant from all six illustrations,  but approaching nearest to that of Cailliaud, Rosellini and Davies. It  is misleading in so far that the drawing has been made to suit  Professor Kennedy's idea as to what it should be.    Some of the differences are of minor importance, but a comparison will  help materially to our understanding of the method of weaving adopted  by the Egyptians from the XIIth to the XIXth Dynasties, or about B.C.  2000 to 1200. To go into details, and taking Mr. N. de G. Davies'  illustration as our basis, we find slight differences in the shape of  the pegs B, B1, which are immaterial. A more pronounced difference is  seen in the way in which the threads are attached to the warp beam A.  Neither Wilkinson nor Lepsius carry these threads over the beam, the  former carrying them only as far as the laze threads C, while the  latter carries them up to a line drawn parallel to and below the beam;  Cailliaud and Rosellini carry them over the beam while Mr. Davies  carries them half way only. The object of this half carrying over is  not clear. The threads in chain-form at C are probably laze threads,  apparently placed there so that in case of any disarrangement of the  warp threads the weaver can from that point run her fingers along them  and get them disentangled. It has been suggested to me that this  chain-form might be a tension chain for taking up slack warp, but the  former explanation seems the more likely.    All the drawings but Wilkinson's show the warp threads converging  towards the breast beam; Wilkinson shows them parallel and in Lepsius  their convergence is excessive. There should be a slight convergence  shown, as in the course of weaving the threads get drawn in, and in  later forms of looms in semi-civilised countries we find an endeavour  to counteract this tendency by the use of a tool known as a \"temple.\"    The cross sticks D1, D2, look like laze rods. It may not be out of  place here to point out that in primitive weaving laze rods serve two  purposes, or one more than in the later somewhat more advanced looms.  They serve throughout to keep the warp threads in place, and they  serve to separate the odd threads from the even (1, 3, 5, 7 from 2, 4,  6, 8, &c.), and in so doing take the place of the fingers in making  the \"shed,\" _i.e._, the opening through which the \"weft (or woof)\" is  passed, a function which in turn is usurped by the \"heald (or  heddle).\" The heddle therefore becomes a very important factor, and  Dr. H. G. Harrison by no means overstates the case when he says that  the development of the heddle is the most important step in the  evolution of the loom (Horniman Museum Handbooks, No. 10, pp. 47-49).  We may now return to the drawing. Wilkinson shows the rod D1  indistinctly and the left hand end only of D2. Lepsius' artist seems  to have taken a liberty with D1 but in the right direction, by making  it more definitely into an early form of heddle--the loop and rod--but  he shows D2 the same as Cailliaud and Rosellini. Prof. Kennedy argues  that these rods are in the wrong position and that D1 which is a  heddle should be in the place of D2. Mr. Davies' drawing as well as  those of Cailliaud and Rosellini show that D1 is a heddle while D2 is  shown to be a laze rod. Asiatic primitive looms, like those from  Borneo and Bhutan, have two laze rods but no heddle; on the other hand  many primitive African looms have one laze rod and one heddle as is  the case with this Egyptian loom.

VOL. I.  SEPTEMBER, 1895.  No. 9.          PULPITS OF SOUTHERN ITALY.      The pulpits and ambos chosen for the illustrations in this issue of THE  BROCHURES are mainly interesting for their wonderful mosaic decorations  which are among the finest of their kind which have ever been executed.  The work of the family of Cosmati, by whose name the Roman mosaic or  inlay of this description is known, such as that in plate LXXI, is  similar in design and method of execution to that shown in the other  plates. There is one point, however, in which the Roman work is quite  different. In Sicily and southern Italy the bands and borders of  geometrical patterns are largely made up of glass or composition, while  the Cosmati confined themselves to the use of colored marbles. In the  south, and particularly in Sicily, gold is freely used, but this is  lacking in the work of the Cosmati. As a result of this difference in  material a wider range of color is possible in the southern mosaics than  in those of Rome; and this is especially noticeable in the use of blues,  which give much of the character to the beautiful examples shown in our  plates, which we regret we cannot reproduce in color. The altar, pulpit,  and bishop's throne in the churches of SS. Nerone ed Achille and S.  Cesario in Rome may be taken as additional examples.    This is a form of decoration which may be found in many of the Byzantine  churches of the eleventh and twelfth centuries and also in the Tuscan  churches of the same epoch, notably in the Baptistery at Pisa and in the  church of San Miniato al Monte in Florence.    The mosaic floors, dados, and solid railings of the Palermitan monuments  all seem to belong to this class: a ground of gray or white marble slabs  with large panels of colored marble, mosaic bands of geometrical pattern  let into the marble, and sometimes a plain framework of one member with  a carved row of conventional leaves. In Palermo a grayish veined Greek  marble similar to that used in Venice and Ravenna was almost exclusively  used as a background. It formed a most admirable setting for the inlaid  marble mosaics which were laid in rebated panels in the marble slabs,  making a perfectly smooth surface. In the floor mosaics green serpentine  and red or purple porphyry are the usual colors besides the gray, while  brighter reds, gold, blues, white, and a variety of other glasses  (_smalti_) are employed with the serpentine and porphyry in the mosaics  on walls, pulpits, and screens.    In all of the work referred to above, the separate pieces of marble or  glass are carefully shaped to fit the patterns they are intended to  form, and in this respect differ from the Byzantine and other wall  mosaics, and from the earlier Roman mosaic pavements such as those which  are familiar in the Pompeiian buildings. In the latter the shape and  often the size of the pieces making up the pattern were of comparatively  little importance, and the pieces were imbedded in a matrix which filled  up the interstices and gave a background of neutral color.    The marble pavements, made up of discs, squares, and other geometrical  forms of colored marbles surrounded by bands or borders of a smaller  scale, were similar in design to some of the mosaics shown in our  plates. This work is known as Opus Alexandrinum and is familiar from the  pavements of St. Mark's and the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli in  Venice.         [Illustration: LXV. Ambo in the Capella Palatina, Palermo,     Sicily.]      The Capella Palatina was built and dedicated to St. Peter by King Roger  the Second of Sicily. It must have been begun soon after Roger's  coronation, and was finished in the year 1143.    It is of the same period as the cloister of Monreale, which was  described and illustrated in the March number of THE BROCHURE SERIES;  and the work here shown distinctly recalls the mosaics upon the twisted  columns in this cloister.    The interior is famous as one of the most beautiful works of color  decoration extant. Its general tone is bluish green with mosaic walls  and floor and a wooden ceiling decorated in tempera with cufic  inscriptions. It is scantily lighted with small windows, giving a rather  sombre effect. The best mosaics are in the chancel and apses.    The beautiful ambo is one of its most attractive features. The famous  candelabrum of five tiers of figures, at the projecting angle, is of  white marble.          [Illustration: LXVI. Ambo in the Cathedral, Salerno, Italy.]          [Illustration: LXVII. Pulpit in the Cathedral, Salerno, Italy.]      Salerno and Ravello were both included under the Norman rule of the  kingdom of Naples and Sicily in the eleventh century, and the work here  shown all belongs to the Norman period.    The Cathedral of Salerno was founded and dedicated to St. Matthew in  1084 by Robert Guiscard, who plundered the temples of Paestum of their  marbles and sculptures to embellish it.    The two pulpits and that in the choir in front of the archbishop's  throne, which are said to have been executed by order of John of  Procida, are fine examples of the rich mosaic work of the period. The  two large pulpits are placed in the nave, before the choir, which here  has retained its original position in front of the high altar. Stairs  opening out of the choir, finely decorated in mosaic, lead to each  pulpit. In front of the larger one on the right is a fine Paschal  candelabrum, decorated in mosaic. The pulpit itself is supported on  twelve granite columns, while the four supports of the opposite ambo are  the very rare black porphyry called _Porfido Nero-Bianco._ The raised  space between is paved in Opus Alexandrinum.          [Illustration: LXVIII. Pulpit in the Cathedral, Ravello.]      The Cathedral at Ravello, dedicated to S. Pantaleo, was founded by  Niccolo Rufolo, Duke of Sora and grand admiral under Count Roger of  Sicily.    The marble pulpit, or Gospel ambo, inlaid with mosaics, was built,  according to a Latin inscription which it bears, in the year 1272, at  the cost of Niccolo Rufolo, a descendant of the grand admiral. Another  inscription records the fact that it was the work of Nicholas, the son  of Bartolommeus of Foggia.          [Illustration: LXIX. Ambo in the Cathedral, Ravello.]      The Epistle ambo, situated on the opposite side of the church from the  main pulpit, is of earlier date than the latter. The mosaics represent  on one side Jonah being swallowed by the whale, and on the other his  being ejected. It bears the name of Costantino Rogadeo, the second  bishop of Ravello, and probably dates from about 1130.          [Illustration: LXX. Pulpit in the Church of S. Giovanni,      Ravello.]      The church of San Giovanni del Toro also dates from the time of King  Roger. The story of Jonah will be seen again depicted here.          [Illustration: LXXI. Ambo in S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura, Rome.]      The Basilica of S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura was originally only an oratory  over the Catacombs of S. Cyriaca, and was said to have been founded by  Constantine about A.D. 330. It was enlarged and partly rebuilt in the  fifth and sixth centuries, and in 1216 was again remodeled by Honorius  III, who built the present long nave and its portico, raised the  chancel, and filled up with rubbish the lower church. It is thus a grand  collection of details of various periods, but all of much interest.    Its two ambos stand on each side of the raised portion of the floor  which corresponds to the choir in the Basilica of Honorius. The Gospel  was chanted from the one on the south side with the reading desk turned  towards the choir; and the Epistle from the one on the north, with a  single desk towards the high altar. Before the Gospel ambo is a fine  mosaic candelabrum standing on a Roman cippus reversed, having an olive  branch and birds sculptured on it.    The pavement as well as the work upon these two ambos is in the style of  the Cosmati.          [Illustration: LXXII. Pulpit in the Cathedral at Messina,      Sicily.]      The Cathedral (S.M. Nuova) was founded by Count Roger in 1098, and was  finished by his son Roger. The interior is 305 feet in length, and is a  Latin cross with three aisles, separated by twenty-six columns of  Egyptian granite said to have been taken from the temple of Neptune at  Faro; they have gilt Corinthian capitals. The roof is of wood and is a  restoration by King Manfred of an ancient roof burned in 1254 at the  funeral of Conrad, son of Emperor Frederick II, the canopy over the  corpse having been so high that the lights by which it was crowned set  fire to the rafters. The three apses are filled with fine mosaics.    The pulpit of white marble is attributed to Gogini, and the font near it  to Gaddo Gaddi of Florence.           *       *       *       *       *          Competition for Advertising Design.
