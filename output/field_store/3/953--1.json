The family from which I am derived is not an ignoble one, but hath  descended all along from the priests; and as nobility among several  people is of a different origin, so with us to be of the sacerdotal  dignity, is an indication of the splendor of a family. Now, I am not  only sprung from a sacerdotal family in general, but from the first  of the twenty-four [1] courses; and as among us there is not only a  considerable difference between one family of each course and another,  I am of the chief family of that first course also; nay, further, by my  mother I am of the royal blood; for the children of Asamoneus, from whom  that family was derived, had both the office of the high priesthood, and  the dignity of a king, for a long time together. I will accordingly set  down my progenitors in order. My grandfather's father was named Simon,  with the addition of Psellus: he lived at the same time with that son  of Simon the high priest, who first of all the high priests was named  Hyrcanus. This Simon Psellus had nine sons, one of whom was Matthias,  called Ephlias: he married the daughter of Jonathan the high priest,  which Jonathan was the first of the sons of Asamoneus, who was high  priest, and was the brother of Simon the high priest also. This Matthias  had a son called Matthias Curtus, and that in the first year of the  government of Hyrcanus: his son's name was Joseph, born in the ninth  year of the reign of Alexandra: his son Matthias was born in the tenth  year of the reign of Archclaus; as was I born to Matthias in the first  year of the reign of Caius Caesar. I have three sons: Hyrcanus, the  eldest, was born in the fourth year of the reign of Vespasian, as was  Justus born in the seventh, and Agrippa in the ninth. Thus have I set  down the genealogy of my family as I have found it described [2] in the  public records, and so bid adieu to those who calumniate me [as of a  lower original].    2. Now, my father Matthias was not only eminent on account of his  nobility, but had a higher commendation on account of his righteousness,  and was in great reputation in Jerusalem, the greatest city we have. I  was myself brought up with my brother, whose name was Matthias, for  he was my own brother, by both father and mother; and I made mighty  proficiency in the improvements of my learning, and appeared to have  both a great memory and understanding. Moreover, when I was a child, and  about fourteen years of age, I was commended by all for the love I had  to learning; on which account the high priests and principal men of the  city came then frequently to me together, in order to know my opinion  about the accurate understanding of points of the law. And when I was  about sixteen years old, I had a mind to make trim of the several sects  that were among us. These sects are three:-- The first is that of the  Pharisees, the second that Sadducees, and the third that of the Essens,  as we have frequently told you; for I thought that by this means I might  choose the best, if I were once acquainted with them all; so I contented  myself with hard fare, and underwent great difficulties, and went  through them all. Nor did I content myself with these trials only; but  when I was informed that one, whose name was Banus, lived in the desert,  and used no other clothing than grew upon trees, and had no other food  than what grew of its own accord, and bathed himself in cold water  frequently, both by night and by day, in order to preserve his chastity,  I imitated him in those things, and continued with him three years.  [3] So when I had accomplished my desires, I returned back to the city,  being now nineteen years old, and began to conduct myself according to  the rules of the sect of the Pharisees, which is of kin to the sect of  the Stoics, as the Greeks call them.    3. But when I was in the twenty-sixth year of my age, it happened that  I took a voyage to Rome, and this on the occasion which I shall now  describe. At the time when Felix was procurator of Judea there were  certain priests of my acquaintance, and very excellent persons they  were, whom on a small and trifling occasion he had put into bonds, and  sent to Rome to plead their cause before Caesar. These I was desirous to  procure deliverance for, and that especially because I was informed  that they were not unmindful of piety towards God, even under  their afflictions, but supported themselves with figs and nuts. [4]  Accordingly I came to Rome, though it were through a great number of  hazards by sea; for as our ship was drowned in the Adriatic Sea, we that  were in it, being about six hundred in number, [5] swam for our lives  all the night; when, upon the first appearance of the day, and upon our  sight of a ship of Cyrene, I and some others, eighty in all, by God's  providence, prevented the rest, and were taken up into the other ship.  And when I had thus escaped, and was come to Dieearchia, which the  Italians call Puteoli, I became acquainted with Aliturius, an actor of  plays, and much beloved by Nero, but a Jew by birth; and through his  interest became known to Poppea, Caesar's wife, and took care, as soon  as possible, to entreat her to procure that the priests might be set at  liberty. And when, besides this favor, I had obtained many presents from  Poppea, I returned home again.    4. And now I perceived innovations were already begun, and that there  were a great many very much elevated in hopes of a revolt from the  Romans. I therefore endeavored to put a stop to these tumultuous  persons, and persuaded them to change their minds; and laid before their  eyes against whom it was that they were going to fight, and told them  that they were inferior to the Romans not only in martial skill, but  also in good fortune; and desired them not rashly, and after the most  foolish manner, to bring on the dangers of the most terrible mischiefs  upon their country, upon their families, and upon themselves. And this I  said with vehement exhortation, because I foresaw that the end of such a  war would be most unfortunate to us. But I could not persuade them; for  the madness of desperate men was quite too hard for me.    5. I was then afraid, lest, by inculcating these things so often, I  should incur their hatred and their suspicions, as if I were of our  enemies' party, and should run into the danger of being seized by them,  and slain; since they were already possessed of Antonia, which was the  citadel; so I retired into the inner court of the temple. Yet did I go  out of the temple again, after Manahem and the principal of the band of  robbers were put to death, when I abode among the high priests and the  chief of the Pharisees. But no small fear seized upon us when we saw the  people in arms, while we ourselves knew not what we should do, and were  not able to restrain the seditious. However, as the danger was directly  upon us, we pretended that we were of the same opinion with them, but  only advised them to be quiet for the present, and to let the enemy go  away, still hoping that Gessius [Florus] would not be long ere he  came, and that with great forces, and so put an end to these seditious  proceedings.    6. But, upon his coming and fighting, he was beaten, and a great many  of those that were with him fell. And this disgrace which Gessius [with  Cestius] received, became the calamity of our whole nation; for those  that were fond of the war were so far elevated with this success, that  they had hopes of finally conquering the Romans. Of which war another  occasion was ministered; which was this:-- Those that dwelt in the  neighboring cities of Syria seized upon such Jews as dwelt among them,  with their wives and children, and slew them, when they had not the  least occasion of complaint against them; for they did neither attempt  any innovation or revolt from the Romans, nor had they given any marks  of hatred or treacherous designs towards the Syrians. But what was done  by the inhabitants of Scythopolis was the most impious and most highly  criminal of all; [6] for when the Jews their enemies came upon them from  without, they forced the Jews that were among them to bear arms against  their own countrymen, which it is unlawful for us to do; [7] and when,  by their assistance, they had joined battle with those who attacked  them, and had beaten them, after that victory they forgot the assurances  they had given these their fellow citizens and confederates, and slew  them all, being in number many ten thousands [13,000]. The like miseries  were undergone by those Jews that were the inhabitants of Damascus. But  we have given a more accurate account of these things in the books of  the Jewish war. I only mention them now, because I would demonstrate to  my readers, that the Jews' war with the Romans was not voluntary, but  that, for the main, they were forced by necessity to enter into it.    7. So when Gessius had been beaten, as we have said already, the  principal men of Jerusalem, seeing that the robbers and innovators had  arms in great plenty, and fearing lest they, while they were unprovided  of arms, should be in subjection to their enemies, which also came to  be the case afterward; and, being informed that all Galilee had not yet  revolted from the Romans, but that some part of it was still quiet;  they sent me and two others of the priests, who were men of excellent  characters, Joazar and Judas, in order to persuade the ill men there to  lay down their arms, and to teach them this lesson,--That it were better  to have those arms reserved for the most courageous men that the nation  had [than to be kept there]; for that it had been resolved, That those  our best men should always have their arms ready against futurity; but  still so, that they should wait to see what the Romans would do.    8.
