PREFACE.      This book is descriptive of things as they are in a part of New Zealand,  together with some reference to past history. It does not attempt to  handle the colony as a whole, but refers to scenes within the northern  half of the North Island only. This part of the country, the natural  home of the kauri pine, is what I here intend to specify under the title  of Northern New Zealand.    I am not an emigration-tout, a land-salesman, or a tourist. When I went  to New Zealand I went there as an emigrant. Not until a few days before  I left its shores had I any other idea but that the rest of my life was  destined to be that of a colonist, and that New Zealand was my fixed and  permanent home. I have, therefore, written from the point of view of a  settler. Circumstances, which have nothing to do with this chronicle,  caused me to lay down axe and spade, and eventually to become a  spoiler of paper instead of a bushman. The materials of this work,  gathered together in the previous condition of life, are now put in  print in the other.    I trust no one of my colonial friends will feel offended, should he  think that he discovers a caricature of himself in these pages. I have  used disguises to veil real identities, occasionally taking liberties as  regards time, situation, and personality. I think that no one but  themselves could recognize my characters.    The substance of one or two chapters of this book has, in part, been  already placed before the public in papers that I contributed to _The  Field_ last year, and is used again here by kind permission of the  proprietor of that newspaper. Also, I have made the Kaipara the scene of  several tales and sketches, which have appeared in sundry periodicals.    If, in writing this book, I had any object beyond that of amusing the  reader, it has been to give accurate information to young Englishmen  belonging to the middle-classes. From this section of home society a  considerable number of emigrants go out who had much better stop at  home. On the other hand, there are many who do not stir, and who would  be much better off in a colony. Perhaps, from the record I am now able  to put before them, some of these young gentlemen will be more able to  decide whether they are personally adapted to become colonists in  Northern New Zealand or not. If one unsuitable emigrant is hereby  deterred from leaving home, and if one capable colonist is added to the  population of \"Brighter Britain,\" my labour will not have been  altogether useless.    For the rest, I throw myself again upon the indulgence of critics, and  on that of a public which has already abundantly favoured the efforts I  have made to please and serve it.

Three months on board ship seems a long while to look forward to, yet it  is but a short time to look back upon. Emigrants, being for the most  part drawn from among dry-land-living populations, are apt to be daunted  by the idea of a long voyage. People would be more ready, perhaps, to  contemplate becoming colonists, were it not for that dreaded crossing of  the sea which must necessarily be their first step. Their terrors may be  natural enough, but they are more fanciful than real; and once overcome,  the emigrant smiles at his former self.    After the first week or two at sea, the most inveterate \"land-lubber\"  begins to feel at home; in another week or two he has become quite  nautical, and imagines himself to have been a sailor half his life;  while, when the voyage is over and the time come to go ashore, there are  few who leave their floating home without regret.    As things are managed nowadays, there exists no reason for apprehension  of the voyage on the part of would-be colonists. Emigrants who are taken  out \"free\"--that is, at the expense of the colonial government--as well  as those who pay their own passage, are cared for in most liberal and  considerate style. The rivalry between the various colonies of Australia  has had this effect among others--that the voyage is made as safe,  smooth, and inviting to emigrants as is possible. They are berthed with  an ever-increasing attention to their care and comfort, while they are  absolutely pampered and fattened with abundance and variety of the best  food.    No one expects to commence life in a new country without undergoing some  amount of hardship and difficulty, and when the emigrant gets on shore,  and begins to experience the various little annoyances that a \"new-chum\"  must necessarily undergo, he realizes most thoroughly the pleasures and  comforts he has left behind him on board ship; and, very frequently,  vainly endeavours to suppress the wish that he was back on board \"the  old hooker\" making the voyage out over again.    As to _danger_, nothing amuses an old salt more than the bare idea of  the \"perils of the sea.\" To him, a railway journey, short or long,  appears an infinitely more terrible and risky undertaking than a voyage  half round the globe; and he will enumerate the various dangers to which  a landsman is exposed as vastly in excess of those which may happen to  the mariner.    Life on board an emigrant-ship would, it might be thought, be somewhat  dull and monotonous. As a matter of fact, it is scarcely ever found to  be so. First of all, the little community of two or three hundred  souls--men, women, and children--contrives to find sufficient fund for  amusement in itself, in all the varieties of social intercourse.    The progress of each day is marked by some fresh events that,  insignificant as they may seem when regarded from a distance, do yet  bear the strongest interest to all on board. A glimpse at some distant  land, the signalling or speaking of other vessels, the appearance of  strange birds and fish, the passage into different climates, the  excitement of a storm, or the opportunity which a calm gives for general  junketing; all such incidents are looked upon as a real gain by the  voyagers, while there is always something stirring on board to divert  and enliven them.    All kinds of games are resorted to, many more, in fact, than landsmen  have any idea of; a vast amount of reading is done; there are sure to be  one or two on board who know how to spin a yarn with due effect; some  are musical, and others can sing. Concerts, lectures, theatricals, and  dances are got up; while, as there is generally a due admixture of the  sexes, not a little flirting and downright courting is carried on; and,  lastly, if there is any quarrelling and bickering, the differences of  those who engage in it afford much amusement to the rest.    Altogether, the modern emigrant's existence on board ship is a calm,  easy, indolent, well-fed, and cheerful interlude of repose, amid the  storms and worries of the great battle of life. If existence has been to  him hitherto rather hard and thorny than otherwise, he finds the voyage  out a pleasant interval of rest and refreshment; and, in any case, it  recruits and prepares him to better commence the new life in the colony,  with good spirits and high hopes, with invigorated strength, and renewed  health in both mind and body.    Although it might be thought that social equality would necessarily  prevail on board ship, such is by no means the case. Of course there are  great differences in the social tone of various ships, but, as a rule,  \"aft\" seldom condescends to mix much with \"forrard.\" Yet there are  generally many interchanges of courtesy, as between upper, middle, and  lower classes; and different messes will sometimes banquet one another.  The \"cuddy\" will, perhaps, get up amateur theatricals or charades, to  which spectacle the whole vessel will be invited; while the \"steerage\"  will return the compliment with a concert, more or less brilliant in  performance.    Thus, a pleasant interchange of civilities goes on aboard most ships,  and serves to help make the time pass away. Differences of rank and  station are supposed to be pretty well levelled down in the colonies.  Most of the time-worn prejudices of the old country, it is true,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

NOTHING is more obvious, than that experience purchased by the sacrifice  of independence is bought at too dear a rate. Yet this is the only  consolation which remains to many females, while sitting on the ashes of  a ruined fortune, and piercing themselves with the recollection of the  numerous imprudencies into which they have been led, simply for the want  of better information. Not because there is any want of valuable  publications, for in the present age they abound; but rather because  they contain such a variety of superfluous articles, and are too  indiscriminate to become generally useful. A young female, just returned  from the hymeneal altar, is ready to exclaim on the first perusal, as  the philosopher did who visited the metropolis, 'How many things are  here which I do not want!' The volume when purchased is often found to  contain what is only or chiefly adapted to those who live in \"king's  houses,\" or \"who fare sumptuously every day.\"    Indeed, it has been the failing of most works of this nature, that they  have either been too contracted, or too diffuse; detailed what was  unnecessary, or treated superficially what was in fact of most  consequence to the great bulk of mankind. If it be objected to the  present work, that it exhibits nothing new; that the experiments are  founded upon the simplest rules of nature; that most of the things have  been rehearsed in various forms; it is not necessary to deny or to  conceal the fact, every other consideration having been subordinated to  one leading object, and that is GENERAL UTILITY. It is but justice  however to add, that many of the articles are perfectly ORIGINAL, having  been extracted from a variety of unpublished manuscripts, obligingly and  expressly furnished in aid of the present undertaking. A great number of  outlandish articles are intentionally omitted, as well as a farrago of  French trifles and French nonsense, in order to render the work truly  worthy of the patronage of the genuine English housekeeper.    It may also fairly be presumed, that the superior advantages of the  present work will immediately be recognized, not only as comprehending  at once the whole theory of Domestic Management, but in a form never  before attempted, and which of all others is best adapted to facilitate  the acquisition of useful knowledge. The alphabetical arrangement  presented in the following sheets, pointing out at once the article  necessary to be consulted, prevents the drudgery of going through  several pages in order to find it, and supplies by its convenience and  universal adaptation, the desideratum so long needed in this species of  composition.      _Importance of Domestic Habits and Acquirements._    Though domestic occupations do not stand so high in the general esteem  as they formerly did, there are none of greater importance in social  life, and none when neglected that produce a larger portion of human  misery. There was a time when ladies knew nothing beyond their own  family concerns; but in the present day there are many who know nothing  about them. If a young person has been sent to a fashionable  boarding-school, it is ten to one, when she returns home, whether she  can mend her own stockings, or boil a piece of meat, or do any thing  more than preside over the flippant ceremonies of the tea-table. Each  extreme ought to be avoided, and care taken to unite in the female  character, the cultivation of talents and habits of usefulness. In every  department those are entitled to the greatest praise, who best acquit  themselves of the duties which their station requires, and this it is  that gives true dignity to character. Happily indeed there are still  great numbers in every situation, whose example combines in a high  degree the ornamental with the useful. Instances may be found of ladies  in the higher walks of life, who condescend to examine the accounts of  their servants and housekeepers; and by overseeing and wisely directing  the expenditure of that part of their husband's income which falls under  their own inspection, avoid the inconveniences of embarrassed  circumstances. How much more necessary then is domestic knowledge in  those whose limited fortunes press on their attention considerations of  the strictest economy. There ought to be a material difference in the  degree of care which a person of a large and independent estate bestows  on money concerns, and that of one in inferior circumstances: yet both  may very commendably employ some portion of their time and thoughts on  this subject. The custom of the times tends in some measure to abolish  the distinctions in rank, the education given to young people being  nearly the same in all. But though the leisure of the higher sort may  very well be devoted to different accomplishments, the pursuits of those  in a middle sphere, if less ornamental, would better secure their own  happiness, and that of others connected with them. We sometimes bring up  children in a manner calculated rather to fit them for the station we  wish, than that which it is likely they will actually possess; and it is  in all cases worth the while of parents to consider whether the  expectation or hope of raising their offspring above their own situation  be well founded. There is no opportunity of attaining a knowledge of  family management at school, certainly; and during vacations, all  subjects that might interfere with amusement are avoided. The  consequence is, when a girl in the higher ranks returns home after  completing her education, her introduction to the gay world, and a  continued course of pleasures, persuade her at once that she was born to  be the ornament of fashionable circles, rather than descend to the  management of family concerns, though by that means she might in various  ways increase the comfort and satisfaction of her parents. On the other  hand, persons of an inferior sphere, and especially in the lower order  of middling life, are almost always anxious to give their children such  advantages of education as they themselves did not possess. Whether  their indulgence be productive of the happiness so kindly aimed at, must  be judged by the effects, which are not very favourable if what has been  taught has not produced humility in herself, and increased gratitude and  respect to her parents. Were a young woman brought to relish home  society, and the calm delights of an easy and agreeable occupation,  before she entered into the delusive scenes of pleasure, presented by  the theatre and other dissipations, it is probable she would soon make a  comparison much in favour of the former, especially if restraint did  not give to the latter an additional relish.    If our observations were extended to the marriage state, we should find  a life of employment to be the source of unnumbered pleasures. To attend  to the nursing, and at least the early instruction of children, and rear  a healthy progeny in the ways of piety and usefulness; to preside over  the family, and regulate the income allotted to its maintenance; to make  home the agreeable retreat of a husband, fatigued by intercourse with a  bustling world; to be his enlightened companion, and the chosen friend  of his heart; these, these are woman's duties, and her highest honour.  And when it is thus evident that high intellectual attainments may find  room for their exercise in the multifarious occupations of the daughter,  the wife, the mother, the mistress of the house; no one can reasonably  urge that the female mind is contracted by domestic employ. It is  however a great comfort that the duties of life are within the reach of  humbler abilities, and that she whose chief aim it is to fulfil them,  will very rarely fail to acquit herself well.      _Domestic Expenditure._    The mistress of a family should always remember, that the welfare and  good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior; and  consequently that"]]]
