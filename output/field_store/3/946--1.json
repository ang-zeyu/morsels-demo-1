CHRISTMAS TALES.          A CHRISTMAS CAROL.    BY CHARLES DICKENS.      STAVE ONE.    MARLEY'S GHOST.      Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the  undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name  was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.    Old Marley was dead as a door-nail.    Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?  Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge  was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole  residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge  was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an  excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized  it with an undoubted bargain.    The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started  from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly  understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to  relate.    Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years  afterward, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was  known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called  Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It  was all the same to him.    Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a  squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old  sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out  generous fire; secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The  cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,  shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin  lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime on  his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin.    External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could  warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than  he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain  less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The  heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the  advantage over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"  handsomely, and Scrooge never did.    Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My  dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\" No beggars  implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was  o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to  such and such a place, of Scrooge.    But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his  way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep  its distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.    Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas  Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,  biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court  outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their  breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.  The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark  already--it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the  windows of the neighboring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable  brown air.    The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his  eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,  was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire  was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't  replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so  surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that  it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his  white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which  effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.    \"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a cheerful voice. It was  the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this  was the first intimation he had of his approach.    \"Bah!\" said Scrooge. \"Humbug!\"    He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this  nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and  handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.    \"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"You don't mean  that, I am sure?\"    \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be  merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.\"    \"Come then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What right have you to be  dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.\"    Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,  \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up with, \"Keep Christmas in your own way,  and let me keep it in mine.\"    \"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you don't keep it.\"    \"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much good may it do you!  Much good it has ever done you!\"    \"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I  have not profited, I dare say,\" returned the nephew, \"Christmas among  the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it  has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and  origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good  time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know  of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one  consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people  below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and  not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,  uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I  believe that it _has_ done me good, and _will_ do me good; and I say,  God bless it!\"    The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately  sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the  last frail spark for ever.    \"Let me hear another sound from _you_,\" said Scrooge, \"and you'll keep  your Christmas by losing your situation. You're quite a powerful  speaker, sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you don't go  into Parliament.\"    \"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"    Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he did. He went the  whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that  extremity first.    \"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew, \"Why?\"    \"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.    \"Because I fell in love.\"    \"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only  one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \"Good  afternoon!\"    \"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give  it as a reason for not coming now?\"    \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.    \"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be  friends?\"    \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.    \"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never  had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial  in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So  a Merry Christmas, uncle!\"    \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.    \"And a Happy New Year!\"    \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.    His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He  stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the  clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned  them cordially.    \"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: \"my  clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#1)"],[1,"was produced from scanned images of public domain  material from the Google Print project.)                    Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and  Energy Transformations of Man    BY    FRANCIS G. BENEDICT and THORNE M. CARPENTER      [Illustration]    WASHINGTON, D. C.  PUBLISHED BY THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON  1910      CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON  PUBLICATION NO. 123      The Lord Baltimore Press  BALTIMORE, MD., U. S. A.          PREFACE.      The immediate development and construction of suitable apparatus for  studying the complicated processes of metabolism in man was obviously  the first task in equipping the Nutrition Laboratory. As several series  of experiments have already been made with these respiration  calorimeters, it is deemed advisable to publish the description of the  apparatus as used at present. New features in the apparatus are,  however, frequently introduced as opportunity to increase accuracy or  facilitate manipulation is noted.    We wish here to express our sense of obligation to the following  associates: Mr. W. E. Collins, mechanician of the Nutrition Laboratory,  constructed the structural steel framework and contributed many  mechanical features to the apparatus as a whole; Mr. J. A. Riche,  formerly associated with the researches in nutrition in the chemical  laboratory of Wesleyan University, added his previous experience in  constructing and installing the more delicate of the heating and cooling  devices. Others who have aided in the painstaking construction, testing,  and experimenting with the apparatus are Messrs. W. H. Leslie, L. E.  Emmes, F. L. Dorn, C. F. Clark, F. A. Renshaw, H. A. Stevens, Jr., Miss  H. Sherman, and Miss A. Johnson.    The numerous drawings were made by Mr. E. H. Metcalf, of our staff.
