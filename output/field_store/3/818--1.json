There was no sound from the  waste except the wind among the withered reeds and the furrowing splash  of wheel and hoof over the submerged causeway.    The boy who was driving had scarcely spoken since he strapped Marche's  gun cases and valise to the rear of the rickety wagon at the railroad  station. Marche, too, remained silent, preoccupied with his own  reflections. Wrapped in his fur-lined coat, arms folded, he sat doubled  forward, feeling the Southern swamp-chill busy with his bones. Now and  then he was obliged to relight his pipe, but the cold bit at his  fingers, and he hurried to protect himself again with heavy gloves.    The small, rough hands of the boy who was driving were naked, and  finally Marche mentioned it, asking the child if he were not cold.    \"No, sir,\" he said, with a colorless brevity that might have been  shyness or merely the dull indifference of the very poor, accustomed to  discomfort.    \"Don't you feel cold at all?\" persisted Marche kindly.    \"No, sir.\"    \"I suppose you are hardened to this sort of weather?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    By the light of a flaming match, Marche glanced sideways at him as he  drew his pipe into a glow once more, and for an instant the boy's gray  eyes flickered toward his in the flaring light. Then darkness masked  them both again.    \"Are you Mr. Herold's son?\" inquired the young man.    \"Yes, sir,\" almost sullenly.    \"How old are you?\"    \"Eleven.\"    \"You're a big boy, all right. I have never seen your father. He is at  the clubhouse, no doubt.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" scarcely audible.    \"And you and he live there all alone, I suppose?\"    \"Yes, sir.\" A moment later the boy added jerkily, \"And my sister,\" as  though truth had given him a sudden nudge.    \"Oh, you have a sister, too?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"That makes it very jolly for you, I fancy,\" said Marche pleasantly.  There was no reply to the indirect question.    His pipe had gone out again, and he knocked the ashes from it and  pocketed it. For a while they drove on in silence, then Marche peered  impatiently through the darkness, right and left, in an effort to see;  and gave it up.    \"You must know this road pretty well to be able to keep it,\" he said.  \"As for me, I can't see anything except a dirty little gray star up  aloft.\"    \"The horse knows the road.\"    \"I'm glad of that. Have you any idea how near we are to the house?\"    \"Half a mile. That's Rattler Creek, yonder.\"    \"How the dickens can you tell?\" asked Marche curiously. \"You can't see  anything in the dark, can you?\"    \"I don't know how I can tell,\" said the boy indifferently.    Marche smiled. \"A sixth sense, probably. What did you say your name is?\"    \"Jim.\"    \"And you're eleven? You'll be old enough to have a gun very soon, Jim.  How would you like to shoot a real, live wild duck?\"    \"I _have_ shot plenty.\"    Marche laughed. \"Good for you, Jimmy. What did the gun do to you? Kick  you flat on your back?\"    The boy said gravely: \"Father's gun is too big for me. I have to rest it  on the edge of the blind when I fire.\"    \"Do you shoot from the blinds?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Marche relapsed into smiling silence. In a few moments he was thinking  of other things--of this muddy island which had once been the property  of a club consisting of five carefully selected and wealthy members, and  which, through death and resignation, had now reverted to him. Why he  had ever bought in the shares, as one by one the other members either  died or dropped out, he did not exactly know. He didn't care very much  for duck shooting. In five years he had not visited the club; and why he  had come here this year for a week's sport he scarcely knew, except that  he had either to go somewhere for a rest or ultimately be carried,  kicking, into what his slangy doctor called the \"funny house.\"    So here he was, on a cold February night, and already nearly at his  destination; for now he could make out a light across the marsh, and  from dark and infinite distances the east wind bore the solemn rumor of  the sea, muttering of wrecks and death along the Atlantic sands beyond  the inland sounds.    \"Well, Jim,\" he said, \"I never thought I'd survive this drive, but here  we are, and still alive. Are you frozen solid, you poor boy?\"    The boy smiled, shyly, in negation, as they drove into the bar of light  from the kitchen window and stopped. Marche got down very stiffly. The  kitchen door opened at the same moment, and a woman's figure appeared in  the lamplight--a young girl, slender, bare armed, drying her fingers as  she came down the steps to offer a small, weather-roughened hand to  Marche.    \"My brother will show you to your room,\" she said. \"Supper will be ready  in a few minutes.\"    So he thanked her and went away with Jim, relieving the boy of the  valise and one gun-case, and presently came to the quarters prepared for  him. The room was rough, with its unceiled walls of yellow pine, a  chair, washstand, bed, and a nail or two for his wardrobe. It had been  the affectation of the wealthy men composing the Foam Island Duck Club  to exist almost primitively when on the business of duck shooting, in  contradistinction to the overfed luxury of other millionaires  inhabiting other more luxuriously appointed shooting-boxes along the  Chesapeake.    The Foam Island Club went in heavily for simplicity, as far as the  two-story shanty of a clubhouse was concerned; but their island was one  of the most desirable in the entire region, and their live decoys the  most perfectly trained and cared for.    Marche, washing his tingling fingers and visage in icy water, rather  wished, for a moment, that the club had installed modern plumbing; but  delectable odors from the kitchen put him into better humor, and  presently he went off down the creaking and unpainted stairs to warm  himself at a big stove until summoned to the table.    He was summoned in a few moments by the same girl who had greeted him;  and she also waited on him at table, placing before him in turn his  steaming soup, a platter of fried bass and smoking sweet potatoes, then  the inevitable broiled canvas-back duck with rice, and finally home-made  preserves--wild grapes, exquisitely fragrant in their thin, golden  syrup.    Marche was that kind of a friendly young man who is naturally  gay-hearted and also a little curious--sometimes to the verge of  indiscretion. For his curiosity and inquiring interest in his fellow-men  was easily aroused--particularly when they were less fortunately  situated than he in a world where it is a favorite fiction that all are  created equal. He was, in fact, that particular species of human  nuisance known as a humanitarian; but he never dreamed he was a  nuisance, and certainly never meant to be.    Warmth and food and the prospects of to-morrow's shooting, and a  slender, low-voiced young girl, made cheerful his recently frost-nipped  soul, and he was inclined to expand and become talkative there in the  lamplight.    \"Has the shooting been pretty good?\" he asked pleasantly, plying knife  and fork in the service of a raging appetite.
