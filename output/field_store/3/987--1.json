PREFACE      AMERICAN RURAL HIGHWAYS was written for use as a text or reference in  courses dealing with rural highways and intended for agricultural  engineers, students in agriculture and for short courses and extension  courses. The reader is assumed to have familiarity with drawing and  surveying, but the text is adapted primarily for students who do not  receive training along the lines of the usual course in Highway or  Civil Engineering.    The text is intended to familiarize the student with the relation of  highway improvement to national progress, to indicate the various  problems of highway administration and to set forth the usual methods  of design and construction for rural highways in sufficient detail to  establish a clear understanding of the distinguishing characteristics  and relative serviceability of each of the common types of roadway  surface.    Experience with classes made up of students in agriculture or  agricultural engineering and with trade school students in road making  served as a guide in the selection and arrangement of the material.  Detailed discussion of tests of materials and of the theory of design  has to a considerable extent been eliminated as being outside of the  scope of the course for which the text is intended.    In the preparation of American Rural Highways reference was had to  many books on highway subjects and to current periodical literature.  Wherever direct extracts were made from such source, appropriate  acknowledgment appears in the text.                                                 T. R.

The degree to which a nation or a community perfects its  transportation facilities is an index of its industrial progress and  public highways constitute an important element in the national  transportation system. It is to be expected that the average citizen  will think of the public highway only when it affects his own  activities and that he will concern himself but little with the broad  problem of highway improvement unless it be brought forcibly to his  attention through taxation or by publicity connected with the  advancement of specific projects.    =National in Scope.=--The improvement and extension of the highway  system is of national importance just as is development and extension  of railways, and concerted action throughout a nation is a  prerequisite to an adequate policy in regard to either. It is  inconceivable that any community in a nation can prosper greatly  without some benefit accruing to many other parts of the country.  Increased consumption, which always accompanies material prosperity,  means increased production somewhere, and people purchase from many  varied sources to supply the things that they want. Good  transportation facilities contribute greatly to community prosperity  and indirectly to national prosperity, and the benefits of highly  improved public highways are therefore national in scope. This fact  has been recognized in Europe, notably in England, France and Belgium,  where the public highways are administered largely as national  utilities.    Until recent years, highway improvement in the United States has been  subordinated to other more pressing public improvements, but during  the World War the inadequacy of the transportation system of the  United States became apparent. While such an unprecedented load upon  transportation facilities may not recur for many years, it has become  apparent that more rapid progress in highway improvement is necessary  and in the United States the subject is now likely to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29444"],[0,"The Machinery of the Universe: Mechanical Conceptions of Physical Phenomena (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive)                    _THE ROMANCE OF SCIENCE_      THE MACHINERY OF THE UNIVERSE    MECHANICAL CONCEPTIONS OF  PHYSICAL PHENOMENA      BY  A.

LONDON:  SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE,  NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE, W.C.;  43, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, E.C.    BRIGHTON: 129, NORTH STREET.    NEW YORK: E. & J. B. YOUNG & CO.    1897.          PREFACE      For thirty years or more the expressions \"Correlation of the Physical  Forces\" and \"The Conservation of Energy\" have been common, yet few  persons have taken the necessary pains to think out clearly what  mechanical changes take place when one form of energy is transformed  into another.    Since Tyndall gave us his book called _Heat as a Mode of Motion_ neither  lecturers nor text-books have attempted to explain how all phenomena are  the necessary outcome of the various forms of motion. In general,  phenomena have been attributed to _forces_--a metaphysical term, which  explains nothing and is merely a stop-gap, and is really not at all  needful in these days, seeing that transformable modes of motion, easily  perceived and understood, may be substituted in all cases for forces.    In December 1895 the author gave a lecture before the Franklin Institute  of Philadelphia, on \"Mechanical Conceptions of Electrical Phenomena,\" in  which he undertook to make clear what happens when electrical phenomena  appear. The publication of this lecture in _The Journal of the Franklin  Institute_ and in _Nature_ brought an urgent request that it should be  enlarged somewhat and published in a form more convenient for the  public. The enlargement consists in the addition of a chapter on the  \"_Contrasted Properties of Matter and the Ether_,\" a chapter containing  something which the author believes to be of philosophical importance in  these days when electricity is so generally described as a phenomenon of  the ether.

'And now we might add something concerning a most subtle spirit      which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies, by the force      and action of which spirit the particles of bodies attract      each other at near distances, and cohere if contiguous, and      electric bodies operate at greater distances, as well repelling      as attracting neighbouring corpuscles, and light is emitted,      reflected, inflected, and heats bodies, and all sensation is      excited, and members of animal bodies move at the command of      the will.'--NEWTON, _Principia_.      In Newton's day the whole field of nature was practically lying fallow.  No fundamental principles were known until the law of gravitation was  discovered. This law was behind all the work of Copernicus, Kepler, and  Galileo, and what they had done needed interpretation. It was quite  natural that the most obvious and mechanical phenomena should first be  reduced, and so the _Principia_ was concerned with mechanical principles  applied to astronomical problems. To us, who have grown up familiar with  the principles and conceptions underlying them, all varieties of  mechanical phenomena seem so obvious, that it is difficult for us to  understand how any one could be obtuse to them; but the records of  Newton's time, and immediately after this, show that they were not so  easy of apprehension. It may be remembered that they were not adopted in  France till long after Newton's day. In spite of what is thought to be  reasonable, it really requires something more than complete  demonstration to convince most of us of the truth of an idea, should the  truth happen to be of a kind not familiar, or should it chance to be  opposed to our more or less well-defined notions of what it is or ought  to be. If those who labour for and attain what they think to be the  truth about any matter, were a little better informed concerning mental  processes and the conditions under which ideas grow and displace others,  they would be more patient with mankind; teachers of every rank might  then discover that what is often called stupidity may be nothing else  than mental inertia, which can no more be made active by simply willing  than can the movement of a cannon ball by a like effort. We _grow_ into  our beliefs and opinions upon all matters, and scientific ideas are no  exceptions.    Whewell, in his _History of the Inductive Sciences_, says that the  Greeks made no headway in physical science because they lacked  appropriate ideas. The evidence is overwhelming that they were as  observing, as acute, as reasonable as any who live to-day. With this  view, it would appear that the great discoverers must have been men who  started out with appropriate ideas: were looking for what they found.  If, then, one reflects upon the exceeding great difficulty there is in  discovering one new truth, and the immense amount of work needed to  disentangle it, it would appear as if even the most successful have but  indistinct ideas of what is really appropriate, and that their  mechanical conceptions become clarified by doing their work. This is not  always the fact. In the statement of Newton quoted at the head of this  chapter, he speaks of a spirit which lies hid in all gross bodies, etc.,  by means of which all kinds of phenomena are to be explained; but he  deliberately abandons that idea when he comes to the study of light, for  he assumes the existence and activity of light corpuscles, for which he  has no experimental evidence; and the probability is that he did this  because the latter conception was one which he could handle  mathematically, while he saw no way for thus dealing with the other. His  mechanical instincts were more to be trusted than his carefully  calculated results; for, as all know, what he called \"spirits,\" is what  to-day we call the ether, and the corpuscular theory of light has now no  more than a historic interest. The corpuscular theory was a mechanical  conception, but each such corpuscle was ideally endowed with qualities  which were out of all relation with the ordinary matter with which it  was classed.    Until the middle of the present century the reigning physical philosophy  held to the existence of what were called imponderables. The phenomena  of heat were explained as due to an imponderable substance called  \"caloric,\" which ordinary matter could absorb and emit. A hot body was  one which had absorbed an imponderable substance. It was, therefore, no  heavier than before, but it possessed ability to do work proportional to  the amount absorbed. Carnot's ideal engine was described by him in terms  that imply the materiality of heat. Light was another imponderable  substance, the existence of which was maintained by Sir David Brewster  as long as he lived. Electricity and magnetism were imponderable fluids,  which, when allied with ordinary matter, endowed the latter with their  peculiar qualities. The conceptions in each case were properly  mechanical ones _part_ (but not all) _of the time_; for when the  immaterial substances were dissociated from matter, where they had  manifested themselves, no one concerned himself to inquire as to their  whereabouts. They were simply off duty, but could be summoned, like the  genii in the story of Aladdin's Lamp. Now, a mechanical conception of  any phenomenon, or a mechanical explanation of any kind of action, must  be mechanical all the time, in the antecedents as well as the  consequents. Nothing else will do except a miracle.    During the fifty years, from about 1820 to 1870, a somewhat different  kind of"]]]
