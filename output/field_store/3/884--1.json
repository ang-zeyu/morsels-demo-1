Years ago a country boy heard or read that if a simple box having a  hole of a certain size were set upon a post in March or early April it  would not be long before bluebirds would be around to see if the place  would do as a summer cottage. So he took an old paint keg such as  white lead is sold in, nailed a cover across the top, cut an opening  in the side and then placed it on a post ten or twelve feet high. Only  a day or two passed before a soft call-note was heard, a flash of  blue, and the songster had arrived. His mate came a few days later and  the paint keg with its tenants became the center of interest in my  life. A second brood was reared in midsummer and when the cool days of  September came a fine flock left for the South. Each year the house  was occupied until the post decayed and the paint keg fell down, but  in memory the sad call-note is still heard when spring comes, for it  is house hunting time once more, and the bluebirds are looking for the  home they had known.    That boys elsewhere may know the joy of the companionship of birds,  this little book is written. Birds will come and live near the houses  of men whenever food and water are to be had, safety from enemies is  given, and when homes are built for them to replace the shelters  nature offered before men came with their cultivated fields and  crowded cities. The following pages give pictures and drawings of  houses that boys have built and in which birds have lived. These  houses are planned for the species of birds that have become  accustomed to civilization so that they will inhabit the houses put up  for them.    The author is indebted to Professor Chas. A. Bennett of Bradley  Institute and Mr. L. L. Simpson of The Manual Arts Press for helpful  suggestions and encouragement; to John Friese for making the drawings;  and to the following for the use of the originals of the illustrations  which tell most of the story.

Certain varieties of birds will nest in homes built for them if these  houses are of the right shape and dimensions. Other birds may be just  as desirable but do not build nests and rear their young in boy-made  nesting boxes. We are therefore mainly concerned with the first group  which select cavities in trees for their homes if nothing better is to  be found.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. BLUE BIRDS, ADULTS AND YOUNG BIRD.]      BLUEBIRD.    This bird may be found during the summer months in most of the states  east of the Rocky Mountains, Figs. 1 and 59. It spends its winter in  the southern states and southward, returning north in March and April.  The principal items of food are grasshoppers, caterpillars and  beetles. It should have a house measuring about 5\" in length and  width, inside measurements, and 8\" or more in depth. The entrance hole  should be 1-1/2\" in diameter and placed near the top, so that the  young birds cannot get out until strong enough to have some chance of  escape from their enemies after they leave the nest. While authorities  differ as to the need of cleaning after a season's use, it seems wise  to provide the house with some device whereby the bottom may be  removed for such purposes. Houses for this species are shown in Figs.  11, 21, 22 and 24.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. (ROBIN)]      ROBIN.    Robins usually announce the coming of spring when they return to their  breeding grounds in the northern states, where they are general  favorites. Figs. 2 and 60. The nest is usually built of mud and lined  with grasses; placed in the fork of a tree or on some sheltered ledge.  Robins take kindly to nesting shelves put up for them and it is well  to put up several since but one brood is reared in each nest built.  This old nest should be removed after the young birds have gone. A  simple shelf is shown in the lower left hand corner of the photograph,  Fig. 24, as well as in Figs. 20 and 49.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. (CHICKADEES)]      CHICKADEE.    The chickadee is one of the brave little spirits who spends the entire  winter with us, Fig. 3. We can be of considerable service to him  during the cold weather by providing food shelters. During the summer  months his home is usually found in some decaying stump, hence  nesting boxes of the rustic type placed in some remote spot of the  orchard or park are most attractive to him.      WREN.    When all other song birds fail to take advantage of a house built for  them, the wren may still be counted on. Almost any sort of home from a  tin can or hollow gourd on up is satisfactory if put in a safe place  and provided with an opening 1\" or slightly less in diameter, so the  sparrows must stay out, Figs. 4 and 5. Good homes are shown in Figs.  10, 14, 15, 16 and others.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. WREN AND RUSTIC HOUSE.]      HOUSE FINCH.    The house finch has made many enemies because of its fondness for  cultivated fruits and berries. However, it has some redeeming  features in its song and beauty. The nest is usually placed in the  fork of a limb--evergreens being favorite nesting places. The house  shown in Fig. 51 is suitable for these birds but is also acceptable to  wrens.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. WRENS.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6. FLICKER.]      WOODPECKER.    The favorite of this interesting family is the little downy, Fig. 7.  Living largely upon harmful grubs and insects, this bird does an  immense amount of good by protecting our forests from insect scourges.  Woodpeckers do not build nests as most birds do, but excavate a deep  cavity in some dead tree leaving a quantity of chips at the bottom on  which the eggs are laid. Nesting boxes should be of the rustic type  made as shown in Fig. 12, leaving some sawdust mixed with a little  earth in the cavity. These houses should be placed on trees in a park  or orchard. Boys should be able to tell the difference between the  woodpeckers beneficial to man and the sapsucker whose misdeeds often  cause considerable damage to fruit trees. A nuthatch is also seen in  Fig. 7 enjoying a meal of sunflower seed.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. DOWNY WOODPECKER (ABOVE) NUTHATCH (BELOW).]      FLICKER.    The flickers spend much of their time on the ground in search of ants  which form the larger percentage of their food. Since ants sometimes  cause considerable trouble for other birds, a pair of flickers are  worth cultivating for the sake of the work they can do. Artificial  nesting boxes of sufficient depth and size are quite readily used,  Figs. 6, 20 and 25.      MARTIN.    Nearly everyone knows swallows of one variety or another. The most  beautiful of the family are the martins, Fig. 8. This bird is of great  service against the inroads of wasps, bugs and beetles. It prefers to  live in colonies even though the males fight bitterly at times. Martin  houses should have at least several rooms, each separate from all the  others. Houses have been built to accommodate fifty and more families.  Smaller ones are shown in Figs. 8, 9, 13 and 45.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. A MARTIN COLONY.]    [Illustration: FIG. 9. THE PEER GYNT COTTAGE FOR MARTINS.]    Fig. 9 is a miniature reproduction of Peer Gynt's cottage for a martin  house. This house was not only an attractive thing to make, but  martins selected it for their home during the past summer.          CONSTRUCTION OF BIRD HOUSES.

THE    MARTYRS OF SCIENCE,    OR    THE LIVES    OF    GALILEO, TYCHO BRAHE, AND KEPLER.      BY      SIR DAVID BREWSTER, K.H.

LONDON:    JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET.    1841.      G. S. TULLIS, PRINTER, CUPAR.            TO THE    RIGHT HON. FRANCIS LORD GRAY,    F.R.S., F.R.S.E.    MY LORD,    In submitting this volume to the public under your Lordship's auspices,  I avail myself of the opportunity thus afforded me of expressing the  deep sense which I entertain of the friendship and kindness with which  your Lordship has so long honoured me.    Although in these days, when Science constitutes the power and wealth of  nations, and encircles the domestic hearth with its most substantial  comforts, there is no risk of its votaries being either persecuted or  neglected, yet the countenance of those to whom Providence has given  rank and station will ever be one of the most powerful incitements to  scientific enterprise, as well as one of its most legitimate rewards.  Next to the satisfaction of cultivating Science, and thus laying up the  only earthly treasure which we can carry along with us into a better  state, is that of having encouraged and assisted others in the same  beneficent labours. That your Lordship may long continue to enjoy these  sources of happiness is the earnest prayer of,    MY LORD,    Your Lordship's    Most faithful and obedient servant,    DAVID BREWSTER.
