DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    Your letter of the 4th just to hand. How glad your letters make me;  how glad I am to have you to tell little things to.    I intended to write you as soon as I came back from Green River, to  tell you of a girl I saw there; but there was a heap to do and I kept  putting it off. I have described the desert so often that I am afraid  I will tire you, so I will leave that out and tell you that we arrived  in town rather late. The help at the hotel were having their supper in  the regular dining-room, as all the guests were out. They cheerfully  left their own meal to place ours on the table.    One of them interested me especially. She was a small person; I  couldn't decide whether she was a child or a woman. I kept thinking  her homely, and then when she spoke I forgot everything but the music  of her voice,--it was so restful, so rich and mellow in tone, and she  seemed so small for such a splendid voice. Somehow I kept expecting  her to squeak like a mouse, but every word she spoke charmed me.  Before the meal was over it came out that she was the dish-washer. All  the rest of the help had finished their work for the day, but she, of  course, had to wash what dishes we had been using.    The rest went their ways; and as our own tardiness had belated her, I  offered to help her to carry out the dishes. It was the work of only a  moment to dry them, so I did that. She was so small that she had to  stand on a box in order to be comfortable while she washed the cups  and plates.    \"The sink and drain-board were made for real folks. I have to use this  box to stand on, or else the water runs back down my sleeves,\" she  told me.    My room was upstairs; she helped me up with the children. She said her  name was Connie Willis, that she was the only one of her \"ma's first  man's\" children; but ma married again after pa died and there were a  lot of the second batch. When the mother died she left a baby only a  few hours old. As Connie was older than the other children she took  charge of the household and of the tiny little baby.    I just wish you could have seen her face light up when she spoke of  little Lennie.    \"Lennie is eight years old now, and she is just as smart as the  smartest and as pretty as a doll. All the Ford children are pretty,  and smart, too. I am the only homely child ma had. It would do you  good just to look at any of the rest, 'specially Lennie.\"    It certainly did me good to listen to Connie,--her brave patience was  so inspiring. As long as I was in town she came every day when her  work was finished to talk to me about Lennie. For herself she had no  ambition. Her clothes were clean, but they were odds and ends that had  served their day for other possessors; her shoes were not mates, and  one was larger than the other. She said: \"I thought it was a streak  of luck when I found the cook always wore out her right shoe first  and the dining-room girl the left, because, you see, I could have  their old ones and that would save two dollars toward what I am saving  up for. But it wasn't so very lucky after all except for the fun,  because the cook wears low heels and has a much larger foot than the  dining-room girl, who wears high heels. But I chopped the long heel  off with the cleaver, and these shoes have saved me enough to buy  Lennie a pair of patent-leather slippers to wear on the Fourth of  July.\"    I thought that a foolish ambition, but succeeding conversations made  me ashamed of the thought.    I asked her if Lennie's father couldn't take care of her.    \"Oh,\" she said, \"Pa Ford is a good man. He has a good heart, but  there's so many of them that it is all he can do to rustle what must  be had. Why,\" she told me in a burst of confidence, \"I've been saving  up for a tombstone for ma for twelve years, but I have to help pa once  in a while, and I sometimes think I never will get enough money saved.  It is kind of hard on three dollars a week, and then I'm kind of  extravagant at times. I have wanted a doll, a beautiful one, all my  days. Last Christmas I got it--for Lennie. And then I like to carry  out other folks' wishes sometimes. That is what I am fixing to do now.  Ma always wanted to see me dressed up real pretty just once, but we  were always too poor, and now I'm too old. But I can fix Lennie, and  this Fourth of July I am going to put all the beauty on her that ma  would have liked to see on me. They always celebrate that day at  Manila, Utah, where pa lives. I'll go out and take the things. Then  if ma is where she can see, she'll see _one_ of her girls dressed for  once.\"    \"But aren't you mistaken when you say you have been saving for your  mother's tombstone for twelve years? She's only been dead eight.\"    \"Why no, I'm not. You see, at first it wasn't a tombstone but a  marble-top dresser. Ma had always wanted one so badly; for she always  thought that housekeeping would be so much easier if she had just  one pretty thing to keep house toward. If I had not been so selfish,  she could have had the dresser before she died. I had fifteen  dollars,--enough to buy it,--but when I came to look in the catalogue  to choose one I found that for fifteen dollars more I could get a  whole set. I thought how proud ma would be of a new bedstead and  wash-stand, so I set in to earn that much more. But before I could get  that saved up ma just got tired of living, waiting, and doing without.  She never caused any trouble while she lived, and she died the same  way.    \"They sent for me to come home from the place where I was at work. I  had just got home, and I was standing by the bed holding ma's hand,  when she smiled up at me; she handed me Lennie and then turned over  and sighed so contented. That was all there was to it. She was done  with hard times.    \"Pa Ford wanted to buy her coffin on credit,--to go in debt for  it,--but I hated for ma to have to go on that way even after she was  dead; so I persuaded him to use what money he had to buy the coffin,  and I put in all I had, too. So the coffin she lies in is her own. We  don't owe for _that_. Then I stayed at home and kept house and cared  for Lennie until she was four years old. I have been washing dishes in  this hotel ever since.\"    That is Connie's story. After she told me, I went to the landlady and  suggested that we help a little with Lennie's finery; but she told me  to \"keep out.\" \"I doubt if Connie would accept any help from us, and  if she did, every cent we put in would take that much from her  pleasure. There have not been many happy days in her life, but the  Fourth of July will be one if we keep out.\" So I kept out.    I was delighted when Mrs. Pearson invited me to accompany her to  Manila to witness the bucking contest on the Fourth. Manila is a  pretty little town, situated in Lucerne Valley. All the houses in town  are the homes of ranchers, whose farms may be seen from any doorstep  in Manila. The valley lies between a high wall of red sandstone and  the \"hogback,\"--that is what the foothills are called. The wall of  sandstone is many miles in length. The valley presents a beautiful  picture as you go eastward; at this time of the year the alfalfa is so  green. Each farm joins another. Each has a cabin in which the rancher  lives while they irrigate and make hay. When that is finished they  move into their houses in \"town.\" Beyond the hogback rise huge  mountains, rugged canyons, and noisy mountain streams; great forests of  pine help to make up the picture. Looking toward the east we could see  where mighty Green River cuts its way through walls of granite. The  road lies close up against the sandstone and cedar hills and along the  canal that carries the water to all the farms in the valley. I enjoyed  every moment. It was all so beautiful,--the red rock, the green  fields, the warm brown sand of the road and bare places, the mighty  mountains, the rugged cedars and sage-brush spicing the warm air, the  blue distance and the fleecy clouds.

I know of no religious people who intentionally deny his agency in  creation, providence or redemption. But men differ widely in their  opinions concerning it and its relations and uses. Many honest-hearted  persons have been educated in the theory of an immediate and direct  operation of the Spirit upon the hearts of sinners in order to their  conversion, which they often call the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On this  account thousands of prayers are offered up continually to induce the Lord  to pour the Spirit upon sinners and convert and save them. And happy  meetings are attributed to wonderful outpourings of the Spirit. What is  his work? It is said that he moved upon the face of the great deep, and  that God said, Let there be light, and there was light. This operation  upon physical nature gave to our planet cosmic light, and the darkness,  which had shut out the light of the heavenly bodies through the long lapse  of time extending back from Moses' first day to the beginning in which  creation took place, was removed. Activity having begun in matter, periods  of light and darkness alternate until the conditions of our planet are so  changed that the light of the heavenly bodies becomes the light of this  world; and the great work of the Spirit having accomplished its purposes,  is classified with the extraordinary efforts of God in bringing into  existence this beautiful planetary system of ours. It is, consequently, a  work of the past. But the work of the Spirit is not over.    There must be a moral and spiritual system, as well as a physical. As the  material system would be unworthy of its creator, were it not for the fact  that it is governed by law, which is equivalent to saying, it is a system,  so the moral and spiritual must be under law, in order to the  accomplishment of the ends of its creation, which is equal to saying, it  is God's moral government. But how is this system to be brought into  existence? And how is it to be perpetuated? In answering these questions  let us remember the law of analogy, based upon the simple axiom that God  is a God of order. In the use of the analogy about to be instituted we  simply pass through the outer court of the temple of God in order to  behold the beauties of the inner. Then, as the world of matter existed as  an inactive, confused mass, surrounded by an envelope of darkness which  shut out the light of the heavens, so the human family, without the  knowledge of God, without the light of knowledge, left to its own mental  and moral wanderings, without law or system or order, would present all  the horrors of pagan darkness and woe. Then the Spirit of God must move  again in obedience to the mandate of the Most High. And as the object to  be accomplished is now connected with mind, the Spirit now moves upon the  face of the great deep of the human heart or mind. But shall he move upon  all hearts throughout all time in order to dispel moral darkness, and so  the extraordinary become the ordinary? Or shall he move in an  extraordinary manner and cause the light of revelation to flash across the  world and dispel the darkness consequent upon the mental and moral  condition of the children of men, and give us a glorious lamp of light,  along with law, order and system? And has the extraordinary given place to  the ordinary? And what is the use of the ordinary if we have the  extraordinary, or the use of the extraordinary if we have the ordinary?    As the operation of the Spirit upon the face of the great deep was to  dispel the surrounding darkness and reveal the sun in the heavens, with  all the lesser light bearers, which are dependent upon the sun for the  light they give to our planet, so the extraordinary movement of the Spirit  upon the world of mind was to give us light in the place of darkness and  reveal the Son of God, who is the \"Sun of Righteousness,\" who rose \"with  healing in his beams.\" This work of the Spirit upon the world of mind is  doubted by no Christian, for \"holy men of old spake as they were moved  upon by the Holy Spirit.\" The knowledge thus communicated was given to the  prophets of old, without action upon their part--that is to say, they did  not attain unto it by taking thought what they should speak or say, for in  the proper hour, when it was needful, it was given to them. This grand  procedure was kept up until the \"Mystery of Christ\" was revealed, or until  the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus  Christ, burst upon the vision of the world. Now, he being the brightness  of the Father's glory and the express image of his person, and it having  pleased the Father that in him all fullness should dwell, he is the \"Light  of the World\"--God's great light bearer. Along with the revelation of  Christ comes a revelation of all the lesser lights that shine out in the  mental and moral heavens, who have been, and are, dependent upon him for  their knowledge, or light. In order to give the world this revelation of  Christ, Jehovah selected his own men, and confirmed their mission, and the  Spirit moved upon their hearts to give light until the Christ, himself,  with all his satellites, should shine forth in the light of life. These  men were the ancient prophets of the \"High and Holy One.\" They were  teachers sent from God. Their mission was confirmed by the wondrous works  which they were enabled to perform. Nicodemus understood this matter when  he said, \"Rabbi, we know thou art a teacher sent from God, for no man can  do these works which thou dost except God be with him.\"    The little Jewish maiden who waited on Naaman's wife understood it, for  she said to her, \"Would to God my Lord were with the prophet in Samaria!  for he would cure him of his leprosy.\" It is said of the disciples of  Christ that they \"went everywhere preaching the word, the Lord working  with them and confirming the word with signs following.\" And also, that  the great salvation, \"which at the first began to be spoken unto us by the  Lord, was confirmed unto us by those who heard him, God also bearing them  witness both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the  Holy Spirit.\" And that the apostles preached the gospel with the Holy  Spirit sent down from heaven.    It was communicated to the prophets and apostles by the Savior, and to the  world at large through them. As proof of this proposition Peter says, \"The  prophets searched diligently with reference to the time which the Spirit  of Christ, that was in them, did signify when it testified beforehand of  the sufferings of Christ and of the glory which should follow.\" It was an  important work for Christ to teach his apostles, and when they had heard  him through all his toils they were not suffered to go forth, or shine as  stars in the church's crown, until they were moved upon by the Spirit of  God to bring to their remembrance those things which Jesus had taught  them. But one other course could have been pursued, and there were  insurmountable difficulties in the way of its adoption, and that was to  make the extraordinary ordinary by causing the Holy Spirit to move upon  all hearts throughout all time, and give to each member of the race,  regardless of his character and the manner in which he might abuse it, the  entire revelation. The first difficulty is in the fact that wicked men who  wilfully deceive would have confronted the best men upon the earth, and  confusion without remedy would have been the result of leaving our world  without a common and infallible test.    Another difficulty appears, in the fact that it would have compromised the  purity of God through the presence of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of all  the vile and abominable sinners of earth. There was one way to avoid these  results, and that was to irresistibly destroy all disposition in human  hearts to have their own way, and so remain unworthy of the presence of  the Divine Spirit; but this would have been a complete destruction of  moral freedom along with all the principles of accountability, and  consequently a destruction of God's moral government. Moral freedom was so  sacred with God that \"the spirit of the prophets was subject to the  prophet.\" Hence, the importance of the searcher of hearts choosing his own  prophets out from among men. \"God, who in ancient times and diverse  manners, spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath, in  these last days, spoken unto us by his son.\" The Lord of Hosts guarded  this great work with reference to the deliverance of man by the most  severe penalty. The law governing the prophets was in these words: \"And  that prophet which shall speak a word in my name which I commanded him  not, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet  shall die.\" He guarded his own infinite and spotless purity. While he was  \"in the generation of the righteous, he was far from the wicked.\" So there  was always, from the time of Adam's offense till the present such a thing  as being \"without God.\"    When the Jewish people became apostate in the times of Malachi, who was  the last Old Testament prophet, the Holy Spirit left the world."]]]
