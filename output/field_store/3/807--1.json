There is no doubt whatever about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the  undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name  was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old  Marley was as dead as a door-nail.    Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is  particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,  to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the  trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my  unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You  will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as  dead as a door-nail.    Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?  Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge  was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole  residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge  was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an  excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised  it with an undoubted bargain.    The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started  from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly  understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to  relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died  before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his  taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,  than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning  out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for  instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.    Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years  afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was  known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called  Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It  was all the same to him.    Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a  squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old  sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out  generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.  The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,  shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin  lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime  was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his  own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the  dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.    External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could  warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than  he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain  less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The  heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the  advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'  handsomely, and Scrooge never did.    Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My  dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars  implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was  o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to  such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to  know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into  doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they  said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'    But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked.

CHAD'S          CHAPTER I    Honor Introduces Herself      \"Any new girls?\"    It was Madge Summers who asked the question, seated on the right-hand  corner of Maisie Talbot's bed, munching caramels. It was a very small  bed, but at that moment it managed to accommodate no less than seven  of Maisie's most particular friends, who were closely watching the  progress of her unpacking, and discussing the latest school news,  interspersed with remarks on her belongings.    Maisie extricated herself from the depths of her box, and handed a pile  of stockings to Lettice, her younger sister.    \"What's the use of asking me?\" she replied. \"Our cab only drove up half  an hour ago. I feel almost new myself yet.\"    \"So do I, and horribly in the blues too,\" said Pauline Reynolds. \"It's  always a wrench to leave home. I'm perfectly miserable for at least  three days at the beginning of each term. I feel as if----\"    \"Oh, don't all begin to expatiate about your feelings!\" broke in Chatty  Burns. \"We know Pauline's symptoms only too well: the first day she  shows aggressively red eyes and a damp pocket-handkerchief; the second  day she writes lengthy letters home, begging to be allowed to return  immediately and have lessons with a private governess; the third day  she wanders about, trying to get sympathy from anyone who is  weak-minded enough to listen to her, till in desperation somebody drags  her into the playground, and makes her have a round at hockey. That  cheers her up, and she begins to think life isn't quite such a desert.  By the fourth morning she has recovered her spirits, and come to the  conclusion that Chessington College is a very decent kind of place; and  she begins to be alarmed lest her mother, on the strength of the  pathetic letter, should have decided to let her leave at once, and  should have already engaged a private governess.\"    \"You're most unsympathetic, Chatty!\" said Pauline, smiling in spite of  herself. \"You don't know what it is to be home-sick.\"    \"I wouldn't parade such a woebegone face, whatever might be the depths  of my misery,\" returned Chatty briskly.    \"I'm always glad to come back,\" declared Dorothy Arkwright. \"I like  school. It's fun to meet everybody again, and arrange about cricket,  and the Debating Society, and the Natural History Club. There's so much  going on at St. Chad's.\"    \"No one has answered my question yet,\" remarked Madge Summers. \"Are  there any new girls?\"    Chatty wriggled herself into a more comfortable position between  Adeline Vaughan and Ruth Latimer.    \"I think there are about a dozen altogether. Vivian Holmes says there  are four at St. Bride's, three at St. Aldwyth's, two at the School  House, and two at St. Hilary's. I saw one of them arriving at the same  time as I did, and Miss Cavendish was gushing over another in the  library; and Marian Spencer has brought a sister--she introduced her to  me just now.\"    \"But what about St. Chad's?\"    \"We've only one, I believe, though Flossie Taylor, the Hammond-Smiths'  cousin, has moved here from St. Bride's. She was always destined for a  Chaddite, you know, only there wasn't room for her till the Richardsons  left.\"    \"She's no great acquisition,\" said Dorothy Arkwright. \"I hate girls to  change their quarters. When once they start at a house, they ought to  stick to it.\"    \"Well, she wants to be with her cousins, I suppose,\" put in Madge  Summers. \"Who's our new girl?\"    \"I don't know. I haven't heard anything about her.\"    \"Perhaps she hasn't arrived yet.\"    \"Sh! Sh!\" said Pauline Reynolds, squeezing Madge's arm by way of  remonstrance, and pointing to the closely-drawn curtains of the cubicle  at the farther end of the room. \"She's here now.\"    \"Where?\"    \"There, you goose!\"    \"What has she shut herself up like that for?\"    \"How should I know?\"    \"Perhaps she's unpacking,\" suggested Dorothy Arkwright.    \"If she is, she'll finish it quicker than Lettice and I can,\" returned  Maisie Talbot. \"Why can't you be hanging up some of those skirts,  instead of sitting staring at me? Yes, this is a whole box of Edinburgh  rock, but you shan't have a single piece, any of you, unless you get  off my bed at once.\"    \"Poor old Maisie, don't grow excited!\" murmured Ruth Latimer,  appropriating the box and handing it round, though no one attempted to  move.    \"But look here! what about this new girl?\" persisted Madge. \"Hasn't  anybody seen her?\"    \"No. She's been in there ever since she arrived.\"    \"Don't talk so loud; she'll hear you.\"    \"I don't care if she does.\"    \"I want to know what she's doing.\"    \"I can tell you, then,\" said Chatty Burns, in a whisper that was more  audible by far than her ordinary voice.    \"What?\"    \"Crying! New girls always cry, and some old ones too, if you take  Pauline as a specimen.\"    \"I'm not crying now!\" protested Pauline indignantly. \"And how can you  tell that the new girl is?\"    \"I'm as certain as if I'd proved a proposition in Euclid. Why should  she have drawn her curtains so closely? If she's not lying on her bed,  with a clean pocket-handkerchief to her eyes, I'll give you six  caramels in exchange for three peppermint creams!\"    \"Then you're just mistaken!\" cried a voice from the end cubicle. The  chintz curtain was pulled aside, and out marched a figure with so  jaunty an air as to banish utterly the idea of possible homesickness or  tears.    It was a girl of about fifteen, a remarkably pretty girl (so her  schoolmates decided, without an instant's hesitation), and rather out  of the common. She had a clear, olive complexion, a lovely colour in  her cheeks, a bewitching pair of dimples, and a perfect colt's mane of  thick, curly, brown hair. Perhaps her nose was a little too tip-tilted,  and her mouth a trifle too wide for absolute beauty; but she showed  such a nice row of even, white teeth when she laughed that one could  overlook the latter deficiency. Her eyes were beyond praise, large and  grey, with a dark line round the iris, and shaded by long lashes; and  they were so soft, and wistful, and winning, and yet so twinkling and  full of fun, that they seemed as if they could compel admiration, and  make friends with their first glance. The girl walked across the room  in an easy, confident fashion, and stood, with a broad smile on her  face, beaming at the seven others seated on Maisie's bed.    \"Why shouldn't I pull my curtains?\" she asked. \"If I'd been pulling  faces, now, you might have had some cause for complaint. You look  rather a nice set; I think I'm going to like you.\"    The girls were so surprised that they could only stare. It seemed  reversing the usual order of things for a new-comer, who ought to be  shy and confused, to be so absolutely and entirely self-possessed, and  to pass judgment with such calm assurance upon these old members of St.  Chad's, some of whom were already in their third year at Chessington  College.    \"Perhaps I'd better introduce myself,\" continued the stranger. \"My name  is Honor Fitzgerald, and I come from Kilmore, near Ballycroghan, in  County Kerry.\"    \"Then you're Irish!\" gasped Chatty Burns.    \"Quite right. First class for geography! County Kerry is exactly in the  bottom left-hand corner of the map of Ireland. It's a more hospitable  place than this is. I've been here nearly two hours, and nobody has  offered me any refreshments yet. I'm simply starving!\"    She looked so humorously and suggestively at the Edinburgh rock that  Madge Summers promptly offered it to her, regardless of the fact that  the box belonged to Maisie Talbot.    \"Come along here,\" said Ruth Latimer, trying to make a place for the  new girl on the bed by pushing the others vigorously"]]]
