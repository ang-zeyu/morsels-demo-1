The waters of the bay contain all manner of fish, wherefore its surface  is ploughed by the keels of all manner of fishing boats manned by all  manner of fishermen. To protect the fish from this motley floating  population many wise laws have been passed, and there is a fish patrol  to see that these laws are enforced. Exciting times are the lot of the  fish patrol: in its history more than one dead patrolman has marked  defeat, and more often dead fishermen across their illegal nets have  marked success.    Wildest among the fisher-folk may be accounted the Chinese  shrimp-catchers. It is the habit of the shrimp to crawl along the  bottom in vast armies till it reaches fresh water, when it turns about  and crawls back again to the salt. And where the tide ebbs and flows,  the Chinese sink great bag-nets to the bottom, with gaping mouths, into  which the shrimp crawls and from which it is transferred to the  boiling-pot. This in itself would not be bad, were it not for the small  mesh of the nets, so small that the tiniest fishes, little new-hatched  things not a quarter of an inch long, cannot pass through. The beautiful  beaches of Points Pedro and Pablo, where are the shrimp-catchers  villages, are made fearful by the stench from myriads of decaying fish,  and against this wasteful destruction it has ever been the duty of the  fish patrol to act.    When I was a youngster of sixteen, a good sloop-sailor and all-round  bay-waterman, my sloop, the _Reindeer_, was chartered by the Fish  Commission, and I became for the time being a deputy patrolman. After a  deal of work among the Greek fishermen of the Upper Bay and rivers,  where knives flashed at the beginning of trouble and men permitted  themselves to be made prisoners only after a revolver was thrust in  their faces, we hailed with delight an expedition to the Lower Bay  against the Chinese shrimp-catchers.    There were six of us, in two boats, and to avoid suspicion we ran down  after dark and dropped anchor under a projecting bluff of land known as  Point Pinole. As the east paled with the first light of dawn we got  under way again, and hauled close on the land breeze as we slanted  across the bay toward Point Pedro. The morning mists curled and clung  to the water so that we could see nothing, but we busied ourselves  driving the chill from our bodies with hot coffee. Also we had to  devote ourselves to the miserable task of bailing, for in some  incomprehensible way the _Reindeer_ had sprung a generous leak. Half  the night had been spent in overhauling the ballast and exploring the  seams, but the labor had been without avail. The water still poured in,  and perforce we doubled up in the cockpit and tossed it out again.    After coffee, three of the men withdrew to the other boat, a Columbia  River salmon boat, leaving three of us in the _Reindeer_. Then the two  craft proceeded in company till the sun showed over the eastern  skyline. Its fiery rays dispelled the clinging vapors, and there,  before our eyes, like a picture, lay the shrimp fleet, spread out in a  great half-moon, the tips of the crescent fully three miles apart, and  each junk moored fast to the buoy of a shrimp-net. But there was no  stir, no sign of life.    The situation dawned upon us. While waiting for slack water, in which  to lift their heavy nets from the bed of the bay, the Chinese had all  gone to sleep below. We were elated, and our plan of battle was swiftly  formed.    \"Throw each of your two men on to a junk,\" whispered Le Grant to me  from the salmon boat. \"And you make fast to a third yourself. We'll do  the same, and there's no reason in the world why we shouldn't capture  six junks at the least.\"    Then we separated. I put the _Reindeer_ about on the other tack, ran up  under the lee of a junk, shivered the mainsail into the wind and lost  headway, and forged past the stern of the junk so slowly and so near  that one of the patrolmen stepped lightly aboard. Then I kept off,  filled the mainsail, and bore away for a second junk.    Up to this time there had been no noise, but from the first junk  captured by the salmon boat an uproar now broke forth. There was shrill  Oriental yelling, a pistol shot, and more yelling.    \"It's all up. They're warning the others,\" said George, the remaining  patrolman, as he stood beside me in the cockpit.    By this time we were in the thick of the fleet, and the alarm was  spreading with incredible swiftness. The decks were beginning to swarm  with half-awakened and half-naked Chinese. Cries and yells of warning  and anger were flying over the quiet water, and somewhere a conch shell  was being blown with great success. To the right of us I saw the  captain of a junk chop away his mooring line with an axe and spring to  help his crew at the hoisting of the huge, outlandish lug-sail. But to  the left the first heads were popping up from below on another junk, and  I rounded up the _Reindeer_ alongside long enough for George to spring  aboard.    The whole fleet was now under way. In addition to the sails they had  gotten out long sweeps, and the bay was being ploughed in every  direction by the fleeing junks. I was now alone in the _Reindeer_,  seeking feverishly to capture a third prize. The first junk I took after  was a clean miss, for it trimmed its sheets and shot away surprisingly  into the wind. By fully half a point it outpointed the _Reindeer_, and I  began to feel respect for the clumsy craft. Realizing the hopelessness  of the pursuit, I filled away, threw out the main-sheet, and drove down  before the wind upon the junks to leeward, where I had them at a  disadvantage.    The one I had selected wavered indecisively before me, and, as I swung  wide to make the boarding gentle, filled suddenly and darted away, the  swart Mongols shouting a wild rhythm as they bent to the sweeps. But I  had been ready for this. I luffed suddenly. Putting the tiller hard  down, and holding it down with my body, I brought the main-sheet in,  hand over hand, on the run, so as to retain all possible striking  force. The two starboard sweeps of the junk were crumpled up, and then  the two boats came together with a crash. The _Reindeer's_ bowsprit,  like a monstrous hand, reached over and ripped out the junk's chunky  mast and towering sail.    This was met by a curdling yell of rage. A big Chinaman, remarkably  evil-looking, with his head swathed in a yellow silk handkerchief and  face badly pock-marked, planted a pike-pole on the _Reindeer's_ bow and  began to shove the entangled boats apart. Pausing long enough to let go  the jib halyards, and just as the _Reindeer_ cleared and began to drift  astern, I leaped aboard the junk with a line and made fast. He of the  yellow handkerchief and pock-marked face came toward me threateningly,  but I put my hand into my hip pocket, and he hesitated. I was unarmed,  but the Chinese have learned to be fastidiously careful of American hip  pockets, and it was upon this that I depended to keep him and his  savage crew at a distance.    I ordered him to drop the anchor at the junk's bow, to which he replied,  \"No sabbe.\" The crew responded in like fashion, and though I made my  meaning plain by signs, they refused to understand. Realizing the  inexpediency of discussing the matter, I went forward myself, overran  the line, and let the anchor go.    \"Now get aboard, four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28696"],[0,"Symbolic Logic (#1)"],[1,"Smith and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team  at https://www.pgdp.net                                                                                 pg-i    SYMBOLIC LOGIC    By Lewis Carroll                                                                     pg-ii                                                                     pg-iii                                                                     pg-iv    A Syllogism worked out.

Triliteral and Multiliteral  Propositions (such as \"All abc are de\"). Hypotheticals. Dilemmas. &c.  &c.    _Part III. TRANSCENDENTAL._    Analysis of a Proposition into its Elements.

The chief alterations, since the First Edition, have been made in the  Chapter on 'Classification' (pp. 2, 3) and the Book on 'Propositions'  (pp. 10 to 19). The chief additions have been the questions on words and  phrases, added to the Examination-Papers at p. 94, and the Notes  inserted at pp. 164, 194.    In Book I, Chapter II, I have adopted a new definition of  'Classification', which enables me to regard the whole Universe as a  'Class,' and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase 'a Set of  Things.'    In the Chapter on 'Propositions of Existence' I have adopted a new  'normal form,' in which the Class, whose existence is affirmed or  denied, is regarded as the _Predicate_, instead of the _Subject_, of the  Proposition, thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the  other form. These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every  Tree of Knowledge, and they are _far_ more hopeless to grapple with than  any that occur in its higher branches. For example, the difficulties of  the Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child's play compared  with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential  nature of a straight Line. And, in the present work, the difficulties of  the \"5 Liars\" Problem, at p. 192, are \"trifles, light as air,\" compared  with the bewildering question \"What is a Thing?\"    In the Chapter on 'Propositions of Relation' I have inserted a new  Section, containing the proof that a Proposition, beginning with \"All,\"  is a _Double_ Proposition (a fact that is quite independent of the  arbitrary rule, laid down in the next Section, that such a Proposition  is to be understood as implying the actual _existence_ of its Subject).  This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the  course of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its _proper_  place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it.                                                                     pg-ix  In the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in  order to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of  the Readers of the first three Editions. Some of the Premisses were so  worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ. named in the  Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ. was only a  portion. In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should  perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted  of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of  its _other_ portion. Thus, in Ex. 15, the Univ. was stated to be \"ducks  in this village,\" and the third Premiss was \"Mrs. Bond has no gray  ducks,\" i.e. \"No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs. Bond.\" Here the  Terms are _not_ Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class \"ducks,\"  of which the Univ. is only a portion: and it was intended that the  Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of \"ducks\" is thereby  asserted of \"ducks in this village.\" and should treat this Premiss as if  it were \"Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks in this village,\" and should  ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the _other_ portion of the  Class \"ducks,\" viz. \"Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks _out of_ this village\".    In the Appendix I have given a new version of the Problem of the \"Five  Liars.\" My object, in doing so, is to escape the subtle and mysterious  difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a Proposition as  being its own Subject, or a Set of Propositions as being Subjects for  one another. It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory  theory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of  _substance_ in all this shadowy host----that, as the procession of  phantoms glides before us, there is not _one_ that we can pounce upon,  and say \"_Here_ is a Proposition that _must_ be either true or  false!\"----that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been  bidden----and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island,  whose inhabitants \"earned a precarious living by taking in each others'  washing\"! By simply translating \"telling 2 Truths\" into \"taking _both_  of 2 condiments (salt and mustard),\" \"telling 2 Lies\" into \"taking  _neither_ of them\" and \"telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)\"  into \"taking only _one_ condiment (it is not specified _which_),\" I have  escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem  which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the  very same _Data_ as were furnished by the Problem of the \"Five Liars.\"                                                                     pg-x  The coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as \"Eliminands\"  and \"Retinends\", perhaps hardly need any apology: they were  indispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first  time, viz. \"Soriteses\", will, I fear, be condemned as \"bad English\",  unless I say a word in its defence. We have _three_ singular nouns, in  English, of plural _form_, \"series\", \"species\", and \"Sorites\": in all  three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and  plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case  of \"series\" by coining the plural \"serieses\", which has already found  its way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely  \"following suit\", in using the new plural \"Soriteses\".    In conclusion, let me point out that even those, who are obliged to  study _Formal_ Logic, with a view to being able to answer  Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of _Symbolic_  Logic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the  obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a  delightfully easy method of _testing_ the results arrived at by the  cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries.    This is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own  little book, _The Game of Logic_, published in 1886, a very incomplete  performance) that has been made to _popularise_ this fascinating  subject. It has cost me _years_ of hard work: but if it should prove, as  I hope it may, to be of _real_ service"]]]
