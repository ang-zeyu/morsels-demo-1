INTRODUCTION      The author of this book, my brother, died in a French military hospital  of the effects of exposure in the last fierce fighting that broke the  Prussian power over Christendom; fighting for which he had volunteered  after being invalided home. Any notes I can jot down about him must  necessarily seem jerky and incongruous; for in such a relation memory is  a medley of generalisation and detail, not to be uttered in words. One  thing at least may fitly be said here. Before he died he did at least  two things that he desired. One may seem much greater than the other;  but he would not have shrunk from naming them together. He saw the end  of an empire that was the nightmare of the nations; but I believe it  pleased him almost as much that he had been able, often in the intervals  of bitter warfare and by the aid of a brilliant memory, to put together  these pages on the history, so necessary and so strangely neglected, of  the great democracy which he never patronised, which he not only loved  but honoured.    Cecil Edward Chesterton was born on November 12, 1879; and there is a  special if a secondary sense in which we may use the phrase that he was  born a fighter. It may seem in some sad fashion a flippancy to say that  he argued from his very cradle. It is certainly, in the same sad  fashion, a comfort, to remember one truth about our relations: that we  perpetually argued and that we never quarrelled. In a sense it was the  psychological truth, I fancy, that we never quarrelled because we always  argued. His lucidity and love of truth kept things so much on the level  of logic, that the rest of our relations remained, thank God, in solid  sympathy; long before that later time when, in substance, our argument  had become an agreement. Nor, I think, was the process valueless; for  at least we learnt how to argue in defence of our agreement. But the  retrospect is only worth a thought now, because it illustrates a duality  which seemed to him, and is, very simple; but to many is baffling in its  very simplicity. When I say his weapon was logic, it will be currently  confused with formality or even frigidity: a silly superstition always  pictures the logician as a pale-faced prig. He was a living proof, a  very living proof, that the precise contrary is the case. In fact it is  generally the warmer and more sanguine sort of man who has an appetite  for abstract definitions and even abstract distinctions. He had all the  debating dexterity of a genial and generous man like Charles Fox. He  could command that more than legal clarity and closeness which really  marked the legal arguments of a genial and generous man like Danton. In  his wonderfully courageous public speaking, he rather preferred being a  debator to being an orator; in a sense he maintained that no man had a  right to be an orator without first being a debater. Eloquence, he said,  had its proper place when reason had proved a thing to be right, and it  was necessary to give men the courage to do what was right. I think he  never needed any man's eloquence to give him that. But the substitution  of sentiment for reason, in the proper place for reason, affected him  \"as musicians are affected by a false note.\" It was the combination of  this intellectual integrity with extraordinary warmth and simplicity in  the affections that made the point of his personality. The snobs and  servile apologists of the _regime_ he resisted seem to think they can  atone for being hard-hearted by being soft-headed. He reversed, if ever  a man did, that relation in the organs. The opposite condition really  covers all that can be said of him in this brief study; it is the clue  not only to his character but to his career.    If rationalism meant being rational (which it hardly ever does) he might  at every stage of his life be called a red-hot rationalist. Thus, for  instance, he very early became a Socialist and joined the Fabian  Society, on the executive of which he played a prominent part for some  years. But he afterwards gave the explanation, very characteristic for  those who could understand it, that what he liked about the Fabian sort  of Socialism was its hardness. He meant intellectual hardness; the fact  that the society avoided sentimentalism, and dealt in affirmations and  not mere associations. He meant that upon the Fabian basis a Socialist  was bound to believe in Socialism, but not in sandals, free love,  bookbinding, and immediate disarmament. But he also added that, while he  liked their hardness, he disliked their moderation. In other words, when  he discovered, or believed that he discovered, that their intellectual  hardness was combined with moral hardness, or rather moral deadness, he  felt all the intellectual ice melted by a moral flame. He had, so to  speak, a reaction of emotional realism, in which he saw, as suddenly as  simple men can see simple truths, the potterers of Social Reform as the  plotters of the Servile State. He was himself, above all things, a  democrat as well as a Socialist; and in that intellectual sect he began  to feel as if he were the only Socialist who was also a democrat. His  dogmatic, democratic conviction would alone illustrate the falsity of  the contrast between logic and life. The idea of human equality existed  with extraordinary clarity in his brain, precisely because it existed  with extraordinary simplicity in his character. His popular sympathies,  unlike so many popular sentiments, could really survive any intimacy  with the populace; they followed the poor not only at public meetings  but to public houses. He was literally the only man I ever knew who was  not only never a snob, but apparently never tempted to be a snob. The  fact is almost more important than his wonderful lack of fear; for such  good causes, when they cannot be lost by fear, are often lost by favour.    Thus he came to suspect that Socialism was merely social reform, and  that social reform was merely slavery. But the point still is that  though his attitude to it was now one of revolt, it was anything but a  mere revulsion of feeling. He did, indeed, fall back on fundamental  things, on a fury at the oppression of the poor, on a pity for slaves,  and especially for contented slaves. But it is the mark of his type of  mind that he did not abandon Socialism without a rational case against  it, and a rational system to oppose to it. The theory he substituted  for Socialism is that which may for convenience be called  Distributivism; the theory that private property is proper to every  private citizen. This is no place for its exposition; but it will be  evident that such a conversion brings the convert into touch with much  older traditions of human freedom, as expressed in the family or the  guild. And it was about the same time that, having for some time held an  Anglo-Catholic position, he joined the Roman Catholic Church. It is  notable, in connection with the general argument, that while the deeper  reasons for such a change do not concern such a sketch as this, he was  again characteristically amused and annoyed with the sentimentalists,  sympathetic or hostile, who supposed he was attracted by ritual, music,  and emotional mysticism. He told such people, somewhat to their  bewilderment, that he had been converted because Rome alone could  satisfy the reason. In his case, of course, as in Newman's and  numberless others, well-meaning people conceived a thousand crooked or  complicated explanations, rather than suppose that an obviously honest  man believed a thing because he thought it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#1)"],[1,"Sutherland, Leonard Johnson and the Online Distributed  Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/Million Book Project)                A HANDBOOK  OF  SOME SOUTH INDIAN GRASSES      BY  RAI BAHADUR K.

For the past few years I have been receiving  grasses for identification, almost every week, from the officers of the  Agricultural and Forest Departments and others interested in grasses.  The requirements of these men and the absence of a suitable book induced  me to write this book.    I have included in this book about one hundred grasses of wide  distribution in the plains of South India. Many of them occur also in  other parts of India. The rarer grasses of the plains and those growing  on the hills are omitted, with a view to deal with them separately.    The value of grasses can be realized from the fact that man can supply  all his needs from them alone, and their importance in agriculture is  very great, as the welfare of the cattle is dependent upon grasses.  Farmers, as a rule, take no interest in them, although profitable  agriculture is impossible without grasses. Very few of them can give the  names of at least half a dozen grasses growing on their land. They  neglect grasses, because they are common and are found everywhere. They  cannot discriminate between them. To a farmer \"grass is grass\" and that  is all he cares to trouble himself about. About grasses Robinson writes  \"Grass is King. It rules and governs the world. It is the very  foundation of all commerce: without it the earth would be a barren  waste, and cotton, gold, and commerce all dead.\"    In the early days when the population was very much limited and when  land not brought under cultivation was extensive plenty of green grasses  was upon it and pastures were numerous. So the farmer paid no attention  to the grasses, and it did not matter much. But now, population has  increased, unoccupied land has decreased very much and the cattle have  increased in number. Consequently he has to pay more attention to  grasses.    On account of the scarcity of fodder, people interested in agriculture  and cattle rearing have very often imported foreign grasses and fodder  plants into this country, but so far no one has succeeded in  establishing any one of them on any large scale. Usually a great amount  of labour and much money is spent in these attempts. If the same amount  of attention is bestowed on indigenous grasses, better results can be  obtained with less labour and money. There are many indigenous grasses  that will yield plenty of stuff, if they are given a chance to grow. The  present deterioration of grasses is mainly due to overgrazing and  trampling by men and cattle.    To prove the beneficial effects which result from preventing overgrazing  and trampling, Mr. G. R. Hilson, Deputy Director of Agriculture (now  Cotton Expert), selected some portion of the waste land in the  neighbourhood of the Farm at Hagari and closed it for men and cattle. As  a result of this measure, in two years, a number of grasses and other  plants were found growing on the enclosed area very well, and all of  them seeded well. Of course the unenclosed areas were bare as usual.    In the preparation of this book I received considerable help from  M.R.Ry. C. Tadulinga Mudaliyar Avargal, F.L.S., Assistant Lecturing and  Systematic Botanist, in the description of species and I am indebted to  M.R.Ry. P.S. Jivanna Rao, M.A., Teaching Assistant, for assistance in  proofreading.    I have to express my deep obligation to Mr. G. A. D. Stuart, I.C.S.,  Director of Agriculture, for encouragement to undertake this work and to  the Madras Government for ordering its publication.

CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTION.      Grasses occupy wide tracts of land and they are evenly distributed in  all parts of the world. They occur in every soil, in all kinds of  situations and under all climatic conditions. In certain places grasses  form a leading feature of the flora. As grasses do not like shade, they  are not usually abundant within the forests either as regards the number  of individuals, or of species. But in open places they do very well and  sometimes whole tracts become grass-lands. Then a very great portion of  the actual vegetation would consist of grasses.    On account of their almost universal distribution and their great  economic value grasses are of great importance to man. And yet very few  people appreciate the worth of grasses. Although several families of  plants supply the wants of man, the grass family exceeds all the others  in the amount and the value of its products. The grasses growing in  pasture land and the cereals grown all over the world are of more value  to man and his domestic animals than all the other plants taken  together.    To the popular mind grasses are only herbaceous plants with narrow  leaves such as the hariali, ginger grass and the kolakattai grass. But  in the grass family or Gramineae the cereals, sugarcane and bamboos are  also included.    Grasses are rather interesting in that they are usually successful in  occupying large tracts of land to the exclusion of other plants. If we  take into consideration the number of individuals of any species of  grass, they will be found to out-number those of any species of any  other family. Even as regards the number of species this family ranks  fifth, the first four places being occupied respectively by Compositae,  Leguminosae, Orchideae and Rubiaceae.    As grasses form an exceedingly natural family it is very difficult for  beginners to readily distinguish them from one another.    The leaves and branches of grasses are very much alike and the flowers  are so small that they are liable to be passed by unnoticed. The  recognition of even our common grasses is quite a task for a botanist.    To understand the general structure of grasses and to become familiar  with them it is necessary to study closely some common grasses. We shall  begin our study by selecting as a type one of the species of the genus  Panicum.    _Panicum javanicum_ is an annual herb with stems radiating in all  directions from a centre. The plant is fixed to the soil by a tuft of  fibrous roots all springing from the bases of the stems. In addition to  this crown of fibrous roots, there may be roots at the nodes of some of  the prostrate branches. The stems and branches are short at first, and  leaves arise on them one after the other in rapid succession. After the  appearance of a fair number of leaves the stem elongates gradually and  it finally ends in an inflorescence.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Panicum javanicum. (Full plant.)]    The stem consists of =nodes= and =internodes=. The internodes are  cylindrical and somewhat flattened on the side towards the axillary bud.  When young they are completely covered by the leaves and the older ones  have only their lower portions covered by the leaf-sheaths. Usually they  complete their growth in length very soon, but the lower portion of the  internode, just above the node and enclosed by the sheath, retains its  power of growth for some time.    The leaf consists of the two parts, the =leaf-sheath= and the  =leaf-blade=. At the junction of these two parts there is a very thin  narrow membrane with fine hairs on its free margin. This is called the  =ligule=. (See fig. 2.)    The leaf-sheath is attached at its base to the node and it is slightly  swollen just above the place of insertion. It covers the internode, one  margin being inside and the other outside. The surface of the sheath is  sparsely covered with long hairs springing from small tubercles. The  outer margin of the sheath bears fine hairs all along its length. (See  fig. 2.)    The leaf-blade is broadly lanceolate, with a tip finely drawn out. Its  base is rounded and the margin wavy, especially so towards the base. On  the margin towards the base long hairs are seen, and some of these arise  from small tubercles. The margin has a hyaline border which is very  minutely serrate. There is a distinct midrib and, on holding the leaf  against the light, four or five small veins come in"]]]
