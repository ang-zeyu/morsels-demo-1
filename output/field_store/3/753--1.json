S.,    PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY AND OPERATIVE SURGERY IN THE VETERINARY COLLEGE OF  PHILADELPHIA; LATE PROFESSOR OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IN THE AGRICULTURAL  COLLEGE OF OHIO; SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY ASSOCIATION  OF PHILADELPHIA; AUTHOR OF \"THE HORSE  AND HIS DISEASES,\" ETC., ETC.    [Illustration: With Numerous Illustrations.]    PHILADELPHIA:  John E. Potter and Company,  617 Sansom Street.    Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1864, by  JOHN E. POTTER,  In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, in and  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.          PREFACE.      A marked interest has of late years been manifested in our country  relative to the subject of breeding and rearing domestic cattle. This  has not been confined to the dairyman alone. The greater portion of  intelligent agriculturists have perceived the necessity of paying more  attention than was formerly devoted to the improvement and perfection of  breeds for the uses of the table as well. In this respect, European  cattle-raisers have long taken the precedence of our own.    The gratifying favor with which the author's former publication, \"The  Horse and his Diseases,\" has been received by the public, has induced  him to believe that a work, similar in spirit and general treatment,  upon Cattle, would not be without interest for the agricultural  community.    In this belief, the present treatise has been prepared. The author has  availed himself of the labors of others in this connection; never,  however, adopting results and conclusions, no matter how strongly  endorsed, which have been contradicted by his own observation and  experience. In a field like the one in question, assuredly, if anywhere,  some degree of independent judgment will not be censured by those who  are familiar with the sad consequences resulting from the attempted  application of theories now universally exploded, but which in the day  and generation of their originators were sanctioned and advocated by  those who claimed to be magnates in this department.    To the following works, especially, the author acknowledges himself  indebted: American Farmer's Encyclopaedia; Stephens's Book of the Farm;  Flint's Milch-Cows and Dairy Farming; Laurence on Cattle; Allen's  Domestic Animals; Youatt and Martin on Cattle; Thomson's Food of  Animals; Allen's Rural Architecture; Colman's Practical Agriculture and  Rural Economy; Goodale's Breeding of Domestic Animals; and Prof.  Gamgee's valuable contributions to veterinary science.    Particular attention is requested to the division of \"Diseases.\" Under  this head, as in his former work, the author has endeavored to detail  the symptoms of the most common ailments of cattle in such a manner that  every farmer and cattle-owner can at once understand them, and also to  suggest such procurable remedies as a wide experience has proved to be  most efficacious.    A generous space has been devoted to the consideration of that fatal  epidemic, now generally known as \"Pleuro-Pneumonia,\" as it has  manifested itself in Europe and this country, in the belief that a  matter of such vital importance to the stock-raiser ought to receive a  complete exposition in a work like the present. As the author's personal  experience in connection with the treatment of this peculiar disease has  been, perhaps, as large and varied as that of any American practitioner,  he is not without the hope that his views upon the matter may prove  productive of some benefit to others.    Should the present volume prove as acceptable to those interested as did  his former work, the author will be abundantly satisfied that he has not  mistaken in this instance the wants of the public.
