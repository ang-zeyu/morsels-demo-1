Translated From The  Icelandic By Eirikr Magnusson And William Morris    1875        CHAPTER I.     Of King Belt and Thorstein Vikingson and their Children.    Thus beginneth the tale, telling how that King Beli ruled over  Sogn-land; three children had he, whereof Helgi was his first son, and  Halfdan his second, but Ingibiorg his daughter. Ingibiorg was fair of  face and wise of mind, and she was ever accounted the foremost of the  king's children.    Now a certain strand went west of the firth, and a great stead was  thereon, which was called Baldur's Meads; a Place of Peace was there,  and a great temple, and round about it a great garth of pales: many  gods were there, but amidst them all was Baldur held of most account. So  jealous were the heathen men of this stead, that they would have no hurt  done therein to man nor beast, nor might any man have dealings with a  woman there.    Sowstrand was the name of that stead whereas the king dwelt; but on  the other side the firth was an abode named Foreness, where dwelt a man  called Thorstein, the son of Viking; and his stead was over against the  king's dwelling.    Thorstein had a son by his wife called Frithiof: he was the tallest and  strongest of men, and more furnished of all prowess than any other man,  even from his youth up. Frithiof the Bold was he called, and so well  beloved was he, that all prayed for good things for him.    Now the king's children were but young when their mother died; but a  goodman of Sogn, named Hilding, prayed to have the king's daughter to  foster: so there was she reared well and needfully: and she was called  Ingibiorg the Fair. Frithiof also was fostered of goodman Hilding,  wherefore was he foster-brother to the king's daughter, and they two  were peerless among children.    Now King Beli's chattels began to ebb fast away from his hands, for he  was grown old.    Thorstein had rule over the third part of the realm, and in him lay the  king's greatest strength.    Every third year Thorstein feasted the king at exceeding great cost, and  the king feasted Thorstein the two years between.    Helgi, Beli's son, from his youth up turned much to blood-offering:  neither were those brethren well-beloved.    Thorstein had a ship called Ellidi, which pulled fifteen oars on either  board; it ran up high stem and stern, and was strong-built like an  ocean-going ship, and its bulwarks were clamped with iron.    So strong was Frithiof that he pulled the two bow oars of Ellidi;  but either oar was thirteen ells long, and two men pulled every oar  otherwhere.    Frithiof was deemed peerless amid the young men of that time, and the  king's sons envied him, whereas he was more praised than they.    Now King Beli fell sick; and when the sickness lay heavy on him he  called his sons to him and said to them: \"This sickness will bring me to  mine end, therefore will I bid you this, that ye hold fast to those old  friends that I have had; for meseems in all things ye fall short of that  father and son, Thorstein and Frithiof, yea, both in good counsel and in  hardihood. A mound ye shall raise over me.\"    So with that Beli died.    Thereafter Thorstein fell sick; so he spake to Frithiof: \"Kinsman,\" says  he, \"I will crave this of thee, that thou bow thy will before the king's  sons, for their dignity's sake; yet doth my heart speak goodly things to  me concerning thy fortune. Now would I be laid in my mound over against  King Beli's mound, down by the sea on this side the firth, whereas it  may be easiest for us to cry out each to each of tidings drawing nigh.\"    A little after this Thorstein departed, and was laid in mound even as he  had bidden; but Frithiof took the land and chattels after him. Biorn  and Asmund were Frithiof s foster-brethren; they were big and strong men  both.          CHAPTER II.     Frithiof wooeth Ingibiorg of those Brethren.    So Frithiof became the most famed of men, and the bravest in all things  that may try a man.    Biorn, his foster-brother, he held in most account of all, but Asmund  served the twain of them.    The ship Ellidi, he gat, the best of good things, of his father's  heritage, and another possession therewith--a gold ring; no dearer was  in Norway.    So bounteous a man was Frithiof withal, that it was the talk of most,  that he was a man of no less honour than those brethren, but it were  for the name of king; and for this cause they held Frithiof in hate and  enmity, and it was a heavy thing to them that he was called greater  than they: furthermore they thought they could see that Ingibiorg, their  sister, and Frithiof were of one mind together.    It befell hereon that the kings had to go to a feast to Frithiof s house  at Foreness; and there it happened according to wont that he gave to all  men beyond that they were worthy of. Now Ingibiorg was there, and she  and Frithiof talked long together; and the king's daughter said to  him:--              \"A goodly gold ring hast thou.\"            \"Yea, in good sooth,\" said he.    Thereafter went those brethren to their own home, and greater grew their  enmity of Frithiof.    A little after grew Frithiof heavy of mood, and Biorn, his  foster-brother, asked him why he fared so.    He said he had it in his mind to woo Ingibiorg. \"For though I be named  by a lesser name than those brethren, yet am I not fashioned lesser.\"    \"Even so let us do then,\" quoth Biorn. So Frithiof fared with certain  men unto those brethren; and the kings were sitting on their father's  mound when Frithiof greeted them well, and then set forth his wooing,  and prayed for their sister Ingibiorg, the daughter of Beli.    The kings said: \"Not overwise is this thine asking, whereas thou wouldst  have us give her to one who lacketh dignity; wherefore we gainsay thee  this utterly.\"    Said Frithiof: \"Then is mine errand soon sped; but in return never will  I give help to you henceforward, nay, though ye need it ever so much.\"    They said they heeded it nought: so Frithiof went home, and was joyous  once more.          CHAPTER III.     Of King Ring and those Brethren.    There was a king named Ring, who ruled over Ringrealm, which also was in  Norway: a mighty folk-king he was, and a great man, but come by now unto  his latter days.    Now he spake to his men: \"Lo, I have heard that the sons of King Beli  have brought to nought their friendship with Frithiof, who is the  noblest of men; wherefore will I send men to these kings, and bid them  choose whether they will submit them to me and pay me tribute, or else  that I bring war on them: and all things then shall lie ready to my hand  to take, for they have neither might nor wisdom to withstand me; yet  great fame were it to my old age to overcome them.\"    After that fared the messengers of King Ring, and found those brethren,  Helgi and Halfdan, in Sogn, and spake to them thus: \"King Ring sends  bidding to you to send him tribute, or else will he war against your  realm.\"    They answered and said that they would not learn in the days of their  youth what they would be loth to know in their old age, even how to  serve King Ring with shame. \"Nay, now shall we draw together all the  folk that we may.\"    Even so they did; but now, when they beheld their force that it was but  little, they sent Hilding their fosterer to Frithiof to bid him come  help them against King Ring. Now Frithiof sat at the knave-play when  Hilding came thither, who spake thus: \"Our kings send thee greeting,  Frithiof, and would have thy help in battle against King Ring, who  cometh against their realm with violence and wrong.\"    Frithiof answered him nought, but said to Biorn, with whom he was  playing: \"A bare place in thy board, foster-brother, and nowise mayst  thou amend it; nay, for my part I shall beset thy red piece there, and  wot whether it be safe.\"    Then Hilding spake again:    \"King Helgi bade me say thus much, Frithiof, that thou shouldst go on  this journey with them, or else look for ill at their hands when they at  the last come back.\"    \"A double game, foster-brother,\" said Biorn; \"and two ways to meet thy  play.\"    Frithiof said: \"Thy play is to fall first on the knave, yet the double  game is sure to be.\"    No other outcome of his errand had Hilding: he went back speedily to the  kings, and told them Frithiof's answer.    They asked Hilding what he made out of those words. He said:    \"Whereas he spake of the bare place he will have been thinking of the  lack in this journey of yours; but when he said he would beset the red  piece, that will mean Ingibiorg, your sister; so give ye all the heed ye  may to her. But whereas I threatened him with ill from you, Biorn deemed  the game a double one; but Frithiof said that the knave must be set on  first, speaking thereby of King Ring.\"    So then the brethren arrayed them for departing; but, ere they went,  they let bring Ingibioig and eight women with her to Baldur's Meads,  saying that Frithiof would not be so mad rash as to go see her thither,  since there was none who durst make riot there.    Then fared those brethren south to Jadar, and met King Ring in  Sogn-Sound.    Now, herewith was King Ring most of all wroth that the brothers had said  that they accounted it a shame to fight with a man so old that he might  not get a-horseback unholpen.          CHAPTER IV.     Frithiof goes to Baldur's Meads.    Straightway whenas the kings were gone away Frithiof took his raiment  of state and set the goodly gold ring on his arm; then went the  foster-brethren down to the sea and launched Ellidi. Then said Biorn:  \"Whither away, foster-brother?\"    \"To Baldur's Meads,\" said Frithiof, \"to be glad with Ingibiorg.\",    Biorn said: \"A thing unmeet to do, to make the gods wroth with us.\"    \"Well, it shall be risked this time,\" said Frithiof; \"and withal, more  to me is Ingibiorg's grace than Baldur's grame.\"    Therewith they rowed over the firth, and went up "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24421"],[0,"The Story of Gunnlaug the Worm-Tongue and Raven the Skald (#1)"],[1,"STORY OF GUNNLAUG THE WORM-TONGUE AND RAVEN THE SKALD.

CHAPTER I.     Of Thorstein Egilson and his Kin.    There was a man called Thorstein, the son of Egil, the son of  Skallagrim, the son of Kveldulf the Hersir of Norway. Asgerd was the  mother of Thorstein; she was the daughter of Biorn Hold. Thorstein dwelt  at Burg in Burg-firth; he was rich of fee, and a great chief, a wise  man, meek and of measure in all wise. He was nought of such wondrous  growth and strength as his father Egil had been; yet was he a right  mighty man, and much beloved of all folk.    Thorstein was goodly to look on, flaxen-haired, and the best-eyed of  men; and so say men of lore that many of the kin of the Mere-men, who  are come of Egil, have been the goodliest folk; yet, for all that, this  kindred have differed much herein, for it is said that some of them have  been accounted the most ill-favoured of men: but in that kin have been  also many men of great prowess in many wise, such as Kiartan, the son of  Olaf Peacock, and Slaying-Bardi, and Skuli, the son of Thorstein. Some  have been great bards, too, in that kin, as Biorn, the champion of  Hit-dale, priest Einar Skulison, Snorri Sturluson, and many others.    Now, Thorstein had to wife Jofrid, the daughter of Gunnar, the son of  Hlifar. This Gunnar was the best skilled in weapons, and the lithest of  limb of all bonderfolk who have been in Iceland; the second was Gunnar  of Lithend; but Steinthor of Ere was the third. Jofrid was eighteen  winters old when Thorstein wedded her; she was a widow, for Thorodd,  son of Odd of Tongue, had had her to wife aforetime. Their daughter was  Hungerd, who was brought up at Thorstein's at Burg. Jofrid was a very  stirring woman; she and Thorstein had many children betwixt them, but  few of them come into this tale. Skuli was the eldest of their sons,  Kollsvein the second, Egil the third.          CHAPTER II.     Of Thorsteins Dream.    One summer, it is said, a ship came from over the main into Gufaros.  Bergfinn was he hight who was the master thereof, a Northman of kin,  rich in goods, and somewhat stricken in years, and a wise man he was  withal.    Now, goodman Thorstein rode to the ship, as it was his wont mostly  to rule the market, and this he did now. The Eastmen got housed, but  Thorstein took the master to himself, for thither he prayed to go.  Bergfinn was of few words throughout the winter, but Thorstein treated  him well The Eastman had great joy of dreams.    One day in spring-tide Thorstein asked Bergfinn if he would ride with  him up to Hawkfell, where at that time was the Thing-stead of the  Burg-firthers; for Thorstein had been told that the walls of his booth  had fallen in. The Eastman said he had good will to go, so that day they  rode, some three together, from home, and the house-carles of Thorstein  withal, till they came up under Hawkfell to a farmstead called Foxholes.  There dwelt a man of small wealth called Atli, who was Thorstein's  tenant Thorstein bade him come and work with them, and bring with him  hoe and spade. This he did, and when they came to the tofts of the  booth, they set to work all of them, and did out the walls.    The weather was hot with sunshine that day, and Thorstein and the  Eastman grew heavy; and when they had moved out the walls, those two sat  down within the tofts, and Thorstein slept, and fared ill in his sleep.  The Eastman sat beside him, and let him have his dream fully out, and  when he awoke he was much wearied. Then the Eastman asked him what he  had dreamt, as he had had such an ill time of it in his sleep.    Thorstein said, \"Nay, dreams betoken nought.\"    But as they rode homeward in the evening, the Eastman asked him again  what he had dreamt.    Thorstein said, \"If I tell thee the dream, then shalt thou unriddle it  to me, as it verily is.\"    The Eastman said he would risk it.    Then Thorstein said: \"This was my dream; for methought I was at home  at Burg, standing outside the men's-door, and I looked up at the  house-roof, and on the ridge I saw a swan, goodly and fair, and I  thought it was mine own, and deemed it good beyond all things. Then I  saw a great eagle sweep down from the mountains, and fly thitherward and  alight beside the swan, and chuckle over her lovingly; and methouht  the swan seemed well content thereat; but I noted that the eagle was  black-eyed, and that on him were iron claws: valiant he seemed to me.    \"After this I thought I saw another fowl come flying from the south  quarter, and he, too, came hither to Burg, and sat down on the house  beside the swan, and would fain be fond with her. This also was a mighty  eagle.    \"But soon I thought that the eagle first-come ruffled up at the coming  of the other. Then they fought fiercely and long, and this I saw that  both bled, and such was the end of their play, that each tumbled either  way down from the house-roof, and there they lay both dead.    \"But the swan sat left alone, drooping much, and sad of semblance.    \"Then I saw a fowl fly from the west; that was a falcon, and he sat  beside the swan and made fondly towards her, and they flew away both  together into one and the same quarter, and therewith I awoke.    \"But a dream of no mark this is,\" he says, \"and will in all likelihood  betoken gales, that they shall meet in the air from those quarters  whence I deemed the fowl flew.\"    The Eastman spake: \"I deem it nowise such,\" saith he.    Thorstein said, \"Make of the dream, then, what seemeth likest to thee,  and let me hear.\"    Then said the Eastman: \"These birds are like to be fetches of men: but  thy wife sickens now, and she will give birth to a woman-child fair and  lovely; and dearly thou wilt love her; but high-born men shall woo thy  daughter, coming from such quarters as the eagles seemed to fly from,  and shall love her with overweening love, and shall fight about her,  and both lose their lives thereby. And thereafter a third man, from the  quarter whence came the falcon, shall woo her, and to that man shall  she be wedded. Now, I have unravelled thy dream, and I think things will  befall as I have said.\"    Thorstein answered: \"In evil and unfriendly wise is the dream  interpreted, nor do I deem thee fit for the work of unriddling dreams.\"    Then Eastman said, \"Thou shalt find how it will come to pass.\"    But Thorstein estranged himself from the Eastman thenceforward, and he  left that summer, and now he is out of the tale.          CHAPTER III.     Of the Birth and Fostering of Helga the Fair.    This summer Thorstein got ready to ride to the Thing, and spake to  Jofrid his wife before he went from home. \"So is it,\" he says, \"that  thou art with child now, but thy child shall be cast forth if thou bear  a woman; but nourished if it be a man.\"    Now, at this time when all the land was heathen, it was somewhat the  wont of such men as had little wealth, and were like to have many young  children on their hands, to have them cast forth, but an evil deed it  was always deemed to be.    And now, when Thorstein had said this, Jofrid answers, \"This is a word  all unlike thee, such a man as thou art, and surely to a wealthy man  like thee it will not seem good that this should be done.\"    Thorstein answered: \"Thou knowest my mind, and that no good will hap if  my will be thwarted.\"    So he rode to the Thing; but while he was gone Jofrid gave birth to a  woman-child wondrous fair. The women would fain show her to the mother;  she said there was little need thereof, but had her shepherd Thorvard  called to her, and spake to him:--    \"Thou shalt take my horse and saddle it, and bring this child west  to Herdholt, to Thorgerd, Egil's daughter, and pray her to nourish it  secretly, so that Thorstein may not know thereof. For with such looks of  love do I behold this child, that surely I cannot bear to have it cast  forth. Here are three marks of silver, have them in reward of thy work;  but west there Thorgerd will get thee fare and food over the sea.\"    Then Thorvard did her bidding; he rode with the child to Herdholt, and  gave it into Thorgerd's hands, and she had it nourished at a tenant's of  hers who dwelt at Freedmans-stead up in Hvamfirth; but she got fare for  Thorvard north in Steingrims-firth, in Shell-creek, and gave him meet  outfit for his sea-faring: he went thence abroad, and is now out of the  story.    Now when Thorstein came home from the Thing, Jofrid told him that the  child had been cast forth according to his word, but that the herdsman  had fled away and stolen her horse. Thorstein said she had done well,  and got himself another herdsman. So six winters passed, and this matter  was nowise wotted of.    Now in those days Thorstein rode to Herdholt, being bidden there as  guest of his brother-in-law, Olaf Peacock, the son of Hoskuld, who was  then deemed to be the chief highest of worth among all men west there.  Good cheer was made Thorstein, as was like to be; and one day at the  feast it is said that Thorgerd sat in the high seat talking with her  brother Thorstein, while Olaf was talking to other men; but on the bench  right over against them sat three little maidens. Then said Thorgerd,--    \"How dost thou, brother, like the look of these three little maidens  sitting straight before us?\"    \"Right well,\" he answers, \"but one is by far the fairest; she has all  the goodliness of Olaf, but the whiteness and the countenance of us, the  Mere-men.\"    Thorgerd answered: \"Surely this is true, brother, wherein thou sayest  that she has the fairness and countenance of us Mere-folk, but  the goodliness of Olaf Peacock she has not"]]]
