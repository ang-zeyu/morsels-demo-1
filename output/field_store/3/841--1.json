[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#1)"],[1,"OF GEORGIA    By Joel Chandler Harris    Copyright, 1896, by American Book Company          PREFACE.    In preparing the pages that follow, the writer has had in view the  desirability of familiarizing the youth of Georgia with the salient  facts of the State's history in a way that shall make the further study  of that history a delight instead of a task. The ground has been gone  over before by various writers, but the narratives that are here retold,  and the characterizations that are here attempted, have not been brought  together heretofore. They lie wide apart in volumes that are little  known and out of print.    The stories and the characterizations have been grouped together so  as to form a series of connecting links in the rise and progress of  Georgia; yet it must not be forgotten that these links are themselves  connected with facts and events in the State's development that are  quite as interesting, and of as far-reaching importance, as those that  have been narrated here. Some such suggestion as this, it is hoped,  will cross the minds of young students, and lead them to investigate for  themselves the interesting intervals that lie between.    It is unfortunately true that there is no history of Georgia in which  the dry bones of facts have been clothed with the flesh and blood of  popular narrative. Colonel Charles C. Jones saw what was needed,  and entered upon the task of writing the history of the State with  characteristic enthusiasm. He had not proceeded far, however, when the  fact dawned upon his mind that such a work as he contemplated must be  for the most part a labor of love. He felt the influence of cold neglect  from every source that might have been expected to afford him aid and  encouragement. He was almost compelled to confine himself to a bare  recital of facts, for he had reason to know that, at the end of his  task, public inappreciation was awaiting him.    And yet it seems to the present writer that every person interested  in the growth and development of the republic should turn with eager  attention to a narrative embodying the events that have marked the  progress of Georgia. It was in this State that some of the most  surprising and spectacular scenes of the Revolution took place. In one  corner of Georgia those who were fighting for the independence of the  republic made their last desperate stand; and if they had surrendered to  the odds that faced them, the battle of King's Mountain would never have  been fought, Greene's southern campaign would have been crippled, and  the struggle for liberty in the south would have ended in smoke.    It is to illustrate the larger events that these stories have been  written; and while some of them may seem far away from this point of  view, they all have one common purpose and tend to one common end.          STORIES OF GEORGIA.          A SEARCH FOR TREASURE.    [Illustration: De Soto 014]    So far as written records tell us, Hernando de Soto and his companions  in arms were the first white men to enter and explore the territory now  known on the map as the State of Georgia. Tradition has small voice in  the matter, but such as it has tells another story. There are hints that  other white men ventured into this territory before De Soto and his men  beheld it. General Oglethorpe, when he came to Georgia with his gentle  colony, which had been tamed and sobered by misfortune and ill luck,  was firmly of the opinion that Sir Walter Raleigh, the famous soldier,  sailor, and scholar, had been there before him. So believing, the  founder of the Georgian Colony carried with him Sir Walter's diary. He  was confirmed in his opinion by a tradition, among the Indians of the  Yamacraw tribe, that Raleigh had landed where Savannah now stands.  There are also traditions in regard to the visits of other white men  to Georgia. These traditions may be true, or they may be the results  of dreams, but it is certain that De Soto and his picked company of  Spaniards were the first to march through the territory that is now  Georgia. The De Soto expedition was made up of the flower of Spanish  chivalry,--men Used to war, and fond of adventure. Some of them were  soldiers, anxious to win fame by feats of arms in a new land; some were  missionaries, professing an anxiety for the souls of such heathen as  they might encounter, but even these men were not unfamiliar with the  use of the sword; some were physicians, as ready to kill as to heal;  some were botanists, who knew as much about the rapier and the poniard  as they did about the stamens, pistils, and petals of the flowers;  and some were reporters, men selected to write the history of the  expedition. As it turned out, these reporters were entirely faithful  to their trust They told all that happened with a fidelity that  leaves nothing to be desired. The record they have left shows that the  expedition was bent on finding gold and other treasures.    On the 30th of May, 1539, De Soto's expedition landed at Tampa Bay,  Fla., and his men pitched their tents on the beach. The army was not  a large one; but it was made up of chosen men, who were used to the  dangers of war, and who, as stated before, were fond of adventure. There  was but one gray head in the expedition: therefore, though the army was  a small one, it was the most enthusiastic and warlike array that had  ever been seen in the New World. The soldiers wore rich armor, and  the cavalry rode gayly caparisoned horses. The army was accompanied by  slaves and mules to bear the burdens. It had artillery and other weapons  of war; handcuffs, neck collars, and chains for prisoners; crucibles for  refining gold; bloodhounds, greyhounds, and a drove of hogs.    For nearly a year the little army of De Soto wandered about in Florida,  ransacking the burying grounds of the Indians in search of treasures,  and committing such other depredations as were common to the  civilization of that age. When inquiries were made for gold, the  Indians always pointed toward the north; and, following these hints,  the expedition pursued its way through Florida, wandering about in the  swamps and slashes, but always held together by the enthusiasm of the  men and their hopes of securing rich spoils.    On the 3d of March, 1540, De Soto's army left Anhayca, which is said to  have been near the site of Tallahassee, and marched northward. Before  leaving the Spaniards seized from the Indians a large supply of maize  (now commonly known as corn), and appropriated whatever else struck  their fancy. They had spent some time with the Indians at this town of  Anhayca, and had sent out parties that committed depredations wherever  an Indian settlement could be found. They made slaves of many Indians,  treating them with more severity than they treated their beasts of  burden. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Indians, discovering the  greed of the Spaniards for gold, should have spread rumors that large  quantities of the yellow metal were to be found farther north.    Reports came to the Spaniards of a wonderful Indian queen who reigned  at a place called Yupaha, a settlement as large as a city. One day an  Indian boy, who had been brought to camp with other prisoners, told the  Spaniards a good deal about this great Indian queen. He said that she  ruled not only her own people, but all the neighboring chiefs, and as  far as the Indian settlements extended. The boy told the Spaniards that  all the Indians paid tribute to this great queen, and sent her fine  presents of clothing and gold. De Soto and his men cared nothing about  fine clothing. They were greedy only for gold and precious stones. They  asked the Indian boy many questions, and he answered them all. He  told how the gold was taken from the earth, and how it was melted and  refined. His description was so exact that the Spaniards no longer  had any doubt. Their spirits rose mightily, and, after robbing and  plundering the Indians who had fed and sheltered them during the winter  months, they broke up their camp and moved northward.    Four days after leaving Tallahassee, the Spaniards came to a deep river,  which Colonel C. C. Jones, jun., in his \"History of Georgia,\" says was  the Ocklockonnee, very close to the southwest boundary of Georgia. Two  days later they came to an Indian village from which the inhabitants  fled, but a little later a squad of five soldiers was set upon by the  Indians hiding near the encampment. One of the Spaniards was killed,  while three others were badly wounded. De Soto left this Indian village  on the 11th of March, and presently came to a piece of country which the  Spanish historian describes as a desert. But it was not a desert then,  and it is not a desert now. It was really a pine barren, such as may  be seen to this day in what is called the wire-grass region of southern  Georgia. In these barrens the soil is sandy and the land level,  stretching away for miles. De Soto and his men saw the primeval pines;  but these have long since disappeared, and their places are taken by  pines of a smaller growth. On the 21st of March, the Spaniards came to  the Ocmulgee River, near which they found an Indian town called Toalli.    There will always be a dispute about the route followed by De Soto in  his march. This dispute is interesting, but not important. Some say that  the expedition moved parallel with the coast until the Savannah River  was reached, at a point twenty-five miles below Augusta; but it is just  as probable that the route, after reaching the Ocmulgee, was along the  banks of that stream and in a northwesterly direction.    At Toalli the Indians had summer and winter houses to live in, and they  had storehouses for their maize. The women wore blankets or shawls made  of the fiber of silk grass, and the blankets were dyed vermilion or  black. Thenceforward the Indians whom the Spaniards met with were of a  higher order of intelligence, and of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24730"],[0,"Daniel Boone (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net              Daniel Boone      TAMING THE WILDS          by Katharine E.

At that time this country still belonged to England.    Friendly Indians often came out of the woods to visit the white men.  Daniel liked the Indians. He liked them so well that he wished he could  live with them.    One day he was taking care of his father's cattle. The pasture was  several miles from the settlement. Although Daniel was a ten-year-old  boy, he sometimes became lonely by himself.    Today he lay on a hillside and sang aloud. He wanted to hear a voice,  even if it was only his own.    There was a low laugh behind him. Daniel sprang to his feet. A tall,  slim Indian boy stood a few feet away. The white boy liked him at once.    \"I sing, too,\" the young Indian said.    He threw back his head and sang. Daniel could not understand a word.    \"I sing to the sun and the wind and the rain,\" the boy explained.    \"I like your Indian song,\" Daniel said, \"but I'm glad you speak  English.\"    The boy patted the bow that hung over his right shoulder. \"You like  this?\"    The bow was strong and shining. Daniel ran a finger along the smooth  wood.    \"I like it very much,\" he said.    The other boy took an arrow and placed it on the bowstring. He pulled  back the bow. The arrow flew away.    \"You get,\" the Indian said.    Daniel ran after the arrow. He picked it up and looked back. The Indian  boy was right beside him.    He took the arrow from Daniel. Again he shot it. Again the white boy  ran after it. The young Indian ran beside him.    He shook his head when Daniel handed him the arrow.    He handed Daniel the bow.    \"Shoot!\" he said.    Daniel took the bow in his hands. He pulled it back and let the arrow  fly.    By now Daniel had forgotten the cattle. He had forgotten everything but  the wonderful bow, his new friend, and the wide, wild woods.    After a while the boys came to a high hill. At the bottom was an Indian  village. The brown-skinned boy took Daniel by the hand and ran toward  the settlement.    Several dogs barked at them. Some women were hoeing their gardens. They  hardly looked up as the boys passed.    An old woman was stirring something in an iron pot over a fire. It  smelled good. Daniel remembered that he had eaten nothing since  breakfast.    His friend stopped and pointed to Daniel and himself. The old woman  nodded. With a sharp stick, she lifted a piece of meat from the pot.    The Indian boy took a broad leaf from a near-by bush. The woman dropped  the hot meat on it.    Now Daniel knew what to do. He, too, found a leaf. The woman gave him  some meat. Soon the hungry boys had finished their lunch.    That afternoon they swam in the clear, broad river. Then they lay on  the bank in the sunshine. Daniel had never been so happy. However, he  knew he must soon go home. His mother would worry if he did not return  before dark.    \"I must go now. I must drive the cows home,\" he told his Indian friend.    The boy frowned. \"Women's work,\" he told Daniel.    Daniel laughed. \"It may be for the Indians, but it's not at the Boones'  house. I think I'd like being an Indian. An Indian boy has more fun  than a white boy.\"    \"There is much for an Indian to learn,\" the other told him. \"We must  learn to hunt, track animals, fish, and find our way in the  wilderness.\"    \"Those things are not work. They are fun,\" Daniel told him. \"I wish I  were an Indian. I believe I'd make a better Indian than a white boy.\"    When Daniel reached home at last, his mother scolded him.    \"You should not have gone off with that Indian boy. You can't trust the  Indians,\" she told her son.    \"He was a good boy. I liked him,\" Daniel said.    His mother shook her head. \"Indians are not like us. We think  differently from them.\"    Daniel said nothing. But he thought his mother was mistaken.    \"_I believe I can think like an Indian_,\" he said to himself. \"_Except  for color, I'm more like an Indian than a white boy._\"          Moving On      Several years went by. Then Father Boone called the family together.  \"Pack your things,\" he told them. \"We are leaving here. Boones never  stay long in one place. Besides, our farm land is worn out. We can buy  rich land cheap to the southwest of here. We will settle there.\"    Sixteen-year-old Daniel was happy. \"I'm glad we are going,\" he said. \"I  feel crowded here. There are too many houses and too many people. And  the game is getting scarce.\"    Father Boone made ready for the journey. He got out the big wagon and  hitched two horses to it. Mother Boone packed clothes, quilts, dishes,  pots, pans, and kettles. She would fix food for the family along the  way. Daniel tied a cow behind the wagon.    The family said good-by to the neighbors and to their old home, and  started. Mother, the girls, and the little children rode in the wagon.  Father and the boys took turns riding the horses. Sometimes all of the  Boones walked so that the horses could rest. Father and the boys had  guns to kill birds and small animals for food along the way.    The Boones traveled across Pennsylvania. On and on they went toward the  new country. Daniel caught many rabbits, which his mother stewed. Once  he shot a small black bear. Another time he killed a deer. This gave  the Boones food for several days.    At last the family came to the rolling, green Yadkin Valley in North  Carolina. There were a few houses there already, but it was much wilder  than in Pennsylvania.    Father Boone said, \"This is good farming land. We will stop here.\"    Daniel looked all about him. There was level land close by. There were  woods not far away. And there were mountains in the west. Daniel knew  the hunting would be good.    \"I like this place,\" he said. \"There's plenty of room here.\"    Father Boone and the boys jumped off the horses. Mother Boone and the  girls climbed down from the wagon. They fed the horses and the cow.  They made a campfire. Father and the boys cut down trees and started to  build a log house. Soon the Boones had a new home in the new land.    The years went by. Daniel grew taller. His shoulders became wider. He  was fair-haired and blue-eyed, lean and rugged. He hunted in the woods  of the Yadkin Valley. He often brought home deer and bear. The Boones'  neighbors said that Daniel was the best shot for miles around. Daniel  Boone had grown up.          A Knock at the Door      When Daniel Boone was a young man, there was war between England and  France. England sent troops to fight against the French in America. The  French claimed the land west of the mountains. The English claimed the  same land. The Indians sided with the French.    Daniel Boone drove a supply wagon for the English and the Americans. He  made friends with another young wagoner named John Finley. Finley had  been to the land southwest of the mountains. Each night he and Boone  sat by the campfire and talked.    \"I've been deep in the wilderness they call Kentucky,\" Finley told  Boone. \"It is a wonderful place. The forests go on and on and on. There  are thousands of buffalo in Kentucky. There are deer, bear and small  animals, too. It is a great land for hunters.\"    \"I want to go there,\" Daniel said.    \"There are Indians in the wilderness,\" Finley told Daniel. \"They live  to the north of Kentucky and to the south of Kentucky. They call the  land their hunting ground. They do not like the white men to go there.\"    \"There should be room enough for both Indians and white men,\" Daniel  Boone replied. He thought for a while. \"Some day I am going to  Kentucky.\"    When Daniel went back home to the Yadkin Valley, he married a tall,  dark-haired girl named Rebecca Bryan. Sometimes he liked to tease her.  One summer day before they married he was sitting beside her under a  big tree. Suddenly he took his broad-bladed knife and cut a long slit  in her fresh white apron.    \"Why did you"]]]
