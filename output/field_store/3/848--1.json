It was  somewhat cooler up the creek than out on the main body of water, for  the tall birches and willows, crowding down to the brim, threw cool,  green shadows across it and shut out the scorching glare, while a  stray breeze now and then rippled down the wooded slopes, rustling the  beech leaves with an airy, pleasant sound.    Out in the pond the glassy water creamed and shimmered in the hot sun,  unrippled by the faintest breath of air. Across the soft, pearly tints  of the horizon blurred the smoke of the big factory chimneys that were  owned by Mr. Walters, to whom the pond and adjacent property also  belonged.    Mr. Walters was a comparative stranger in Carleton, having but  recently purchased the factories from the heirs of the previous owner;  but he had been in charge long enough to establish a reputation for  sternness and inflexibility in all his business dealings.    One or two of his employees, who had been discharged by him on what  they deemed insufficient grounds, helped to deepen the impression that  he was an unjust and arbitrary man, merciless to all offenders, and  intolerant of the slightest infringement of his cast-iron rules.    Dan Phillips had been on the pond ever since sunrise. The trout had  risen well in the early morning, but as the day wore on, growing  hotter and hotter, they refused to bite, and for half an hour Dan had  not caught one.    He had a goodly string of them already, however, and he surveyed them  with satisfaction as he rowed his leaky little skiff to the shore of  the creek.    \"Pretty good catch,\" he soliloquized. \"Best I've had this summer, so  far. That big spotted one must weigh near a pound. He's a beauty.  They're a good price over at the hotels now, too. I'll go home and  get my dinner and go straight over with them. That'll leave me time  for another try at them about sunset. Whew, how hot it is! I must take  Ella May home a bunch of them blue flags. They're real handsome!\"    He tied his skiff under the crowding alders, gathered a big bunch of  the purple flag lilies with their silky petals, and started homeward,  whistling cheerily as he stepped briskly along the fern-carpeted wood  path that wound up the hill under the beeches and firs.    He was a freckled, sunburned lad of thirteen years. His neighbours all  said that Danny was \"as smart as a steel trap,\" and immediately added  that they wondered where he got his smartness from--certainly not from  his father!    The elder Phillips had been denominated \"shiftless and slack-twisted\"  by all who ever had any dealings with him in his unlucky, aimless  life--one of those improvident, easygoing souls who sit contentedly  down to breakfast with a very faint idea where their dinner is to come  from.    When he had died, no one had missed him, unless it were his patient,  sad-eyed wife, who bravely faced her hard lot, and toiled  unremittingly to keep a home for her two children--Dan and a girl two  years younger, who was a helpless cripple, suffering from some form of  spinal disease.    Dan, who was old and steady for his years, had gone manfully to work  to assist his mother. Though he had been disappointed in all his  efforts to obtain steady employment, he was active and obliging, and  earned many a small amount by odd jobs around the village, and by  helping the Carleton farmers in planting and harvest.    For the last two years, however, his most profitable source of summer  income had been the trout pond. The former owner had allowed anyone  who wished to fish in his pond, and Dan made a regular business of it,  selling his trout at the big hotels over at Mosquito Lake. This, in  spite of its unattractive name, was a popular summer resort, and Dan  always found a ready market for his catch.    When Mr. Walters purchased the property it somehow never occurred to  Dan that the new owner might not be so complaisant as his predecessor  in the matter of the best trouting pond in the country.    To be sure, Dan often wondered why it was the pond was so deserted  this summer. He could not recall having seen a single person on it  save himself. Still, it did not cross his mind that there could be any  particular reason for this.    He always fished up in the cool, dim creeks, which long experience had  taught him were best for trout, and came and went by a convenient wood  path; but he had no thought of concealment in so doing. He would not  have cared had all Carleton seen him.    He had done very well with his fish so far, and prices for trout at  the Lake went up every day. Dan was an enterprising boy, and a general  favourite with the hotel owners. They knew that he could always be  depended on.    Mrs. Phillips met him at the door when he reached home.    \"See, Mother,\" said Dan exultantly, as he held up his fish. \"Just look  at that fellow, will you? A pound if he's an ounce! I ought to get a  good price for these, I can tell you. Let me have my dinner now, and  I'll go right over to the Lake with them.\"    \"It's a long walk for you, Danny,\" replied his mother pityingly, \"and  it's too hot to go so far. I'm afraid you'll get sun-struck or  something. You'd better wait till the cool of the evening. You're  looking real pale and thin this while back.\"    \"Oh, I'm all right, Mother,\" assured Dan cheerfully. \"I don't mind the  heat a bit. A fellow must put up with some inconveniences. Wait till I  bring home the money for these fish. And I mean to have another catch  tonight. It's you that's looking tired. I wish you didn't have to work  so hard, Mother. If I could only get a good place you could take it  easier. Sam French says that Mr. Walters wants a boy up there at the  factory, but I know I wouldn't do. I ain't big enough. Perhaps  something will turn up soon though. When our ship comes in, Mother,  we'll have our good times.\"    He picked up his flags and went into the little room where his sister  lay.    \"See what I've brought you, Ella May!\" he said, as he thrust the cool,  moist clusters into her thin, eager hands. \"Did you ever see such  beauties?\"    \"Oh, Dan, how lovely they are! Thank you ever so much! If you are  going over to the Lake this afternoon, will you please call at Mrs.  Henny's and get those nutmeg geranium slips she promised me? Just look  how nice my others are growing. The pink one is going to bloom.\"    \"I'll bring you all the geranium slips at the Lake, if you like. When  I get rich, Ella May, I'll build you a big conservatory, and I'll get  every flower in the world in it for you. You shall just live and sleep  among posies. Is dinner ready, Mother? Trouting's hungry work, I tell  you. What paper is this?\"    He picked up a folded newspaper from the table.    \"Oh, that's only an old Lake _Advertiser_,\" answered Mrs. Phillips, as  she placed the potatoes on the table and wiped her moist, hot face  with the corner of her gingham apron. \"Letty Mills brought it in  around a parcel this morning. It's four weeks old, but I kept it to  read if I ever get time. It's so seldom we see a paper of any kind  nowadays. But I haven't looked at it yet. Why, Danny, what on earth is  the matter?\"    For Dan, who had opened the paper and glanced over the first page,  suddenly gave a choked exclamation and turned pale, staring stupidly  at the sheet before him.    \"See, Mother,\" he gasped, as she came up in alarm and looked over his  shoulder. This is what they read:        Notice        Anyone found fishing on my pond at Carleton"]]]
