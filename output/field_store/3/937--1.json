Y.          Foreword      My travels in search of light on the \"Animals at Home\" have taken me up  and down the Rocky Mountains for nearly thirty years. In the canyons  from British Columbia to Mexico, I have lighted my campfire, far beyond  the bounds of law and order, at times, and yet I have found no place  more rewarding than the Yellowstone Park, the great mountain haven of  wild life.    Whenever travellers penetrate into remote regions where human hunters  are unknown, they find the wild things half tame, little afraid of man,  and inclined to stare curiously from a distance of a few paces. But very  soon they learn that man is their most dangerous enemy, and fly from him  as soon as he is seen. It takes a long time and much restraint to win  back their confidence.    In the early days of the West, when game abounded and when fifty yards  was the extreme deadly range of the hunter's weapons, wild creatures  were comparatively tame. The advent of the rifle and of the lawless  skin hunter soon turned all big game into fugitives of excessive shyness  and wariness. One glimpse of a man half a mile off, or a whiff of him on  the breeze, was enough to make a Mountain Ram or a Wolf run for miles,  though formerly these creatures would have gazed serenely from a point  but a hundred yards removed.    The establishment of the Yellowstone Park in 1872 was the beginning of a  new era of protection for wild life; and, by slow degrees, a different  attitude in these animals toward us. In this Reservation, and nowhere  else at present in the northwest, the wild things are not only abundant,  but they have resumed their traditional Garden-of-Eden attitude toward  man.    They come out in the daylight, they are harmless, and they are not  afraid at one's approach. Truly this is ideal, a paradise for the  naturalist and the camera hunter.    The region first won fame for its Canyon, its Cataracts and its Geysers,  but I think its animal life has attracted more travellers than even the  landscape beauties. I know it was solely the joy of being among the  animals that led me to spend all one summer and part of another season  in the Wonderland of the West.    My adventures in making these studies among the fourfoots have been very  small adventures indeed; the thrillers are few and far between. Any one  can go and have the same or better experiences to-day. But I give them  as they happened, and if they furnish no ground for hair-lifting  emotions, they will at least show what I was after and how I went.    I have aimed to show something of the little aspects of the creatures'  lives, which are those that the ordinary traveller will see; I go with  him indeed, pointing out my friends as they chance to pass, adding a few  comments that should make for a better acquaintance on all sides. And I  have offered glimpses, wherever possible, of the wild thing in its home,  embodying in these chapters the substance of many lectures given under  the same title as this book.    The cover design is by my wife, Grace Gallatin Seton. She was with me in  most of the experiences narrated and had a larger share in every part of  the work than might be inferred from the mere text.

JEWISH LITERATURE    AND OTHER ESSAYS    JEWISH LITERATURE    AND    OTHER ESSAYS    BY    GUSTAV KARPELES    PHILADELPHIA THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA 1895    Copyright 1895, by  THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA    Press of  The Friedenwald Co.  Baltimore          PREFACE      The following essays were delivered during the last ten years, in the  form of addresses, before the largest associations in the great cities  of Germany. Each one is a dear and precious possession to me. As I once  more pass them in review, reminiscences fill my mind of solemn occasions  and impressive scenes, of excellent men and charming women. I feel as  though I were sending the best beloved children of my fancy out into the  world, and sadness seizes me when I realize that they no longer belong  to me alone--that they have become the property of strangers. The living  word falling upon the ear of the listener is one thing; quite another  the word staring from the cold, printed page. Will my thoughts be  accorded the same friendly welcome that greeted them when first they  were uttered?    I venture to hope that they may be kindly received; for these addresses  were born of devoted love to Judaism. The consciousness that Israel is  charged with a great historical mission, not yet accomplished, ushered  them into existence. Truth and sincerity stood sponsor to every word. Is  it presumptuous, then, to hope that they may find favor in the New  World? Brethren of my faith live there as here; our ancient watchword,  \"Sh'ma Yisrael,\" resounds in their synagogues as in ours; the old  blood-stained flag, with its sublime inscription, \"The Lord is my  banner!\" floats over them; and Jewish hearts in America are loyal like  ours, and sustained by steadfast faith in the Messianic time when our  hopes and ideals, our aims and dreams, will be realized. There is but  one Judaism the world over, by the Jordan and the Tagus as by the  Vistula and the Mississippi. God bless and protect it, and lead it to  the goal of its glorious future!    To all Jewish hearts beyond the ocean, in free America, fraternal  greetings!    GUSTAV KARPELES    BERLIN, Pesach 5652/1892.          CONTENTS      A GLANCE AT JEWISH LITERATURE    THE TALMUD    THE JEW IN THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION    WOMEN IN JEWISH LITERATURE    MOSES MAIMONIDES    JEWISH TROUBADOURS AND MINNESINGERS    HUMOR AND LOVE IN JEWISH POETRY    THE JEWISH STAGE    THE JEW'S QUEST IN AFRICA    A JEWISH KING IN POLAND    JEWISH SOCIETY IN THE TIME OF MENDELSSOHN    LEOPOLD ZUNZ    HEINRICH HEINE AND JUDAISM    THE MUSIC OF THE SYNAGOGUE          A GLANCE AT JEWISH LITERATURE      In a well-known passage of the _Romanzero_, rebuking Jewish women for  their ignorance of the magnificent golden age of their nation's poetry,  Heine used unmeasured terms of condemnation. He was too severe, for the  sources from which he drew his own information were of a purely  scientific character, necessarily unintelligible to the ordinary reader.  The first truly popular presentation of the whole of Jewish literature  was made only a few years ago, and could not have existed in Heine's  time, as the most valuable treasures of that literature, a veritable  Hebrew Pompeii, have been unearthed from the mould and rubbish of the  libraries within this century. Investigations of the history of Jewish  literature have been possible, then, only during the last fifty years.    But in the course of this half-century, conscientious research has so  actively been prosecuted that we can now gain at least a bird's-eye view  of the whole course of our literature. Some stretches still lie in  shadow, and it is not astonishing that eminent scholars continue to  maintain that \"there is no such thing as an organic history, a logical  development, of the gigantic neo-Hebraic literature\"; while such as are  acquainted with the results of late research at best concede that  Hebrew literature has been permitted to garner a \"tender aftermath.\"  Both verdicts are untrue and unfair. Jewish literature has developed  organically, and in the course of its evolution it has had its  spring-tide as well as its season of decay, this again followed by  vigorous rejuvenescence.    Such opinions are part and parcel of the vicissitudes of our literature,  in themselves sufficient matter for an interesting book. Strange it  certainly is that a people without a home, without a land, living under  repression and persecution, could produce so great a literature;  stranger still, that it should at first have been preserved and  disseminated, then forgotten, or treated with the disdain of prejudice,  and finally roused from torpid slumber into robust life by the breath of  the modern era. In the neighborhood of twenty-two thousand works are  known to us now. Fifty years ago bibliographers were ignorant of the  existence of half of these, and in the libraries of Italy, England, and  Germany an untold number awaits resurrection.    In fact, our literature has not yet been given a name that recommends  itself to universal acceptance. Some have called it \"Rabbinical  Literature,\" because during the middle ages every Jew of learning bore  the title Rabbi; others, \"Neo-Hebraic\"; and a third party considers it  purely theological. These names are all inadequate. Perhaps the only one  sufficiently comprehensive is \"Jewish Literature.\" That embraces, as it  should, the aggregate of writings produced by Jews from the earliest  days of their history up to the present time, regardless of form, of  language, and, in the middle ages at least, of subject-matter.    With this definition in mind, we are able to sketch the whole course of  our literature, though in the frame of an essay only in outline. We  shall learn, as Leopold Zunz, the Humboldt of Jewish science, well says,  that it is \"intimately bound up with the culture of the ancient world,  with the origin and development of Christianity, and with the scientific  endeavors of the middle ages. Inasmuch as it shares the intellectual  aspirations of the past and the present, their conflicts and their  reverses, it is supplementary to general literature. Its peculiar  features, themselves falling under universal laws, are in turn helpful  in the interpretation of general characteristics. If the aggregate  results of mankind's intellectual activity can be likened unto a sea,  Jewish literature is one of the tributaries that feed it. Like other  literatures and like literature in general, it reveals to the student  what noble ideals the soul of man has cherished, and striven to realize,  and discloses the varied achievements of man's intellectual powers. If  we of to-day are the witnesses and the offspring of an eternal, creative  principle, then, in turn, the present is but the beginning of a future,  that is, the translation of knowledge into life. Spiritual ideals  consciously held by any portion of mankind lend freedom to thought,  grace to feeling, and by sailing up this one stream we may reach the  fountain-head whence have emanated all spiritual forces, and about  which, as a fixed pole, all spiritual currents eddy.\"[1]    The cornerstone of this Jewish literature is the Bible, or what we call  Old Testament literature--the oldest and at the same time the most  important of Jewish writings. It extends over the period ending with the  second century before the common era; is written, for the most part, in  Hebrew, and is the clearest and the most faithful reflection of the  original characteristics of the Jewish people. This biblical literature  has engaged the closest attention of all nations and every age. Until  the seventeenth century, biblical science was purely dogmatic, and only  since Herder pointed the way have its aesthetic elements been dwelt upon  along with, often in defiance of, dogmatic considerations. Up to this  time, Ernest Meier and Theodor Noeldeke have been the only ones to treat  of the Old Testament with reference to its place in the history of  literature.    Despite the dogmatic air clinging to the critical introductions to the  study of the Old Testament, their authors have not shrunk from treating  the book sacred to two religions with childish arbitrariness. Since the  days of Spinoza's essay at rationalistic explanation, Bible criticism  has been the wrestling-ground of the most extravagant exegesis, of bold  hypotheses, and hazardous conjectures. No Latin or Greek classic has  been so ruthlessly attacked and dissected; no mediaeval poetry so  arbitrarily interpreted. As a natural consequence, the aesthetic  elements were more and more pushed into the background. Only recently  have we begun to ridicule this craze for hypotheses, and returned to  more sober methods of inquiry. Bible criticism reached the climax of  absurdity, and the scorn was just which greeted one of the most  important works of the critical school, Hitzig's \"Explanation of the  Psalms.\" A reviewer said: \"We may entertain the fond hope that, in a  second edition of this clever writer's commentary, he will be in the  enviable position to tell us the day and the hour when each psalm was  composed.\"    The reaction began a few years ago with the recognition of the  inadequacy of Astruc's document hypothesis, until then the creed of all  Bible critics. Astruc, a celebrated French physician, in 1753 advanced  the theory that the Pentateuch--the five books of Moses--consists of two  parallel documents, called respectively Yahvistic and Elohistic, from  the name applied to God in each. On this basis, German science after him  raised a superstructure. No date was deemed too late to be assigned to  the composition of the Pentateuch. If the historian Flavius Josephus had  not existed, and if Jesus had not spoken of \"the Law\" and \"the  prophets,\" "]]]
