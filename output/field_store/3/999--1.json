I'm not sure what may happen.\"    \"Neither am I, but I'm ready for it. If it does explode it can't do  much damage.\"    \"Oh, I hope it doesn't explode. We've had so much trouble with the  airship, I trust nothing goes wrong now.\"    \"Well, turn on the gas, Mr. Sharp,\" advised Tom Swift. \"I'll watch the  pressure gauge, and, if it goes too high, I'll warn you, and you can  shut it off.\"    The man nodded, and, with a small wrench in his hand, went to one end  of the tank. The youth, looking anxiously at him, turned his gaze now  and then toward a gauge, somewhat like those on steam boilers, which  gauge was attached to an aluminum, cigar-shaped affair, about five feet  long.    Presently there was a hissing sound in the small frame building where  the two were conducting an experiment which meant much to them. The  hissing grew louder.    \"Be ready to jump,\" advised Mr. Sharp.    \"I will,\" answered the lad. \"But the pressure is going up very slowly.  Maybe you'd better turn on more gas.\"    \"I will. Here she goes! Look out now. You can't tell what is going to  happen.\"    With a sudden hiss, as the powerful gas, under pressure, passed from  the tank, through the pipes, and into the aluminum container, the hand  on the gauge swept past figure after figure on the dial.    \"Shut it off!\" cried Tom quickly. \"It's coming too fast! Shut her off!\"    The man sprang to obey the command, and, with nervous fingers, sought  to fit the wrench over the nipple of the controlling valve. Then his  face seemed to turn white with fear.    \"I can't move it!\" Mr. Sharp yelled. \"It's jammed! I can't shut off the  gas! Run! Look out! She'll explode!\"    Tom Swift, the young inventor, whose acquaintance some of you have  previously made, gave one look at the gauge, and seeing that the  pressure was steadily mounting, endeavored to reach, and open, a  stop-cock, that he might relieve the strain. One trial showed him that  the valve there had jammed too, and catching up a roll of blue prints  the lad made a dash for the door of the shop. He was not a second  behind his companion, and hardly had they passed out of the structure  before there was a loud explosion which shook the building, and  shattered all the windows in it.    Pieces of wood, bits of metal, and a cloud of sawdust and shavings flew  out of the door after the man and the youth, and this was followed by a  cloud of yellowish smoke.    \"Are you hurt, Tom?\" cried Mr. Sharp, as he swung around to look back  at the place where the hazardous experiment had been conducted.    \"Not a bit! How about you?\"    \"I'm all right. But it was touch and go! Good thing you had the gauge  on or we'd never have known when to run. Well, we've made another  failure of it,\" and the man spoke somewhat bitterly.    \"Never mind, Mr. Sharp,\" went on Tom Swift. \"I think it will be the  last mistake. I see what the trouble is now; and know how to remedy it.  Come on back, and we'll try it again; that is if the tank hasn't blown  up.\"    \"No, I guess that's all right. It was the aluminum container that went  up, and that's so light it didn't do much damage. But we'd better wait  until some of those fumes escape. They're not healthy to breathe.\"    The cloud of yellowish smoke was slowly rolling away, and the man and  lad were approaching the shop, which, in spite of the explosion that  had taken place in it, was still intact, when an aged man, coming from  a handsome house not far off, called out, \"Tom, is anyone hurt?\"    \"No, dad. We're all right.\"    \"What happened?\"    \"Well, we had another explosion. We can't seem to get the right mixture  of the gas, but I think we've had the last of our bad luck.  We're  going to try it again. Up to now the gas has been too strong, the tank  too weak, or else our valve control is bad.\"    \"Oh dear, Mr. Swift! Do tell them to be careful!\" a woman's voice  chimed in. \"I'm sure something dreadful will happen! This is about the  tenth time something has blown up around here, and--\"    \"It's only the ninth, Mrs. Baggert,\" interrupted Tom, somewhat  indignantly.    \"Well, goodness me! Isn't nine almost as bad as ten? There I was, just  putting my bread in the oven,\" went on Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper,  \"and I was so startled that I dropped it, and now the dough is all over  the kitchen floor. I never saw such a mess.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" answered the youth, trying not to laugh. \"We'll see that  it doesn't happen again.\"    \"Yes; that's what you always say,\" rejoined the motherly-looking woman,  who looked after the interests of Mr. Swift's home.    \"Well, we mean it this time,\" retorted the lad. \"We see where our  mistake was; don't we. Mr. Sharp?\"    \"I think so,\" replied the other seriously.    \"Come on back, and we'll see what damage was done,\" proposed Tom.  \"Maybe we can rig up another container, mix some fresh gas, and make  the final experiment this afternoon.\"    \"Now do be careful,\" cautioned Mr. Swift, the aged inventor, once more.  \"I'm afraid you two have set too hard a task for yourselves this time.\"    \"No we haven't, dad,\" answered his son. \"You'll see us yet skimming  along above the clouds.\"    \"Humph! If you go above the clouds I shan't be very likely to see you.  But go slowly, now. Don't blow the place up again.\"    Mr. Swift went into the house, followed by Mrs. Baggert, who was loudly  bewailing the fate of her bread. Tom and Mr. Sharp started toward the  shop where they had been working. It was one of several buildings,  built for experimental purposes and patent work by Mr. Swift, near his  home.    \"It didn't do so very much damage,\" observed Tom, as he peered in  through a window, void of all the panes of glass. \"We can start right  in.\"    \"Hold on! Wait! Don't try it now!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp, who talked in  short, snappy sentences, which, however, said all he meant. \"The fumes  of that gas aren't good to breathe. Wait, until they have blown away.  It won't be long. It's safer.\"    He began to cough, choking from the pungent odor, and Tom felt an  unpleasant tickling sensation in his throat.    \"Take a walk around,\" advised Mr. Sharp. \"I'll be looking over the blue  prints. Let's have 'em.\"    Tom handed over the roll he had grabbed up when he ran from the shop,  just before the explosion took place, and, while his companion spread  them out on his knee, as he sat on an upturned barrel, the lad walked  toward the rear of the large yard. It was enclosed by a high board  fence, with a locked gate, but Tom, undoing the fastenings, stepped out  into a broad, green meadow at the rear of his father's property.  As he  did so he saw three boys running toward him.    \"Hello!\" exclaimed our hero. \"There are Andy Foger, Sam Snedecker and  Pete Bailey. I wonder what they're heading this way for?\"    On the trio came, increasing their pace as they caught sight of Tom.  Andy Foger, a red-haired and squint-eyed lad, a sort of town bully,  with a rich and indulgent father, was the first to reach the young  inventor.    \"How--how many are killed?\" panted Andy.    \"Shall we go for doctors?\" asked Sam.    \"Can we see the place?\" blurted out Pete, and he had to sit down on the  grass, he was so winded.    \"Killed? Doctors?\" repeated Tom, clearly much puzzled. \"What are you  fellows driving at, anyhow?\"    \"Wasn't there a lot of people killed in the explosion we heard?\"  demanded Andy, in eager tones.    \"Not a one,\" replied Tom.    \"There was an explosion!\" exclaimed Pete. \"We heard it, and you can't  fool us!\"    \"And we saw the smoke,\" added Snedecker.    \"Yes, there was a small explosion,\" admitted Tom, with a smile, \"but no  one was killed; or even hurt. We don't have such things happen in our  shops.\"    \"Nobody killed?\" repeated Andy questioningly, and the disappointment  was evident in his tones.    \"Nobody hurt?\" added Sam, his crony, and he, too, showed his chagrin.    \"All our run for nothing,\" continued Pete, another crony, in disgust.    \"What happened?\" demanded the red-haired lad, as if he had a right to  know. \"We were walking along the lake road, and we heard an awful  racket. If the police come out here, you'll have to tell what it was,  Tom Swift.\" He spoke defiantly.    \"I've no objection to telling you or the police,\" replied Tom. \"There  was an explosion. My friend, Mr. Sharp, the balloonist, and I were  conducting an experiment with a new kind of gas, and it was too strong,  that's all. An aluminum container blew up, but no particular damage was  done. I hope you're satisfied.\"    \"Humph! What you making, anyhow?\" demanded Andy, and again he spoke as  if he had a right to know.    \"I don't know that it's any of your business,\" Tom came back at him  sharply, \"but, as everyone will soon know, I may as well tell you.  We're building an airship.\"    \"An airship?\" exclaimed Sam and Pete in one breath.    \"An airship?\" queried Andy, and there was a sneer in his voice. \"Well,  I don't think you can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30066"],[0,"Laboratory Manual of Glass-Blowing (#1)"],[1,"at https://www.pgdp.net.

PREFACE      The purpose of this little book is to provide a clear and detailed  discussion of the elements of glass-blowing. Many laboratories in this  country, especially in the west, are located a long way from any  professional glass-blower, and the time and money spent in shipping  broken apparatus several hundred miles to be mended could often be saved  if some of the laboratory force could seal on a new stopcock, replace a  broken tube, or make some temporary repairs. Many men in physical or  chemical laboratories have occasion to modify some piece of apparatus  designed perhaps for other uses, or to design new apparatus. To such  also, the ability to perform some of the operations herein described may  be very valuable.    No originality is claimed for the methods here described. They are those  which the author has found most suitable and convenient in his own work,  and most easily learned by students. The aim has been to describe each  operation in such detail that a beginner can follow the process without  help and, with practice, attain satisfactory results. It is, however,  much easier to perform any of the operations described, after seeing  some one else perform it correctly; since the temperature, the exact  time to begin blowing the glass, and many other little details are very  difficult to obtain from a description.    It has not been thought worth while to describe the process of making  stopcocks, thermometers, vacuum tubes, etc., as such things can be  purchased more cheaply and of much better quality than any amateur can  make unless he is willing to spend a very large amount of time in  practice. For similar reasons the manipulation of quartz glass has been  omitted.    The author will be grateful for all suggestions and criticisms tending  to improve the methods presented. If some of them appear to be given in  excessive detail, the reader will remember that many things which are  obvious to the experienced worker are not so to the beginner, and that  it is the little details in the manipulation which often spell success  or failure in glass-blowing.

As is well known, there are two  general varieties of glass: Lead glass and soda glass. Formerly much  apparatus was made of lead glass, but at present it is very seldom met  with, except in the little drops of special glass used to seal platinum  wires into the larger sizes of tubes. Lead glass is softer and more  readily fusible than soda glass, but has the disagreeable property of  growing black in a few seconds unless worked in a strong oxidizing  flame. This may be prevented by using a \"hissing\" flame, with a large  excess of air, and working in the extreme end of the flame; or the black  lead formed may thus be reoxidized, and the glass restored to its  original clearness.    Almost all the soft glass on the market is a soda glass, although  sometimes part of the soda is replaced by potash. Most of the hard glass  appears to be a potash glass. The following qualities are desirable in a  glass for ordinary working: (1) moderately low working temperature, (2)  freedom from air bubbles, striations and irregularities, (3) proper  composition, so that the glass will not devitrify or crystallize while  being handled at its working temperature, (4) ability to withstand rapid  heating without cracking.    The working temperature of different samples of so-called \"soft glass\"  varies a good deal, and is best determined by trial. The glass should  become almost soft enough for blowing in a flame that still shows a  little yellow near the tip, so that at the highest temperature of the  flame it may flow fairly freely and thus easily eliminate irregularities  in thickness. If the glass is too hard, the shrinking of the glass,  collection of material for a bulb, and in fact most of the working  processes will be slower, and the glass will not stay at its working  temperature long enough after its removal from the flame to permit it to  be properly blown.    Air bubbles in the original batch of glass are drawn out into long  hair-like tubes during the process of manufacture. When such tubing is  worked, the walls of these microscopic tubes collapse in spots, and the  air thus enclosed will often collect as a small bubble in the wall, thus  weakening it. Irregularities are of various kinds. Some of the larger  sizes of thin-walled tubing often have one half of their walls much  thicker than the other, and such tubing should only be used for the  simplest work. Some tubing has occasional knots or lumps of unfused  material. The rest of the tube is usually all right, but often the  defective part must be cut out. The presence of striations running along  the tube is generally an indication of hard, inferior glass. Crookedness  and non-uniformity of diameter are troublesome only when long pieces  must be used.    Devitrification is one of the worst faults glass can possibly have. It  is especially common in old glass, and in glass which has contained  acids. It seems to be of two sorts. One variety manifests itself on the  surface of the glass before it reaches its working temperature, but if  the glass be heated to the highest temperature of the flame it will  disappear except in the portion at the edge of the heated part. The  glass seems to work all right, but an ugly crystallized ring is left at  the edge of the portion heated. This kind appears most frequently in old  glass which was originally of good quality, but has in time been  superficially altered, probably by the loss of alkalies. The other  variety of devitrification does not appear when the glass is first  heated; but after it has been maintained at or above its working  temperature for a longer or shorter time, it will be noticed that the  outer surface has lost its smoothness, and appears to be covered with  minute wrinkles. It will also be found that the glass has become harder,  so that it becomes impossible to work it easily. Further heating only  makes the matter worse, as does the use of a higher temperature from the  start. In fact it will often be found that a piece of comparatively soft  glass which devitrifies almost at once in a \"hissing\" flame can be  worked without serious difficulty if care be taken to use a flame still  decidedly tinged with yellow. Even good glass will begin to devitrify in  this way if heated too long at the highest temperature of the flame, so  care should always be taken (1) _to reduce the time of heating of any  spot of glass to a minimum_; _i.e._, get the desired result at the first  attempt, if possible, or at least with the minimum of reheating and  \"doctoring,\" and (2) _avoid keeping the glass at the highest temperature  of the flame any longer than necessary_. This may be accomplished by  doing all heating, shrinking, etc., of the glass in a flame more or less  tinged with yellow, and only raising the temperature to the highest  point when ready to blow the glass. This kind of devitrification is  apparently due to volatilization of the alkalies from the glass in the  flame, and it is said that it can be partly remedied or prevented by  holding a swab of cotton saturated with a strong solution of common salt  in the flame from time to time as the glass is heated.    The toughness of glass, _i.e._, its ability to withstand variations of  temperature, depends on its"]]]
