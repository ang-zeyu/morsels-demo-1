[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#1)"],[1,"Dyke, by George Manville Fenn.    ________________________________________________________________________  A most authentic-seeming book about the difficulties a pair of young  Britons faced when they went to South Africa, and set up an ostrich farm  in the dry and largely empty veldt.  They had a married couple of the  locals to help them, and of these the man wasn't much use.  They also  had a most sagacious dog, who figures largely in the story.  One of the  enemies they had to face was lions.    One day they found they needed more stores, so young Dyke, barely  sixteen years of age, has to go on a six or seven day journey to the  farm of the nearest honest storekeeper, a fat old German, seventy years  of age.  On the way back there is a serious delay due to a flash flood  which took several days to clear.  But when they get back they find that  the older brother is seriously ill of an African fever.  The local  people had been sure he would die, and were preparing to move in and  take what stock there was.  But young Dyke nurses his brother back to  health.  A little later the old German turns up at the farm, and makes a  discovery which would change the fortunes of the brothers for ever.    A very gripping story in the best Fenn style, very hard to put down.  It  makes an excellent audiobook, of about seven hours' duration.    ________________________________________________________________________  DIAMOND DYKE, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.        CHAPTER ONE.    QUERY BAD SHILLINGS?    \"Hi!\"    No answer.    \"Hi!  Dyke!\"    The lad addressed did not turn his head, but walked straight on, with  the dwarf karroo bushes crackling and snapping under his feet, while at  each call he gave an angry kick out, sending the dry red sand flying.    He was making for the kopje or head of bald granite which rose high out  of the level plain--where, save in patches, there was hardly a tree to  be seen--for amongst these piled-up masses of glittering stone, lay deep  moist crevices in which were shade and trickling water, the great  blessings of a dry and thirsty desert.    \"Hi!  Do you hear, Dyke?\" came again, shouted by a big athletic-looking  young man, in flannels and a broad-brimmed Panama hat, and he gave his  thick brown beard an angry tug as he spoke.    \"Oh yes, I hear,\" muttered the lad; \"I can hear you, old Joe.  He's got  away again, and I shan't come.  A stupid-headed, vicious, long-legged  beast, that's what he is.\"    \"Hi!\" roared the young man, as he stood in front of an ugly corrugated  iron shed, dignified by the name of house, from which the white-wash,  laid thickly over the grey zinc galvanising to ward off the rays of the  blinding Afric sun, had peeled away here and there in patches.    Some attempts had been made to take off the square, desolate ugliness of  the building by planting a patch of garden surrounded by posts and wire;  but they were not very successful, for, as a rule, things would not grow  for want of water.    Vandyke Emson--the Dyke shouted at--had been the gardener, and so long  as he toiled hard, fetching water from the granite kopje springs, a  quarter of a mile away, and tended the roots he put in the virgin soil,  they rushed up out of the ground; but, as he reasonably said, he  couldn't do everything, and if he omitted to play Aquarius for  twenty-four hours, there were the plants that looked so flourishing  yesterday shrivelled to nothing.  He had planted creepers to run all  over the sides and roof, but the sun made the corrugated iron red hot--  the boy's exaggerated figure of speech, but so hot that you could not  keep your hand upon the roof or wall--and the creepers found the  temperature too much for their constitution, and they rapidly turned to  hay.  Then he trained up tomatoes, which grew at express speed so long  as they were watered, formed splendid fruit, were left to themselves a  couple of days, and then followed suit with the creepers.  Joseph Emson  smiled behind his great beard, and said they were a success because the  tomatoes were cooked ready for use; but Dyke said it was another  failure, because they were just as good raw, and he did not like to eat  his fruit as vegetables cooked in a frying-pan covered with white-wash.    Still all was not bare, for a patch of great sunflowers found moisture  enough for their roots somewhere far below, and sent up their great  pithy stalks close to the house door, spread their rough leaves, and  imitated the sun's disk in their broad, round, yellow flowers.  There  was an ugly euphorbia too, with its thorny, almost leafless branches and  brilliant scarlet flowers; while grotesque and hideous-looking, with its  great, flat, oblong, biscuit-shaped patches of juicy leaf, studded with  great thorns, a prickly pear or opuntia reared itself against the end  gable, warranted to stop every one who approached.    \"It's no good,\" Dyke once said; \"the place is a nasty old desert, and I  hate it, and I wish I'd never come.  There's only six letters in Africa,  and half of them spell fry.\"    \"And that's bad grammar and bad spelling,\" said his half-brother; \"and  you're a discontented young cub.\"    \"And you're another,\" said Dyke sourly.  \"Well, haven't we been fried or  grilled ever since we've been out here? and don't you say yourself that  it's all a failure, and that you've made a big mistake?\"    \"Yes, sometimes, when I'm very hot and tired, Dicky, my lad.  We've  failed so far; but, look here, my brave and beautiful British boy.\"    \"Look here, Joe; I wish you wouldn't be so jolly fond of chaffing and  teasing me,\" said Dyke angrily.    \"Poor old fellow, then!  Was um hot and tired and thirsty, then?\" cried  his half-brother mockingly.  \"Take it coolly, Dicky.\"    \"Don't call me Dicky,\" cried the boy passionately, as he kicked out both  legs.    \"Vandyke Emson, Esquire, ostrich-farmer, then,\" said the other.    \"Ostrich-farmer!\" cried Dyke, in a tone full of disgust.  \"Ugh!  I'm  sick of the silly-looking, lanky goblins.  I wish their heads were  buried in the sand, and their bodies too.\"    \"With their legs sticking straight up to make fences, eh, old man?\" said  Joseph Emson, smiling behind his beard--a smile that would have been all  lost, if it had not been for a pleasant wrinkle or two about his frank  blue eyes.    \"Well, they would be some good then,\" said Dyke, a little more amiably.  \"These wire fences are always breaking down and going off _spang_, and  twisting round your legs.  Oh, I do wish I was back at home.\"    \"Amongst the rain and clouds and fog, so that you could be always  playing cricket in summer, and football in winter, and skating when  there was ice.\"    \"Don't you sneer at the fog, Joe,\" retorted Dyke.  \"I wish I could see a  good thick one now.\"    \"So that you could say, `Ah, you should see the veldt where the sun  shines brightly for weeks together.'\"    \"Sun shines!\" cried Dyke.  \"Here, look at my face and hands.\"    \"Yes; they're burnt of good Russia leather colour, like mine, Dyke.  Well, what do you say?  Shall we pack the wagon, give it up, and trek  slowly back to Cape Town?\"    \"Yes, I'm ready!\" cried the boy eagerly.    \"Get out, you confounded young fibber!  I know you better than that.\"    \"No, you don't,\" said Dyke sulkily.    \"Yes, I do, Dicky.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're  not of that breed, my boy.  You've got too much of the old dad's  Berserker blood in your veins.  Oh, come, now: withdraw all that!  British boys don't look back when they've taken hold of the plough  handles.\"    \"Bother the plough handles!\"    \"By all means, boy; but, I say, that isn't English, Dyke.  Where would  our country's greatness have been if her sons had been ready to sing  that coward's song?\"    \"Now you're beginning to preach again, Joe,\" said the boy sulkily.    \"Then say `Thank you,' my lad.  Isn't it a fine thing for you to have a  brother with you, and then, when there isn't a church for hundreds of  miles--a brother who can preach to you?\"    \"No; because I know what you're going to say--that we ought to go on and  fight it out.\"    \"That's it, Dicky.  Didn't some one say that the beauty of a British  soldier was that he never knew when he was beaten?\"    \"I'm not a soldier, and I am beaten,\" cried Dyke sourly.    \"Not you.  I know you better.  Why, if I said `Yes; let's give it up,'  and packed up all we cared to take, and got the wagon loaded to-night,  you'd repent in the morning when we were ready to start, and say, `Let's  have another try.'\"    \"Well, perhaps I might say--\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Joseph Emson; \"what a young humbug you are, Dicky.  Fancy you going back with me to the old dad, and us saying, `Here we  are, back again, like two bad shillings, father.  We've spent all our  money, and we're a pair of failures.'\"    \"Well, but it is so hot and tiresome, and the ostriches are such  horribly stupid beasts, and--\"    \"We're both very tired, and disappointed, and thirsty, and--\"    \"I am, you mean,\" said Dyke.  \"Nothing ever seems to worry you.\"    \"Hah!  I know you, Dicky, better than you know me.  I feel as keenly as  you do, boy.  No: we will not give up.  We haven't given the ostriches a  fair trial yet.\"    \"Oh, haven't we!\"    \"No; not half.  I know we've had terribly bad luck just lately.  We did  begin well.\"    \"No: it has all been a dreary muddle, and I'm sick of it.\"    \"Yes, you often are of a night, Dyke; but after a night's rest you are  ready enough to go on again in a right spirit.  No, my lad, we'll never  say die.\"    \"Who wants to!  I want to have a try at something else.  Let's go and  hunt and get lion and leopard skins, and fill the wagon, and bring them  back and sell them.\"    \"Plenty of people are doing that, Dicky.\"    \"Well then, let's go after ivory; shoot elephants, and bring back a load  to sell.  It's worth lots of money.\"    \"Plenty of people are doing that too, boy.\"    \"Oh, you won't try, Joe, and that's what makes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                             [Illustration: Midnight Pool: Animals Drinking]                           HEATH SUPPLEMENTARY READERS                                    THE WONDERS OF                                  THE JUNGLE                                 PRINCE SARATH GHOSH                                     BOOK ONE                                     D.

C. HEATH & CO.           *       *       *       *       *          PREFACE      One of the great thinkers of the world has said that all the sciences  are embodied in natural history. Hence natural history should be  taught to a child from an early age.    Perhaps the best method of teaching it is to set forth the  characteristics of animals in the form of a narrative. Then the child  reads the narrative with pleasure and almost as a story, not as a  tedious \"lesson.\"    I have followed that method in the Wonders of the Jungle. The present  work (Book One) is intended to be a supplementary reader for the  earlier grades in grammar schools. If it be found useful, I shall  write one or two more books in progressive order for the use of higher  grades.    In Book One I have depicted only such wild animals as appeal to the  interest of young children, and even to their sympathy and love. In  subsequent books I shall describe the animals that prey upon others.  As those animals are not lovable, it would be better for the child to  read about them a year or two later. But even to those animals I shall  be just, and shall depict their good qualities as well as their  preying habits. How many people know that the very worst animal, the  tiger, is a better husband and father than many men? Or that the  ferocity of the tigress is prompted entirely by her maternal  instinct--and that in every case of unusual ferocity yet recorded it  was afterward found that there was a helpless cub somewhere near?  Hence in subsequent books I shall enter more fully into the causes of  animal instincts and characteristics--their loves and their hates and  their fears.    Regarding the scheme of Book One, the animals are described in their  daily life, and the main scientific facts and principles concerning  each animal are woven into the narrative as a part of that daily life.  But while teaching science to the child in that pleasant form, a few  other purposes have also been kept in view:--    1. To cultivate the child's imagination. True imagination is the  ability to visualize mentally the realities of life, not what is  unreal--for which it is so often mistaken. Hence in this book the  child is helped to visualize the animals in their actual haunts, and  to see each incident as it actually happens.    2. To cultivate the child's reasoning faculty. The child is encouraged  at every step to think and to reason why the animal does certain  things; _e.g._ why the elephant does not drink directly with its  mouth, but has to squirt the water into it with the trunk.    3. To teach a moral from the study of animals. The whole of Creation  is one immense and beautiful pattern: so the child may well be trained  to see the pattern in this also. And as a practical benefit from the  study of animals, the child may learn thereby the value of certain  qualities, such as obedience, discipline, and good citizenship--_e.g._  as in the remarkable case of the elephant, the buffalo, and the  flamingo, as described in the text. In this regard I have kept in mind  the very useful suggestions formulated a few years ago by the Moral  Education League of Great Britain, under the patronage of Queen Mary,  five of whose children at that time ranged in age from seven to  fifteen. One of the functions of education is to present to the child  the noblest and the most elevated of ideals. I have sought to do that  in almost every chapter.    I have to acknowledge my obligation to the New York Kindergarten  Association for its valuable cooperation in putting this book through  a practical test. The Kindergarten Association on more than one  occasion provided me with a large audience of children, ranging in age  from six to nine, ex-pupils of the Association, who are now in the  public schools.

You  have seen many animals in the zoo or in a circus--elephants, bears,  lions, tigers, leopards, and many others. But the jungle is the place  where these animals live before they are brought to the zoo or the  circus.    In fact, _jungle_ really means a _wild place_; that is, a place where  trees and bushes grow quite wild, so that men never cut down the trees  or clear away the bushes. That is the natural home for all sorts of  animals.    Now I am going to tell you about the wonderful way in which they live  there with their families, as we do in our homes; for the Papas and  Mammas among the animals are just as fond of their children as ours  are. So you must _imagine_ that you are going into the jungle with  me, so that I can show you everything. You see, it is just like a game  of _pretending_, that we are going to play.    There is actually a place in the jungle where you can see all the  animals at once. In fact, that place is so wonderful that King George  and Queen Mary of England went to see it; that was a few years ago,  when they went to India, which is a far-away country. For in India  there is a huge jungle where many thousands of animals live.    So you must _pretend_ that I am taking you to the Royal party, and  that you are sitting with the King and Queen and all the fine men and  lovely ladies; and we are watching the animals, while I tell you all  about them.    First, I must tell you that it is midnight, and all the animals are  coming to a stream of water to drink. This stream is a river about  twice as wide as a large street in your home town. We are sitting on  the bank, on one side of the stream; and the animals are coming to  drink on the bank on the other side.    \"But,\" you may say, \"will not the animals see us across the stream,  and get frightened and run away?\"    That is quite true. But the King and Queen had thought of that. So  they ordered a lot of men to put a large net on their side of the  stream, just in front of them, and then to cover the net with twigs  and leaves so cleverly that the animals thought the leaves were a part  of the jungle, and did not see the people on the other side of the  net.    So the King and Queen, and you and I, can peep quietly through the  leaves and watch the animals. Almost all wild animals drink at  midnight; so we shall see them now.    Where will the animals come from? You see the stream before us; well,  on the other side of it is the jungle, where the animals live. Right  in front of us we see a gap in the jungle close to the bank. That gap  was made by _elephants_ by beating down the bushes with their feet.  They made it long ago to come to the water, and now they use"]]]
