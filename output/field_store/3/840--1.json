It may not be amiss to remark, in explanation of the startling and  sensational title chosen for this production, that logic has not yet  succeeded in framing a title-page which shall clearly indicate the  nature of a book. The greatest adepts have frequently taken refuge in  some fortuitous word, which has served their purpose better than the  best results of their analysis. So it was in the present case. \"DANGER!\"  is a thrilling and warning word, suggestive of the locomotive headlight,  and especially applicable to the subject matter of the following pages,  in which the crimes of a great city are dissected and exposed from the  arcanum or confessional of what we may be pardoned for designating the  best-known criminal law offices in America.    So much for the title. A few words as to the _motif_ of the publication.  Despite the efficiency of our police and the activity of our many  admirable reforming and reclaiming systems, crime still abounds, while  the great tide of social impurity continues to roll on with unabated  velocity. Optimists and philanthropic dreamers in every age have  pictured in glowing colors the gradual but sure approach of the  millennium, yet we are, apparently, still as far from that elysium of  purity and unselfishness as ever. Whenever the wolf and the lamb lie  down together, the innocent bleater is invariably inside the other's  ravenous maw. There may be--and we have reason to know that there is--a  marked diminution in certain forms of crime, but there are others in  which surprising fertility of resource and ingenuity of method but too  plainly evince that the latest developments of science and skill are  being successfully pressed into the service of the modern criminal.  Increase of education and scientific skill not only confers superior  facilities for the successful perpetration of crime, but also for its  concealment. The revelations of the newspapers, from week to week, but  too plainly indicate an undercurrent of vice and iniquity, whose depth  and foulness defy all computation.    We are not in accord with those pessimists who speak of New York as a  boiling caldron of crime, without any redeeming features or hopeful  elements. But our practice in the courts and our association with  criminals of every kind, and the knowledge consequently gained of their  history and antecedents, have demonstrated that, in a great city like  New York, the germs of evil in human life are developed into the rankest  maturity. As the eloquent Dr. Guthrie, in his great work, \"The City, its  Sins and its Sorrows,\" remarks: \"Great cities many have found to be  great curses. It had been well for many an honest lad and unsuspecting  country girl that hopes of higher wages and opportunities of fortune,  that the gay attire and gilded story of some acquaintance, had never  turned their steps cityward, nor turned them from the simplicity and  safety of their country home. Many a foot that once lightly pressed the  heather or brushed the dewy grass has wearily trodden in darkness, guilt  and remorse, on these city pavements. Happy had it been for many had  they never exchanged the starry skies for the lamps of the town, nor had  left their quiet villages for the throng and roar of the big city's  streets. Weil for them had they heard no roar but the river's, whose  winter flood it had been safer to breast; no roar but ocean's, whose  stormiest waves it had been safer to ride, than encounter the flood of  city temptations, which has wrecked their virtue and swept them into  ruin.\"    By hoisting the DANGER signal at the mast-head, as it were, we have  attempted to warn young men and young women--the future fathers and  mothers of America--against the snares and pitfalls of the crime and the  vice that await the unwary in New York. Our own long and extensive  practice at the bar has furnished most of the facts; some, again, are on  file in our criminal courts of record; and some, as has already been  hinted, have been derived from the confidential revelations of our  private office. With the desire that this book shall prove a useful  warning and potent monitor to those for whose benefit and instruction it  has been designed, and in the earnest hope that, by its influence, some  few may be saved from prison, penitentiary, lunatic asylum, or suicides'  purgatory, it is now submitted to the intelligent readers of America,    By the public's obedient servants,  HOWE & HUMMEL.

I, William F. Howe, founder of the law firm of Howe & Hummel,  was born in Shawmut street, in Boston, Mass., on the seventh day of  July, 1828. My father was the Rev. Samuel Howe, M. A., a rather  well-known and popular Episcopal clergyman at the Hub in those days. Our  family removed to England when I was yet very young, and consequently my  earliest recollections are of London. I remember going to school, where  I speedily developed a genius for mischief and for getting into scrapes.  I received a liberal allowance of the floggings then fashionable, and I  can recall the _hwhish_ of the implement of torture to this day.

CHAPTER I.    ANCIENT PAINTING, FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE CHRISTIAN ERA.      In speaking of art we often contrast the useful or mechanical arts with  the Fine Arts; by these terms we denote the difference between the arts  which are used in making such things as are necessary and useful in  civilized life, and the arts by which ornamental and beautiful things are  made.    The fine arts are Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Poetry, and Music,  and though we could live if none of these existed, yet life would be far  from the pleasant experience that it is often made to be through the  enjoyment of these arts.    In speaking of Painting, just here I wish to include the more general idea  of pictures of various sorts, and it seems to me that while picture-making  belongs to the fine or beautiful arts, it is now made a very useful art in  many ways. For example, when a school-book is illustrated, how much more  easily we understand the subject we are studying through the help we get  from pictures of objects or places that we have not seen, and yet wish to  know about. Pictures of natural scenery bring all countries before our  eyes in such a way that by looking at them, while reading books of travel,  we may know a great deal more about lands we have never seen, and may  never be able to visit.    Who does not love pictures? and what a pleasure it is to open a magazine  or book filled with fine illustrations. St. Augustine, who wrote in the  fourth century after Christ, said that \"pictures are the books of the  simple or unlearned;\" this is just as true now as then, and we should  regard pictures as one of the most agreeable means of education. Thus one  of the uses of pictures is that they give us a clear idea of what we have  not seen; a second use is that they excite our imaginations, and often  help us to forget disagreeable circumstances and unpleasant surroundings.  The cultivation of the imagination is very important, because in this way  we can add much to our individual happiness. Through this power, if we are  in a dark, narrow street, in a house which is not to our liking, or in the  midst of any unpleasant happenings, we are able to fix our thoughts upon a  photograph or picture that may be there, and by studying it we are able to  imagine ourselves far, far away, in some spot where nature makes  everything pleasant and soothes us into forgetfulness of all that can  disturb our happiness. Many an invalid--many an unfortunate one is thus  made content by pictures during hours that would otherwise be wretched.  This is the result of cultivating the perceptive and imaginative  faculties, and when once this is done, we have a source of pleasure within  ourselves and not dependent on others which can never be taken from us.
