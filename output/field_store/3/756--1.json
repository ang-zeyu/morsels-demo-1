Right Honourable, and Right Worshipful, I have not only been an  eye-witness, but interested by my attendance; so as that I may  justly acknowledge those Triumphs and magnificent Trophies of  Cookery that have adorned your Tables; nor can I but confess to the  world, except I should be Guilty of the highest Ingratitude, that  the only structure of this my Art and knowledge, I owed to your  costs, generous and inimitable Epences; thus not only I have derived  my experience, but your Country hath reapt the Plenty of your  Humanity and charitable Bounties.    Right Honourable, and Right Worshipful, Hospitality which was once a  Relique of the Gentry, and a known Cognizance to all ancient Houses,  hath lost her Title through the unhappy and Cruel Disturbances of  these Times, she is now reposing of her lately so alarmed Head on  your beds of Honour: In the mean space that our English World may  know the _Mecaena_'s and Patrons of this Generous Art, I have exposed  this Volume to the Publick, under the Tuition of your Names; at  whose Feet I prostrate these Endeavours, and shall for ever remain      _Your most humble devoted Servant._     _ROBERT MAY._      _From _Soleby_ in _Leicestershire_,      September 29. 1684._            _To the Master Cooks, and to such young Practitioners      of the Art of Cookery, to whom this Book may be useful._    To you first, most worthy Artists, I acknowledg one of the chief  Motives that made me to adventure this Volume to your Censures, hath  been to testifie my gratitude to your experienced Society; nor could  I omit to direct it to you, as it hath been my ambition, that you  should be sensible of my Proficiency of Endeavours in this Art. To  all honest well intending Men of our Profession, or others, this  Book cannot but be acceptable, as it plainly and profitably  discovers the _Mystery_ of the _whole Art_; for which, though I may  be _envied by some that only value their private Interests above  Posterity, and the publick good_, yet God and my own Conscience  would not permit me _to bury these my Experiences with my Silver  Hairs in the Grave_: and that more especially, as the advantages of  my Education hath raised me above the _Ambitions_ of others, in the  converse I have had with other _Nations_, who in this _Art_ fall  short of what I _have known experimented by you my worthy Country  men_. Howsoever, the _French by their Insinuations, not without  enough of Ignorance_, have bewitcht some of the _Gallants of our  Nation_ with Epigram Dishes, smoakt rather than drest, so strangely  to captivate the _Gusto_, their _Mushroom'd Experiences_ for _Sauce_  rather than _Diet_, for the generality howsoever called _A-la-mode_,  not worthy of being taken notice on. As I live in _France_, and had  the Language and have been an eye-witness of their _Cookeries_ as  well, as a Peruser of their Manuscripts, and Printed _Authors_  whatsoever I found good in them, I have inserted in this _Volume_.  I do acknowledg my self not to be a little beholding to the  _Italian_ and _Spanish_ Treatises; though without my fosterage, and  bringing up under the _Generosities_ and _Bounties of my Noble  Patrons and Masters_, I could never have arrived to this  _Experience_. To be confined and limited to the narrowness of a  Purse, is to want the _Materials_ from which the _Artist_ must gain  his knowledge. Those _Honourable Persons_, _my Lord_ Lumley, and  others, with whom I have spent a part of my time, were such whose  generous cost never weighed the Expence, so that they might arrive  to that right and high esteem they had of their _Gusto's_. Whosoever  peruses this _Volume_ shall find it amply exemplified in _Dishes_ of  such high prices, which only these _Noblesses Hospitalities_ did  reach to: I should have sinned against their (to be perpetuated)  Bounties, if I had not set down their several varieties, that the  _Reader_ might be as well acquainted with what is extraordinary, as  what is ordinary in this _Art_; as I am truly sensible, that some of  those things that I have set down will amaze a not thorow-paced  _Reader_ in the _Art of Cookery_, as they are Delicates, never till  this time made known to the World.    _Fellow Cooks_, that I might give a testimony to my _Countrey_ of  the _laudableness of our Profession_, that I might encourage young  Undertakers to make a Progress in the _Practice of this Art_, I have  laid open these Experiences, as I was most unwilling to hide my  Talent, but have ever endeavoured to do good to others;  I acknowledge that there hath already been _several Books publisht_,  and amongst the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22799"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Ancient Egypt (#1)"],[1,"AT        MANY LANDS         ANCIENT EGYPT          [Illustration: PLATE 1.

But after Palestine, I think that  Egypt would come next. For one thing, it is linked very closely to  Palestine by all those beautiful stories of the Old Testament, which  tell us of Joseph, the slave-boy who became Viceroy of Egypt; of Moses,  the Hebrew child who became a Prince of Pharaoh's household; and of the  wonderful exodus of the Children of Israel.    But besides that, it is a land which has a most strange and wonderful  story of its own. No other country has so long a history of great Kings,  and wise men, and brave soldiers; and in no other country can you see  anything to compare with the great buildings, some of them most  beautiful, all of them most wonderful, of which Egypt has so many. We  have some old and interesting buildings in this country, and people go  far to see cathedrals and castles that are perhaps five or six hundred  years old, or even more; but in Egypt, buildings of that age are looked  upon as almost new, and nobody pays very much attention to them. For the  great temples and tombs of Egypt were, many of them, hundreds of years  old before the story of our Bible, properly speaking, begins.    The Pyramids, for instance, those huge piles that are still the wonder  of the world, were far older than any building now standing in Europe,  before Joseph was sold to be a slave in Potiphar's house. Hundreds upon  hundreds of years before anyone had ever heard of the Greeks and the  Romans, there were great Kings reigning in Egypt, sending out their  armies to conquer Syria and the Soudan, and their ships to explore the  unknown southern seas, and wise men were writing books which we can  still read. When Britain was a wild, unknown island, inhabited only by  savages as fierce and untaught as the South Sea Islanders, Egypt was a  great and highly civilized country, full of great cities, with noble  palaces and temples, and its people were wise and learned.    So in this little book I want to tell you something about this wonderful  and interesting old country, and about the kind of life that people  lived in it in those days of long ago, before most other lands had begun  to waken up, or to have any history at all. First of all, let us try to  get an idea of the land itself. It is a very remarkable thing that so  many of the countries which have played a great part in the history of  the world have been small countries. Our own Britain is not very big,  though it has had a great story. Palestine, which has done more than any  other country to make the world what it is to-day, was called \"the least  of all lands.\" Greece, whose influence comes, perhaps, next after that  of Palestine, is only a little hilly corner of Southern Europe. And  Egypt, too, is comparatively a small land.    It looks a fair size when you see it on the map; but you have to  remember that nearly all the land which is called Egypt on the map is  barren sandy desert, or wild rocky hill-country, where no one can live.  The real Egypt is just a narrow strip of land on either side of the  great River Nile, sometimes only a mile or two broad altogether, never  more than thirty miles broad, except near the mouth of the river, where  it widens out into the fan-shaped plain called the Delta. Someone has  compared Egypt to a lily with a crooked stem, and the comparison is very  true. The long winding valley of the Nile is the crooked stem of the  lily, and the Delta at the Nile mouth, with its wide stretch of fertile  soil, is the flower; while, just below the flower, there is a little  bud--a fertile valley called the Fayum.    Long before even Egyptian history begins, there was no bloom on the  lily. The Nile, a far bigger river then than it is now, ran into the sea  near Cairo, the modern capital of Egypt; and the land was nothing but  the narrow valley of the river, bordered on either side by desert hills.  But gradually, century by century, the Nile cut its way deeper down into  the land, leaving banks of soil on either side between itself and the  hills, and the mud which it brought down in its waters piled up at its  mouth and pressed the sea back, till, at last, the Delta was formed,  much as we see it now. This was long before Egypt had any story of its  own; but even after history begins the Delta was still partly marshy  land, not long reclaimed from the sea, and the real Egyptians of the  valley despised the people who lived there as mere marsh-dwellers. Even  after the Delta was formed, the whole country was only about twice as  large as Wales, and, though there was a great number of people in it for  its size, the population was only, at the most, about twice as great as  that of London.    An old Greek historian once said, \"Egypt is the gift of the Nile,\" and  it is perfectly true. We have seen how the great river made the country  to begin with, cutting out the narrow valley through the hills, and  building up the flat plain of the Delta. But the Nile has not only made  the country; it keeps it alive. You know that Egypt has always been one  of the most fertile lands in the world. Almost anything will grow there,  and it produces wonderful crops of corn and vegetables, and, nowadays,  of cotton. It was the same in old days. When Rome was the capital of the  world, she used to get most of the corn to feed her hungry thousands  from Egypt by the famous Alexandrian corn-ships; and you remember how,  in the Bible story, Joseph's brethren came down from Palestine because,  though there was famine there, there was \"corn in Egypt.\" And yet Egypt  is a land where rain is almost unknown. Sometimes there will come a  heavy thunder-shower; but for month after month, year in and year out,  there may be no rain at all.    How can a rainless country grow anything? The secret is the Nile. Every  year, when the rains fall in the great lake-basin of Central Africa,  from which one branch of the great river comes, and on the Abyssinian  hills, where the other branch rises, the Nile comes down in flood. All  the lower lands are covered, and a fresh deposit of Nile mud is left  upon them; and, though"]]]
