RUSSELL                             ALL RIGHTS RESERVED                     PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA          _The_ Printer's Foreword _to this_ Edition    I SPEAK TO THE READER; LET THE WRITER LISTEN        Oriental Proverb (_adapted_)      CALIFORNIA, by Dr. Josiah Royce, in the handsome as well as handy  American Commonwealths series, is commonly regarded as the best short  history of California ever written, and particularly so as to the early  mining era. Dr. Royce knew his state, and a more competent writer could  hardly have been selected. Reviewing, in his history, almost everything  accessible, worthy of consideration, in connection with mining-camps,  it is noteworthy that the Doctor has much to say concerning the Shirley  Letters. Thus (p. 344),--        Fortune has preserved to us from the pen of a very intelligent      woman, who writes under an assumed name, a marvelously skillful and      undoubtedly truthful history of a mining community during a brief      period, first of cheerful prosperity, and then of decay and      disorder. The wife of a physician, and herself a well-educated New      England woman, \"Dame Shirley,\" as she chooses to call herself, was      the right kind of witness to describe for us the social life of a      mining camp from actual experience. This she did in the form of      letters written on the spot to her own sister, and collected for      publication some two or three years later. Once for all, allowing      for the artistic defects inevitable in a disconnected series of      private letters, these \"Shirley\" letters form the best account of      an early mining camp that is known to me. For our real insight into      the mining life as it was, they are, of course, infinitely more      helpful to us than the perverse romanticism of a thousand such      tales as Mr. Bret Harte's, tales that, as the world knows, were not      the result of any personal experience of really primitive      conditions.    And in a foot-note on page 345 the Doctor says, in part,--        She is quite unconscious of the far-reaching moral and social      significance of much that she describes. Many of the incidents      introduced are such as imagination could of itself never suggest,      in such an order and connection. There is no mark of any conscious      seeking for dramatic effect. The moods that the writer expresses      indicate no remote purpose, but are the simple embodiment of the      thoughts of a sensitive mind, interested deeply in the wealth of      new experiences. The letters are charmingly unsentimental; the      style is sometimes a little stiff and provincial, but is on the      whole very readable.    No typographical or other changes are made in printing these extracts  from Dr. Royce's history, and as typographical style is involved in  noticing further the Doctor's review of the Shirley Letters, it is  proper to say here that his volume was printed at the Riverside Press,  Cambridge, Massachusetts,--a press that, in the words of a writer on  matters of typographical style, \"maintained the reputation of being one  of the three or four most painstaking establishments in the world.\"  Such places are few and far between, unlike the \"book and job printing  establishments\" that, like the poor, are always with us, and where no  _book_ was ever printed.    After having so fittingly introduced Shirley to his readers, it is  unfortunate that the Doctor is not always accurate in his citation of  the facts as printed in the Letters. Thus on page 347 of his history,  he says that the wife of the landlord of the Empire Hotel at Rich Bar  was \"yellow-complexioned and care-worn.\" She does not appear to have  been a care-worn person. Shirley says of her (post, p. 39),--        Mrs. B. is a gentle and amiable looking woman, about twenty-five      years of age. She is an example of the terrible wear and tear to      the complexion in crossing the plains, hers having become, through      exposure at that time, of a dark and permanent yellow, anything but      becoming. I will give you a key to her character, which will      exhibit it better than weeks of description. She took a nursing      babe, eight months old, from her bosom, and left it with two other      children, almost infants, to cross the plains in search of gold!    The Doctor says, \"The woman cooked for all the boarders herself,\" and  in the preceding sentence states, \"The baby, six months old, kicked and  cried in a champagne-basket cradle.\" Shirley does not use the word  \"boarders.\" The baby was only two weeks old. With the details of the  birth of this baby omitted, Shirley's account of these matters is (p.  40, post),--        When I arrived she was cooking supper for some half a dozen people,      while her really pretty boy, who lay kicking furiously in his      champagne-basket cradle, and screaming with a six-months-old-baby      power, had, that day, completed just two weeks of his earthly      pilgrimage.... He is an astonishingly large and strong child, holds      his head up like a six-monther, and has but one failing,--a too      evident and officious desire to inform everybody, far and near, at      all hours of the night and day, that his lungs are in a perfectly      sound and healthy condition.    Dr. Royce (p. 347) tells of the funeral of one of the four women  residing at Rich Bar at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],[0,"The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#1)"],[1,"was produced from scans of public domain material  produced by Microsoft for their Live Search Books site.)

The volumes of the first  series related the doings of these three Rover boys while attending  Putnam Hall Military Academy, Brill College, and while on numerous  outings.    Having acquired a good education, the three young men established  themselves in business and became married. Presently Dick Rover was  blessed with a son and a daughter, as was also his brother Sam, while  Tom Rover became the proud father of twin boys. At first the four lads  were kept at home, but then it was thought best to send them to a  boarding school, and in the first volume of the second series,  entitled \"The Rover Boys at Colby Hall,\" I related what happened to  them while attending this institution.    From Colby Hall the scene was shifted to Snowshoe Island, where the  lads went for a mid-winter outing. Here they ran into a most unusual  mystery, and helped an old lumberman to establish his claim to the  island.    In the present volume the boys are back at Colby Hall, but it is time  for the annual encampment of the military school, and soon they depart  for a brief season \"Under Canvas.\" This is at the time of the World  War, and the lads get mixed up in the mystery surrounding a wrecked  submarine. What this led to, I leave for the pages which follow to  relate.    In conclusion I wish to thank my numerous readers for all the nice  things they have said about my books. I trust the reading of the  volumes will do all of them good.        Affectionately and sincerely yours,      EDWARD STRATEMEYER.

Don't let him hit it!\"    \"Oh, dear, I do hope Jack scores!\" came in a sweet, girlish voice.    \"Of course he'll score!\" returned a youth sitting near the girl who  had made the remark. \"He's been holding back for just this chance.\"    \"Oh, do you think so?\" asked another girl in the grandstand.    \"Surest thing ever was,\" was the airy rejoinder. \"This is the time  we're going to show the Hixley boys what's what.\"    \"Not on your life!\" bellowed a heavy voice from the rear. \"Here is  where Colby Hall gets snowed under.\"    Then came a series of yells, followed by the tooting of horns and the  sounding of rattles, making a din that was almost ear-splitting.    The occasion was the annual baseball game between Hixley High and  Colby Hall. It had been scheduled to take place on the high-school  athletic field, but at almost the last minute this field had been  declared out of condition, and it had been decided to hold the contest  on the athletic grounds attached to the military academy.    Hixley High was very anxious to win this game. During the previous  fall, as related in a former volume of this series, the high-school  lads had lost the annual football game with Colby Hall by a single  touchdown. This defeat still rankled in their minds, and they were  determined if possible to take the baseball game by a score that  should be well worth while.    And they had good reason to be hopeful of doing this. While their  football team had always been considered by the other teams of that  locality to be of the \"second string variety,\" the baseball nine was a  remarkably strong organization. At its head was Dink Wilsey, a pitcher  who was destined at some time in the future to show himself in one of  the big leagues.    \"Why, Dink alone can walk off with that game,\" was the way more than  one Hixley High student had expressed himself.    But more than this--Hixley High had an exceptionally good first  baseman and a trio of outfielders whose batting average was high.    \"We're going to put it all over Colby Hall this trip,\" was the way the  manager of the Hixley High ball club declared himself on the day  previous to the match.    The game was now at the second half of the sixth inning, and the score  stood, Hixley High, 4; Colby Hall, 2. Colby Hall was at the bat with  two men out and one man at second.    It was therefore no wonder that the military academy students became  anxious when Jack Rover took up his bat and walked to the plate. A  home run would mean the tying of the score, and with a chance to do  even better.    \"Take your time, Jack,\" said Gif Garrison, who was the manager of the  nine. \"Make him give you a ball just where you want it.\"    \"Watch yourself!\" yelled one of the coaches to the runner at second,  for the Hixley High pitcher had suddenly whirled around, sending the  ball down to the second baseman. There was a quick drop by the runner,  and he escaped getting caught by a few inches only.    \"Close shave! Watch yourself, Dan!\" yelled Gif Garrison; and Dan  Soppinger, at second, nodded to show that he understood, and then  danced away in the direction of third base as before.    The first ball pitched to Jack Rover was a slow in-curve, and he  stepped back and allowed it to pass him.    \"Ball one!\"    At this decision a howl of delight went up from the followers of Colby  Hall, while a corresponding groan came from Hixley High.    \"That's the eye!\"    \"Better get a pair of glasses!\"    \"Sure! The umpire must be blind! That was a perfect ball!\"    \"Sure it was a perfect ball! That's the reason he called it a ball!\"  came from Andy Rover, who sat on the substitutes' bench.    The second ball delivered was a fairly good one, although rather low.  Jack swung at it, and high into the air spun the sphere, well back of  the catcher's head.    \"Foul!\"    \"Run,"]]]
