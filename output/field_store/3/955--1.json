[1]    By Flavius Josephus      Translated by William Whiston          BOOK 1.    1. I Suppose that by my books of the Antiquity of the Jews, most  excellent Epaphroditus, [2] have made it evident to those who peruse  them, that our Jewish nation is of very great antiquity, and had a  distinct subsistence of its own originally; as also, I have therein  declared how we came to inhabit this country wherein we now live. Those  Antiquities contain the history of five thousand years, and are taken  out of our sacred books, but are translated by me into the Greek tongue.  However, since I observe a considerable number of people giving ear to  the reproaches that are laid against us by those who bear ill-will to  us, and will not believe what I have written concerning the antiquity of  our nation, while they take it for a plain sign that our nation is of a  late date, because they are not so much as vouchsafed a bare mention by  the most famous historiographers among the Grecians. I therefore have  thought myself under an obligation to write somewhat briefly about  these subjects, in order to convict those that reproach us of spite and  voluntary falsehood, and to correct the ignorance of others, and withal  to instruct all those who are desirous of knowing the truth of what  great antiquity we really are. As for the witnesses whom I shall produce  for the proof of what I say, they shall be such as are esteemed to be  of the greatest reputation for truth, and the most skillful in the  knowledge of all antiquity by the Greeks themselves. I will also show,  that those who have written so reproachfully and falsely about us are  to be convicted by what they have written themselves to the contrary.  I shall also endeavor to give an account of the reasons why it hath so  happened, that there have not been a great number of Greeks who have  made mention of our nation in their histories. I will, however, bring  those Grecians to light who have not omitted such our history, for the  sake of those that either do not know them, or pretend not to know them  already.    2. And now, in the first place, I cannot but greatly wonder at those  men, who suppose that we must attend to none but Grecians, when we are  inquiring about the most ancient facts, and must inform ourselves of  their truth from them only, while we must not believe ourselves nor  other men; for I am convinced that the very reverse is the truth of the  case. I mean this,--if we will not be led by vain opinions, but will  make inquiry after truth from facts themselves; for they will find that  almost all which concerns the Greeks happened not long ago; nay, one may  say, is of yesterday only. I speak of the building of their cities, the  inventions of their arts, and the description of their laws; and as for  their care about the writing down of their histories, it is very near  the last thing they set about. However, they acknowledge themselves so  far, that they were the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, and the Phoenicians  (for I will not now reckon ourselves among them) that have preserved the  memorials of the most ancient and most lasting traditions of mankind;  for almost all these nations inhabit such countries as are least subject  to destruction from the world about them; and these also have taken  especial care to have nothing omitted of what was [remarkably] done  among them; but their history was esteemed sacred, and put into public  tables, as written by men of the greatest wisdom they had among  them. But as for the place where the Grecians inhabit, ten thousand  destructions have overtaken it, and blotted out the memory of former  actions; so that they were ever beginning a new way of living, and  supposed that every one of them was the origin of their new state. It  was also late, and with difficulty, that they came to know the letters  they now use; for those who would advance their use of these letters  to the greatest antiquity pretend that they learned them from the  Phoenicians and from Cadmus; yet is nobody able to demonstrate that they  have any writing preserved from that time, neither in their temples, nor  in any other public monuments. This appears, because the time when those  lived who went to the Trojan war, so many years afterward, is in great  doubt, and great inquiry is made, whether the Greeks used their letters  at that time; and the most prevailing opinion, and that nearest the  truth, is, that their present way of using those letters was unknown at  that time. However, there is not any writing which the Greeks agree to  be genuine among them ancienter than Homer's Poems, who must plainly he  confessed later than the siege of Troy; nay, the report goes, that  even he did not leave his poems in writing, but that their memory was  preserved in songs, and they were put together afterward, and that this  is the reason of such a number of variations as are found in them. [3]  As for those who set themselves about writing their histories, I mean  such as Cadmus of Miletus, and Acusilaus of Argos, and any others that  may be mentioned as succeeding Acusilaus, they lived but a little while  before the Persian expedition into Greece. But then for those that first  introduced philosophy, and the consideration of things celestial and  divine among them, such as Pherceydes the Syrian, and Pythagoras, and  Thales, all with one consent agree, that they learned what they knew  of the Egyptians and Chaldeans, and wrote but little And these are the  things which are supposed to be the oldest of all among the Greeks; and  they have much ado to believe that the writings ascribed to those men  are genuine.    3. How can it then be other than an absurd thing, for the Greeks to  be so proud, and to vaunt themselves to be the only people that are  acquainted with antiquity, and that have delivered the true accounts  of those early times after an accurate manner? Nay, who is there that  cannot easily gather from the Greek writers themselves, that they knew  but little on any good foundation when they set to write, but rather  wrote their histories from their own conjectures? Accordingly, they  confute one another in their own books to purpose, and are not ashamed.  to give us the most contradictory accounts of the same things; and I  should spend my time to little purpose, if I should pretend to teach  the Greeks that which they know better than I already, what a great  disagreement there is between Hellanicus and Acusilaus about their  genealogies; in how many eases Acusilaus corrects Hesiod: or after what  manner Ephorus demonstrates Hellanicus to have told lies in the greatest  part of his history; as does Timeus in like manner as to Ephorus, and  the succeeding writers do to Timeus, and all the later writers do to  Herodotus nor could Timeus agree with Antiochus and Philistius, or  with Callias, about the Sicilian History, no more than do the several  writers of the Athide follow one another about the Athenian affairs; nor  do the historians the like, that wrote the Argolics, about the affairs  of the Argives. And now what need I say any more about particular cities  and smaller places, while in the most approved writers of the expedition  of the Persians, and of the actions which were therein performed, there  are so great differences? Nay, Thucydides himself is accused of some as  writing what is false, although he seems to have given us the exactest  history of the affairs of his own time. [4]    4. As for the occasions of so great disagreement of theirs, there may  be assigned many that are very probable, if any have a mind to make an  inquiry about them; but I ascribe these contradictions chiefly to two  causes, which I will now mention, and still think what I shall mention  in the first place to be the principal of all. For if we remember that  in the beginning the Greeks had taken no care to have public records  of their several transactions preserved, this must for certain  have afforded those that would afterward write about those ancient  transactions the opportunity of making mistakes, and the power of making  lies also; for this original recording of such ancient transactions hath  not only been neglected by the other states of Greece, but even among  the Athenians themselves also, who pretend to be Aborigines, and to have  applied themselves to learning, there are no such records extant; nay,  they say themselves that the laws of Draco concerning murders, which  are now extant in writing, are the most ancient of their public records;  which Draco yet lived but a little before the tyrant Pisistratus. [5]  For as to the Arcadians, who make such boasts of their antiquity, what  need I speak of them in particular, since it was still later before they  got their letters, and learned them, and that with difficulty also. [6]    5. There must therefore naturally arise great differences among writers,  when they had no original records to lay for their foundation, which  might at once inform those who had an inclination to learn, and  contradict those that would tell lies. However, we are to suppose a  second occasion besides the former of these contradictions; it is  this: That those who were the most zealous to write history were not  solicitous for the discovery of truth, although it was very easy  for them always to make such a profession; but their business was to  demonstrate that they could write well, and make an impression upon  mankind thereby; and in what manner of writing they thought they were  able to exceed others, to that did they apply themselves, Some of them  betook themselves to the writing of fabulous narrations; some of them  endeavored to please the cities or the kings, by writing in their  commendation; others of them fell to finding faults with transactions,  or with the writers of such transactions, and thought to make a great  figure by so doing. And indeed these do what is of all things the most  contrary "]]]
