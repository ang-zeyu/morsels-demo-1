PIONEERS OF SCIENCE    [Illustration]    [Illustration: NEWTON    _From the picture by Kneller, 1689, now at Cambridge_]            PIONEERS OF SCIENCE      BY    OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.        PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS IN VICTORIA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LIVERPOOL      _WITH PORTRAITS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIONS_        London    MACMILLAN AND CO.    AND NEW YORK    1893      RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LIMITED,    LONDON AND BUNGAY.          PREFACE      This book takes its origin in a course of lectures on the history and  progress of Astronomy arranged for me in the year 1887 by three of my  colleagues (A.C.B., J.M., G.H.R.), one of whom gave the course its name.    The lectures having been found interesting, it was natural to write them  out in full and publish.    If I may claim for them any merit, I should say it consists in their  simple statement and explanation of scientific facts and laws. The  biographical details are compiled from all readily available sources,  there is no novelty or originality about them; though it is hoped that  there may be some vividness. I have simply tried to present a living  figure of each Pioneer in turn, and to trace his influence on the  progress of thought.    I am indebted to many biographers and writers, among others to Mr.  E.J.C. Morton, whose excellent set of lives published by the S.P.C.K.  saved me much trouble in the early part of the course.    As we approach recent times the subject grows more complex, and the men  more nearly contemporaries; hence the biographical aspect diminishes and  the scientific treatment becomes fuller, but in no case has it been  allowed to become technical and generally unreadable.    To the friends (C.C.C., F.W.H.M., E.F.R.) who with great kindness have  revised the proofs, and have indicated places where the facts could be  made more readily intelligible by a clearer statement, I express my  genuine gratitude.

But there still remained, deep-seated      in his century-old mind, the memory of his crime.    [Illustration: _Tom tripped on a wire and fell, with his ferocious  adversary on top._]      Two miles west of the village of Laketon there lived an aged recluse who  was known only as Old Crompton. As far back as the villagers could  remember he had visited the town regularly twice a month, each time  tottering his lonely way homeward with a load of provisions. He appeared  to be well supplied with funds, but purchased sparingly as became a  miserly hermit. And so vicious was his tongue that few cared to converse  with him, even the young hoodlums of the town hesitating to harass him  with the banter usually accorded the other bizarre characters of the  streets.    The oldest inhabitants knew nothing of his past history, and they had  long since lost their curiosity in the matter. He was a fixture, as was  the old town hall with its surrounding park. His lonely cabin was  shunned by all who chanced to pass along the old dirt road that led  through the woods to nowhere and was rarely used.    His only extravagance was in the matter of books, and the village book  store profited considerably by his purchases. But, at the instigation of  Cass Harmon, the bookseller, it was whispered about that Old Crompton  was a believer in the black art--that he had made a pact with the devil  himself and was leagued with him and his imps. For the books he bought  were strange ones; ancient volumes that Cass must needs order from New  York or Chicago and that cost as much as ten and even fifteen dollars a  copy; translations of the writings of the alchemists and astrologers and  philosophers of the dark ages.    It was no wonder Old Crompton was looked at askance by the simple-living  and deeply religious natives of the small Pennsylvania town.    But there came a day when the hermit was to have a neighbor, and the  town buzzed with excited speculation as to what would happen.           *       *       *       *       *    The property across the road from Old Crompton's hut belonged to Alton  Forsythe, Laketon's wealthiest resident--hundreds of acres of scrubby  woodland that he considered well nigh worthless. But Tom Forsythe, the  only son, had returned from college and his ambitions were of a nature  strange to his townspeople and utterly incomprehensible to his father.  Something vague about biology and chemical experiments and the like is  what he spoke of, and, when his parents objected on the grounds of  possible explosions and other weird accidents, he prevailed upon his  father to have a secluded laboratory built for him in the woods.    When the workmen started the small frame structure not a quarter of a  mile from his own hut, Old Crompton was furious. He raged and stormed,  but to no avail. Tom Forsythe had his heart set on the project and he  was somewhat of a successful debater himself. The fire that flashed from  his cold gray eyes matched that from the pale blue ones of the elderly  anchorite. And the law was on his side.    So the building was completed and Tom Forsythe moved in, bag and  baggage.    For more than a year the hermit studiously avoided his neighbor, though,  truth to tell, this required very little effort. For Tom Forsythe became  almost as much of a recluse as his predecessor, remaining indoors for  days at a time and visiting the home of his people scarcely oftener than  Old Crompton visited the village. He too became the target of village  gossip and his name was ere long linked with that of the old man in  similar animadversion. But he cared naught for the opinions of his  townspeople nor for the dark looks of suspicion that greeted him on his  rare appearances in the public places. His chosen work engrossed him so  deeply that all else counted for nothing. His parents remonstrated with  him in vain. Tom laughed away their recriminations and fears, continuing  with his labors more strenuously than ever. He never troubled his mind  over the nearness of Old Crompton's hut, the existence of which he  hardly noticed or considered.           *       *       *       *       *    It so happened one day that the old man's curiosity got the better of  him and Tom caught him prowling about on his property, peering  wonderingly at the many rabbit hutches, chicken coops, dove cotes and  the like which cluttered the space to the rear of the laboratory.    Seeing that he was discovered, the old man wrinkled his face into a  toothless grin of conciliation.    \"Just looking over your place, Forsythe,\" he said. \"Sorry about the fuss  I made when you built the house. But I'm an old man, you know, and  changes are unwelcome. Now I have forgotten my objections and would like  to be friends. Can we?\"    Tom peered searchingly into the flinty eyes that were set so deeply in  the wrinkled, leathery countenance. He suspected an ulterior motive, but  could not find it within him to turn the old fellow down.    \"Why--I guess so, Crompton,\" he hesitated: \"I have nothing against you,  but I came here for seclusion and I'll not have anyone bothering me in  my work.\"    \"I'll not bother you, young man. But I'm fond of pets and I see you have  many of them here; guinea pigs, chickens, pigeons, and rabbits. Would  you mind if I make friends with some of them?\"    \"They're not pets,\" answered Tom dryly, \"they are material for use in my  experiments. But you may amuse yourself with them if you wish.\"    \"You mean that you cut them up--kill them, perhaps?\"    \"Not that. But I sometimes"]]]
