This excitement was caused by the expected  arrival of a personage who had been much in people's mouths latterly in  Loudun, and about whom there was such difference of opinion that  discussion on the subject between those who were on his side and those  who were against him was carried on with true provincial acrimony. It  was easy to see, by the varied expressions on the faces of those who  turned the doorsteps into improvised debating clubs, how varied were the  feelings with which the man would be welcomed who had himself formally  announced to friends and enemies alike the exact date of his return.    About nine o'clock a kind of sympathetic vibration ran through the  crowd, and with the rapidity of a flash of lightning the words, \"There  he is! there he is!\" passed from group to group. At this cry some  withdrew into their houses and shut their doors and darkened their  windows, as if it were a day of public mourning, while others opened  them wide, as if to let joy enter. In a few moments the uproar and  confusion evoked by the news was succeeded by the deep silence of  breathless curiosity.    Then, through the silence, a figure advanced, carrying a branch of  laurel in one hand as a token of triumph. It was that of a young man of  from thirty-two to thirty-four years of age, with a graceful and  well-knit frame, an aristocratic air and faultlessly beautiful features  of a somewhat haughty expression. Although he had walked three leagues  to reach the town, the ecclesiastical garb which he wore was not only  elegant but of dainty freshness. His eyes turned to heaven, and singing  in a sweet voice praise to the Lord, he passed through the streets  leading to the church in the market-place with a slow and solemn gait,  without vouchsafing a look, a word, or a gesture to anyone. The entire  crowd, falling into step, marched behind him as he advanced, singing  like him, the singers being the prettiest girls in Loudun, for we have  forgotten to say that the crowd consisted almost entirely of women.    Meanwhile the object of all this commotion arrived at length at the  porch of the church of Saint-Pierre. Ascending the steps, he knelt at  the top and prayed in a low voice, then rising he touched the church  doors with his laurel branch, and they opened wide as if by magic,  revealing the choir decorated and illuminated as if for one of the four  great feasts of the year, and with all its scholars, choir boys,  singers, beadles, and vergers in their places. Glancing around, he for  whom they were waiting came up the nave, passed through the choir, knelt  for a second time at the foot of the altar, upon which he laid the  branch of laurel, then putting on a robe as white as snow and passing  the stole around his neck, he began the celebration of the mass before a  congregation composed of all those who had followed him. At the end of  the mass a Te Deum was sung.    He who had just rendered thanks to God for his own victory with all the  solemn ceremonial usually reserved for the triumphs of kings was the  priest Urbain Grandier. Two days before, he had been acquitted, in  virtue of a decision pronounced by M. d'Escoubleau de Sourdis,  Archbishop of Bordeaux, of an accusation brought against him of which he  had been declared guilty by a magistrate, and in punishment of which he  had been condemned to fast on bread and water every Friday for three  months, and forbidden to exercise his priestly functions in the diocese  of Poitiers for five years and in the town of Loudun for ever.    These are the circumstances under which the sentence had been passed and  the judgment reversed.    Urbain Grandier was born at Rovere, a village near Sable, a little town  of Bas-Maine. Having studied the sciences with his father Pierre and his  uncle Claude Grandier, who were learned astrologers and alchemists, he  entered, at the age of twelve, the Jesuit college at Bordeaux, having  already received the ordinary education of a young man. The professors  soon found that besides his considerable attainments he had great  natural gifts for languages and oratory; they therefore made of him a  thorough classical scholar, and in order to develop his oratorical  talent encouraged him to practise preaching. They soon grew very fond of  a pupil who was likely to bring them so much credit, and as soon as he  was old enough to take holy orders they gave him the cure of souls in  the parish of Saint-Pierre in Loudun, which was in the gift of the  college. When he had been some months installed there as a  priest-in-charge, he received a prebendal stall, thanks to the same  patrons, in the collegiate church of Sainte-Croix.    It is easy to understand that the bestowal of these two positions on so  young a man, who did not even belong to the province, made him seem in  some sort a usurper of rights and privileges belonging to the people of  the country, and drew upon him the envy of his brother-ecclesiastics.  There were, in fact, many other reasons why Urbain should be an object  of jealousy to these: first, as we have already said, he was very  handsome, then the instruction which he had received from his father had  opened the world of science to him and given him the key to a thousand  things which were mysteries to the ignorant, but which he fathomed with  the greatest ease. Furthermore, the comprehensive course of study which  he had followed at the Jesuit college had raised him above a crowd of  prejudices, which are sacred to the vulgar, but for which he made no  secret of his contempt; and lastly, the eloquence of his sermons had  drawn to his church the greater part of the regular congregations of the  other religious communities, especially of the mendicant orders, who had  till then, in what concerned preaching, borne away the palm at Loudun.  As we have said, all this was more than enough to excite, first  jealousy, and then hatred. And both were excited in no ordinary degree.    We all know how easily the ill-natured gossip of a small town can rouse  the angry contempt of the masses for everything which is beyond or above  them. In a wider sphere Urbain would have shone by his many gifts, but,  cooped up as he was within the walls of a little town and deprived of  air and space, all that might have conduced to his success in Paris led  to his destruction at Loudun.    It was also unfortunate for Urbain that his character, far from winning  pardon for his genius, augmented the hatred which the latter inspired.  Urbain, who in his intercourse with his friends was cordial and  agreeable, was sarcastic, cold, and haughty to his enemies. When he had  once resolved on a course, he pursued it unflinchingly; he jealously  exacted all the honour due to the rank at which he had arrived,  defending it as though it were a conquest; he also insisted on enforcing  all his legal rights, and he resented the opposition and angry words of  casual opponents with a harshness which made them his lifelong enemies.    The first example which Urbain gave of this inflexibility was in 1620,  when he gained a lawsuit against a priest named Meunier. He caused the  sentence to be carried out with such rigour that he awoke an  inextinguishable hatred in Meunier's mind, which ever after burst forth  on the slightest provocation.    A second lawsuit, which he likewise gained; was one which he undertook  against the chapter of Sainte-Croix with regard to a house, his claim to  which the chapter, disputed. Here again he displayed the same  determination to exact his strict legal rights to the last iota, and  unfortunately Mignon, the attorney of the unsuccessful chapter, was a  revengeful, vindictive, and ambitious man; too commonplace ever to  arrive at a high position, and yet too much above his surroundings to be  content with the secondary position which he occupied. This man, who was  a canon of the collegiate church of Sainte-Croix and director of the  Ursuline convent, will have an important part to play in the following  narrative. Being as hypocritical as Urbain was straightforward, his  ambition was to gain wherever his name was known a reputation for  exalted piety; he therefore affected in his life the asceticism of an  anchorite and the self-denial of a saint. As he had much experience in  ecclesiastical lawsuits, he looked on the chapter's loss of this one, of  which he had in some sort guaranteed the success, as a personal  humiliation, so that when Urbain gave himself airs of triumph and  exacted the last letter of his bond, as in the case of Meunier, he  turned Mignon into an enemy who was not only more relentless but more  dangerous than the former.    In the meantime, and in consequence of this lawsuit, a certain Barot, an  uncle of Mignon and his partner as well, got up a dispute with Urbain,  but as he was a man below mediocrity, Urbain required in order to crush  him only to let fall from the height of his superiority a few of those  disdainful words which brand as deeply as a red-hot iron. This man,  though totally wanting in parts, was very rich, and having no children  was always surrounded by a horde of relatives,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2747"],[0,"Nisida (#1)"],[1,"*NISIDA*                                      _By_                            *Alexandre Dumas, Pere*                _From the Eight Volume set \"Celebrated Crimes\"_                                        1910          CONTENTS          *NISIDA--1825*          *NISIDA--1825*      If our readers, tempted by the Italian proverb about seeing Naples and  then dying, were to ask us what is the most favourable moment for  visiting the enchanted city, we should advise them to land at the mole,  or at Mergellina, on a fine summer day and at the hour when some solemn  procession is moving out of the cathedral. Nothing can give an idea of  the profound and simple-hearted emotion of this populace, which has  enough poetry in its soul to believe in its own happiness. The whole  town adorns herself and attires herself like a bride for her wedding;  the dark facades of marble and granite disappear beneath hangings of  silk and festoons of flowers; the wealthy display their dazzling luxury,  the poor drape themselves proudly in their rags. Everything is light,  harmony, and perfume; the sound is like the hum of an immense hive,  interrupted by a thousandfold outcry of joy impossible to describe. The  bells repeat their sonorous sequences in every key; the arcades echo  afar with the triumphal marches of military bands; the sellers of  sherbet and water-melons sing out their deafening flourish from throats  of copper. People form into groups; they meet, question, gesticulate;  there are gleaming looks, eloquent gestures, picturesque attitudes;  there is a general animation, an unknown charm, an indefinable  intoxication. Earth is very near to heaven, and it is easy to understand  that, if God were to banish death from this delightful spot, the  Neapolitans would desire no other paradise.    The story that we are about to tell opens with one of these magical  pictures. It was the Day of the Assumption in the year 1825; the sun had  been up some four or five hours, and the long Via da Forcella, lighted  from end to end by its slanting rays, cut the town in two, like a ribbon  of watered silk. The lava pavement, carefully cleaned, shone like any  mosaic, and the royal troops, with their proudly waving plumes, made a  double living hedge on each side of the street. The balconies, windows,  and terraces, the stands with their unsubstantial balustrades, and the  wooden galleries set up during the night, were loaded with spectators,  and looked not unlike the boxes of a theatre. An immense crowd, forming  a medley of the brightest colours, invaded the reserved space and broke  through the military barriers, here and there, like an overflowing  torrent. These intrepid sightseers, nailed to their places, would have  waited half their lives without giving the least sign of impatience.    At last, about noon, a cannon-shot was heard, and a cry of general  satisfaction followed it. It was the signal that the procession had  crossed the threshold of the church. In the same moment a charge of  carabineers swept off the people who were obstructing the middle of the  street, the regiments of the line opened floodgates for the overflowing  crowd, and soon nothing remained on the causeway but some scared dog,  shouted at by the people, hunted off by the soldiers, and fleeing at  full speed. The procession came out through the Via di Vescovato. First  came the guilds of merchants and craftsmen, the hatters, weavers,  bakers, butchers, cutlers, and goldsmiths. They wore the prescribed  dress: black coats, knee breeches, low shoes and silver buckles. As the  countenances of these gentlemen offered nothing very interesting to the  multitude, whisperings arose, little by little, among the spectators,  then some bold spirits ventured a jest or two upon the fattest or the  baldest of the townsmen, and at last the boldest of the lazzaroni  slipped between the soldiers' legs to collect the wax that was running  down from the lighted tapers.    After the craftsmen, the religious orders marched past, from the  Dominicans to the Carthusians, from the Carmelites to the Capuchins.  They advanced slowly, their eyes cast down, their step austere, their  hands on their hearts; some faces were rubicund and shining, with large  cheek-hones and rounded chins, herculean heads upon bullnecks; some,  thin and livid, with cheeks hollowed by suffering and penitence, and  with the look of living ghosts; in short, here were the two sides of  monastic life.    At this moment, Nunziata and Gelsomina, two charming damsels, taking  advantage of an old corporal's politeness, pushed forward their pretty  heads into the first rank. The break in the line was conspicuous; but  the sly warrior seemed just a little lax in the matter of discipline.    \"Oh, there is Father Bruno!\" said Gelsomina suddenly. \"Good-day, Father  Bruno.\"    \"Hush, cousin! People do not talk to the procession.\"    \"How absurd! He is my confessor. May I not say good-morning to my  confessor?\"    \"Silence, chatterboxes!\"    \"Who was that spoke?\"    \"Oh, my dear, it was Brother Cucuzza, the begging friar.\"    \"Where is he? Where is he?\"    \"There he is, along there, laughing into his beard. How bold he is!\"    \"Ah, God in heaven! If we were to dream of him---\"    While the two cousins were pouring out endless comments upon the  Capuchins and their beards, the capes of the canons and the surplices of  the seminarists, the 'feroci' came running across from the other side to  re-establish order with the help of their gun-stocks.    \"By the blood of my patron saint,\" cried a stentorian voice, \"if I catch  you between my finger and thumb, I will straighten your back for the  rest of your days.\"    \"Who are you falling out with, Gennaro?\"    \"With this accursed hunchback, who has been worrying my back for the  last hour, as though he could see through it.\"    \"It is a shame,\" returned the hunchback in a tone of lamentation; \"I  have been here since last night, I slept out of doors to keep my place,  and here is this abominable giant comes to stick himself in front of me  like an obelisk.\"    The hunchback was lying like a Jew, but the crowd rose unanimously  against the obelisk. He was, in one way, their superior, and majorities  are always made up of pigmies.    \"Hi! Come down from your stand!\"    \"Hi! get off your pedestal!\"    \"Off with your hat!\"    \"Down with your head!\"    \"Sit down!\"    \"Lie down!\"    This revival of curiosity expressing itself in invectives evidently  betokened the crisis of the show. And indeed the chapters of canons, the  clergy and bishops, the pages and chamberlains, the representatives of  the city, and the gentlemen of the king's chamber now appeared, and  finally the king himself, who, bare-headed and carrying a taper,  followed the magnificent statue of the Virgin. The contrast was  striking: after the grey-headed monks and pale novices came brilliant  young captains, affronting heaven with the points of their moustaches,  riddling the latticed windows with killing glances, following the  procession in an absent-minded way, and interrupting the holy hymns with  scraps of most unorthodox conversation.    \"Did you notice, my dear Doria, how like a monkey the old Marchesa  d'Acquasparta takes her raspberry ice?\"    \"Her nose takes the colour of the ice. What fine bird is showing off to  her?\"    \"It is the Cyrenian.\"    \"I beg your pardon! I have not seen that name in the Golden Book.\"    \"He helps the poor marquis to bear his cross.\"    The officer's profane allusion was lost in the prolonged murmur of  admiration that suddenly rose from the crowd, and every gaze was turned  upon one of the young girls who was strewing flowers before the holy  Madonna. She was an exquisite creature. Her head glowing in the sun  shine, her feet hidden amid roses and broom-blossom, she rose, tall and  fair, from a pale cloud of incense, like some seraphic apparition. Her  hair, of velvet blackness, fell in curls half-way down her shoulders;  her brow, white as alabaster and polished as a mirror, reflected the  rays of the sun; her beautiful and finely arched black eye-brows melted  into the opal of her temples; her eyelids were fast down, and the curled  black fringe of lashes veiled a glowing and liquid glance of divine  emotion; the nose, straight, slender, and cut by two easy nostrils, gave  to her profile that character of antique beauty which is vanishing day  by day from the earth. A calm and serene smile, one of those smiles that  have already left the soul and not yet reached the lips, lifted the  corners of her mouth with a pure expression of infinite beatitude and  gentleness. Nothing could be more perfect than the chin that completed  the faultless oval of this radiant countenance; her neck of a dead  white, joined her bosom in a delicious curve, and supported her head  gracefully like the stalk of a flower moved by a gentle breeze. A bodice  of crimson velvet spotted with gold outlined her delicate and finely  curved figure, and held in by means of a handsome gold lace the  countless folds of a full and flowing skirt, that fell to her feet like  those severe robes in which the Byzantine painters preferred to drape  their angels. She was indeed a marvel, and so rare and modest of beauty  had not been seen within the memory of man.    Among those who had gazed most persistently at her was observed the  young Prince of Brancaleone, one of the foremost nobles of the kingdom.  Handsome, rich, and brave, he had, at five-and-twenty, outdone the lists  of all known Don Juans. Fashionable young women spoke very ill of him  and adored him in secret; the most virtuous made it their rule to fly  from him, so impossible did resistance appear. All the young madcaps had  chosen him for their model; for his triumphs robbed many a Miltiades of  sleep, and with better cause. In short, to get an idea of this lucky  individual, it will be enough to know that as a seducer he was the most  perfect thing that the "]]]
