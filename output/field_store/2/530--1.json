Through the agency of this great endowment, He has in every epoch cast on  the mirror of creation new and wonderful configurations. If we look  objectively upon the world of being, it will become apparent that from age  to age, the temple of existence has continually been embellished with a  fresh grace, and distinguished with an ever-varying splendor, deriving  from wisdom and the power of thought.    This supreme emblem of God stands first in the order of creation and first  in rank, taking precedence over all created things. Witness to it is the  Holy Tradition, \"Before all else, God created the mind.\" From the dawn of  creation, it was made to be revealed in the temple of man.    Sanctified is the Lord, Who with the dazzling rays of this strange,  heavenly power has made our world of darkness the envy of the worlds of  light: \"And the earth shall shine with the light of her Lord.\"(1) Holy and  exalted is He, Who has caused the nature of man to be the dayspring of  this boundless grace: \"The God of mercy hath taught the Qur'an, hath  created man, hath taught him articulate speech.\"(2)    O ye that have minds to know! Raise up your suppliant hands to the heaven  of the one God, and humble yourselves and be lowly before Him, and thank  Him for this supreme endowment, and implore Him to succor us until, in  this present age, godlike impulses may radiate from the conscience of  mankind, and this divinely kindled fire which has been entrusted to the  human heart may never die away.    Consider carefully: all these highly varied phenomena, these concepts,  this knowledge, these technical procedures and philosophical systems,  these sciences, arts, industries and inventions--all are emanations of the  human mind. Whatever people has ventured deeper into this shoreless sea,  has come to excel the rest. The happiness and pride of a nation consist in  this, that it should shine out like the sun in the high heaven of  knowledge. \"Shall they who have knowledge and they who have it not, be  treated alike?\"(3) And the honor and distinction of the individual consist  in this, that he among all the world's multitudes should become a source  of social good. Is any larger bounty conceivable than this, that an  individual, looking within himself, should find that by the confirming  grace of God he has become the cause of peace and well-being, of happiness  and advantage to his fellow men? No, by the one true God, there is no  greater bliss, no more complete delight.    How long shall we drift on the wings of passion and vain desire; how long  shall we spend our days like barbarians in the depths of ignorance and  abomination? God has given us eyes, that we may look about us at the  world, and lay hold of whatsoever will further civilization and the arts  of living. He has given us ears, that we may hear and profit by the wisdom  of scholars and philosophers and arise to promote and practice it. Senses  and faculties have been bestowed upon us, to be devoted to the service of  the general good; so that we, distinguished above all other forms of life  for perceptiveness and reason, should labor at all times and along all  lines, whether the occasion be great or small, ordinary or extraordinary,  until all mankind are safely gathered into the impregnable stronghold of  knowledge. We should continually be establishing new bases for human  happiness and creating and promoting new instrumentalities toward this  end. How excellent, how honorable is man if he arises to fulfil his  responsibilities; how wretched and contemptible, if he shuts his eyes to  the welfare of society and wastes his precious life in pursuing his own  selfish interests and personal advantages. Supreme happiness is man's, and  he beholds the signs of God in the world and in the human soul, if he  urges on the steed of high endeavor in the arena of civilization and  justice. \"We will surely show them Our signs in the world and within  themselves.\"(4)    And this is man's uttermost wretchedness: that he should live inert,  apathetic, dull, involved only with his own base appetites. When he is  thus, he has his being in the deepest ignorance and savagery, sinking  lower than the brute beasts. \"They are like the brutes: Yea, they go more  astray... For the vilest beasts in God's sight, are the deaf, the dumb,  who understand not.\"(5)    We must now highly resolve to arise and lay hold of all those  instrumentalities that promote the peace and well-being and happiness, the  knowledge, culture and industry, the dignity, value and station, of the  entire human race. Thus, through the restoring waters of pure intention  and unselfish effort, the earth of human potentialities will blossom with  its own latent excellence and flower into praiseworthy qualities, and bear  and flourish until it comes to rival that rosegarden of knowledge which  belonged to our forefathers. Then will this holy land of Persia become in  every sense the focal center of human perfections, reflecting as if in a  mirror the full panoply of world civilization.    All praise and honor be to the Dayspring of Divine wisdom, the Dawning  Point of Revelation (Muhammad), and to the holy line of His descendants,  since, by the widespread rays of His consummate wisdom, His universal  knowledge, those savage denizens of Ya_th_rib (Medina) and Batha (Mecca),  miraculously, and in so brief a time, were drawn out of the depths of  their ignorance, rose up to the pinnacles of learning, and became centers  of arts and sciences and human perfections, and stars of felicity and true  civilization, shining across the horizons of the world.    His Majesty the _Sh_ah has, at the present time, [1875] resolved to bring  about the advancement of the Persian people, their welfare and security  and the prosperity of their country. He has spontaneously extended  assistance to his subjects, displaying energy and fair-mindedness, hoping  that by the light of justice he might make Iran the envy of East and West,  and set that fine fervor which characterized the first great epochs of  Persia to flowing again through the veins of her people. As is clear to  the discerning, the writer has for this reason felt it necessary to put  down, for the sake of God alone and as a tribute to this high endeavor, a  brief statement on certain urgent questions. To demonstrate that His one  purpose is to promote the general welfare, He has withheld His name.(6)  Since He believes that guidance toward righteousness is in itself a  righteous act, He offers these few words of counsel to His country's sons,  words spoken for God's sake alone and in the spirit of a faithful friend.  Our Lord, Who knows all things, bears witness that this Servant seeks  nothing but what is right and good; for He, a wanderer in the desert of  God's love, has come into a realm where the hand of denial or assent, of  praise or blame, can touch Him not. \"We nourish your souls for the sake of  God; We seek from you neither recompense nor thanks.\"(7)    \"The hand is veiled, yet the pen writes as bidden;  The horse leaps forward, yet the rider's hidden.\"    O people of Persia! Look into those blossoming pages that tell of another  day, a time long past. Read them and wonder; see the great sight. Iran in  that day was as the heart of the world; she was the bright torch flaming  in the assemblage of mankind. Her power and glory shone out like the  morning above the world's horizons, and the splendor of her learning cast  its rays over East and West. Word of the widespread empire of those who  wore her crown reached even to the dwellers in the arctic circle, and the  fame of the awesome presence of her King of Kings humbled the rulers of  Greece and Rome. The greatest of the world's philosophers marveled at the  wisdom of her government, and her political system became the model for  all the kings of the four continents then known. She was distinguished  among all peoples for the scope of her dominion, she was honored by all  for her praiseworthy culture and civilization. She was as the pivot of the  world, she was the source and center of sciences and arts, the wellspring  of great inventions and discoveries, the rich mine of human virtues and  perfections. The intellect, the wisdom of the individual members of this  excellent nation dazzled the minds of other peoples, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#1)"],[1,"of World Unity      by 'Abdu'l-Baha          Edition 1, (September 2006)                                       BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.

The period of  maturity in the life of a tree is the time of its fruit-bearing. The  maturity of a plant is the time of its blossoming and flower. The animal  attains a stage of full growth and completeness, and in the human kingdom  man reaches his maturity when the lights of intelligence have their  greatest power and development.    From the beginning to the end of his life man passes through certain  periods or stages each of which is marked by certain conditions peculiar  to itself. For instance during the period of childhood his conditions and  requirements are characteristic of that degree of intelligence and  capacity. After a time he enters the period of youth in which his former  conditions and needs are superseded by new requirements applicable to the  advance in his degree. His faculties of observation are broadened and  deepened, his intelligent capacities are trained and awakened, the  limitations and environment of childhood no longer restrict his energies  and accomplishments. At last he passes out of the period of youth and  enters the stage or station of maturity which necessitates another  transformation and corresponding advance in his sphere of life-activity.  New powers and perceptions clothe him, teaching and training commensurate  with his progression occupy his mind, special bounties and bestowals  descend in proportion to his increased capacities and his former period of  youth and its conditions will no longer satisfy his matured view and  vision.    Similarly there are periods and stages in the life of the aggregate world  of humanity which at one time was passing through its degree of childhood,  at another its time of youth but now has entered its long presaged period  of maturity, the evidences of which are everywhere visible and apparent.  Therefore the requirements and conditions of former periods have changed  and merged into exigencies which distinctly characterize the present age  of the world of mankind. That which was applicable to human needs during  the early history of the race could neither meet nor satisfy the demands  of this day and period of newness and consummation. Humanity has emerged  from its former degrees of limitation and preliminary training. Man must  now become imbued with new virtues and powers, new moralities, new  capacities. New bounties, bestowals and perfections are awaiting and  already descending upon him. The gifts and graces of the period of youth  although timely and sufficient during the adolescence of the world of  mankind, are now incapable of meeting the requirements of its maturity.  The playthings of childhood and infancy no longer satisfy or interest the  adult mind.    From every standpoint the world of humanity is undergoing a re-formation.  The laws of former governments and civilizations are in process of  revision, scientific ideas and theories are developing and advancing to  meet a new range of phenomena, invention and discovery are penetrating  hitherto unknown fields revealing new wonders and hidden secrets of the  material universe; industries have vastly wider scope and production;  everywhere the world of mankind is in the throes of evolutionary activity  indicating the passing of the old conditions and advent of the new age of  re-formation. Old trees yield no fruitage; old ideas and methods are  obsolete and worthless now. Old standards of ethics, moral codes and  methods of living in the past will not suffice for the present age of  advancement and progress.    This is the cycle of maturity and re-formation in religion as well.  Dogmatic imitations of ancestral beliefs are passing. They have been the  axis around which religion revolved but now are no longer fruitful; on the  contrary, in this day they have become the cause of human degradation and  hindrance. Bigotry and dogmatic adherence to ancient beliefs have become  the central and fundamental source of animosity among men, the obstacle to  human progress, the cause of warfare and strife, the destroyer of peace,  composure and welfare in the world. Consider conditions in the Balkans  today(1); fathers, mothers, children in grief and lamentation, the  foundations of life overturned, cities laid waste and fertile lands made  desolate by the ravages of war. These conditions are the outcome of  hostility and hatred between nations and peoples of religion who imitate  and adhere to the forms and violate the spirit and reality of the divine  teachings.    While this is true and apparent, it is likewise evident that the Lord of  mankind has bestowed infinite bounties upon the world in this century of  maturity and consummation. The ocean of divine mercy is surging, the  vernal showers are descending, the Sun of Reality is shining gloriously.  Heavenly teachings applicable to the advancement in human conditions have  been revealed in this merciful age. This re-formation and renewal of the  fundamental reality of religion constitute the true and outworking spirit  of modernism, the unmistakable light of the world, the manifest effulgence  of the Word of God, the divine remedy for all human ailment and the bounty  of eternal life to all mankind.            THE SOURCE OF REALITY      In our solar system, the center of illumination is the sun itself. Through  the will of God this central luminary is the one source of the existence  and development of all phenomenal things. When we observe the organisms of  the material kingdoms we find that their growth and training are dependent  upon the heat and light of the sun. Without this quickening impulse there  would be no growth of tree or vegetation, neither would the existence of  animal or human being be possible; in fact no forms of created life would  be manifest upon the earth. But if we reflect deeply we will perceive that  the great bestower and giver of life is God; the sun is the intermediary  of His will and plan. Without the bounty of the sun therefore the world  would be in darkness. All illumination of our planetary system proceeds or  emanates from the solar center.    Likewise in the spiritual realm of intelligence and idealism there must be  a center of illumination, and that center is the everlasting, ever-shining  Sun, the Word of God. Its lights are the lights of reality which have  shone upon humanity, illumining the realm of thought and morals,  conferring the bounties of the divine world upon man. These lights are the  cause of the education of souls and the source of the enlightenment of  hearts, sending forth in effulgent radiance the message of the  glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God. In brief, the moral and ethical world  and the world of spiritual regeneration are dependent for their  progressive being upon that heavenly center of illumination. It gives  forth the light of religion and bestows the life of the spirit, imbues  humanity with archetypal virtues and confers eternal splendors. This Sun  of Reality, this center of effulgences is the prophet or Manifestation of  God. Just as the phenomenal sun shines upon the material world producing  life and growth, likewise the spiritual or prophetic Sun confers  illumination upon the human world of thought and intelligence, and unless  it rose upon the horizon of human existence the kingdom of man would  become dark and extinguished.    The Sun of Reality is one Sun but it has different dawning-places, just as  the phenomenal sun is one although it appears at various points of the  horizon. During the time of spring the luminary of the physical world  rises far to the north of the equinoctial; in summer it dawns midway and  in winter it appears in the most southerly point of its zodiacal journey.  These day-springs or dawning-points differ widely but the sun is ever the  same sun whether it be the phenomenal or spiritual luminary. Souls who  focus their vision upon the Sun of Reality will be the recipients of light  no matter from what point it rises, but those who are fettered by  adoration of the dawning-poin"]]]
