[Illustration: 1-597-charles1a.jpg  CHARLES I.]          CHARLES I.    {1625.} No sooner had Charles taken into his hands the reins of  government, than he showed an impatience to assemble the great council  of the nation; and he would gladly, for the sake of despatch, have  called together the same parliament which had sitten under his father,  and which lay at that time under prorogation. But being told that  this measure would appear unusual, he issued writs for summoning a new  parliament on the seventh of May; and it was not without regret that  the arrival of the princess Henrietta, whom he had espoused by proxy,  obliged him to delay, by repeated prorogations, their meeting till the  eighteenth of June, when they assembled at Westminster for the despatch  of business. The young prince, unexperienced and impolitic, regarded as  sincere all the praises and caresses with which he had been loaded while  active in procuring the rupture with the house of Austria. And besides  that he labored under great necessities, he hastened with alacrity to a  period when he might receive the most undoubted testimony of the dutiful  attachment of his subjects. His discourse to the parliament was full of  simplicity and cordiality. He lightly mentioned the occasion which he  had for supply.[*] He employed no intrigue to influence the suffrages of  the members. He would not even allow the officers of the crown, who  had seats in the house, to mention any particular sum which might be  expected by him Secure of the affections of the commons, he was  resolved that their bounty should be entirely their own deed; unasked,  unsolicited; the genuine fruit of sincere confidence and regard.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 171. Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 346.       Franklyn, p. 108.    The house of commons accordingly took into consideration the business of  supply. They knew that all the money granted by the last parliament  had been expended on naval and military armaments; and that great  anticipations were likewise made on the revenues of the crown. They were  not ignorant that Charles was loaded with a large debt, contracted by  his father, who had borrowed money both from his own subjects and from  foreign princes. They had learned by experience, that the public revenue  could with difficulty maintain the dignity of the crown, even under the  ordinary charges of government. They were sensible, that the present  war was very lately the result of their own importunate applications  and entreaties, and that they had solemnly engaged to support their  sovereign in the management of it. They were acquainted with the  difficulty of military enterprises directed against the whole house of  Austria; against the king of Spain, possessed of the greatest riches and  most extensive dominions of any prince in Europe; against the emperor  Ferdinand, hitherto the most fortunate monarch of his age, who had  subdued and astonished Germany by the rapidity of his victories. Deep  impressions they saw must be made by the English sword, and a vigorous  offensive war be waged against these mighty potentates, ere they would  resign a principality which they had now fully subdued, and which they  held in secure possession, by its being surrounded with all their other  territories.    To answer, therefore, all these great and important ends; to satisfy  their young king in the first request which he made them; to prove  their sense of the many royal virtues, particularly economy, with which  Charles was endued; the house of Commons, conducted by the wisest and  ablest senators that had ever flourished in England, thought proper to  confer on the king a supply of two subsidies, amounting to one hundred  and twelve thousand pounds.[*]         * A subsidy was now fallen to about fifty-six thousand       pounds Cabala, p. 224, 1st edit.    This measure, which discovers rather a cruel mockery of Charles, than  any serious design of supporting him, appears so extraordinary, when  considered in all its circumstances, that it naturally summons up our  attention, and raises an inquiry concerning the causes of a conduct  unprecedented in an English parliament. So numerous an assembly,  composed of persons of various dispositions, was not, it is probable,  wholly influenced by the same motives; and few declared openly their  true reason. We shall, therefore, approach nearer to the truth, if we  mention all the views which the present conjuncture could suggest to  them.    It is not to be doubted, but spleen and ill will against the duke of  Buckingham had an influence with many. So vast and rapid a fortune, so  little merited, could not fail to excite public envy; and however men's  hatred might have been suspended for a moment, while the duke's conduct  seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices, it was impossible  for him long to preserve the affections of the people. His influence  over the modesty of Charles exceeded even that which he had acquired  over the weakness of James; nor was any public measure conducted but  by his counsel and direction. His vehement temper prompted him to raise  suddenly, to the highest elevation, his flatterers and dependants; and  upon the least occasion of displeasure, he threw them down with equal  impetuosity and violence. Implacable in his hatred, fickle in his  friendships, all men were either regarded as his enemies, or dreaded  soon to become such. The whole power of the kingdom was grasped by his  insatiable hand; while he both engrossed the entire confidence of his  master, and held invested in his single person the most considerable  offices of the crown.    However the ill humor of the commons might have been increased by these  considerations, we are not to suppose them the sole motives. The last  parliament of James, amidst all their joy and festivity, had given him  a supply very disproportioned to his demand, and to the occasion. And as  every house of commons which was elected during forty years, succeeded  to all the passions and principles of their predecessors, we ought  rather to account for this obstinacy from the general situation of the  kingdom during that whole period, than from any circumstances which  attended this particular conjuncture.    The nation was very little accustomed at that time to the burden of  taxes, and had never opened their purses in any degree for supporting  their sovereign. Even Elizabeth, notwithstanding her vigor and  frugality, and the necessary wars in which she was engaged, had reason  to complain of the commons in this particular; nor could the authority  of that princess, which was otherwise almost absolute, ever extort from  them the requisite supplies. Habits, more than reason, we find in every  thing to be the governing principle of mankind. In this view, likewise,  the sinking of the value of subsidies must be considered as a loss to  the king. The parliament, swayed by custom, would not augment their  number in the same proportion.    The Puritanical party, though disguised, had a great authority over the  kingdom; and many of the leaders among the commons had secretly embraced  the rigid tenets of that sect. All these were disgusted with the court,  both by the prevalence of the principles of civil liberty essential to  their party, and on account of the restraint under which they were held  by the established hierarchy. In order to fortify himself against the  resentment of James, Buckingham had affected popularity, and entered  into the cabals of the Puritans: but, being secure of the confidence of  Charles, he had since abandoned this party; and on that account was  the more exposed to their hatred and resentment. Though the religious  schemes of many of the Puritans, when explained, appear pretty  frivolous, we are not thence to imagine that they were pursued by none  but persons of weak understandings. Some men of the greatest parts and  most extensive knowledge that the nation at this time produced, could  not enjoy any peace of mind, because obliged to hear prayers offered up  to the Divinity by a priest covered with a white linen vestment.    The match with France, and the articles in favor of Catholics which were  suspected to be in the treaty, were likewise causes of disgust to this  whole party: though it must be remarked, that the connections with that  crown were much less obnoxious to the Protestants, and less agreeable to  the Catholics, than the alliance formerly projected with Spain, and were  therefore received rather with pleasure than dissatisfaction.    To all these causes we must yet add another, of considerable moment. The  house of commons, we may observe, was almost entirely governed by a set  of men of the most uncommon capacity and the largest views; men who were  now formed into a regular party, and united, as well by fixed aims  and projects, as by the hardships which some of them had undergone in  prosecution of them.

From Charles II. to James II.          CHAPTER LXIII.    [Illustration: 1-756-charles2.jpg  CHARLES II.]          CHARLES II.      {1660.} CHARLES II., when he ascended the throne of his ancestors, was  thirty years of age. He possessed a vigorous constitution, a fine shape,  a manly figure, a graceful air; and though his features were harsh,  yet was his countenance in the main lively and engaging. He was in that  period of life when there remains enough of youth to render the person  amiable, without preventing that authority and regard which attend the  years of experience and maturity. Tenderness was excited by the memory  of his recent adversities. His present prosperity was the object rather  of admiration than of envy. And as the sudden and surprising revolution  which restored him to his regal rights, had also restored the nation to  peace, law, order, and liberty, no prince ever obtained a crown in more  favorable circumstances, or was more blessed with the cordial affection  and attachment of his subjects.    This popularity the king, by his whole demeanor and behavior, was  well qualified to support and to increase. To a lively wit and quick  comprehension, he united a just understanding and a general observation  both of men and things. The easiest manners, the most unaffected  politeness, the most engaging gayety, accompanied his conversation and  address. Accustomed during his exile, to live among his courtiers rather  like a companion than a monarch, he retained, even while on the  throne, that open affability which was capable of reconciling the  most determined republicans to his royal dignity. Totally devoid of  resentment, as well from the natural lenity as carelessness of his  temper, he insured pardon to the most guilty of his enemies, and left  hopes of favor to his most violent opponents. From the whole tenor of  his actions and discourse, he seemed desirous of losing the memory of  past animosities, and of uniting every party in an affection for their  prince and their native country.    Into his council were admitted the most eminent men of the nation,  without regard to former distinctions: the Presbyterians, equally with  the royalists, shared this honor. Annesley was also created earl of  Anglesey; Ashley Cooper, Lord Ashley; Denzil Hollis, Lord Hollis. The  earl of Manchester was appointed lord chamberlain, and Lord Say,  privy seal. Calamy and Baxter, Presbyterian clergymen, were even made  chaplains to the king.    Admiral Montague, created earl of Sandwich, was entitled from his recent  services to great favor; and he obtained it. Monk, created duke of  Albemarle, had performed such signal services, that, according to a  vulgar and malignant observation, he ought rather to have expected  hatred and ingratitude; yet was he ever treated by the king with great  marks of distinction. Charles's disposition, free from jealousy, and  the prudent behavior of the general, who never overrated his merits,  prevented all those disgusts which naturally arise in so delicate a  situation. The capacity, too, of Albemarle was not extensive, and his  parts were more solid than shining. Though he had distinguished himself  in inferior stations, he was imagined, upon familiar acquaintance, not  to be wholly equal to those great achievements which fortune, united  to prudence, had enabled him to perform; and he appeared unfit for the  court, a scene of life to which he had never been accustomed. Morrice,  his friend, was created secretary of state, and was supported more by  his patron's credit than by his own abilities or experience.    But the choice which the king at first made of his principal ministers  and favorites, was the circumstance which chiefly gave contentment to  the nation, and prognosticated future happiness and tranquillity.  Sir Edward Hyde, created earl of Clarendon, was chancellor and prime  minister; the marquis, created duke of Ormond, was steward of the  household, the earl of Southampton, high treasurer; Sir Edward Nicholas,  secretary of state. These men, united together in friendship, and  combining in the same laudable inclinations, supported each other's  credit, and pursued the interests of the public.    Agreeable to the present prosperity of public affairs was the universal  joy and festivity diffused throughout the nation. The melancholy  austerity of the fanatics fell into discredit together with their  principles. The royalists, who had ever affected a contrary disposition,  found in their recent success new motives for mirth and gayety; and it  now belonged to them to give repute and fashion to their manners. From  past experience it had sufficiently appeared, that gravity was very  distinct from wisdom, formality from virtue, and hypocrisy from  religion. The king himself, who bore a strong propensity to pleasure,  served, by his powerful and engaging example, to banish those sour  and malignant humors which had hitherto engendered such confusion. And  though the just bounds were undoubtedly passed, when men returned from  their former extreme, yet was the public happy in exchanging vices  pernicious to society, for disorders hurtful chiefly to the individuals  themselves who were guilty of them.    It required some time before the several parts of the state, disfigured  by war and faction, could recover their former arrangement; but the  parliament immediately fell into good correspondence with the king; and  they treated him with the same dutiful regard which had usually been  paid to his predecessors. Being summoned without the king's consent,  they received, at first, only the title of a convention; and it was not  till he passed an act for that purpose, that they were called by the  appellation of parliament. All judicial proceedings, transacted in the  name of the commonwealth or protector, were ratified by a new law. And  both houses, acknowledging the guilt of the former rebellion, gratefully  received, in their own name, and in that of all the subjects, his  majesty's gracious pardon and indemnity.    The king, before his restoration, being afraid of reducing any of his  enemies to despair, and at the same time unwilling that such enormous  crimes as had been committed should receive a total impunity, had  expressed himself very cautiously in his declaration of Breda, and had  promised an indemnity to all criminals, but such as should be excepted  by parliament. He now issued a proclamation declaring that such of the  late king's judges as did not yield themselves pris-* *-oners within  fourteen days, should receive no pardon. Nine teen surrendered  themselves; some were taken in their flight; others escaped beyond sea.    The commons seem to have been more inclined to lenity than the lords.  The upper house, inflamed by the ill usage which they had received, were  resolved, besides the late king's judges, to except every one who had  sitten in any high court of justice. Nay, the earl of Bristol moved,  that no pardon might be granted to those who had anywise contributed  to the king's death. So wide an exception, in which every one who had  served the parliament might be comprehended, gave a general alarm; and  men began to apprehend, that this motion was the effect of some court  artifice or intrigue. But the king soon dissipated these fears. He came  to the house of peers, and in the most earnest terms passed the act of  general indemnity. He urged both the necessity of the thing, and the  obligation of his former promise; a promise, he said which he would ever  regard as sacred; since to it he probably owed the satisfaction which at  present he enjoyed of meeting his people in parliament. This measure of  the king's was received with great applause and satisfaction.    After repeated solicitations, the act of indemnity passed both houses,  and soon received the royal assent. Those who had an immediate hand  in the late king's death, were there excepted: even Cromwell, Ireton,  Bradshaw, and others now dead, were attainted, and their estates  forfeited. Vane and Lambert, though none of the regicides, were also  excepted. St. John and seventeen persons more were deprived of all  benefit from this act, if they ever accepted any public employment. All  who had sitten in any illegal high court of justice were disabled from  bearing offices. These were all the severities which followed such  furious civil wars and convulsions.    The next business was the settlement of the king's revenue. In this  work, the parliament had regard to public freedom, as well as to the  support of the crown. The tenures of wards and liveries had long been  regarded as a grievous burden by the nobility and gentry: several  attempts had been made during the reign of James to purchase this  prerogative, together with that of purveyance: and two hundred thousand  pounds a year had been offered that prince in lieu of them; wardships  and purveyance had been utterly abolished by the republican parliament;  and even in the present parliament before the king arrived in England,  a bill had been introduced offering him a compensation for the"]]]
