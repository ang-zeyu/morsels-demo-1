I DEDICATE AFFECTIONATELY    A WORK    WHICH OWES MUCH TO HIS ENCOURAGEMENT          PREFACE      The following lectures were delivered on Lord Gifford's Foundation  before the University of St. Andrews in the early winters of 1911 and  1912. They are printed nearly as they were spoken, except that a few  passages, omitted for the sake of brevity in the oral delivery, have  been here restored and a few more added. Further, I have compressed the  two introductory lectures into one, striking out some passages which on  reflection I judged to be irrelevant or superfluous. The volume  incorporates twelve lectures on \"The Fear and Worship of the Dead\" which  I delivered in the Lent and Easter terms of 1911 at Trinity College,  Cambridge, and repeated, with large additions, in my course at St.  Andrews.    The theme here broached is a vast one, and I hope to pursue it hereafter  by describing the belief in immortality and the worship of the dead, as  these have been found among the other principal races of the world both  in ancient and modern times. Of all the many forms which natural  religion has assumed none probably has exerted so deep and far-reaching  an influence on human life as the belief in immortality and the worship  of the dead; hence an historical survey of this most momentous creed and  of the practical consequences which have been deduced from it can hardly  fail to be at once instructive and impressive, whether we regard the  record with complacency as a noble testimony to the aspiring genius of  man, who claims to outlive the sun and the stars, or whether we view it  with pity as a melancholy monument of fruitless labour and barren  ingenuity expended in prying into that great mystery of which fools  profess their knowledge and wise men confess their ignorance.

Reprinted by permission from \"The Religious Magazine and Monthly  Review.\"  Boston: Crosby & Damrell, 100 Washington St. 1870.          A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF RELIGIONS.          INTRODUCTION.[1]      The conception of religion presupposes, _a_, God as object; _b_, man as  subject; _c_, the mutual relation existing between them. According to  the various stages of development which men have reached, religious  belief manifests itself either in the form of a passive feeling of  dependence, where the subject, not yet conscious of his independence,  feels himself wholly overmastered by the deity, or the object of  worship, as by a power outside of and opposed to himself; or, when the  feeling of independence has awakened, in a one-sided elevation of the  human, whereby man in worshiping a deity deifies himself. In the highest  stage of religious development, the most entire feeling of dependence is  united in religion with the strongest consciousness of personal  independence. The first of these forms is exhibited in the fetich and  nature-worship of the ancient nations; the second in Buddhism, and in  the deification of the human, which reaches its full height among the  Greeks. The true religion, prepared in Israel, is the Christian, in  which man, grown conscious of his oneness with God, is ruled by the  divine as an inner power of life, and acts spontaneously and freely  while in the fullest dependence upon God. Since Christ, no more perfect  religion has appeared. What is true and good in Islamism was borrowed  from Israel and Christianity.    Although it is probable that every nation passed through different forms  of religious belief before its religion reached its highest development,  yet the earlier periods lie in great part beyond the reach of historical  investigation. The history of religion, therefore, has for its task the  review of the various forms of religion with which we are historically  acquainted, in the order of psychological development.          CHAPTER I.    FETICHISM. THE CHINESE. THE EGYPTIANS.      1. FETICHISM.    The lowest stage of religious development is fetichism, as it is found  among the savage tribes of the polar regions, and in Africa, America,  and Australia. In this stage, man's needs are as yet very limited and  exclusively confined to the material world. Still too little developed  intellectually to worship the divine in nature and her powers, he thinks  he sees the divinity which he seeks in every unknown object which  strikes his senses, or which his imagination calls up. In this stage,  religion has no higher character than that of caprice and of love of  the mysterious and marvelous, mixed with fear and a slavish adoration of  the divine. The worship and the priest's office (Shaman, Shamanism)  consist here chiefly in the use of charms, to exorcise a dreaded power.  From this savage fetichism the nature-worship found among the Aztecs in  Mexico, and the worship of the sun in Peru, are distinguished by the  greater definiteness and order of their religious conceptions and  usages. In them the gods have names, and an ordained priesthood cares  for the religious interests of the people. The highest form to which  fetichism has attained is the worship of Manitou, the great spirit,  which is found among the ancient tribes of North America.      2. THE CHINESE.    When man reaches a higher development, caprice and chance disappear from  religion. Having outgrown fetichism, man begins, as is the case among  the Chinese, to distinguish in the world around him an active and a  passive principle, force and matter (Yang and Yn), heaven and earth  (Kien and Kouen). We have here nature-worship in its beginnings. In this  stage, even less than in fetichism, is there a definite idea of God,  much less a conception of him as personal and spiritual lord. The  Chinese, from the practical, empirical point of view peculiar to him,  recognizes the spiritual only in man and chiefly in the state. His  religion, therefore, is confined exclusively to the faithful keeping of  the laws of the state (the Celestial Kingdom), in which he sees the  reflection of heaven, to the recognition of the Emperor as the son and  representative of heaven, and to the worship of the forefathers,  especially of the great men and departed emperors, to whose memory the  Chinese temples, or pagodas, are dedicated. The origin of this religion  dates, according to the tradition, from Fo-hi (2950 B.C.), the founder  of the Chinese state. In the fifth century before Christ, Kong-tse, or  Kong-fu-tse (Confucius), appeared as a reformer of the religion of his  countrymen, and gathered the ancient records and traditions of his  people into a sacred literature, which is known by the name of the  \"King\" (the books), \"Yo-King\" (the book of nature), \"Chu-King\" (the book  of history), \"Chi-King\" (the book of songs). The contents of the \"King\"  became later with the Chinese sages Meng-tse (360 B.C.) and Tschu-tsche  (1200 A.D.) an object of philosophical speculation. The doctrine of  Lao-tse, the younger contemporary of Kong-tse, which lays down as the  basis of the world, that is of the unreal or non-existent, a supreme  principle, _Tao_, or _Being_, corresponds with the Brahma doctrine of  the Indians, among whom he lived for a long time; but this doctrine  never became popular in China.      3. THE EGYPTIANS.    The worship of nature, which is seen in its beginnings among the  Chinese, exhibits itself among the Egyptians in a more developed form as  theogony. Here also the reflecting mind rose to the recognition of two  fundamental principles, the producing and the passive power of nature,  Kneph and Neith, from which sprang successively the remaining powers of  nature, time, air, earth, light and darkness, personified by the fantasy  of the people into as many divinities. The Egyptian mythology also (none  has as yet been discovered among the Chinese) exhibits a like character.  Fruitfulness and drought, the results of the Nile's overflowing and  receding, are imaged in the myth of _Osiris_, _Isis_, and _Typhon_. The  visible form under which the divine was worshiped in Egypt was the  sacred animal, the bull _Apis_, dedicated to _Osiris_, the cow,  dedicated to _Isis_, as symbols of agriculture; the bird _Ibis_, the  crocodile, the dog _Anubis_, and other animals, whose physical  characteristics impressed the as yet childish man, who saw in them the  symbol, either of the beneficent power of nature which moved him to  thankfulness, or of a destructive power which he dreaded and whose anger  he sought to avert. The religion of Egypt was not of a purely spiritual  character. To the man whose eye is not yet open to the manifestation of  the spiritual around him and in him, the divine is not spirit, but as  yet only nature. The animal, although in the form of the sphinx  approaching the human, holds in Egyptian art a place above the human as  symbol of the divine.          CHAPTER II.    THE ARIAN NATIONS.      1. THE EAST ARIANS. THE INDIANS.    In the development of religion among the Indians, the following periods  may be distinguished:--       _a._ The original Veda-religion.       _b._ The priestly religion of the Brahmins.       _c._ The philosophical speculation.       _d._ Buddhism.       _e._ The modified Brahminism after Buddha, in connection with the     worship of Vishnu and Siva.      _a. The original Veda-religion._    The original religion of Arya originated in Bactria. From thence, before  the time of Zoroaster, it was brought over, with the great migration of  the people, to the land of the seven rivers, which they conquered, and  which stretched from the Indus to the Hesidrus. It consisted, according  to the oldest literature of the Veda, in a polytheistical worship of the  divine, either as the beneficent or the baneful power of nature. The  clear, blue sky, the light of the sun, the rosy dawn, the storm that  spends itself in fruitful rain, the winds and gales which drive away the  clouds, the rivers whose fruitful slime overspreads the fields,--these  moved the inhabitants of India to the worship of the divine as the  beneficent power of nature which blesses man. On the other hand, he  changed under the impression of the harmful phenomena of nature, the  dark and close-packed clouds which hold back the rain and intercept the  sunshine, the parching heat of summer, which dries up the rivers and  hinders growth and fruitfulness, and these also he erected into objects  of awe and religious adoration. From this view of nature sprang the  Indian mythology. The oldest divinity (Deva) of the Indians is Varuna,  the all-embracing heaven, who marks out their courses for the heavenly  luminaries, who rules the day and the night, who is lord of life and  death, whose protection is invoked, whose anger deprecated. After him,  the great ruler of nature, there appear, in the Veda hymns, Indra, the  blue sky, god of light and thunder, the warrior who in battle stands  beside the combatants; Vayu, the god of the wind, the chief of the  Maruts, or the winds; Rudra, the god of the hurricane; Vritra, the  hostile god of the clouds; Ahi, the parching heat of summer. In the  mythology of the people, Indra, god of light, aided by Vayu and Rudra,  wages war with Vritra,--who, as god of the clouds, holds back the rain  and the light,--and appears as opponent of the"]]]
