PREFACE.      In whatever light this work may be regarded by archaeologists and  general readers, the writer submits it to the public, chiefly as the  result of antiquarian research, and actual observation during a period  of nearly forty years. The writer does not attempt to define what  superstition is, either in its broadest or most literal sense; but, as  he desires the expression to be understood, it may be considered to  imply a fear of the Evil One and his emissaries, a trust in benign  spirits and saints, a faith in occult science, and a belief that a  conjunction of certain planets or other inanimate bodies is capable of  producing supernatural effects, either beneficial or prejudicial to  man. Superstition, generally so called, has run through a course of  ages from sire to son, leaving it still deeply rooted in the minds of  many of the present generation.    Not a few seeming repetitions in this work are not such in reality,  but are instances brought forward to mark the resemblance between the  opinions prevalent in past and present times, and to illustrate the  similarity of perverted views in various parts of the world.    The examples of superstition herein given are taken from an almost  unlimited number, yet the writer confesses to have omitted many  interesting particulars. In proof of this it may be stated, that while  the last sheet of these pages was being revised, an esteemed friend  wrote, saying: \"I can quite corroborate what you say of Ireland; for  lately, on my way from Macroom to Glengariff, at a weird mountain  pass, the coach stopped to enable us to visit the hermitage of St.  Finbar. There, beside a lonely lake, I saw a number of devotees,  afflicted with various ailments, expecting to be healed through the  good offices of the departed saint.\"    In spite of a determination to omit unimportant matter and to be  concise, this volume has swelled out far beyond what was originally  intended. The more the subject of superstition is studied, the more  interesting it becomes. One judges of a nation's strength by its  victories, of its industry by its products, of its wealth by its mines  and cultivated fields, of its domestic condition by its diet and  dress, of its moral condition by its laws, of its religion and  intelligence by its literature; but before obtaining full knowledge of  a people's convictions, it is necessary to search into their  superstitions. In these are discovered the secrets of man's inner  life, and by these also have been forged strong fetters, which have  kept his soul in thraldom for ages.    If the author has succeeded in pointing out, that, notwithstanding the  progress of science and the advancement of civilisation and  Christianity, some of the darker shadows that have disfigured past  ages are still floating over a portion of our social horizon, he feels  his labour will not have been altogether in vain. Like many of the  ghosts alluded to in the following pages, that of superstition needs  only the continued light of day to shine upon it, in order to make it  vanish for ever.    _January 1880._          CONTENTS.           *       *       *       *       *    THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF SUPERSTITION.

The accompanying paper is one of the results of personal investigations  among the Omaha of Nebraska and cognate tribes of Indians, beginning in  1878 and continued from time to time during late years.    While the paper treats of the Omaha tribe, much that is said is  applicable to the Ponka, as the two tribes have long had similar  environments and a common dialect, for, until 1877, their habitats were  almost contiguous, and since 1880 about one-third of the Ponka tribe has  been dwelling on its former reservation near the town of Niobrara,  Nebraska.    Acknowledgments are due Dr. O. T. Mason for many valuable suggestions  early in the progress of the work.          DWELLINGS.      The primitive domiciles of the Omaha were chiefly (1) lodges of earth  or, more rarely, of bark or mats, and (2) skin lodges or tents. It may  be observed that there were no sacred rites connected with the earth  lodge-building or tent-making among the Omaha and Ponka.      Earth Lodges.    When earth lodges were built, the people did not make them in a tribal  circle, each man erecting his lodge where he wished; yet kindred  commonly built near one another.    The earth lodges were made by the women, and were intended principally  for summer use, when the people were not migrating or going on the hunt.  Those built by the Omaha and Ponka were constructed in the following  manner: The roof was supported by two series of vertical posts, forked  at the top for the reception of the transverse connecting pieces of each  series. The number in each series varied according to the size of the  lodge; for a small lodge only four posts were erected in the inner  series, for an ordinary lodge eight were required, and ten generally  constituted the maximum. When Mr. Say[1] visited the Kansa Indians, he  occupied a lodge in which twelve of these posts placed in a circle  formed the outer series, and eight longer ones constituted the inner  series, also describing a circle. The wall was formed by setting upright  slabs of wood back of the outer posts all around the circumference of  the lodge. These slabs were not over 6 feet in height, and their tops  met the cross timbers on which the willow posts rested. Stocks of hard  willow about 2 inches in diameter rested with their butts on the tops of  the upright slabs and extended on the cross timbers nearly to the  summit. These poles were very numerous, touching one another and  extending all around in a radiating manner, supporting the roof like  rafters. The rafters were covered with grass about a foot thick; and  over the whole lodge, including the sides or slabs, earth was piled from  a foot to 2 feet in depth. Such a covering lasted generally about twenty  years. A hole in the middle served as an exit for the smoke.    [Footnote 1: James' account of Long's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains  in 1819-'20.]    [Illustration: Fig. 306.--Yellow Smoke's earth lodge.]    In addition to the lodge proper there was a covered way about 10 feet  long and 5 feet wide, the entrance to which had a covering of tanned or  dried buffalo hides. This covering consisted of two hides hanging side  by side, with the inner borders slightly overlapping. They were fastened  to the passageway at the top and at the outer sides, but were loose at  the bottom where they overlapped. This part was raised by a person  entering the lodge. A similar covering was placed at the interior end of  the passageway.    Subsequently to 1855, the Omaha dwelt in three villages composed of  earth lodges, as follows: (1) Biku[']de, a village near the agency; (2)  Windja[']ge, Standing Hawk's village, near the Presbyterian mission  house; and (3) Ja^{n}[|c]a[']te (\"Wood Eaters,\") named after an insect  found under the bark of trees Sanssouci's village, near the town of  Decatur, Nebraska.    Earth lodges were generally used for large gatherings, such as feasts,  councils, or dances. Occasionally there was a depression in the center  of the lodge which was used as a fireplace; but it was not over 6 inches  deep. Each earth lodge had a ladder, made by cutting a series of deep  notches along one side of a log. On a bluff near the Omaha agency I  found the remains of several ancient earth lodges, with entrances on the  southern sides. Two of these were 75 feet and one was 100 feet in  diameter. In the center of the largest there was a hollow about 3 feet  deep and nearly 4 feet below the surface outside the lodge.      Lodges of Bark or Mats.    The Omaha sometimes make bark lodges for summer occupancy, as did the  Iowa and Sak. [T]iu['][|c]ipu jin[']ga, or low lodges covered with  mats, were used by the Omaha in former days. Such lodges are still  common among the Winnebago, the Osage, and other tribes. The ground plan  of such a lodge forms an ellipse. The height is hardly over 7 feet from  the ground. The tent poles are arranged thus: Each pole has one end  planted in the ground, the other end being bent down and fastened to the  pole immediately opposite; a number of poles thus arranged in pairs  formed both wall posts and rafters.    [Illustration: Fig. 307.--Ground plan of Osage lodge.]    Generally there was one fireplace and one smokehole in such a lodge; but  when I visited the Osage in 1883, I entered a low lodge with two  fireplaces, each equidistant from its end of the lodge and the entrance,  each fireplace having its smokehole.      Skin Lodges or Tents.    The tent was used when the people were migrating, and also when they  were traveling in search of the buffalo. It was also the favorite abode  of a household during the winter season, as the earth lodge was  generally erected in an exposed situation, selected on account of  comfort in the summer. The tent could be pitched in the timber or brush,  or down in wooded ravines, where the cold winds never had full sweep.  Hence, many Indians abandoned their houses in winter and went into their  tents, even when they were of canvas.    [Illustration: Fig. 308.--Omaha"]]]
