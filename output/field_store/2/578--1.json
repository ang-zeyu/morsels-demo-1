(from \"The Road To Tycho\", a collection of articles  about the antecedents of the Lunarian Revolution,  published in Luna City in 2096)          For Dan Halbert, the road to Tycho began in college--when Lissa Lenz  asked to borrow his computer.  Hers had broken down, and unless she  could borrow another, she would fail her midterm project.  There was  no one she dared ask, except Dan.      This put Dan in a dilemma.  He had to help her--but if he lent her his  computer, she might read his books.  Aside from the fact that you  could go to prison for many years for letting someone else read your  books, the very idea shocked him at first.  Like everyone, he had been  taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and  wrong--something that only pirates would do.      And there wasn't much chance that the SPA--the Software Protection  Authority--would fail to catch him.  In his software class, Dan had  learned that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and  where it was read, and by whom, to Central Licensing.  (They used this  information to catch reading pirates, but also to sell personal  interest profiles to retailers.)  The next time his computer was  networked, Central Licensing would find out.  He, as computer owner,  would receive the harshest punishment--for not taking pains to prevent  the crime.      Of course, Lissa did not necessarily intend to read his books.  She  might want the computer only to write her midterm.  But Dan knew she  came from a middle-class family and could hardly afford the tuition,  let alone her reading fees.  Reading his books might be the only way  she could graduate.  He understood this situation; he himself had had  to borrow to pay for all the research papers he read.  (10% of those  fees went to the researchers who wrote the papers; since Dan aimed for  an academic career, he could hope that his own research papers, if  frequently referenced, would bring in enough to repay this loan.)      Later on, Dan would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the  library and read journal articles, and even books, without having to  pay.  There were independent scholars who read thousands of pages  without government library grants.  But in the 1990s, both commercial  and nonprofit journal publishers had begun charging fees for access.  By 2047, libraries offering free public access to scholarly literature  were a dim memory.      There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central  Licensing.  They were themselves illegal.  Dan had had a classmate in  software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool,  and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading  books.  But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them  turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were  easily tempted into betrayal).  In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for  pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.      Dan would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have  debugging tools.  There were even free debugging tools available on CD  or downloadable over the net.  But ordinary users started using them  to bypass copyright monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this  had become their principal use in actual practice.  This meant they  were illegal; the debuggers' developers were sent to prison.      Programmers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger  vendors in 2047 distributed numbered copies only, and only to  officially licensed and bonded programmers.  The debugger Dan used in  software class was kept behind a special firewall so that it could be  used only for class exercises.      It was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a  modified system kernel.  Dan would eventually find out about the free  kernels, even entire free operating systems, that had existed around  the turn of the century.  But not only were they illegal, like  debuggers--you could not install one if you had one, without knowing  your computer's root password.  And neither the FBI nor Microsoft  Support would tell you that.      Dan concluded that he couldn't simply lend Lissa his computer.  But he  couldn't refuse to help her, because he loved her.  Every chance to  speak with her filled him with delight.  And that she chose him to ask  for help, that could mean she loved him too.      Dan resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable--he  lent her the computer, and told her his password.  This way, if Lissa  read his books, Central Licensing would think he was reading them.  It  was still a crime, but the SPA would not automatically find out about  it.  They would only find out if Lissa reported him.      Of course, if the school ever found out that he had given Lissa his  own password, it would be curtains for both of them as students,  regardless of what she had used it for.  School policy was that any  interference with their means of monitoring students' computer use was  grounds for disciplinary action.  It didn't matter whether you did  anything harmful--the offense was making it hard for the  administrators to check on you.  They assumed this meant you were  doing something else forbidden, and they did not need to know what it  was.      Students were not usually expelled for this--not directly.  Instead  they were banned from the school computer systems, and would  inevitably fail all their classes.      Later, Dan would learn that this kind of university policy started  only in the 1980s, when university students in large numbers began  using computers.  Previously, universities maintained a different  approach to student discipline; they punished activities that were  harmful, not those that merely raised suspicion.      Lissa did not report Dan to the SPA.  His decision to help her led to  their marriage, and also led them to question what they had been  taught about piracy as children.  The couple began reading about the  history of copyright, about the Soviet Union and its restrictions on  copying, and even the original United States Constitution.  They moved  to Luna, where they found others who had likewise gravitated away from  the long arm of the SPA.  When the Tycho Uprising began in 2062, the  universal right to read soon became one of its central aims.      Author's Note      The right to read is a battle being fought today.  Although it may  take 50 years for our present way of life to fade into obscurity, most  of the specific laws and practices described above have already been  proposed--either by the Clinton Administration or by publishers.      There is one exception: the idea that the FBI and Microsoft will keep  the root passwords for personal computers.  This is an extrapolation  from the Clipper chip and similar Clinton Administration key-escrow  proposals, together with a long-term trend: computer systems are  increasingly set up to give absentee operators control over the people  actually using the computer system.      The SPA, which actually stands for Software Publisher's Association,  is not today an official police force.  Unofficially, it acts like  one.  It invites people to inform on their coworkers and friends; like  the Clinton Administration, it advocates a policy of collective  responsibility whereby computer owners must actively enforce copyright  or be punished.      The SPA is currently threatening small Internet service providers,  demanding they permit the SPA to monitor all users.  Most ISPs  surrender when threatened, because they cannot afford to fight back in  court.  (Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 1 Oct 96, D3.)  At least one  ISP, Community ConneXion in Oakland CA, refused the demand and was  actually sued.  The SPA is said to have  dropped this suit recently, but they are sure to continue the campaign  in various other ways.      The university security policies described above are not imaginary.  For example, a computer at one Chicago-area university prints this  message when you log in (quotation marks are in the original):      \"This system is for the use of authorized users only.  Individuals using  this computer system without authority or in the excess of their authority  are subject to having all their activities on this system monitored and  recorded by system personnel.  In the course of monitoring individuals  improperly using this system or in the course of system maintenance, the  activities of authorized user may also be monitored.  Anyone using this  system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such  monitoring reveals possible evidence of illegal activity or violation of  University regulations system personnel may provide the evidence of such  monitoring to University authorities and/or law enforcement officials.\"        This is an interesting approach to the Fourth Amendment: pressure most  everyone to agree, in advance, to waive their rights under it.

FOREWORD      In these little plays I have tried to bring before the public the two  dominant characteristics of the ideal Christmas season, kindness,  expressed by \"good will toward men,\" and the inward joy wrought by  kind acts, and suggested by \"peace on earth.\" As Yuletide draws near  we like to think of the swell of Christmas feeling, kindness, peace  and good will, that rises like a mighty tide over the world, filling  it with the fresh, clean joys and generous impulses that produce the  peace that passeth understanding.    Some of the plays are filled with the spirit of fun and jollity that  is always associated with Christmas merrymaking; in others I have  tried to emphasize the spiritual blessings brought to the children of  men on that first white Christmas night when Christ, the Lord, was  born in Bethlehem, and all the angels sang, \"Gloria in excelsis, peace  on earth, good will toward men.\"      CHILDREN IN PLAYS.    The love of mimetic representation, either as a participant or as a  spectator, is an ineradicable instinct of childhood and adolescence.  Most of these plays call for a somewhat large number of children. This  need not daunt the producer as the chief characters are few and many  of the parts have very few lines to speak. Many extra children may be  introduced in several of the plays, as a chorus. At Christmas time,  the children's season, it is best to allow all who so desire to take  part in the entertainment. Some of the parts are rather long, but all  have been played by children of the age indicated in the text. Very  little children have sometimes done remarkable work in the plays. I  remember one instance when a very tiny Tiny Tim, who was not four  years old, spoke his part correctly, was heard in every corner of the  church and acted with a naturalness that was indeed remarkable.      REHEARSALS.    First and foremost, do _not_ over-rehearse your play. The chief charm  in Christmas plays lies in their naturalness and simplicity, a part of  which is almost sure to be lost if they have rehearsed the play until  they have lost their wonder and excitement and enjoyment in the  make-believe game of amateur theatricals.    The director's aim should be to establish a happy co-operation with  the players that will make the whole production, rehearsals, dress  rehearsals and final performance, a series of good times crowned by a  happy, if not perfect, production. The director should always strive  to be cheerful and happy, ever ready to give advice and ever ready to  ask for advice, even from the youngest players. Take them into your  confidence. Discuss color schemes, costuming, property making,  lighting and scenic effects with your actors.    At the first rehearsal have the children listen to a reading of the  play. Then read a short scene in detail, allowing each actor to read  several parts. Try every child in every child's part before you make  your final selection of the cast of characters. If it is possible,  begin your second rehearsal on the stage where the play is to be  given. Arrange chairs to represent entrances, doors, windows, etc.,  and have all properties on hand, in order to impress on the children's  minds the necessity of learning the words and the action at the same  time. At the third rehearsal the play should be given in its entirety,  music, gestures, entrances, exits, groupings and crossing from one  side of the stage to another at a given cue, etc. In fact, everything  as in the completed production, except that the actors may use their  copies of the play for reading the lines.      DELAYS.    The director should make every effort to guard against stage waits and  delays of every sort. Have your stage hands, prompter, property  managers, scene painters and all your assistants on hand at every  rehearsal, if possible. Long waits between the acts, tardiness in  beginning the performance, and all delays do much to destroy an  otherwise happy impression. Every piece of scenery, every costume,  every bit of make-up and every property should be in its place--all  ready to make a smooth final performance. Dress rehearsals are  absolutely necessary. The last two rehearsals should be complete  performances of the play with lights, curtains, costumes, make-up,  scenery and all incidentals exactly as they are to be on the night of  the performance.    With such preparation, scarcely anything is impossible of attainment.  The pleasure of the work and the pride in a production well done will  amply repay an ungrudging lavishment of time and labor.

The earth has grown old with its burden of care,         But at Christmas it always is young,       The heart of the jewel burns lustrous and fair,       And its soul, full of music, bursts forth on the air,         When the song of the angels is sung.         It is coming, Old Earth, it is coming tonight!         On the snowflakes which cover thy sod       The feet of the Christ Child fall gentle and white,       And the voice of the Christ Child tells out with delight,         That mankind are the children of God.         On the sad and the lonely, the wretched and poor,         The voice of the Christ Child shall fall;       And to every blind wanderer open the door       Of hope that he dared not to dream of before,         With a sunshine of welcome for all.         --_Phillips Brooks._    And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from  Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing  was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria. And all went to be  taxed, every one into his own city.    And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,  into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because  he was of the house and"]]]
