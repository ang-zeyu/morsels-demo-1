With his long,  white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back  his left shirt-cuff.  For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully  upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with  innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home,  pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined  arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.    Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but  custom had not reconciled my mind to it.  On the contrary, from day to  day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled  nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to  protest.  Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver  my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant  air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would  care to take anything approaching to a liberty.  His great powers, his  masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many  extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing  him.    Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken  with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme  deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no  longer.    \"Which is it to-day?\" I asked,--\"morphine or cocaine?\"    He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he  had opened.  \"It is cocaine,\" he said,--\"a seven-per-cent. solution.  Would you care to try it?\"    \"No, indeed,\" I answered, brusquely.  \"My constitution has not got over  the Afghan campaign yet.  I cannot afford to throw any extra strain  upon it.\"    He smiled at my vehemence.  \"Perhaps you are right, Watson,\" he said.  \"I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one.  I find it,  however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that  its secondary action is a matter of small moment.\"    \"But consider!\" I said, earnestly.  \"Count the cost!  Your brain may,  as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid  process, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a  permanent weakness.  You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon  you.  Surely the game is hardly worth the candle.  Why should you, for  a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which  you have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to  another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to  some extent answerable.\"    He did not seem offended.  On the contrary, he put his finger-tips  together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who  has a relish for conversation.    \"My mind,\" he said, \"rebels at stagnation.  Give me problems, give me  work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate  analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere.  I can dispense then  with artificial stimulants.  But I abhor the dull routine of existence.  I crave for mental exaltation.  That is why I have chosen my own  particular profession,--or rather created it, for I am the only one in  the world.\"    \"The only unofficial detective?\" I said, raising my eyebrows.    \"The only unofficial consulting detective,\" he answered.  \"I am the  last and highest court of appeal in detection.  When Gregson or  Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths--which, by the way,  is their normal state--the matter is laid before me.  I examine the  data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion.  I claim no  credit in such cases.  My name figures in no newspaper.  The work  itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my  highest reward.  But you have yourself had some experience of my  methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said I, cordially.  \"I was never so struck by anything  in my life.  I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat  fantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet.'\"    He shook his head sadly.  \"I glanced over it,\" said he. \"Honestly, I  cannot congratulate you upon it.  Detection is, or ought to be, an  exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional  manner.  You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which  produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an  elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.\"    \"But the romance was there,\" I remonstrated.  \"I could not tamper with  the facts.\"    \"Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of  proportion should be observed in treating them.  The only point in the  case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from  effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it.\"    I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially  designed to please him.  I confess, too, that I was irritated by the  egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be  devoted to his own special doings.  More than once during the years  that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small  vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner.  I made no  remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg.  I had a Jezail bullet  through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from  walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.    \"My practice has extended recently to the Continent,\" said Holmes,  after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe.  \"I was consulted  last week by Francois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come  rather to the front lately in the French detective service.  He has all  the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide  range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments  of his art.  The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some  features of interest.  I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,  the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have  suggested to him the true solution.  Here is the letter which I had  this morning acknowledging my assistance.\"  He tossed over, as he  spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down  it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray  \"magnifiques,\" \"coup-de-maitres,\" and \"tours-de-force,\" all testifying  to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.    \"He speaks as a pupil to his master,\" said I.    \"Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,\" said Sherlock Holmes, lightly.  \"He has considerable gifts himself.  He possesses two out of the three  qualities necessary for the ideal detective.  He has the power of  observation and that of deduction.  He is only wanting in knowledge;  and that may come in time.  He is now translating my small works into  French.\"    \"Your works?\"    \"Oh, didn't you know?\" he cried, laughing.  \"Yes, I have been guilty of  several monographs.  They are all upon technical subjects.  Here, for  example, is one 'Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various  Tobaccoes.'  In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-,  cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the  difference in the ash.  It is a point which is continually turning up  in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a  clue.  If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has  been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously  narrows your field of search.  To the trained eye there is as much  difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff  of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.\"    \"You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae,\" I remarked.    \"I appreciate their importance.  Here is my monograph upon the tracing  of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a  preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the  influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the  hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and  diamond-polishers.  That is a matter of great practical interest to the  scientific detective,--especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in  discovering the antecedents of criminals.  But I weary you with my  hobby.\"    \"Not at all,\" I answered, earnestly.  \"It is of the greatest interest  to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your  practical application of it.  But you spoke just now of observation and  deduction.  Surely the one to some extent implies the other.\"    \"Why, hardly,\" he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair,  and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe.  \"For example,  observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street  Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there  you dispatched a telegram.\"    \"Right!\" said I.  \"Right on both points!  But I confess that I don't  see how you arrived at it.  It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I  have mentioned it to no one.\"    \"It is simplicity itself,\" he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,--\"so  absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may  serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction.  Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to  your instep.  Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken  up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that  it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering.  The earth is of  this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere  else in the neighborhood.  So much is observation.  The rest is  deduction.\"    \"How,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net            [Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected,  all other inconsistencies are as in the original.

This is especially  true of the matter here before us; because the southern extreme of  Africa, like to that of the American continent, has heretofore lain  far outside of the common interest, and therefore of the accurate  knowledge, of mankind at large. The Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn,  in themselves remote, tempestuous, and comparatively unproductive  regions, for centuries derived importance merely {p.002} from the  fact that by those ways alone the European world found access to the  shores of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The application of steam to  ocean navigation, and the opening of the Suez Canal, have greatly  modified conditions, by diverting travel from the two Capes to the  Canal and to the Straits of Magellan. It is only within a very few  years that South Africa, thus diminished in consequence as a station  upon a leading commercial highway, has received compensation by the  discovery of great mineral wealth.    Thus separated from the rest of the world, by lack of intrinsic value  as a region producing materials necessary to the common good, the  isolation of South Africa was further increased by physical  conditions, which not only retarded colonisation and development, but  powerfully affected the character and the mutual relations of the  European settlers. Portuguese mariners, after more than half a century  of painful groping downward along the West African coast in search of  a sea route to India that vague tradition asserted could there be  found, in 1486 rounded the Cape of Good Hope, which then received the  despondent name of {p.003} the Cape of Storms from its first  discoverer, Bartholomew Diaz.    Vasco da Gama, following him in 1497, gave to it its present  auspicious title, which was to him of sound augury; for he then passed  on to explore the East coast and to find the long-desired Indies. It  was, however, the latter which constituted the Portuguese goal. Africa  was to them primarily the half-way house, where to refresh their ships  on the long voyage to Hindustan, which then took near a year to  complete. For this purpose they established themselves on the island  of Mozambique, and gradually took possession of the country to this  day known as Portuguese East Africa.    From that far back settlement, Delagoa Bay, near the southern border,  is now a thorn in the side of the British invasion; a port with which  they are not at war, and therefore cannot seize or blockade, but  which, through the supplies that thence reach the otherwise isolated  Transvaal, contributes powerfully to support the defence.    Upon the heels of the Portuguese followed the Dutch, aiming like them  at the Far East, more {p.004} especially at what were then  comprehensively called the Spice Islands--the Moluccas. They also felt  the need of a half-way station. For this the Cape of Good Hope, with  the adjacent bays--Table Bay and False Bay--presented advantages; for  though not perfectly safe anchorages at all seasons, the voyage to the  islands is more expeditiously and healthfully made by starting from,  and keeping in, a far southern latitude, than by proceeding along the  East African coast.    In 1652 the Dutch settled at the Cape, and gradually extended their  holding to the eastward as far as the Great Fish River. A generation  later, in 1686, the population received an accession of French  Protestant refugees, leaving their country upon the revocation of the  Edict of Nantes. From these descended the late General Joubert,  Commander-in-Chief of the Transvaal forces at the opening of  hostilities. The administration of the colony by the Dutch East India  Company being both arbitrary and meddlesome, some of the more  independent spirits withdrew from the coast and moved inland, behind  the difficult {p.005} mountain ranges that separate the narrow strip  of sea-coast from the high table-lands of the interior.    In 1795 local dissatisfaction and the spread of French revolutionary  principles led to a revolt of the colonists, and Holland passing at  that time into alliance with France, the Cape was seized by a British  naval and military expedition. At the Peace of Amiens in 1802 it was  restored to Holland; but in the next war it was again taken by the  British, in 1806, and at the Peace of 1814 was confirmed in their  possession.    The population remained Dutch in blood and in tradition; but  subsequent accessions of English immigrants have established in Cape  Colony itself an approach to equilibrium between the two races, to  which has also contributed a series of emigrations to the interior by  the Dutch farmers, dissatisfied with various incidents of British  rule. Into the merits of these differences we have neither space nor  occasion to go.    In 1836, immediately prior to the largest of these movements, known as  the Great Trek, the British Government, by Act, extended its claim  {p.006} of control over all South Africa, south of 25 deg., the latitude  of Delagoa Bay; and the Boer emigrants were warned that in entering  that region they remained under British authority, unless they passed  on into the Portuguese dominion. From this Trek resulted directly, in  the course of years, the two Boer states, the Orange Free State and  the South African Republic (commonly called the Transvaal); and also,  indirectly, the easternmost British colony in South Africa, Natal, in  which the English element is decisively preponderant.    The mention of this migration leads naturally and immediately to a  summary of the physical conditions of the country, by which, as well  as by derivation of blood, the apartness of the two races has been  emphasized. Between the narrow margin of land belonging, as it were,  to the sea, and the high interior plateau, there runs from the extreme  west of the British dominions a chain of lofty mountains, parallel,  roughly, to the coastline, and terminating only when abreast of  Delagoa Bay. These reach an elevation of from six to eight thousand  feet, and in places on the border between {p.007} Natal and  Basutoland heights of eleven thousand are attained. On the side toward  the sea the ascent is comparatively rapid and difficult, though often  broken into precipitous terraces. Inland the descent is less, and more  regular, issuing in a plateau from three to five thousand feet above  the sea, and presenting almost throughout a comparatively level or  undulating surface that offers no serious difficulty to transit.    The territory of the Orange Free State and of the Transvaal lies  wholly within this table-land. In this region, and throughout Africa  south of 25 deg., there are river beds, but no navigable rivers. The  country is generally treeless, and there is a great deficiency of  steady natural water supply. During the rainy season, from October to  March, the naked ground fails to retard the running off of the waters,  which therefore escape rapidly by the rivers, swelling them to  momentary torrents that quickly and fruitlessly subside. During the  long dry season the exposed herbage dries to the roots.    From these conditions it results that not only is agriculture  generally impracticable, economically, but {p.008} that cattle and  sheep, the chief wealth of the Boer farmers, require an unusual  proportion of ground per head for pasture; and the mobility of bodies  of horsemen, expecting to subsist their beasts upon local pasturage,  is greatly affected by the seasons--an important military  consideration. The large holdings introduce large spaces between the  holders, who dwell therefore alone, each man with his family. So it  has come to pass that the descendants of one of the most mercantile  and gregarious of races, whose artists "]]]
