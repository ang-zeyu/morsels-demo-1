QUALITY COURT, CHANCERY LANE    _First Edition_--1920    _Second Edition_--1922    PRINTED BY WHITEHEAD BROTHERS, WOLVERHAMPTON.          THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY    TO THE HONOURABLE AND VERTUOUS LADY MISTRESS E. K. A.         MADAM,         It would be churlish indeed were I to send this book into the       world without some acknowledgment of the share which you have had       in its making. Indeed, I feel that you are chiefly responsible       for it: without your encouragement, your active help, your       patience with me at all times (at which I marvel constantly), it       would never have arrived at completion. Truly it is your name,       not mine, that should appear upon the title-page; for although       mine may have been the hand that penned the words, certain it is       that yours was the mind that guided my pen throughout. It is to       your sympathy, your judgment, your excellent taste, that I am       indebted for every good thing that I have penned; and where I       have put down aught that is trite or insipid, it is due to my       own natural obstinacy in refusing, or carelessness in neglecting,       to defer the matter to your better judgment. Thus it is only       right that whatever praise may be bestowed upon this book should       be accorded to you; my shoulders alone must bear the censure of       the discerning reader.                                          I am, Madam, your very dutiful,                                                    and loving husband,                                                            THE AUTHOR.          PREFACE           In placing this second edition before his fellow book-lovers, the       author would like to take the opportunity of thanking the       numerous correspondents who have written to him from all parts of       the world. In truth book-collecting establishes a bond between       its devotees that is effected by no other pursuit.         The first edition was put forth only after much hesitation, and       with a good deal of fear and trembling: that a second edition       would ever be required was unthinkable. But since the book has so       obviously been the means of bringing pleasure to so many, the       author feels that it is his duty to bring this second edition 'up       to date,' to make it as perfect as his poor skill allows.       Accordingly the volume has been revised throughout, a number of       additions have been made, both to the text and in the matter of       footnotes, and the prices of books have been amended according to       present conditions. Three illustrations have been added.       QUALITY COURT,       July, 1921.          CONTENTS    CHAP                                           PAGE     I.

CHAUCER.      IT is a sad truth that bargains are met with more frequently in our youth  than in our age. The sophist may argue that age begets philosophy, and  that philosophy contemns all worldly things; yet certain it is that the  book-hunter, one of the most philosophical of beings, remains on the  look-out for bargains to the very end of his career. Nevertheless, it is  a fact that in youth alone do we make those great bargains which lay the  foundations of our careers as book-hunters.    It is this sad truth which fosters in most of us the belief that we live  in a decadent age, and that the days of our youth were infinitely more  seemly than those which we now endure. But it is we who have changed: the  bargains are still there, and may still be had at the cost of youthful  energy and enthusiasm.    'Ah, but you can't get the bargains nowadays that you could when I was a  young man,' says the elderly bookseller, with a knowing shake of his  head. Can't you! Then mankind must have changed strangely since the  period of this sage's youth. Bargains, and rich ones too, in everything  that is bought and sold, are made every day and will continue to be made  so long as human nature endures, bargains in books no less among them.    The rich finds of which the aged bookseller dreams are bargains only in  the light of present-day prices. As a matter of fact, the great majority  of them were not really bargains at all. He may bitterly lament having  parted with a copy of the first edition of the 'Compleat Angler,' in the  'sixties for twenty guineas, but he overlooks the fact that that was then  its market value. Had he asked a thousand pounds for it, his sanity would  certainly have been open to question. 'Why, when I was a boy,' he says,  'you could buy first editions of Shelley, Keats, or Scott for pence.'  Precisely: which was their current value; by no stretch of the  imagination can they be considered bargains. His business is, and has  always been, to buy and sell; not to hoard books on the chance that they  will become valuable 'some day.' Neither can it be urged that 'people'  (by which he means collectors) 'did not know so much about books fifty  years ago.' Collectors know, and have ever known, all that they need for  the acquisition of their particular _desiderata_. If they were ignorant  of the prices which volumes common in their day would realise at some  future period, why, so were the dealers and every one else concerned!  Judging by analogy, we have every reason to believe that many volumes  which we come across almost daily on the bookstalls, marked, perhaps, a  few pence, will be fought for one day across the auction-room table.    The chief reason why the elderly bookseller no longer comes across these  advantageous purchases is that he has passed the age (though he does not  know it) at which bargains are to be had. But bargains are not  encountered, they are made. It is the youthful vigour and enthusiasm of  the young collector, prompting him into the byways and alleys of  book-land, that bring bargains to his shelves.    So, if you are young and enthusiastic, and not to be deterred by a series  of wild-goose chases, happy indeed will be your lot. For over the  post-prandial pipe you will be able to hand such and such a treasure to  your admiring fellow-spirit, saying: 'This I picked up for _n_-pence in  Camden Town; this one cost me _x_-shillings at Poynder's in Reading:  Iredale of Torquay let me have this for a florin; I found this on the  floor in a corner of Commin's shop at Bournemouth; this was on David's  stall at Cambridge, and I nearly lost it to the fat don of King's'; and  so on and so on.    Bargains, forsooth! Our book-hunter was once outbid at Sotheby's for a  scarce volume which he found, a week later, on a barrow in Clerkenwell  for fourpence! The same year he picked up for ten shillings, in London,  an early sixteenth-century folio, rubricated and with illuminated  initials. It was as fresh as when it issued from the press, and in the  original oak and pig-skin binding. He failed to trace the work in any of  the bibliographies, nor could the British Museum help him to locate  another copy. David's stall at Cambridge once yielded to him a scarce  Defoe tract for sixpence. But this being, as Master Pepys said, 'an idle  rogueish book,' he sold it to a bookseller for two pounds, 'that it might  not stand in the list of books, nor among them, to disgrace them, if it  should be found.' A copy has recently fetched twenty guineas.    Doubtless every bibliophile is perpetually on the look-out for treasures,  and it is essential that he learn, early in his career, to make up his  mind at once concerning an out-of-the-way book. He who hesitates is lost,  and this is doubly true of the book-collector. More than once in his  early days of collecting has our book-hunter hesitated and finally left a  book, only to dash back--perhaps a few hours later, perhaps next day--and  find it gone.    Once upon a time a spotlessly clean little square octavo volume of  Terence, printed in italics, caught his eye upon a bookstall. One  shilling was its ransom, but it was not the price that deterred him so  much as the fact that every available nook and corner of his sanctum was  already filled to overflowing with books. 'A nice clean copy of an  early-printed book,' he mused. But early-printed books were not in his  line--then; had they been in those early days of book-hunting, his  library would have been slow indeed of growth. So he passed on and left  it.    All that evening the memory of the little square volume would keep  recurring most absurdly. He didn't want it, it was not in his line, he  would never read it, and so on and so on. But over his pipe that evening  the colophon '. . . . _studio & impensis Philippi de Giunta florentini  . . ., 1505_,' came back to his memory; he must have been mad not to have  bought it at that price, and such a fine copy too. And so to bed, sorely  harassed in his bibliophilic mind.

P. PUTNAM'S SONS  NEW YORK AND LONDON  The Knickerbocker Press  1906          Copyright, 1906  by  G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS          PREFACE.      For years the makers of this book have spent the summer time in  wandering about the French country; led here by the fame of some old  monument, or there by an incident of history. They have found the real,  unspoiled France, often unexplored by any except the French themselves,  and practically unknown to foreigners, even to the ubiquitous maker of  guide-books. For weeks together they have travelled without meeting an  English-speaking person. It is, therefore, not surprising that they were  unable to find, in any convenient form in English, a book telling of the  Cathedrals of the South which was at once accurate and complete. For the  Cathedrals of that country are monuments not only of architecture and  its history, but of the history of peoples, the psychology of the  christianising and unifying of the barbarian and the Gallo-Roman, and  many things besides, epitomised perhaps in the old words, \"the struggle  between the world, the flesh, and the devil.\" In French, works on  Cathedrals are numerous and exhaustive; but either so voluminous as to  be unpractical except for the specialist--as the volumes of  Viollet-le-Duc,--or so technical as to make each Cathedral seem one in  an endless, monotonous procession, differing from the others only in  size, style, and age. This is distinctly unfair to these old churches  which have personalities and idiosyncrasies as real as those of  individuals. It has been the aim of the makers of this book to  introduce, in photograph and in story,--not critically or exhaustively,  but suggestively and accurately,--the Cathedral of the Mediterranean  provinces as it exists to-day with its peculiar characteristics of  architecture and history. They have described only churches which they  have seen, they have verified every fact and date where such  verification was possible, and have depended on local tradition only  where that was all which remained to tell of the past; and they will  feel abundantly repaid for travel, research, and patient exploration of  towers, crypts, and archives if the leisurely traveller on pleasure bent  shall find in these volumes but a hint of the interest and fascination  which the glorious architecture, the history, and the unmatched climate  of the Southland can awaken.    For unfailing courtesy and untiring interest, for free access to private  as well as to ecclesiastical libraries, for permission to photograph and  copy, for unbounding hospitality and the retelling of many an old  legend, their most grateful thanks are due to the Catholic clergy, from  Archbishop to Cure and Vicar. For rare old bits of information, for  historical verification, and for infinite pains in accuracy of printed  matter, they owe warm thanks to Mrs. Wilbur Rose, to Miss Frances Kyle,  and to Mrs. William H. Shelmire, Jr. For criticism and training in the  art of photographing they owe no less grateful acknowledgment to Mr.  John G. Bullock and Mr. Charles R. Pancoast.    E. W. R.    V. H. F.
