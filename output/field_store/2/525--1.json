THE EARLY BRITONS TO KING JOHN          TO WHICH IS PREFIXED    A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE.    WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.          THE LIFE OF DAVID HUME, ESQ.    WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.      MY OWN LIFE.    It is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity;  therefore I shall be short. It may be thought an instance of vanity  that I pretend at all to write my life; but this narrative shall contain  little more than the history of my writings; as, indeed, almost all  my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupations. The first  success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object of  vanity.    I was born the twenty-sixth of April, 1711, old style, at Edinburgh. I  was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is  a branch of the earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my ancestors had been  proprietors of the estate which my brother possesses, for several  generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, president of  the college of justice; the title of Lord Halkerton came by succession  to her brother.    My family, however, was not rich; and being myself a younger brother,  my patrimony, according to the mode of my country, was of course very  slender. My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was an  infant, leaving me, with an elder brother and a sister, under the  care of our mother, a woman of singular merit, who, though young and  handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of  her children. I passed through the ordinary course of education with  success, and was seized very early with a passion for literature, which  has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my  enjoyments. My studious disposition, my sobriety, and my industry, gave  my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me; but  I found an insurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of  philosophy and general learning; and while they fancied I was poring  upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was  secretly devouring.    My very slender fortune, however, being unsuitable to this plan of life,  and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I was  tempted, or rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for entering  into a more active scene of life. In 1734, I went to Bristol, with some  recommendations to several eminent merchants; but in a few months found  that scene totally unsuitable to me. I went over to France, with a view  of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat; and I there laid that  plan of life which I have steadily and successfully pursued. I resolved  to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to  maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as  contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature.    During my retreat in France, first at Rheims, but chiefly at La Fleche,  in Anjou, I composed my Treatise of Human Nature. After passing three  years very agreeably in that country, I came over to London in 1737. In  the end of 1738, I published my Treatise, and immediately went down  to my mother and my brother, who lived at his country house, and was  employing himself very judiciously and successfully in the improvement  of his fortune.    Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of  Human Nature. It fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such  distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being  naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I very soon recovered the  blow, and prosecuted with great ardor my studies in the country. In  1742, I printed at Edinburgh the first part of my Essays. The work  was favorably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former  disappointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country,  and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I  had too much neglected in my early youth.    In 1745, I received a letter from the marquis of Annandale, inviting me  to come and live with him in England; I found also that the friends and  family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care  and direction, for the state of his mind and health required it. I  lived with him a twelve-month. My appointments during that time made  a considerable accession to my small fortune. I then received an  invitation from General St. Clair to attend him as a secretary to his  expedition, which was at first meant against Canada, but ended in an  incursion on the coast of France. Next year, to wit, 1747, I received  an invitation from the general to attend him in the same station in  his military embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the  uniform of an officer, and was introduced at these courts as aid-de-camp  to the general, along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, now  General Grant. These two years were almost the only interruptions which  my studies have received during the course of my life: I passed them  agreeably, and in good company; and my appointments, with my frugality,  had made me reach a fortune which I called independent, though most of  my friends were inclined to smile when I said so: in short, I was now  master of near a thousand pounds.    I had always entertained a notion, that my want of success in publishing  the Treatise of Human Nature had proceeded more from the manner than  the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in  going to the press too early. I, therefore, cast the first part of  that work anew in the Inquiry concerning Human Understanding, which was  published while I was at Turin. But this piece was at first little more  successful than the Treatise on Human Nature. On my return from Italy,  I had the mortification to find all England in a ferment, on account  of Dr. Middleton's Free Inquiry, while my performance was entirely  overlooked and neglected, A new edition, which had been published at  London, of my Essays, moral and political, met not with a much better  reception.    Such is the force of natural temper, that these disappointments made  little or no impression on me. I went down, in 1749, and lived two years  with my brother at his country house, for my mother was now dead. I  there composed the second part of my Essay, which I called Political  Discourses, and also my Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals,  which is another part of my Treatise that I cast anew. Meanwhile, my  bookseller, A. Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all  but the unfortunate Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of  conversation; that the sale of them was gradually increasing, and that  new editions were demanded. Answers by reverends and right reverends  came out two or three in a year; and I found, by Dr. Warburton's  railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company.  However, I had fixed a resolution, which I inflexibly maintained, never  to reply to any body; and not being very irascible in my temper, I have  easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These symptoms of a  rising reputation gave me encouragement, as I was ever more disposed to  see the favorable than unfavorable side of things; a turn of mind  which it is more happy to possess, than to be born to an estate of ten  thousand a year.    In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true scene for a  man of letters. In 1752 were published at Edinburgh, where I then lived,  my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful on  the first publication. It was well received at home and abroad. In the  same year was published, at London, my Inquiry concerning the Principles  of Morals; which, in my own opinion, (who ought not to judge on  that subject,) is, of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or  literary, incomparably the best, It came unnoticed and unobserved into  the world.    In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates chose me their librarian, an office  from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the  command of a large library, I then formed the plan of writing the  History of England; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a  narrative through a period of seventeen hundred years, I commenced with  the accession of the house of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the  misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own,  sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work. I thought  that I was the only historian that had at once neglected present power,  interest, and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices; and as the  subject was suited to every capacity, I expected proportional applause.  But miserable was my disappointment; I was assailed by one cry of  reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation; English, Scotch,  and Irish, whig and tory, churchman and sectary, freethinker and  religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage against the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19212"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part B.

TO RICHARD III.          CHAPTER XII.    [Illustration: 1_155_henry3.jpg HENRY III.]          HENRY III.      {1216.} Most sciences, in proportion as they increase and improve,  invent methods by which they facilitate their reasonings, and, employing  general theorems, are enabled to comprehend, in a few propositions,  a great number of inferences and conclusions. History, also, being a  collection of facts which are multiplying without end, is obliged to  adopt such arts of abridgment, to retain the more material events, and  to drop all the minute circumstances, which are only interesting during  the time, or to the persons engaged in the transactions. This truth is  nowhere more evident than with regard to the reign upon which we are  going to enter. What mortal could have the patience to write or read a  long detail of such frivolous events as those with which it is filled,  or attend to a tedious narrative which would follow, through a series  of fifty-six years, the caprices and weaknesses of so mean a prince as  Henry? The chief reason why Protestant writers have been so anxious  to spread out the incidents of this reign, is in order to expose the  rapacity, ambition, and artifices of the court of Rome, and to prove,  that the great dignitaries of the Catholic church, while they pretended  to have nothing in view but the salvation of souls, had bent all their  attention to the acquisition of riches, and were restrained by no sense  of justice or of honor in the pursuit of that great object.[*] But this  conclusion would readily be allowed them, though it were not illustrated  by such a detail of uninteresting incidents; and follows indeed, by  an evident necessity, from the very situation in which that church  was placed with regard to the rest of Europe. For, besides that  ecclesiastical power, as it can always cover its operations under a  cloak of sanctity, and attacks men on the side where they dare not  employ their reason, lies less under control than civil government;  besides this general cause, I say, the pope and his courtiers were  foreigners to most of the churches which they governed; they could not  possibly have any other object than to pillage the provinces for present  gain; and as they lived at a distance, they would be little awed by  shame or remorse in employing every lucrative expedient which was  suggested to them. England being one of the most remote provinces  attached to the Romish hierarchy, as well as the most prone to  superstition, felt severely, during this reign, while its patience was  not yet fully exhausted, the influence of these causes, and we shall  often have occasion to touch cursorily upon such incidents. But we shall  not attempt to comprehend every transaction transmitted to us: and till  the end of the reign, when the events become more memorable, we shall  not always observe an exact chronological order in our narration.         * M. Paris, p. 623.    The earl of Pembroke, who at the time of John's death, was mareschal  of England, was, by his office, at the head of the armies, and  consequently, during a state of civil wars and convulsions, at the head  of the government; and it happened, fortunately for the young monarch  and for the nation, that the power could not have been intrusted into  more able and more faithful hands. This nobleman, who had maintained  his loyalty unshaken to John during the lowest fortune of that monarch,  determined to support the authority of the infant prince; nor was he  dismayed at the number and violence of his enemies. Sensible that  Henry, agreeably to the prejudices of the times, would not be deemed  a sovereign till crowned and anointed by a churchman, he immediately  carried the young prince to Glocester, where the ceremony of coronation  was performed, in the presence of Gualo, the legate, and of a few  noblemen, by the bishops of Winchester and Bath.[*] As the concurrence  of the papal authority was requisite to support the tottering throne,  Henry was obliged to swear fealty to the pope, and renew that homage to  which his father had already subjected the kingdom:[**] and in order to  enlarge the authority of Pembroke, and to give him a more regular  and legal title to it, a general council of the barons was soon after  summoned at Bristol, where that nobleman was chosen protector of the  realm.         * M. Paris, p. 290. Hist Croyl. Cont. p. 474. W. Heming. p.       562. Privet, p. 168.         ** M. Paris, p. 200.    Pembroke, that he might reconcile all men to the government of his  pupil, made him grant a new charter of liberties, which, though mostly  copied from the former concessions extorted from John, contains some  alterations which may be deemed remarkable.[*] The full privilege of  elections in the clergy, granted by the late king, was not confirmed,  nor the liberty of going out of the kingdom without the royal consent:  whence we may conclude, that Pembroke and the barons, jealous of the  ecclesiastical power, both were desirous of renewing the king's claim  to issue a conge d'elire to the monks and chapters, and thought it  requisite to put some check to the frequent appeals to Rome. But what  may chiefly surprise us is, that the obligation to which John had  subjected himself, of obtaining the consent of the great council before  he levied any aids or scutages upon the nation, was omitted; and this  article was even declared hard and severe, and was expressly left to  future deliberation. But we must consider, that, though this limitation  may perhaps appear to us the most momentous in the whole charter of  John, it was not regarded in that light by the ancient barons, who were  more jealous in guarding against particular acts of violence in the  crown than against such general impositions which, unless they were  evidently reasonable and necessary, could scarcely, without general  consent, be levied upon men who had arms in their hands, and who could  repel any act of oppression by which they were all immediately affected.  We accordingly find, that Henry, in the course of his reign, while he  gave frequent occasions for complaint with regard to his violations of  the Great Charter, never attempted, by his own will, to levy any aids  or scutages, though he was often reduced to great necessities, and was  refused supply by his people.         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 215.    So much easier was it for him to transgress the law, when individuals  alone were affected, than even to exert his acknowledged prerogatives,  where the interest of the whole body was concerned.    This charter was again confirmed by the king in the ensuing year, with  the addition of some articles to prevent the oppressions by sheriffs;  and also with an additional charter of forests, a circumstance of great  moment in those ages, when hunting was so much the occupation of the  nobility, and when the king comprehended so considerable a part of the  kingdom within his forests, which he governed by peculiar and arbitrary  laws. All the forests, which had been enclosed since the reign of Henry  II., were disafforested, and new perambulations were appointed for that  purpose; offences in the forests were declared to be no longer capital,  but punishable by fine, imprisonment, and more gentle penalties; and all  the proprietors of land recovered the power of cutting and using their  own wood at their pleasure.    Thus these famous charters were brought nearly to the shape in which  they have ever since stood; and they were, during many generations, the  peculiar favorites of the English nation, and esteemed the most sacred  rampart to national liberty and independence. As they secured the rights  of all orders of men, they were anxiously defended by all, and became  the basis, in a manner, of the English monarchy, and a kind of original  contract which both limited the authority of the king and insured the  conditional allegiance of his subjects. Though often violated, they  were still claimed by the nobility and people; and as no precedents  were supposed valid that infringed them, they rather acquired than lost  authority, from the frequent attempts made against them in several ages  by regal and arbitrary power.    While Pembroke, by renewing and confirming the Great Charter, gave so  much satisfaction and security to the nation in general, he also applied  himself successfully to individuals; he wrote letters, in the king's  name, to all the malcontent barons; in which he represented to them  that, whatever jealousy and animosity they might have entertained  against the late king, a young prince, the lineal heir of their ancient  monarchs, had now succeeded to the throne, without succeeding either  to the resentments or principles of his predecessor; that the desperate  expedient, which they had employed, of calling in a foreign potentate,  had, happily for them as well as for the nation, failed of entire  success, and it was still in their power, by a speedy return to their  duty, to restore the independence of the kingdom, and to secure that  liberty for which they so zealously"]]]
