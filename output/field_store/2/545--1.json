Dickens gave his first formal expression to his Christmas thoughts in  his series of small books, the first of which was the famous \"Christmas  Carol,\" the one perfect chrysolite. The success of the book was  immediate. Thackeray wrote of it: \"Who can listen to objections  regarding such a book as this? It seems to me a national benefit, and to  every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness.\"    This volume was put forth in a very attractive manner, with  illustrations by John Leech, who was the first artist to make these  characters live, and his drawings were varied and spirited.    There followed upon this four others: \"The Chimes,\" \"The Cricket on the  Hearth,\" \"The Battle of Life,\" and \"The Haunted Man,\" with illustrations  on their first appearance by Doyle, Maclise, and others. The five are  known to-day as the \"Christmas Books.\" Of them all the \"Carol\" is the  best known and loved, and \"The Cricket on the Hearth,\" although third in  the series, is perhaps next in point of popularity, and is especially  familiar to Americans through Joseph Jefferson's characterisation of  Caleb Plummer.    Dickens seems to have put his whole self into these glowing little  stories. Whoever sees but a clever ghost story in the \"Christmas Carol\"  misses its chief charm and lesson, for there is a different meaning in  the movements of Scrooge and his attendant spirits. A new life is  brought to Scrooge when he, \"running to his window, opened it and put  out his head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring cold;  cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sun-light; Heavenly sky;  sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!\" All this  brightness has its attendant shadow, and deep from the childish heart  comes that true note of pathos, the ever memorable toast of Tiny Tim,  \"God bless Us, Every One!\" \"The Cricket on the Hearth\" strikes a  different note. Charmingly, poetically, the sweet chirping of the little  cricket is associated with human feelings and actions, and at the crisis  of the story decides the fate and fortune of the carrier and his wife.    Dickens's greatest gift was characterization, and no English writer,  save Shakespeare, has drawn so many and so varied characters. It would  be as absurd to interpret all of these as caricatures as to deny Dickens  his great and varied powers of creation. Dickens exaggerated many of his  comic and satirical characters, as was his right, for caricature and  satire are very closely related, while exaggeration is the very essence  of comedy. But there remains a host of characters marked by humour and  pathos. Yet the pictorial presentation of Dickens's characters has ever  tended toward the grotesque. The interpretations in this volume aim to  eliminate the grosser phases of the caricature in favour of the more  human. If the interpretations seem novel, if Scrooge be not as he has  been pictured, it is because a more human Scrooge was desired--a Scrooge  not wholly bad, a Scrooge of a better heart, a Scrooge to whom the  resurrection described in this story was possible. It has been the  illustrator's whole aim to make these people live in some form more  fully consistent with their types.

There is no doubt whatever about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the  undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name  was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old  Marley was as dead as a door-nail.    Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there  is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined,  myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in  the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my  unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You  will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as  dead as a door-nail.    Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?  Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge  was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his  sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even  Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was  an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and  solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.    The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started  from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly  understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to  relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's Father died  before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his  taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,  than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning  out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Church-yard, for  instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.    Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years  afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was  known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called  Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It  was all the same to him.    Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a  squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old  sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out  generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.  The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,  shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin  lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime  was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his  own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the  dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.    External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could  warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than  he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain  less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The  heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the  advantage over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"  handsomely and Scrooge never did.    Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My  dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\" No beggars  implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was  o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to  such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to  know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into  doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they  said, \"No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"    But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his  way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep  its distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.    Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas  Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,  biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court  outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,  and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City  clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had  not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the  neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The  fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense  without, that,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#1)"],[1,"IN MUSIC FORM    A MANUAL OF ANALYSIS      OF ALL THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS AND DESIGNS    EMPLOYED IN MUSICAL COMPOSITION        BY    PERCY GOETSCHIUS, MUS.

It undertakes the thorough explanation of each design or form, from the  smallest to the largest; and such comparison as serves to demonstrate  the principle of natural evolution, in the operation of which the  entire system originates.

THE NECESSITY OF FORM IN MUSIC.--So much uncertainty and diversity of  opinion exists among music lovers of every grade concerning the  presence of Form in musical composition, and the necessity of its  presence there, that a few general principles are submitted at the  outset of our studies, as a guide to individual reflection and judgment  on the subject.    Certain apparently defensible prejudices that prevail in the minds of  even advanced musical critics against the idea of Form in music,  originate in a very manifest mistake on the part of the \"formalists\"  themselves, who (I refer to unimpassioned theorists and advocates of  rigid old scholastic rules) place too narrow a construction upon Form,  and define it with such rigor as to leave no margin whatever for the  exercise of free fancy and emotional sway.  Both the dreamer, with his  indifference to (or downright scorn of) Form; and the pedant, with his  narrow conception of it; as well as the ordinary music lover, with his  endeavor to discover some less debatable view to adopt for his own  everyday use,--need to be reminded _that Form in music means simply  Order in music_.    Thus interpreted, the necessity of form, that is, Order, in the  execution of a musical design appears as obvious as are the laws of  architecture to the builder, or the laws of creation to the astronomer  or naturalist; for the absence of order, that is, Disorder, constitutes  a condition which is regarded with abhorrence and dread by every  rational mind.    A musical composition, then, in which Order prevails; in which all the  factors are chosen and treated in close keeping with their logical  bearing upon each other and upon the whole; in which, in a word, there  is no disorder of thought or technique,--is music with Form (_i.e._  good Form).  A sensible arrangement of the various members of the  composition (its figures, phrases, motives, and the like) will exhibit  both agreement and contrast, both confirmation and opposition; for we  measure things by comparison with both like and unlike.  Our nature  demands the evidence of _uniformity_, as that emphasizes the  impressions, making them easier to grasp and enjoy; but our nature also  craves a certain degree of _variety_, to counteract the monotony which  must result from too persistent uniformity.  When the elements of Unity  and Variety are sensibly matched, evenly balanced, the form is good.  On the other hand, a composition is formless, or faulty in form, when  the component parts are jumbled together without regard to proportion  and relation.    Which of these two conditions is the more desirable, or necessary,  would seem to be wholly self-evident.    The error made by pedantic teachers is to demand _too much_ Form; to  insist that a piece of music shall be a model of arithmetical  adjustment.  This is probably a graver error than apparent  formlessness.  Design and logic and unity there must surely be; but any  _obtrusive_ evidence of mathematical calculation must degrade music to  the level of a mere handicraft.          *      *      *      *      *      *    Another and higher significance involved in the idea of Form, that goes  to prove how indispensable it may be in truly good music, rests upon  the opposition of Form to the material.    There are two essentially different classes of music lovers:--the one  class takes delight in the mere sound and jingle of the music; not  looking for any higher purpose than this, they content themselves with  the purely sensuous enjoyment that the sound material affords.  To such  listeners, a comparatively meaningless succession of tones and chords  is sufficiently enjoyable, so long as each separate particle, each beat  or measure, is euphonious in itself.  The other class, more  discriminating in its tastes, looks beneath this iridescent surface and  strives to fathom the underlying _purpose_ of it all; not content with  the testimony of the ear alone, such hearers enlist the higher, nobler  powers of Reason, and no amount of pleasant sounds could compensate  them for the absence of well-ordered parts and their logical  justification.    This second class is made up of those listeners who recognize in music  an embodiment of artistic aims, an object of serious and refined  enjoyment _that appeals to the emotions through the intelligence_,--not  a plaything for the senses alone; and who believe that all music that  would in this sense be truly artistic, must exhibit \"Form\" as the end,  and \"Material\" only as a means to this end.          *      *      *  "]]]
