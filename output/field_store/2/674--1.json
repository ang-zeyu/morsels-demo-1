Mr Rogers is a British settler in  South Africa, a \"cottage farmer\".  The earlier Dutch farmers and  settlers are called Boers.  The two teenage sons, Jack and Dick, have  often asked if they could all go out on a trek to visit the northern  parts of the country, for a natural history collecting expedition.  They  had come out to South Africa for the health of Mrs Rogers, but she had  died, and of the two boys, Dick was not very strong, while Jack was very  robust.    Off they go, together with two Zulu boys who live on their land, the  Zulu boys' father, who is a Chieftain whom they nickname \"The General\",  and an Irish cook, who is always getting into trouble in every  situation, in a most infuriating manner.  There is also Peter the  driver, and Dirk who is a foreloper, the man who walks ahead of the oxen  to guide them into the best way.    They expect to pay for the trip with ivory from elephants, feathers from  ostriches, animal skins, etc.    The various adventures include encounters with snakes, rhino, hippo,  giraffes, elephants, crocodiles, cataracts, tsetse fly, marauding native  tribes, a bush fire, hundreds of miles of dreary grinding effort taking  many months just to cover the ground, scorching heat, and sometimes  cold.  And more besides.    As usual with this author there is sustained tension throughout the  book.  An interesting and instructive book.    ________________________________________________________________________    OFF TO THE WILDS, BEING THE ADVENTURES OF TWO BROTHERS, BY GEORGE  MANVILLE FENN.      CHAPTER ONE.    COFFEE AND CHICORY, BUT NOT FOR BREAKFAST.    \"Just look at him, Dick.  Be quiet; don't speak.\"    \"Oh, the dirty sunburnt little varmint!  I'd like the job o' washing  him.\"    \"If you say another word, Dinny, I'll give you a crack with your own  stick.\"    \"An' is it meself would belave you'd hurt your own man Dinny wid a  shtick, Masther Jack?  Why ye wouldn't knock a fly off me.\"    \"Then be quiet.  I want to see what he's going to do.\"    \"Shure an' it's one of the masther's owld boots I threw away wid me own  hands this morning, because it hadn't a bit more wear in it.  An' look  at the dirty unclane monkey now.\"    \"He'll hear you directly, Dinny, and I want to see what he's going to  do.  Hold your tongue.\"    \"Shure an' ye ask me so politely, Masther Jack, that it's obliged to be  silent I am.\"    \"Pa was quite right when he said you had got too long a tongue.\"    \"Who said so, Masther Jack?\"    \"Pa--papa!\"    \"Shure the masther said--and it's meself heard him--that you was to lave  your papa at home in owld England, and that when ye came into these  savage parts of the wide world, it was to be father.\"    \"Well, father, then.  Now hold your tongue.  Just look at him, Dick.\"    \"It's meself won't spake again for an hour, and not then if they don't  ax me to,\" said Dennis Riley, generally known as \"Dinny,\" and nothing  more.  And he, too, joined in watching the \"unclane little savage,\" as  he called him, to wit, a handsome, well-grown Zulu lad, whose skin was  of a rich brown, and who, like his companion, seemed to be a model of  savage health and grace.    For there were two of these lads, exceedingly lightly clad, in a  necklace, and a strip of skin round the loins, one of whom was lying on  his chest with his chin resting upon his hands, kicking up his feet, and  clapping them together as he watched the other, who was evidently in a  high state of delight over an old boot.    This boot he had found thrown out in the fenced-in yard at the back of  the cottage, and he was now seated upon a bank trying it on.    First, he drew it on with a most serious aspect, held out his leg and  gave it a shake, when, finding the boot too loose, he took it off and  filled the toe with sand; but as the sand ran out of a gap between the  upper leather and the sole close to the toe and as fast as he put it in,  he had to look out for something else, which he found in the shape of  some coarse dry grass.  With this he half filled the boot, and then,  with a good deal of difficulty, managed to wriggle in his toes, after  which he drew the boot above his ankle, rose up with a smile of  gratified pride upon his countenance, and began to strut up and down  before his companion.    There was something very laughable in the scene, for it did not seem to  occur to the Zulu boy that he required anything else to add to his  costume.  He had on one English boot, the same as the white men wore,  and that seemed to him sufficient, as he stuck his arms akimbo, then  folded them as he walked with head erect, and ended by standing on one  leg and holding out the booted foot before his admiring companion.  This  was too much for the other boy, whose eyes glittered as he made a snatch  at the boot, dragged it off, and was about to leap up and run away; but  his victim was too quick, for, lithe and active as a serpent, he dashed  upon the would-be robber, and a fierce struggle ensued for the  possession of the boot.    John Rogers, otherwise Jack, a frank English lad of about sixteen,  sprang forward to separate the combatants, but Dinny, his father's  servant, who had been groom and gardener at home, restrained him.    \"No, no, Masther Jack,\" he cried, \"let the young haythens fight it out.  It'll make them behave betther by-an'-by.\"    \"I won't; I don't like to see them fight,\" cried Jack, slipping himself  free, and seemingly joining in the fray.    \"Don't, Masther Jack,\" cried Dinny; \"they'll come off black on your  hands.  Masther Dick, sir, tell him to lave them alone.\"    The lad appealed to, a pale delicate-looking youth, clenched his fists  and sprang forward to help his brother.  But he stopped directly and  began to laugh, as, after a short scuffle, Jack Rogers separated the  combatants, and stood between them with the boot in dispute.    For a moment it seemed as if the two Zulu lads were about to make a  combined attack, but there was something about the English lad which  restrained them, and they stood chattering away in their native tongue,  protesting against his interference, and each laying claim to the boot.    \"Speak English,\" cried Jack.  \"And now you two have got to shake hands  like Englishmen, and make friends.\"    \"Want a boot! want a boot! want a boot!\" the Zulu lads kept repeating.    \"Well, you do as I tell you, and you shall each have a pair of boots.\"    \"Two boot?  Two boot?\" cried the boy who had lost his treasure.    \"Yes; two boots,\" said Jack.  \"You've got an old pair, haven't you,  Dick?\"    \"Yes; they can have my old ones,\" was the reply.  \"Go and get them,  Dinny.\"    \"And my old lace-ups too,\" said Jack.    \"Ugh!\" ejaculated Dinny, spitting on the ground in token of disgust.  \"Ye'll both repint being such friends with cannibal savages like them,  young gentlemen.  They'll turn round on ye some day, and rend and ate ye  both.\"    \"Not they, Dinny,\" laughed Jack.  \"They'd prefer Irishmen, so we should  be safe if you were there.\"    \"Ah, ye may laugh,\" said Dinny, \"but they're a dangerous lot, them  savages, and I wouldn't trust 'em the length of my fut.\"    Dinny went towards the back door of Mr Rogers' roomy,  verandah-surrounded cottage farm, high up in the slopes of the  Drakensberg, and looking a perfect bower with its flowers, creepers, and  fruit-trees, many being old English friends; and Jack proceeded to make  peace between the two Zulu boys.    \"Now look here, Sepopo, you've got to shake hands with your brother,\" he  cried.    \"No!\" cried the Zulu boy who had been lying down when he snatched the  boot, and he threw himself in a monkey-like attitude on all fours.    \"Now you, Bechele, you've got to make friends and shake hands,\"  continued Jack, paying no heed to Sepopo's defiant attitude.    \"No!\" cried the last-addressed, emphatically.  \"'Tole a boot!  'Tole a  boot!\"  And he too plumped himself down upon all fours and stared at the  ground.    \"I say yes!\" cried Jack; when, as if moved by the same influence, the  two Zulu boys leaped up, ran a few yards, and picked up each his \"kiri,\"  a short stick with a knob at the end nearly as big as the fist, ran back  to where the English lads were standing, and with flashing eyes began to  beat the sand with their clubs.    \"Come along, Dick!\" cried Jack.  \"They shan't fight.  You take Sepopo,  I'll take Bechele.  No; don't!  It will make you hot, and you're not  strong.  I'll give it them both.\"    Jack, who was very strong and active for his age, made a dash at the  young Zulus just as they began threatening each other and evidently  meaning to fight, when for a few moments there was a confused struggle,  in which Jack would not have been successful but for his brother's help,  he having overrated his strength.  But Dick joined in, and in spite of  their anger the Zulu boys did not attempt to strike at their young  masters, the result being that they allowed their kiris to be wrenched  from their hands, and the next minute were seated opposite to each other  on the ground.    \"They're as strong as horses, Dick,\" panted Jack.  \"There!  Now, you  sirs, shake hands!\"    \"No!\" shouted one.    \"No!\" shouted the other; and with a make believe of fierceness, Jack  gave each what he called a topper on the head with one of the kiris he  held.    \"Now will you make friends?\" cried Jack; and again they shouted, \"No!\"    \"They won't.  Let them go,\" said Dick, languidly; \"and it makes one so  hot and tired.\"    \"They shan't go till they've made friends,\" said Jack, setting his  teeth; and thrusting his hand into his pocket he brought out a piece of  thick string, the Zulu boys watching him intently.    They remained where Jack had placed them, and going"]]]
