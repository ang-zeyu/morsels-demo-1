We are here, we are there--          We are everywhere;    Swinging on the tree tops, floating in the air;        Hush! Hush! Hush!          Creep into the Bush,    You will find us everywhere.

Oh dear!    They've made a mistake in the day of the year.          Piccaninnies          I.    CHRISTMAS TREE. (_Pohutukawa_).      Long ago the Piccaninnies didn't have a rag to their  backs except a huia feather which they wore in their hair. They were the  jolliest, tubbiest, brownest babies you ever saw with tiny nubbly knobs  on their shoulders, as if they had started to grow wings and then  changed their minds about it, and little furry pointed ears, as all wild  creatures have. Only these were _not_ wild, but very, very shy.    Where did they live? Oh, just anywhere--all about; among the fern, in  the long grass, down on the sands, in all the places babies love to roll  about in.    And then _People_ began to come about, so tiresome! They began to make  houses, sell things in shops, tear about in big boxes on wheels, and  send great, clattering, shrieking, puffing monsters rushing through the  country, dropping smoke and cinders like anything. There was such a  clatter and a chatter, such gabbling and babbling, such hammering and  banging and laughing and crying, and hurry and scurry and rush that it  was enough to drive one crazy. There was such a _fuss_, the Piccaninnies  simply couldn't stand it, and they fled to the Bush. Well, wouldn't you,  with all that going on?    And there they lived a long time. What fun they had swinging on the  giant fern leaves, climbing the trees, chasing the fantails, riding the  kiwis, who are very good-natured, though shy, and teasing the great,  sleepy round-eyed morepork, who is so stupid and _owlish_ in the  daytime.    And then People came _into the Bush!_ Did you ever!    The Piccaninnies took to the trees altogether then, and no wonder!      II.    And then one day some one in a picnic party left a scrap of paper  blowing about--you know the horrid way picnic parties have!--and a  Piccaninny found it.    [Illustration: \"To be sure they were looking at the pictures upside  down, but that made no real difference.\"]    As luck would have it, it was a girl Piccaninny; had it been a boy he  would simply have torn it up and made paper darts with it to throw at  the other boys, and no harm would have been done. _But girls are  different!_    [Illustration: \"Teasing the great, sleepy, round-eyed morepork.\"]    She smoothed it out and looked at it carefully, and then she called the  other girls to look at it. And soon there was such a clattering and  chattering that the boys came racing that way to see if the girls had  found anything good to eat. You know boys!    The scrap of paper was a page out of a fashion book, and there were  pictures on it of horrid little smug-faced boys in sky-blue suits  bowling hoops in a way no real little boy ever bowled a hoop in his  life, and simpering little girls in lace frocks holding dolls or  sun-shades in un-natural attitudes.    But the Piccaninnies were delighted. To be sure they were looking at the  pictures upside down, but that made no real difference.    They decided they must have clothes too.    Of course the boys said pooh they wouldn't! It's much easier to slide  down a fern-leaf, or jump off the end of a branch if you haven't any  clothes--everyone knows that.    But when the girls, after being absent for hours, came back all in  darling little crimson kilts made out of blossoms from the Christmas  tree, the boys simply couldn't bear to think the girls had something  they hadn't got. You know what boys are!    After laughing at the girls in the hopes they'd throw away their pretty  little frocks, the boys went off together. They simply had to think of  something, and it would never do to copy the girls. They came back later  with the quaintest little breeches, made out of broad flax leaves,  stitched together with the points downwards. It was clever of the boys!  They had also stuck some of the red-brown flowers in their hair. The  girls were vexed that they hadn't thought of that, but they went one  better. They made strings of the scarlet nikau berries and hung them  round their necks. (Trust the girls!)    And that was how Fashions came to be started in the Bush.    [Illustration]          CLEMATIS.      Of course fashions change, and no one need be surprised  to find that crimson kilts were soon \"out,\" while the Piccaninny girls  were to be seen walking about in pretty little white, frilly petticoats  made out of clematis blossoms, and sun hats of the same flowers.    The hats were rather silly, because the Piccaninnies lived so deep in  the Bush that the sun couldn't hurt them, but then fashions are absurd.  (Look at the ladies who wear fur coats in hot climates!)    The boys made no change because their kind of fashion doesn't change,  except sometimes you take great pains to iron the crease out of them,  and other times you iron it _in_ most carefull-_ee_.    For some reason the boys didn't like the girls' change of frocks. Of  course, they said, the girls would never play with them now, but the  girls said oh yes, they would. The boys said:    \"You'd be scared to play berry fights like we used to.\"    But the girls said, as brave as could be:    \"Would we?\"    And the boys answered:    \"Let's see you then!\"    So they all ran off and collected puriri berries, big purply red ones,  rather squashy. Then the boys all yelled in chorus:      _Ka mate! Ka mate! Ka ora! Ka ora!    Tenei te tangata puhuru huru    Na na nei i tiki mai--    whaka whiti te ra! Upane! Upane! Upane!    kaupani whiti te ra!_    which means something very warlike, and the girls answered shrilly:      _Ka whawhai tonu! Ake! Ake! Ake!_    They said that because they had heard that someone had said that  sometime about something, and it means \"we will fight for ever and  ever.\"    But they didn't! At the very first volley the berries stained their  dainty frocks, and the girls fled, screaming angrily:    \"You horrid things! You've ruined our frocks!\"    And the boys grinning delightedly, and rolling their black eyes, thumped  their little brown heels on the ground, and beat their little bare,  brown knees and chanted all together:      \"_Akarana Mototapu Rangitoto Ra!_\"    And of course you all know what that means! You don't? Well, I'm not  quite sure myself, because I couldn't find it in the dictionary (so  careless of Mr. Webster!) but it really doesn't matter.    [Illustration]          CABBAGE PALM.    (Pickled Cabbages).      Little Swanki, the Piccaninny girl, and Tiki, the  Piccaninny boy, were up in a karaka tree eating the pulp of the ripe  berries. When I was young I was told I would die if I ate the karaka  berries, but I suppose Piccaninny tummies are different.    Anyhow, there they were, skinning the soft yellow pulp, which _does_  took nice, off the hard inside of the berry with their sharp little  white teeth, and throwing the hard part at a kiwi wandering about below  their tree, and thinking it great fun to watch his surprised face as he  tried to dodge the berries.    Swanki had just eaten her fourteenth berry and was reaching for the  fifteenth, when she sighed discontentedly.    \"Oh, Tiki,\" she said, \"aren't you sick and tired of eating the same old  foods for ever and ever? Berries--berries--berries! Roots--roots--roots!  And only a few leaves that are worth eating.\"    But Tiki was a contented little boy, and he couldn't think of anything  nicer to eat than a handful of ripe puriri berries, or the root of a  young fern.    [Illustration: \"Oh, Tiki, aren't you sick of eating the same old foods  for ever and ever!\"]    \"But what else could we eat?\" he asked, \"There isn't anything else!\"    \"Of course there is--lots and lots,\" answered Swanki. \"There's mince pie  and ham sandwiches and jam tarts and vinegar and plum duff and cakes and  pickled cabbages.\"    [Illustration: \"So they all ran off and collected puriri berries.\"]    Tiki stared at Swanki in amazement; he had never even heard of these  foods, and thought she must be wonderfully clever to know all about  them.    Sly little Swanki did not tell him that she had lately been hidden in a  hollow tree stump near a picnic party which had come into the bush, and  that she had heard the people offering these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#1)"],[1,"scanned by Dianne Bean of Phoenix, Arizona.

The glory of Him who moves everything penetrates through the  universe, and shines in one part more and in another less. In the  heaven that receives most of its light I have been, and have seen  things which he who descends from thereabove neither knows how  nor is able to recount; because, drawing near to its own  desire,[1] our understanding enters so deep, that the memory  cannot follow. Truly whatever of the Holy Realm I could treasure  up in my mind shall now be the theme of my song.    [1] The innate desire of the soul is to attain the vision of  God.      O good Apollo, for this last labor make me such a vessel of thy  power as thou demandest for the gift of the loved laurel.[1] Thus  far one summit of Parnassus has been enough for me, but now with  both[2] I need to enter the remaining, arena. Enter into my  breast, and breathe thou in such wise as when thou drewest  Marsyas from out the sheath of his limbs. O divine Power, if thou  lend thyself to me so that I may make manifest the image of the  Blessed Realm imprinted within my head, thou shalt see me come to  thy chosen tree, and crown myself then with those leaves of which  the theme and thou will make me worthy. So rarely, Father, are  they gathered for triumph or of Caesar or of poet (fault and  shame of the human wills), that the Peneian leaf[3] should bring  forth joy unto the joyous Delphic deity, whenever it makes any  one to long for it. Great flame follows a little spark: perhaps  after me prayer shall be made with better voices, whereto  Cyrrha[4] may respond.    [1] So inspire me in this labor that I may deserve the gift of  the laurel.    [2] The Muses were fabled to dwell on one peak of Parnassus,  Apollo on the other. At the opening of the preceding parts of his  poem Dante has invoked the Muses only.    [3] Daphne, who was changed to the laurel, was the daughter of  Peneus.    [4] Cyrrha, a city sacred to Apollo, not far from the foot of  Parnassus, and here used for the name of the god himself.        The lamp of the world rises to mortals through different  passages, but from that which joins four circles with three  crosses it issues with better course and conjoined with a better  star, and it tempers and seals the mundane wax more after its own  fashion[1] Almost such a passage had made morning there and  evening here;[2] and there all that hemisphere was white, and the  other part black, when I saw Beatrice turned upon the left side,  and looking into the sun: never did eagle so fix himself upon it.  And even as a second ray is wont to issue from the first, and  mount upward again, like a pilgrim who wishes to return; thus of  her action, infused through the eyes into my imagination, mine  was made, and I fixed my eyes upon the sun beyond our use. Much  is allowed there which here is not allowed to our faculties,  thanks to the place made for the human race as its proper,  abode.[3] Not long did I endure it, nor so little that I did not  see it sparkling round about, like iron that issues boiling from  the fire. And on a sudden,[4] day seemed to be added to day, as  if He who is able had adorned  the heaven with another sun.    [1] In the spring the sun rises from a point on the horizon,  where the four great circles, namely, the horizon, the zodiac,  theequator, and the equinoctial colure, meet, and, cutting each  other, form three crosses. The sun is in the sign of Aries, \"a  better star,\" because the influence of this constellation was  supposed to be benignant, and under it the earth reclothes  itself. It was the season assigned to the Creation, and to the  Annunciation.    [2] There, in the Earthly Paradise; here, on earth. It is the  morning of Thursday, April 123. The hours from the mid-day  preceding to this dawn are undescribed.    [3] The Earthly Paradise, made for man in his original  excellence.    [4] So rapid was his ascent to the sphere of fire, drawn upward  by the eyes of Beatrice.      Beatrice was standing with her eyes wholly fixed on the eternal  wheels, and on her I fixed my eyes from thereabove removed.  Looking at her I inwardly became such as Glaucus[1] became on  tasting of the herb which made him consort in the sea of the  other gods. Transhumanizing cannot be signified in words;  therefore let the example[2] suffice for him to whom grace  reserves experience. If I was only what of me thou didst the last  create,[3] O Love that governest the heavens, Thou knowest, who  with Thy light didst lift me. When the revolution which Thou,  being desired, makest eternal,[4] made me attent unto itself with  the harmony which Thou attunest and modulatest, so much of the  heaven then seemed to me enkindled by the flame of the sun, that  rain or river never made so broad a lake.
