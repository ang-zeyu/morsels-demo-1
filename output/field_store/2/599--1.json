The Twin-Verses    1. All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded  on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts  with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of  the ox that draws the carriage.    2. All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded  on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts  with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never  leaves him.    3. \"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,\"--in those  who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.    4. \"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,\"--in those  who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.    5. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by  love, this is an old rule.    6. The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but  those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.    7. He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled,  immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mara (the tempter) will  certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.    8. He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well  controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara will  certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky  mountain.    9. He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed  himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of  the yellow dress.    10. But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all  virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of  the yellow dress.    11. They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never  arrive at truth, but follow vain desires.    12. They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at  truth, and follow true desires.    13. As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break  through an unreflecting mind.    14. As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will  not break through a well-reflecting mind.    15. The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he mourns in the next; he  mourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own  work.    16. The virtuous man delights in this world, and he delights in the  next; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices, when he sees the  purity of his own work.    17. The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he  suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he  suffers more when going on the evil path.    18. The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in the  next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he has  done; he is still more happy when going on the good path.    19. The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion (of the  law), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood, but is  like a cowherd counting the cows of others.    20. The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion  (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness,  possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in  this world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.          Chapter II. On Earnestness    21. Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvana), thoughtlessness  the path of death. Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are  thoughtless are as if dead already.    22. Those who are advanced in earnestness, having understood this  clearly, delight in earnestness, and rejoice in the knowledge of the  Ariyas (the elect).    23. These wise people, meditative, steady, always possessed of strong  powers, attain to Nirvana, the highest happiness.    24. If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is not forgetful,  if his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if he restrains  himself, and lives according to law,--then his glory will increase.    25. By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the  wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.    26. Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps  earnestness as his best jewel.    27. Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust!  He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.    28. When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the  wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the  fools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one that stands on a  mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.    29. Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise  man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.    30. By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the lordship of the  gods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is always blamed.    31. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with  fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his fetters,  small or large.    32. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with  fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he  is close upon Nirvana.          Chapter III. Thought    33. As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes straight  his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard,  difficult to hold back.    34. As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground, our  thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mara (the  tempter).    35. It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and  flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.    36. Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to  perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well  guarded bring happiness.    37. Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone,  is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free  from the bonds of Mara (the tempter).    38. If a man's thoughts are unsteady, if he does not know the true law,  if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be perfect.    39. If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if his mind is not  perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil, then there is no  fear for him while he is watchful.    40. Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this  thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara (the tempter) with  the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should  never rest.    41. Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised,  without understanding, like a useless log.    42. Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to an enemy, a  wrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.    43. Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other relative;  a well-directed mind will do us greater service.      Chapter IV. Flowers    44. Who shall overcome this earth, and the world of Yama (the lord of  the departed), and the world of the gods? Who shall find out the plainly  shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower?    45. The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the  world of the gods. The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of  virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower.    46. He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it  is as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of  Mara, and never see the king of death.    47. Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is  distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.    48. Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is  distracted, before he is satiated in his pleasures.    49. As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower,  or its colour or scent, so let a sage dwell in his village.    50. Not the perversities of others, not their sins of commission or  omission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice  of.    51. Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the  fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.    52. But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are  the fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly.    53. As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many  good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.    54. The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that  of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20181"],[0,"A Defective Santa Claus (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration]              A Defective Santa Claus        [Illustration]        A Defective Santa Claus    JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY    _With Pictures by_    C.

So Uncle pat    An' pet him. (Lee-Bob's ust to that--    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      'Cause he's the _little_-est, you know,    An' allus has b'en humored so!)    Nen Uncle gits the flat-arn out,    An', while he's tellin' us all 'bout      Old Chris'mus-times when _he's_ a kid,    He ist cracked hickernuts, he did,    Till they's a crockful, mighty nigh!    An' when they're all done by an' by,    He raked the red coals out again    An' telled me, \"Fetch that popcorn in,    An' old three-leggud skillut--an'    The _led_ an' all now, little man,--    An' yer old Uncle here 'ull show    You how corn's popped, long years ago    When me an' Santy Claus wuz boys    On Pap's old place in Illinoise!--    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      An' your Pa, too, wuz chums, all through,    With Santy!--Wisht Pa'd be here, too!\"    Nen Uncle sigh at Ma, an' she    Pat him again, an' say to me      An' Etty,--\"You take warning fair!--    Don't talk too much, like Uncle there,    Ner don't fergit, like _him_, my dears,    That 'little pitchers has big ears!'\"    But Uncle say to her, \"Clear out!--    Yer brother knows what he's about.--    _You_ git your Chris'mus-cookin' done    Er these pore childern won't have none!\"    Nen Trip wake up an' raise, an' nen    Turn roun' an' nen lay down again.    An' one time Uncle Sidney say,--    \"When dogs is sleepin' thataway,    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      Like Trip, an' _whimpers_, it's a sign    He'll ketch _eight_ rabbits--mayby _nine_--    Afore his fleas'll wake him--nen    He'll bite hisse'f to sleep again      An _try_ to dream he's go' ketch _ten_.\"    An' when Ma's gone again back in    The kitchen, Uncle scratch his chin    An' say, \"When Santy Claus an' Pa    An' me wuz little boys--an' Ma,    When she's 'bout big as Etty there;--    W'y,--'When we're _growed_--no matter _where_,'    Santy he cross' his heart an' say,--    'I'll come to see you, all, some day    When _you'_ got childerns--all but me    An' pore old Sid!'\" Nen Uncle he    Ist kindo' shade his eyes an' pour'    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      'Bout forty-'leven bushels more    O' popcorn out the skillut there    In Ma's new basket on the chair.
