Four of them appeared a few years back in The State an illustrated  magazine now unhappily defunct; the others, though written about the  same time, have never been published.    And now, time and circumstances have combined to bring the scene in  which they are laid most prominently before the public.    Through the dangerous and difficult barrier of the desert sandbelt that  extends all along the coast, General Botha and his formidable columns  forced their way to Windhuk; from the remote lower reaches of the  Orange River other troops steadily and relentlessly pushed north; and  even to the east the well-nigh unexplored dunes of the southern  Kalahari proved no safeguard to the Germans, for Union forces invaded  them even there: and all eyes in South Africa are to-day turned towards  this new addition to the Union and the Empire.    Whilst imagination has naturally played the chief part in these tales,  the descriptions given of certain parts of this little-known region are  accurate, and by no means overdrawn; at the same time, though they  treat principally of the dangerous and waterless desert, it must be  borne in mind that although the sand dunes form one of Damaraland's  most striking features, yet it is by no means altogether the barren,  scorching dust-heap it is popularly believed to be.    For once the sand region bordering the coast is traversed, and the  higher plateau begins, vegetation and water become more abundant, the  climate is magnificent, and cattle, sheep and goats thrive; whilst in  the north much of which remains practically unexplored there is much  fruitful and well-watered country teeming with game, and akin to  Rhodesia, awaiting the settler.    Mining and stock-raising are the two great possibilities in this new  country, where water conditions are never likely to allow of extensive  agriculture being carried out successfully.    But above all mining! For much of the country and especially the north  is very highly mineralized. Copper abounds; tin and gold have been  found and there can be but little doubt that the former will eventually  be located in abundance and, above all, the diamond fields of the  south-west coastal belt have since their discovery in 1908 added  enormously both to the value of the country and to its attractiveness.    To refer again to these tales; the description of Rip Van Winkle's ride  through the desert, the sand-storm, the huge salt \"pans,\" and indeed  most of the earlier incidents, have been but common-place experiences  of my own in the wastes of the southern Kalahari, slightly altered for  the purposes of the story. Even the \"poison flowers\" exist there and no  Bushman will sleep among them, beautiful as they are. And lest the huge  diamond in the head of the \"Snake\" in the same story be considered an  impossibility, let it be borne in mind that the Cullinan (enormous as  it was) was but the fragment of a monster that must have been every  whit as big as the one I describe. The cataclysm is also a possibility;  for although rain falls but seldom in the desert, there are occasional  thunderstorms of extraordinary violence, and I have seen wide stretches  of the Kalahari near the dry bed of the extinct Molopo River (long  since choked, and part of the desert) converted into a broad deep lake,  after a cloudburst lasting but an hour or so, which drowned hundreds of  head of cattle.    The incident in \"Dick Sydney,\" of the fracas in the bar where the  Germans were toasting to \"The Day,\" was not written after war was  declared, but one night in Luderitzbucht full three years ago, after  hearing that toast drunk publicly in the manner described, and after  witnessing a very similar ending to it! And that particular story was  refused by the then editor of The State, as being too anti-German! Well  times have indeed changed!    And lest a prospective \"Dick Sydney\" should think that the picture of  that individual picking up a thousand carats of diamonds in an hour or  so is far-fetched, let me assure him that the first discoverers of the  Pomona fields, south of Luderitzbucht, did literally fill their pockets  with the precious stones in that space of time: and that other fields  as rich may well await discovery will be denied by few who know the  country.    \"Ex Africa semper aliquid novo\" never was saying truer! and Damaraland,  under the British flag, and with scope given to individual enterprise,  may well provide still another striking example of that old adage.    FREDERICK C. CORNELL.    Cape Town, 1915.        A RIP VAN WINKLE OF THE KALAHARI         INTRODUCTORY        The manner of my meeting with him was strange in the extreme, and a  fitting prelude to the wild and fantastic story he told me.    I had been trading and elephant shooting in Portuguese territory in  Southern Angola; and hearing from my boys that ivory was plentiful in  German territory, farther south, I had crossed the Kunene River into  Amboland; and here, sure enough, I found elephants and ivory galore. So  good, indeed, was both sport and trade in this country of the Ovampos  that by the time I reached Etosha Pau my \"trade\" goods had vanished,  and my wagon was heavily laden with fine tusks. So far had I penetrated  into German territory that I decided to make my way south-west towards  Walfisch Bay instead of returning to Portuguese territory. But I knew I  must rest my cattle well before attempting it, for it would mean an  arduous trek; I had no guide, and there were no roads; for at the time  I speak of, the Germans had done but little to open up the northern  part of their territory; and indeed even to the present day much of it  still remains unexplored.    It is a wild and beautiful country, for the greater part well-wooded,  and teeming with game; though towards the east it becomes drier and  sandier until there stretches before the traveler nothing but the  endless dunes of the unknown Kalahari desert.    Untraversed, unexplored, and mysterious, this land of \"The Great  Thirst\" had always held a great fascination for me; its outlying dunes  began but a few miles east of my camp, and from an isolated granite  kopje near their border I had often gazed across the apparently  limitless sea of sand: stretching as far as the eye could reach to  where the dancing shimmer of the mirage linked sand and sky on the far  horizon.    It was along the edge of these dunes that I one day followed a wounded  eland so far that dusk overtook me a long distance from my wagon. My  water-bottle was full, there was abundance of dry wood for a fire, and  I was just debating whether I would try and get back to the wagon, or  camp where I was, when my horse solved the question for me by shying  violently at something, and throwing me clean out of the saddle.    My head must have struck a stone, for I was stunned, and for a time I  knew no more.    When I came to myself it was dark, but a bright fire was burning near  me, a blanket covered me, and I was lying upon something soft.  Evidently some one was caring for me, and I concluded that my boys had  found me though I had given them strict instructions not to leave the  wagon.    \"Jantje! Kambala!\" I called, but there was no answer, and I tried to  rise. But my hurt had apparently been a severe one, for my head spun  round, the fire danced before my eyes, and I again lost consciousness.    When next I awoke the fire was still burning, and a figure was seated  beside it: a figure that the leaping flames rendered monstrous and  distorted. The back was towards me, but at the slight rustle I made  upon my bed of dry leaves in awakening, the figure turned in my  direction, and I caught a momentary glimpse of the face. Firelight  plays strange tricks sometimes, but the momentary flicker showed me a  countenance so grotesque that I must have made an involuntary movement  of surprise, for with a short laugh the unknown man rose and came  towards me, saying as he did so, \"Don't be scared even the devil isn't  as black as he's painted!\" And, whoever he was, the way in which he  tended to my throbbing head, advising me not to talk, but to rest and  sleep, soon soothed my shaken nerves, and I slept again till broad  daylight.    I could hear the low murmur of voices, and sitting up, I saw that  Jantje and Kambala had put in an appearance and were talking in an  unknown tongue to my friend of the night before--a white man--but  surely the strangest-looking being I had ever beheld.    First of all he was a hunchback, and his body was twisted and distorted  to a remarkable degree yet in spite of his curved shoulders he was of  more than average height, and of a breadth incredible.

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1861,  BY STEPHEN L. GOODALE,  In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Maine.        Press of Stevens & Sayward,  Augusta, Maine.          PREFACE.      The writer has had frequent occasion to notice the want of some handy  book embodying the principles necessary to be understood in order to  secure improvement in Domestic Animals.    It has been his aim to supply this want.    In doing so he has availed himself freely of the knowledge supplied by  others, the aim being to furnish a useful, rather than an original  book.    If it serve in any measure to supply the need, and to awaken greater  interest upon a matter of vital importance to the agricultural  interests of the country, the writer's purpose will be accomplished.

CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTORY.      The object of the husbandman, like that of men engaged in other  avocations, is _profit_; and like other men the farmer may expect  success proportionate to the skill, care, judgment and perseverance  with which his operations are conducted.    The better policy of farmers generally, is to make stock husbandry in  some one or more of its departments a leading aim--that is to say,  while they shape their operations according to the circumstances in  which they are situated, these should steadily embrace the conversion  of a large proportion of the crops grown into animal products,--and  this because, by so doing, they may not only secure a present  livelihood, but best maintain and increase the fertility of their  lands.    The object of the stock grower is to obtain the most valuable returns  from his vegetable products. He needs, as Bakewell happily expressed  it, \"the best _machine_ for converting herbage and other animal food  into money.\"    He will therefore do well to seek such animals as are most perfect of  their kind--such as will pay best for the expense of procuring the  machinery, for the care and attention bestowed, and for the  consumption of raw material. The returns come in various forms. They  may or may not be connected with the ultimate value of the animal. In  the beef ox and the mutton sheep, they are so connected to a large  extent; in the dairy cow and the fine wooled sheep, this is quite a  secondary consideration;--in the horse, valued as he is for beauty,  speed and draught, it is not thought of at all.    Not only is there a wide range of field for operations, from which the  stock grower may select his own path of procedure, but there is a  demand that his attention be directed _with a definite aim_, and  _towards an end clearly apprehended_. The first question to be  answered, is, what do we want? and the next, how shall we get it?    What we want, depends wholly upon our situation and surroundings, and  each must answer it for himself. In England the problem to be solved  by the breeder of neat cattle and sheep is how \"to produce an animal  or a living machine which with a certain quantity and quality of food,  and under certain given circumstances, shall yield in the shortest  time the largest quantity and best quality of beef, mutton or milk,  with the largest profit to the producer and at least cost to the  consumer.\" But this is not precisely the problem for American farmers  to solve, because our circumstances are different. Few, if any, here  grow oxen for beef alone, but for labor and beef, so that earliest  possible maturity may be omitted and a year or more of labor  profitably intervene before conversion to beef. Many cultivators of  sheep, too, are so situated as to prefer fine wool, which is  incompatible with the largest quantity and best quality of meat.  Others differently situated in regard to a meat market would do well  to follow the English practice and aim at the most profitable  production of mutton. A great many farmers, not only of those in the  vicinity of large towns, but of those at some distance, might, beyond  doubt, cultivate dairy qualities in cows, to great advantage, and this  too, even, if necessary, at the sacrifice, to considerable extent, of  beef making qualities. As a general thing dairy qualities have been  sadly neglected in years past.    Whatever may be the object in view, it should be clearly apprehended,  and striven for with persistent and well directed efforts. To buy or  breed common animals of mixed qualities and use them for any and for  all purposes is too much like a manufacturer of cloth procuring some  carding, spinning and weaving machinery, adapted to no particular  purpose but which can somehow be used for any, and attempting to make  fabrics of cotton, of wool, and of linen with it. I do not say that  cloth would not be produced, but he would assuredly be slow in getting  rich by it.    The stock grower needs not only to have a clear and definite aim in  view, but also to understand the means by which it may best be  accomplished. Among these means a knowledge of the principles of  breeding holds a prominent place, and this is not of very easy  acquisition by the mass of farmers. The experience of any one man  would go but a little way towards acquiring it, and there has not been  much published on the subject in any form within the reach of most. I  have been able to find nothing like an extended systematic treatise on  the subject, either among our own or the foreign agricultural  literature which has come within my notice. Indeed, from the  scantiness of what appears to have been written, coupled with the fact  that much knowledge must exist somewhere, one is tempted to believe  that not all which might have done so, has yet found its way to  printers' ink. That a great deal has been acquired, we know, as we  know a tree--by its fruits. That immense achievements have been  accomplished is beyond doubt.    The improvement of the domestic animals of a country so as greatly to  enhance their individual and aggregate value, and to render the  rearing of them more profitable to all concerned, is surely one of the  achievements of advanced civilization and enlightenment, and is as  much a triumph of science and skill as the construction of a railroad,  a steamship, an electric telegraph, or any work of architecture. If  any doubt this, let them ponder the history of those breeds of animals  which have made England the stock nursery of the world, the perfection  of which enables her to export thousands of animals at prices almost  fabulously beyond their value for any purpose but to propagate their  kind; let them note the patient industry, the genius and application  which have been put forth to bring them to the condition they have  attained, and their doubts must cease.    Robert Bakewell of Dishley, was one of the first of these improvers.  Let us stop for a moment's glance at him. Born in 1725, on the farm  where his father and grandfather had been tenants, he began at the age  of thirty to carry out the plans for the improvement of domestic  animals upon which he had resolved as the result of long and patient  study and reflection. He was a man of genius, energy and perseverance.  With sagacity to conceive and fortitude to perfect his designs, he  laid his plans and struggled against many disappointments, amid the  ridicule and predictions of failure freely bestowed by his  neighbors,--often against serious pecuniary embarrassments; and at  last was crowned by a wonderful degree of success. When he commenced  letting his rams, (a system first introduced by him and adhered to  during his life, in place of selling,) they brought him 17_s._ 6_d._  each, for the season.
