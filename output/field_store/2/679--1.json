To          F.L.S.       A MAN OF LAW      First Printed, May, 1922    32nd Edition, September, 1934    Made and Printed in Great Britain for Hodder and Stoughton Limited,  by Wyman & Sons Ltd., London, Reading and Fakenham          The Angel of Terror          Chapter I      The hush of the court, which had been broken when the foreman of the  jury returned their verdict, was intensified as the Judge, with a quick  glance over his pince-nez at the tall prisoner, marshalled his papers  with the precision and method which old men display in tense moments  such as these. He gathered them together, white paper and blue and buff  and stacked them in a neat heap on a tiny ledge to the left of his desk.  Then he took his pen and wrote a few words on a printed paper before  him.    Another breathless pause and he groped beneath the desk and brought out  a small square of black silk and carefully laid it over his white wig.  Then he spoke:    \"James Meredith, you have been convicted after a long and patient trial  of the awful crime of wilful murder. With the verdict of the jury I am  in complete agreement. There is little doubt, after hearing the evidence  of the unfortunate lady to whom you were engaged, and whose evidence you  attempted in the most brutal manner to refute, that, instigated by your  jealousy, you shot Ferdinand Bulford. The evidence of Miss Briggerland  that you had threatened this poor young man, and that you left her  presence in a temper, is unshaken. By a terrible coincidence, Mr.  Bulford was in the street outside your fiancee's door when you left, and  maddened by your insane jealousy, you shot him dead.    \"To suggest, as you have through your counsel, that you called at Miss  Briggerland's that night to break off your engagement and that the  interview was a mild one and unattended by recriminations is to suggest  that this lady has deliberately committed perjury in order to swear away  your life, and when to that disgraceful charge you produce a motive,  namely that by your death or imprisonment Miss Briggerland, who is your  cousin, would benefit to a considerable extent, you merely add to your  infamy. Nobody who saw the young girl in the box, a pathetic, and if I  may say, a beautiful figure, could accept for one moment your fantastic  explanation.    \"Who killed Ferdinand Bulford? A man without an enemy in the world. That  tragedy cannot be explained away. It now only remains for me to pass the  sentence which the law imposes. The jury's recommendation to mercy will  be forwarded to the proper quarter....\"    He then proceeded to pass sentence of death, and the tall man in the  dock listened without a muscle of his face moving.    So ended the great Berkeley Street Murder Trial, and when a few days  later it was announced that the sentence of death had been commuted to  one of penal servitude for life, there were newspapers and people who  hinted at mistaken leniency and suggested that James Meredith would have  been hanged if he were a poor man instead of being, as he was, the  master of vast wealth.    \"That's that,\" said Jack Glover between his teeth, as he came out of  court with the eminent King's Counsel who had defended his friend and  client, \"the little lady wins.\"    His companion looked sideways at him and smiled.    \"Honestly, Glover, do you believe that poor girl could do so dastardly a  thing as lie about the man she loves?\"    \"She loves!\" repeated Jack Glover witheringly.    \"I think you are prejudiced,\" said the counsel, shaking his head.  \"Personally, I believe that Meredith is a lunatic; I am satisfied that  all he told us about the interview he had with the girl was born of a  diseased imagination. I was terribly impressed when I saw Jean  Briggerland in the box. She--by Jove, there is the lady!\"    They had reached the entrance of the Court. A big car was standing by  the kerb and one of the attendants was holding open the door for a girl  dressed in black. They had a glimpse of a pale, sad face of  extraordinary beauty, and then she disappeared behind the drawn blinds.    The counsel drew a long sigh.    \"Mad!\" he said huskily. \"He must be mad! If ever I saw a pure soul in a  woman's face, it is in hers!\"    \"You've been in the sun, Sir John--you're getting sentimental,\" said  Jack Glover brutally, and the eminent lawyer choked indignantly.    Jack Glover had a trick of saying rude things to his friends, even when  those friends were twenty years his senior, and by every rule of  professional etiquette entitled to respectful treatment.    \"Really!\" said the outraged Sir John. \"There are times, Glover, when you  are insufferable!\"    But by this time Jack Glover was swinging along the Old Bailey, his  hands in his pockets, his silk hat on the back of his head.    He found the grey-haired senior member of the firm of Rennett, Glover  and Simpson (there had been no Simpson in the firm for ten years) on the  point of going home.    Mr. Rennett sat down at the sight of his junior.    \"I heard the news by 'phone,\" he said. \"Ellbery says there is no ground  for appeal, but I think the recommendation to mercy will save his  life--besides it is a _crime passionelle_, and they don't hang for  homicidal jealousy. I suppose it was the girl's evidence that turned the  trick?\"    Jack nodded.    \"And she looked like an angel just out of the refrigerator,\" he said  despairingly. \"Ellbery did his poor best to shake her, but the old fool  is half in love with her--I left him raving about her pure soul and her  other celestial etceteras.\"    Mr. Rennett stroked his iron grey beard.    \"She's won,\" he said, but the other turned on him with a snarl.    \"Not yet!\" he said almost harshly. \"She hasn't won till Jimmy Meredith  is dead or----\"    \"Or----?\" repeated his partner significantly. \"That 'or' won't come off,  Jack. He'll get a life sentence as sure as 'eggs is eggs.' I'd go a long  way to help Jimmy; I'd risk my practice and my name.\"    Jack Glover looked at his partner in astonishment.    \"You old sportsman!\" he said admiringly. \"I didn't know you were so fond  of Jimmy?\"    Mr. Rennett got up and began pulling on his gloves. He seemed a little  uncomfortable at the sensation he had created.    \"His father was my first client,\" he said apologetically. \"One of the  best fellows that ever lived. He married late in life, that was why he  was such a crank over the question of marriage. You might say that old  Meredith founded our firm. Your father and Simpson and I were nearly at  our last gasp when Meredith gave us his business. That was our turning  point. Your father--God rest him--was never tired of talking about it. I  wonder he never told you.\"    \"I think he did,\" said Jack thoughtfully. \"And you really would go a  long way--Rennett--I mean, to help Jim Meredith?\"    \"All the way,\" said old Rennett shortly.    Jack Glover began whistling a long lugubrious tune.    \"I'm seeing the old boy to-morrow,\" he said. \"By the way, Rennett, did  you see that a fellow had been released from prison to a nursing home  for a minor operation the other day? There was a question asked in  Parliament about it. Is it usual?\"    \"It can be arranged,\" said Rennett. \"Why?\"    \"Do you think in a few months' time we could get Jim Meredith into a  nursing home for--say an appendix operation?\"    \"Has he appendicitis?\" asked the other in surprise.    \"He can fake it,\" said Jack calmly. \"It's the easiest thing in the world  to fake.\"    Rennett looked at the other under his heavy eyebrows.    \"You're thinking of the 'or'?\" he challenged, and Jack nodded.    \"It can be done--if he's alive,\" said Rennett after a pause.    \"He'll be alive,\" prophesied his partner, \"now the only thing is--where  shall I find the girl?\"          Chapter II      Lydia Beale gathered up the scraps of paper that littered her table,  rolled them into a ball and tossed them into the fire.    There was a knock at the door, and she half turned in her chair to meet  with a smile her stout landlady who came in carrying a tray on which  stood a large cup of tea and two thick and wholesome slices of bread and  jam.    \"Finished, Miss Beale?\" asked the landlady anxiously.    \"For the day, yes,\" said the girl with a nod, and stood up stretching  herself stiffly.    She was slender, a head taller than the dumpy Mrs. Morgan. The dark  violet eyes and the delicate spiritual face she owed to her Celtic  ancestors, the grace of her movements, no less than the perfect hands  that rested on the drawing board, spoke eloquently of breed.    \"I'd like to see it, miss, if I may,\" said Mrs. Morgan, wiping her hands  on her apron in anticipation.    Lydia pulled open a drawer of the table and took out a large sheet of  Windsor board. She had completed her pencil sketch and Mrs. Morgan  gasped appreciatively. It was a picture of a masked man holding a  villainous crowd at bay at the point of a pistol.    \"That's wonderful, miss,\" she said in awe. \"I suppose those sort of  things happen too?\"    The girl laughed as she put the drawing away.    \"They happen in stories which I illustrate, Mrs. Morgan,\" she said  dryly. \"The real brigands of life come in the shape of lawyers' clerks  with writs and summonses. It's a relief from those mad fashion plates I  draw, anyway. Do you know, Mrs. Morgan, that the sight of a dressmaker's  shop window makes me positively ill!\"    Mrs. Morgan shook her head sympathetically and Lydia changed the  subject.    \"Has anybody been this afternoon?\" she asked.    \"Only the young man from Spadd & Newton,\" replied the stout woman with a  sigh. \"I told 'im you was out, but I'm a bad liar.\"    The girl groaned.    \"I wonder if I shall ever get to the end of those debts,\" she said in  despair. \"I've enough writs in the drawer to paper the house, Mrs.  Morgan.\"    Three years ago Lydia Beale's"]]]
