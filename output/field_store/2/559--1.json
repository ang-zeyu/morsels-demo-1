It will also  be of great value to those who are undergoing training.    It is full of practical information presented in a simple and direct  manner and gives in detail much data not easily found elsewhere. It is a  useful book, easily understandable by those who have had little or no  military experience.    It will be useful not only at training camps but it will be of very  great value at schools and colleges where military instruction is being  given.    The authors of this book have performed a valuable service, one which  will tend to facilitate and aid very much the development of military  training in this country. In addition to the purely mechanical details  of training the book presents in a very effective and simple manner the  tactical use of troops under various conditions.    In a word it is a useful and sound work and one which can be commended  to those who contemplate a course in military training.    (Signed) Leonard Wood,  Major General U. S. A.    February 27, 1917.          PREFACE      This book is intended to serve as a foundation upon which the military  beginner may build so that he may in time be able to study the technical  service manuals intelligently. It has been written as an elementary  textbook for those who desire to become Reserve Officers, for schools  and colleges, and for those who may be called to the colors.    The authors have commanded companies at Plattsburg, New York, and,  noting the need of such a text, compiled their observations while there.    The average man undergoing military training wants to know as much as  possible about the art and science of war. He wants to acquire a good  knowledge of the principles involved. He is interested in the technique  of movements. He is willing to work for these things, but he often  becomes lost in confusion when he attempts to study the technical  service manuals. He does not know how to select the most important and  omit the less important. The authors have selected from the standard  texts some of the vitally important subjects and principles and have  presented them to the civilian in a simple and plain way.    The first part of the text is for the beginner. It tells him how to  prepare physically for strenuous military work. After assisting him  through the elementary part of his instruction, it presents for his  consideration and study the Officers' Reserve Corps.    The second part, or supplement, is a more technical discussion of those  subjects introduced in the first. It is intended principally for those  who have made excellent progress.

The departments and  their headquarters are as follows:         (1) The Northeastern Department, with headquarters at Boston,           Massachusetts.         (2) The Eastern Department, with headquarters at Governors Island,           New York.         (3) The Southeastern Department, with Headquarters at Charleston,           South Carolina.         (4) The Central Department, with Headquarters at Chicago, Illinois.         (5) The Southern Department, with Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston,           Texas.         (6) The Western Department, with Headquarters at San Francisco,           California.         Overseas    { (7) The Philippine Department, with Headquarters at       Departments {     Manila.                   {                   { (8) The Hawaiian Department, Departments with                   {     Headquarters at Honolulu, Hawaii.    (For States comprising each department, see Appendix)    If you are a civilian and desire any information in regard to the army,  any training camps, the officers' reserve corps, or any military  legislation or orders affecting you, write to the \"Commanding General\"  of the Department in which you live. Address your letter to him at his  headquarters.        MAIL      Mail is most often delayed because there is not sufficient information  for the Postmaster on the envelope. The delivery of your mail will be  delayed unless your letters are sent to the company and the regiment to  which you belong. Therefore, prepare, before you reach camp, several  stamped postal cards, addressed to your family and business associates,  containing directions to address all communications to you care of  Company----, Regiment----. As soon as you are assigned to a company and  regiment, fill in these data and mail these postal cards at once. This  should be done by wire in case important mail is expected during the  first week of camp. Mail is delivered to each company as soon as a  complete roll of the organizations can be made out and sent to the  post-office.        INOCULATIONS AND VACCINATION      As soon as you become a member of the army, whether as a private or as  an officer, you will receive the typhoid prophylaxis inoculation and be  vaccinated against smallpox.        WHAT TO BRING          1. Travel light. Bring only the bare necessities of life with you.      Don't bring a trunk. Enlisted men (not officers) will be supplied      with all necessary uniforms and underwear. This includes shoes.        2. Bring a pair of sneakers, or slippers. They will add greatly to      your comfort after a long march or hard day's work. A complete      bathing suit often comes in handy.        3. Report in uniform if you have one.        4. The Government will provide you with the necessary shoes.      However, if you can afford it, buy before you report for duty, a      pair of regulation tan shoes, larger than you ordinarily wear, and      break them in well before arrival. Rubber heels are recommended.        5. Bring your toilet articles (comb, brush, mirror shaving      equipment, etc.), and a good supply of handkerchiefs, and towels.        WHAT TO DO ON YOUR ARRIVAL      There is a general rule of procedure to follow in reporting for duty at  any post or training camp.        1. If you receive an order directing you to report for duty at a      camp or post at a certain specified time, read it carefully, put it      in a secure place, and, on the day that you are to report for duty      at the camp or post, present yourself in uniform, if you have one,      with your order. Be careful not to lose your order or leave it at      home. Have it in your pocket book.        2. Upon being assigned to a company, unless you receive orders to      the contrary, report at once with your baggage to your company      commander (captain), whom you can easily find when you reach your      barracks or company street. If you cannot locate your company      commander, report to the first sergeant.        3. It is a custom of the service to have an experienced soldier      explain to a new man exactly where he is to go and what he is to do.      Feel no embarrassment at being ignorant of your new duties and      surroundings. The Government does not expect anything of you except      eagerness to learn and willingness to obey.        4. After reporting to your company commander or first sergeant, you      will have a bed assigned to you and you will be issued the property      and uniforms necessary to your comfort and duties. Check your      property carefully as it is issued to you. You will have to sign for      all of it. Look after your property at all times.        5. After checking your property, make up your bed and arrange neatly      your personal and issued property on or under your bed or cot.        6.

PREFACE      The science of eugenics consists of a foundation of biology and a  superstructure of sociology. Galton, its founder, emphasized both parts  in due proportion. Until recently, however, most sociologists have been  either indifferent or hostile to eugenics, and the science has been left  for the most part in the hands of biologists, who have naturally worked  most on the foundations and neglected the superstructure. Although we  are not disposed to minimize the importance of the biological part, we  think it desirable that the means of applying the biological principles  should be more carefully studied. The reader of this book will,  consequently, find only a summary explanation of the mechanism of  inheritance. Emphasis has rather been laid on the practical means by  which society may encourage the reproduction of superior persons and  discourage that of inferiors.    We assume that in general, a eugenically superior or desirable person  has, to a greater degree than the average, the germinal basis for the  following characteristics: to live past maturity, to reproduce  adequately, to live happily and to make contributions to the  productivity, happiness, and progress of society. It is desirable to  discriminate as much as possible between the possession of the germinal  basis and the observed achievement, since the latter consists of the  former plus or minus environmental influence. But where the amount of  modification is too obscure to be detected, it is advantageous to take  the demonstrated achievement as a tentative measure of the germinal  basis. The problem of eugenics is to make such legal, social and  economic adjustments that (1) a larger proportion of superior persons  will have children than at present, (2) that the average number of  offspring of each superior person will be greater than at present, (3)  that the most inferior persons will have no children, and finally that  (4) other inferior persons will have fewer children than now. The  science of eugenics is still young and much of its program must be  tentative and subject to the test of actual experiment. It is more  important that the student acquire the habit of looking at society from  a biological as well as a sociological point of view, than that he put  his faith in the efficacy of any particular mode of procedure.    The essential points of our eugenics program were laid down by Professor  Johnson in an article entitled \"Human Evolution and its Control\" in the  _Popular Science Monthly_ for January, 1910. Considerable parts of the  material in the present book have appeared in the _Journal of Heredity_.  Helpful suggestions and criticism have been received from several  friends, in particular Sewall Wright and O. E. Baker of the United States  Department of Agriculture.                                                           PAUL POPENOE.
