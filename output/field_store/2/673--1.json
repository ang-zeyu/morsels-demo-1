One day some money is missing from the office. It's pretty obvious who  the thief is, but Uncle Josiah continues to accuse Don.  Another worker  has a row with his new young wife, and Don and he (Jem) decide to go  away for a bit, both feeling rather ill-used.  Unfortunately they are  taken that night by the press-gang, and after some attempts to get away,  they sail away to New Zealand.  Here they manage to escape from the  ship, though the search for them is keen.  They fall in with some  Maoris, among whom lives an Englishman, who is actually an escaped  convict, but a good chap nonetheless.  They assist the Maoris in their  own battles against other tribes.    The scene turns to some English settlers.  They become friendly with our  heroes.  A Maori tribe attacks then, having been set up to do so by  three villains, who have also escaped from the convict settlement at  Norfolk Island.  They hold their own, but there is a timely intervention  by the police.  One of the three villains turn out to have been the man  who actually stole the money from Uncle Josiah's office. From this point  things begin to turn out for the better, and the two heroes return to  England, and all is forgiven.  NH    ________________________________________________________________________    THE ADVENTURES OF DON LAVINGTON, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.        CHAPTER ONE.    FOUR FOLK O' BRISTOL CITY.    \"Mind your head!  Crikey!  That was near, 'nother inch, and you'd ha'  crushed him like an eggshell.\"    \"Well, you told me to lower down.\"    \"No, I didn't, stupid.\"    \"Yes, you did.\"    \"No, I didn't.  You're half tipsy, or half asleep, or--\"    \"There, there, hold your tongue, Jem.  I'm not hurt, and Mike thought  you said lower away.  That's enough.\"    \"No, it arn't enough, Mas' Don.  Your uncle said I was to soop'rintend,  and a nice row there'd ha' been when he come back if you hadn't had any  head left.\"    \"Wouldn't have mattered much, Jem.  Nobody would have cared.\"    \"Nobody would ha' cared?  Come, I like that.  What would your mother ha'  said to me when I carried you home, and told her your head had been  scrunched off by a sugar-cask?\"    \"You're right, Mas' Don.  Nobody wouldn't ha' cared.  You aren't wanted  here.  Why don't you strike for liberty, my lad, and go and make your  fortun' in furren parts?\"    \"Same as you have, Mike Bannock?  Now just you look ye here.  If ever I  hears you trying to make Master Don unsettled again, and setting him  agen his work, I tells Mr Chris'mas, and no begging won't get you back  on again.  Fortun' indeed!  Why, you ragged, penny-hunting, lazy,  drunken rub-shoulder, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!\"    \"And I arn't a bit, Jem Wimble, not a bit.  Never you mind him, Master  Don, you strike for freedom.  Make your uncle give you your father's  money, and then off you goes like a man to see life.\"    \"Now lookye here,\" cried the sturdy, broad-faced young fellow who had  first spoken, as he picked up a wooden lever used for turning over the  great sugar-hogsheads lying in the yard, and hoisting them into a  trolly, or beneath the crane which raised them into the warehouse.  \"Lookye here, Mike Bannock, I never did knock a man down with this here  wooden bar, but if you gets stirring Mas' Don again, has it you do,  right across the back.  Spang!\"    \"Be quiet, Jem, and put the bar down,\" said Lindon Lavington, a dark,  well set-up lad of seventeen, as he sat upon the head of a  sugar-hogshead with his arms folded, slowly swinging his legs.    \"No, I sha'n't put the bar down, Mas' Don.  Your uncle left me in charge  of the yard, and--what yer sitting on the sugar-barrel for when there's  a 'bacco hogshead close by?  Now just you feel how sticky you are.\"    Don got off the barrel, and made a face, as he proved with one hand the  truth of the man's words, and then rubbed his treacly fingers against  the warehouse wall.    \"Your mother'll make a row about that, just as my Sally does when I get  molasses on my clothes.\"    \"You should teach her to lick it off, Jemmy Wimble,\" said the  rough-looking, red-faced labourer, who had lowered down a sugar-hogshead  so rapidly, that he had been within an inch of making it unnecessary to  write Don Lavington's life, from the fact of there being no life to  write.    \"You mind your own business, Mike,\" said Jem, indignantly.    \"That's what I'm a-doing of, and a-waiting for orders, Mr Jem Wimble.  He's hen-pecked, Mas' Don, that what's the matter with him.  Been  married only three months, and he's hen-pecked.  Haw-haw-haw!  Poor old  cock-bird!  Hen-pecked!  Haw-haw-haw!\"    Jem Wimble, general worker in the warehouse and yard of Josiah  Christmas, West India merchant, of River Street, Bristol, gave Mike the  labourer an angry look, as he turned as red as a blushing girl.    \"Lookye here,\" he cried angrily, as Don, who had reseated himself, this  time on a hogshead crammed full of compressed tobacco-leaves from  Baltimore, swung his legs, and looked on in a half-moody, half-amused  way; \"the best thing that could happen for Christmas' Ward and for  Bristol City, would be for the press-gang to get hold o' you, and take  you off to sea.\"    \"Haw-haw-haw!\" laughed the swarthy, red-faced fellow.  \"Why don't you  give 'em the word, and have me pressed?\"    \"No coming back to be begged on then by Miss Kitty and Mas' Don, after  being drunk for a week.  You're a bad 'un, that's what you are, Mike  Bannock, and I wish the master wouldn't have you here.\"    \"Not such a hard nut as you are, Jemmy,\" said the man with a chuckle.  \"Sailors won't take me--don't want cripples to go aloft.  Lookye here,  Mas' Don, there's a leg.\"    As he spoke, the great idle-looking fellow limped slowly, with an  exaggerated display of lameness, to and fro past the door of the office.    \"Get out, Mike,\" said Don, as the man stopped.  \"I believe that's nearly  all sham.\"    \"That's a true word, Mas' Don,\" cried Jem.  \"He's only lame when he  thinks about it.  And now do please go on totting up, and let's get  these casks shifted 'fore your uncle comes back.\"    \"Well, I'm waiting, Jem,\" cried the lad, opening a book he had under his  arm, and in which a pencil was shut.  \"I could put down fifty, while you  are moving one.\"    \"That's all right, sir; that's all right.  I only want to keep things  straight, and not have your uncle rowing you when he comes back.  Seems  to me as life's getting to be one jolly row.  What with my Sally at  home, and your uncle here, and you always down in the mouth, and Mike  not sticking to his work, things is as miserable as mizzar.\"    \"He's hen-pecked, that's what he is,\" chuckled Mike, going to the handle  of the crane.  \"Poor old Jemmy!  Hen-pecked, that's what's the matter  with him.\"    \"Let him alone, Mike,\" said Don quietly.    \"Right, Mas' Don,\" said the man; \"but if I was you,\" he murmured  hoarsely, as Jem went into the warehouse, \"I'd strike for liberty.  I  knows all about it.  When your mother come to live with your uncle she  give him all your father's money, and he put it into the business.  I  know.  I used to work here when you first come, only a little un, and a  nice little un you was, just after your poor father died.\"    Don's brow wrinkled as he looked searchingly at the man.    \"You've a right to half there is here, Mas' Don; but the old man's  grabbing of it all for his gal, Miss Kitty, and has made your mother and  you reg'lar servants.\"    \"It is not true, Mike.  My uncle has behaved very kindly to my mother  and me.  He has invested my money, and given me a home when I was left  an orphan.\"    \"_Kick_!\"    That is the nearest approach to the sound of Mike's derisive laugh, one  which made the lad frown and dart at him an angry look.    \"Why, who told you that, my lad?\"    \"My mother, over and over again.\"    \"Ah, poor thing, for the sake o' peace and quietness.  Don't you believe  it, my lad.  You've been werry kind to me, and begged me on again here  when I've been 'most starving, and many's the shillin' you've give me,  Mas' Don, to buy comforts, or I wouldn't say to you what I does now, and  werry welcome a shilling would be to-day, Mas' Don.\"    \"I haven't any money, Mike.\"    \"Got no money, my lad?  What a shame, when half of all this here ought  to be yourn.  Oh dear, what a cruel thing it seems!  I'm very sorry for  you, Mas' Don, that I am, 'specially when I think of what a fine dashing  young fellow like--\"    \"Don't humbug, Mike.\"    \"Nay, not I, my lad; 'tarn't likely.  You know it's true enough.  You're  one of the young fellows as is kep' out of his rights.  I know what I'd  do if I was you.\"    \"What?\"    \"Not be always rubbing my nose again a desk.  Go off to one o' them  bu'ful foreign countries as I've told you of, where there's gold and  silver and dymons, and birds jus' like 'em; and wild beasts to kill, and  snakes as long as the main mast.  Ah!  I've seen some sights in furren  abroad, as what I've told you about's like nothing to 'em.  Look here,  Mas' Don, shall I stop on for an hour and tell you what I've seen in  South America?\"    \"No, no, Mike; my uncle doesn't like you to be with me.\"    \"Ah, and well I knows it.  'Cause I tells you the truth and he feels  guilty, Mas' Don.\"    \"And--and it only unsettles me,\" cried the boy with a despairing look in  his eyes.  \"Get on with your work, and I must get on with mine.\"    \"Ah, to be sure,\" said the scoundrel with a sneer.  \"Work, work, work.  You and me, Mas' Don, is treated worse than the black niggers as cuts  the sugar-canes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21322"],[0,"The Tale of Betsy Butterfly (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net                    [Illustration: Betsy Held the Skipper by His Coat-tails.  _Frontispiece_ (_Page_ 113)]      _TUCK-ME-IN TALES_  (Trademark Registered)    THE TALE OF BETSY BUTTERFLY    BY ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY    [Illustration]    NEW YORK  GROSSET & DUNLAP  PUBLISHERS    Made in the United States of America    Copyright, 1918, by  GROSSET & DUNLAP          CONTENTS      CHAPTER                               PAGE         I.

THE SKIPPER                    110          THE TALE OF BETSY BUTTERFLY    I    BEAUTY AND THE BLOSSOMS      EVERY one of the field people in Pleasant Valley, and the forest folk as  well, was different from his neighbors. For instance, there was Jasper  Jay. He was the noisiest chap for miles around. And there was Peter  Mink. Without doubt he was the rudest and most rascally fellow in the  whole district. Then there was Freddie Firefly, who was the brightest  youngster on the farm--at least after dark, when his light flashed  across the meadow.    So it went. One person was wiser than any of his neighbors; another was  stupider; and somebody else was always hungrier. But there was one who  was the loveliest. Not only was she beautiful to look upon. She was  graceful in flight as well. When one saw her flittering among the  flowers it was hard to say which was the daintier--the blossoms or  Betsy Butterfly.    For that was her name. Whoever gave it to her might have chosen a  prettier one. Betsy herself always said that she would have preferred  Violet. In the first place, it was the name of a flower. And in the  second, her red-and-brown mottled wings had violet tips.    However, a person as charming as Betsy Butterfly did not need worry  about her name. Had she been named after a dozen flowers she could  have been no more attractive.    People often said that everybody was happier and better just for having  Betsy Butterfly in the neighborhood. And some claimed that even the  weather couldn't help being fine when Betsy went abroad.    \"Why, the sun just has to smile on her!\" they would exclaim.    But they were really wrong about that. The truth of the matter was that  Betsy Butterfly couldn't abide bad weather--not even a cloudy sky. She  said she didn't enjoy flying except in the sunshine. So no one ever saw  her except on pleasant days.    To be sure, a few of the field people turned up their noses at Betsy.  They were the jealous ones. And they generally pretended that they did  not consider Betsy beautiful at all.    \"She has too much color,\" Mehitable Moth remarked one day to Mrs.  Ladybug. \"Between you and me, I've an idea that it isn't natural. I  think she paints her wings!\"    \"I don't doubt it,\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"I should think she'd be ashamed  of herself.\" And little Mrs. Ladybug pursed up her lips and looked very  severe. And then she declared that she didn't see how people could say  Betsy was even good-looking, if they had ever noticed her tongue.  \"Honestly, her tongue's as long as she is!\" Mrs. Ladybug gossiped. \"But  she knows enough to carry it curled up like a watch-spring, so it isn't  generally seen.... You just gaze at her closely, some day when she's  sipping nectar from a flower, and you'll see that I know what I'm  talking about.\"    Now, some of those spiteful remarks may have reached Betsy Butterfly's  ears. But she never paid the slightest attention to them. When she met  Mehitable Moth or Mrs. Ladybug she always said, \"How do you do?\" and  \"Isn't this a _lovely_ day?\" in the sweetest tone you could imagine.    And of course there was nothing a body could do except to agree with  Betsy Butterfly. For it was bound to be a beautiful, bright day, or she  wouldn't have been out.    So even those that didn't like Betsy had to give up trying to quarrel  with her.          II    JOHNNIE GREEN'S NET      JOHNNIE GREEN was never quite happy unless he was collecting something.  One year he went about with a hammer, chipping a piece off almost every  rock in Pleasant Valley. And of course he gathered birds' eggs.    After he tired of that he began collecting postage stamps. Next he  turned his attention to tobacco tags, even hailing travellers who passed  the house, to ask them whether they hadn't a \"hard one,\" meaning by that  a tag that was hard to get.    When he felt quite sure that he had a sample of every kind of tobacco  tag in the whole world, Johnnie Green had to think of something else  to collect. And since it was summer, and a good time to find them, he  decided to start a collection of butterflies.    News spreads fast among the field people; and almost as soon as Johnnie  Green had made up his mind about his new collection, the whole Butterfly  family knew of it.    Old Mr. Crow was the one that first learned of Johnnie's plan. And he  was not pleased, either.    \"Butterflies!\" he scoffed. \"I should think Johnnie Green might better  spend his time doing something worth while. Butterflies, indeed! Now,  if he would only collect Crows there'd be some sense in that!\"    But that was before old Mr. Crow and his neighbors understood exactly  what a collection was. And the Butterflies felt quite proud because  Johnnie Green was going to busy himself with them.    Later, when the field people discovered that collecting Butterflies  meant catching them and sticking pins through their heads, the Butterfly  family became greatly excited and worried. And as for old Mr. Crow, he  was very glad that Johnnie had not decided to collect him and his  relations.    Well, if you had been in Pleasant Valley that summer, on almost any fine  day you might have seen Johnnie Green running about the fields or the  flower garden with a butterfly net in his hand.    He had made the net from a barrel hoop and a piece of mosquito netting,  to which he nailed an old broomstick for a handle. And for the first few  days when he started making his new collection he didn't visit the  swimming hole once. When his father asked him to do a little work for  him--such as feeding the chickens, or leading the old horse Ebenezer  to water--Johnnie Green was not so pleasant as he might have been. He  complained that he was too busy to bother with the farm chores just  then.    But Farmer Green told him to run along and do his work.    \"You'll have plenty of time to play,\" said Johnnie's father.    The Butterfly family was sorry that Farmer Green didn't keep his boy at  work from dawn till dark. They didn't like to have to watch out for fear  that horrid net might swoop down upon them and catch them. They wanted  to have a good time among the flowers without being in constant terror  of capture at the hands of Johnnie Green.    But, strange to say, Betsy Butterfly was not in the least uneasy. She  was so gentle herself that she couldn't believe anybody would harm her.    Little did Betsy realize that she was really in great danger. Her fatal  beauty was sure to catch Johnnie Green's eye. And though Betsy Butterfly  did not know it, only an accident could prevent her being added to  Johnnie Green's collection.          III    A MISHAP      EXCEPT for the work that his father made him do now and then, there was  only one thing that bothered Johnnie Green in making his collection of  butterflies. The weather was not so good as it might have been. He soon  found that there was no use hunting for butterflies except in the  sunshine. So when a three days' rain came, Johnnie began to wish he  had started a different sort of collection.    But the weather cleared at last. And the sun came out so bright that  Johnnie fairly pulled old Ebenezer away from the watering-trough and  hustled him back to his stall; for he was in a hurry to get to the  flower garden with his butterfly net. As for the chickens, they had  very little food that day.    Once in the garden, Johnnie Green found more butterflies than he had  ever noticed before. But as soon as he began chasing them, they flew  away to the meadow. That is, all but Betsy Butterfly. She said she was  sure Johnnie Green wouldn't annoy her.    And that was where she was wrong. The moment he caught sight of her,  with her mottled red-and-brown wings with the violet tips, Johnnie  cried: \"There's a beauty!\"    But Betsy Butterfly was so used to such remarks that she paid little  heed to him. Even when he crept nearer and nearer to her, with old dog  Spot at his heels, she did not take fright.    With her tongue deep in a fragrant blossom she was enjoying its  delicious sweetness when Johnnie Green, bearing his net aloft, sprang  at her.    When Johnnie jumped, Betsy Butterfly started up in alarm. She had really  waited until it was too late. And if something unexpected hadn't  happened to Johnnie Green, Betsy would surely have had a place in his  collection.    But luckily for her, Johnnie met with a fall. He may have tripped on a  vine. Or his foot may have slipped on the wet ground. Anyhow, he fell  sprawling among the flowers, dropping his precious net as he stretched  out his hands to save himself."]]]
