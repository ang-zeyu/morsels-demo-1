Copyright by W. S. B. Mathews, 1891.          TO    DR. FLORENCE ZIEGFELD,    _President of the Chicago Musical College_    THIS WORK IS    RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED.          PREFACE.      I have here endeavored to provide a readable account of the entire  history of the art of music, within the compass of a single small  volume, and to treat the luxuriant and many-sided later development  with the particularity proportionate to its importance, and the  greater interest appertaining to it from its proximity to the times of  the reader.    The range of the work can be most easily estimated from the Table of  Contents (pages 5-10). It will be seen that I have attempted to cover  the same extent of history, in treating of which the standard musical  histories of Naumann, Ambros, Fetis and others have employed from  three times to ten times as much space. In the nature of the case  there will be differences of opinion among competent judges concerning  my success in this difficult undertaking. Upon this point I can only  plead absolute sincerity of purpose, and a certain familiarity with  the ground to be covered, due to having treated it in my lectures in  the Chicago Musical College for five years, to the extent of about  thirty-five lectures yearly. I have made free use of all the standard  histories--those of Fetis, Ambros, Naumann, Brendel, Gevaert, Hawkins,  Burney, the writings of Dr. Hugo Riemann, Dr. Ritter, Prof. Fillmore,  and the dictionaries of Grove and Mendel, as well as many monographs  in all the leading modern languages.    I have divided the entire history into books, placing at the beginning  of each book a general chapter defining the central idea and salient  features of the step in development therein recounted. The student who  will attentively peruse these chapters in succession will have in them  a fairly complete account of the entire progress.    W. S. B.

King, M.A., Litt.D., F.S.A.      Assistant Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British  Museum    Professor in the University of London King's College      First Published 1918 by Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press.      THE BRITISH ACADEMY    THE SCHWEICH LECTURES 1916           PREPARER'S NOTE         This text was prepared from a 1920 edition of the book,       hence the references to dates after 1916 in some places.         Greek text has been transliterated within brackets \"{}\"       using an Oxford English Dictionary alphabet table.       Diacritical marks have been lost.          PREFACE    In these lectures an attempt is made, not so much to restate familiar  facts, as to accommodate them to new and supplementary evidence which  has been published in America since the outbreak of the war. But even  without the excuse of recent discovery, no apology would be needed for  any comparison or contrast of Hebrew tradition with the mythological  and legendary beliefs of Babylon and Egypt. Hebrew achievements in the  sphere of religion and ethics are only thrown into stronger relief when  studied against their contemporary background.    The bulk of our new material is furnished by some early texts, written  towards the close of the third millennium B.C. They incorporate  traditions which extend in unbroken outline from their own period into  the remote ages of the past, and claim to trace the history of man back  to his creation. They represent the early national traditions of  the Sumerian people, who preceded the Semites as the ruling race in  Babylonia; and incidentally they necessitate a revision of current  views with regard to the cradle of Babylonian civilization. The most  remarkable of the new documents is one which relates in poetical  narrative an account of the Creation, of Antediluvian history, and of  the Deluge. It thus exhibits a close resemblance in structure to the  corresponding Hebrew traditions, a resemblance that is not shared by the  Semitic-Babylonian Versions at present known. But in matter the Sumerian  tradition is more primitive than any of the Semitic versions. In spite  of the fact that the text appears to have reached us in a magical  setting, and to some extent in epitomized form, this early document  enables us to tap the stream of tradition at a point far above any at  which approach has hitherto been possible.    Though the resemblance of early Sumerian tradition to that of the  Hebrews is striking, it furnishes a still closer parallel to the  summaries preserved from the history of Berossus. The huge figures  incorporated in the latter's chronological scheme are no longer to be  treated as a product of Neo-Babylonian speculation; they reappear in  their original surroundings in another of these early documents, the  Sumerian Dynastic List. The sources of Berossus had inevitably been  semitized by Babylon; but two of his three Antediluvian cities find  their place among the five of primitive Sumerian belief, and two of his  ten Antediluvian kings rejoin their Sumerian prototypes. Moreover, the  recorded ages of Sumerian and Hebrew patriarchs are strangely alike.  It may be added that in Egypt a new fragment of the Palermo Stele has  enabled us to verify, by a very similar comparison, the accuracy of  Manetho's sources for his prehistoric period, while at the same time  it demonstrates the way in which possible inaccuracies in his system,  deduced from independent evidence, may have arisen in remote antiquity.  It is clear that both Hebrew and Hellenistic traditions were modelled on  very early lines.    Thus our new material enables us to check the age, and in some measure  the accuracy, of the traditions concerning the dawn of history which  the Greeks reproduced from native sources, both in Babylonia and Egypt,  after the conquests of Alexander had brought the Near East within the  range of their intimate acquaintance. The third body of tradition, that  of the Hebrews, though unbacked by the prestige of secular achievement,  has, through incorporation in the canons of two great religious systems,  acquired an authority which the others have not enjoyed. In re-examining  the sources of all three accounts, so far as they are affected by the  new discoveries, it will be of interest to observe how the same problems  were solved in antiquity by very different races, living under widely  divergent conditions, but within easy reach of one another. Their  periods of contact, ascertained in history or suggested by geographical  considerations, will prompt the further question to what extent each  body of belief was evolved in independence of the others. The close  correspondence that has long been recognized and is now confirmed  between the Hebrew and the Semitic-Babylonian systems, as compared with  that of Egypt, naturally falls within the scope of our enquiry.    Excavation has provided an extraordinarily full archaeological  commentary to the legends of Egypt and Babylon; and when I received the  invitation to deliver the Schweich Lectures for 1916, I was reminded of  the terms of the Bequest and was asked to emphasize the archaeological  side of the subject. Such material illustration was also calculated to  bring out, in a more vivid manner than was possible with purely literary  evidence, the contrasts and parallels presented by Hebrew tradition.  Thanks to a special grant for photographs from the British Academy,  I was enabled to illustrate by means of lantern slides many of the  problems discussed in the lectures; and it was originally intended that  the photographs then shown should appear as plates in this volume.  But in view of the continued and increasing shortage of paper, it  was afterwards felt to be only right that all illustrations should  be omitted. This very necessary decision has involved a recasting of  certain sections of the lectures as delivered, which in its turn has  rendered possible a fuller treatment of the new literary evidence. To  the consequent shifting of interest is also due a transposition of names  in the title. On their literary side, and in virtue of the intimacy of  their relation to Hebrew tradition, the legends of Babylon must be given  precedence over those of Egypt.    For the delay in the appearance of the volume I must plead the pressure  of other work, on subjects far removed from archaeological study  and affording little time and few facilities for a continuance of  archaeological and textual research. It is hoped that the insertion  of references throughout, and the more detailed discussion of problems  suggested by our new literary material, may incline the reader to add  his indulgence to that already extended to me by the British Academy.    L. W. KING.            LEGENDS OF BABYLON AND EGYPT    IN RELATION TO HEBREW TRADITION          LECTURE I--EGYPT, BABYLON, AND PALESTINE, AND SOME TRADITIONAL ORIGINS  OF CIVILIZATION    At the present moment most of us have little time or thought to spare  for subjects not connected directly or indirectly with the war. We have  put aside our own interests and studies; and after the war we shall all  have a certain amount of leeway to make up in acquainting ourselves  with what has been going on in countries not yet involved in the great  struggle. Meanwhile the most we can do is to glance for a moment at any  discovery of exceptional interest that may come to light.    The main object of these lectures will be to examine certain Hebrew  traditions in the light of new evidence which has been published in  America since the outbreak of the war. The evidence is furnished by some  literary texts, inscribed on tablets from Nippur, one of the oldest  and most sacred cities of Babylonia. They are written in Sumerian, the  language spoken by the non-Semitic people whom the Semitic Babylonians  conquered and displaced; and they include a very primitive version of  the Deluge story and Creation myth, and some texts which throw new light  on the age of Babylonian civilization and on the area within which it  had its rise. In them we have recovered some of the material from which  Berossus derived his dynasty of Antediluvian kings, and we are thus  enabled to test the accuracy of the Greek tradition by that of the  Sumerians themselves. So far then as Babylonia is concerned, these  documents will necessitate a re-examination of more than one problem.    The myths and legends of ancient Egypt are also to some extent involved.  The trend of much recent anthropological research has been in the  direction of seeking a single place of origin for similar beliefs and  practices, at least among races which were bound to one another by  political or commercial ties. And we shall have occasion to test, by  means of our new data, a recent theory of Egyptian influence. The Nile  Valley was, of course, one the great centres from which civilization  radiated throughout the ancient East; and, even when direct contact  is unproved, Egyptian literature may furnish instructive parallels and  contrasts in any study of Western Asiatic mythology. Moreover, by a  strange coincidence, there has also been published in Egypt since the  beginning of the war a record referring to the reigns of predynastic  rulers in the Nile Valley. This, like some of the Nippur texts, takes us  back to that dim period before the dawn of actual history, and, though  the information it affords is not detailed like theirs, it provides  fresh confirmation of the general accuracy of Manetho's sources, and  suggests some interesting points for comparison.    But the people with whose traditions we are ultimately concerned are the  Hebrews. In the first series of Schweich Lectures, delivered in the year  1908, the late Canon Driver showed how the literature of Assyria and  Babylon had thrown light upon Hebrew traditions concerning the origin  and"]]]
