GINN & COMPANY, PUBLISHERS    The Athenaeum Press    1904            COPYRIGHT, 1901, BY    LORIN L. DAME AND HENRY BROOKS      ALL RIGHTS RESERVED          PREFACE.      There is no lack of good manuals of botany in this country. There still  seems place for an adequately illustrated book of convenient size for  field use. The larger manuals, moreover, cover extensive regions and  sometimes fail by reason of their universality to give a definite idea  of plants as they grow within more limited areas. New England marks a  meeting place of the Canadian and Alleghanian floras. Many southern  plants, long after they have abandoned more elevated situations  northward, continue to advance up the valleys of the Connecticut and  Merrimac rivers, in which they ultimately disappear entirely or else  reappear in the valley of the St. Lawrence; while many northern plants  pushing southward maintain a more or less precarious existence upon the  mountain summits or in the cold swamps of New England, and sometimes  follow along the mountain ridges to the middle or southern states. In  addition to these two floras, some southwestern and western species have  invaded Vermont along the Champlain valley, and thrown out pickets still  farther eastward.    At or near the limit of a species, the size and habit of plants undergo  great change; in the case of trees, to which this book is restricted,  often very noticeable. There is no fixed, absolute dividing line between  trees and shrubs. In accordance with the usual definition, a tree must  have a single trunk, unbranched at or near the base, and must be at  least fifteen feet in height.    Trees that are native in New England, or native in other sections of the  United States and thoroughly established in New England, are described  and, for the most part, figured. Foreign trees, though locally  established, are not figured. Trees may be occasionally spontaneous  over a large area without really forming a constituent part of the  flora. Even the apple and pear, when originating spontaneously and  growing without cultivation, quickly become degenerate and show little  tendency to possess themselves of the soil at the expense of the native  growths. Gleditsia, for example, while clearly locally established, has  with some hesitation been accorded pictorial representation.    The geographical distribution is treated under three heads: Canada and  Alaska; New England; south of New England and westward. With regard to  the distribution outside of New England, the standard authorities have  been followed. An effort extending through several years has been made  to give the distribution as definitely as possible in each of the New  England states, and while previous publications have been freely  consulted, the present work rests mainly upon the observations of living  botanists.    All descriptions are based upon the habit of trees as they appear in New  England, unless special mention is made to the contrary. The  descriptions are designed to apply to trees as they grow in open land,  with full space for the development of their characteristics under  favorable conditions. In forest trees there is much greater uniformity;  the trunks are more slender, taller, often unbranched to a considerable  height, and the heads are much smaller.    When the trunk tapers uniformly from the ground upward, the given  diameter is taken at the base; when the trunk is reinforced at the base,  the measurements are made above the swell of the roots; when reinforced  at the ground and also at the branching point, as often in the American  elm, the measurements are made at the smallest place between the swell  of the roots and of the branches.    A regular order has been followed in the description for the purpose of  ready comparison. No explanation of the headings used seems necessary,  except to state that the _habitat_ is used in the more customary present  acceptation to indicate the place where a plant naturally grows, as in  swamps or upon dry hillsides. Under the head of \"Horticultural Value,\"  the requisite information is given for an intelligent choice of trees  for ornamental purposes.    The order and names of families follow, in the main, Engler and Prantl.  In accordance with the general tendency of New England botanists to  conform to the best usage until an authoritative agreement has been  reached with regard to nomenclature by an international congress, the  Berlin rule has been followed for genera, and priority under the genus  for species. Other names in use at the present day are given as synonyms  and included in the index.    Only those common names are given which are actually used in some part  of New England, whether or not the same name is applied to different  trees. It seems best to record what is, and not what ought to be. Common  names that are the creation of botanists have been disregarded  altogether. Any attempt to displace a name in wide use, even by one that  is more appropriate, is futile, if not mischievous.    The plates are from original drawings by Mrs. Elizabeth Gleason Bigelow,  in all cases from living specimens, and they have been carefully  compared with the plates in other works. So far as practicable, the  drawings were made of life size, with the exception of the dissected  portions of small flowers, which were enlarged. In this way, though not  on a perfectly uniform scale, they are, when reduced to the necessary  space, distinct in all their parts.    So far as consistent with due precision, popular terms have been used in  description, but not when such usage involved tedious periphrase.    Especial mention should be made of those botanists whose assistance has  been essential to a knowledge of the distribution of species in the New  England states: Maine,--Mr. M. L. Fernald; New Hampshire,--Mr. Wm. F.  Flint, Report of Forestry Commission; Vermont,--President Ezra Brainerd;  Massachusetts,--trees about Northampton, Mrs. Emily Hitchcock Terry;  throughout the Connecticut river valley, Mr. E. L. Morris; Rhode  Island,--Professor W. W. Bailey, Professor J. F. Collins;  Connecticut,--Mr. C. H. Bissell, Mr. C. K. Averill, Mr. J. N. Bishop.  Dr. B. L. Robinson has given advice in general treatment and in matters  of nomenclature; Dr. C. W. Swan and Mr. Charles H. Morss have made a  critical examination of the manuscript; Mr. Warren H. Manning has  contributed the \"Horticultural Values\" throughout the work; and Miss M.  S. E. James has prepared the index. To these and to all others who have  given assistance in the preparation of this work, the grateful thanks of  the authors are due.          CONTENTS.

GALLANTRY AND COQUETRY       XXIX. IN CONCLUSION          INTRODUCTION    As a rule, books of etiquette are written from the standpoint of the  ultra-fashionable circle.  They give large space to the details of  behavior on occasions of extreme conventionality, and describe minutely  the conduct proper on state occasions.  But the majority in every town  and village are people of moderate means and quiet habits of living, to  whom the extreme formalities of the world of fashion will always remain  something of an abstraction, and the knowledge of them is not of much  practical use except to the few who are reflective enough to infer  their own particular rule from any illustration of the general code.    Though it is interesting as a matter of information to know how a state  dinner is conducted, still, as a matter of fact, the dinners usually  given within this broad zone of \"the average\" are served without the  assistance of butler, footman, or florist; innocent of wines and minus  the more elaborate and expensive courses; and though served _a la  Russe_ the service is under the watchful supervision of the hostess  herself and executed by the more or less skillful hand of a demure  maid-servant.  Yet, in all essential points, the laws of etiquette  controlling the conduct of this simple dinner of the American democrat  are the same as those observed in the ceremonious banquet of the  ambitious aristocrat.  The degree of formality varies; the quality of  courtesy is unchanging.    Well-mannered people are those who are at all times thoughtfully  observant of _little_ proprieties Such people do not \"forget their  manners\" when away from home.  They eat at the hotel table as daintily  and with as polite regard for the comfort of their nearest neighbor as  though they were among critical acquaintances.  They never elbow  mercilessly through crowded theatre aisles, nor stand up in front of  others to see the pictures of a panorama, nor allow their children to  climb upon the car seats with muddy or rough-nailed shoes; nor do a  score of other things that every day are to be observed in public  places, the mortifying tell-tale marks of an _habitual_ ill-manners.    The importance of constant attention to points of etiquette cannot be  too earnestly emphasized.  The long lecture of instruction to the  little Ruggles', preparatory to their visit to the Birds, is a  comical--if burlesque--illustration of the emergency that sometimes  faces some people, that of suddenly preparing to \"behave themselves\" on  a great occasion.  Although the little Ruggles' were fired with  ambition to do themselves credit, their crude preparation was not equal  to the occasion.  The best of intentions could not at once take the  place of established custom.  One might as well hastily wrap himself in  a yard or two of uncut broadcloth expecting it to be transformed, by  instant miracle, into a coat.  The garment must be cut and fitted, and  adjusted and worn for a space of time before it can become the  well-fitting habit, worn with the easy grace of unconsciousness which  marks the habitually well-mannered.    In this brief volume I have endeavored to suggest some of the  fundamental laws of good behavior in every-day life.  It is hoped that  the conclusions reached, while not claiming to be either exhaustive or  infallible, may be useful as far as they go.  Where authorities differ  as to forms I have stated the rule which has the most widespread  sanction of good usage.          ETIQUETTE      ETHICS OF ETIQUETTE    Etiquette is the term applied to correct behavior in social life, and  refers to the manner of actions and the expression of a proper social  spirit through the medium of established forms and ceremonies.  Polite  usage recognizes certain minute distinctions between the mannerly and  the unmannerly ways of performing every act of life that affects the  comfort and happiness of others.    By one whose experience in life has been a hardening process tending in  the direction of a crystallized selfishness the rules of etiquette are  regarded with contempt and alluded to with a sneer.  No more  disheartening problem faces the social reformer than the question how  to overcome the bitter hostility to refined manners which marks the  ignorant \"lower classes.\"  On the other hand, there is no more hopeful  sign of progress in civilization than the gradual softening of these  hard natures under the influence of social amenities.  The secret of  successful missionary work lies primarily, not in tracts, nor in  dogmas, nor in exhortations, but in the subtle attraction of a refined,  benevolent spirit, breathing its very self into the lives of those who  have hitherto known only the rasping, grasping selfishness of their  fellow-men, and to whom this new gospel of brotherly kindness and  deference is a marvelous revelation and inspiration.  The result of  such missionary work is a triumph of sanctified courtesy, a triumph not  unworthy the disciples of Him who \"went about doing good\" while  teaching and exemplifying the \"golden rule\" upon which all rules of  etiquette, however \"worldly,\" are based.    Perhaps it may sometimes seem that there is little relation, possibly  even some antagonism, between the sincerity of perfect courtesy and the  proprieties of formal etiquette.  At times etiquette requires us to do  things that are not agreeable to our selfish impulses, and to say  things that are not literally true if our secret feelings were known.  But there is no instance wherein the laws of etiquette need transgress  the law of sincerity when the ultimate purpose of each action is to  develop and sustain social harmony.    Sometimes, for example, we invite people to visit us, and we pay visits  in return, when both occasions are, on the face of it, a bore.  Yet  there may be good reasons why we should sacrifice any mere impulse of  choice and exert ourselves to manifest a hospitable spirit toward  certain people who are most uncongenial to us.  Sometimes for the sake  of another who is dear to us, and who, in turn, is attached to these  same unattractive people, we make the third line of the triangle  cheerfully, and even gladly, no matter how onerous the task, how  distasteful the association forced upon us.  These are not happy  experiences, but they are tests of character that we are all liable to  meet and which prove a most excellent discipline if they are met with  discretion and patience.  Moreover, in the conscientious effort to be  agreeable to disagreeable people we are tacitly trying to persuade  ourselves that they are not so disagreeable after all, and indeed such  is our surprising discovery in many instances.  Let us hope that others  who exercise a similar forbearance toward ourselves are equally  flattering in the conclusions which they reach.    Etiquette requires that we shall treat all people with equal courtesy,  given the same conditions.  It has a tendency to ignore the  individuality of people.  We may not slight one man simply because we  do not like him, nor may we publicly exhibit extreme preference for the  one whom we do like.  In both cases the rebel against the restraints of  social mice shouts the charge of \"insincerity.\"  Well, perhaps some of  the impulses of sincerity are better held in check; they are too  closely allied to the humoring of our cherished prejudices.  If \"tact  consists in knowing what not to say,\" etiquette consists in knowing  what not to do in the direction of manifesting our impulsive likes and  dislikes.    Besides, etiquette is"]]]
