In connection with these collections, I am indebted to Mr. Frank H.  Cushing for the preparation of the field catalogue for the collection  from Zuñi. His thorough knowledge of the Zuñi language enabled him to  obtain the Indian name of most of the articles procured, which names  are given in this catalogue. I have also to thank him for valuable  assistance in making the collection. I also take pleasure in expressing  thanks to Mr. Victor Mindeleff for his aid in making the collection,  in which labor he rendered faithful assistance.    Col. L. P. Bradley, commandant of Fort Wingate, extended us many  courtesies and material aid, for which I am pleased to extend thanks.    Hoping the collections of the season form a contribution equally  valuable with those previously procured from the southwest,    I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,      JAMES STEVENSON.          Prof. J. W. POWELL, _Director Bureau of Ethnology_.          ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE OF THE COLLECTIONS OF 1881.    By James Stevenson.      INTRODUCTORY.    The following catalogue contains a descriptive enumeration of the  archaeologic and ethnologic specimens collected in Arizona and New  Mexico during the season of 1881. These collections were all obtained  from the pueblo of Zuñi in Northwestern New Mexico, and the pueblos  comprising the province of Tusayan, in Northeastern Arizona. The entire  collection contains about four thousand nine hundred specimens.    The articles of stone consist of axes, in various conditions of  preservation. Some are quite perfect, while many are more or less  impaired by modern uses, for which they were not originally intended.  In nearly all instances they are grooved, and a few are provided with  double splitting or cutting edges; but as a rule these axes were made  with one end blunt for pounding or hammering, while the opposite end is  provided with an edge. The large pestles and mortars were designed for  crushing grain and food, the small ones for grinding and mixing mineral  pigments for ceramic or decorative purposes.    Among the articles of stone are about one hundred and fifty hunting and  war amulets. These objects present the most interesting features of the  collection, and were among the most difficult articles to obtain. The  Indians prize them very highly as keepsakes, which they employ in war,  the chase, and sacred ceremonies. Each specimen is specifically referred  to in the catalogue, accompanied with some wood-cut illustrations of  such specimens as possess the greatest significance.    Mr. Frank H. Cushing has presented a full account of the history,  traditions, and uses of these images or gods, in a paper entitled \"Zuñi  Fetiches,\" in the Second Annual Report of the Bureau for 1882, to which  the reader is referred.    In these collections, as in those of the two previous seasons, articles  of clay predominate. They consist of Tinajas, or large, decorated,  vase-shaped water-vessels. These vary in capacity from one to six  gallons, and are the principal vessels used for holding and storing  water for domestic purposes. These vases do not vary greatly in form,  yet the colored designs with which they are ornamented present as many  variations as there are specimens. The causes for these variations, both  in size and ceramic characters, as well as the method of manufacturing  them, are quite fully explained in the notes accompanying my catalogue  of collections from these same localities in the Annual Report of the  Bureau of Ethnology for 1880-'81.    The collection also contains a large number of jug-shaped canteens,  varying in capacity from one pint to three gallons. These vessels, like  an ordinary jug, are provided with a small nozzle, and are used to carry  water and to drink from. They vary in their decorative designs, but are  seldom as elaborate or beautiful as the vases.    In the collection are also clay spoons, ladles, and dippers of two or  three kinds of ware, such as red, white, and black, of various sizes.  Many of these are fancifully decorated. Also pitchers, mugs, and cups  of different patterns, forms, and sizes, variously ornamented in red,  black, and white. A very fine collection of meal or sacred pottery  baskets was obtained. These are also of varied forms or types, some  with handles, terraced and fluted edges or rims, usually decorated  with figures of the tadpole and horned frog, and occasionally with  the representation of the road runner, and frequently with the sacred  butterfly.    The condiment vessels form no small part of the collection. The forms  and styles of these vessels can only be appreciated by reference to the  specific descriptions and illustrations in the catalogue.    A large number of cooking bowls and pots were obtained, but these are  of less interest, as they are in all cases plain black vessels without  ornamentation of any kind. They generally resemble the old-fashioned  cast-iron cooking pot used by Europeans. Occasionally one is found which  is provided with legs, in imitation probably of the skillet or pots used  by the Mexicans of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19608"],[0,"The Story of the Other Wise Man (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration - \"It is the Sign,\" he said.]    THE STORY OF  THE OTHER WISE MAN    BY  HENRY VAN DYKE    ILLUSTRATED    [Illustration - Harper and Brothers Logo]        NEW YORK  HARPER & BROTHERS PUBLISHERS  1896            Copyright 1895, by HARPER & BROTHERS  ---  All rights reserved            Contents  ---  INTRODUCTION  THE SIGN IN THE SKY  BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON  FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE CHILD  IN THE HIDDEN WAY OF SORROW  A PEARL OF GREAT PRICE            ILLUSTRATIONS  ---  \"'IT IS THE SIGN,' HE SAID\"  \"HE CAUGHT IT UP AND READ\"  \"'THERE IS NONE HERE SAVE ME'\"  \"HE HEALED THE SICK\"  \"THE OLD MAN FOLLOWED THE MULTITUDE\"  \"THE OTHER WISE MAN HAD FOUND THE KING\"        [Illustration - The Story of the Other Wise Man]        _Who seeks for heaven alone to save his soul,  May keep the path, but will not reach the goal;  While he who walks in love may wander far,  Yet God will bring him where the blessed are._              You know the story of the Three Wise Men of the East, and how they  traveled from far away to offer their gifts at the manger-cradle in  Bethlehem. But have you ever heard the story of the Other Wise Man, who  also saw the star in its rising, and set out to follow it, yet did not  arrive with his brethren in the presence of the young child Jesus? Of  the great desire of this fourth pilgrim, and how it was denied, yet  accomplished in the denial; of his many wanderings and the probations  of his soul; of the long way of his seeking, and the strange way of his  finding, the One whom he sought--I would tell the tale as I have heard  fragments of it in the Hall of Dreams, in the palace of the Heart of  Man.        THE SIGN IN THE SKY      In the days when Augustus Caesar was master of many kings and Herod  reigned in Jerusalem, there lived in the city of Ecbatana, among the  mountains of Persia, a certain man named Artaban, the Median. His house  stood close to the outermost of the seven walls which encircled the  royal treasury. From his roof he could look over the rising battlements  of black and white and crimson and blue and red and silver and gold, to  the hill where the summer palace of the Parthian emperors glittered  like a jewel in a sevenfold crown.    Around the dwelling of Artaban spread a fair garden, a tangle of  flowers and fruit trees, watered by a score of streams descending from  the slopes of Mount Orontes, and made musical by innumerable birds. But  all color was lost in the soft and odorous darkness of the late  September night, and all sounds were hushed in the deep charm of its  silence, save the plashing of the water, like a voice half sobbing and  half laughing under the shadows. High above the trees a dim glow of  light shone through the curtained arches of the upper chamber, where  the master of the house was holding council with his friends.    He stood by the doorway to greet his guests--a tall, dark man of about  forty years, with brilliant eyes set near together under his broad  brow, and firm lines graven around his fine, thin lips; the brow of a  dreamer and the mouth of soldier, a man of sensitive feeling but  inflexible will--one of those who, in whatever age they may live, are  born for inward conflict and a life of quest.    His robe was of pure white wool, thrown over a tunic of silk; and a  white, pointed cap, with long lapels at the sides, rested on his  flowing black hair. It was the dress of the ancient priesthood of the  Magi, called the fire-worshippers.    \"Welcome!\" he said, in his low, pleasant voice, as one after another  entered the room--\"welcome, Abdus; peace be with you, Rhodaspes and  Tigranes, and with you my father, Abgarus. You are all welcome, and  this house grows bright with the joy of your presence.\"    There were nine of the men, differing widely in age, but alike in the  richness of their dress of many-colored silks, and in the massive  golden collars around their necks, marking them as Parthian nobles, and  in the winged circles of gold resting upon their breasts, the sign of  the followers of Zoroaster.    They took their places around a small black altar at the end of the  room, where a tiny flame was burning. Artaban, standing beside it, and  waving a barsom of thin tamarisk branches above the fire, fed it with  dry sticks of pine and fragrant oils. Then he began the ancient chant  of the Yasna, and the voices of his companions joined in the beautiful  hymn to Ahura-Mazda:    We worship the Spirit Divine,                      all wisdom and goodness possessing,  Surrounded by Holy Immortals,                       the givers of bounty and blessing,  We joy in the works of His hands,                      His truth and His power confessing.    We praise all the things that are pure,                         for these are His only Creation;  The thoughts that are true, and the words                     and deeds that have won approbation;  These are supported by Him                         and for these we make adoration.    Hear us, O Mazda! Thou livest                       in truth and in heavenly gladness;  Cleanse us from falsehood, and keep us                        from evil and bondage to badness;  Pour out the light and the joy of Thy life                             on our darkness and sadness.    Shine on our gardens and fields,          Shine on our working and weaving;  Shine on the whole race of man,          Believing and unbelieving;          Shine on us now through the night,          Shine on us now in Thy might,  The flame of our holy love                   and the song of our worship receiving.    The fire rose with the chant, throbbing as if it were made of musical  flame, until it cast a bright illumination through the whole apartment,  revealing its simplicity and splendor.    The floor was laid with tiles of dark blue veined with white; pilasters  of twisted silver stood out against the blue walls; the clearstory of  round-arched windows above them was hung with azure silk; the vaulted  ceiling was a pavement of sapphires, like the body of heaven in its  clearness, sown with silver stars. From the four corners of the roof  hung four golden magic-wheels, called the tongues of the gods. At the  eastern end, behind the altar, there were two dark-red pillars of  porphyry; above them a lintel of the same stone, on which was carved  the figure of a winged archer, with his arrow set to the string and his  bow drawn.    The doorway between the pillars, which opened upon the terrace of the  roof, was covered with a heavy curtain of the color of a ripe  pomegranate, embroidered with innumerable golden rays shooting upward  from the floor. In effect the room was like a quiet, starry night, all  azure and silver, flushed in the east with rosy promise of the dawn. It  was, as the house of a man should be, an expression of the character  and spirit of the master.    He turned to his friends when the song was ended, and invited them to  be seated on the divan at the western end of the room.    \"You have come to-night,\" said he, looking around the circle, \"at my  call, as the faithful scholars of Zoroaster, to renew your worship and  rekindle your faith in the God of Purity, even as this fire has been  rekindled on the altar. We worship not the fire, but Him of whom it is  the chosen symbol, because it is the purest of all created things. It  speaks to us of one who is Light and Truth. Is it not so, my father?\"    \"It is well said, my son,\" answered the venerable Abgarus. \"The  enlightened are never idolaters. They lift the veil of the form and go  in to the shrine of the reality, and new light and truth are coming to  them continually through the old symbols.\"    \"Hear me, then, my father and my friends,\" said Artaban, very quietly,  \"while I tell you of the new light and truth that have come to me  through the most ancient of all signs. We have searched the secrets of  nature together, and studied the healing virtues of water and fire and  the plants. We have read also the books of prophecy in which the future  is dimly foretold in words that are hard to understand. But the highest  of all learning is the knowledge of the stars. To trace their courses  is to untangle the threads of the mystery of life from the beginning to  the end. If we could follow them perfectly, nothing would be hidden  from us. But is not our knowledge of them still incomplete? Are there  not many stars still beyond our horizon--lights that are known only to  the dwellers in the far south-land, among the spice-trees of Punt and  the gold-mines of Ophir?\"    There was a murmur of assent among the listeners.    \"The stars,\" said Tigranes, \"are the thoughts of the Eternal. They are  numberless. But the thoughts of man can be counted, like the years of  his life. The wisdom of the Magi is the greatest of all wisdoms on  earth, because it knows its own ignorance. And that is the secret of  power. We keep men always looking and waiting for a new sunrise. But we  ourselves know that the darkness is equal to the light, and that the  conflict between them will never be ended.\"    \"That does not satisfy me,\" answered Artaban, \"for, if the waiting must  be endless, if there could be no fulfilment of it, then it would not be  wisdom to look and wait. We should become like those new teachers of  the Greeks, who say that there is no truth, and that the only wise men  are those who spend their lives in discovering and exposing the lies  that have been believed in the world. But the new sunrise will  certainly dawn in the appointed time. Do not our own books tell us that  this will come to pass, and that men will see the brightness of a great  light?\"    \"That is true,\" said the voice of Abgarus; \"every faithful disciple of  Zoroaster knows the prophecy of the Avesta and carries the word in his  heart. 'In that day Sosiosh the Victorious shall arise out of the  number of the prophets in the east country. Around him shall shine a  mighty brightness, and he shall"]]]
