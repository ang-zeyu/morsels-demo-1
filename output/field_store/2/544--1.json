Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to  have constituted the first volume of his long-projected _magnum opus_,  \"The Will to Power.\" His full plan for this work, as originally drawn  up, was as follows:      Vol.   I.  The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity.      Vol.  II.  The Free Spirit: a Criticism of Philosophy as a Nihilistic               Movement.      Vol. III.  The Immoralist: a Criticism of Morality, the Most Fatal               Form of Ignorance.      Vol.  IV.  Dionysus: the Philosophy of Eternal Recurrence.    The first sketches for \"The Will to Power\" were made in 1884, soon after  the publication of the first three parts of \"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\"  and thereafter, for four years, Nietzsche piled up notes. They were  written at all the places he visited on his endless travels in search of  health--at Nice, at Venice, at Sils-Maria in the Engadine (for long his  favourite resort), at Cannobio, at Zuerich, at Genoa, at Chur, at  Leipzig. Several times his work was interrupted by other books, first by  \"Beyond Good and Evil,\" then by \"The Genealogy of Morals\" (written in  twenty days), then by his Wagner pamphlets. Almost as often he changed  his plan. Once he decided to expand \"The Will to Power\" to ten volumes,  with \"An Attempt at a New Interpretation of the World\" as a general  sub-title. Again he adopted the sub-title of \"An Interpretation of All  That Happens.\" Finally, he hit upon \"An Attempt at a Transvaluation of  All Values,\" and went back to four volumes, though with a number of  changes in their arrangement. In September, 1888, he began actual work  upon the first volume, and before the end of the month it was completed.  The Summer had been one of almost hysterical creative activity. Since  the middle of June he had written two other small books, \"The Case of  Wagner\" and \"The Twilight of the Idols,\" and before the end of the year  he was destined to write \"Ecce Homo.\" Some time during December his  health began to fail rapidly, and soon after the New Year he was  helpless. Thereafter he wrote no more.    The Wagner diatribe and \"The Twilight of the Idols\" were published  immediately, but \"The Antichrist\" did not get into type until 1895. I  suspect that the delay was due to the influence of the philosopher's  sister, Elisabeth Foerster-Nietzsche, an intelligent and ardent but by no  means uniformly judicious propagandist of his ideas. During his dark  days of neglect and misunderstanding, when even family and friends kept  aloof, Frau Foerster-Nietzsche went with him farther than any other, but  there were bounds beyond which she, also, hesitated to go, and those  bounds were marked by crosses. One notes, in her biography of him--a  useful but not always accurate work--an evident desire to purge him of  the accusation of mocking at sacred things. He had, she says, great  admiration for \"the elevating effect of Christianity ... upon the weak  and ailing,\" and \"a real liking for sincere, pious Christians,\" and \"a  tender love for the Founder of Christianity.\" All his wrath, she  continues, was reserved for \"St. Paul and his like,\" who perverted the  Beatitudes, which Christ intended for the lowly only, into a universal  religion which made war upon aristocratic values. Here, obviously, one  is addressed by an interpreter who cannot forget that she is the  daughter of a Lutheran pastor and the grand-daughter of two others; a  touch of conscience gets into her reading of \"The Antichrist.\" She even  hints that the text may have been garbled, after the author's collapse,  by some more sinister heretic. There is not the slightest reason to  believe that any such garbling ever took place, nor is there any  evidence that their common heritage of piety rested upon the brother as  heavily as it rested upon the sister. On the contrary, it must be  manifest that Nietzsche, in this book, intended to attack Christianity  headlong and with all arms, that for all his rapid writing he put the  utmost care into it, and that he wanted it to be printed exactly as it  stands. The ideas in it were anything but new to him when he set them  down. He had been developing them since the days of his beginning. You  will find some of them, clearly recognizable, in the first book he ever  wrote, \"The Birth of Tragedy.\" You will find the most important of all  of them--the conception of Christianity as _ressentiment_--set forth at  length in the first part of \"The Genealogy of Morals,\" published under  his own supervision in 1887. And the rest are scattered through the  whole vast mass of his notes, sometimes as mere questionings but often  worked out very carefully. Moreover, let it not be forgotten that it was  Wagner's yielding to Christian sentimentality in \"Parsifal\" that  transformed Nietzsche from the first among his literary advocates into  the most bitter of his opponents. He could forgive every other sort of  mountebankery, but not that. \"In me,\" he once said, \"the Christianity of  my forbears reaches its logical conclusion. In me the stern intellectual  conscience that Christianity fosters and makes paramount turns _against_  Christianity. In me Christianity ... devours itself.\"    In truth, the present philippic is as necessary to the completeness of  the whole of Nietzsche's system as the keystone is to the arch. All the  curves of his speculation lead up to it. What he flung himself against,  from beginning to end of his days of writing, was always, in the last  analysis, Christianity in some form or other--Christianity as a system  of practical ethics, Christianity as a political code, Christianity as  metaphysics, Christianity as a gauge of the truth. It would be  difficult to think of any intellectual enterprise on his long list that  did not, more or less directly and clearly, relate itself to this master  enterprise of them all. It was as if his apostasy from the  faith of his fathers, filling him with the fiery zeal of the convert,  and particularly of the convert to heresy, had blinded him to every  other element in the gigantic self-delusion of civilized man. The will  to power was his answer to Christianity's affectation of humility and  self-sacrifice; eternal recurrence was his mocking criticism of  Christian optimism and millennialism; the superman was his candidate for  the place of the Christian ideal of the \"good\" man, prudently abased  before the throne of God. The things he chiefly argued for were  anti-Christian things--the abandonment of the purely moral view of life,  the rehabilitation of instinct, the dethronement of weakness and  timidity as ideals, the renunciation of the whole hocus-pocus of  dogmatic religion, the extermination of false aristocracies (of the  priest, of the politician, of the plutocrat), the revival of the  healthy, lordly \"innocence\" that was Greek. If he was anything in a  word, Nietzsche was a Greek born two thousand years too late. His  dreams were thoroughly Hellenic; his whole manner of thinking was  Hellenic; his peculiar errors were Hellenic no less. But his Hellenism,  I need not add, was anything but the pale neo-Platonism that has run  like a thread through the thinking of the Western world since the days  of the Christian Fathers. From Plato, to be sure, he got what all of us  must get, but his real forefather was Heraclitus. It is in Heraclitus  that one finds the germ of his primary view of the universe--a view, to  wit, that sees it, not as moral phenomenon, but as mere aesthetic  representation. The God that Nietzsche imagined, in the end, was not far  from the God that such an artist as Joseph Conrad imagines--a supreme  craftsman, ever experimenting, ever coming closer to an ideal balancing  of lines and forces, and yet always failing to work out the final  harmony.    The late war, awakening all the primitive racial fury of the Western  nations, and therewith all their ancient enthusiasm for religious taboos  and sanctions, naturally focused attention upon Nietzsche, as upon the  most daring and provocative of recent amateur theologians. The Germans,  with their characteristic tendency to explain their every act in terms  as realistic and unpleasant as possible, appear to have mauled him in a  belated and unexpected embrace, to the horror,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#1)"],[1,"of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo  Indians      by James Stevenson          Edition 1, (September 2006)            CONTENTS      INTRODUCTION.

During my visit to the Southwest, in the summer of 1885, it was my good  fortune to arrive at the Navajo Reservation a few days before the  commencement of a Navajo healing ceremonial. Learning of the preparation  for this, I decided to remain and observe the ceremony, which was to  continue nine days and nights. The occasion drew to the place some 1,200  Navajos. The scene of the assemblage was an extensive plateau near the  margin of Keam's Canyon, Arizona.    A variety of singular and interesting occurrences attended this great  event--mythologic rites, gambling, horse and foot racing, general  merriment, and curing the sick, the latter being the prime cause of the  gathering. A man of distinction in the tribe was threatened with loss of  vision from inflammation of the eyes, having looked upon certain masks  with an irreligious heart. He was rich and had many wealthy relations,  hence the elaborateness of the ceremony of healing. A celebrated theurgist  was solicited to officiate, but much anxiety was felt when it was learned  that his wife was pregnant. A superstition prevails among the Navajo that  a man must not look upon a sand painting when his wife is in a state of  gestation, as it would result in the loss of the life of the child. This  medicine man, however, came, feeling that he possessed ample power within  himself to avert such calamity by administering to the child immediately  after its birth a mixture in water of all the sands used in the painting.  As I have given but little time to the study of Navajo mythology, I can  but briefly mention such events as I witnessed, and record the myths only  so far as I was able to collect them hastily. I will first describe the  ceremony of Yebitchai and give then the myths (some complete and others  incomplete) explanatory of the gods and genii figuring in the Hasjelti  Dailjis (dance of Hasjelti) and in the nine days' ceremonial, and then  others independent of these. The ceremony is familiarly called among the  tribe, \"Yebitchai,\" the word meaning the giant's uncle. The name was  originally given to the ceremonial to awe the children who, on the eighth  day of the ceremony, are initiated into some of its mysteries and then for  the first time are informed that the characters appearing in the ceremony  are not real gods, but only their representatives. There is good reason  for believing that their ideas in regard to the sand paintings were  obtained from the Pueblo tribes, who in the past had elaborated sand  paintings and whose work at present in connection with most of their  medicine ceremonies is of no mean order. The Mission Indians of southern  California also regard sand paintings as among the important features in  their medicine practices. While the figures of the mythical beings  represented by the Navajo are no doubt of their own conception, yet I  discovered that all their medicine tubes and offerings were similar to  those in use by the Zuni. Their presence among the Navajo can be readily  explained by the well known fact that it was the custom among Indians of  different tribes to barter and exchange medicine songs, ceremonies, and  the paraphernalia accompanying them. The Zuni and Tusayan claim that the  Navajo obtained the secrets of the Pueblo medicine by intruding upon their  ceremonials or capturing a pueblo, and that they appropriated whatever  suited their fancy.                            [Illustration: Figure 115]                            FIG. 115. Exterior lodge.      My explanation of the ceremonial described is by authority of the priest  doctor who managed the whole affair and who remained with me five days  after the ceremonial for this special purpose. Much persuasion was  required to induce him to stay, though he was most anxious that we should  make no mistake. He said:          My wife may suffer and I should be near her; a father's eyes      should be the first to look upon his child; it is like sunshine in      the father's heart; the father also watches his little one to see      the first signs of understanding, and observes the first steps of      his child, that too is a bright light in the father's heart, but      when the little one falls, it strikes the father's heart hard.      The features of this ceremonial which most surprise the white spectator  are its great elaborateness, the number of its participants and its  prolongation through many days for the purpose of restoring health to a  single member of the tribe.            CONSTRUCTION OF THE MEDICINE LODGE.      A rectangular parallelogram was marked off on the ground, and at each  corner was firmly planted a forked post extending 10 feet above the  surface, and on these were laid 4 horizontal beams, against which rested  poles thickly set at an angle of about 20 deg., while other poles were placed  horizontally across the beams forming a support for the covering. The  poles around the sides were planted more in an oval than a circle and  formed an interior space of about 35 by 30 feet in diameter. On the east  side of the lodge was an entrance supported by stakes and closed with a  buffalo robe, and the whole structure was then thickly covered first with  boughs, then with sand, giving it the appearance of a small earth mound.                            [Illustration: Figure 116]                            FIG. 116. Interior lodge.            FIRST DAY.          PERSONATORS OF THE GODS.      The theurgist or song-priest arrived at noon on the 12th of October, 1885.  Almost immediately after his arrival we boldly entered the medicine lodge,  accompanied by our interpreter, Navajo John, and pleaded our cause. The  stipulation of the medicine man was that we should make no mistakes and  thereby offend the gods, and to avoid mistakes we must hear all of his  songs and see all of his medicines, and he at once ordered some youths to  prepare a place for our tent near the lodge. During the afternoon of the  12th those who were to take part in the ceremonial received orders and  instructions from the song-priest. One man went to collect twigs with  which to make twelve rings, each 6 inches in diameter. These rings  represented gaming rings, which are not only used by the Navajo, but are  thought highly of by the genii of the rocks. (See Fig. 117.) Another man  gathered willows with which to make the emblem of the concentration of the  four winds. The square was made by dressed willows crossed and left  projecting at the corners each one inch beyond the next. The corners were  tied together with white cotton cord, and each corner was ornamented with  the under tail feather of the eagle. These articles were laid in a niche  behind the theurgist, whose permanent seat was on the west side of the  lodge facing east. The night ceremony commenced shortly after dark. All  those who were to participate were immediate friends and relatives of the  invalid excepting the theurgist or song-priest, he being the only one who  received direct compensation for his professional services. The cost of  such a ceremony is no inconsiderable item. Not only the exorbitant fee of  the theurgist must be paid, but the entire assemblage must be fed during  the nine days' ceremonial at the expense of the invalid, assisted by his  near relatives.                          [Illustration: Figure 117]                            FIG. 117. Gaming ring.      A bright fire burned in the lodge, and shortly after dark the invalid  appeared and sat upon a blanket, which was placed in front of the  song-priest. Previously, however, three men had prepared themselves to  personate the gods--Hasjelti, Hostjoghon, and Hostjobokon--and one to  personate the goddess, Hostjoboard. They left the lodge, carrying their  masks in their hands, went a short distance away and put on their masks.  Then Hasjelti and Hostjoghon returned to the lodge, and Hasjelti, amid  hoots, \"hu-hoo-hu-huh!\" placed the square which he carried over the  invalid's head, and Hostjoghon"]]]
