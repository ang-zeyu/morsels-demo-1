Best-beloved brothers and sisters in the love of Baha'u'llah:    It would be difficult indeed to adequately express the feelings of  irrepressible joy and exultation that flood my heart every time I pause to  contemplate the ceaseless evidences of the dynamic energy which animates  the stalwart pioneers of the World Order of Baha'u'llah in the execution  of the Plan committed to their charge. The signature of the contract, by  your elected national representatives, signalizing the opening of the  final phase of the greatest enterprise ever launched by the followers of  the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the West, no less than the extremely  heartening progress recorded in the successive reports of their National  Teaching Committee, attest, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the fidelity,  the vigor, and the thoroughness with which you are conducting the manifold  operations which the evolution of the Seven Year Plan must necessarily  involve. In both of its aspects, and in all its details, it is being  prosecuted with exemplary regularity and precision, with undiminished  efficiency, and commendable dispatch.    The resourcefulness which the national representatives of the American  believers have, in recent months, so strikingly demonstrated, as evidenced  by the successive measures they have adopted, has been matched by the  loyal, the unquestioning and generous support accorded them by all those  whom they represent, at every critical stage, and with every fresh  advance, in the discharge of their sacred duties. Such close interaction,  such complete cohesion, such continual harmony and fellowship between the  various agencies that contribute to the organic life, and constitute the  basic framework, of every properly functioning Baha'i community, is a  phenomenon which offers a striking contrast to the disruptive tendencies  which the discordant elements of present-day society so tragically  manifest. Whereas every apparent trial with which the unfathomable wisdom  of the Almighty deems it necessary to afflict His chosen community serves  only to demonstrate afresh its essential solidarity and to consolidate its  inward strength, each of the successive crises in the fortunes of a  decadent age exposes more convincingly than the one preceding it the  corrosive influences that are fast sapping the vitality and undermining  the basis of its declining institutions.    For such demonstrations of the interpositions of an ever-watchful  Providence they who stand identified with the Community of the Most Great  Name must feel eternally grateful. From every fresh token of His unfailing  blessing on the one hand, and of His visitation on the other, they cannot  but derive immense hope and courage. Alert to seize every opportunity  which the revolutions of the wheel of destiny within their Faith offers  them, and undismayed by the prospect of spasmodic convulsions that must  sooner or later fatally affect those who have refused to embrace its  light, they, and those who will labor after them, must press forward until  the processes now set in motion will have each spent its force and  contributed its share towards the birth of the Order now stirring in the  womb of a travailing age.    These recurrent crises which, with ominous frequency and resistless force,  are afflicting an ever-increasing portion of the human race must of  necessity continue, however impermanently, to exercise, in a certain  measure, their baleful influence upon a world community which has spread  its ramifications to the uttermost ends of the earth. How can the  beginnings of a world upheaval, unleashing forces that are so gravely  deranging the social, the religious, the political, and the economic  equilibrium of organized society, throwing into chaos and confusion  political systems, racial doctrines, social conceptions, cultural  standards, religious associations, and trade relationships--how can such  agitations, on a scale so vast, so unprecedented, fail to produce any  repercussions on the institutions of a Faith of such tender age whose  teachings have a direct and vital bearing on each of these spheres of  human life and conduct?    Little wonder, therefore, if they who are holding aloft the banner of so  pervasive a Faith, so challenging a Cause, find themselves affected by the  impact of these world-shaking forces. Little wonder if they find that in  the midst of this whirlpool of contending passions their freedom has been  curtailed, their tenets contemned, their institutions assaulted, their  motives maligned, their authority jeopardized, their claim rejected.    In the heart of the European continent a community which, as predicted by  'Abdu'l-Baha, is destined, by virtue of its spiritual potentialities and  geographical situation, to radiate the splendor of the light of the Faith  on the countries that surround it, has been momentarily eclipsed through  the restrictions which a regime that has sorely misapprehended its purpose  and function has chosen to impose upon it. Its voice, alas, is now  silenced, its institutions dissolved, its literature banned, its archives  confiscated, and its meetings suspended.    In central Asia, in the city enjoying the unique distinction of having  been chosen by 'Abdu'l-Baha as the home of the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar  of the Baha'i world, as well as in the towns and villages of the province  to which it belongs, the sore-pressed Faith of Baha'u'llah, as a result of  the extraordinary and unique vitality which, in the course of several  decades, it has consistently manifested, finds itself at the mercy of  forces which, alarmed at its rising power, are now bent on reducing it to  utter impotence. Its Temple, though still used for purposes of Baha'i  worship, has been expropriated, its Assemblies and committees disbanded,  its teaching activities crippled, its chief promoters deported, and not a  few of its most enthusiastic supporters, both men and women, imprisoned.    In the land of its birth, wherein reside the immense majority of its  followers--a country whose capital has been hailed by Baha'u'llah as the  \"mother of the world\" and the \"dayspring of the joy of mankind\"--a civil  authority, as yet undivorced officially from the paralyzing influences of  an antiquated, a fanatical, and outrageously corrupt clergy, pursues  relentlessly its campaign of repression against the adherents of a Faith  which it has for well-nigh a century striven unsuccessfully to suppress.  Indifferent to the truth that the members of this innocent and proscribed  community can justly claim to rank as among the most disinterested, the  most competent, and the most ardent lovers of their native land,  contemptuous of their high sense of world citizenship which the advocates  of an excessive and narrow nationalism can never hope to appreciate, such  an authority refuses to grant to a Faith which extends its spiritual  jurisdiction over well-nigh six hundred local communities, and which  numerically outnumbers the adherents of either the Christian, the Jewish,  or the Zoroastrian Faiths in that land, the necessary legal right to  enforce its laws, to administer its affairs, to conduct its schools, to  celebrate its festivals, to circulate its literature, to solemnize its  rites, to erect its edifices, and to safeguard its endowments.    And now recently in the Holy Land itself, the heart and nerve-center of a  world-embracing Faith, the fires of racial animosity, of fratricidal  strife, of unabashed terrorism, have lit a conflagration that gravely  interferes, on the one hand, with that flow of pilgrims that constitutes  the lifeblood of that center, and suspends, on the other, the various  projects that had been initiated in connection with the preservation and  extension of the areas surrounding the sacred Spots it enshrines. The  safety of the small community of resident believers, faced by the rising  tide of lawlessness, has been imperiled, its status as a neutral and  distinct community indirectly challenged, and its freedom to carry out  certain of its observances curtailed.

'ABDU'L-BAHA IN LONDON            THE CITY TEMPLE: INTRODUCTION      On September 10th, the first Sunday after 'Abdu'l-Baha's arrival in  England, he spoke from the City Temple pulpit to the evening congregation  at the special desire of the Pastor, the Reverend R. J. Campbell.    Though 'Abdu'l-Baha's coming had not been advertised the Church was filled  to its utmost capacity. Few that were there will ever forget the sight of  that venerable figure clad in his Eastern garb, ascending the pulpit  stairs to address a public gathering for the first time in his life. That  this should be at a Christian place of worship in the West has its own  deep significance. Mr. Campbell introduced the visitor with a few simple  words in the course of which he said: \"We, as the followers of the Lord  Jesus Christ, who is to us and will always be the Light of the World, view  with sympathy and respect every movement of the Spirit of God in the  experience of mankind, and therefore we give greeting to 'Abdu'l-Baha in  the name of all who share the spirit of our Master, and are trying to live  their lives in that Spirit. The Baha'i Movement is very closely akin to, I  think I might say is identical with, the spiritual purpose of  Christianity.\"    Before 'Abdu'l-Baha left the Church, he wrote in the old Bible used by  generations of preachers, the following words in his own native Persian,  the translation being added as follows:    Inscription in the Old Bible Written by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Persian          This book is the Holy Book of God, of celestial Inspiration. It is      the Bible of Salvation, the Noble Gospel. It is the mystery of the      Kingdom and its light. It is the Divine Bounty, the sign of the      guidance of God.                                                       'Abdu'l-Baha Abbas.            ADDRESS GIVEN BY 'ABDU'L-BAHA AT THE CITY TEMPLE                             Sunday, September 10th, 1911      O noble friends; seekers after God! Praise be to God! Today the light of  Truth is shining upon the world in its abundance; the breezes of the  heavenly garden are blowing throughout all regions; the call of the  Kingdom is heard in all lands, and the breath of the Holy Spirit is felt  in all hearts that are faithful. The Spirit of God is giving eternal life.  In this wonderful age the East is enlightened, the West is fragrant, and  everywhere the soul inhales the holy perfume. The sea of the unity of  mankind is lifting up its waves with joy, for there is real communication  between the hearts and minds of men. The banner of the Holy Spirit is  uplifted, and men see it, and are assured with the knowledge that this is  a new day.    This is a new cycle of human power. All the horizons of the world are  luminous, and the world will become indeed as a garden and a paradise. It  is the hour of unity of the sons of men and of the drawing together of all  races and all classes. You are loosed from ancient superstitions which  have kept men ignorant, destroying the foundation of true humanity.    The gift of God to this enlightened age is the knowledge of the oneness of  mankind and of the fundamental oneness of religion. War shall cease  between nations, and by the will of God the Most Great Peace shall come;  the world will be seen as a new world, and all men will live as brothers.    In the days of old an instinct for warfare was developed in the struggle  with wild animals; this is no longer necessary; nay, rather, co-operation  and mutual understanding are seen to produce the greatest welfare of  mankind. Enmity is now the result of prejudice only.    In the Hidden Words Baha'u'llah says, \"Justice is to be loved above all.\"  Praise be to God, in this country the standard of justice has been raised;  a great effort is being made to give all souls an equal and a true place.  This is the desire of all noble natures; this is today the teaching for  the East and for the West; therefore the East and the West will understand  each other and reverence each other, and embrace like long-parted lovers  who have found each other.    There is one God; mankind is one; the foundations of religion are one. Let  us worship Him, and give praise for all His great Prophets and Messengers  who have manifested His brightness and glory.    The blessing of the Eternal One be with you in all its richness, that each  soul according to his measure may take freely of Him. Amen.          This Address is printed by kind permission, from The Christian      Commonwealth of September 13th, 1911. Spoken by 'Abdu'l-Baha in      Persian from the city Temple pulpit, the above translation was      then read to the congregation by Mr. W. Tudor-Pole.            ST. JOHN'S WESTMINSTER: INTRODUCTION      On September 17th, 'Abdu'l-Baha at the request of the venerable Archdeacon  of Westminster addressed the congregation of Saint John the Divine after  evening service. With a few warm words characteristic of his whole  attitude Archdeacon Wilberforce introduced the revered Messenger from the  East, who had crossed seas and countries on his Mission of Peace and Unity  for which he had suffered forty years of captivity and persecution. The  Archdeacon had the Bishop's chair placed for his Guest on the Chancel  steps, and standing beside him read the translation of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  address himself. The Congregation was profoundly moved, and following the  Archdeacon's example knelt to receive the blessing of the Servant of  God--who stood with extended arms--his wonderful voice rising and falling in  the silence with the power of his invocation. As the Archdeacon said:  \"Truly the East and the West have met in this sacred place tonight.\" The  hymn \"O God our help in ages past\" was sung by the entire assembly  standing, as 'Abdu'l-Baha and the Archdeacon passed down the aisle to the  vestry hand in hand.    Outside the Church, Salvationists were holding their meeting and  'Abdu'l-Baha was deeply impressed and touched at the sight of the men,  women and children gathered together in the night, at the street corner,  praying and singing.            DISCOURSE OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA AT ST. JOHN'S, WESTMINSTER.                                September 17th, 1911.      O Noble Friends! O Seekers for the Kingdom of God! Man all over the world  is seeking for God. All that exists is God; but the Reality of Divinity is  holy above all understanding.    The pictures of Divinity that come to our mind are the product of our  fancy; they exist in the realm of our imagination. They are not adequate  to the Truth; truth in its essence cannot be put into words.    Divinity cannot by comprehended because it is comprehending.    Man, who has also a real existence, is comprehended by God; therefore, the  Divinity which man can understand is partial; it is not complete. Divinity  is actual Truth and real existence, and not any representation of it.  Divinity itself contains All, and is not contained.    Although the mineral, vegetable, animal and man all have actual being, yet  the mineral has no knowledge of the vegetable. It cannot apprehend it. It  cannot imagine nor understand it.    It is the same with the vegetable. Any progress it may make, however  highly it may become developed, it will never apprehend the animal, nor "]]]
