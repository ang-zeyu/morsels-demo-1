Partly to make this the same  size as the other books, but more particularly because I especially  desired to give a permanent place to some of the most dramatic and  interesting episodes in our history--especially as most of them related  to the Pacific and the Far West--the series of papers in part second  was included.    \"The Yarn of the _Essex_, Whaler\" is abridged from a quaint account  written by the Mate and published in an old volume which is long since  out of print and very scarce.  The papers on the _Tonquin_, John Paul  Jones, and \"The Great American Duellists\" speak for themselves.  The  account of the battle of the Pitt River has never been published in  book form heretofore.  The last paper \"On Being a Boy Out West\" I  inserted because I enjoy it myself, and because I have found that  others young and old who have read it generally like it also.    Thanks are due and are hereby extended to the following magazines for  permission to republish various articles which originally appeared in  their pages: _Harper's_, _Munseys_, _The Cosmopolitan_, _Sunset_ and  _The New Era_.    I project another volume of the Series supplementing the two Indian  volumes immediately preceding this one, but the information is hard to  get, and the work amid many other demands upon my time, proceeds slowly.

The Spanish Main    One of the commonly misunderstood phrases in the language is \"the  Spanish Main.\"  To the ordinary individual it suggests the Caribbean  Sea.  Although Shakespeare in \"Othello,\" makes one of the gentlemen of  Cyprus say that he \"cannot 'twixt heaven and main descry a sail,\" and,  therefore, with other poets, gives warrant to the application of the  word to the ocean, \"main\" really refers to the other element.  The  Spanish Main was that portion of South American territory distinguished  from Cuba, Hispaniola and the other islands, because it was on the main  land.    When the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea were a Spanish lake, the  whole circle of territory, bordering thereon was the Spanish Main, but  of late the title has been restricted to Central and South America.  The buccaneers are those who made it famous.  So the word brings up  white-hot stories of battle, murder and sudden death.

Her clear skin was tinted with the faintest pink, and there was in  the sober depths of those grey eyes of hers a light which would have  warned a man less satisfied with his own genius and power of persuasion  than Thornton Lyne.    He was not looking at her face. His eyes were running approvingly over  her perfect figure, noting the straightness of the back, the fine poise  of the head, the shapeliness of the slender hands.    He pushed back his long black hair from his forehead and smiled. It  pleased him to believe that his face was cast in an intellectual mould,  and that the somewhat unhealthy pastiness of his skin might be described  as the \"pallor of thought.\"    Presently he looked away from her through the big bay window which  overlooked the crowded floor of Lyne's Stores.    He had had this office built in the entresol and the big windows had been  put in so that he might at any time overlook the most important  department which it was his good fortune to control.    Now and again, as he saw, a head would be turned in his direction, and he  knew that the attention of all the girls was concentrated upon the little  scene, plainly visible from the floor below, in which an unwilling  employee was engaged.    She, too, was conscious of the fact, and her discomfort and dismay  increased. She made a little movement as if to go, but he stopped her.    \"You don't understand, Odette,\" he said. His voice was soft and  melodious, and held the hint of a caress. \"Did you read my little book?\"  he asked suddenly.    She nodded.    \"Yes, I read--some of it,\" she said, and the colour deepened on her face.    He chuckled.    \"I suppose you thought it rather curious that a man in my position should  bother his head to write poetry, eh?\" he asked. \"Most of it was written  before I came into this beastly shop, my dear--before I developed into a  tradesman!\"    She made no reply, and he looked at her curiously.    \"What did you think of them?\" he asked.    Her lips were trembling, and again he mistook the symptoms.    \"I thought they were perfectly horrible,\" she said in a low voice.  \"Horrible!\"    He raised his eyebrows.    \"How very middle-class you are, Miss Rider!\" he scoffed. \"Those verses  have been acclaimed by some of the best critics in the country as  reproducing all the beauties of the old Hellenic poetry.\"    She went to speak, but stopped herself and stood with lips compressed.    Thornton Lyne shrugged his shoulders and strode to the other end of his  luxuriously equipped office.    \"Poetry, like cucumbers, is an acquired taste,\" he said after a while.  \"You have to be educated up to some kind of literature. I daresay there  will come a time when you will be grateful that I have given you an  opportunity of meeting beautiful thoughts dressed in beautiful language.\"    She looked up at this.    \"May I go now, Mr. Lyne?\" she asked.    \"Not yet,\" he replied coolly. \"You said just now you didn't understand  what I was talking about. I'll put it plainer this time. You're a very  beautiful girl, as you probably know, and you are destined, in all  probability, to be the mate of a very average suburban-minded person, who  will give you a life tantamount to slavery. That is the life of the  middle-class woman, as you probably know. And why would you submit to  this bondage? Simply because a person in a black coat and a white collar  has mumbled certain passages over you--passages which have neither  meaning nor, to an intelligent person, significance. I would not take  the trouble of going through such a foolish ceremony, but I would take a  great deal of trouble to make you happy.\"    He walked towards her slowly and laid one hand upon her shoulder.  Instinctively she shrank back and he laughed.    \"What do you say?\"    She swung round on him, her eyes blazing but her voice under control.    \"I happen to be one of those foolish, suburban-minded people,\" she said,  \"who give significance to those mumbled words you were speaking about.  Yet I am broad-minded enough to believe that the marriage ceremony would  not make you any happier or more unhappy whether it was performed or  omitted. But, whether it were marriage or any other kind of union, I  should at least require a man.\"    He frowned at her.    \"What do you mean?\" he asked, and the soft quality of his voice underwent  a change.    Her voice was full of angry tears when she answered him.    \"I should not want an erratic creature who puts horrid sentiments into  indifferent verse. I repeat, I should want a man.\"    His face went livid.    \"Do you know whom you are talking to?\" he asked, raising his voice.    \"I am talking to Thornton Lyne,\" said she, breathing quickly, \"the  proprietor of Lyne's Stores, the employer of Odette Rider who draws three  pounds every week from him.\"    He was breathless with anger.    \"Be careful!\" he gasped. \"Be careful!\"    \"I am speaking to a man whose whole life is a reproach to the very name  of man!\" she went on speaking rapidly. \"A man who is sincere in nothing,  who is living on the brains and reputation of his father, and the money  that has come through the hard work of better men.    \"You can't scare me,\" she cried scornfully, as he took a step towards  her. \"Oh, yes, I know I'm going to leave your employment, and I'm leaving  to-night!\"    The man was hurt, humiliated, almost crushed by her scorn. This she  suddenly realised and her quick woman's sympathy checked all further  bitterness.    \"I'm sorry I've been so unkind,\" she said in a more gentle tone. \"But you  rather provoked me, Mr. Lyne.\"    He was incapable of speech and could only shake his head and point with  unsteady finger to the door.    \"Get out,\" he whispered.    Odette Rider walked out of the room, but the man did not move. Presently,  however, he crossed to the window and, looking down upon the floor, saw  her trim figure move slowly through the crowd of customers and assistants  and mount the three steps which led to the chief cashier's office.    \"You shall pay for this, my girl!\" he muttered.    He was wounded beyond forgiveness. He was a rich man's son and had lived  in a sense a sheltered life. He had been denied the advantage which a  public school would have brought to him and had gone to college  surrounded by sycophants and poseurs as blatant as himself, and never  once had the cold breath of criticism been directed at him, except in  what he was wont to describe as the \"reptile Press.\"    He licked his dry lips, and, walking to his desk, pressed a bell. After a  short wait--for he had purposely sent his secretary away--a girl came in.    \"Has Mr. Tarling come?\" he asked.    \"Yes, sir, he's in the board-room. He has been waiting a quarter of an  hour.\"    He nodded.    \"Thank you,\" he said.    \"Shall I tell him----\"    \"I will go to him myself,\" said Lyne.    He took a cigarette out of his gold case, struck a match and lit it. His  nerves were shaken, his hands were trembling, but the storm in his heart  was soothing down under the influence of this great thought. Tarling!  What an inspiration! Tarling, with his reputation for ingenuity, his  almost sublime uncanny cleverness. What could be more wonderful than this  coincidence?    He passed with quick steps along the corridor which connected his private  den with the board-room, and came into that spacious apartment with  outstretched hand.    The man who turned to greet him may have been twenty-seven or  thirty-seven. He was tall, but lithe rather than broad. His face was the  colour of mahogany, and the blue eyes turned to Lyne were unwinking and  expressionless. That was the first impression which Lyne received.    He took Lyne's hand in his--it was as soft as a woman's. As they shook  hands Lyne noticed a third figure in the room. He was below middle height  and sat in the shadow thrown by a wall pillar. He too rose, but bowed his  head.    \"A Chinaman, eh?\" said Lyne, looking at this unexpected apparition with  curiosity. \"Oh, of course, Mr. Tarling, I had almost forgotten that  you've almost come straight from China. Won't you sit down?\"    He followed the other's example, threw himself into a chair and offered  his cigarette case.    \"The work I am going to ask"]]]
