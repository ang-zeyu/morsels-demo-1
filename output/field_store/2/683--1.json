In all history, there is no drama of more terrible interest than  that which terminated with the total destruction of Jerusalem. Had  the whole Jewish nation joined in the desperate resistance made, by  a section of it, to the overwhelming strength of Rome, the world  would have had no record of truer patriotism than that displayed,  by this small people, in their resistance to the forces of the  mistress of the world.    Unhappily, the reverse of this was the case. Except in the defense  of Jotapata and Gamala, it can scarcely be said that the Jewish  people, as a body, offered any serious resistance to the arms of  Rome. The defenders of Jerusalem were a mere fraction of its  population--a fraction composed almost entirely of turbulent  characters and robber bands, who fought with the fury of  desperation; after having placed themselves beyond the pale of  forgiveness, or mercy, by the deeds of unutterable cruelty with  which they had desolated the city, before its siege by the Romans.  They fought, it is true, with unflinching courage--a courage never  surpassed in history--but it was the courage of despair; and its  result was to bring destruction upon the whole population, as well  as upon themselves.    Fortunately the narrative of Josephus, an eyewitness of the events  which he describes, has come down to us; and it is the storehouse  from which all subsequent histories of the events have been drawn.  It is, no doubt, tinged throughout by his desire to stand well with  his patrons, Vespasian and Titus; but there is no reason to doubt  the accuracy of his descriptions. I have endeavored to present you  with as vivid a picture as possible of the events of the war,  without encumbering the story with details and, except as regards  the exploits of John of Gamala, of whom Josephus says nothing, have  strictly followed, in every particular, the narrative of the  historian.    G. A. Henty.        Chapter 1: The Lake Of Tiberias.      \"Dreaming, John, as usual? I never saw such a boy. You are always  in extremes; either tiring yourself out, or lying half asleep.\"    \"I was not half asleep, mother. I was looking at the lake.\"    \"I cannot see much to look at, John. It's just as it has been ever  since you were born, or since I was born.\"    \"No, I suppose there's no change, mother; but I am never tired of  looking at the sun shining on the ripples, and the fishermen's  boats, and the birds standing in the shallows or flying off, in a  desperate hurry, without any reason that I can make out. Besides,  mother, when one is looking at the lake, one is thinking of other  things.\"    \"And very often thinking of nothing at all, my son.\"    \"Perhaps so, mother; but there's plenty to think of, in these  times.\"    \"Plenty, John; there are baskets and baskets of figs to be stripped  from the trees, and hung up to dry for the winter and, next week,  we are going to begin the grape harvest. But the figs are the  principal matter, at present; and I think that it would be far more  useful for you to go and help old Isaac and his son, in getting  them in, than in lying there watching the lake.\"    \"I suppose it would, mother,\" the lad said, rising briskly; for his  fits of indolence were by no means common and, as a rule, he was  ready to assist at any work which might be going on.    \"I do not wonder at John loving the lake,\" his mother said to  herself, when the lad had hurried away. \"It is a fair scene; and it  may be, as Simon thinks, that a change may come over it, before  long, and that ruin and desolation may fall upon us all.\"    There were, indeed, few scenes which could surpass in tranquil  beauty that which Martha, the wife of Simon, was looking upon--the  sheet of sparkling water, with its low shores dotted with towns and  villages. Down the lake, on the opposite shore, rose the walls and  citadel of Tiberias, with many stately buildings; for although  Tiberias was not, now, the chief town of Galilee--for Sepphoris had  usurped its place--it had been the seat of the Roman authority, and  the kings who ruled the country for Rome generally dwelt there.  Half a mile from the spot where Martha was standing rose the  newly-erected walls of Hippos.    Where the towns and villages did not engross the shore, the rich  orchards and vineyards extended down to the very edge of the water.  The plain of Galilee was a veritable garden. Here flourished, in  the greatest abundance, the vine and the fig; while the low hills  were covered with olive groves, and the corn waved thickly on the  rich, fat land. No region on the earth's face possessed a fairer  climate. The heat was never extreme; the winds blowing from the  Great Sea brought the needed moisture for the vegetation; and so  soft and equable was the air that, for ten months in the year,  grapes and figs could be gathered.    The population, supported by the abundant fruits of the earth, was  very large. Villages--which would elsewhere be called towns, for  those containing but a few thousand inhabitants were regarded as  small, indeed--were scattered thickly over the plain; and few areas  of equal dimensions could show a population approaching that which  inhabited the plains and slopes between the Sea of Galilee and the  Mediterranean. None could then have dreamed of the dangers that  were to come, or believed that this rich cultivation and teeming  population would disappear; and that, in time, a few flocks of  wandering sheep would scarce be able to find herbage growing, on  the wastes of land which would take the place of this fertile soil.    Certainly no such thought as this occurred to Martha, as she  re-entered the house; though she did fear that trouble, and ruin,  might be approaching.    John was soon at work among the fig trees, aiding Isaac and his son  Reuben--a lad of some fifteen years--to pick the soft, luscious  fruit, and carry it to the little courtyard, shaded from the rays  of the sun by an overhead trellis work, covered with vines and  almost bending beneath the purple bunches of grapes. Miriam--the  old nurse--and four or five maid servants, under the eye of Martha,  tied them in rows on strings, and fastened them to pegs driven into  that side of the house upon which the sun beat down most hotly. It  was only the best fruit that was so served; for that which had been  damaged in the picking, and all of smaller size, were laid on trays  in the sun. The girls chatted merrily as they worked; for Martha,  although a good housewife, was a gentle mistress and, so long as  fingers were busy, heeded not if the tongue ran on.    \"Let the damsels be happy, while they may,\" she would say, if  Miriam scolded a little when the laughter rose louder than usual.  \"Let them be happy, while they can; who knows what lies in the  future?\"    But at present, the future cast no shade upon the group; nor upon a  girl of about fourteen years old, who danced in and out of the  courtyard in the highest spirits, now stopping a few minutes to  string the figs, then scampering away with an empty basket which,  when she reached the gatherers, she placed on her head and  supported demurely, for a little while, at the foot of the ladder  upon which John was perched--so that he could lay the figs in it  without bruising them. But, long ere the basket was filled she  would tire of the work and, setting it on the ground, run back into  the house.    \"And so you think you are helping, Mary,\" John said, laughing, when  the girl returned for the fourth time, with an empty basket.    \"Helping, John! Of course I am--ever so much. Helping you, and  helping them at the house, and carrying empty baskets. I consider  myself the most active of the party.\"    \"Active, certainly, Mary! but if you do not help them, in stringing  and hanging the figs, more than you help me, I think you might as  well leave it alone.\"    \"Fie, John! That is most ungrateful, after my standing here like a  statue, with the basket on my head, ready for you to lay the figs  in.\"    \"That is all very fine!\" John laughed; \"but before the basket is  half full, away you go; and I have to get down the ladder, and  bring up the basket and fix it firmly, and that without shaking the  figs; whereas, had you left it alone, altogether, I could have  brought up the empty basket and fixed it close by my hand, without  any trouble at all.\"    \"You are an ungrateful boy, and you know how bad it is to be  ungrateful! And after my making myself so hot, too!\" Miriam said.  \"My face is as red as fire, and that is all the thanks I get. Very  well, then, I shall go into the house, and leave you to your own  bad reflections.\"    \"You need not do that, Mary. You can sit down in the shade there,  and watch us at work; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21615"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 1 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                    CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE.

This is the first collected edition of a series of works which have  separately attained to a great popularity: volumes that have been always  delightful to the young and ardent inquirer after knowledge. They offer  as a whole a diversified miscellany of literary, artistic, and political  history, of critical disquisition and biographic anecdote, such as it is  believed cannot be elsewhere found gathered together in a form so  agreeable and so attainable. To this edition is appended a Life of the  Author by his son, also original notes, which serve to illustrate or to  correct the text, where more recent discoveries have brought to light  facts unknown when these volumes were originally published.                                                        LONDON, 1881.             *       *       *       *       *      ON THE    LIFE AND WRITINGS OF MR. DISRAELI.    BY HIS SON.      The traditionary notion that the life of a man of letters is necessarily  deficient in incident, appears to have originated in a misconception of  the essential nature of human action. The life of every man is full of  incidents, but the incidents are insignificant, because they do not  affect his species; and in general the importance of every occurrence is  to be measured by the degree with which it is recognised by mankind. An  author may influence the fortunes of the world to as great an extent as  a statesman or a warrior; and the deeds and performances by which this  influence is created and exercised, may rank in their interest and  importance with the decisions of great Congresses, or the skilful valour  of a memorable field. M. de Voltaire was certainly a greater Frenchman  than Cardinal Fleury, the Prime Minister of France in his time. His  actions were more important; and it is certainly not too much to  maintain that the exploits of Homer, Aristotle, Dante, or my Lord Bacon,  were as considerable events as anything that occurred at Actium,  Lepanto, or Blenheim. A Book may be as great a thing as a battle, and  there are systems of philosophy that have produced as great revolutions  as any that have disturbed even the social and political existence of  our centuries.    The life of the author, whose character and career we are venturing to  review, extended far beyond the allotted term of man: and, perhaps, no  existence of equal duration ever exhibited an uniformity more sustained.  The strong bent of his infancy was pursued through youth, matured in  manhood, and maintained without decay to an advanced old age. In the  biographic spell, no ingredient is more magical than predisposition. How  pure, and native, and indigenous it was in the character of this writer,  can only be properly appreciated by an acquaintance with the  circumstances amid which he was born, and by being able to estimate how  far they could have directed or developed his earliest inclinations.    My grandfather, who became an English Denizen in 1748, was an Italian  descendant from one of those Hebrew families whom the Inquisition forced  to emigrate from the Spanish Peninsula at the end of the fifteenth  century, and who found a refuge in the more tolerant territories of the  Venetian Republic. His ancestors had dropped their Gothic surname on  their settlement in the Terra Firma, and grateful to the God of Jacob  who had sustained them through unprecedented trials and guarded them  through unheard-of perils, they assumed the name of DISRAELI, a name  never borne before or since by any other family, in order that their  race might be for ever recognised. Undisturbed and unmolested, they  flourished as merchants for more than two centuries under the protection  of the lion of St. Mark, which was but just, as the patron saint of the  Republic was himself a child of Israel. But towards the middle of the  eighteenth century, the altered circumstances of England, favourable, as  it was then supposed, to commerce and religious liberty, attracted the  attention of my great-grandfather to this island, and he resolved that  the youngest of his two sons, Benjamin, the \"son of his right hand,\"  should settle in a country where the dynasty seemed at length  established, through the recent failure of Prince Charles Edward, and  where public opinion appeared definitively adverse to persecution on  matters of creed and conscience.    The Jewish families who were then settled in England were few, though,  from their wealth and other circumstances, they were far from  unimportant. They were all of them Sephardim, that is to say, children  of Israel, who had never quitted the shores of the Midland Ocean, until  Torquamada had driven them from their pleasant residences and rich  estates in Arragon, and Andalusia, and Portugal, to seek greater  blessings, even than a clear atmosphere and a glowing sun, amid the  marshes of Holland and the fogs of Britain. Most of these families, who  held themselves aloof from the Hebrews of Northern Europe, then only  occasionally stealing into England, as from an inferior caste, and whose  synagogue was reserved only for Sephardim, are now extinct; while the  branch of the great family, which, notwithstanding their own sufferings  from prejudice, they had the hardihood to look down upon, have achieved  an amount of wealth and consideration which the Sephardim, even with the  patronage of Mr. Pelham, never could have contemplated. Nevertheless, at  the time when my grandfather settled in England, and when Mr. Pelham,  who was very favourable to the Jews, was Prime Minister, there might be  found, among other Jewish families flourishing in this country, the  Villa Reals, who brought wealth to these shores almost as great as their  name, though that is the second in Portugal, and who have twice allied  themselves with the English aristocracy, the Medinas--the Laras, who  were our kinsmen--and the Mendez da Costas, who, I believe, still exist.    Whether it were that my grandfather, on his arrival, was not encouraged  by those to whom he had a right to look up,--which is often our hard  case in the outset of life,--or whether he was alarmed at the unexpected  consequences of Mr. Pelham's favourable disposition to his countrymen  in the disgraceful repeal of the Jew Bill, which occurred a very few  years after his arrival in this country, I know not; but certainly he  appears never to have cordially or intimately mixed with his community.  This tendency to alienation was, no doubt, subsequently encouraged by  his marriage, which took place in 1765. My grandmother, the beautiful  daughter of a family who had suffered much from persecution, had imbibed  that dislike for her race which the vain are too apt to adopt when they  find that they are born to public contempt. The indignant feeling that  should be reserved for the persecutor, in the mortification of their  disturbed sensibility, is too often visited on the victim; and the cause  of annoyance is recognised not in the ignorant malevolence of the  powerful, but in the conscientious conviction of the innocent sufferer.  Seventeen years, however, elapsed before my grandfather entered into  this union, and during that interval he had not been idle. He was only  eighteen when he commenced his career, and when a great responsibility  devolved upon him. He was not unequal to it. He was a man of ardent  character; sanguine, courageous, speculative, and fortunate; with a  temper which no disappointment could disturb, and a brain, amid  reverses, full of resource. He made his fortune in the midway of life,  and settled near Enfield, where he formed an Italian garden, entertained  his friends, played whist with Sir Horace Mann, who was his great  acquaintance, and who had known his brother at Venice as a banker, eat  macaroni which was dressed by the Venetian Consul, sang canzonettas, and  notwithstanding a wife who never pardoned him for his name, and a son  who disappointed all his plans, and who to the last hour of his life was  an enigma to him, lived till he was nearly ninety, and then died in  1817, in the full enjoyment of prolonged existence.    My grandfather retired from active business on the eve of that great  financial epoch, to grapple with which his talents were well adapted;  and when the wars and loans of the Revolution were about to create those  families of millionaires, in which he might probably have enrolled his  own. That, however, was not our destiny. My grandfather had only one  child, and nature had disqualified him, from his cradle, for the busy  pursuits of men.    A pale, pensive child, with large dark brown eyes, and flowing hair,  such as may be beheld in one of the portraits annexed to these volumes,  had grown up beneath this roof of worldly energy and enjoyment,  indicating even in his infancy, by the whole carriage of his life, that  he was of a different order from those among whom he lived. Timid,  susceptible, lost in reverie, fond of solitude, or seeking no better  company than a book, the years had stolen on, till he had arrived at  that mournful period of boyhood when eccentricities excite"]]]
