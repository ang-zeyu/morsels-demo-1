Once the Iroquois  were great people. Their council fires burn from Hudson on east to Lake  Erie on west, from rising to setting sun. Then White man come. He ask  for small seat size buffalo skin. He take larger and larger one, till  Indian have but small place to sit.    Now we have little left but stories of our fathers. They, too, will soon  be lost and forgotten, but a voice has come to speak for us. _Yeh sen  noh wehs_--the one who tells the stories--will carry these stories of  our fathers to Paleface. She will help White man to understand Indian,  Indian to be understood. She will have all men brothers.    Indian's heart is glad that _Yeh sen noh wehs_, our white friend, has  come to us. She have good eyes. She see right. She like things Indian.  She try to preserve them. Our old men and women tell her the stories  told them, many, many moons ago, when little children.    _Yeh sen noh wehs_ write down these stories so our children and our  children's children may read and know them; and so Paleface Children may  learn them also. Indian tell these stories to his children to make them  good and brave and kind and unselfish. May they teach Paleface Children  how they should do.    Again we say, Indian is glad to have some one speak for him. He is glad  to have some one write down the great and beautiful thoughts in Indian's  mind and heart. We have spoken. _Na ho._    Chief of Seneca Nation,    [Illustration: handwritten signature]    Chief of Onondagas,    [Illustration: handwritten signature]    Chief of Tuscaroras,    [Illustration: handwritten signature]    Chief of Oneidas,    [Illustration: handwritten signature]    Chief of Cayugas,    [Illustration: handwritten signature]    Chief of Mohawks,    [Illustration: handwritten signature]          HOW THE STORIES CAME TO BE      Out of the moons of long ago, these stories have come. Then every tribe  of the Iroquois had its story-teller.    When the Old Man of the North came out of his lodge, and the forests and  rivers of the Red Children grew white with his breath, these  story-tellers wandered from wigwam to wigwam.    Seated on warm skins by the fire, the story-teller would exclaim,  \"_Hanio_!\" This meant, \"Come, gather round, and I will tell a story.\"    Then all the Red Children would cry, \"_Heh_,\" and draw close to the  fire. This meant that they were glad to hear the story. And as the  flames leaped and chased one another along the fire trail, they would  listen to these wonder stories of the Little People, of the trees and  flowers, of birds, of animals, and men. When the story-teller had  finished, he said, \"_Na ho_.\" This meant, \"It is the end.\"    The earth was very young, when the Red Children first learned how  everything came to be, and just why it is that things are as they are.  They told these wonderful things to their children, and their children  in turn told them to their children; and those children again in turn  told them to theirs, that these things might not be forgotten.    Now, but few of the Red Children know these stories that the  grandmothers and old men of the tribe used to tell. The story-teller is  no longer seen wandering from wigwam to wigwam.    [Illustration]          WHY I WAS CALLED THE STORY-TELLER      Some time ago the writer of these stories was asked to speak for an  Indian Society. She accepted the invitation, and that night made her  first Indian friends.    Her new friends told her many beautiful things about the Red Children.  The more the writer learned about the Iroquois people, and things  Indian, the more interested she became. After a time she began to tell  the Paleface the things she had learned.    Soon, one of the tribes, the Senecas--the tribe to which her new friends  belonged--heard that she was speaking for them. They wished to honor  her, so they asked her to be present at their Green-Corn Feast, and  become one of them.    So when the Green-Corn moon hung her horn in the night sky, the writer  found the trail to the Land of the Senecas.

By ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.          I.--The Adventure of the Empty House.      IT was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested,  and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable  Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. The  public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out  in the police investigation; but a good deal was suppressed upon that  occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly  strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only  now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those  missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The  crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to  me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest  shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. Even now,  after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think of it, and  feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity  which utterly submerged my mind. Let me say to that public which has  shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given  them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they  are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I  should have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been  barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only  withdrawn upon the third of last month.    It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had  interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never  failed to read with care the various problems which came before  the public, and I even attempted more than once for my own private  satisfaction to employ his methods in their solution, though with  indifferent success. There was none, however, which appealed to me like  this tragedy of Ronald Adair. As I read the evidence at the inquest,  which led up to a verdict of wilful murder against some person or  persons unknown, I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss  which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. There  were points about this strange business which would, I was sure, have  specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have been  supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation  and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe. All day as  I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind, and found no  explanation which appeared to me to be adequate. At the risk of telling  a twice-told tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to  the public at the conclusion of the inquest.    The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth,  at that time Governor of one of the Australian Colonies. Adair's mother  had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and  she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at  427, Park Lane. The youth moved in the best society, had, so far as was  known, no enemies, and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss  Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by  mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had  left any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest the man's life  moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and  his nature unemotional. Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat  that death came in most strange and unexpected form between the hours of  ten and eleven-twenty on the night of March 30, 1894.    Ronald Adair was fond of cards, playing continually, but never for such  stakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish,  and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that after dinner on the day  of his death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. He had  also played there in the afternoon. The evidence of those who had played  with him--Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran--showed that  the game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.  Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. His fortune was a  considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect him. He  had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious  player, and usually rose a winner. It came out in evidence that in  partnership with Colonel Moran he had actually won as much as four  hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey  Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for his recent history, as it came out  at the inquest.    On the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at ten.  His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation. The  servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second  floor, generally used as his sitting-room. She had lit a fire there, and  as it smoked she had opened the window. No sound was heard from the room  until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her  daughter. Desiring to say good-night, she had attempted to enter her  son's room. The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be  got to their cries and knocking. Help was obtained and the door forced.  The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. His head had  been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but no weapon  of any sort was to be found in the room. On the table lay two bank-notes  for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the  money arranged in little piles of varying amount. There were some  figures also upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club friends  opposite to them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he  was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards.    A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case  more complex. In the first place, no reason could be given why the  young man should have fastened the door upon the inside. There was the  possibility that the murderer had done this and had afterwards escaped  by the window. The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of  crocuses in full bloom lay beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth  showed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks  upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road.  Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the  door. But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to  the window without leaving traces. Suppose a man had fired through the  window, it would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a  revolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again, Park Lane is a frequented  thoroughfare, and there is a cab-stand within a hundred yards of the  house. No one had heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man, and  there the revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed  bullets will, and so inflicted a wound which must have caused  instantaneous death. Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane  Mystery, which were further complicated by entire absence of motive,  since, as I have said, young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and  no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room.    All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon  some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line  of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the  starting-point of every investigation. I confess that I made little  progress. In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself  about six o'clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane. A group of  loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window,  directed me to the house which I had come to see. A tall, thin man with  coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes  detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others  crowded round to listen to what he said. I got as near him as I could,  but his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in  some disgust. As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man,  who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was  carrying. I remember that as I picked them up I observed the title of  one of them, \"The Origin of Tree Worship,\" and it struck me that the  fellow must be some poor bibliophile who, either as a trade or as a  hobby, was a collector of obscure volumes. I endeavoured to apologize  for the accident, but it was evident that these books which I had so  unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their  owner. With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his  curved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng.    My observations of No. 427, Park Lane did little to clear up the problem  in which I was interested. The house was separated from the street by  a low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high. It was"]]]
