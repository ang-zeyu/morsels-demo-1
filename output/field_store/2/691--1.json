THE BACKWOODS SETTLEMENT--CRUSOE'S PARENTAGE AND EARLY HISTORY--THE  AGONISING PAINS AND SORROWS OF HIS PUPPYHOOD, AND OTHER INTERESTING  MATTERS.    The dog Crusoe was once a pup.  Now do not, courteous reader, toss your  head contemptuously, and exclaim, \"Of course he was; I could have told  _you_ that.\"  You know very well that you have often seen a man above  six feet high, broad and powerful as a lion, with a bronzed shaggy  visage and the stern glance of an eagle, of whom you have said, or  thought, or heard others say, \"It is scarcely possible to believe that  such a man was once a squalling baby.\"  If you had seen our hero in all  the strength and majesty of full-grown doghood, you would have  experienced a vague sort of surprise had we told you--as we now repeat--  that the dog Crusoe was once a pup--a soft, round, sprawling, squeaking  pup, as fat as a tallow candle, and as blind as a bat.    But we draw particular attention to the fact of Crusoe's having once  been a pup, because in connection with the days of his puppyhood there  hangs a tale.  This peculiar dog may thus be said to have had two  tails--one in connection with his body, the other with his career.  This  tale, though short, is very harrowing, and, as it is intimately  connected with Crusoe's subsequent history, we will relate it here.  But  before doing so we must beg our reader to accompany us beyond the  civilised portions of the United States of America--beyond the frontier  settlements of the \"far west,\" into those wild prairies which are  watered by the great Missouri river--the Father of Waters--and his  numerous tributaries.    Here dwell the Pawnees, the Sioux, the Delawares, the Crows, the  Blackfeet, and many other tribes of Red Indians, who are gradually  retreating step by step towards the Rocky Mountains as the advancing  white man cuts down their trees and ploughs up their prairies.  Here,  too, dwell the wild horse and the wild ass, the deer, the buffalo, and  the badger; all, men and brutes alike, wild as the power of untamed and  ungovernable passion can make them, and free as the wind that sweeps  over their mighty plains.    There is a romantic and exquisitely beautiful spot on the banks of one  of the tributaries above referred to--a long stretch of mingled woodland  and meadow, with a magnificent lake lying like a gem in its green  bosom--which goes by the name of the Mustang Valley.  This remote vale,  even at the present day, is but thinly peopled by white men, and is  still a frontier settlement round which the wolf and the bear prowl  curiously, and from which the startled deer bounds terrified away.  At  the period of which we write the valley had just been taken possession  of by several families of squatters, who, tired of the turmoil and the  squabbles of the then frontier settlements, had pushed boldly into the  far west to seek a new home for themselves, where they could have \"elbow  room,\" regardless alike of the dangers they might encounter in unknown  lands and of the Red-skins who dwelt there.    The squatters were well armed with axes, rifles, and ammunition.  Most  of the women were used to dangers and alarms, and placed implicit  reliance in the power of their fathers, husbands, and brothers to  protect them--and well they might, for a bolder set of stalwart men than  these backwoodsmen never trod the wilderness.  Each had been trained to  the use of the rifle and the axe from infancy, and many of them had  spent so much of their lives in the woods, that they were more than a  match for the Indian in his own peculiar pursuits of hunting and war.  When the squatters first issued from the woods bordering the valley, an  immense herd of wild horses or mustangs were browsing on the plain.  These no sooner beheld the cavalcade of white men, than, uttering a wild  neigh, they tossed their flowing manes in the breeze and dashed away  like a whirlwind.  This incident procured the valley its name.    The newcomers gave one satisfied glance at their future home, and then  set to work to erect log huts forthwith.  Soon the axe was heard ringing  through the forests, and tree after tree fell to the ground, while the  occasional sharp ring of a rifle told that the hunters were catering  successfully for the camp.  In course of time the Mustang Valley began  to assume the aspect of a thriving settlement, with cottages and waving  fields clustered together in the midst of it.    Of course the savages soon found it out, and paid it occasional visits.  These dark-skinned tenants of the woods brought furs of wild animals  with them, which they exchanged with the white men for knives, and  beads, and baubles and trinkets of brass and tin.  But they hated the  \"Pale-faces\" with bitter hatred, because their encroachments had at this  time materially curtailed the extent of their hunting grounds, and  nothing but the numbers and known courage of the squatters prevented  these savages from butchering and scalping them all.    The leader of this band of pioneers was a Major Hope, a gentleman whose  love for nature in its wildest aspects determined him to exchange  barrack life for a life in the woods.  The major was a first-rate shot,  a bold, fearless man, and an enthusiastic naturalist.  He was past the  prime of life, and, being a bachelor, was unencumbered with a family.  His first act on reaching the site of the new settlement was to commence  the erection of a block-house, to which the people might retire in case  of a general attack by the Indians.    In this block-house Major Hope took up his abode as the guardian of the  settlement,--and here the dog Crusoe was born; here he sprawled in the  early morn of life; here he leaped, and yelped, and wagged his shaggy  tail in the excessive glee of puppyhood, and from the wooden portals of  this block-house he bounded forth to the chase in all the fire, and  strength, and majesty of full-grown doghood.    Crusoe's father and mother were magnificent Newfoundlanders.  There was  no doubt as to their being of the genuine breed, for Major Hope had  received them as a parting gift from a brother officer, who had brought  them both from Newfoundland itself.  The father's name was Crusoe; the  mother's name was Fan.  Why the father had been so called no one could  tell.  The man from whom Major Hope's friend had obtained the pair was a  poor, illiterate fisherman, who had never heard of the celebrated  \"Robinson\" in all his life.  All he knew was that Fan had been named  after his own wife.  As for Crusoe, he had got him from a friend, who  had got him from another friend, whose cousin had received him as a  marriage gift from a friend of _his_; and that each had said to the  other that the dog's name was \"Crusoe,\" without reasons being asked or  given on either side.  On arriving at New York the major's friend, as we  have said, made him a present of the dogs.  Not being much of a dog  fancier, he soon tired of old Crusoe, and gave him away to a gentleman,  who took him down to Florida, and that was the end of him.  He was never  heard of more.    When Crusoe, junior, was born, he was born, of course, without a name.  That was given to him afterwards in honour of his father.  He was also  born in company with a brother and two sisters, all of whom drowned  themselves accidentally, in the first month of their existence, by  falling into the river which flowed past the block-house,--a calamity  which occurred, doubtless, in consequence of their having gone out  without their mother's leave.  Little Crusoe was with his brother and  sisters at the time, and fell in along with them, but was saved from  sharing their fate by his mother, who, seeing what had happened, dashed  with an agonised howl into the water, and, seizing him in her mouth,  brought him ashore in a half-drowned condition.  She afterwards brought  the others ashore one by one, but the poor little things were dead.    And now we come to the harrowing part of our tale, for the proper  understanding of which the foregoing dissertation was needful.    One beautiful afternoon, in that charming season of the American year  called the Indian summer, there came a family of Sioux Indians to the  Mustang Valley, and pitched their tent close to the block-house.  A  young hunter stood leaning against the gate-post of the palisades,  watching the movements of the Indians, who, having just finished a long  \"palaver\" or \"talk\" with Major Hope, were now in the act of preparing  supper.  A fire had been kindled on the green sward in front of the  tent, and above it stood a tripod, from which depended a large tin  camp-kettle.  Over this hung an ill-favoured Indian woman, or squaw,  who, besides attending to the contents of the pot, bestowed sundry cuffs  and kicks upon her little child, which sat near to her playing with  several Indian curs that gambolled round the fire.  The master of the  family and his two sons reclined on buffalo robes, smoking their stone  pipes or calumets in silence.  There was nothing peculiar in their  appearance.  Their faces were neither dignified nor coarse in  expression, but wore an aspect of stupid apathy, which formed a striking  contrast to the countenance of the young hunter, who seemed an amused  spectator of their proceedings.    The youth referred to was very unlike, in many respects, to what we are  accustomed to suppose a backwoods hunter should be.  He did not possess  that quiet gravity and staid demeanour which often characterise these  men.  True, he was tall and strongly made, but no one would have called  him stalwart, and his frame indicated grace and agility rather than  strength.  But the point about him which rendered him different from his  companions was his bounding, irrepressible flow of spirits, strangely  coupled with an intense love of solitary wandering in the woods.

IN WHICH THE HUNTERS ARE INTRODUCED.    It was five o'clock in the afternoon.  There can be no doubt whatever as  to that.  Old Agnes may say what she pleases--she has a habit of doing  so--but I know for certain (because I looked at my watch not ten minutes  before it happened) that it was exactly five o'clock in the afternoon  when I received a most singular and every way remarkable visit--a visit  which has left an indelible impression on my memory, as well it might;  for, independent of its singularity and unexpectedness, one of its  results was the series of strange adventures which are faithfully  detailed in this volume.    It happened thus:--    I was seated in an armchair in my private study in a small town on the  west coast of England.  It was a splendid afternoon, and it was exactly  five o'clock.  Mark that.  Not that there is anything singular about the  mere fact, neither is it in any way mixed up with the thread of this  tale; but old Agnes is very obstinate--singularly positive--and I have a  special desire that she should see it in print, that I have not given in  on that point.  Yes, it was five precisely, and a beautiful evening.  I  was ruminating, as I frequently do, on the pleasant memories of bygone  days, especially the happy days that I spent long ago among the coral  islands of the Pacific, when a tap at the door aroused me.    \"Come in.\"    \"A veesiter, sir,\" said old Agnes (my landlady), \"an' he'll no gie his  name.\"    Old Agnes, I may remark, is a Scotchwoman.    \"Show him in,\" said I.    \"Maybe he's a pickpocket,\" suggested Agnes.    \"I'll take my chance of that.\"    \"Ay! that's like 'ee.  Cares for naethin'.  Losh, man, what if he cuts  yer throat?\"    \"I'll take my chance of that too; only _do_ show him in, my good woman,\"  said I, with a gesture of impatience that caused the excellent (though  obstinate) old creature to depart, grumbling.    In another moment a quick step was heard on the stair, and a stranger  burst into the room, shut the door in my landlady's face as she followed  him, and locked it.    I was naturally surprised, though not alarmed, by the abrupt and  eccentric conduct of my visitor, who did not condescend to take off his  hat, but stood with his arms folded on his breast, gazing at me and  breathing hard.    \"You are agitated, sir; pray be seated,\" said I, pointing to a chair.    The stranger, who was a little man and evidently a gentleman, made no  reply, but, seizing a chair, placed it exactly before me, sat down on it  as he would have seated himself on a horse, rested his arms on the back,  and stared me in the face.    \"You are disposed to be facetious,\" said I, smiling (for I never take  offence without excessively good reason).    \"Not at all, by no means,\" said he, taking off his hat and throwing it  recklessly on the floor.  \"You are Mr Rover, I presume?\"    \"The same, sir, at your service.\"    \"Are you? oh, that's yet to be seen!  Pray, is your Christian name  Ralph?\"    \"It is,\" said I, in some surprise at the coolness of my visitor.    \"Ah! just so.  Christian name Ralph, t'other name Rover--Ralph Rover.  Very good.  Age twenty-two yesterday, eh?\"    \"My birthday _was_ yesterday, and my age _is_ twenty-two.  You appear to  know more of my private history than I have the pleasure of knowing of  yours.  Pray, sir, may I--but, bless me! are you unwell?\"    I asked this in some alarm, because the little man was rolling about in  his seat, holding his sides, and growing very red in the face.    \"Oh no! not at all; perfectly well--never was better in my life,\" he  said, becoming all at once preternaturally grave.  \"You were once in the  Pacific--lived on a coral island--\"    \"I did.\"    \"Oh, don't trouble yourself to answer.  Just shut up for a minute or  two.  You were rather a soft green youth then, and you don't seem to be  much harder or less verdant now.\"    \"Sir!\"  I exclaimed, getting angry.    \"Just so,\" continued he, \"and you knew a young rascal there--\"    \"I know a rascal _here_,\" I exclaimed, starting up, \"whom I'll kick--\"    \"What!\" cried the little stranger, also starting up and capsizing the  chair; \"Ralph Rover, has time and sunburning and war so changed my  visage that you cannot recognise Peterkin?\"    I almost gasped for breath.    \"Peterkin--Peterkin Gay!\"  I exclaimed.    I am not prone to indulge in effeminate demonstration, but I am not  ashamed to confess that when I gazed on the weather-beaten though ruddy  countenance of my old companion, and observed the eager glance of his  bright blue eyes, I was quite overcome, and rushed violently into his  arms.  I may also add that until that day I had had no idea of  Peterkin's physical strength; for during the next five minutes he  twisted me about and spun me round and round my own room until my brain  began to reel, and I was fain to cry him mercy.    \"So, you're all right--the same jolly, young old wiseacre in whiskers  and long coat,\" cried Peterkin.  \"Come now, Ralph, sit down if you can.  I mean to stay with you all evening, and all night, and all to-morrow,  and all next day, so we'll have lots of time to fight our battles o'er  again.  Meanwhile compose yourself, and I'll tell you what I've come  about.  Of course, my first and chief reason was to see your face, old  boy; but I have another reason too--a very peculiar reason.  I've a  proposal to make and a plan to unfold, both of 'em stunners; they'll  shut you up and screw you down, and altogether flabbergast you when you  hear 'em, so sit down and keep quiet--do.\"    I sat down accordingly, and tried to compose myself; but, to say truth,  I was so much overjoyed and excited by the sight of my old friend and  companion that I had some difficulty at first in fixing my attention on  what he said, the more especially that he spoke with extreme volubility,  and interrupted his discourse very frequently, in order to ask questions  or to explain.    \"Now, old fellow,\" he began, \"here goes, and mind you don't interrupt  me.  Well, I mean to go, and I mean you to go with me, to--but, I  forgot, perhaps you won't be able to go.  What are you?\"    \"What am I?\"    \"Ay, your profession, your calling; lawyer, M.D., scrivener--which?\"    \"I am a naturalist.\"    \"A what?\"    \"A naturalist.\"    \"Ralph,\" said Peterkin slowly, \"have you been long troubled with that  complaint?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, laughing; \"I have suffered from it from my earliest  infancy, more or less.\"    \"I thought so,\" rejoined my companion, shaking his head gravely.  \"I  fancied that I observed the development of that disease when we lived  together on the coral island.  It don't bring you in many thousands a  year, does it?\"    \"No,\" said I, \"it does not.  I am only an amateur, having a sufficiency  of this world's goods to live on without working for my bread.  But  although my dear father at his death left me a small fortune, which  yields me three hundred a year, I do not feel entitled to lead the life  of an idler in this busy world, where so many are obliged to toil night  and day for the bare necessaries of life.  I have therefore taken to my  favourite studies as a sort of business, and flatter myself that I have  made one or two not unimportant discoveries, and added a few mites to  the sum of human knowledge.  A good deal of my time is spent in  scientific roving expeditions throughout the country, and in  contributing papers to several magazines.\"    While I was thus speaking I observed that Peterkin's face was undergoing  the most remarkable series of changes of expression, which, as I  concluded, merged into a smile of beaming delight, as he said,--\"Ralph,  you're a trump!\"    \"Possibly,\" said I, \"you are right; but, setting that question aside for  the present, let me remind you that you have not yet told me where you  mean to go to.\"    \"I mean,\" said Peterkin slowly, placing both hands on his knees and  looking me steadily in the face--\"I mean to go a-hunting in--but I  forgot.  You don't know that I'm a hunter, a somewhat famous hunter?\"    \"Of course I don't.  You are so full of your plans and proposals that  you have not yet told me where you have been or what doing these six  years.  And you ye never written to me once all that time, shabby  fellow.  I thought you were dead.\"    \"Did you go into mourning for me, Ralph?\"    \"No, of course not.\"    \"A pretty fellow you are to find fault.  You thought that I, your oldest  and best friend, was dead, and you did not go into mourning.  How could  I write to you when you parted from me without giving me your address?  It was a mere chance my finding you out even now.  I was taking a quiet  cup of coffee in the commercial room of a hotel not far distant, when I  overheard a stranger speaking of his friend `Ralph Rover, the  philosopher,' so I plunged at him promiscuously, and made him give me  your address.  But I've corresponded with Jack ever since we parted on  the pier at Dover.\"    \"What!  Jack--Jack Martin?\"  I exclaimed, as a warm gush of feeling  filled my heart at the sound of his well-remembered name.  \"Is Jack  alive?\"    \"Alive!  I should think so.  If possible, he's more alive than ever; for  I should suppose he must be full-grown now, which he was not when we  last met.  He and I have corresponded regularly.  He lives in the north  of England, and by good luck happens to be just now within thirty miles  of this town.  You don't mean to say, Ralph, that you have never met!\"    \"Never.  The very same mistake that happened with you occurred between  him and me.  We parted vowing to correspond as long as we should live,  and three hours after I remembered that we had neglected to exchange our  addresses, so that we could not correspond.  I have often, often made  inquiries both for you and him, but have always failed.  I never heard  of Jack from the time we parted at Dover till to-day.\"    \"Then no doubt you thought us both"]]]
