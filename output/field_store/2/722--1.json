Norwood Press  J.S. Cushing & Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.  Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.          PREFACE      The life of Theodore Roosevelt is one well worth studying by any  American boy who wishes to make something of himself and mount high on  the ladder of success.    The twenty-sixth President of our country is a fine type of the true  American of to-day, full of vim and vigor, quick to comprehend, and  equally quick to act, not afraid to defend his opinions against all  comers when satisfied that he is in the right, independent, and yet not  lacking in fine social qualities, physically and morally courageous, and  with a faith in himself and his God that is bound to make for good so  long as he clings to it.    Theodore Roosevelt comes from countless generations of fighting stock,  both in this country and abroad. And yet as a youth the future hero of  San Juan Hill was a delicate lad, and many fears were entertained that  he might not live to manhood. But life in the open air, with judicious  athletic exercise, accomplished wonders, and he became strong and hardy  to an astonishing degree.    The boyhood days of the future President were spent in New York City and  at the family's country home, Oyster Bay, Long Island. From there he  went to Harvard College, from which he graduated with high honors. Still  somewhat delicate in health, he travelled in Europe, studied for a short  time at Dresden, and took to climbing the Alps and other noted  mountains.    His mind had gravitated toward literature, and he was writing a naval  history of the War of 1812 when something prompted him to take up  politics, and almost before he knew it he was elected a New York State  assemblyman. He served in this capacity for three terms, and many are  the stories told of how he fought against corruption first, last, and  all the time.    The death of his first wife and of his beloved mother were at this time  a great blow to him, and leaving his one little daughter with relatives,  he struck out for the great West, where, in the Bad Lands, so called, he  located as ranchman and hunter, filling in his spare hours by studying  and by writing on various outdoor subjects, works which have become  decidedly popular, and which show well his gifts as an author and as an  observer of nature.    While still in great part a successful ranchman, he ran for mayor of New  York and was defeated. He now devoted himself with increased energy to  his literary labors until, soon after, he was appointed by President  Harrison a member of the Civil Service Commission. He served on this  commission with marked ability for six years, when he resigned to become  police commissioner of New York City.    Theodore Roosevelt's work as a police commissioner will not be readily  forgotten. The whole tone of the service was at once raised, and for the  first time in many years the metropolis had \"dry\" Sundays, when every  saloon in the city was tightly closed. This strict compliance with the  law made him some enemies, but to these he paid no heed, for he was  doing only his duty.    When William McKinley was nominated for the Presidency the first time,  Theodore Roosevelt was one of his most enthusiastic supporters. Upon the  election of McKinley, John D. Long was appointed Secretary of the Navy  and Theodore Roosevelt became the First Assistant Secretary. Ever since  writing his naval history the newly appointed assistant had made a close  study of naval matters, and now he applied himself with vigor to the  duties of his office; and it was primarily through his efforts that when  the war with Spain came, our war-ships and our coast defences were in  much better condition than they had been at any time previous in our  history.    With the outbreak of the war, Theodore Roosevelt resigned. \"My duty here  is done,\" he said. \"My place is in the field.\" And without loss of time  he and his intimate friend, Dr. Leonard Wood, began the organization of  that body of troops which was officially designated as the First United  States Volunteer Cavalry, but which speedily became known everywhere as  the Rough Riders,--a body as unique as the world has ever seen, being  made up of men from all over the Union, but principally from four  Territories, and including hunters, cowboys, soldiers of fortune,  foot-ball and base-ball champions, college graduates, ex-policemen, with  American, Irish, Dutch, German, Mexican, and Indian blood in their  veins,--truly a remarkable collection, but every man and officer strong  and hardy, full of courage, a good horseman, and a fine shot.    From the very start, the Rough Riders were anxious to get into the  fight, and the opportunity was not long in coming. From Florida the  command was transported to Daiquiri, on the southern coast of Cuba, and  then began the advance upon the city of Santiago, which brought on the  engagement at La Guasima, followed by the thrilling battle of San Juan  Hill, in which the Rough Riders distinguished themselves in a manner  that will never be forgotten. In the very thickest of this fight was  Colonel Roosevelt, urging his men forward to victory, regardless of the  shot and shell falling upon all sides. A hero truly, and such heroes are  not forgotten.    Upon the close of the war Theodore Roosevelt thought to retire to  private life, but this was not to be. Arriving at New York, he was  hailed with delight by thousands, and at the next election was made  governor of the Empire State. As governor he made friends in both of the  leading political parties by his straightforwardness and his sterling  honesty. Men might differ with him politically, but they could never  accuse him of doing that which he himself did not firmly believe was  right.    His term as governor had not yet expired when President McKinley was  nominated for a second term. Again the people at large clamored for  Roosevelt, and against his earnest protestations he was forced to accept  the nomination for the Vice-Presidency. He was elected, and at the  proper time took his seat as presiding officer of the Senate.    It was at this time a blow fell upon our nation from which we have  scarcely yet recovered. President McKinley was struck down by the  cowardly hand of an assassin. The Vice-President was at this time off on  one of his favorite outings, but with all possible speed he came back  and was sworn in as President. It was a great responsibility, and many  feared that great changes in our government might result. But the fears  proved groundless. Young as he was,--and he is the youngest of all of  our Presidents,--he took upon himself the duty of carrying out the  intentions of his predecessor, and proving to the world once again that,  even though a President die, \"the government at Washington still lives.\"    There is another side to the character of our President which must not  be overlooked. He is of strong religious convictions and a member of the  Dutch Reformed Church. It is seldom that he is given to preaching, but  when he does his words have a sincerity that proves much for the  foundation of his character. He stands for what is honest and upright in  political and private life, and although, being but human, he may make  mistakes, he remains a Chief Magistrate well deserving the highest  honors our nation can bestow.

Away they went  flying.--Page 131.]          To the Memory of    ALEXANDER AFANASIEF    I Dedicate this Book,    TO HIM SO DEEPLY INDEBTED.          PREFACE.      The stories contained in the following pages are taken from the  collections published by Afanasief, Khudyakof, Erlenvein, and  Chudinsky. The South-Russian collections of Kulish and Rudchenko I  have been able to use but little, there being no complete dictionary  available of the dialect, or rather the language, in which they are  written. Of these works that of Afanasief is by far the most  important, extending to nearly 3,000 pages, and containing 332  distinct stories--of many of which several variants are given,  sometimes as many as five. Khudyakof's collection contains 122  skazkas--as the Russian folk-tales are called--Erlenvein's 41, and  Chudinsky's 31. Afanasief has also published a separate volume,  containing 33 \"legends,\" and he has inserted a great number of stories  of various kinds in his \"Poetic views of the Old Slavonians about  Nature,\" a work to which I have had constant recourse.    From the stories contained in what may be called the \"chap-book  literature\" of Russia, I have made but few extracts. It may, however,  be as well to say a few words about them. There is a Russian word  _lub_, diminutive _lubok_, meaning the soft bark of the lime tree,  which at one time was used instead of paper. The popular tales which  were current in former days were at first printed on sheets or strips  of this substance, whence the term _lubochnuiya_ came to be given to  all such productions of the cheap press, even after paper had taken  the place of bark.[1]    The stories which have thus been preserved have no small interest of  their own, but they cannot be considered as fair illustrations of  Russian folk-lore, for their compilers in many cases took them from  any sources to which they had access, whether eastern or western,  merely adapting what they borrowed to Russian forms of thought and  speech. Through some such process, for instance, seem to have passed  the very popular Russian stories of Eruslan Lazarevich and of Bova  Korolevich. They have often been quoted as \"creations of the Slavonic  mind,\" but there seems to be no reason for doubting that they are  merely Russian adaptations, the first of the adventures of the Persian  Rustem, the second of those of the Italian Buovo di Antona, our Sir  Bevis of Hampton. The editors of these \"chap-book skazkas\" belonged to  the pre-scientific period, and had a purely commercial object in view.  Their stories were intended simply to sell.    A German version of seventeen of these \"chap-book tales,\" to which  was prefixed an introduction by Jacob Grimm, was published some forty  years ago,[2] and has been translated into English.[3] Somewhat later,  also, appeared a German version of twelve more of these tales.[4]    Of late years several articles have appeared in some of the German  periodicals,[5] giving accounts or translations of some of the Russian  Popular Tales. But no thorough investigation of them appeared in  print, out of Russia, until the publication last year of the erudite  work on \"Zoological Mythology\" by Professor Angelo de Gubernatis. In  it he has given a summary of the greater part of the stories contained  in the collections of Afanasief and Erlenvein, and so fully has he  described the part played in them by the members of the animal world  that I have omitted, in the present volume, the chapter I had prepared  on the Russian \"Beast-Epos.\"    Another chapter which I have, at least for a time, suppressed, is  that in which I had attempted to say something about the origin and  the meaning of the Russian folk-tales. The subject is so extensive  that it requires for its proper treatment more space than a single  chapter could grant; and therefore, though not without reluctance, I  have left the stories I have quoted to speak for themselves, except in  those instances in which I have given the chief parallels to be found  in the two collections of foreign folk-tales best known to the English  reader, together with a few others which happened to fall within the  range of my own reading. Professor de Gubernatis has discussed at  length, and with much learning, the esoteric meaning of the skazkas,  and their bearing upon the questions to which the \"solar theory\" of  myth-explanation has given rise. To his volumes, and to those of Mr.  Cox, I refer all who are interested in those fascinating enquiries. My  chief aim has been to familiarize English readers with the Russian  folk-tale; the historical and mythological problems involved in it can  be discussed at a later period. Before long, in all probability, a  copious flood of light will be poured upon the connexion of the  Popular Tales of Russia with those of other lands by one of those  scholars who are best qualified to deal with the subject.[6]    Besides the stories about animals, I have left unnoticed two other  groups of skazkas--those which relate to historical events, and those  in which figure the heroes of the Russian \"epic poems\" or \"metrical  romances.\" My next volume will be devoted to the Builinas, as those  poems are called, and in it the skazkas which are connected with them  will find their fitting place. In it, also, I hope to find space for  the discussion of many questions which in the present volume I have  been forced to leave unnoticed.    The fifty-one stories which I have translated at length I have  rendered as literally as possible. In the very rare instances in which  I have found it necessary to insert any words by way of explanation, I  have (except in the case of such additions as \"he said\" or the like)  enclosed them between brackets. In giving summaries, also, I have kept  closely to the text, and always translated literally the passages  marked as quotations. In the imitation of a finished work of art,  elaboration and polish are meet and due, but in a transcript from  nature what is most required is fidelity. An \"untouched\" photograph is  in certain cases infinitely preferable to one which has been carefully  \"worked upon.\" And it is, as it were, a photograph of the Russian  story-teller that I have tried to produce, and not an ideal portrait.           *       *       *       *       *    The following are the principal Russian books to which reference has  been made:--          AFANASIEF (A.N.).

Narodnuiya Yuzhnorusskiya Skazki        [South-Russian Popular Tales].[10] Kief, 1869.    Most of the other works referred to are too well known to require a  full setting out of their title. But it is necessary to explain that  references to Grimm are as a general rule to the \"Kinder- und  Hausmaerchen,\" 9th ed. Berlin, 1870. Those to Asbjoernsen and Moe are to  the \"Norske Folke-Eventyr,\" 3d ed. Christiania, 1866; those to  Asbjoernsen only are to the \"New Series\" of those tales, Christiania,  1871; those to Dasent are to the \"Popular Tales from the Norse,\" 2d  ed., 1859. The name \"Karajich\" refers to the \"Srpske Narodne  Pripovijetke,\" published at Vienna in 1853 by Vuk Stefanovich  Karajich, and translated by his daughter under the title of  \"Volksmaerchen der Serben,\" Berlin, 1854. By \"Schott\" is meant the  \"Walachische Maehrchen,\" Stuttgart und Tubingen, 1845, by \"Schleicher\"  the \"Litauische Maerchen,\" Weimar, 1857, by \"Hahn\" the \"Griechische und  albanesische Maerchen,\" Leipzig, 1864, by \"Haltrich\" the \"Deutsche  Volksmaerchen aus dem Sachsenlande in Siebenbuergen,\" Berlin, 1856, and  by \"Campbell\" the \"Popular Tales of the West Highlands,\" 4 vols.,  Edinburgh, 1860-62.    A few of the ghost stories contained in the following pages appeared  in the \"Cornhill Magazine\" for August 1872, and an account of some of  the \"legends\" was given in the \"Fortnightly Review\" for April 1, 1868.
