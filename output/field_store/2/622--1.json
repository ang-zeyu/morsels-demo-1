PREFACE    Where can you find a lad who does not treasure among his secrets the  nesting-place of some pair of birds?  Where can you find a child who  does not watch for the first robin of spring-time?  Where can you find  one who does not know when the wild ducks in the wedge-shaped flocks  fly southward?    This little book of \"Bird Stories\" is written both for the children who  already know our common birds, and for those who may know them if they  choose.    For those children who know, the book is a verification of their own  facts, with an addition of stories, poems, and songs to make facts  beautiful; for the children who do not know, the book is a simple set  of facts placed before them for verification and entertainment.    To all, may the knowledge obtained be a pleasure and a delight.    LENORE ELIZABETH MULETS.

The frost jewels sparkled on the snow.  The winds blew cutting cold from the north.    Phyllis, in her scarlet coat and cap, and long, warm leggings, waded in  the deepest drifts she could find.    Out by the garden fence was the greatest drift.  After floundering  through it, Phyllis climbed up and perched on the top rail of the fence.    She sat quite still, for she was almost breathless after her struggle  in the snow.    Suddenly, just over her head, Phyllis heard a whistle.  She started so  that she almost fell from the fence.    Again came the whistle, clear, sweet, and long drawn out.  Phyllis  looked up, and there on the branch of the elm-tree sat a cheery little  bird.    With a third whistle he flew down to the fence and perched beside  Phyllis.    He came quite close and stared at the little girl in a gay, curious  manner, as though he might be looking for a playfellow.    \"Who are you?\" asked Phyllis, looking like a great red bird as she  perched on the fence.    \"Chick-a-dee!  Chick-a-dee!  Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!\" twittered the little  fellow.  It seemed to Phyllis that he laughed because she did not know  him.    \"Oh, to be sure,\" said she.  \"How stupid of me not to remember.  I have  met you a hundred times.    \"I should have remembered your black head and throat.  The sides of  your head and neck are white.  Your breasts and sides are light yellow.  Your tail and wings are of a much darker shade, and how daintily they  are edged with white!\"    The chickadee fluttered about for a moment, and noticing the  friendliness in Phyllis's tones he perched a little closer to her side.    \"I do not believe you noticed the large white feathers in my  shoulders,\" he said.  \"You may always know a chickadee by the white  markings there.\"    \"I did not notice your white shoulders at first,\" said Phyllis, \"but I  saw at once what fine downy feathers you have.  They are beautifully  soft.  Do they make a warm winter dress?  How do you chance to be here  in the winter-time?    \"I think it is time you were in the South, Mr. Chickadee!  Did your  family leave you behind?\"    \"No, indeed,\" replied Mr. Chickadee.  \"No, indeed, Phyllis!  My entire  family are wintering here in the North.  We never go South for the  winter.    \"We are quite happy to remain here at home, and to come out on sunshiny  days and whistle and sing and be happy.    \"Only half an hour ago some boys went coasting down that hill.  I  whistled at them but they did not hear me.    \"Soon they came up the hill, drawing their sleds behind them.  I  whistled again and called my name.    \"'Why, hello,' cried a boy in a blue reefer and a blue stocking cap.  'Hello, chickadee, you're a jolly little fellow!  We call you our fair  weather friend because you sing so cheerily on these clear frosty days.'    \"'Oho!' laughed another boy, who had a big scratch on his nose, 'I saw  a chickadee flying about among the fir-trees on that very stormy day  last week.  He sang just as cheerily through the storm.'  Then the boy  whistled back to me and called my name.\"    \"That was my brother Jack,\" laughed Phyllis.  \"He got that scratch  while out coasting.  He told me that he saw you on that stormy day.  He  loves the winter quite as well as you do.  You should hear him sing and  whistle when the snow falls for coasting.  You should hear him shout  when the cold skating days come.  He says that Jack Frost is a fellow's  best friend.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the jolly little chickadee, blinking his eyes in a funny  way, \"my brothers say the very same thing!\"    \"But how do you find anything to eat in the winter-time?\" Phyllis  asked.  \"The insects and worms have long been dead.  What did you have  for breakfast this morning?\"    \"We had eggs and--\"    \"Eggs?\" cried Phyllis, not waiting for the bird to finish.  \"You had  eggs?\"    \"Yes, moth's eggs,\" said the bird.  \"The moths leave their eggs about  in all sorts of places.  We chickadees know where to find them!\"    \"Are they--good?\" asked Phyllis.    \"Delicious!\" replied the chickadee.  \"I think I have eaten more than a  million insects' eggs in my life.  I shall never tire of them.\"    \"Where do you sleep?\" Phyllis asked.    \"In the fir-trees, to be sure,\" was the reply.  \"It is quite warm in  there, among the many branches, and as soon as we waken we can get our  breakfasts.  There are all sorts of eggs and sleeping insects among the  fir branches.\"    Phyllis looked from her own thick red leggings to the chickadee's light  blue legs.    \"Don't your feet get very cold?\" she asked.  \"You surely need some  leggings.\"    The chickadee chirruped and twittered and fluttered until Phyllis  suddenly saw that he was laughing at her.    \"I don't know what cold feet are!\" he said.  \"I'm glad no one gave me  red leggings for Christmas.\"    \"What did you get for Christmas?\"    \"A wonderfully fine dinner spread on a white snow table-cloth under the  cherry-tree!\" replied the bird.    \"Oh, did you come to my bird feast?\" cried the little girl.  \"I spread  crumbs and bird seed for you.  Jack wanted to hang a meat bone in the  cedar-tree.  He said that you would like it better.  Indeed, I believe  he did hang one there.  Did you ever see it?\"    \"Oh, yes, Phyllis, many a day have we pecked away at that meat bone.  It was really very good.\"    \"Jack read in a book that you were fond of pecking at meat bones.  He  will be glad to know that it is true!\"    \"Thank him for us,\" said the chickadee.  \"You were kind to remember us!\"    \"Ah,\" said Phyllis, \"but it was kind of you to remain behind to cheer  us when all the other birds have gone to warmer lands.    \"But, chickadee, though you are so cheery and gay in winter, are you  not really happier in the summer-time?\"    \"Oh, we are so busy in summer,\" the chickadee replied.  \"Last May I  travelled miles and miles looking for a vacant house.\"    \"Looking for a vacant house?\" cried Phyllis, with wide brown eyes.    \"For housekeeping,\" said the chickadee.  \"You see my mate and I had  never kept house before.  She was very anxious to find a most suitable  place.    \"My wife said a woodpecker's nest was the very place, but I rather  preferred a squirrel's hole.    \"For a long time we could find neither to suit us.  But at length I  heard Mrs. Chickadee calling loudly.  I flew to her side at once.    \"'What is it?' I cried.    \"'Look!' cried Mrs. Chickadee, pointing with her bill and flapping her  wings with joy.    \"Through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net  (This book was produced from scanned images of public  domain material from the Google Print project.)

This collection contains translations of Roumanian tales which,  however, comprise but a small portion of the inexhaustible treasure  that exists in the nation. The originals are scattered throughout  Roumanian literature. The finest collection is Herr P. Ispirescu's,  from which the stories numbered in the contents 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,  13, and 17 in the present volume have been selected. No. 11 is taken  from Herr T. M. Arsenie's small collection; the others have been drawn  from the columns of the periodical _Convorbiri Literare_. Of these  Nos. 5 and 14 are by the pen of Herr J. Creanga, No. 9 is the work of  Herr Miron Pompilin, while Nos. 1, 3, 7, 16 and 18 are by Herr  Slavice, who wrote No. 15 specially for this volume, in the Roumanian  language, just as it was related to him by the peasants.           *       *       *       *       *          CONTENTS.      1.

At the edge of the village, where the peasants' oxen break through the  hedges and the neighbors' hogs wallow in the ground under the fences,  there once stood a house. In this house lived a man, and the man had a  wife; but the wife grieved all day long.    \"What troubles you, dear wife, that you sit there drooping like a  frost-bitten bud in the sunlight?\" her husband asked one day. \"You  have all you need. So be cheerful, like other folks.\"    \"Let me alone, and ask no more questions!\" replied the wife, and  became still more melancholy than before.    Her husband questioned her the second time, and received the same  reply. But, when he asked again, she answered more fully.    \"Dear me,\" she said, \"why do you trouble your head about it? If you  know, you'll be just sorrowful as I am. It's better for me not to tell  you.\"    But, to this, people will never agree. If you tell a person he must  sit still, he is more anxious to move than ever. Stan was now  determined to know what was in his wife's mind.    \"If you are determined to hear, I'll tell you,\" said the wife.  \"There's no luck in the house, husband,--there's no luck in the  house!\"    \"Isn't the cow a good one? Are not the fruit-trees and bee-hives full?  Are not the fields fertile?\" asked Stan. \"You talk nonsense, if you  complain of any thing.\"    \"But, husband, we have no children.\"    Stan understood; and, when a man realizes such a thing, it isn't well.  From this time, a sorrowful man and a sorrowful woman lived in the  house on the edge of the village. And they were sorrowful because the  Lord had given them no children. When the wife saw her husband sad,  she grew still more melancholy; and the more melancholy she was, the  greater his grief became.    This continued for a long time.    They had masses repeated and prayers read in all the churches. They  questioned all the witches, but God's gift did not come.    One day, two travelers arrived at Stan's house, and were joyfully  received and entertained with the best food he had. They were angels  in disguise; and, perceiving that Stan and his wife were good people,  one of them, while throwing his knapsack over his shoulder to continue  his journey, asked his host what he most desired, and said that any  three of his wishes should be fulfilled.    \"Give me children,\" replied Stan.    \"What else shall I give you?\"    \"Children, sir, give me children!\"    \"Take care,\" said the angel, \"or there will be too many of them. Have  you enough to support them?\"    \"Never mind that, sir,--only give them to me!\"    The travelers departed; but Stan accompanied them as far as the  high-road, that they might not lose their way among the fields and  woods.    When Stan reached home again, he found the house, yard, and garden  filled with children, in all not less than a hundred. Not one was  larger than the other; but each was more quarrelsome, bolder, more  mischievous and noisier than the rest. And, in some way, God made Stan  feel and know that they all belonged to him and were his.    \"Good gracious! What a lot of them!\" he cried, standing in the midst  of the throng.    \"But not too many, husband,\" replied his wife, bringing a little flock  with her.    Then followed days which can only be experienced by a man who has a  hundred children. The house and village echoed with shouts of \"father\"  and \"mother,\" and the world was full of happiness.    But taking care of children isn't so simple a matter. Many pleasures  come with many troubles, and many troubles with many joys. When, after  a few days, the children began to shout, \"Father, I'm hungry!\" Stan  began to scratch his head. There did not seem to him to be too many  children, for God's gift is good, however large it may be; but his  barns were too small, the cow was growing thin, and the fields did  not produce enough.    \"I'll tell you what, wife,\" said Stan one day, \"it seems to me that  there isn't much harmony in our affairs. As God was good enough to  give us so many children, He ought to have filled the measure of His  goodness, and sent us food for them, too.\"    \"Search for it, husband,\" the wife answered. \"Who knows where it may  be concealed? The Lord never does a thing by halves.\"    Stan went out into the wide world to find God's gift. He was firmly  resolved to return home laden with food.    Aha! The road of the hungry is always a long one. A man doesn't earn  food for a hundred greedy children in a trice. Stan wandered on, on,  on, till he had fairly run himself off his feet. When he had thus  arrived nearly at the end of the world, where what is mixes with what  is not, he saw in the distance, in the middle of a field which lay  spread out as flat as a cake, a sheep-fold. By it stood seven  shepherds, and in the shadow within lay a flock of sheep.    \"Lord, help me,\" said Stan, and went up to the fold to see whether, by  patience and discretion, he might not find some employment there. But  he soon discovered that there was not much more hope here than in the  other places whither he had journeyed. This was the state of affairs:  every night, at precisely twelve o'clock, a furious dragon came and  took from the herd a ram, a sheep, and a lamb, three animals in all.  He also carried milk enough for seventy-seven lambkins to the old  she-dragon, that she might bathe in it and grow young. The shepherds  were very angry about it, and complained bitterly. So Stan saw that he  was not likely to return home from here richly laden with food for his  children.    But there is no spur more powerful than for a man to see his children  starving. An idea entered Stan's head, and he said boldly, \"What would  you give me, if I released you from the greedy dragon?\"    \"One of each three rams shall be yours, one-third of the sheep, and  one-third of the lambs,\" replied the shepherds.    \"Agreed,\" said Stan; yet he felt rather anxious, lest he might find it  too hard to drive the flock home alone.    But there was no hurry about that. It was some time before midnight.  And besides, to tell the truth, Stan did not exactly know how he was  to get rid of the dragon. \"The Lord will send me some clever plan,\" he  said to himself, and then counted the flock again to see how many  animals he would have.    Just at midnight, when day and night, weary of strife, for a moment  stood still, Stan felt that he was about to see something he had never  beheld before. It was something that can not be described. It is a  horrible thing to have a dragon come. It seemed as if the monster was  hurling huge rocks at the trees, and thus forcing a way through  primeval forests. Even Stan felt that he should be wise to take the  quickest way off, and enter into no quarrel with a dragon. Ah! but his  children at home were starving.    \"I'll kill you or you shall kill me!\" Stan said to himself, and  remained where he was, close by the sheep-fold.    \"Stop!\" he cried, when he saw the dragon near the fold; and he shouted  as though he was a person of importance.    \"H'm,\" said the dragon: \"where did you come from, that you screech at  me so?\"    \"I am Stan Bolovan, who at night devours rocks and by day grazes on  the trees of the primeval forests; and if you touch the flock, I'll  cut a cross on your back, and bathe you in holy water.\"    When the dragon heard these words, he stopped in the midst of his  career; for he saw that he had found his match.    \"But you must first fight with me,\" replied the dragon, hesitatingly.    \"_I_ fight with you?\" cried Stan. \"Beware of the words that have  escaped"]]]
