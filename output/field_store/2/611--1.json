PRESSWORK BY GINN & CO., BOSTON, U.S.A.          PREFACE.      The rapid advances made in the science of botany within the last few  years necessitate changes in the text books in use as well as in  methods of teaching. Having, in his own experience as a teacher, felt  the need of a book different from any now in use, the author has  prepared the present volume with a hope that it may serve the purpose  for which it is intended; viz., an introduction to the study of botany  for use in high schools especially, but sufficiently comprehensive to  serve also as a beginning book in most colleges.    It does not pretend to be a complete treatise of the whole science,  and this, it is hoped, will be sufficient apology for the absence from  its pages of many important subjects, especially physiological topics.  It was found impracticable to compress within the limits of a book of  moderate size anything like a thorough discussion of even the most  important topics of _all_ the departments of botany. As a thorough  understanding of the structure of any organism forms the basis of all  further intelligent study of the same, it has seemed to the author  proper to emphasize this feature in the present work, which is  professedly an _introduction_, only, to the science.    This structural work has been supplemented by so much classification  as will serve to make clear the relationships of different groups, and  the principles upon which the classification is based, as well as  enable the student to recognize the commoner types of the different  groups as they are met with. The aim of this book is not, however,  merely the identification of plants. We wish here to enter a strong  protest against the only too prevalent idea that the chief aim of  botany is the ability to run down a plant by means of an \"Analytical  Key,\" the subject being exhausted as soon as the name of the plant is  discovered. A knowledge of the plant itself is far more important than  its name, however desirable it may be to know the latter.    In selecting the plants employed as examples of the different groups,  such were chosen, as far as possible, as are everywhere common. Of  course this was not always possible, as some important forms, _e.g._  the red and brown seaweeds, are necessarily not always readily  procurable by all students, but it will be found that the great  majority of the forms used, or closely related ones, are within the  reach of nearly all students; and such directions are given for  collecting and preserving them as will make it possible even for those  in the larger cities to supply themselves with the necessary  materials. Such directions, too, for the manipulation and examination  of specimens are given as will make the book, it is hoped, a  laboratory guide as well as a manual of classification. Indeed, it is  primarily intended that the book should so serve as a help in the  study of the actual specimens.    Although much can be done in the study, even of the lowest plants,  without microscopic aid other than a hand lens, for a thorough  understanding of the structure of any plant a good compound microscope  is indispensable, and wherever it is possible the student should be  provided with such an instrument, to use this book to the best  advantage. As, however, many are not able to have the use of a  microscope, the gross anatomy of all the forms described has been  carefully treated for the especial benefit of such students. Such  portions of the text, as well as the general discussions, are printed  in ordinary type, while the minute anatomy, and all points requiring  microscopic aid, are discussed in separate paragraphs printed in  smaller type.    The drawings, with very few exceptions, which are duly credited, were  drawn from nature by the author, and nearly all expressly for this  work.    A list of the most useful books of reference is appended, all of which  have been more or less consulted in the preparation of the following  pages.    The classification adopted is, with slight changes, that given in  Goebel's \"Outlines of Morphology and Classification\"; while, perhaps,  not in all respects entirely satisfactory, it seems to represent more  nearly than any other our present knowledge of the subject. Certain  groups, like the Diatoms and _Characeae_, are puzzles to the botanist,  and at present it is impossible to give them more than a provisional  place in the system.    If this volume serves to give the student some comprehension of the  real aims of botanical science, and its claims to be something more  than the \"Analysis\" of flowers, it will have fulfilled its mission.

CORRESPONDENCE    RELATING TO    EXECUTIONS IN TURKEY    FOR    APOSTACY FROM ISLAMISM.              No. 1.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  September_ 20.)    (Extract.)                        _Buyukderé, August_ 27, 1843.    Within the last few days an execution has taken place at  Constantinople under circumstances which have occasioned much  excitement and indignation among the Christian inhabitants. The  sufferer was an Armenian youth of eighteen or twenty years, who  having, under fear of punishment, declared himself a Turk, went to  the Island of Syra, and returning, after an absence of some length,  resumed his former religion. Apprehensive of the danger but resolved  not to deny his real faith a second time, he kept out of sight till  accident betrayed him to the police, and he was then thrown into  prison. In spite of threats, promises, and blows, he there  maintained his resolution, refused to save his life by a fresh  disavowal of Christianity, and was finally decapitated in one of the  most frequented parts of the city with circumstances of great  barbarity.    Inclosed herewith is a statement of the particulars drawn up by Mr.  Alison.    It is not merely on grounds of humanity that I would draw your  Lordship's attention to this incident: political considerations of  serious importance are connected with it; and on this account, no  less than from regard for the tears and entreaties of a distracted  family, I exhausted my influence in vain endeavours to divert the  Porte from its purpose. Every Member of the Council to whom I  applied, returned the same answer, expressing a willingness to meet  my wishes, and regretting the inexorable necessity of the law.    For my own part I do not believe that any such necessity exists. The  determination of the Government to sacrifice the Armenian youth, in  spite of my earnest solicitations, unless he recanted publicly, is  part and parcel of that system of reaction which preceded my arrival  here, against which I have constantly struggled, and which,  notwithstanding the assurances given to me, and the efforts of its  partisans to conceal it, is day by day gaining strength, to the  despair of every enlightened Turkish statesman, to the prejudice of  our relations with this country, and to the visible decline of those  improvements which, in my humble judgment, can alone avert the  dissolution of the Sultan's empire.    The law, which, in this instance, has torn a youth from the bosom of  his family, and consigned him to an ignominious and cruel death,  would apply with equal force to a subject of any Christian Power.    Such of my colleagues as I have consulted upon this subject appear  to take a view of it similar to my own, I refer, in particular, to  the Austrian, French, Russian, and Prussian Ministers: each of them  has told me that he intended to recommend the question to the  serious consideration of his Government.    Since my arrival here one British and two French subjects have  declared in favour of Mahomedanism, and much difficulty has been  experienced in dealing with the individuals concerned. The British  subject, a Maltese, returned to the Catholic faith a few days after  he had declared himself a Turk, and he was privately conveyed out of  this country. The Porte, on that occasion, evidently identified the  change of allegiance with the change of creed, and not only would a  trifling incident have sufficed to raise the question arising out of  that principle between Her Majesty's Embassy and the Porte, but had  the man been arrested after his recantation, I should perhaps have  been reduced to the necessity of putting all to hazard in order to  snatch him from the hands of the executioner.    The only* Articles relating to this matter in our Capitulations with  the Porte are the sixty-first and seventy-first. The French have an  Article of similar meaning in their capitulations, and by the Treaty  of Kainardji between Russia and the Porte it was agreed that  individuals who had changed their religion should be mutually  exempted from the operation of the Article, which otherwise  stipulates for the extradition of refugees and malefactors.    * Article LXI.--That if any Englishman should turn Turk, and it  should be represented and proved that besides his own goods he has  in his hands any property belonging to another person in England,  such property shall be taken from him and delivered up to the  Ambassador or Consul, that they may convey the same to the owner  thereof.    Article LXXI.--That should any Englishman coming with merchandize  turn Turk, and the goods so imported by him be proved to belong to  merchants of his own country, from whom he had taken them, the whole  shall be detained, with the ready money, and delivered up to the  Ambassador, in order to his transmitting the same to the right  owners, without any of our judges or officers interposing any  obstacle or hindrance thereto.    Under these impressions I trust that your Lordship will not think I  have exceeded the bounds of prudence in stating confidentially,  though without reserve, to the Grand Vizier the impressions made  upon my mind by the recent execution. Couched as my message was in  respectful and kindly terms, I hope it will operate as a salutary  admonition. The interpreter's report of his Highness' reply is  inclosed with this despatch.    Inclosure l in No. 1.    _Case of the Armenian Avakim, son of Yagya, of the parish of Top  Kapousee_.    About a year and a half ago Avakim having had a drunken quarrel with  some neighbours, was sentenced at the War Office to receive 500  bastinadoes.    Fear and intoxication induced him to become a Mussulman, and he was  conducted on the spot to the Mehkemé where the name of Mehemet was  given him.    Some days afterwards Avakim repented of what he had done, and fled  to Syra, from whence he returned a few months ago.    About three months ago, while returning from his sister's house with  a small bundle containing wearing apparel, he was recognized by the  Kolaga of the quarter, Mustapha, and denounced at the War Office of  having renegaded from Islamism. He was then submitted to the most  cruel punishment to compel him to re-abandon his original belief,  and was even paraded through the streets with his hands tied behind  his back as if for execution. Avakim, however, unintimidated by  torture or the prospect of death, proclaimed aloud his firm belief  in Christianity, and was led forth to suffer on Wednesday last  amidst the execrations of the Ulema partisans.    Only one man, Taouk-Bazarli Ali, among the thirty armed police who  conducted him, could be prevailed upon to strike the blow. Many of  the Turks spat on him as they passed, and openly reviled the faith  for which he had died. A Yafta, in the following terms, was affixed  on the opposite shop:--    \"The Armenian shoemaker, Avakim, son of Yagya, having last year, in  the beginning of Moharrem, while at an age of discretion, accepted  Islamism, and received the name of Mehemet, some time afterwards  renegaded, and having now obstinately persisted in refusing the  proffer made to him by the law to re-become a Moslem, sentence of  death was awarded unto him according to fetwa, and he has thereby  suffered.\"    The first intelligence received in Pera of this occurrence was the  appearance in the streets of the unfortunate lad's mother tearing  her grey hair, and rushing distractedly from the scene of bloodshed.  The poor old woman, when assured of her boy's fate, returned and sat  in grief by the corpse, from which she was afterwards removed.    A petition of the Armenians for the corpse was rejected, and it was  after three days exposure cast into the sea.    _Constantinople, August_ 27, 1843.    Inclosure 2 in No. 1.    M. Pisani to Sir Stratford Canning.    Excellence,                       _Péra, le_ 24 _Août_, 1843.    Conformément à vos ordres, j'ai vu le Grand Vizir, et je lui ai  rendu, mot à mot, le message contenu dans votre instruction  confidentielle en date d'hier, relativement au jeune Arménien qui  vient d'être exécuté. Son Altesse a répondu de la manière suivante:    \"Quant à moi, personnellement, j'ai en horreur même d'égorger une  poule. Les exécutions, si fréquentes dans l'ancien système, sont  très rares aujourd'hui. Mais dans le cas récent, je vous ai déjà  dit, et je vous répète, qui ni les Ministres, ni le Sultan, ne  pouvaient absolument pas sauver la vie de l'Arménien. Les lois du  Coran ne forcent personne de se faire Musulman; mais elles sont  inexorables tant à l'égard du Musulman qui embrasse une autre  religion, qu'à l'égard du non-Musulman qui, après avoir de son  propre gré embrassé publiquement l'Islamisme, est convaincu d'y  avoir renoncé. Nulle considération ne peut faire commuer la peine  capitale à laquelle la loi le condamne sans miséricorde. Le seul,  l'unique moyen d'échapper à la mort, c'est pour l'accusé de déclarer  qu'il s'est fait de nouveau Musulman. C'est dans le seul but de  sauver la vie a l'individu en question que nous avons, contre la  lettre de la loi, qui exige que la sentence dans le cas dont il  s'agit soit mise à exécution aussitôt qu'elle a été prononcée, que  nous lui avons laissé quelques jours de temps pour y bien réflêchir,  avec l'assurance que la déclaration voulue par la loi une fois  faite, il serait mis en liberté, et qu'il pourrait partir de  Constantinople; mais comme il a résisté à toutes les tentatives  faites pour le persuader de recourir au seul moyen d'échapper à la  mort, force fut à la fin d'obéir à la loi, sans quoi les Oulémas se  souleveraient contre nous.
