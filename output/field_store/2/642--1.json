Tulsa, Okla.      I was born in Louisiana, way before the War. I think it was about ten  years before, because I can remember everything so well about the  start of the War, and I believe I was about ten years old.    My Mammy belonged to Mr. Sack P. Gee. I don't know what his real given  name was, but it maybe was Saxon. Anyways we all called him Master  Sack.    He was a kind of youngish man, and was mighty rich. I think he was  born in England. Anyway his pappy was from England, and I think he  went back before I was born.    Master Sack had a big plantation ten miles north of Arcadia,  Louisiana, and his land run ten miles along both sides. He would leave  in a buggy and be gone all day and still not get all over it.    There was all kinds of land on it, and he raised cane and oats and  wheat and lots of corn and cotton. His cotton fields was the biggest  anywheres in that part, and when chopping and picking times come he  would get negroes from other people to help out. I never was no good  at picking, but I was a terror with a hoe!    I was the only child my Mammy had. She was just a young girl, and my  Master did not own her very long. He got her from Mr. Addison  Hilliard, where my pappy belonged. I think she was going to have me  when he got her; anyways I come along pretty soon, and my mammy never  was very well afterwards. Maybe Master Sack sent her back over to my  pappy. I don't know.    Mammy was the house girl at Mr. Sack's because she wasn't very strong,  and when I was four or five years old she died. I was big enough to do  little things for Mr. Sack and his daughter, so they kept me at the  mansion, and I helped the house boys. Time I was nine or ten Mr.  Sack's daughter was getting to be a young woman--fifteen or sixteen  years old--and that was old enough to get married off in them days.  They had a lot of company just before the War, and they had whole  bunch of house negroes around all the time.    Old Mistress died when I was a baby, so I don't remember anything  about her, but Young Mistress was a winder! She would ride horseback  nearly all the time, and I had to go along with her when I got big  enough. She never did go around the quarters, so I don't know nothing  much about the negroes Mr. Sack had for the fields. They all looked  pretty clean and healthy, though, when they would come up to the Big  House. He fed them all good and they all liked him.    He had so much different kinds of land that they could raise anything  they wanted, and he had more mules and horses and cattle than anybody  around there. Some of the boys worked with his fillies all the time,  and he went off to New Orleans ever once in a while with his race  horses. He took his daughter but they never took me.    Some of his land was in pasture but most of it was all open fields,  with just miles and miles of cotton rows. There was a pretty good  strip along one side he called the \"old\" fields. That's what they  called the land that was wore out and turned back. It was all growed  up in young trees, and that's where he kept his horses most of the  time.    The first I knowed about the War coming on was when Mr. Sack had a  whole bunch of whitefolks at the Big House at a function. They didn't  talk about anything else all evening and then the next time they come  nearly all their menfolks wasn't there--just the womenfolks. It wasn't  very long till Mr. Sack went off to Houma with some other men, and  pretty soon we knew he was in the War. I don't remember ever seeing  him come home. I don't think he did until it was nearly all over.    Next thing we knowed they was Confederate soldiers riding by pretty  nearly every day in big droves. Sometimes they would come and buy corn  and wheat and hogs, but they never did take any anyhow, like the  Yankees done later on. They would pay with billets, Young Missy called  them, and she didn't send them to git them cashed but saved them a  long time, and then she got them cashed, but you couldn't buy anything  with the money she got for them.    That Confederate money she got wasn't no good. I was in Arcadia with  her at a store, and she had to pay seventy-five cents for a can of  sardines for me to eat with some bread I had, and before the War you  could get a can like that for two cents. Things was even higher then  than later on, but that's the only time I saw her buy anything.    When the Yankees got down in that country the most of the big men paid  for all the corn and meat and things they got, but some of the little  bunches of them would ride up and take hogs and things like that and  just ride off. They wasn't anybody at our place but the womenfolks and  the negroes. Some of Mr. Sack's women kinfolks stayed there with Young  Mistress.    Along at the last the negroes on our place didn't put in much  stuff--jest what they would need, and could hide from the Yankees,  because they would get it all took away from them if the Yankees found  out they had plenty of corn and oats.    The Yankees was mighty nice about their manners, though. They camped  all around our place for a while. There was three camps of them close  by at one time, but they never did come and use any of our houses or  cabins. There was lots of poor whites and Cajuns that lived down below  us, between us and the Gulf, and the Yankees just moved into their  houses and cabins and used them to camp in.    The negroes at our place and all of them around there didn't try to  get away or leave when the Yankees come in. They wasn't no place to  go, anyway, so they all stayed on. But they didn't do very much work.  Just enough to take care of themselves and their whitefolks.    Master Sack come home before the War was quite over. I think he had  been sick, because he looked thin and old and worried. All the negroes  picked up and worked mighty hard after he come home, too.    One day he went into Arcadia and come home and told us the War was  over and we was all free. The negroes didn't know what to make of it,  and didn't know where to go, so he told all that wanted to stay on  that they could just go on like they had been and pay him shares.

DISASTER      The Throg task force struck the Terran Survey camp a few minutes after  dawn, without warning, and with a deadly precision which argued that the  aliens had fully reconnoitered and prepared that attack. Eye-searing  lances of energy lashed back and forth across the base with methodical  accuracy. And a single cowering witness, flattened on a ledge in the  heights above, knew that when the last of those yellow-red bolts fell,  nothing human would be left alive down there. His teeth closed hard upon  the thick stuff of the sleeve covering his thin forearm, and in his  throat a scream of terror and rage was stillborn.    More than caution kept him pinned on that narrow shelf of rock. Watching  that holocaust below, Shann Lantee could not force himself to move. The  sheer ruthlessness of the Throg move-in left him momentarily weak. To  listen to a tale of Throgs in action, and to be an eye-witness to such  action, were two vastly different things. He shivered in spite of the  warmth of the Survey Corps uniform.    As yet he had sighted none of the aliens, only their plate-shaped  flyers. They would stay aloft until their long-range weapon cleared out  all opposition. But how had they been able to make such a complete  annihilation of the Terran force? The last report had placed the nearest  Throg nest at least two systems away from Warlock. And a patrol lane had  been drawn about the Circe system the minute that Survey had marked its  second planet ready for colonization. Somehow the beetles had slipped  through that supposedly tight cordon and would now consolidate their  gains with their usual speed at rooting. First an energy attack to  finish the small Terran force; then they would simply take over.    A month later, or maybe two months, and they could not have done it. The  grids would have been up, and any Throg ship venturing into Warlock's  amber-tinted sky would abruptly cease to be. In the race for survival as  a galactic power, Terra had that one small edge over the swarms of the  enemy. They need only stake out their new-found world and get the grids  assembled on its surface; then that planet would be locked to the  beetles. The critical period was between the first discovery of a  suitable colony world and the erection of grid control. Planets in the  past had been lost during that time lag, just as Warlock was lost now.    Throgs and Terrans ... For more than a century now, planet time, they  had been fighting their queer, twisted war among the stars. Terrans  hunted worlds for colonization, the old hunger for land of their own  driving men from the over-populated worlds, out of Sol's system to the  far stars. And those worlds barren of intelligent native life, open to  settlers, were none too many and widely scattered. Perhaps half a dozen  were found in a quarter century, and of that six maybe only one was  suitable for human life without any costly and lengthy adaption of man  or world. Warlock was one of the lucky finds which came so seldom.    Throgs were predators, living on the loot they garnered. As yet, mankind  had not been able to discover whether they did indeed swarm from any  home world. Perhaps they lived eternally on board their plate ships with  no permanent base, forced into a wandering life by the destruction of  the planet on which they had originally been spawned. But they were  raiders now, laying waste defenseless worlds, picking up the wealth of  shattered cities in which no native life remained. And their hidden  temporary bases were looped about the galaxy, their need for worlds with  an atmosphere similar to Terra's as necessary as that of man. For in  spite of their grotesque insectile bodies, their wholly alien minds, the  Throgs were warm-blooded, oxygen-breathing creatures.    After the first few clashes the early Terran explorers had endeavored to  promote a truce between the species, only to discover that between Throg  and man there appeared to be no meeting ground at all--total differences  of mental processes producing insurmountable misunderstanding. There was  simply no point of communication. So the Terrans had suffered one  smarting defeat after another until they perfected the grid. And now  their colonies were safe, at least when time worked in their favor.    It had not on Warlock.    A last vivid lash of red cracked over the huddle of domes in the valley.  Shann blinked, half blinded by that glare. His jaws ached as he  unclenched his teeth. That was the finish. Breathing raggedly, he raised  his head, beginning to realize that he was the only one of his kind left  alive on a none-too-hospitable world controlled by enemies--without  shelter or supplies.    He edged back into the narrow cleft which was the entrance to the ledge.  As a representative of his species he was not impressive, and now with  those shudders he could not master, shaking his thin body, he looked  even smaller and more vulnerable. Shann drew his knees up close under  his chin. The hood of his woodsman's jacket was pushed back in spite of  the chill of the morning, and he wiped the back of his hand across his  lips and chin in an oddly childish gesture.    None of the men below who had been alive only minutes earlier had been  close friends of his; Shann had never known anyone but acquaintances in  his short, roving life. Most people had ignored him completely except to  give orders, and one or two had been actively malicious--like Garth  Thorvald. Shann grimaced at a certain recent memory, and then that  grimace faded into wonder. If young Thorvald hadn't purposefully tried  to get Shann into trouble by opening the wolverines' cage, Shann  wouldn't be here now--alive and safe for a time--he'd have been down  there with the others.    The wolverines! For the first time since Shann had heard the crackle of  the Throg attack he remembered the reason he had been heading into the  hills. Of all the men on the Survey team, Shann Lantee had been the  least important. The dirty, tedious clean-up jobs, the dull routines  which required no technical training but which had to be performed to  keep the camp functioning comfortably, those had been his portion. And  he had accepted that status willingly, just to have a chance to be  included among Survey personnel. Not that he had the slightest hope of  climbing up to even an S-E-Three rating in the service.    Part of those menial activities had been to clean the animal cages. And  there Shann Lantee had found something new, something so absorbing that  most of the tiring dull labor had ceased to exist except as tasks to  finish before he could return to the fascination of the animal runs.    Survey teams had early discovered the advantage of using mutated and  highly trained Terran animals as assistants in the exploration of  strange worlds. From the biological laboratories and breeding farms on  Terra came a trickle of specialized aides-de-camp to accompany man into  space. Some were fighters, silent, more deadly than weapons a man wore  at his belt or carried in his hands. Some were keener eyes, keener  noses, keener scouts than the human kind could produce. Bred for  intelligence, for size, for adaptability to alien conditions, the animal  explorers from Terra were prized.    Wolverines, the ancient \"devils\" of the northlands on Terra, were being  tried for the first time on Warlock. Their caution, a quality highly  developed in their breed, made them testers for new territory. Able to  tackle in battle an animal three times their size, they should be added  protection for the man they accompanied into the wilderness, and their  wide ranging, their ability to climb and swim, and above all, their  curiosity were assets.    Shann had begun contact by cleaning their cages; he ended captivated by  these miniature bears with long bushy tails. And to his unbounded  delight the attraction was mutual. Alone to Taggi and Togi he was a  person, an important person. Those teeth, which could tear flesh into  ragged strips, nipped gently at his fingers, closed without any pressure  on arm, even on nose and chin in what was the ultimate caress of their  kind. Since they were escape artists of no mean ability, twice he had  had to track and lead them back to camp from forays of their own  devising.    But the second time he had been caught by Fadakar, the chief of animal  control, before he could lock up the delinquents. And the memory of the  resulting interview still had the power to make him flush with impotent  anger. Shann's explanation had been contemptuously brushed aside, and he  had been delivered an ultimatum. If his carelessness occurred again, he  would be sent back on the next supply ship, to be dismissed without an  official sign-off on his work record, thus locked out of even the lowest  level of Survey for the rest of his life.    That was why Garth Thorvald's act of the night before had made Shann  brave the unknown darkness of Warlock alone when he had discovered that  the test animals were gone."]]]
