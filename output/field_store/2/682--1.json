Ch. 1. 1. The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and  unchanging Tao.  The name that can be named is not the enduring and  unchanging name.    2. (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven  and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all  things.    3.       Always without desire we must be found,     If its deep mystery we would sound;     But if desire always within us be,     Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.    4. Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development  takes place, it receives the different names.  Together we call them  the Mystery.  Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that  is subtle and wonderful.      2. 1. All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing  this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill  of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the  want of skill is.    2. So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to  (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the  idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the  figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from  the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and  tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and  that being before and behind give the idea of one following another.    3. Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and  conveys his instructions without the use of speech.    4. All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show  itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership;  they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a  reward for the results).  The work is accomplished, and there is no  resting in it (as an achievement).       The work is done, but how no one can see;    'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.      3. 1. Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to  keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles  which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming  thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is  the way to keep their minds from disorder.    2. Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties  their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens  their bones.    3. He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without  desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them  from presuming to act (on it).  When there is this abstinence from  action, good order is universal.      4. 1. The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our  employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness.  How  deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of  all things!    2. We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of  things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into  agreement with the obscurity of others.  How pure and still the Tao  is, as if it would ever so continue!    3. I do not know whose son it is.  It might appear to have been before  God.      5. 1. Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be  benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt  with.  The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they  deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.    2. May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a  bellows?      'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power;    'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more.     Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see;     Your inner being guard, and keep it free.      6.       The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;     The female mystery thus do we name.     Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,     Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.     Long and unbroken does its power remain,     Used gently, and without the touch of pain.      7. 1. Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long.  The reason  why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is  because they do not live of, or for, themselves.  This is how they are  able to continue and endure.    2. Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in  the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him,  and yet that person is preserved.  Is it not because he has no  personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised?      8. 1. The highest excellence is like (that of) water.  The excellence  of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying,  without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men  dislike.  Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao.    2. The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place;  that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in  their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing  good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and  that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness.    3. And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about  his low position), no one finds fault with him.      9. 1. It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to  carry it when it is full.  If you keep feeling a point that has been  sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.    2. When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them  safe.  When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil  on itself.  When the work is done, and one's name is becoming  distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven.      10. 1. When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one  embrace, they can be kept from separating.  When one gives undivided  attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of  pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe.  When he has cleansed away  the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without  a flaw.    2. In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed  without any (purpose of) action?  In the opening and shutting of his  gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird?  While his  intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be  without knowledge?    3. (The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces  them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not  boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them.  This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao).      11. The thirty spokes unite in the one nave; but it is on the empty  space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends.  Clay is  fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that  their use depends.  The door and windows are cut out (from the walls)  to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its  use depends.  Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for  profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness.      12.    1.       Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take;     Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make;     The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste;     The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste     Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange,     Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change.    2. Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and  not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes.  He puts from him the  latter, and prefers to seek the former.      13. 1. Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and  great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same  kind).    2. What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace?  Disgrace is  being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour).  The getting  that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing  it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is  meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be  feared.    And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be  (similarly) regarded as personal conditions?  What makes me liable to  great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had  not the body, what great calamity could come to me?    3. Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he  honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would  administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be  entrusted with it.      14. 1. We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the  Equable.'  We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the  Inaudible.'  We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we  name it 'the Subtle.'  With these three qualities, it cannot be made  the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and  obtain The One.    2. Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure.  Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again  returns and becomes nothing.  This is called the Form of the Formless,  and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and  Indeterminable.    3. We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see  its Back.  When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things  of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the  beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao.      15. 1. The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle  and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep  (also) so as to elude men's knowledge.

ABERGAVENNY, Aug. 4.    RESPECTED SIR,    I have received your esteemed favour of the 13th ultimo, whereby it  appeareth, that you have perused those same Letters, the which were  delivered unto you by my friend, the reverend Mr Hugo Behn; and I am  pleased to find you think they may be printed with a good prospect of  success; in as much as the objections you mention, I humbly conceive,  are such as may be redargued, if not entirely removed--And, first, in  the first place, as touching what prosecutions may arise from printing  the private correspondence of persons still living, give me leave, with  all due submission, to observe, that the Letters in question were not  written and sent under the seal of secrecy; that they have no tendency  to the mala fama, or prejudice of any person whatsoever; but rather to  the information and edification of mankind: so that it becometh a sort  of duty to promulgate them in usum publicum. Besides, I have consulted  Mr Davy Higgins, an eminent attorney of this place, who, after due  inspection and consideration, declareth, That he doth not think the said  Letters contain any matter which will be held actionable in the eye of  the law. Finally, if you and I should come to a right understanding, I  do declare in verbo sacerdotis, that, in case of any such prosecution,  I will take the whole upon my own shoulders, even quoad fine and  imprisonment, though, I must confess, I should not care to undergo  flagellation: Tam ad turpitudinem, quam ad amaritudinem poenoe  spectans--Secondly, concerning the personal resentment of Mr Justice  Lismahago, I may say, non flocci facio--I would not willingly vilipend  any Christian, if, peradventure, he deserveth that epithet: albeit, I  am much surprised that more care is not taken to exclude from the  commission all such vagrant foreigners as may be justly suspected of  disaffection to our happy constitution, in church and state--God forbid  that I should be so uncharitable, as to affirm, positively, that the  said Lismahago is no better than a Jesuit in disguise; but this I will  assert and maintain, totis viribus, that, from the day he qualified, he  has never been once seen intra templi parietes, that is to say, within  the parish church.    Thirdly, with respect to what passed at Mr Kendal's table, when the said  Lismahago was so brutal in his reprehensions, I must inform you, my good  Sir, that I was obliged to retire, not by fear arising from his minatory  reproaches, which, as I said above, I value not of a rush; but from the  sudden effect produced, by a barbel's row, which I had eaten at  dinner, not knowing, that the said row is at certain seasons violently  cathartic, as Galen observeth in his chapter Peri ichtos.    Fourthly, and lastly, with reference to the manner in which I got  possession of these Letters, it is a circumstance that concerns my own  conscience only; sufficeth it to say, I have fully satisfied the parties  in whose custody they were; and, by this time, I hope I have also  satisfied you in such ways, that the last hand may be put to our  agreement, and the work proceed with all convenient expedition; in which  I hope I rest,    Respected Sir, Your very humble servant,    JONATHAN DUSTWICH.    P.S. I propose, Deo volente, to have the pleasure of seeing you in the  great city, towards All-hallowtide, when I shall be glad to treat with  you concerning a parcel of MS. sermons, of a certain clergyman deceased;  a cake of the right leaven, for the present taste of the public. Verbum  sapienti, &c.    J.D.          To the Revd. Mr JONATHAN DUSTWICH, at--    SIR,    I received yours in course of post, and shall be glad to treat with you  for the M.S. which I have delivered to your friend Mr Behn; but can  by no means comply with the terms proposed. Those things are so  uncertain--Writing is all a lottery--I have been a loser by the works  of the greatest men of the age--I could mention particulars, and name  names; but don't choose it--The taste of the town is so changeable.  Then there have been so many letters upon travels lately published--What  between Smollett's, Sharp's, Derrick's, Thicknesse's, Baltimore's, and  Baretti's, together with Shandy's Sentimental Travels, the public seems  to be cloyed with that kind of entertainment--Nevertheless, I will,  if you please, run the risque of printing and publishing, and you shall  have half the profits of the impression--You need not take the trouble  to bring up your sermons on my account--No body reads sermons but  Methodists and Dissenters--Besides, for my own part, I am quite a  stranger to that sort of reading; and the two persons, whose judgment I  depended upon in those matters, are out of the way; one is gone abroad,  carpenter of a man of war; and the other, has been silly enough to  abscond, in order to avoid a prosecution for blasphemy--I'm a great  loser by his going off--He has left a manual of devotion half finished  on my hands, after having received money for the whole copy--He was the  soundest divine, and had the most orthodox pen of all my people; and I  never knew his judgment fail, but in flying from his bread and butter on  this occasion.    By owning you was not put in bodily fear by Lismahago, you preclude  yourself from the benefit of a good plea, over and above the advantage  of binding him over. In the late war, I inserted in my evening paper,  a paragraph that came by the post, reflecting upon the behaviour of a  certain regiment in battle. An officer of said regiment came to my shop,  and, in the presence of my wife and journeyman, threatened to cut off  my ears--As I exhibited marks of bodily fear more ways than one, to the  conviction of the byestanders, I bound him over; my action lay, and I  recovered. As for flagellation, you have nothing to fear, and nothing to  hope, on that head--There has been but one printer flogged at the cart's  tail these thirty years; that was Charles Watson; and he assured me it  was no more than a flea-bite. C-- S-- has been threatened several times  by the House of L--; but it came to nothing. If an information should  be moved for, and granted against you, as the editor of those Letters,  I hope you will have honesty and wit enough to appear and take your  trial--If you should be sentenced to the pillory, your fortune is  made--As times go, that's a sure step to honour and preferment. I shall  think myself happy if I can lend you a lift; and am, very sincerely,    Yours,    HENRY DAVIS. LONDON, Aug. 10th.    Please my kind service to your neighbour, my cousin Madoc--I have  sent an Almanack and Court-kalendar, directed for him at Mr Sutton's,  bookseller, in Gloucester, carriage paid, which he will please to accept  as a small token of my regard. My wife, who is very fond of toasted  cheese, presents her compliments to him, and begs to know if there's any  of that kind, which he was so good as to send us last Christmas, to be  sold in London.    H. D.          THE EXPEDITION OF HUMPHRY CLINKER          To Dr LEWIS.    DOCTOR,    The pills are good for nothing--I might as well swallow snowballs to  cool my reins--I have told you over and over how hard I am to move; and  at this time of day, I ought to know something of my own constitution.  Why will you be so positive? Prithee send me another prescription--I am  as lame and as much tortured in all my limbs as if I was broke upon the  wheel: indeed, I am equally distressed in mind and body--As if I had not  plagues enough of my own, those children of my sister are left me for a  perpetual source of vexation--what business have people to get children  to plague their neighbours? A ridiculous incident that happened  yesterday to my niece Liddy, has disordered me in such a manner, that  I expect to be laid up with another fit of the gout--perhaps, I may  explain myself in my next. I shall set out tomorrow morning for the  Hot Well at Bristol, where I am afraid I shall stay longer than I could  wish. On the receipt of this send Williams thither with my saddle-horse  and the demi pique. Tell Barns to thresh out the two old ricks, and send  the corn to market, and sell it off to the poor at a shilling a bushel  under market price.--I have received a snivelling letter from Griffin,  offering to make a public submission and pay costs. I want none of his  submissions, neither will I pocket any of his money. The fellow is a bad  neighbour, and I desire, to have nothing to do with him: but as he is  purse-proud, he shall pay for his insolence: let him give five pounds to  the poor of the parish, and I will withdraw my action; and in the mean  time you may tell Prig to stop proceedings.--Let Morgan's widow have the  Alderney cow, and forty shillings to clothe her children: but don't say  a syllable of the matter to any living soul--I'll make her pay when she  is able. I desire you will lock up all my drawers, and keep the keys  till meeting; and be sure you take the iron chest with my papers into  your own custody--Forgive all, this trouble from,    Dear Lewis, Your affectionate M. BRAMBLE GLOUCESTER, April 2.          To Mrs GWYLLIM, house-keeper at Brambleton-hall.    MRS GWILLIM,    When this cums to hand, be sure to pack up in the trunk male that stands  in my closet; to be sent me in the Bristol waggon without loss of time,  the following articles, viz. my rose collard neglejay with green robins,  my yellow damask, and my black velvets with the short hoop; my bloo  quilted petticot, my green mantel, my laced apron, my French commode,  Macklin head and lappets and the litel box with my jowls. Williams may  bring over my bum-daffee, and the viol with the easings of Dr Hill's  dockwater and Chowder's lacksitif. The poor creature has been terribly  stuprated ever since we left huom.
