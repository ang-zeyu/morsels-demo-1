To  MY FATHER,  FROM WHOM I HAVE NEVER FAILED TO RECEIVE  LITERARY SYMPATHY AND ENCOURAGEMENT,  This Volume  IS DEDICATED.          PREFACE.      \"FAME AND FORTUNE,\" like its predecessor, \"Ragged Dick,\" was  contributed as a serial story to the \"Schoolmate,\" a popular juvenile  magazine published in Boston. The generous commendations of the first  volume by the Press, and by private correspondents whose position makes  their approval of value, have confirmed the author in his purpose to  write a series of stories intended to illustrate the life and experiences  of the friendless and vagrant children to be found in all our cities,  numbering in New York alone over twelve thousand.    In the preparation of the different volumes, the requisite information  will be gathered from personal observation mainly, supplemented,  however, by facts communicated by those who have been brought into  practical relations with the class of children whose lives are  portrayed.    The volumes might readily be made more matter-of-fact, but the author  has sought to depict the inner life and represent the feelings and  emotions of these little waifs of city life, and hopes thus to excite a  deeper and more widespread sympathy in the public mind, as well as to  exert a salutary influence upon the class of whom he is writing, by  setting before them inspiring examples of what energy, ambition, and an  honest purpose may achieve, even in their case.    In order to reach as large a number of these boys as possible, the  publisher is authorized, on application, to send a gratuitous copy of  the two volumes of the \"Ragged Dick Series\" already issued, to any  regularly organized Newsboys' Lodge within the United States.    NEW YORK, _December_, 1868.          FAME AND FORTUNE;  OR, THE  PROGRESS OF RICHARD HUNTER.          CHAPTER I.    A BOARDING-HOUSE IN BLEECKER STREET.      \"Well, Fosdick, this is a little better than our old room in Mott  Street,\" said Richard Hunter, looking complacently about him.    \"You're right, Dick,\" said his friend. \"This carpet's rather nicer than  the ragged one Mrs. Mooney supplied us with. The beds are neat and  comfortable, and I feel better satisfied, even if we do have to pay  twice as much for it.\"    The room which yielded so much satisfaction to the two boys was on the  fourth floor of a boarding-house in Bleecker Street. No doubt many of my  young readers, who are accustomed to elegant homes, would think it very  plain; but neither Richard nor his friend had been used to anything as  good. They had been thrown upon their own exertions at an early age, and  had a hard battle to fight with poverty and ignorance. Those of my  readers who are familiar with Richard Hunter's experiences when he was  \"Ragged Dick,\" will easily understand what a great rise in the world it  was for him to have a really respectable home. For years he had led a  vagabond life about the streets, as a boot-black, sleeping in old  wagons, or boxes, or wherever he could find a lodging gratis. It was  only twelve months since a chance meeting with an intelligent boy caused  him to form the resolution to grow up respectable. By diligent evening  study with Henry Fosdick, whose advantages had been much greater than  his own, assisted by a natural quickness and an unusual aptitude for  learning, he had, in a year, learned to read and write well, and had,  besides, made considerable progress in arithmetic. Still he would have  found it difficult to obtain a situation if he had not been the means of  saving from drowning the young child of Mr. James Rockwell, a wealthy  merchant in business on Pearl Street, who at once, out of gratitude for  the service rendered, engaged our hero in his employ at the unusual  compensation, for a beginner, of ten dollars a week. His friend, Henry  Fosdick, was in a hat store on Broadway, but thus far only received six  dollars a week.    Feeling that it was time to change their quarters to a more respectable  portion of the city, they one morning rang the bell of Mrs. Browning's  boarding-house, on Bleecker Street.    They were shown into the parlor, and soon a tall lady, with flaxen  ringlets and a thin face, came in.    \"Well, young gentleman, what can I do for you?\" she said, regarding them  attentively.    \"My friend and I are looking for a boarding-place,\" said Henry Fosdick.  \"Have you any rooms vacant?\"    \"What sort of a room would you like?\" asked Mrs. Browning.    \"We cannot afford to pay a high price. We should be satisfied with a  small room.\"    \"You will room together, I suppose?\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"I have a room vacant on the third floor, quite a good-sized one, for  which I should charge you seven dollars apiece. There is a room on the  fourth floor, not so large, which you can have for five dollars each.\"    \"I think we'll look at that,\" said Richard Hunter.    \"Very well, then follow me.\"    Mrs. Browning preceded the boys to the fourth floor, where she opened  the door of a neat room, provided with two single beds, a good-sized  mirror, a bureau, a warm woollen carpet, a washstand, and an empty  bookcase for books. There was a closet also, the door of which she  opened, showing a row of pegs for clothing.    \"How do you like it?\" asked Fosdick, in a low voice, turning to his  companion.    \"It's bully,\" said Dick, in admiring accents.    I may as well say here, what the reader will find out as we proceed,  that our hero, in spite of his advance in learning, had not got entirely  rid of some street phrases, which he had caught from the companions with  whom he had for years associated.    \"Five dollars is rather a steep price,\" said Fosdick, in a low voice.  \"You know I don't get but six in all.\"    \"I'll tell you what, Fosdick,\" said Dick; \"it'll be ten dollars for the  two of us. I'll pay six, and you shall pay four. That'll be fair,--won't  it?\"    \"No, Dick, I ought to pay my half.\"    \"You can make it up by helpin' me when I run against a snag, in my  studies.\"    \"You know as much as I do now, Dick.\"    \"No, I don't. I haven't any more ideas of grammar than a broomstick. You  know I called 'cat' a conjunction the other day. Now, you shall help me  in grammar, for I'm blessed if I know whether I'm a noun or an  adjective, and I'll pay a dollar towards your board.\"    \"But, Dick, I'm willing to help you for nothing. It isn't fair to charge  you a dollar a week for my help.\"    \"Why isn't it? Aint I to get ten dollars a week, and shan't I have four  dollars over, while you will only have two? I think I ought to give you  one more, and then we'd be even.\"    \"No, Dick; I wouldn't agree to that. If you insist upon it, we'll do as  you propose; but, if ever I am able, I will make it up to you.\"    \"Well, young gentleman, what have you decided?\" asked Mrs. Browning.    \"We'll take the room,\" said Dick, promptly.    \"When do you wish to commence?\"    \"To-day. We'll come this evening.\"    \"Very well. I suppose you can furnish me with references. You're in  business, I suppose?\"    \"I am in Henderson's hat and cap store, No. ---- Broadway,\" said Henry  Fosdick.    \"And I am going into Rockwell & Cooper's, on Pearl Street, next Monday,\"  said Dick, with a sense of importance. He felt that this was very  different from saying, \"I black boots in Chatham Square.\"    \"You look like good boys,\" said Mrs. Browning, \"and I've no doubt you're  honest; but I'm a widow, dependent on my boarders, and I have to be  particular. Only last week a young man went off, owing me four weeks'  board, and I don't suppose he'll ever show his face again. He got a good  salary, too; but he spent most of it on cigars and billiards. Now, how  can I be sure you will pay me your board regular?\"    \"We'll pay it every week in advance,\" said Dick, promptly. \"Them's our  best references,\" and he produced his bank-book, showing a deposit of  over one hundred dollars to his credit in the savings bank, motioning at  the same time to Fosdick to show his.    \"You don't mean to say you've saved all that from your earnings?\" said  Mrs. Browning, surprised.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"and I might have saved more if I'd begun sooner.\"    \"How long has it taken you to save it up?\"    \"About nine months. My friend hasn't saved so much, because his salary  has been smaller.\"    \"I won't require you to pay in advance,\" said Mrs. Browning, graciously.  \"I am sure I can trust you. Boys who have formed so good a habit of  saving can be depended upon. I will get the room ready for you, and you  may bring your trunks when you please. My hours are, breakfast at seven,  lunch at half-past twelve, and dinner at six.\"    \"We shan't be able to come to lunch,\" said Fosdick. \"Our stores are too  far off.\"    \"Then I will make half a dollar difference with each of you, making nine  dollars a week instead of ten.\"    The boys went downstairs, well pleased with the arrangement they had  made. Dick insisted upon paying five dollars and a half of the joint  weekly expense, leaving three and a half to Fosdick. This would leave  the latter two dollars and a half out of his salary, while Dick would  have left four and a half. With economy, both thought they could  continue to lay up something.    There was one little embarrassment which suggested itself to the boys.  Neither of them had a trunk, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21653"],[0,"The Eurhythmics of Jaques-Dalcroze (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note:      A Short Greek phrase has been transliterated and delimited      with '{}'.

Rhythmical \"gymnastics,\" in the natural meaning of the word, is a part  of the Dalcroze training, and a not unimportant part, but it is only one  application of a much wider principle; and accordingly, where the term  occurs in the following pages, it must be understood simply as denoting  a particular mode of physical drill. But for the principle itself and  the total method embodying it, another name is needed, and the term  \"Eurhythmics\" has been here coined for the purpose. The originality of  the Dalcroze method, the fact that it is a discovery, gives it a right  to a name of its own: it is because it is in a sense also the  rediscovery of an old secret that a name has been chosen of such plain  reference and derivation. Plato, in the words quoted above, has said  that the whole of a man's life stands in need of a right rhythm: and it  is natural to see some kinship between this Platonic attitude and the  claim of Dalcroze that his discovery is not a mere refinement of  dancing, nor an improved method of music-teaching, but a principle that  must have effect upon every part of life.

Jaques-Dalcroze has re-opened a door which has long been closed. He has  rediscovered one of the secrets of Greek education.    A hundred years ago Wilhelm von Humboldt endeavoured to make Greek  ideals the paramount influence in the higher schools of Germany. He and  a group of friends had long felt indignant at the utilitarianism and  shallowness of the work of the schools. In Greek literature, Greek  philosophy and Greek art would be found a means of kindling new life in  education and of giving it the power of building up strong and  independent personalities. When there came to Humboldt the unexpected  opportunity of reforming the secondary schools of Prussia, he so  remodelled the course of study as to secure for Greek thought and  letters a place which, if not central and determinative, would at least  bring the elite of the younger generation in some measure under their  influence. But his administrative orders failed to impart to the schools  the spirit of ancient Greece. To Humboldt and his friends Greek studies  had been an inspiration because, apart from their intellectual  significance and literary form, those studies had been the channel of an  artistic impulse and had been entered into as art. But this artistic  power was not felt by the greater number of those who undertook, in  obedience to the new regulations, the duty of teaching Greek in the  schools. What was left in Greek studies after this failure of artistic  insight was often no more than another form of purely intellectual  discipline. A new subject had been added to the curriculum, but new life  had not been brought into the schools. The very name, Gymnasium, which  denoted their Hellenic purpose, seemed ironical. They were not Greek in  spirit and they ignored the training of the body. Thus what Wilhelm von  Humboldt had chiefly aimed at accomplishing, he failed to do. It was not  the power of Greek art that he brought into the schools but, in most  cases, merely the philological study of a second dead language. The  cause of his failure was that he had not discovered the educational  method which could effectually secure his purpose. He had assumed that,  in order to introduce the Greek spirit into education, it was sufficient  to insist upon the linguistic and literary study of Greek.    In time, attempts were made to remedy what was defective in Humboldt's  plan by insisting upon physical exercises as an obligatory part of  education in the higher schools. But the physical exercises thus  introduced, though salutary in themselves, were divorced from the  artistic influences of the Greek gymnastic. Humboldt's chief aim had  been forgotten. His system of organization had rooted itself, but his  educational ideal, to which he attached far greater importance than to  administrative regulation, was ignored.    In later years, though such Neo-Hellenism as Humboldt's had long gone  out of fashion, the weakness of the higher schools on the side of  artistic training was recognized. But a corrective for this was sought  in instruction about art, not (except so far as a little teaching of  drawing went) in the practice of an art. An attempt was made to  cultivate aesthetic appreciation by lessons which imparted knowledge but  did not attempt to train the power of artistic production--an aim which  was regarded as unrealizable, except in vocal music, and of course  through literary composition, in a secondary school. Thus Humboldt's  original purpose has been almost wholly unachieved. The schools,  admirably organized on the intellectual side and, within certain limits,  increasingly efficient in their physical training, are, as a rule,  lacking in the influence of art, as indeed in most cases are the  corresponding schools in other countries. The spring of artistic  training has not been touched. The divorce between intellectual  discipline and artistic influence (except indeed so far as the latter is  operative through the study of literature, through a little drawing, and  through vocal music) is complete. This defect is felt even more keenly  in Germany than in England, because in the German schools the  intellectual pressure is more severe, and the schools do less for the  cultivation of those interests which lie outside the limits of regular  class-room work.    Wilhelm von Humboldt gave little direct attention to the work of the  elementary schools. His chief concern was with higher education. But in  the elementary schools also, except in so far as they gave much care to  vocal music, the course of training failed to make use of the educative  power of art. A conviction that there is an error has led in Germany, as  in England and America, to an increased attention to drawing and to  attempts to interest children in good pictures. But there is still  (except in the case of vocal music and a little drawing) an unbridged  gap between the intellectual and the artistic work of the schools.    Jaques-Dalcroze's experience suggests the possibility of a much closer  combination of these two elements, both in elementary and in secondary  education. His teaching requires from the pupils a sustained and careful  attention, is in short a severe (though not exhausting) intellectual  exercise; while at the same time it trains the sense of form and rhythm,  the capacity to analyse musical structure, and the power of expressing  rhythm through harmonious movement. It is thus a synthesis of  educational influence, artistic and intellectual. Its educational value  for young children, its applicability to their needs, the pleasure which  they take in the exercises, have been conclusively proved. And in"]]]
