CLARK, LIMITED    PUBLICATION AGENTS FOR THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND    1901          PREFACE      In preparation for this Guild Book I wrote an account of every  pre-Reformation structure in Scotland of which any remains now survive,  but the prescribed limits of the series necessitated a selection. The  Scottish cathedrals are all here treated, with representative collegiate  and monastic buildings. Reference is also made to parish churches that  represent the architecture of the various periods indicated in Chapter  II. A survey of Scottish mediaeval architecture will be found in pp.  194-206 that may enable readers to take a comprehensive view of the  whole. A study of those treated in particular will lead to a study of  those treated of necessity in general, and illustrate the idea that the  history of the Scottish Church is the history of the ideality and faith  of the Scottish people, and that the one cannot be separated from the  other.

BALLANTINE.    A Tale of the Pirates of the City of Algiers, and their Defeat by the  British Navy.    The Time of the Action is about 1817.    The Pirate City--by RM Ballantyne        CHAPTER ONE.    OPENS THE TALE.    Some time within the first quarter of the present nineteenth century, a  little old lady--some people would even have called her a dear little  old lady--sat one afternoon in a high-backed chair beside a cottage  window, from which might be had a magnificent view of Sicilian rocks,  with the Mediterranean beyond.    This little old lady was so pleasant in all respects that an adequate  description of her is an impossibility.  Her mouth was a perfect study.  It was not troubled with anything in the shape of teeth.  It lay between  a delicate little down-turned nose and a soft little up-turned chin,  which two seemed as if anxious to meet in order to protect it.  The  wrinkles that surrounded that mouth were innumerable, and each wrinkle  was a distinct and separate smile; so that, whether pursing or  expanding, it was at all times rippling with an expression of tender  benignity.    This little old lady plays no part in our tale; nevertheless she merits  passing introduction as being the grandmother of our hero, a Sicilian  youth of nineteen, who, at the time we write of, sat on a stool at her  feet engaged in earnest conversation.    \"Grandmother,\" said the youth in a perplexed mood, \"why won't you let  _me_ go into the Church instead of brother Lucien?  I'm certain that he  does not want to, though he is fit enough, as far as education goes, and  goodness; but you know well enough that he is desperately fond of  Juliet, and she is equally desperate about him, and nothing could be  more pleasant than that they should get married.\"    \"Tut, child, you talk nonsense,\" said the old lady, letting a sigh  escape from the rippling mouth.  \"Your father's dearest wish has always  been to see Lucien enter the Church, and although Juliet is our adopted  child, we do not intend to interfere with the wishes of her uncle the  abbot, who has offered to place her in the convent of Saint Shutemup.  As to you taking Lucien's place,\"--here the mouth expanded  considerably--\"ah!  Mariano, you are too foolish, too giddy; better  fitted to be a sailor or soldier I should think--\"    \"How!\" interrupted Mariano.  \"Do you then estimate the profession of the  soldier and sailor so low, that you think only foolish and giddy fellows  are fit for it?\"    \"Not so, child; but it is a school which is eminently fitted to teach  respect and obedience to foolish and giddy fellows who are pert to their  grandmothers.\"    \"Ah! how unfair,\" exclaimed Mariano, with assumed solemnity; \"I give you  good advice, with gravity equal to that of any priest, and yet you call  me pert.  Grandmother, you are ungrateful as well as unjust.  Have I not  been good to you all my life?\"    \"You have, my child,\" said the little old lady; \"very good--also rather  troublesome, especially in the way of talking nonsense, and I'm sorry to  find that although your goodness continues, your troublesomeness does  not cease!\"    \"Well, well,\" replied the youth, with a sprightly toss of the head,  \"Lucien and I shall enjoy at least a few weeks more of our old life on  the blue sea before he takes to musty books and I to the stool of the  clerk.  Ah, why did you allow father to give us a good education?  How  much more enjoyable it would have been to have lived the free life of a  fisherman--or of that pig,\" he said, pointing to one which had just  strayed into the garden and lain down to roll in the earth--\"what happy  ignorance or ignorant happiness; what concentrated enjoyment of the  present, what perfect oblivion as to the past, what obvious disregard of  the future--\"    \"Ay,\" interrupted the little old lady, \"what blissful ignorance of the  deeds of ancient heroes, of the noble achievements of great and good  men, of the adventures of Marco Polo, and Magellan, and Vasco de Gama,  over whose voyages you have so often and so fondly pored.\"    \"I see, grandmother, that it is useless to argue with you.  Let us turn  to a graver subject.  Tell me, what am I to bring you from Malta?  As  this is in very truth to be our last voyage, I must bring you something  grand, something costly.--Ah, here comes Juliet to help us to decide.\"    As he spoke a pretty dark-eyed girl of nineteen entered the room and  joined their council, but before they had gone very deep into the  question which Mariano had propounded, they were interrupted by the  entrance of the head of the house, Francisco Rimini, a strong portly man  of about fifty years of age, with a brown, healthy complexion, grizzled  locks, a bald pate, and a semi-nautical gait.  He was followed by a  stranger, and by his eldest son, Lucien--a tall, grave, slender youth of  twenty-three, who was in many respects the opposite of his brother  Mariano, physically as well as mentally.  The latter was middle-sized,  broad-shouldered, and very powerful, with short curly brown hair,  flashing eyes and sprightly disposition--active as a kitten, and rather  mischievous.  Lucien was grave, gentle, and studious; elegantly rather  than powerfully formed, and disposed rather to enjoy fun by looking on  than engaging in it.  Both brothers, as well as their father, possessed  kindly dispositions and resolute spirits.    \"Mother,\" said Francisco, \"let me introduce to you my friend Signor  Bacri, a merchant who goes in my vessel as a passenger to Malta.  He  dines with us to-day; and that reminds me that you must hasten our  dinner, as events have transpired which oblige me to set sail two hours  earlier than I had intended; so please expedite matters, Juliet.\"    The stranger bowed with Oriental dignity to the little old lady, and,  seating himself by her side, entered into conversation.    Bacri was a middle-aged man of magnificent appearance.  From the cast of  his features it was easy to perceive that he was of Jewish extraction,  and his proportions might have been compared to those of the ancient  enemy of his nation, Goliath.  Like Saul, he was a head and shoulders  higher than ordinary men, yet he evidently placed no confidence in his  physical strength, for although his countenance was grave and his  expression dignified, he stooped a good deal, as though to avoid  knocking his head against ceilings and beams, and was singularly humble  and unobtrusive in his manners.  There was a winning softness, too, in  his voice and in his smile, which went far to disarm that distrust of,  and antipathy to, his race which prevailed in days of old, and  unfortunately prevails still, to some extent, in Christendom.    With the activity of a good housewife, Juliet expedited the operations  of the cook; dinner was served in good time; Francisco, who was owner of  his vessel and cargo, as well as padrone or captain, entertained Bacri  with accounts of his adventures on the sea, which the Jew returned in  kind with his experiences of mercantile transactions in savage lands.  Mariano drank in all that they said with youthful avidity, and the  little old lady's mouth rippled responsive, like the aspen leaf to the  breeze; while Lucien and Juliet, thus left to themselves, had no other  resource than to entertain each other as best they could!    Then the adieux were said, the voyagers went down to the port, embarked  on board their good ship--a trim-built schooner--and set sail with a  fair wind.    \"I wish I saw them all safe back again!\" said the little old lady, with  a sigh.    Juliet said nothing, though she echoed the sigh.    Meanwhile the schooner leant over to the breeze, and ere night-fall left  the shores of Sicily far behind.        CHAPTER TWO.    UNFOLDS A LITTLE OF THE TALE.    Another and a very different vessel chanced to be floating in those seas  at the time the Sicilian trader set sail.  At a distance she might have  been mistaken for a fishing-boat, for she carried only two lateen sails,  of that high triangular form which may still be seen in the  Mediterranean and on the lakes of Switzerland.  In reality, however, the  vessel was of greater dimensions than even the largest boat, and her  main-mast with its sail was of gigantic proportions.  She was also  full-decked, and several pieces of heavy ordnance pointed their black  muzzles from port-holes in her bulwarks.    No one could have mistaken her character as a vessel of war, for,  besides the guns referred to, she had an unusually large crew of bronzed  and stalwart men.  Their costume, as well as their arms, told that these  were of Eastern origin.  Although there was much variety in detail, they  all wore the same gold-laced jackets, the same loose Turkish drawers  gathered in below the knees, and broad silken scarfs round their waists,  with richly chased silver-mounted pistols and yataghans or curved  swords.  Some wore the turban, others the blue-tasselled red fez or  tarbouch of Tunis, while a few contented themselves with a kerchief tied  loosely round their heads.    One, who appeared to be the captain of the vessel, stood near the  steersman, leaning on the bulwarks, and scanning the horizon with a  telescope.  His costume was similar to that of his men, but of richer  material.    \"It is certainly a sail,\" said he whom we have styled the captain to one  who stood by his side, and might have been his lieutenant or mate.    \"She bears sou'-west, I think,\" replied the latter.    \"So much the better,\" returned the captain; \"let her fall off a little--  so, steady.  If this wind holds for half an hour we shall get well  abreast of her, and then--\"    The captain shut up the telescope with an emphatic bang, by way of  termination to his remark, and, turning on his heel, paced the deck  rapidly by the side of his mate.    \"We have been unlucky hitherto,\" he observed; \"perchance fortune may  change and now be favourable.  At all events, we"]]]
