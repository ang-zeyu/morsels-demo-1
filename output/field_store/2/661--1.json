Told, we must imagine, by the  watch, we are led through the owner's days at a boys' boarding school,  to being stolen, pawned, auctioned, taken to quite another small town,  given to a brilliant local boy when he left for Cambridge, lost in a  field, found, and through further adventures being taken to India to  fight in a battle near Lucknow, finally making its way into the pocket  of its original owner, whose life was saved by the watch having  deflected a bullet.    It's well-told, too, and not too long, at under ten hours.    The copy we worked from was very browned, and it was not too easy to do  the transcription, but we have done our best: if you find anything  obviously wrong, don't hesitate to tell us about it.

MY INFANCY AND EDUCATION--HOW I WAS SOLD AND WHO BOUGHT ME.    \"Then you can guarantee it to be a good one to go?\"    \"You couldn't have a better, sir.\"    \"And it will stand a little roughish wear, you think?\"    \"I'm sure of it, sir; it's an uncommon strong watch.\"    \"Then I'll take it.\"    These few sentences determined my destiny, and from that moment my  career may be said to have begun.    I am old, and run down, and good for nothing now; but many a time do I  find my thoughts wandering back to this far-off day; and remembering all  that has befallen me since that eventful moment, I humbly hope my life  has not been one to disgrace the good character with which I went out  into the world.    I was young at the time, very young--scarcely a month old.  Watches  however, as every one knows, are a good deal more precocious in their  infancy than human beings.  They generally settle down to business as  soon as they are born, without having to spend much of their time either  in the nursery or the schoolroom.    Indeed, after my face and hands had once been well cleaned, and a brand-  new shiny coat had been put on my back, it was years before I found  myself again called upon to submit to that operation which is such a  terror to all mortal children.    As to my education, it lasted just a week; and although I am bound to  say, while it lasted, it was both carefully and skilfully managed, I did  not at all fancy the discipline I was subjected to in the process.  I  used to be handed over to a creature who took me up and examined me (as  if he were a policeman and a magistrate combined), and according as I  answered his questions he exclaimed, \"You're going too fast,\" or \"You're  going too slow,\" and with that he set himself to \"regulate\" me, as he  called it.  I was ordered to turn round, take off my coat, and submit my  poor shoulders to his instrument of correction.  But why need I describe  this experience to boys?  They know what \"regulating\" means as well as I  do!    Well in due time I profited by the instructions received, and one day my  tutor, after the usual examination, grumpily told me, \"You're right at  last; you can go.\"  And I did go, and I've been going ever since.    The troubles of my infancy however were not all over.  I discovered at a  very early age that the one thing a watch is never allowed to do is to  go to sleep.  They'd as soon think of leaving an infant to starve as of  letting a watch go to sleep.    But to my story.  Ever since I had left school--or, in other words, gone  through my due course of regulation--I had remained shut up under a  glass-case, lying comfortably upon a bed of purple velvet, and decorated  with a little white label bearing the mysterious inscription, \"Only  Three Guineas.\"  From this stately repose I was only once a day  disturbed in order to be kept from sleeping, and had all the rest of my  time to look about me and observe what went on in the world in which I  found myself.    It was not a big world indeed, but I could see I was not the only  inhabitant.  All around me were watches like myself, some of a golden  complexion, and some--of which I was one--of a silvery.  Some were big,  and made an awful noise, and some were tiny, and just whispered what  they had to say.  Some were very proud, and showed off their jewels and  chains in a way which made me blush for the vanity of my fellow-  creatures--\"dear\" watches, the ladies called these, and others were as  plain as plain could be.    Every now and then our case would be opened, and one of my neighbours  taken out and never put back.  Then we knew he had been sold, and we who  were left spent our time in gossiping about what had become of him, and  speculating whose turn would come next.  A gold repeater near me was  very confident the turn would be his, and so impressed us with the sense  of his \"striking\" importance and claims, that when the next time our  glass house was entered, and a hand came groping in our direction, I at  once concluded it was his summons into publicity and honour.  Imagine my  astonishment, then, when the hand, instead of reaching my gold  neighbour, took hold of me and cautiously drew me out of the case!  My  heart leaped to my mouth--or whatever part of a watch's anatomy  corresponds with that organ--and I was ready to faint with excitement.  I had always imagined I was to lie in that case for years, but now, when  I was barely a month old, here was I going out into the world.    It made me quite bashful to listen to all the flattering things my  master said of me.  I was worth twice the price he was selling me at, he  said; in fact, if trade had been good he would not have parted with me  under three times that price.  It was a relief to think the repeater  could not overhear this, or he would have sneered in a way to extinguish  me altogether.  As it was, no other watch was by, so that I was not very  much embarrassed.    After turning me over, and feeling my pulse, and listening to the  beating of my heart, and taking off my coat and waistcoat to inspect my  muscle, my master's customer at last laid me down on the counter and  pronounced the sentences with which I have begun my story.    \"Then I'll take it,\" he said, and pulled out his purse.  \"Stop a bit,  though!\" exclaimed he; \"I'd better have a chain too, my little chap will  think more of that than the watch.  Let me see some silver chains, will  you?\"    So my master went and fetched a tray containing a large number of  tempting-looking chains.    While he was gone my new owner took me up again in his hand and turned  me over and put me to his ear; then as he laid me down again he smiled  to himself and murmured.    \"Bless his little heart! how proud he'll be!\"    I was quite taken aback.  Who was this taking upon himself to bless my  little heart and prophesy that I should be proud?  Then all of a sudden  it occurred to me this remark may have been intended to refer not to me,  but to the \"little chap\" the gentleman had just now spoken of.  So I  recovered my composure, especially when I saw what a kind, gentle face  my purchaser had.    He chose a neat, strong silver chain which was forthwith, in accordance  with the barbarous practice of the age, fixed to my poor neck.  I could  not help sighing as I felt for the first time the burden of bondage.    What had I done to be thus chained like a Roman captive, like a dog,  like a parrot?  But it was no use being in a rage.  I swallowed my  indignation as well as I could, and consoled myself with the reflection  that every watch, even gold repeaters themselves, are subject to the  same hardship.    Ah!  I was young then, and my knowledge of the world was small.  Many a  time since I have blessed the chain that held me, just as the ship,  could it speak, would bless the cable that saved it from the rocks.  Take the advice of an old ticker, you young watches, and instead of  rebelling against your chains, rather hope they may be strong and sound  in every link!    \"That will be just five pounds, won't it?\" said my purchaser.  \"Here is  a bank note.  Never mind about doing it up, I'll just slip it into my  pocket.  Good-morning.\"    And with that I was conscious of being lowered into a dark, deep pit,  and without time to bid my comrades good-bye, or to take a last look at  my old master, I felt myself hurried away I knew not whither.    This, then, was my first step into the world.    I lay untouched and apparently forgotten for several hours.  Gradually  getting my eyes accustomed to the darkness, and looking about me as far  as I was able, I heard a ticking going on in a pocket not very far from  the one I was in, which I at once concluded to proceed from the watch of  my new master.  Thinking I might be able to gain some information from  him, I groped about till I found a small hole in my lodgings through  which I was able to peep, and call.    \"Tick!\" said I, as loud as I could, to secure the attention of my  fellow-watch.    \"Who's that?\" at once exclaimed the other.    \"I'm a new watch, bought to-day.\"    \"Humph!  How much?\"    \"Three guineas.\"    \"Chain and all?\"    \"No; five pounds with the chain.\"    \"Humph, I cost thirty guineas.  Never mind, you're for the boy.\"    \"What boy?\"    \"The governor's.  I heard him say he was going to get him one.  That boy  will be spoiled, as sure as I go on springs; he's made such a lot of.  Have you been regulated?\"    \"I should think I have!\" exclaimed I, in indignant recollection of my  education.    \"All right; keep your temper.  What time are you?\"    \"Seven minutes to six.\"    \"Wrong!  It's seven and three-quarters!\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"Because that's what I make it.\"    \"How do you know you are right?\"  I asked, wondering at my own impudence  in thus questioning an old ticker.    \"Look here, young fellow,\" said the other in an awful voice; \"you don't  seem to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#1)"],[1,"Friend Smith  A Story of School and City Life    By Talbot Baines Reed  ________________________________________________________________________  This is a curious book by the author.  It does not surprise us, because  it has a long school-life section, but then it goes on to describe in  rather frightening detail the life of a young clerk in London, trying to  survive on a miserable pittance, living in a cheap lodging-house, and  trying to keep up socially with his contemporaries.  He is loyal to his  friends, and in particular to his friend Smith, whom he had met at  school, which had been a school for troublesome and backward boys.    I think it rings very true.  There is a foreword which is as  enthusiastic as I am about the book.  It still gives you a lot to think  about.  It was quite a true image even when I was young myself and  trying to make my way in London, and from what I hear of the  tribulations of the young, it is probably not far from the truth today.    Read the book yourself and see what you think.  NH.  ________________________________________________________________________  MY FRIEND SMITH  A STORY OF SCHOOL AND CITY LIFE    BY TALBOT BAINES REED        CHAPTER ONE.    HOW I CAME TO BE SENT TO STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.    \"It was perfectly plain, Hudson, the boy could not be allowed to remain  any longer a disgrace to the neighbourhood,\" said my uncle.    \"But, sir,\" began my poor old nurse.    \"That will do, Hudson,\" said my uncle, decisively; \"the matter is  settled--Frederick is going to Stonebridge House on Monday.\"    And my uncle stood up, and taking a coat-tail under each arm,  established himself upon the hearthrug, with his back to Mrs Hudson.  That was always a sign there was no more to be said; and off I was  trotted out of the dreaded presence, not very sure whether to be elated  or depressed by the conversation I had overheard.    And indeed I never was quite clear as to why, at the tender and  guileless age of twelve, I was abruptly sent away from my native village  of Brownstroke, to that select and popular \"Academy for Backward and  Troublesome Young Gentlemen,\" (so the advertisement ran), known as  Stonebridge House, in the neighbourhood of Cliffshire.    Other people appeared to divine the reason, and Mrs Hudson shook her  head and wiped her eyes when I consulted her on the subject.  It was  queer.  \"I must be a very backward boy,\" thought I to myself, \"for try  as I will, I don't see it.\"    You must know I was an orphan.  I never could recollect my mother--nor  could Mrs Hudson.  As to my father, all I could recall of him was that  he had bushy eyebrows, and used to tell me some most wonderful stories  about lions and tigers and other beasts of prey, and used now and then  to show me my mother's likeness in a locket that hung on his watch-  chain.  They were both dead, and so I came to live with my uncle.  Now,  I could hardly tell why, but it never seemed to me as if my uncle  appeared to regard it as a privilege to have me to take care of.  He  didn't whack me as some fellows' uncles do, nor did he particularly  interfere with my concerns, as the manner of other uncles (so I am  told), is.  He just took as little notice as possible of me, and as long  as I went regularly to Mrs Wren's grammar-school in the village, and as  long as Mrs Hudson kept my garments in proper order, and as long as I  showed up duly on state occasions, and didn't bring more than a square  inch of clay on each heel (there was a natural affinity between clay and  my heels), into his drawing-room, he scarcely seemed to be aware that  his house possessed such a treasure as an only nephew.    The part of my life I liked least was the grammar-school.  That was a  horrid place.  Mrs Wren was a good old soul, who spent one half of her  time looking over her spectacles, and the other half under them, for  something she never found.  We big boys--for twelve is a good age for a  dame's grammar-school--we didn't exactly get on at old Jenny Wren's, as  she was called.  For we gradually discovered we knew almost as much as  she did herself, and it dawned on us by degrees that somehow she didn't  know how to keep us in order.  The consequence was, one or two boys,  especially Jimmy Bates, the parish clerk's son, and Joe Bobbins, the  Italian oil and colourman's son, didn't behave very well.  I was sorry  to see it, and always told them so.    They got us other boys into all sorts of scrapes and trouble.  One day  they would hide poor Jenny's spectacles, and then when search was made  the lost treasure would be found in some one else's desk.  Or they would  tie cotton reels on the four feet and tail of the old tabby cat, and  launch her, with a horrid clatter, right into the middle of the room,  just as I or one of the others happened to be scampering out.  Or they  would turn the little boys' forms upside down, and compel them with  terrible threats to sit on the iron feet, and then in the middle of the  class \"sneak\" about them.    Poor Jenny couldn't manage the school at all, with such boys as Jimmy  Bates and Joe Bobbins in it.  Up to boys of ten she was all right; but  over ten she was all at sea.    However, she worked patiently on, and taught us all she could, and once  or twice gave us a horrible fright by calling up at our houses, and  reporting progress there (Mrs Hudson always received her when she came  up to my uncle's).  And for all I know I might be at Jenny Wren's school  still if a tremendous event hadn't happened in our village, which  utterly upset the oldest established customs of Brownstroke.    We grammar-school boys never \"hit\" it exactly with the other town boys.  Either they were jealous of us or we were jealous of them.  I don't  know, but we hated the town boys, and they hated us.    Once or twice we had come into collision, though they always got the  best of it.  One winter they snowballed us to such a pitch that as long  as the snow was on the ground a lot of the little kids would no more  venture to school alone than a sane man would step over the side of a  balloon.    Another time they lined the street down both sides, and laughed and  pointed at us as we walked to school.  That was far worse than  snowballs, even with stones in them.  You should have seen us, with pale  faces and hurried steps, making our way amid the jeers and gibes of our  tormentors--some of the little ones blubbering, one or two of the bigger  ones looking hardly comfortable, and a few of the biggest inwardly  ruminating when and how it would best be possible to kill that Runnit  the news-boy, or Hodge the cow-boy!    These and many other torments and terrors we \"Jenny Wrenites\" had  endured at the hands of our enemies the town boys, on the whole  patiently.  In process of time they got tired of one sort of torment,  and before their learned heads had had time to invent a new one, we had  had time to muster up courage and tell one another we didn't care what  they did.    Such a period had occurred just before my story opens.  It was a whole  month since the town boys had made our lives unhappy by calling, and  howling, and yelling, and squeaking on every occasion they met us the  following apparently inoffensive couplet:--    \"A, B, C, Look at the baby!\"    How we hated that cry, and quailed when we heard it!  However, after  about a fortnight's diligent use of this terrible weapon the town boys  subsided for a season, and we plucked up heart again.  Four whole weeks  passed, and we were never once molested!  Something must be wrong in the  village!  Of course we all came to the conclusion that the town boys had  at last seen the error of their ways, and were turning over new leaves.    Rash dream!  One day when we were least expecting it, the \"Philistines  were upon us\" again, and this time their device was to snatch off our  caps!  It was too terrible to think of!  We could endure to be hooted  at, and pelted, and said \"A, B, C\" to, but to have our little Scotch  caps snatched off our heads and tossed over pailings and into puddles,  was too much even for the meek disciples of Jenny Wren.  The poor little  boys got their mothers to fasten elastics to go under their chins, and  even so walked nearly half a mile round to avoid the market cross.  It  was no use, the manoeuvre was discovered, and not only did the  youngsters have their caps taken, but were flipped violently by the  elastics in the face and about the ears in doing so.  As for us older  ones, some ran, other walked with their caps under their tunics, others  held them on with both hands.  The result was the same; our caps were  captured!    Then did Jimmy Bates, and Joe Bobbins, and Harry Rasper, and I, meet one  day, and declare to one another, that this sort of thing was not to be  stood.    \"Let's tell Mother Wren,\" said one.    \"Or the policeman,\" said another.    \"Let's write and tell Fred Batchelor's uncle,\" said another.  That  referred to my relative, who was always counted a \"nob\" in the village.    \"I say, don't do any,\" said the redoubtable Bobbins.  \"The next time  they do it to me _I_ mean to kick!\"    The sentiment was loudly applauded, and a regular council of war was  held, with the following decision.  We four were to go home together  that afternoon, and without waiting to be chased, would ourselves give  chase to the first bully we saw, and take _his_ cap!  The consequences  of course might be fearful--fatal; but the blood of the \"Jenny Wrenites\"  was up.  Do it we would, or perish in the attempt.    I think we all got a little nervous as the afternoon school wore on and  the hour for departing approached.  Indeed, when we were about to start,  Bates looked very like deserting straight away.    \"Oh, you three go on,\" he said, \"I'll catch you up; I just want to speak  to Jenny.\"    \"No we don't,\" we all protested; \"we'll wait here, if it takes you till  midnight to say what you've got to say to Jenny.\"    This valiant"]]]
