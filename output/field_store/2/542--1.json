CONTENTS      Baha'i Terms of Use  Part One  Part Two  Part Three              PART ONE      Herein Follow the Tablets and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha    All-praise To Him Who, by the Shield of His Covenant, hath guarded the  Temple of His Cause from the darts of doubtfulness, Who by the Hosts of  His Testament hath preserved the Sanctuary of His most Beneficent Law and  protected His Straight and Luminous Path, staying thereby the onslaught of  the company of Covenant-breakers, that have threatened to subvert His  Divine Edifice; Who hath watched over His Mighty Stronghold and  All-Glorious Faith, through the aid of men whom the slander of the  slanderer affect not, whom no earthly calling, glory and power can turn  aside from the Covenant of God and His Testament, established firmly by  His clear and manifest words, writ and revealed by His All-Glorious Pen  and recorded in the Preserved Tablet.    Salutation and praise, blessing and glory rest upon that primal branch of  the Divine and Sacred Lote-Tree, grown out, blest, tender, verdant and  flourishing from the Twin Holy Trees; the most wondrous, unique and  priceless pearl that doth gleam from out the Twin surging seas; upon the  offshoots of the Tree of Holiness, the twigs of the Celestial Tree, they  that in the Day of the Great Dividing have stood fast and firm in the  Covenant; upon the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God that have diffused  widely the Divine Fragrances, declared His Proofs, proclaimed His Faith,  published abroad His Law, detached themselves from all things but Him,  stood for righteousness in this world, and kindled the Fire of the Love of  God in the very hearts and souls of His servants; upon them that have  believed, rested assured, stood steadfast in His Covenant and followed the  Light that after my passing shineth from the Dayspring of Divine  Guidance--for behold! he is the blest and sacred bough that hath branched  out from the Twin Holy Trees. Well is it with him that seeketh the shelter  of his shade that shadoweth all mankind.    O ye beloved of the Lord! The greatest of all things is the protection of  the True Faith of God, the preservation of His Law, the safeguarding of  His Cause and service unto His Word. Ten thousand souls have shed streams  of their sacred blood in this path, their precious lives they offered in  sacrifice unto Him, hastened wrapt in holy ecstasy unto the glorious field  of martyrdom, upraised the Standard of God's Faith and writ with their  life-blood upon the Tablet of the world the verses of His Divine Unity.  The sacred breast of His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my life be a  sacrifice unto Him), was made a target to many a dart of woe, and in  Mazindaran, the blessed feet of the Abha Beauty (may my life be offered up  for His loved ones) were so grievously scourged as to bleed and be sore  wounded. His neck also was put into captive chains and His feet made fast  in the stocks. In every hour, for a period of fifty years, a new trial and  calamity befell Him and fresh afflictions and cares beset Him. One of  them: after having suffered intense vicissitudes, He was made homeless and  a wanderer and fell a victim to still new vexations and troubles. In  'Iraq, the Day-Star of the world was so exposed to the wiles of the people  of malice as to be eclipsed in splendor. Later on He was sent an exile to  the Great City (Constantinople) and thence to the Land of Mystery  (Adrianople), whence, grievously wronged, He was eventually transferred to  the Most Great Prison (Akka). He Whom the world hath wronged (may my life  be offered up for His loved ones) was four times banished from city to  city, till at last, condemned to perpetual confinement, He was  incarcerated in this prison, the prison of highway robbers, of brigands  and of man-slayers. All this is but one of the trials that have afflicted  the Blessed Beauty, the rest being even as grievous as this.    And still another of His trials was the hostility, the flagrant injustice,  the iniquity and rebellion of Mirza Yahya. Although that Wronged One, that  Prisoner, had through His loving-kindness nurtured him in His own bosom  ever since his early years, had showered at every moment His tender care  upon him, exalted his name, shielded him from every misfortune, endeared  him to them of this world and the next, and despite the firm exhortations  and counsels of His Holiness, the Exalted One (the Bab) and His clear and  conclusive warning;--\"Beware, beware, lest the Nineteen Letters of the  Living and that which hath been revealed in the Bayan veil thee!\" yet  notwithstanding this, Mirza Yahya denied Him, dealt falsely with Him,  believed Him not, sowed the seeds of doubt, closed his eyes to His  manifest verses and turned aside therefrom. Would that he had been content  therewith! Nay, he even attempted to shed the sacred blood (of  Baha'u'llah) and then raised a great clamor and tumult around him,  attributing unto Baha'u'llah malevolence and cruelty towards himself. What  sedition he stirred up and what a storm of mischief he raised whilst in  the Land of Mystery (Adrianople)! At last, he wrought that which caused  the Day-Star of the world to be sent an exile to this, the Most Great  Prison, and sorely wronged, and in the West of this Great Prison He did  set.    O ye that stand fast and firm in the Covenant! The Center of Sedition, the  Prime Mover of mischief, Mirza Muhammad 'Ali, hath passed out from under  the shadow of the Cause, hath broken the Covenant, hath falsified the Holy  Text, hath inflicted a grievous loss upon the true Faith of God, hath  scattered His people, hath with bitter rancor endeavored to hurt  'Abdu'l-Baha and hath assailed with the utmost enmity this servant of the  Sacred Threshold. Every dart he seized and hurled to pierce the breast of  this wronged servant, no wound did he neglect to grievously inflict upon  me, no venom did he spare but he poisoned therewith the life of this  hapless one. I swear by the most holy Abha Beauty and by the Light shining  from His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my soul be a sacrifice for Their  lowly servants), that because of this iniquity the dwellers in the  Pavilion of the Abha Kingdom have bewailed, the Celestial Concourse is  lamenting, the Immortal Maids of Heaven in the All-Highest Paradise have  raised their plaintive cries and the angelic company sighed and uttered  their moanings. So grievous the deeds of this iniquitous person became  that he struck with his axe at the root of the Blessed Tree, dealt a heavy  blow at the Temple of the Cause of God, deluged with tears of blood the  eyes of the loved ones of the Blessed Beauty, cheered and encouraged the  enemies of the One True God, by his repudiation of the Covenant turned  many a seeker after Truth aside from the Cause of God, revived the  blighted hopes of Yahya's following, made himself detested, caused the  enemies of the Greatest Name to become audacious and arrogant, put aside  the firm and conclusive verses and sowed the seeds of doubt. Had not the  promised aid of the Ancient Beauty been graciously vouchsafed at every  moment to this one, unworthy though he be, he surely would have destroyed,  nay exterminated the Cause of God and utterly subverted the Divine  Edifice. But, praised be the Lord, the triumphant assistance of the Abha  Kingdom was received, the hosts of the Realm above hastened to bestow  victory. The Cause of God was promoted far and wide, the call of the True  One was noised abroad, ears in all regions were inclined to the Word of  God, His standard was unfurled, the ensigns of Holiness gloriously waved  aloft and the verses celebrating His Divine Unity were chanted. Now, that  the true Faith of God may be shielded and protected, His Law guarded and  preserved and His Cause remain safe and secure, it is incumbent upon  everyone to hold fast unto the Text of the clear and firmly established  blessed verse, revealed about him. None other transgression greater than  his can be ever imagined. He (Baha'u'llah) sayeth, glorious and holy is  His Word:--\"My foolish loved ones have regarded him even as my partner,  have kindled sedition in the land and they verily are of the  mischief-makers.\" Consider, how foolish are the people! They that have  been in His (Baha'u'llah's) Presence and beheld His Countenance, have  nevertheless noised abroad such idle talk, until, exalted be His explicit  words, He said:--\"Should he for a moment pass out from under the shadow of  the Cause, he surely shall be brought to naught.\" Reflect! What stress He  layeth upon one moment's deviation: that is, were he to incline a hair's  breadth to the right or to the left, his deviation would be clearly  established and his utter nothingness "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#1)"],[1,"Traveler's Narrative      by 'Abdu'l-Baha          Edition 1, (September 2006)                                       BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.

CONTENTS      Baha'i Terms of Use  A TRAVELER'S NARRATIVE WRITTEN TO ILLUSTRATE THE EPISODE OF THE BAB     [Pages 1-20]     [Pages 21-40]     [Pages 41-60]     [Pages 61-80]     [Pages 81-94]              A TRAVELER'S NARRATIVE WRITTEN TO ILLUSTRATE THE EPISODE OF THE BAB          [Pages 1-20]      Touching the individual known as the Bab and the true nature of this sect  diverse tales are on the tongues and in the mouths of men, and various  accounts are contained in the pages of Persian history and the leaves of  European chronicles. But because of the variety of their assertions and  the diversity of their narratives not one is as worthy of confidence as it  should be. Some have loosed their tongues in extreme censure and  condemnation; some foreign chronicles have spoken in a commendatory  strain; while a certain section have recorded what they themselves have  heard without addressing themselves either to censure or approbation.    Now since these various accounts are recorded in other pages, and since  the setting forth thereof would lead to prolixity, therefore what relates  to the history of this matter (sought out with the utmost diligence during  the time of my travels in all parts of Persia, whether far or near, from  those without and those within, from friends and strangers), and that  whereon the disputants are agreed, shall be briefly set forth in writing,  so that a summary of the facts of the case may be at the disposal of those  who are athirst after the fountain of knowledge and who seek to become  acquainted with all events.    The Bab was a young merchant of the Pure Lineage. He was born in the year  one thousand two hundred and thirty-five [A.H.] on the first day of  Muharram,(1) and when after a few years His father Siyyid Muhammad-Rida  died, He was brought up in _Sh_iraz in the arms of His maternal uncle  Mirza Siyyid 'Ali the merchant. On attaining maturity He engaged in trade  in Bu_sh_ihr, first in partnership with His maternal uncle and afterwards  independently. On account of what was observed in Him He was noted for  godliness, devoutness, virtue, and piety, and was regarded in the sight of  men as so characterized.    In the year one thousand two hundred and sixty [A.H.], when He was in His  twenty-fifth year, certain signs became apparent in His conduct, behavior,  manners, and demeanor whereby it became evident in _Sh_iraz that He had  some conflict in His mind and some other flight beneath His wing. He began  to speak and to declare the rank of Bab-hood.(2) Now what He intended by  the term Bab [Gate] was this, that He was the channel of grace from some  great Person still behind the veil of glory, Who was the possessor of  countless and boundless perfections, by Whose will He moved, and to the  bond of Whose love He clung. And in the first book which He wrote in  explanation of the Surih of Joseph,(3) He addressed Himself in all  passages to that Person unseen from Whom He received help and grace,  sought for aid in the arrangement of His preliminaries, and craved the  sacrifice of life in the way of His love.    Amongst others is this sentence: \"O Remnant of God, I am wholly sacrificed  to Thee; I am content with curses in Thy way; I crave naught but to be  slain in Thy love; and God the Supreme sufficeth as an Eternal  Protection.\"    He likewise composed a number of works in explanation and elucidation of  the verses of the Qur'an, of sermons, and of prayers in Arabic; inciting  and urging men to expect the appearance of that Person; and these books He  named \"Inspired Pages\" and \"Word of Conscience.\" But on investigation it  was discovered that He laid no claim to revelation from an angel.    Now since He was noted amongst the people for lack of instruction and  education, this circumstance appeared in the sight of men supernatural.  Some men inclined to Him, but the greater part manifested strong  disapproval; whilst all the learned doctors and lawyers of repute who  occupied chairs, altars, and pulpits were unanimously agreed on  eradication and suppression, save some divines of the _Sh_ay_kh_i party  who were anchorites and recluses, and who, agreeably to their tenets, were  ever seeking for some great, incomparable, and trustworthy person, whom  they accounted, according to their own terminology, as the \"Fourth  Support\" and the central manifestation of the truths of the Perspicuous  Religion.    Of this number Mulla Husayn of Bu_sh_ruyih, Mirza Ahmad of Az_gh_and,  Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas [the Holy], _Sh_ay_kh_ Abu-Turab of I_sh_tihard,  Mulla Yusuf of Ardibil, Mulla Jalil of Urumiyyih, Mulla Mihdi of Kand,  _Sh_ay_kh_ Sa'id the Indian, Mulla 'Ali of Bastam, and the like of these  came out unto Him and spread themselves through all parts of Persia.    The Bab Himself set out to perform the circumambulation of the House of  God.(4) On His return, when the news of His arrival at Bu_sh_ihr reached  _Sh_iraz, there was much discussion, and a strange excitement and  agitation became apparent in that city. The great majority of the doctors  set themselves to repudiate Him, decreeing slaughter and destruction, and  they induced Husayn _Kh_an Ajudan-ba_sh_i, who was the governor of Fars,  to inflict a beating on the Bab's missionaries, that is on Mulla Sadiq  Muqaddas; then, having burnt his moustaches and beard together with those  of Mirza Muhammad-'Ali of Barfuru_sh_ and Mulla 'Ali-Akbar of Ardistan,  they put halters on all the three and led them round the streets and  bazaars.    Now since the doctors of Persia have no administrative capacity, they  thought that violence and interference would cause extinction and silence  and lead to suppression and oblivion; whereas interference in matters of  conscience causes stability and firmness and attracts the attention of  men's sight and souls; which fact has received experimental proof many  times and often. So this punishment caused notoriety, and most men fell to  making inquiry.    The governor of Fars, acting according to that which the doctors deemed  expedient, sent several horsemen, caused the Bab to be brought before him,  censured and blamed Him in the presence of the doctors and scholars, and  loosed his tongue in the demand for reparation. And when the Bab returned  his censure and withstood him greatly, at a sign from the president they  struck Him a violent blow, insulting and contemning Him, in such wise that  His turban fell from His head and the mark of the blow was apparent on His  face. At the conclusion of the meeting they decided to take counsel, and,  on receiving bail and surety from His maternal uncle Haji Siyyid 'Ali,  sent Him to His house forbidding Him to hold intercourse with relations or  strangers.    One day they summoned Him to the mosque urging and constraining Him to  recant, but He discoursed from the pulpit in such wise as to silence and  subdue those present and to stablish and strengthen His followers. It was  then supposed that He claimed to be the medium of grace from His Highness  the Lord of the Age (upon Him be peace); but afterwards it became known  and evident that His meaning was the Gatehood [Babiyyat] of another city  and the mediumship of the graces of another Person Whose qualities and  attributes were contained in His books and treatises.    At all events, as has been mentioned, by reason of the doctors' lack of  experience and skill in administrative science, and the continual  succession of their decisions, comment was rife; and their interference  with the Bab cast a clamor throughout Persia, causing increased ardor in  friends and the coming forward of the hesitating. For by reason of these  occurrences men's interest increased, and in all parts of Persia some [of  God's] servants inclined toward Him, until the matter acquired such  importance that the late king Muhammad _Sh_ah delegated a certain person  named Siyyid Yahya of Darab, who was one of the best known of doctors and  Siyyids as well as an object of veneration and confidence, giving him a  horse and money for the journey so that he might proceed to _Sh_iraz and  personally investigate this matter.(5)    When the above-mentioned Siyyid arrived at _Sh_iraz he interviewed the Bab  three times. In the first and second conferences questioning and answering  took place; in the third conference he requested a commentary on the Surih  called Kaw_th_ar(6) , and when the Bab, without thought or reflection,  wrote an elaborate commentary on the Kaw_th_ar in his presence, the  above-mentioned Siyyid was charmed and enraptured with Him, and  straightway, without consideration for the future or anxiety about the  results of this affection, hastened to Burujird to his father Siyyid  Ja'far, known as Ka_sh_fi, and acquainted him with the matter.
