Appleton And Company  Copyright, 1906, 1916, by  D. Appleton and Company  Printed in the United States of America              PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION      Authors, no doubt, are always gratified when their works find favorable  acceptance. The writer of this text has been doubly gratified, however,  at the cordial reception and widespread use accorded to the present  volume. This feeling does not arise from any narrow personal pride or  selfish interest, but rather from the fact that the warm approval of the  educational public has proved an important point; namely, that the  fundamental truths of psychology, when put simply and concretely, can be  made of interest and value to students of all ages from high school  juniors up, and to the general public as well. More encouraging still,  it has been demonstrated that the teachings of psychology can become  immediately helpful, not only in study or teaching, but also in business  or profession, in the control and guidance of the personal life, and in  the problems met in the routine of the day's work or its play.    In effecting the present revision, the salient features of the original  edition have been kept. The truths presented are the most fundamental  and important in the field of psychology. Disputed theories and  unsettled opinions are excluded. The subject matter is made concrete and  practical by the use of many illustrations and through application to  real problems. The style has been kept easy and familiar to facilitate  the reading. In short, there has been, while seeking to improve the  volume, a conscious purpose to omit none of the characteristics which  secured acceptance for the former edition.    On the other hand, certain changes and additions have been made which,  it is believed, will add to the strength of the work. First of all, the  later psychological studies and investigations have been drawn upon to  insure that the matter shall at all points be abreast of the times in  scientific accuracy. Because of the wide use of the text in the training  of teachers, a more specific educational application to schoolroom  problems has been made in various chapters. Exercises for the guidance  of observation work and personal introspection are freely used. The  chapter on Sensation and Perception has been separated into two  chapters, and each subject given more extensive treatment. A new chapter  has been added on Association. The various chapters have been subdivided  into numbered sections, and cut-in paragraph topics have been used to  facilitate the study and teaching of the text. Minor changes and  additions occur throughout the volume, thus adding some forty pages to  the number in the original edition.    Many of the modifications made in the revision are due to valuable  suggestions and kindly criticisms received from many teachers of the  text in various types of schools. To all who have thus helped so  generously by freely giving the author the fruits of their judgment and  experience he gladly renders grateful thanks.    CORNELL COLLEGE,    IOWA.

NELSON ROBINSON JR. PROFESSOR OF ARCHITECTURE                  IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY                       CAMBRIDGE                HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS                LONDON: HUMPHREY MILFORD                OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS                         1914          COPYRIGHT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS           *       *       *       *       *          PREFACE      During the last years of his life, Professor Morgan had devoted much  time and energy to the preparation of a translation of Vitruvius, which  he proposed to supplement with a revised text, illustrations, and notes.  He had completed the translation, with the exception of the last four  chapters of the tenth book, and had discussed, with Professor Warren,  the illustrations intended for the first six books of the work; the  notes had not been arranged or completed, though many of them were  outlined in the manuscript, or the intention to insert them indicated.  The several books of the translation, so far as it was completed, had  been read to a little group of friends, consisting of Professors Sheldon  and Kittredge, and myself, and had received our criticism, which had, at  times, been utilized in the revision of the work.    After the death of Professor Morgan, in spite of my obvious incompetency  from a technical point of view, I undertook, at the request of his  family, to complete the translation, and to see the book through the  press. I must, therefore, assume entire responsibility for the  translation of the tenth book, beginning with chapter thirteen, and  further responsibility for necessary changes made by me in the earlier  part of the translation, changes which, in no case, affect any theory  held by Professor Morgan, but which involve mainly the adoption of  simpler forms of statement, or the correction of obvious oversights.    The text followed is that of Valentine Rose in his second edition  (Leipzig, 1899), and the variations from this text are, with a few  exceptions which are indicated in the footnotes, in the nature of a  return to the consensus of the manuscript readings.    The illustrations in the first six books are believed to be  substantially in accord with the wishes of Professor Morgan. The  suggestions for illustrations in the later books were incomplete, and  did not indicate, in all cases, with sufficient definiteness to allow  them to be executed, the changes from conventional plans and designs  intended by the translator. It has, therefore, been decided to include  in this part of the work only those illustrations which are known to  have had the full approval of Professor Morgan. The one exception to  this principle is the reproduction of a rough model of the Ram of  Hegetor, constructed by me on the basis of the measurements given by  Vitruvius and Athenaeus.    It does not seem to me necessary or even advisable to enter into a long  discussion as to the date of Vitruvius, which has been assigned to  various periods from the time of Augustus to the early centuries of our  era. Professor Morgan, in several articles in the _Harvard Studies in  Classical Philology_, and in the _Proceedings of the American Academy_,  all of which have been reprinted in a volume of _Addresses and Essays_  (New York, 1909), upheld the now generally accepted view that Vitruvius  wrote in the time of Augustus, and furnished conclusive evidence that  nothing in his language is inconsistent with this view. In revising the  translation, I met with one bit of evidence for a date before the end of  the reign of Nero which I have never seen adduced. In viii, 3, 21, the  kingdom of Cottius is mentioned, the name depending, it is true, on an  emendation, but one which has been universally accepted since it was  first proposed in 1513. The kingdom of Cottius was made into a Roman  province by Nero (cf. Suetonius, _Nero_, 18), and it is inconceivable  that any Roman writer subsequently referred to it as a kingdom.    It does seem necessary to add a few words about the literary merits of  Vitruvius in this treatise, and about Professor Morgan's views as to the  general principles to be followed in the translation.    Vitruvius was not a great literary personage, ambitious as he was to  appear in that character. As Professor Morgan has aptly said, \"he has  all the marks of one unused to composition, to whom writing is a painful  task.\" In his hand the measuring-rod was a far mightier implement than  the pen. His turgid and pompous rhetoric displays itself in the  introductions to the different books, where his exaggerated effort to  introduce some semblance of style into his commonplace lectures on the  noble principles which should govern the conduct of the architect, or  into the prosaic lists of architects and writers on architecture, is  everywhere apparent. Even in the more technical portions of his work, a  like conscious effort may be detected, and, at the same time, a lack of  confidence in his ability to express himself in unmistakable language.  He avoids periodic sentences, uses only the simpler subjunctive  constructions, repeats the antecedent in relative clauses, and, not  infrequently, adopts a formal language closely akin to that of  specifications and contracts, the style with which he was, naturally,  most familiar. He ends each book with a brief summary, almost a formula,  somewhat like a sigh of relief, in which the reader unconsciously  shares. At times his meaning is ambiguous, not because of grammatical  faults, which are comparatively few and unimportant, but because, when  he does attempt a periodic sentence, he becomes involved, and finds it  difficult to extricate himself.    Some of these peculiarities and crudities of expression Professor Morgan  purposely imitated, because of his conviction that a translation should  not merely reproduce the substance of a book, but should also give as  clear a picture as possible of the original, of its author, and of the  working of his mind. The translation is intended, then, to be faithful  and exact, but it deliberately avoids any attempt to treat the language  of Vitruvius as though it were Ciceronian, or to give a false impression  of conspicuous literary merit in a work which is destitute of that  quality. The translator had, however, the utmost confidence in the  sincerity of Vitruvius and in the serious purpose of his treatise on  architecture.    To those who have liberally given their advice and suggestions in  response to requests from Professor Morgan, it is impossible for me to  make adequate acknowledgment. Their number is so great, and my knowledge  of the indebtedness in individual cases is so small, that each must be  content with the thought of the full and generous acknowledgment which  he would have received had Professor Morgan himself written this  preface.    Personally I am under the greatest obligations to Professor H. L.  Warren, who has freely given both assistance and criticism; to Professor  G. L. Kittredge, who has read with me most of the proof; to the Syndics  of the Harvard University Press, who have made possible the publication  of the work; and to the members of the Visiting Committee of the  Department of the Classics and the classmates of Professor Morgan, who  have generously supplied the necessary funds for the illustrations.
