The houses are immensely high, painted in all sorts of  colors, and are in every stage and state of damage, dirt, and lack of  repair. They are commonly let off in floors, or flats, like the houses  in the old town of Edinburgh, or many houses in Paris....    When shall I forget the Streets of Palaces: the Strada Nuova and the  Strada Baldi! The endless details of these rich palaces; the walls of  some of them, within, alive with masterpieces by Vandyke! The great,  heavy, stone balconies, one above another, and tier over tier; with here  and there, one larger than the rest, towering high up--a huge marble  platform; the doorless vestibules, massively barred lower windows,  immense public staircases, thick marble pillars, strong dungeon-like  arches, and dreary, dreaming, echoing vaulted chambers; among which the  eye wanders again, and again, and again, as every palace is succeeded by  another--the terrace gardens between house and house, with green arches  of the vine, and groves of orange-trees, and blushing oleander in full  bloom, twenty, thirty, forty feet above the street--the painted halls,  moldering and blotting, and rotting in the damp corners, and still  shining out in beautiful colors and voluptuous designs, where the walls  are dry--the faded figures on the outsides of the houses, holding  wreaths, and crowns, and flying upward, and downward, and standing in  niches, and here and there looking fainter and more feeble than  elsewhere, by contrast with some fresh little Cupids, who on a more  recently decorated portion of the front, are stretching out what seems  to be the semblance of a blanket, but is, indeed, a sun-dial--the steep,  steep, up-hill streets of small palaces (but very large palaces for all  that), with marble terraces looking down into close by-ways--the  magnificent and innumerable churches; and the rapid passage from a  street of stately edifices, into a maze of the vilest squalor, steaming  with unwholesome stenches, and swarming with half-naked children and  whole worlds of dirty people--make up, altogether, such a scene of  wonder; so lively, and yet so dead; so noisy, and yet so quiet; so  obtrusive, and yet so shy and lowering; so wide-awake, and yet so fast  asleep; that it is a sort of intoxication to a stranger to walk on, and  on, and on, and look about him. A bewildering phantasmagoria, with all  the inconsistency of a dream, and all the pain and all the pleasure of  an extravagant reality!...    In the streets of shops, the houses are much smaller,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#1)"],[1,"STORIES    GRIMM          [Illustration: THE SLEEPING BEAUTY         \"--AT LAST HE CAME TO THE       TOWER & OPENED THE DOOR       OF THE LITTLE ROOM WHERE       ROSAMOND LAY.\"]          HOUSEHOLD  STORIES,  FROM  THE COLLECTION OF THE BROS:  GRIMM:    TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN  BY  LUCY CRANE;  AND  DONE INTO PICTURES  BY  WALTER CRANE    DOVER  PUBLICATIONS, INC.

At  last said the woman to her daughter,    \"Go into the garden, and drive out the rabbit.\"    \"Shoo! shoo!\" said the maiden; \"don't eat up all our cabbages, little  rabbit!\"    \"Come, maiden,\" said the rabbit, \"sit on my tail and go with me to my  rabbit-hutch.\" But the maiden would not.
