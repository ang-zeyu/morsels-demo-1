III--JANUARY, 1918--No. 1          THE STORY OF JOSIAH HENSON[1]      No one ever uttered a more forceful truth than Frederika Bremer when  she said in speaking to Americans: \"The fate of the Negro is the  romance of your history.\" The sketches of heroes showing the life of  those once exploited by Christian men must ever be interesting to  those who would know the origin and the development of a civilization  distinctly American. In no case is this more striking than in that of  Josiah Henson, the man who probably was present to Harriet Beecher  Stowe's mind when she graphically portrayed slavery in writing \"Uncle  Tom's Cabin.\"    Josiah Henson was born June 15, 1789, on a farm in Charles County,  Maryland, where his mother was hired out. His parents had six  children. The only recollection he had of his father was that of  seeing his right ear cut off, his head gashed and his back lacerated,  as a result of the cruel punishment inflicted upon him because he had  dared to beat the overseer of the plantation for brutally assaulting  the slave's wife. Because of becoming morose, disobedient and  intractable thereafter, Henson's father was sold to a planter in  Alabama and his relatives never heard of him again. His mother was  then brought back to the estate of her owner, a Doctor McPherson, who  was much kinder to his slaves. Dr. McPherson gave the youth his own  name, Josiah, and the family name Henson after Dr. McPherson's uncle,  who served in the Revolutionary War. Josiah showed signs of mental and  religious development under the pious care of his Christian mother and  for that reason became his master's favorite.    Upon the death of Doctor McPherson, however, it became necessary to  sell the estate and slaves to divide his property among his heirs. The  Henson family was then scattered throughout the country and worst of  all Josiah was separated from his mother, notwithstanding his mother's  earnest entreaty that her new master, Isaac Riley, should also  purchase her baby. Instead of listening to the appeal of this  afflicted woman clinging to his hands, he disengaged himself from her  with violent blows. She was then taken to Riley's farm in Montgomery  County. Josiah was purchased by a man named Robb, a tavern keeper  living near Montgomery Court-House. Both masters were unusually cruel,  in keeping with the tyrannical methods employed by planters of that  time. Because of ill health resulting from the lack of proper care,  Josiah became very sickly. He was then providentially restored to his  mother, having been offered to her owner by Robb for a small sum, for  the reason that it was thought that he would die.    His third master was \"vulgar in his habits, unprincipled and cruel in  his general deportment and especially addicted to the vice of  licentiousness.\"[2] On his plantation Henson served as water-boy,  butler and finally as a field hand, experiencing the usual hardship of  the slave. He ate twice a day of cornmeal and salt herring, with a  little buttermilk and a few vegetables occasionally. His dress was  first a single garment, something like a long shirt reaching to the  ankles, later a pair of trousers and a shirt with the addition of a  woolen hat once in two or three years and a round jacket or overcoat  in the winter time. He slept with ten or a dozen persons in a log hut  of a single small room, with no other floor than the trodden earth,  and without beds or furniture. In spite of this, however, Henson grew  to be a robust lad, who at the age of fifteen could do a man's work.  Having too more mental capacity than most slaves, he was regarded as a  smart fellow. Hearing remarks like this about himself, Henson became  filled with ambition and pride, and aspired to a position of influence  among his fellows.    At times Henson would toil and induce his fellow slaves to work much  harder and longer than required to obtain from their master a kind  word or act, but these efforts usually produced no more from their  owner than a cold calculation of the value of Josiah to him. When,  however, the white overseer of this plantation was discharged for  stealing from his employer, Josiah had shown himself so capable that  he was made manager of the plantation. In this position his honest  management of the estate made him indispensable to his master also as  a salesman of produce in the markets of Georgetown and Washington. He  had during these years come under the influence of an anti-slavery  white man of Georgetown and had become a devout Christian with  considerable influence as a preacher among the slaves.    About this time, Josiah was serving his master in another capacity,  which brought upon him one of the greatest misfortunes of his life.  This was accompanying his master to town for protection and  deliverance when the owners of his order indulged in excessive  drinking and brawls in taverns. Sometimes in removing his master from  the midst of a fracas, he would have to handle his owner's opponent  rather roughly. On one occasion when Riley became involved in a  quarrel with his brother's overseer, Henson pushed the overseer down;  and falling while intoxicated the overseer suffered some injury. The  overseer decided to wreak vengeance on Henson for this. Finding  Henson on the way home one day the overseer assisted by three Negroes  attacked him, beating him unmercifully and left him on the ground  almost senseless with his head badly bruised and cut and with his  right arm and both shoulder blades broken. Being on a farm where no  physician or surgeon was usually called, Henson recovered with  difficulty under the kind treatment of his master's sister; but was  never able thereafter to raise his hands to his head. The culprit did  not suffer for this offense, as the court acquitted him on the grounds  of self-defense.    In the course of time Henson's master, Isaac Riley, lived so  extravagantly that he became involved in debt and lawsuits which  heralded his ruin. Seeing his estate would be seized, he intrusted to  Henson in 1825 the tremendous task of taking his 18 slaves to his  brother, Amos Riley, in Kentucky. Henson bought a one-horse wagon to  carry provisions and to relieve the women and children from time to  time. The men were compelled to walk altogether. Traveling through  Alexandria, Culpepper, Fauquier, Harper's Ferry and Cumberland, they  met on the way droves of Negroes passing in chains under the system of  the internal slave trade, while those whom Henson was conducting were  moving freely without restriction. On arriving at Wheeling, he sold  the horse and wagon and bought a boat of sufficient size to take the  whole party down the river. At Cincinnati some free Negroes came out  to greet them and urged them to avail themselves of the opportunity to  become free. Few of the slaves except Henson could appreciate this  boon offered them, but he had thought of obtaining it only by  purchase. Henson said: \"Under the influence of these impressions, and  seeing that the allurements of the crowd were producing a manifest  effect, I sternly assumed the captain, and ordered the boat to be  pushed off into the stream. A shower of curses followed me from the  shore; but the Negroes under me, accustomed to obey, and, alas! too  degraded and ignorant of the advantages of liberty to know what they  were forfeiting, offered no resistance to my command.\" \"Often since  that day,\" says he, \"has my soul been pierced with bitter anguish at  the thought of having been thus instrumental in consigning to the  infernal bondage of slavery so many of my fellow-beings. I have  wrestled in prayer with God for forgiveness. Having experienced myself  the sweetness of liberty, and knowing too well the after misery of a  great majority of them, my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose.

Certain it is, at least, that to the  Greeks, masters in all great arts, we owe this habit. They made such  collections and named them, after their pleasant imaginative fashion,  a gathering of flowers, or what we, borrowing their word, call an  anthology. So to those austere souls who regard anthologies as a  labor-saving contrivance for the benefit of persons who like a  smattering of knowledge and are never really learned, we can at least  plead in mitigation that we have high and ancient authority for the  practise. In any event no amount of scholarly deprecation has been  able to turn mankind or that portion of mankind which reads books from  the agreeable habit of making volumes of selections and finding in  them much pleasure, as well as improvement in taste and knowledge.  With the spread of education and with the great increase of literature  among all civilized nations, more especially since the invention of  printing and its vast multiplication of books, the making of volumes  of selections comprizing what is best in one's own or in many  literatures is no longer a mere matter of taste or convenience as with  the Greeks, but has become something little short of a necessity in  this world of many workers, comparatively few scholars, and still  fewer intelligent men of leisure. Anthologies have been multiplied  like all other books, and in the main they have done much good and no  harm. The man who thinks he is a scholar or highly educated because he  is familiar with what is collected in a well-chosen anthology, of  course, errs grievously. Such familiarity no more makes one a master  of literature than a perusal of a dictionary makes the reader a master  of style. But as the latter pursuit can hardly fail to enlarge a man's  vocabulary, so the former adds to his knowledge, increases his stock  of ideas, liberalizes his mind and opens to him new sources of  enjoyment.    The Greek habit was to bring together selections of verse, passages  of especial merit, epigrams and short poems. In the main their example  has been followed. From their days down to the \"Elegant Extracts in  Verse\" of our grandmothers and grandfathers, and thence on to our own  time with its admirable \"Golden Treasury\" and \"Oxford Handbook of  Verse,\" there has been no end to the making of poetical anthologies  and apparently no diminution in the public appetite for them. Poetry  indeed lends itself to selection. Much of the best poetry of the world  is contained in short poems, complete in themselves, and capable of  transference bodily to a volume of selections. There are very few  poets of whose quality and genius a fair idea can not be given by a  few judicious selections. A large body of noble and beautiful poetry,  of verse which is \"a joy forever,\" can also be given in a very small  compass. And the mechanical attribute of size, it must be remembered,  is very important in making a successful anthology, for an essential  quality of a volume of selections is that it should be easily  portable, that it should be a book which can be slipt into the pocket  and readily carried about in any wanderings whether near or remote.  An anthology which is stored in one or more huge and heavy volumes is  practically valueless except to those who have neither books nor  access to a public library, or who think that a stately tome printed  on calendered paper and \"profusely illustrated\" is an ornament to a  center-table in a parlor rarely used except on solemn or official  occasions.    I have mentioned these advantages of verse for the purposes of an  anthology in order to show the difficulties which must be encountered  in making a prose selection. Very little prose is in small parcels  which can be transferred entire, and therefore with the very important  attribute of completeness, to a volume of selections. From most of the  great prose writers it is necessary to take extracts, and the chosen  passage is broken off from what comes before and after. The fame of a  great prose writer as a rule rests on a book, and really to know him  the book must be read and not merely passages from it. Extracts give  no very satisfactory idea of \"Paradise Lost\" or \"The Divine Comedy,\"  and the same is true of extracts from a history or a novel. It is  possible by spreading prose selections through a series of small  volumes to overcome the mechanical difficulty and thus make the  selections in form what they ought above all things to be--companions  and not books of reference or table decorations. But the spiritual or  literary problem is not so easily overcome. What prose to take and  where to take it are by no means easy questions to solve. Yet they are  well worth solving, so far as patient effort can do it, for in this  period of easy printing it is desirable to put in convenient form  before those who read examples of the masters which will draw us back  from the perishing chatter of the moment to the literature which is  the highest work of civilization and which is at once noble and  lasting.    Upon that theory this collection has been formed. It is an attempt to  give examples from all periods and languages of Western civilization  of what is best and most memorable in their prose literature. That the  result is not a complete exhibition of the time and the literatures  covered by the selections no one is better aware than the editors.  Inexorable conditions of space make a certain degree of incompleteness  inevitable when he who is gathering flowers traverses so vast a  garden, and is obliged to confine the results of his labors within  such narrow bounds. The editors are also fully conscious that, like  all other similar collections, this one too will give rise to the  familiar criticism and questionings as to why such a passage was  omitted and such another inserted; why this writer was chosen and that  other passed by. In literature we all have our favorites, and even the  most catholic of us has also his dislikes if not his pet aversions. I  will frankly confess that there are authors represented in these  volumes whose writings I should avoid, just as there are certain towns  and cities of the world to which, having once visited them, I would  never willingly return, for the simple reason that I would not  voluntarily subject myself to seeing or reading what I dislike or,  which is worse, what bores and fatigues me. But no editor of an  anthology must seek to impose upon others his own tastes and opinions.  He must at the outset remember and never afterward forget that so far  as possible his work must be free from the personal equation. He must  recognize that some authors who may be mute or dull to him have a  place in literature, past or present, sufficiently assured to entitle  them to a place among selections which are intended above all things  else to be representative.    To those who wonder why some favorite bit of their own was omitted  while something else for which they do not care at all has found a  place I can only say that the editors, having supprest their own  personal preferences, have proceeded on certain general principles  which seem to be essential in making any selection either of verse or  prose which shall possess broader and more enduring qualities than  that of being a mere exhibition of the editor's personal taste. To  illustrate my meaning: Emerson's \"Parnassus\" is extremely interesting  as an exposition of the tastes and preferences of a remarkable man of  great and original genius. As an anthology it is a failure, for it is  of awkward size, is ill arranged and contains selections made without  system, and which in many cases baffle all attempts to explain their  appearance. On the other hand, Mr. Palgrave, neither a very remarkable  man nor a great and original genius, gave us in the first \"Golden  Treasury\" a collection which has no interest whatever as reflecting  the tastes of the editor, but which is quite perfect in its kind.  Barring the disproportionate amount of Wordsworth which includes some  of his worst things--and which, be it said in passing, was due to Mr.  Palgrave's giving way at that point to his personal enthusiasm--the  \"Golden Treasury\" in form, in scope, and in arrangement, as well as in  almost unerring taste, is the best model of what an anthology should  be which is to be found in any language.    Returning now to our questioner who misses some favorite and finds  something else which he dislikes, the only answer, as I have just  said, is that the collection is formed on certain general principles,  as any similar collection of the sort must be.
