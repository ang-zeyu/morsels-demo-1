IVES          THE BIBLIOTAPH AND OTHER PEOPLE          THE BIBLIOTAPH: A PORTRAIT NOT WHOLLY IMAGINARY      A popular and fairly orthodox opinion concerning  book-collectors is that their vices are many, their virtues of a  negative sort, and their ways altogether past finding out. Yet the  most hostile critic is bound to admit that the fraternity of  bibliophiles is eminently picturesque. If their doings are  inscrutable, they are also romantic; if their vices are numerous, the  heinousness of those vices is mitigated by the fact that it is  possible to sin humorously. Regard him how you will, the sayings and  doings of the collector give life and color to the pages of those  books which treat of books. He is amusing when he is purely an  imaginary creature. For example, there was one Thomas Blinton. Every  one who has ever read the volume called _Books and Bookmen_ knows  about Thomas Blinton. He was a man who wickedly adorned his volumes  with morocco bindings, while his wife 'sighed in vain for some old  _point d'Alencon lace_.' He was a man who was capable of bidding  fifteen pounds for a Foppens edition of the essays of Montaigne,  though fifteen pounds happened to be 'exactly the amount which he owed  his plumber and gas-fitter, a worthy man with a large family.' From  this fictitious Thomas Blinton all the way back to Richard Heber, who  was very real, and who piled up books as other men heap together  vulgar riches, book-collectors have been a picturesque folk.    The name of Heber suggests the thought that all men who buy books are  not bibliophiles. He alone is worthy the title who acquires his  volumes with something like passion. One may buy books like a  gentleman, and that is very well. One may buy books like a gentleman  and a scholar, which counts for something more. But to be truly of the  elect one must resemble Richard Heber, and buy books like a gentleman,  a scholar, and a madman.    You may find an account of Heber in an old file of _The Gentleman's  Magazine_. He began in his youth by making a library of the classics.  Then he became interested in rare English books, and collected them  _con amore_ for thirty years. He was very rich, and he had never given  hostages to fortune; it was therefore possible for him to indulge his  fine passion without stint. He bought only the best books, and he  bought them by thousands and by tens of thousands. He would have held  as foolishness that saying from the Greek which exhorts one to do  nothing too much. According to Heber's theory, it is impossible to  have too many good books. Usually one library is supposed to be enough  for one man. Heber was satisfied only with eight libraries, and then  he was hardly satisfied. He had a library in his house at Hodnet. 'His  residence in Pimlico, where he died, was filled, like Magliabecchi's  at Florence, with books from the top to the bottom; every chair, every  table, every passage containing piles of erudition.' He had a house in  York Street which was crowded with books. He had a library in Oxford,  one at Paris, one at Antwerp, one at Brussels, and one at Ghent. The  most accurate estimate of his collections places the number at 146,827  volumes. Heber is believed to have spent half a million dollars for  books. After his death the collections were dispersed. The catalogue  was published in twelve parts, and the sales lasted over three years.    Heber had a witty way of explaining why he possessed so many copies of  the same book. When taxed with the sin of buying duplicates he replied  in this manner: 'Why, you see, sir, no man can comfortably do without  _three_ copies of a book. One he must have for his show copy, and he  will probably keep it at his country house; another he will require  for his own use and reference; and unless he is inclined to part with  this, which is very inconvenient, or risk the injury of his best copy,  he must needs have a third at the service of his friends.'    In the pursuit of a coveted volume Heber was indefatigable. He was not  of those Sybaritic buyers who sit in their offices while agents and  dealers do the work. 'On hearing of a curious book he has been known  to put himself into the mail-coach, and travel three, four, or five  hundred miles to obtain it, fearful to trust his commission to a  letter.' He knew the solid comfort to be had in reading a book  catalogue. Dealers were in the habit of sending him the advance sheets  of their lists. He ordered books from his death-bed, and for anything  we know to the contrary died with a catalogue in his fingers.    A life devoted to such a passion is a stumbling-block to the  practical man, and to the Philistine foolishness. Yet you may hear men  praised because up to the day of death they were diligent in  business,--business which added to life nothing more significant than  that useful thing called money. Thoreau used to say that if a man  spent half his time in the woods for the love of the woods he was in  danger of being looked upon as a loafer; but if he spent all his time  as a speculator, shearing off those woods and making Earth bald before  her time, he was regarded as an upright and industrious citizen.    Heber had a genius for friendship as well as for gathering together  choice books. Sir Walter Scott addressed verses to him. Professor  Porson wrote emendations for him in his favorite copy of _Athenaeus_.  To him was inscribed Dr. Ferrier's poetical epistle on Bibliomania.  His virtues were celebrated by Dibdin and by Burton. In brief, the  sketch of Heber in The_ Gentleman's Magazine_ for January, 1834,  contains a list of forty-six names,--all men of distinction by birth,  learning, or genius, and all men who were proud to call Richard Heber  friend. He was a mighty hunter of books. He was genial, scholarly,  generous. Out-of-door men will be pleased to know that he was active  physically. He was a tremendous walker, and enjoyed tiring out his  bailiff by an all-day tramp.    Of many good things said of him this is one of the best: 'The learned  and curious, whether rich or poor, have always free access to his  library.' Thus was it possible for Scott very truthfully to say to  Heber, 'Thy volumes open as thy heart.'    No life of this Prince of Book-Hunters has been written, I believe.  Some one with access to the material, and a sympathy with the love of  books as books, should write a memoir of Heber the Magnificent. It  ought not to be a large volume, but it might well be about the size of  Henry Stevens's _Recollections of James_ _Lenox_. And if it were  equally readable it were a readable book indeed.    Dibdin thought that Heber's tastes were so catholic as to make it  difficult to classify him among hunters of books. The implication is  that most men can be classified. They have their specialties. What  pleases one collector much pleases another but little or not at all.  Collectors differ radically in the attitude they take with respect to  their volumes. One man buys books to read, another buys them to gloat  over, a third that he may fortify them behind glass doors and keep the  key in his pocket. Therefore have learned words been devised to make  apparent the varieties of motive and taste. These words begin with  _biblio_; you may have a _biblio_ almost anything.    Two interesting types of maniac are known respectively as the  bibliotaph and the biblioclast. A biblioclast is one who indulges  himself in the questionable pleasure of mutilating books in order more  sumptuously to fit out a particular volume. The disease is English in  origin, though some of the worst cases have been observed in America.  Clergymen and presidents of colleges have been known to be seized with  it. The victim becomes more or less irresponsible, and presently runs  mad. Such an one was John Bagford, of diabolical memory, who mutilated  not less than ten thousand volumes to form his vast collection of  title-pages. John Bagford died an unrepentant sinner, lamenting with  one of his later breaths that he could not live long enough to get  hold of a genuine Caxton and rip the initial page out of that.    The bibliotaph buries books; not literally, but sometimes with as much  effect as if he had put his books underground. There are several  varieties of him. The dog-in-the-manger bibliotaph is the worst; he  uses his books but little himself, and allows others to use them not  at all. On the other hand, a man may be a bibliotaph simply from  inability to get at his books. He may be homeless, a bachelor, a  denizen of boarding-houses, a wanderer upon the face of the earth. He  may keep his books in storage or accumulate them in the country,  against the day when he shall have a town house with proper library.    The most genial lover of books who has walked city streets for many a  day was a bibliotaph.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on  this publication was renewed.          Got a problem? Just pick up the phone.  It solved them all--and all the same way!           2       B       R       0       2       B      by KURT VONNEGUT, JR.          Everything was perfectly swell.    There were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no  poverty, no wars.    All diseases were conquered. So was old age.    Death, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.    The population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million  souls.    One bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward  K. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man  waiting. Not many people were born a day any more.    Wehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average  age was one hundred and twenty-nine.    X-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The  children would be his first.    Young Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so  rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His  camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and  demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the  walls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.    The room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial  to a man who had volunteered to die.    A sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder,  painting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when people aged  visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five or so. Aging had  touched him that much before the cure for aging was found.    The mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women  in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings,  sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.    Men and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that  were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners.    Never, never, never--not even in medieval Holland nor old Japan--had a  garden been more formal, been better tended. Every plant had all the  loam, light, water, air and nourishment it could use.    A hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a  popular song:         If you don't like my kisses, honey,       Here's what I will do:       I'll go see a girl in purple,       Kiss this sad world toodle-oo.       If you don't want my lovin',       Why should I take up all this space?       I'll get off this old planet,       Let some sweet baby have my place.    The orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. \"Looks so real,\"  he said, \"I can practically imagine I'm standing in the middle of it.\"    \"What makes you think you're not in it?\" said the painter. He gave a  satiric smile. \"It's called 'The Happy Garden of Life,' you know.\"    \"That's good of Dr. Hitz,\" said the orderly.           *       *       *       *       *    He was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a  portrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Hitz  was a blindingly handsome man.    \"Lot of faces still to fill in,\" said the orderly. He meant that the  faces of many of the figures in the mural were still blank. All blanks  were to be filled with portraits of important people on either the  hospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of  Termination.    \"Must be nice to be able to make pictures that look like something,\"  said the orderly.    The painter's face curdled with scorn. \"You think I'm proud of this  daub?\" he said. \"You think this is my idea of what life really looks  like?\"    \"What's your idea of what life looks like?\" said the orderly.    The painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. \"There's a good picture of  it,\" he said. \"Frame that, and you'll have a picture a damn sight more  honest than this one.\"    \"You're a gloomy old duck, aren't you?\" said the orderly.    \"Is that a crime?\" said the painter.    The orderly shrugged. \"If you don't like it here, Grandpa--\" he said,  and he finished the thought with the trick telephone number that people  who didn't want to live any more were supposed to call. The zero in the  telephone number he pronounced \"naught.\"    The number was: \"2 B R 0 2 B.\"    It was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful sobriquets  included: \"Automat,\" \"Birdland,\" \"Cannery,\" \"Catbox,\" \"De-louser,\"  \"Easy-go,\" \"Good-by, Mother,\" \"Happy Hooligan,\" \"Kiss-me-quick,\" \"Lucky  Pierre,\" \"Sheepdip,\" \"Waring Blendor,\" \"Weep-no-more\" and \"Why Worry?\"    \"To be or not to be\" was the telephone number of the municipal gas  chambers of the Federal Bureau of Termination.           *       *       *       *       *    The painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. \"When I decide it's time to  go,\" he said, \"it won't be at the Sheepdip.\"    \"A do-it-yourselfer, eh?\" said the orderly. \"Messy business, Grandpa.  Why don't you have a little consideration for the people who have to  clean up after you?\"    The painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for the  tribulations of his survivors. \"The world could do with a good deal more  mess, if you ask me,\" he said.    The orderly laughed and moved on.    Wehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising his head.  And then he fell silent again.    A coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels.  Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple,  the purple the painter called \"the color of grapes on Judgment Day.\"    The medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service  Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a  turnstile.    The woman had a lot of facial hair--an unmistakable mustache, in fact. A  curious thing about gas-chamber hostesses was that, no matter how lovely  and feminine they were when recruited, they all sprouted mustaches  within five years or so.    \"Is this where I'm supposed to come?\" she said to the painter.    \"A lot would depend on what your business was,\" he said. \"You aren't  about to have a baby, are you?\"    \"They told me I was supposed to pose for some picture,\" she said. \"My  name's Leora Duncan.\" She waited.    \"And you dunk people,\" he said.    \"What?\" she said.    \"Skip it,\" he said.    \"That sure is a beautiful picture,\" she said. \"Looks just like heaven or  something.\"    \"Or something,\" said the painter. He took a list of names from his smock  pocket. \"Duncan, Duncan, Duncan,\" he said, scanning the list. \"Yes--here  you are. You're entitled to be immortalized. See any faceless body here  you'd like me to stick your head on? We've got a few choice ones left.\"    She studied the mural bleakly. \"Gee,\" she said, \"they're all the same to  me. I don't know anything about art.\"    \"A body's a body, eh?\" he said. \"All righty. As a master of fine art, I  recommend this body here.\" He indicated a faceless figure of a woman who  was carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner.    \"Well,\" said Leora Duncan, \"that's more the disposal people, isn't it? I  mean, I'm in service. I don't do any disposing.\"    The painter clapped his hands in mock delight. \"You say you don't know  anything about art, and then you prove in the next breath that you know  more about it than I do! Of course the sheave-carrier is wrong for a  hostess! A snipper, a pruner--that's more your line.\" He pointed to a  figure in purple who was sawing a dead branch from an apple tree. \"How  about her?\" he said. \"You like her at all?\"    \"Gosh--\" she said, and she blushed and became humble--\"that--that puts  me right next to Dr. Hitz.\"    \"That upsets you?\" he said.    \"Good gravy, no!\" she said. \"It's--it's just such an honor.\"    \"Ah, You... you admire him, eh?\" he said.    \"Who doesn't admire him?\" she said, worshiping the portrait of Hitz. It  was the portrait of a tanned, white-haired, omnipotent Zeus, two hundred  and forty years old. \"Who doesn't admire him?\" she said again. \"He was  responsible for setting up the very first gas chamber in Chicago.\"    \"Nothing would please me more,\" said the painter, \"than to put you next  to him for all time. Sawing off a limb--that strikes you as  appropriate?\"    \"That is kind of like what I do,\" she said. She was demure about what  she did. What she did was make people comfortable while she killed them.           *       *       *       *       *    And, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the  waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he  boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living.    \"Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!\" he said, and he made a joke. \"What  are you doing here?\" he said. \"This isn't where the people leave. This  is where they come in!\"    \"We're going to be in the same picture together,\" she said shyly.    \"Good!\" said Dr. Hitz heartily. \"And, say, isn't that some picture?\"    \"I sure am honored to be in it with you,\" she said.    \"Let me tell you,\" he said, \"I'm honored to be in it with you. Without  women like you, this wonderful world we've got wouldn't be possible.\"    He saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the delivery rooms.  \"Guess what was just born,\" he said.    \"I can't,\" she said.    \"Triplets!\" he said.    \"Triplets!\" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of  triplets.    The law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of  the child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if  they were all to live, called for three volunteers.    \"Do the parents have three volunteers?\" said Leora Duncan.    \"Last I heard,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"they had one, and were trying to scrape  another two up.\"    \"I don't think they made it,\" she said. \"Nobody made three"]]]
