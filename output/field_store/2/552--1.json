I. JUNE, 1895. No. 6.    RENAISSANCE PANELS FROM PERUGIA.      The carved walnut panels from the choir stalls of the Church of San  Pietro de' Casinense in Perugia, designed by Stefano da Bergamo in 1535,  which are given as illustrations in this number, are excellent examples  of the ornament of the later period of the Italian Renaissance. This  form of ornament was first used in flat painted panels upon pilasters,  such as the well-known work of Raphael in the Loggia of the Vatican,  suggested by the Roman work discovered in his time upon the Palatine. It  was afterwards applied to all sorts of objects where rectangular spaces  were to be decorated. Its characteristics can hardly be better described  than in the following extract from Mr. C. Howard Walker's articles upon  the Study of Decoration in _The Technology Architectural Review_:--    \"The motives on the pilasters were of two kinds: the continuous scroll,  starting from a strong base leaf and rising in equal volutes, with  alternating direction to right and to left, and filling the panel. This  motive needed always to be balanced by its opposite, and was  consequently seldom used. It had its prototype in the magnificent scroll  from the Forum of Trajan. The other motive was that usually used, and  capable of infinite variety, that of a central axis, the ornament  diverging from it symmetrically on either side. This motive was borrowed  from colored decorations on the Roman walls. It is a most difficult  class of ornament to handle, as so much depends upon relative  distribution, proportion, and relief of modeling. The motive usually  starts at the bottom and grows continuously to the top, with the base,  whether a mass of leafage, a vase, or other unit of ornament, well  defined and the crowning unit strong and rich. The central axis can be  actual or merely evidenced by the symmetry of the sides, preferably  actual. To prevent an effect of absolute perpendicular division or of  stringiness, this axis, between its base and crown, is divided either by  knots of ornament, concentrated masses, or horizontal motives. In making  these divisions the rules of cadence need to be carefully observed; the  divisions should be made equal in length, or alternate, or in sequence,  and the same method should be observed in the units of ornament marking  the divisions. In most cases there is more ground than ornament, which  always demands that the lines of the ornament should be most carefully  studied, and that the units used as terminals for these lines should be  exactly disposed, in relation to the axis, to each other, and to the  border of the panel. When one considers the number of factors which can  enter into the composition of one of these panels, it can be readily  conceived that their variety is wellnigh infinite; absolute symmetry on  either side of a central axis on which are threaded units of ornament,  and which starts from a mass of detail and terminates in a mass of  detail; systems of radial lines diverging from the central axis and  terminating in centres of ornaments of greater or less size, arranged in  all sorts of groupings; garlands, pendants, and ribbons, vases,  trophies, shields, birds, beasts, and nondescript combinations, foliage,  conventional and natural, forms, human and superhuman, all in varying  scales, all in surfaces undulating, now rising into sharp relief with  clear-cut edges, now sinking and melting into the background; and the  whole so carefully balanced, so exactly distributed, that no portion  should be too strong for another, no detail but should be equally  refined. It is not an easy matter to succeed in a design of such  requirements.\"    \"It is well into the latter part of the fifteenth century before this  pilaster treatment is prevalent. The Quattrocento work contains much  less of it than the Cinquecento. The garlands and trophies, lions' and  bulls' heads, dolphins and griffins, tridents and shells and rosettes,  and numberless familiar forms appear in a new guise; the new forms  being, for the most part, heraldic motives or town arms, such as the  fleur-de-lis of Florence, the Biscione or viper of Milan, and lions  which are rampant, a condition unknown to their classic prototypes.  Shields, though used before, have a new form, and ribbons are developed  into all sorts of knots and waving ends, the loops having the same  cadences in relative size as other decorative compound motives.\"          [Illustration: XLI. Panel from the Choir Stalls, Church of S. Pietro,  Perugia, Italy.]    [Illustration: XLII. Panel from the Choir Stalls, Church of S. Pietro,  Perugia, Italy.]    [Illustration: XLIII.

Panels from the Choir Stalls, Church of S. Pietro,  Perugia, Italy.]      XLI to XLVII.    PANELS FROM THE CHOIR STALLS, CHURCH OF S. PIETRO, PERUGIA, ITALY.    The principles governing the design of these panels so well explained in  the foregoing quotation can all be seen exemplified in the plates. They  are all built upon a central axis, and the proportion and distribution  of the various motives most carefully studied and beautifully carried  out. Although all are shorter than the usual pilaster, the design is  exactly similar to that usually employed for this purpose. Even the  horizontal panels in plates XLVI and XLVII follow precisely the same  rules of design.          [Illustration: XLVIII. Panel from the Chamber of Commerce, Perugia,  Italy.]      XLVIII.    PANEL FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, PERUGIA, ITALY.    This panel, although from a different building, is so similar in  treatment to the ones in the Church of S. Pietro that it can be classed  with them, and all that has been said of them applies as well to this.          Architectural Schools.      It is not many years since there was but one school in America to which  a young man could go with the expectation of getting instruction in  architecture, or at least where a special course of training was laid  out for this purpose. At present there are six well-equipped  architectural schools connected with as many colleges, each with its own  corps of instructors and each presenting special advantages to students.  In addition to these principal institutions there are a number of others  in which instruction in architecture is given, either independently or  in connection with other courses. To a young man intending to take up  the study of architecture this array of opportunities may not appear in  exactly the light of an embarrassment of riches, but it furnishes a wide  field from which to choose, and it may not be an easy matter to  determine which under the special circumstances connected with each case  presents the greatest advantages. For this reason a general statement of  the main features and practical equipment of the principal schools may  be of service in enabling intending students to choose intelligently  among them.      MASS. INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.    The oldest, the most thoroughly appointed, and largest architectural  school in the country is the Department of Architecture at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. It is in charge of  Professor Francis W. Chandler, with a corps of ten professors,  assistants, and special lecturers. The regular course consists of four  years' study. Special students are admitted after satisfying the faculty  by examination or otherwise that they are proficient in the preparatory  studies required and are qualified to pursue to advantage the special  work chosen.    The instruction in this department comprises the study of construction  and materials, the study of building processes, and of professional  practice, as well as that of composition and design, and of the history  of architecture. It is arranged to meet the wants both of those who  commence their professional studies at the beginning, and to some extent  of experienced draughtsmen who desire to make up deficiencies in their  training, or to qualify themselves for undertaking the responsibilities  of practice.    The more strictly professional work begins with the study of the five  orders and their applications, and of architectural history. During each  year there is regular instruction in freehand drawing, the last year  being from life. There is also a special class in pen-and-ink drawing  under Mr. D. A. Gregg. Instruction is given in watercolor drawing by Mr.  Ross Turner. The students are familiarized with the material elements of  their future work by a course in practical construction, illustrated by  lectures, problems, and by visits to buildings. The subject of  specifications and contracts is discussed. Problems in construction of  all kinds are given, to fix in the memory the principles already  learned.    For two and one-half years the students are continually engaged upon  architectural design under the charge of Professor Despradelle and Mr.  S. W. Mead. Each student's work is examined and criticized before the  classes by a jury from the Boston Society of Architects.    The Boston Society of Architects has established two prizes of the value  of fifty dollars each in books for students who at the end of the year  exhibit the best work.    Several thousand photographs, prints, drawings, and casts were  originally collected for the Department by means of a special fund  raised for the purpose. To these collections large additions have been  made, at first mostly by gifts, but later by regular appropriations.

Curtis_            FOREWORD      _In Mr. Curtis we have both an artist and a trained observer, whose  pictures are pictures, not merely photographs; whose work has far more  than mere accuracy, because it is truthful. All serious students are to be  congratulated because he is putting his work in permanent form; for our  generation offers the last chance for doing what Mr. Curtis has done. The  Indian as he has hitherto been is on the point of passing away. His life  has been lived under conditions thru which our own race past so many ages  ago that not a vestige of their memory remains. It would be a veritable  calamity if a vivid and truthful record of these conditions were not kept.  No one man alone could preserve such a record in complete form. Others  have worked in the past, and are working in the present, to preserve parts  of the record; but Mr. Curtis, because of the singular combination of  qualities with which he has been blest, and because of his extraordinary  success in making and using his opportunities, has been able to do what no  other man ever has done; what, as far as we can see, no other man could  do. He is an artist who works out of doors and not in the closet. He is a  close observer, whose qualities of mind and body fit him to make his  observations out in the field, surrounded by the wild life he  commemorates. He has lived on intimate terms with many different tribes of  the mountains and the plains. He knows them as they hunt, as they travel,  as they go about their various avocations on the march and in the camp. He  knows their medicine men and sorcerers, their chiefs and warriors, their  young men and maidens. He has not only seen their vigorous outward  existence, but has caught glimpses, such as few white men ever catch, into  that strange spiritual and mental life of theirs; from whose innermost  recesses all white men are forever barred. Mr. Curtis in publishing this  book is rendering a real and great service; a service not only to our own  people, but to the world of scholarship everywhere._    THEODORE ROOSEVELT    _October 1st, 1906._                        [Illustration: Theodore Roosevelt]                               [Illustration: White River - Apache]                               White River - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1903 by E.S. Curtis_            GENERAL INTRODUCTION      The task of recording the descriptive material embodied in these volumes,  and of preparing the photographs which accompany them, had its inception  in 1898. Since that time, during each year, months of arduous labor have  been spent in accumulating the data necessary to form a comprehensive and  permanent record of all the important tribes of the United States and  Alaska that still retain to a considerable degree their primitive customs  and traditions. The value of such a work, in great measure, will lie in  the breadth of its treatment, in its wealth of illustration, and in the  fact that it represents the result of personal study of a people who are  rapidly losing the traces of their aboriginal character and who are  destined ultimately to become assimilated with the \"superior race.\"    It has been the aim to picture all features of the Indian life and  environment--types of the young and the old, with their habitations,  industries, ceremonies, games, and everyday customs. Rather than being  designed for mere embellishment, the photographs are each an illustration  of an Indian character or of some vital phase in his existence. Yet the  fact that the Indian and his surroundings lend themselves to artistic  treatment has not been lost sight of, for in his country one may treat  limitless subjects of an aesthetic character without in any way doing  injustice to scientific accuracy or neglecting the homelier phases of  aboriginal life. Indeed, in a work of this sort, to overlook those  marvellous touches that Nature has given to the Indian country, and for  the origin of which the native ever has a wonder-tale to relate, would be  to neglect a most important chapter in the story of an environment that  made the Indian much of what he is. Therefore, being directly from Nature,  the accompanying pictures show what actually exists or has recently  existed (for many of the subjects have already passed forever), not what  the artist in his studio may presume the Indian and his surroundings to  be.    The task has not been an easy one, for although lightened at times by the  readiness of the Indians to impart their knowledge, it more often required  days and weeks of patient endeavor before my assistants and I succeeded in  overcoming the deep-rooted superstition, conservatism, and secretiveness  so characteristic of primitive people, who are ever loath to afford a  glimpse of their inner life to those who are not of their own. Once the  confidence of the Indians gained, the way led gradually through the  difficulties, but long and serious study was necessary before knowledge of  the esoteric rites and ceremonies could be gleaned.
