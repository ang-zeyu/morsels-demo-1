ANOTHER STORY BEGINS                    296          THE QUIRT          CHAPTER ONE    LITTLE FISH      Quirt Creek flowed sluggishly between willows which sagged none too  gracefully across its deeper pools, or languished beside the rocky  stretches that were bone dry from July to October, with a narrow channel  in the center where what water there was hurried along to the pools  below. For a mile or more, where the land lay fairly level in a  platter-like valley set in the lower hills, the mud that rimmed the  pools was scored deep with the tracks of the \"TJ up-and-down\" cattle, as  the double monogram of Hunter and Johnson was called.    A hard brand to work, a cattleman would tell you. Yet the TJ up-and-down  herd never seemed to increase beyond a niggardly three hundred or so,  though the Quirt ranch was older than its lordly neighbors, the Sawtooth  Cattle Company, who numbered their cattle by tens of thousands and  whose riders must have strings of fifteen horses apiece to keep them  going; older too than many a modest ranch that had flourished awhile and  had finished as line-camps of the Sawtooth when the Sawtooth bought  ranch and brand for a lump sum that looked big to the rancher, who  immediately departed to make himself a new home elsewhere: older than  others which had somehow gone to pieces when the rancher died or went to  the penitentiary under the stigma of a long sentence as a cattle thief.  There were many such, for the Sawtooth, powerful and stern against  outlawry, tolerated no pilfering from their thousands.    The less you have, the more careful you are of your possessions. Hunter  and Johnson owned exactly a section and a half of land, and for a mile  and a half Quirt Creek was fenced upon either side. They hired two men,  cut what hay they could from a field which they irrigated, fed their  cattle through the cold weather, watched them zealously through the  summer, and managed to ship enough beef each fall to pay their grocery  bill and their men's wages and have a balance sufficient to buy what  clothes they needed, and perhaps pay a doctor if one of them fell ill.  Which frequently happened, since Brit was becoming a prey to rheumatism  that sometimes kept him in bed, and Frank occasionally indulged himself  in a gallon or so of bad whisky and suffered afterwards from a badly  deranged digestion.    Their house was a two-room log cabin, built when logs were easier to get  than lumber. That the cabin contained two rooms was the result of  circumstances rather than design. Brit had hauled from the mountain-side  logs long and logs short, and it had seemed a shame to cut the long ones  any shorter. Later, when the outside world had crept a little closer to  their wilderness--as, go where you will, the outside world has a way of  doing--he had built a lean-to shed against the cabin from what lumber  there was left after building a cowshed against the log barn.    In the early days, Brit had had a wife and two children, but the wife  could not endure the loneliness of the ranch nor the inconvenience of  living in a two-room log cabin. She was continually worrying over  rattlesnakes and diphtheria and pneumonia, and begging Brit to sell out  and live in town. She had married him because he was a cowboy, and  because he was a nimble dancer and rode gallantly with silver-shanked  spurs ajingle on his heels and a snakeskin band around his hat, and  because a ranch away out on Quirt Creek had sounded exactly like a story  in a book.    Adventure, picturesqueness, even romance, are recognized and appreciated  only at a distance. Mrs. Hunter lost the perspective of romance and  adventure, and shed tears because there was sufficient mineral in the  water to yellow her week's washing, and for various other causes which  she had never foreseen and to which she refused to resign herself.    Came a time when she delivered a shrill-voiced, tear-blurred ultimatum  to Brit. Either he must sell out and move to town, or she would take the  children and leave him. Of towns Brit knew nothing except the  post-office, saloon, cheap restaurant side,--and a barber shop where a  fellow could get a shave and hair-cut before he went to see his girl.  Brit could not imagine himself actually _living_, day after day, in a  town. Three or four days had always been his limit. It was in a  restaurant that he had first met his wife. He had stayed three days when  he had meant to finish his business in one, because there was an  awfully nice girl waiting on table in the Palace, and because there was  going to be a dance on Saturday night, and he wanted his acquaintance  with her to develop to the point where he might ask her to go with him,  and be reasonably certain of a favorable answer.    Brit would not sell his ranch. In this Frank Johnson, old-time friend  and neighbor, who had taken all the land the government would allow one  man to hold, and whose lines joined Brit's, profanely upheld him. They  had planned to run cattle together, had their brand already recorded,  and had scraped together enough money to buy a dozen young cows.  Luckily, Brit had \"proven up\" on his homestead, so that when the irate  Mrs. Hunter deserted him she did not jeopardize his right to the land.    Brit was philosophical, thinking that a year or so of town life would be  a cure. If he missed the children, he was free from tears and nagging  complaints, so that his content balanced his loneliness. Frank proved up  and came down to live with him, and the partnership began to wear into  permanency. Share and share alike, they lived and worked and wrangled  together like brothers.    For months Brit's wife was too angry and spiteful to write. Then she  wrote acrimoniously, reminding Brit of his duty to his children. Royal  was old enough for school and needed clothes. She was slaving for them  as she had never thought to slave when Brit promised to honor and  protect her, but the fact remained that he was their father even if he  did not act like one. She needed at least ten dollars.    Brit showed the letter to Frank, and the two talked it over solemnly  while they sat on inverted feed buckets beside the stable, facing the  unearthly beauty of a cloud-piled Idaho sunset. They did not feel that  they could afford to sell a cow, and two-year-old steers were out of the  question. They decided to sell an unbroken colt that a cow-puncher  fancied. In a week Brit wrote a brief, matter-of-fact letter to Minnie  and enclosed a much-worn ten-dollar banknote. With the two dollars and a  half which remained of his share of the sale, Brit sent to a mail-order  house for a mackinaw coat, and felt cheated afterwards because the coat  was not \"wind and water proof\" as advertised in the catalogue.    More months passed, and Brit received, by registered mail, a notice that  he was being sued for divorce on the ground of non-support. He felt  hurt, because, as he pointed out to Frank, he was perfectly willing to  support Minnie and the kids if they came back where he could have a  chance. He wrote this painstakingly to the lawyer and received no reply.  Later he learned from Minnie that she had freed herself from him, and  that she was keeping boarders and asking no odds of him.    To come at once to the end of Brit's matrimonial affairs, he heard from  the children once in a year, perhaps, after they were old enough to  write. He did not send them money, because he seemed never to have any  money to send, and because they did not ask for any. Dumbly he sensed,  as their handwriting and their spelling improved, that his children were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19172"],[0,"An Australian in China (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net                   *       *       *       *       *      +------------------------------------------------------------+      | Transcriber's Note:                                        |      |                                                            |      | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in        |      | this text.

CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTORY--MAINLY ABOUT MISSIONARIES AND THE CITY OF HANKOW.      In the first week of February, 1894, I returned to Shanghai from Japan.  It was my intention to go up the Yangtse River as far as Chungking, and  then, dressed as a Chinese, to cross quietly over Western China, the  Chinese Shan States, and Kachin Hills to the frontier of Burma. The  ensuing narrative will tell how easily and pleasantly this journey,  which a few years ago would have been regarded as a formidable  undertaking, can now be done.    The journey was, of course, in no sense one of exploration; it consisted  simply of a voyage of 1500 miles up the Yangtse River, followed by a  quiet, though extended, excursion of another 1500 miles along the great  overland highway into Burma, taken by one who spoke no Chinese, who had  no interpreter or companion, who was unarmed, but who trusted implicitly  in the good faith of the Chinese. Anyone in the world can cross over to  Burma in the way I did, provided he be willing to exercise for a certain  number of weeks or months some endurance--for he will have to travel  many miles on foot over a mountainous country--and much forbearance.    I went to China possessed with the strong racial antipathy to the  Chinese common to my countrymen, but that feeling has long since given  way to one of lively sympathy and gratitude, and I shall always look  back with pleasure to this journey, during which I experienced, while  traversing provinces as wide as European kingdoms, uniform kindness and  hospitality, and the most charming courtesy. In my case, at least, the  Chinese did not forget their precept, \"deal gently with strangers from  afar.\"    I left Shanghai on Sunday, February 11th, by the Jardine Matheson's  steamer _Taiwo_. One kind friend, a merchant captain who had seen life  in every important seaport in the world, came down, though it was past  midnight, to bid me farewell. We shook hands on the wharf, and for the  last time. Already he had been promised the first vacancy in Jardine  Matheson's. Some time after my departure, when I was in Western China,  he was appointed one of the officers of the ill-fated _Kowshing_, and  when this unarmed transport before the declaration of war was destroyed  by a Japanese gunboat, he was among the slain--struck, I believe, by a  Japanese bullet while struggling for life in the water.    I travelled as a Chinese, dressed in warm Chinese winter clothing, with  a pigtail attached to the inside of my hat. I could not have been more  comfortable. I had a small cabin to myself. I had of course my own  bedding, and by paying a Mexican dollar a day to the Chinese steward,  \"foreign chow,\" was brought me from the saloon. The traveller who cares  to travel in this way, to put his pride in his pocket and a pigtail down  his back, need pay only one-fourth of what it would cost him to travel  as a European in European dress.    But I was, I found, unwittingly travelling under false pretences. When  the smart chief officer came for my fare he charged me, I thought, too  little. I expressed my surprise, and said that I thought the fare was  seven dollars. \"So it is,\" he replied \"but we only charge missionaries  five dollars, and I knew you were a missionary even before they told  me.\" How different was his acuteness from that of the Chinese compradore  who received me on the China Merchants' steamer _Hsin Chi_, in which I  once made a voyage from"]]]
