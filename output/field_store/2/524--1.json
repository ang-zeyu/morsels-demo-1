I know this is so.  I discovered it for a fact when I was not more than \"knee-high to a  grasshopper\" myself. I knew, for example, that a certain amount of dirt  on my face and hands in no way interfered with my enjoyment of my  supper. The fact that my finger nails were not all they should have been  had no bearing whatsoever upon the efficiency of those same fingers.  Washing not only took time from other important pursuits, but also was  mildly unpleasant. Nevertheless, my mother was not even open to  reasonable argument on the matter. Arbitrarily, with the despotism of an  early Roman Emperor, she rendered a dictum to the effect that I must  wash, and soapy and submissive I had to be before I could come to the  table. Again, any reasonable child can tell you that pleasure is the  main object of eating; therefore, in all logic, one should eat if one  feels like it at ten o'clock in the morning, or at three o'clock in the  afternoon, a jar of Guava jelly, a pound of chocolates, a paper of  ginger cookies, or whatever may appeal to one's aesthetic taste. This  method of procedure, naturally, might necessitate recourse to the  brown-wood family medicine closet. Certain discomfort might ensue. But  was not the pleasure worth it? Again my mother arbitrarily took the  matter into her own hands, disagreeing with me on fundamentals. She  maintained that eating was not for pleasure simply, but for nourishment.  Sundry unfortunate remarks were made containing references to gluttony.  The pantry was locked, and regular meals at regular periods were  prescribed. Indeed, poems with dreadful morals for those who ate between  meals were recited to me, endeavor being made thereby to substitute  terror for inclination.    Any reasonable child will find many such parallel instances of the  assumed omnipotence of \"grownups.\" With this awful indictment before me,  you ask me, a \"grown-up,\" to write an introduction for the \"Firelight  Fairy Book,\" and thereby to assume the responsibility for passing  judgment upon it. There is but one circumstance that makes me willing to  do so. I believe that where any nice \"grown-up\" is concerned, if you  crack the hard outside shell with which circumstances have surrounded  him, beneath it you will find a child. Banking on this, I venture to say  that I thoroughly enjoyed the \"Firelight Fairy Book.\" I liked  particularly the story of the poor little prince, whose sneezing had  such a disastrous effect; and the lost half hour is unquestionably an  accurate historical account, because no one could have described so  accurately, simply from imagination, what a lost temper looked like.  What makes me even more willing to advance my opinion is that I do not  stand alone. My conclusions are supported by a jury of my peers, for I  have given the book as a Christmas gift, not only to my own children,  but to other people's children, and to one of the prominent Senators of  the United States. They have universally acclaimed it, and who can  question the judgment of such a jury?    Good luck to the \"Firelight Fairy Book.\" May it, like Scrooge's laugh in  the \"Christmas Carol,\" \"be the father of a long, long line of brilliant\"  books of a like nature for the enjoyment of all true children, whether  they be still at day school, or sitting in the high places of the world.    Believe me,  Yours very truly,  THEODORE ROOSEVELT    HENRY BESTON, ESQ.  Topsfield, Mass.        HOW THE NEW FAIRY TALES CAME TO BE WRITTEN    Some twenty years ago, in a pleasant old town by the sea, lived a lad  who was very, very fond of fairy tales. When he had read all the  fairy-books which his parents and his uncles and his cousins and his  sisters and his aunts had been kind enough to give him, he turned to the  town library and read every single fairy tale he could find mentioned in  the catalogue. But there was an end even to this treasure; and, finally,  a day came when the fairy-tale lover could find no new tales to read.  Every Christmas he would peek at the new books in the bookshops, only to  find the same old stories printed, with new pictures, meant to please  grown-ups. What could be the matter? Had the fairies all gone away, or  locked the doors of Fairyland? Where, where, where were the new stories,  and why, why, why did n't people write them?    Some years passed. One pleasant summer day, as the fairy-tale lover sat  reading a book beneath the low spreading branches of an oak tree, he  heard a hum of wings, and looking up startled from his book, he  discovered the Fairy Goldenwand standing close by.    \"Are you still seeking new fairy tales?\" said the Fairy Goldenwand.    \"Yes,\" said the reader.    \"Will you write them down if I tell you some really new ones?\" said the  Fairy.    \"Oh yes, indeed,\" said the reader. \"And I'll put them into a book; and  next Saturday Mr. Day, the artist, will come down; we shall have tea  here under the oak tree,--do you like hot buttered toast?--and you must  tell him all about the fashions in Fairyland.\"    \"Oh, that will be fine!\" said the Fairy Goldenwand. \"I knew you would  n't mind my appearing so suddenly. Ever so many things have happened in  Fairyland since the last books were written, and we all think it's a  dreadful shame that children have n't heard about them. Just imagine  boys and girls not knowing about the adventures of the Prince in Lantern  Land! Shall I tell you the story?\"    And that's the way the author heard about the Shepherd of Clouds,  Florian, Marianna, Giles, Bobo, and all the other new friends. That you  may long enjoy their adventures is the wish of    HENRY BESTON  MAURICE E.

He got his father's permission to  depart, kissed his parents good-bye, mounted his black horse, and  galloped away down the high road. Soon the gray towers of the old castle  in which he was born hid themselves behind him.    The Prince journeyed on, spending the days in traveling, and the nights  in little wayside inns, till one day he found himself in the heart of  the Adamant Mountains. The great, red granite crags of the surrounding  peaks rose out of the gleaming snow like ugly fingers, and the slopes of  giant glaciers sparkled in the sun like torrents of diamonds. The Prince  sat down by some stunted trees whose tops had long before been broken  off by an avalanche, and began to eat the bit of bread and cheese which  he had stored in his pocket. His black horse, meanwhile, ate the grass  which grew here and there along the mountain path. And as the Prince sat  there in the bright sun and the silence of the mountains, he became  aware of a low, continuous roaring.    \"There must be a waterfall near-by,\" said the Prince to himself. \"I'll  go and see it.\"    So, casting another look at his steed, who was contentedly browsing, the  Prince climbed up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net  (This file was made using scans of public domain works  from the University of Michigan Digital Libraries.)

PREFACE.      This volume is one result of a scientific expedition to the equatorial  Andes and the river Amazon. The expedition was made under the auspices  of the Smithsonian Institution, and consisted of the following gentlemen  besides the writer: Colonel Staunton, of Ingham University, Leroy, N.Y.;  F.S. Williams, Esq., of Albany, N.Y.; and Messrs. P.V. Myers and A.  Bushnell, of Williams College. We sailed from New York July 1, 1867;  and, after crossing the Isthmus of Panama and touching at Paita, Peru,  our general route was from Guayaquil to Quito, over the Eastern  Cordillera; thence over the Western Cordillera, and through the forest  on foot to Napo; down the Rio Napo by canoe to Pebas, on the Maranon;  and thence by steamer to Para.[1]    [Footnote 1: Another division, consisting of Messrs. H.M. Myers, R.H.  Forbes, and W. Gilbert, of Williams College, proceeded to Venezuela, and  after exploring the vicinity of Lake Valencia, the two former traversed  the Ilanos to Pao, descended the Apure and ascended the Orinoco to  Yavita, crossed the portage of Pimichin (a low, level tract, nine miles  wide, separating the waters of the Orinoco from those of the Amazon),  and descended the Negro to Manaos, making a voyage by canoe of over 2000  miles through a little-known but deeply-interesting region. A narrative  of this expedition will soon be given to the public.]    Nearly the entire region traversed by the expedition is strangely  misrepresented by the most recent geographical works. On the Andes of  Ecuador we have little besides the travels of Humboldt; on the Napo,  nothing; while the Maranon is less known to North Americans than the  Nile.    Many of the following pages first appeared in the New York _Evening  Post_. The author has also published \"Physical Observations on the Andes  and the Amazon\" and \"Geological Notes on the Ecuadorian Andes\" in the  _American Journal of Science_, an article on the great earthquake of  1868 in the Rochester _Democrat_, and a paper _On the Valley of the  Amazon_ read before the American Association at Salem. These papers have  been revised and extended, though the popular form has been retained. It  has been the effort of the writer to present a condensed but faithful  picture of the physical aspect, the resources, and the inhabitants of  this vast country, which is destined to become an important field for  commercial enterprise. For detailed descriptions of the collections in  natural history, the scientific reader is referred to the various  reports of the following gentlemen, to whom the specimens were committed  by the Smithsonian Institution:    Volcanic Rocks                  Dr. T.

Lawrence, of New York, has identified the  remainder, including all the hummers.]    Many of the type specimens are deposited in the museums of the  Smithsonian Institution, the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science,  the Boston Society of Natural History, the Peabody Academy of Science,  and Vassar College; but the bulk of the collection was purchased by  Ingham University, Leroy, New York.    The Map of Equatorial America was drawn with great care after original  observations and the surveys of Humboldt and Wisse on the Andes, and of  Azevedo, Castlenau, and Bates on the Amazon.[3] The names of Indian  tribes are in small capitals. Most of the illustrations are after  photographs or drawings made on the ground, and can be relied upon. The  portrait of Humboldt, which is for the first time presented to the  public, was photographed from the original painting in the possession of  Sr. Aguirre, Quito. Unlike the usual portrait--an old man, in  Berlin--this presents him as a young man in Prussian uniform, traveling  on the Andes.    [Footnote 3: We have retained the common orthography of this word,  though _Amazons_, used by Bates, is doubtless more correct, as more akin  to the Brazilian name _Amazonas_.]    We desire to express our grateful acknowledgments to the Smithsonian  Institution, Hon. William H. Seward, and Hon. James A. Garfield, of  Washington; to Cyrus W. Field, Esq., and William Pitt Palmer, Esq., of  New York; to C.P. Williams, Esq., of Albany; to Rev. J.C. Fletcher, now  United States Consul at Oporto; to Chaplain Jones, of Philadelphia; to  Dr. William Jameson, of the University of Quito; to J.F.

NOTE.--Osculati has alone preceded us, so far as we can learn, in  obtaining a vocabulary of Zaparo words; but, as his work is not to be  found in this country, we have not had the pleasure of making a  comparison.          INTRODUCTION    BY    REV. J.C. FLETCHER,    AUTHOR OF \"BRAZIL AND BRAZILIANS.\"      In this day of many voyages, in the Old World and the New, it is  refreshing to find an untrodden path. Central Africa has been more fully  explored than that region of Equatorial America which lies in the midst  of the Western Andes and upon the slopes of these mountain monarchs  which look toward the Atlantic. In this century one can almost count  upon his hand the travelers who have written of their journeys in this  unknown region. Our own Herndon and Gibbon descended--the one the  Peruvian and the other the Bolivian waters--the affluents of the Amazon,  beginning their voyage where the streams were mere channels for canoes,  and finishing it where the great river appears a fresh-water ocean. Mr.  Church, the artist, made the sketches for his famous \"Heart of the  Andes\" where the headwaters of the Amazon are rivulets. But no one whose  language is the English has journeyed down and described the voyage from  the _plateaux_ of Ecuador to the Atlantic Ocean until Professor Orton  and his party accomplished this feat in 1868. Yet it was over this very  route that the King of Waters (as the Amazon is called by the  aborigines) was originally discovered.
