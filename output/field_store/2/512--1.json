CONCLUSION        INTRODUCTION      The first printed suggestion that America should be called America  came from a German. Martin Waldseemueller, of Freiburg, in his  Cosmographiae Introductio, published in 1507, wrote: \"I do not see why  any one may justly forbid it to be named after Americus, its  discoverer, a man of sagacious mind, Amerige, that is the land of  Americus or America, since both Europe and Asia derived their names  from women.\"    The first complete ship-load of Germans left Gravesend July the 24th,  1683, and arrived in Philadelphia October the 6th, 1683. They settled  in Germantown, or, as it was then called, on account of the poverty of  the settlers, Armentown.    Up to within the last few years the majority of our settlers have been  Teutonic in blood and Protestant in religion. The English, Dutch,  Swedes, Germans, Scotch-Irish, who settled in America, were all, less  than two thousand years ago, one Germanic race from the country  surrounding the North Sea.    Since 1820 more than 5,200,000 Germans have settled in America. This  immigration of Germans has practically ceased, and it is a serious  loss to America, for it has been replaced by a much less desirable  type of settler. In 1882 western Europe sent us 563,174 settlers, or  87 per cent., while southern and eastern Europe and Asiatic Turkey  sent 83,637, or 13 per cent. In 1905 western Europe sent 215,863, or  21.7 per cent., and southern and eastern Europe and Asiatic Turkey,  808,856, or 78.9 per cent. of our new population. In 1910 there were  8,282,618 white persons of German origin in the United States;  2,501,181 were born in Germany; 3,911,847 were born in the United  States, both of whose parents were born in Germany; 1,869,590 were  born in the United States, one parent born in the United States and  one in Germany.    Not only have we been enriched by this mass of sober and industrious  people in the past, but Peter Muehlenberg, Christopher Ludwig, Steuben,  John Kalb, George Herkimer, and later Francis Lieber, Carl Schurz,  Sigel, Osterhaus, Abraham Jacobi, Herman Ridder, Oswald Ottendorfer,  Adolphus Busch, Isidor, Nathan, and Oscar Straus, Jacob Schiff, Otto  Kahn, Frederick Weyerheuser, Charles P. Steinmetz, Claus Spreckels,  Hugo Muensterberg, and a catalogue of others, have been leaders in  finance, in industry, in war, in politics, in educational and  philanthropic enterprises, and in patriotism.    The framework of our republican institutions, as I have tried to  outline in this volume, came from the \"Woods of Germany.\" Professor H.  A. L. Fisher, of Oxford, writes: \"European republicanism, which ever  since the French Revolution has been in the main a phenomenon of the  Latin races, was a creature of Teutonic civilization in the age of the  sea-beggars and the Roundheads. The half-Latin city of Geneva was the  source of that stream of democratic opinion in church and state,  which, flowing to England under Queen Elizabeth, was repelled by  persecution to Holland, and thence directed to the continent of North  America.\"    In these later days Goethe, in a letter to Eckermann, prophesied the  building of the Panama Canal by the Americans, and also the prodigious  growth of the United States toward the West.    In a private collection in New York, is an autograph letter of George  Washington to Frederick the Great, asking that Frederick should use  his influence to protect that French friend of America, Lafayette.    In Schiller's house in Weimar there still hangs an engraving of the  battle of Bunker Hill, by Mueller, a German, and a friend of the poet.    Bismarck's intimate friend as a student at Goettingen, and the man of  whom he spoke with warm affection all his life, was the American  historian Motley.    The German soldiers in our Civil War were numbered by the thousands.  We have many ties with Germany, quite enough, indeed, to make a bare  enumeration of them a sufficient introduction to this volume.    On more than one occasion of late I have been introduced in places,  and to persons where a slight picture of what I was to meet when the  doors were thrown open was of great help to me. I was told beforehand  something of the history, traditions, the forms and ceremonies, and  even something of the weaknesses and peculiarities of the society, the  persons, and the personages. I am not so wise a guide as some of my  sponsors have been, but it is something of the kind that I have wished  and planned to do for my countrymen. I have tried to make this book,  not a guidebook, certainly not a history; rather, in the words of  Bacon, \"grains of salt, which will rather give an appetite than offend  with satiety,\" a sketch, in short, of what is on the other side of the  great doors when the announcer speaks your name and you enter Germany.        GERMANY AND THE GERMANS    FROM AN AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW        GERMANY AND THE GERMANS FROM AN AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW    I THE CRADLE OF MODERN GERMANY      Eighty-one years before the discovery of America, seventy-two years  before Luther was born, and forty-one years before the discovery of  printing, in the year 1411, the Emperor Sigismund, the betrayer of  Huss, transferred the Mark of Brandenburg to his faithful vassal and  cousin, Frederick, sixth Burgrave of Nuremberg. Nuremberg was at one  time one of the great trading towns between Germany, Venice, and the  East, and the home later of Hans Sachs. Frederick was the lineal  descendant of Conrad of Hohenzollern, the first Burgrave of Nuremberg,  who lived in the days of Frederick Barbarossa (1152-1189); and this  Conrad is the twenty-fifth lineal ancestor of Emperor William II of  Germany. It is interesting to remember in this connection that when we  count back our progenitors to the twenty-first generation they number  something over two millions. When we trace an ancestry so far,  therefore, we must know something of the multitude from which the  individual is descended, if we are to gather anything of value  concerning his racial characteristics. The solace of all genealogical  investigation is the infallible discovery, that the greatest among us  began in a small way.    If you paddle up the Elbe and the Havel from Hamburg to Potsdam, you  will find yourself in the territory conquered from the heathen Wends  in the days of Henry I, the Fowler (918-935), which was the cradle of  what is now the German Empire.    The Emperor Sigismund, who was often embarrassed financially by reason  of his wars and journeyings had borrowed some four hundred thousand  gold florins from Frederick, and it was in settlement of this debt  that he mortgaged the territory of Brandenburg, and on the 8th of  April, 1417, the ceremony of enfeoffment was performed at Constance,  by which the House of Hohenzollern became possessed of this territory,  and was thereafter included among the great electorates having a vote  in the election of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.    It was Henricus Auceps, or Henry the Fowler, (so called because the  envoys sent to offer him the crown, found him on his estates in the  Hartz Mountains among his falcons), who fought off the Danes in the  northwest, and the Slavonians, or Wends, in the northeast, and the  Hungarians in the southeast, and established frontier posts or marks  for permanent protection against their ravages. These marks, or  marches, which were boundary lines, were governed by markgrafs or  marquises, and finally gave the name of marks to the territory itself.  The word is historically familiar from its still later use in noting  the old boundaries between England and Scotland, and England and  Wales, which are still called marks.    Henry the Fowler was also called Henry \"the City Builder.\" After the  death of the last of the Charlemagne line of rulers, the Franks  elected Conrad, Duke of Franconia, to succeed to the throne, and he on  his death-bed advised his people to choose Henry of Saxony to succeed,  for the times were stormy and the country needed a strong ruler. The  Hungarians in the southeast, and the Wends, the old Slavonic  population of Poland, were pillaging and harrying more and more  successfully, and the more successfully the more impudently. Henry  began the building of strong-walled, deep-moated cities along his  frontier, and made one, drawn by lot, out of every ten families of the  countryside, go to live in these fortified towns. Their rulers were  burgraves, or city counts. Titles now so largely ornamental were then  descriptive of duties and responsibilities.    In the light of their future greatness, it is well to take note of  these two frontier counties, or marches. The first, called the  Northern March, or March of Brandenburg, was the religious centre of  the Slays, and was situated in the midst of forests and marshes just  beyond the Elbe. This March of Brandenburg was won from the Slays in  the first instance by the Saxons and Franks of the Saxon plain. When  the burgrave, Frederick of Hohenzollern, came to take possession of  his new territory he was received with the jesting remark: \"Were it to  rain burgraves for a whole year, we should not allow them to grow in  the march.\" But Frederick's soldiers and money, and his Nuremberg  jewels, as his cannon were called,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net              Transcriber's Note    A number of typographical errors and inconsistencies have been  maintained in this version of this book.

NOTE      It has been thought desirable, for the advancement of the study of Maya  hieroglyphs, that the interpretation of the conventionalized animal  figures, which so frequently occur in the Maya codices, should be  undertaken. The Peabody Museum Committee on Central American Research  therefore requested Dr. A. M. Tozzer to prepare a paper on the subject,  and to secure the valuable cooperation of Dr. Glover M. Allen, a  zoologist familiar with the animals of Mexico and Central America, to  aid in the identification of the various species of animals which under  varying forms are used in connection with the glyphs.    While it is possible that some of the determinations given in this paper  may require further confirmation, it is evident that the combined  studies of Dr. Tozzer and Dr. Allen cannot fail to be useful to students  of the Maya hieroglyphic writing.

The various peoples inhabiting Mexico and Central America in early  pre-Columbian times were accustomed to record various events, especially  in regard to their calendar and the religious ceremonials in relation to  it, on long strips of skin or bark. These were usually painted on both  sides and folded together like a screen. Several of these codices are  still in existence from the Nahua and Zapotec areas in Mexico, but only  three have come down to us from the Maya region which is included in the  peninsula of Yucatan, the states of Tabasco and Chiapas in Mexico, and  portions of Guatemala and Honduras. These three manuscripts are the  Dresden Codex in the Royal Public Library at Dresden, the  Tro-Cortesianus (formerly considered to have been two, the Troano and  the Cortesianus) in the National Archaeological Museum at Madrid, and  the Peresianus in the National Library at Paris. These pre-Columbian  manuscripts have all been published in facsimile. (See bibliography.)    These remains of a once extensive literature show evidence not only of  considerable intellectual attainments on the part of their authors but  also of a high degree of artistic skill in the drawings and  hieroglyphics. The frequent occurrence in these manuscripts of  representations of animals showing various degrees of elaboration and  conventionalization has led us to undertake the task of identifying  these figures as far as possible and studying the uses and significance  of the several species, a field practically untouched.[284-*]  Foerstemann in his various commentaries on the Maya codices (1902, 1903,  1906), Brinton (1895), and deRosny[TN-3] (1876) have only commented briefly  upon this side of the study of the manuscripts. Seler (1904a) and some  others have written short papers on special animals. During the  preparation of this paper there has appeared a brief account by Stempell  (1908) of the animals in the Maya codices. The author has, however,  omitted a number of species and, as we believe, misidentified others. In  making our identifications we have given the reasons for our  determinations in some detail and have stated the characteristics  employed to denote the several species.    We have not limited ourselves entirely to the Maya manuscripts as we  have drawn upon the vast amount of material available in the stone  carvings, the stucco figures, and the frescoes found throughout the Maya  area. This material has by no means been exhausted in the present paper.  In addition to the figures from the Maya codices and a comparatively few  from other sources in the Maya region, we have introduced for comparison  in a number of cases figures from a few of the ancient manuscripts of  the Nahuas and the Zapotecs to the north. The calendar of these two  peoples is fundamentally the same as that of the Mayas. The year is made  up in the same way being composed of eighteen months of twenty days each  with five days additional at the end of the year. There is therefore a  more or less close connection as regards subject matter in all the  pre-Columbian codices of Mexico and Central America but the manner of  presentation differs among the different peoples of this region.      FOOTNOTES:    [284-*] The first two parts of Dr. Seler's Treatise, \"Die Tierbilder der  mexikanischen und der Maya-Handschriften\" published in the _Zeitschrift  fuer Ethnologie_, Vol. 41, have appeared during the time when this paper  was passing through the press. The most excellent and exhaustive  treatment by Dr. Seler would seem to render the present paper  unnecessary. It has seemed best, however, to continue with its  publication inasmuch as its field is narrower and more space is devoted  to the Maya side of the question to the exclusion of the Mexican. Dr.  Seler, on the other hand, while by no means neglecting the Maya, has  spent more time in explaining the Mexican figures.          I    SYNOPTIC CONSIDERATION OF THE MEANING AND OCCURRENCE OF ANIMAL FORMS      Before taking up the different animals in the codices it may be well to  consider some of the more common ways in which the figures occur and  their connection with the surrounding figures.
