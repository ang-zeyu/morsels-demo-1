It is  merely the record of a most delightful hunting trip into those  fascinating regions along the Equator, where one may still have  \"thrilling adventures\" and live in a story-book atmosphere, where the  \"roar of the lion\" and the \"crack of the rifle\" are part of the  every-day life, and where in a few months one may store up enough  material to keep the memory pleasantly occupied all the rest of a  lifetime. The stories are descriptive of a four-and-a-half months' trip  in the big game country and pretend to no more serious purpose than  merely to relate the experiences of a self-confessed amateur under such  conditions.

EXPERIENCES WITH WILLING FRIENDS AND  ADVISERS      Ever since I can remember, almost, I have cherished a modest ambition to  hunt lions and elephants. At an early age, or, to be more exact, at  about that age which finds most boys wondering whether they would rather  be Indian fighters or sailors, I ran across a copy of Stanley's _Through  the Dark Continent_. It was full of fascinating adventures. I thrilled  at the accounts which spoke in terms of easy familiarity of \"express\"  rifles and \"elephant\" guns, and in my vivid but misguided imagination, I  pictured an elephant gun as a sort of cannon--a huge, unwieldy  arquebus--that fired a ponderous shell. The old woodcuts of daring  hunters and charging lions inspired me with unrest and longing--the  longing to bid the farm farewell and start down the road for Africa.  Africa! What a picture it conjured up in my fancy! Then, as even now, it  symbolized a world of adventurous possibilities; and in my boyhood  fancy, it lay away off there--somewhere--vaguely--beyond mountains and  deserts and oceans, a vast, mysterious, unknown land, that swarmed with  inviting dangers and alluring romance.    One by one my other youthful ambitions have been laid away. I have given  up hope of ever being an Indian fighter out on the plains, because the  pesky redskins have long since ceased to need my strong right arm to  quell them. I also have yielded up my ambition to be a sailor, or  rather, that branch of the profession in which I hoped to  specialize--piracy--because, for some regretful reason, piracy has lost  much of its charm in these days of great liners. There is no treasure to  search for any more, and the golden age of the splendid clipper ships,  with their immense spread of canvas, has given way to the unromantic age  of the grimy steamer, about which there is so little to appeal to the  imagination. Consequently, lion hunting is about the only thing  left--except wars, and they are few and far between.    And so, after suffering this \"lion-hunting\" ambition to lie fallow for  many years, I at last reached a day when it seemed possible to realize  it. The chance came in a curiously unexpected way. Mr. Akeley, a man  famed in African hunting exploits, was to deliver a talk before a little  club to which I belonged. I went, and as a result of my thrilled  interest in every word he said, I met him and talked with him and  finally was asked to join a new African expedition that he had in  prospect. With the party were to be Mrs. Akeley, with a record of  fourteen months in the big game country, and Mr. Stephenson, a hunter  with many years of experience in the wild places of the United States,  Canada and Mexico. My hunting experience had been chiefly gained in my  library, but for some strange reason, it did not seem incongruous that I  should begin my real hunting in a lion and elephant country.    [Drawing: _Getting Ready for Lion Shooting_]    I had all the prowess of a Tartarin, and during the five months that  elapsed before I actually set forth, I went about my daily work with a  mind half dazed with the delicious consciousness that I was soon to  become a lion hunter. I feared that modern methods might have taken away  much of the old-time romance of the sport, but I felt certain that there  was still to be something left in the way of excitement and adventure.    The succeeding pages of this book contain the chronicle of the nine  delightful months that followed my departure "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#1)"],[1,"by Al Haines.

MY LAST MEETING WITH HASSAN OF ALEPPO          THE QUEST OF THE SACRED SLIPPER          CHAPTER I    THE PHANTOM SCIMITAR      I was not the only passenger aboard the S.S. Mandalay who perceived  the disturbance and wondered what it might portend and from whence  proceed.  A goodly number of passengers were joining the ship at  Port Said.  I was lounging against the rail, pipe in mouth, lazily  wondering, with a large vagueness.    What a heterogeneous rabble it was!--a brightly coloured rabble,  but the colours all were dirty, like the town and the canal. Only  the sky was clean; the sky and the hard, merciless sunlight which  spared nothing of the uncleanness, and defied one even to think  of the term dear to tourists, \"picturesque.\"  I was in that kind  of mood.  All the natives appeared to be pockmarked; all the  Europeans greasy with perspiration.    But what was the stir about?    I turned to the dark, bespectacled young man who leaned upon the  rail beside me.  From the first I had taken to Mr. Ahmad Ahmadeen.    \"There is some kind of undercurrent of excitement among the natives,\"  I said, \"a sort of subdued Greek chorus is audible.  What's it all  about?\"    Mr. Ahmadeen smiled.  After a gaunt fashion, he was a handsome man  and had a pleasant smile.    \"Probably,\" he replied, \"some local celebrity is joining the ship.\"    I stared at him curiously.    \"Any idea who he is?\"  (The soul of the copyhunter is a restless  soul.)    A group of men dressed in semi-European fashion--that is, in  European fashion save for their turbans, which were green--passed  close to us along the deck.    Ahmadeen appeared not to have heard the question.    The disturbance, which could only be defined as a subdued uproar,  but could be traced to no particular individual or group, grew  momentarily louder--and died away.  It was only when it had  completely ceased that one realized how pronounced it had  been--how altogether peculiar, secret; like that incomprehensible  murmuring in a bazaar when, unknown to the insular visitor, a  reputed saint is present.    Then it happened; the inexplicable incident which, though I knew  it not, heralded the coming of strange things, and the dawn of a  new power; which should set up its secret standards in England,  which should flood Europe and the civilized world with wonder.    A shrill scream marked the overture--a scream of fear and of pain,  which dropped to a groan, and moaned out into the silence of which  it was the cause.    \"My God! what's that?\"    I started forward.  There was a general crowding rush, and a darkly  tanned and bearded man came on board, carrying a brown leather case.  Behind him surged those who bore the victim.    \"It's one of the lascars!\"    \"No--an Egyptian!\"    \"It was a porter--?\"    \"What is it--?\"    \"Someone been stabbed!\"    \"Where's the doctor?\"    \"Stand away there, if you please!\"    That was a ship's officer; and the voice of authority served to  quell the disturbance.  Through a lane walled with craning heads  they bore the insensible man.  Ahmadeen was at my elbow.    \"A Copt,\" he said softly.  \"Poor devil!\"  I turned to him.  There  was a queer expression on his lean, clean-shaven, bronze face.    \"Good God!\" I said.  \"His hand has been cut off!\"    That was the fact of the matter.  And no one knew who was  responsible for the atrocity.  And no one knew what had become of  the severed hand!  I wasted not a moment in linking up the story.  The pressman within me acted automatically.    \"The gentleman just come aboard, sir,\" said a steward, \"is Professor  Deeping.  The poor beggar who was assaulted was carrying some of the  Professor's baggage.\"  The whole incident struck me as most odd.  There was an idea lurking in my mind that something else--something  more--lay behind all this.  With impatience I awaited the time  when the injured man, having received medical attention, was conveyed  ashore, and Professor Deeping reappeared.  To the celebrated  traveller and Oriental scholar I introduced myself.    He was singularly reticent.    \"I was unable to see what took place, Mr. Cavanagh,\" he said.  \"The  poor fellow was behind me, for I had stepped from the boat ahead of  him.  I had just taken a bag from his hand, but he was carrying  another, heavier one.  It is a clean cut, like that of a scimitar.  I have seen very similar wounds in the cases of men who have  suffered the old Moslem penalty for theft.\"    Nothing further had come to light when the Mandalay left, but I  found new matter for curiosity in the behaviour of the Moslem party  who had come on board at Port Said.    In conversation with Mr. Bell, the chief officer, I learned that  the supposed leader of the party was one, Mr. Azraeel.  \"Obviously,\"  said Bell, \"not his real name or not all it.  I don't suppose  they'll show themselves on deck; they've got their own servants with  them, and seem to be people of consequence.\"    This conversation was interrupted, but I found my unseen fellow  voyagers peculiarly interesting and pursued inquiries in other  directions.  I saw members of the distinguished travellers'  retinue going about their duties, but never obtained a glimpse  of Mr. Azraeel nor of any of his green-turbaned companions.    \"Who is Mr. Azraeel?\" I asked Ahmadeen.    \"I cannot say,\" replied the Egyptian, and abruptly changed the  subject.    Some curious aroma of mystery floated about the ship.  Ahmadeen  conveyed to me the idea that he was concealing something.  Then,  one night, Mr. Bell invited me to step forward with him.    \"Listen,\" he said.    From somewhere in the fo'c'sle proceeded low chanting.    \"Hear it?\"    \"Yes.  What the devil is it?\"    \"It's the lascars,\" said Bell.  \"They have been behaving in a most  unusual manner ever since the mysterious Mr. Azraeel joined us.  I  may be wrong in associating the two things, but I shan't be sorry  to see the last of our mysterious passengers.\"    The next happening on board the Mandalay which I have to record was  the attempt to break open the door of Professor Deeping's stateroom.  Except when he was actually within, the Professor left his room door  religiously locked.    He made light of the affair, but later took me aside and told me a  curious story of an apparition which had appeared to him.    \"It was a crescent of light,\" he said, \"and it glittered through  the darkness there to the left as I lay in my berth.\"    \"A reflection from something on the deck?\"    Deeping smiled, uneasily.    \"Possibly,\" he replied; \"but it was very sharply defined.  Like  the blade of a scimitar,\" he added.    I stared at him, my curiosity keenly aroused.  \"Does any explanation  suggest itself to you?\" I said.    \"Well,\" he confessed, \"I have a theory, I will admit; but it is  rather going back to the Middle Ages.  You see, I have lived in the  East a lot; perhaps I have assimilated some of their superstitions.\"    He was oddly reticent, as ever.  I felt convinced that he was  keeping something back.  I could not stifle the impression that the  clue to these mysteries lay somewhere around the invisible  Mohammedan party.    \"Do you know,\" said Bell to me, one morning, \"this trip's giving me  the creeps.  I believe the damned ship's haunted!  Three bells in the  middle watch last night, I'll swear I saw some black animal crawling  along the deck, in the direction of the forward companion-way.\"    \"Cat?\" I suggested.    \"Nothing like it,\" said Mr. Bell.  \"Mr. Cavanagh, it was some  uncanny thing!  I'm afraid I can't explain quite what I mean, but  it was something I wanted to shoot!\"    \"Where did it go?\"    The chief officer shrugged his shoulders. \"Just vanished,\" he said.  \"I hope I don't see it again.\"    At Tilbury the Mohammedan party went ashore in a body.  Among them  were veiled women.  They contrived so to surround a central figure  that I entirely failed to get a glimpse of the mysterious Mr.  Azraeel.  Ahmadeen was standing close by the companion-way, and I  had a momentary impression that one of the women slipped something  into his hand.  Certainly, he started; and his dusky face seemed to  pale.    Then a deck steward came out of Deeping's stateroom, carrying the  brown bag which the Professor had brought aboard at Port Said.  Deeping's voice came:    \"Hi, my man!  Let me take that bag!\"    The bag changed hands.  Five minutes later, as I was preparing to  go ashore, arose a horrid scream above the berthing clamour.  Those  passengers yet aboard made in the direction from which the scream  had proceeded.    A steward--the one to whom Professor Deeping had spoken--lay  writhing at the foot of the stairs leading to the saloon-deck.  His  right hand had been severed above the wrist!
