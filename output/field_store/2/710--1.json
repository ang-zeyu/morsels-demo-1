CHARLIER    SCIENTIA PUBLISHER  LUND 1921      HAMBURG 1921  PRINTED BY _LUeTCKE & WULFF_          CHAPTER I.    APPARENT ATTRIBUTES OF THE STARS.      1. Our knowledge of the stars is based on their _apparent_ attributes,  obtained from the astronomical observations. The object of astronomy is  to deduce herefrom the real or _absolute_ attributes of the stars, which  are their position in space, their movement, and their physical nature.    The apparent attributes of the stars are studied by the aid of their  _radiation_. The characteristics of this radiation may be described in  different ways, according as the nature of the light is defined.  (Undulatory theory, Emission theory.)    From the statistical point of view it will be convenient to consider the  radiation as consisting of an emanation of small particles from the  radiating body (the star). These particles are characterized by certain  attributes, which may differ in degree from one particle to another.  These attributes may be, for instance, the diameter and form of the  particles, their mode of rotation, &c. By these attributes the optical  and electrical properties of the radiation are to be explained. I shall  not here attempt any such explanation, but shall confine myself to the  property which the particles have of possessing a different mode of  deviating from the rectilinear path as they pass from one medium to  another. This deviation depends in some way on one or more attributes of  the particles. Let us suppose that it depends on a single attribute,  which, with a terminology derived from the undulatory theory of  HUYGHENS, may be called the _wave-length_ ([lambda]) of the particle.    The statistical characteristics of the radiation are then in the first  place:--    (1) the total number of particles or the _intensity_ of the radiation;    (2) the _mean wave-length_ ([lambda]_0) of the radiation, also called  (or nearly identical with) the _effective_ wave-length or the colour;    (3) _the dispersion of the wave-length_. This characteristic of the  radiation may be determined from the _spectrum_, which also gives the  variation of the radiation with [lambda], and hence may also determine  the mean wave-length of the radiation.    Moreover we may find from the radiation of a star its apparent place on  the sky.    The intensity, the mean wave-length, and the dispersion of the  wave-length are in a simple manner connected with the _temperature_  (_T_) of the star. According to the radiation laws of STEPHAN and WIEN  we find, indeed (compare L. M. 41[1]) that the intensity is proportional  to the fourth power of _T_, whereas the mean wave-length and the  dispersion of the wave-length are both inversely proportional to _T_. It  follows that with increasing temperature the mean wave-length  diminishes--the colour changing into violet--and simultaneously the  dispersion of the wave-length and also even the total length of the  spectrum are reduced (decrease).      2. _The apparent position of a star_ is generally denoted by its right  ascension ([alpha]) and its declination ([delta]). Taking into account  the apparent distribution of the stars in space, it is, however, more  practical to characterize the position of a star by its galactic  longitude (_l_) and its galactic latitude (_b_). Before defining these  coordinates, which will be generally used in the following pages, it  should be pointed out that we shall also generally give the coordinates  [alpha] and [delta] of the stars in a particular manner. We shall  therefore use an abridged notation, so that if for instance [alpha] =  17h 44m.7 and [delta] = +35 deg..84, we shall write        ([alpha][delta]) = (174435).    If [delta] is negative, for instance [delta] = -35 deg..84, we write        ([alpha][delta]) = (1744{35}),    so that the last two figures are in italics.    [Transcriber's Note: In this version of the text, the last two figures  are enclosed in braces to represent the italics.]    This notation has been introduced by PICKERING for variable stars and is  used by him everywhere in the Annals of the Harvard Observatory, but it  is also well suited to all stars. This notation gives, simultaneously,  the characteristic _numero_ of the stars. It is true that two or more  stars may in this manner obtain the same characteristic _numero_. They  are, however, easily distinguishable from each other through other  attributes.    The _galactic_ coordinates _l_ and _b_ are referred to the Milky Way  (the Galaxy) as plane of reference. The pole of the Milky Way has  according to HOUZEAU and GOULD the position ([alpha][delta]) = (124527).  From the distribution of the stars of the spectral type B I have in L.  M. II, 14[2] found a somewhat different position. But having ascertained  later that the real position of the galactic plane requires a greater  number of stars for an accurate determination of its value, I have  preferred to employ the position used by PICKERING in the Harvard  catalogues, namely ([alpha][delta]) = (124028), or        [alpha] = 12h 40m = 190 deg., [delta] = +28 deg.,    which position is now exclusively used in the stellar statistical  investigations at the Observatory of Lund and is also used in these  lectures.    The galactic longitude (_l_) is reckoned from the ascending node of the  Milky Way on the equator, which is situated in the constellation  _Aquila_. The galactic latitude (_b_) gives the angular distance of the  star from the Galaxy. On plate I, at the end of these lectures, will be  found a fairly detailed diagram from which the conversion of [alpha] and  [delta] of a star into _l_ and _b_ may be easily performed. All stars  having an apparent magnitude brighter than 4m are directly drawn.    Instead of giving the galactic longitude and latitude of a star we may  content ourselves with giving the galactic _square_ in which the star is  situated. For this purpose we assume the sky to be divided into 48  squares, all having the same surface. Two of these squares lie at the  northern pole of the Galaxy and are designated GA_1 and GA_2. Twelve lie  north of the galactic plane, between 0 deg. and 30 deg. galactic latitude, and  are designated GC_1, GC_2, ..., GC_12. The corresponding squares south  of the galactic equator (the plane of the Galaxy) are called GD_1, GD_2,  ..., GD_12. The two polar squares at the south pole are called GF_1 and  GF_2. Finally we have 10 B-squares, between the A- and C-squares and 10  corresponding E-squares in the southern hemisphere.    The distribution of the squares in the heavens is here graphically  represented in the projection of FLAMSTEED, which has the advantage of  giving areas proportional to the corresponding spherical areas, an  arrangement necessary, or at least highly desirable, for all stellar  statistical researches. It has also the advantage of affording a  continuous representation of the whole sky.    The correspondence between squares and stellar constellations is seen  from plate II. Arranging the constellations according to their galactic  longitude we find north of the galactic equator (in the C-squares) the  constellations:--        Hercules, Cygnus, Cepheus, Cassiopaea, Auriga, Gemini, Canis Minor,      Pyxis, Vela, Centaurus, Scorpius, Ophiuchus,    and south of this equator (in the D-squares):--        Aquila, Cygnus, Lacerta, Andromeda, Perseus, Orion, Canis Major,      Puppis, Carina, Circinus, Corona australis, Sagittarius,    mentioning only one constellation for each square.    At the north galactic pole (in the two A-squares) we have:--        Canes Venatici and Coma Berenices,    and at the south galactic pole (in the two F-squares):--        Cetus and Sculptor.      3. _Changes in the position of a star._ From the positions of a star on  two or more occasions we obtain its apparent motion, also called the  _proper motion_ of the star. We may distinguish between a _secular_ part  of this motion and a _periodical_ part. In both cases the motion may be  either a reflex of the motion of the observer, and is then called  _parallactic_ motion, or it may be caused by a real motion of the star.  From the parallactic motion of the star it is possible to deduce its  distance from the sun, or its parallax. The periodic parallactic proper  motion is caused by the motion of the earth around the sun, and gives  the _annual parallax_ ([pi]). In order to obtain available annual  parallaxes of a star it is usually necessary for the star to be nearer  to us than 5 siriometers, corresponding to a parallax greater than  0\".04. More seldom we may in this manner obtain trustworthy values for a  distance amounting to 10 siriometers ([pi] = 0\".02), or even still  greater values. For such large distances the _secular_ parallax, which  is caused by the progressive motion of the sun in space, may give better  results, especially if the mean distance of a group of stars is  simultaneously determined. Such a value of the secular parallax is also  called, by KAPTEYN, the _systematic_ parallax of the stars.    When we speak of the proper motion of a star, without further  specification, we mean always"]]]
