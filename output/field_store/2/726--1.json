PREFACE      This unpretentious little book is the outcome of my own experiences and  adventures in Alaska. Two trips, covering a period of eighteen months  and a distance of over twelve thousand miles were made practically  alone.    In answer to the oft-repeated question of why I went to Alaska I can  only give the same reply that so many others give: I wanted to go in  search of my fortune which had been successfully eluding my grasp for a  good many years. Neither home nor children claimed my attention. No good  reason, I thought, stood in the way of my going to Alaska; for my  husband, traveling constantly at his work had long ago allowed me carte  blanche as to my inclinations and movements. To be sure, there was no  money in the bank upon which to draw, and an account with certain  friends whose kindness and generosity cannot be forgotten, was opened up  to pay passage money; but so far neither they nor I have regretted  making the venture.    I had first-class health and made up in endurance what I lacked in  avoirdupois, along with a firm determination to take up the first honest  work that presented itself, regardless of choice, and in the meantime to  secure a few gold claims, the fame of which had for two years reached my  ears.    In regard to the truthfulness of this record I have tried faithfully to  relate my experiences as they took place. Not all, of course, have been  included, for numerous and varied trials came to me, of which I have not  written, else a far more thrilling story could have been told.    Enough has, however, been noted to give my readers a fair idea of a  woman's life during a period of eighteen months in a few of the roughest  mining camps in the world; and that many may be interested, and to some  extent possibly instructed by the perusal of my little book, is the  sincere wish of the author.                                                       MAY KELLOGG SULLIVAN.          A WOMAN WHO WENT--TO ALASKA.          CHAPTER I.    UNDER WAY.      My first trip from California to Alaska was made in the summer of 1899.  I went alone to Dawson to my father and brother, surprising them greatly  when I quietly walked up to shake hands with them at their work. The  amazement of my father knew no bounds,--and yet I could see a lot of  quiet amusement beneath all when he introduced me to his friends, which  plainly said:    \"Here is my venturesome daughter, who is really a 'chip off the old  block,' so you must not be surprised at her coming to Alaska.\"    Father had gone to the Klondyke a year before at the age of sixty-four,  climbing Chilkoot Pass in the primitive way and \"running\" Miles Canyon  and White Horse Rapids in a small boat which came near being swamped in  the passage.    My brother's entrance to the famous gold fields was made in the same  dangerous manner a year before; but I had waited until trains over the  White Pass and Yukon Railroad had been crossing the mountains daily for  two weeks before myself attempting to get into Alaska's interior. At  that time it was only a three hours' ride, including stops, over the  Pass to Lake Bennett, the terminus of this new railroad, the first in  Alaska. A couple of rude open flat cars with springless seats along the  sides were all the accommodation we had as passengers from the summit of  White Pass to Lake Bennett; we having paid handsomely for the privilege  of riding in this manner and thinking ourselves fortunate, considering  the fact that our route was, during the entire distance of about  forty-five miles, strewn with the bleaching bones of earlier argonauts  and their beasts of burden.    Naturally, my traveling companions interested me exceedingly. There were  few women. Two ladies with their husbands were going to Dawson on  business. About eight or ten other women belonging to the rapid class of  individuals journeyed at the same time. We had all nationalities and  classes. There were two women from Europe with luggage covered with  foreign stickers, and a spoken jargon which was neither German nor  French, but sounded like a clever admixture of both.    Then there was the woman who went by the name of Mrs. Somebody or other  who wore a seal-skin coat, diamond earrings and silver-mounted umbrella.  She had been placed in the same stateroom with me on the steamer at  Seattle, and upon making her preparations to retire for the night had  offered me a glass of brandy, while imbibing one herself, which I  energetically, though politely, refused. At midnight a second woman of  the same caste had been ushered into my room to occupy the third and  last berth, whereupon next morning I had waited upon the purser of the  ship, and modestly but firmly requested a change of location. In a  gentlemanly way he informed me that the only vacant stateroom was a  small one next the engine room below, but if I could endure the noise  and wished to take it, I could do so. I preferred the proximity and  whirr of machinery along with closer quarters to the company of the two  adventuresses, so while both women slept late next morning I quietly and  thankfully moved all my belongings below. Here I enjoyed the luxury of a  room by myself for forty-eight hours, or until we reached Skagway,  completely oblivious to the fact that never for one instant did the  pounding of the great engines eight feet distant cease either day or  night.    [Illustration: DAWSON, Y. T.]    A United States Judge, an English aristocrat and lady, a Seattle lawyer,  sober, thoughtful and of middle age, who had been introduced to me by a  friend upon sailing, and who kindly kept me in sight when we changed  steamers or trains on the trip without specially appearing to do so; a  nice old gentleman going to search for the body of his son lost in the  Klondyke River a few weeks before, and a good many rough miners as well  as nondescripts made up our unique company to Dawson. Some had been over  the route before when mules and horses had been the only means of  transportation over the Passes, and stories of the trials and dangers of  former trips were heard upon deck each day, with accompaniments of oaths  and slang phrases, and punctuated by splashes of tobacco juice.    On the voyage to Skagway there was little seasickness among the  passengers, as we kept to the inland passage among the islands. At a  short distance away we viewed the great Treadwell gold mines on Douglass  Island, and peered out through a veil of mist and rain at Juneau under  the hills. Here we left a few of our best and most pleasant passengers,  and watched the old Indian women drive sharp bargains in curios, beaded  moccasins, bags, etc., with tourists who were impervious to the great  rain drops which are here always falling as easily from the clouds as  leaves from a maple tree in October.    Our landing at Skagway under the towering mountains upon beautiful Lynn  Canal was more uneventful than our experience in the Customs House at  that place, for we were about to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: FROM THE WIGWAM OF THE GREAT SPIRIT (page 2)]          THE BOOK OF NATURE MYTHS    BY FLORENCE HOLBROOK    PRINCIPAL OF FORESTVILLE SCHOOL, CHICAGO    [Illustration: Publishers Stamp]    HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY    BOSTON .

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED           The Riverside Press       CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS       PRINTED IN THE U.S.A          PREFACE.      In preparing the Book of Nature Myths the desire has been to make a  second reader which would be adapted to the child's interest, ability,  and progress.    The subject-matter is of permanent value, culled from the folk-lore of  the primitive races; the vocabulary, based upon that of the Hiawatha  Primer, is increased gradually, and the new words and phrases will add  to the child's power of expression. The naive explanations of the  phenomena of nature given by the primitive races appeal to the child's  wonder about the same phenomena, and he is pleased and interested. These  myths will gratify the child's desire for complete stories, and their  intrinsic merit makes them valuable for oral reproduction.    The stories have been adapted to youthful minds from myths contained in  the works of many students of folk-lore whose scholarship is undisputed.  Special acknowledgment is due Miss Eva March Tappan for her valuable  assistance in the final revision of the text.          CONTENTS.

THE STORY OF THE FIRST HUMMING-BIRD.      PART I. THE GREAT FIRE-MOUNTAIN.    Long, long ago, when the earth was very young, two hunters were  traveling through the forest. They had been on the track of a deer for  many days, and they were now far away from the village where they lived.  The sun went down and night came on. It was dark and gloomy, but over in  the western sky there came a bright light.    \"It is the moon,\" said one.    \"No,\" said the other. \"We have watched many and many a night to see the  great, round moon rise above the trees. That is not the moon. Is it the  northern lights?\"    \"No, the northern lights are not like this, and it is not a comet. What  can it be?\"    It is no wonder that the hunters were afraid, for the flames flared red  over the sky like a wigwam on fire. Thick, blue smoke floated above the  flames and hid the shining stars.    \"Do the flames and smoke come from the wigwam of the Great Spirit?\"  asked one.    \"I fear that he is angry with his children, and that the flames are his  fiery war-clubs,\" whispered the other. No sleep came to their eyes. All  night long they watched and wondered, and waited in terror for the  morning.    When morning came, the two hunters were still watching the sky. Little  by little they saw that there was a high mountain in the west where the  light had been, and above the mountain floated a dark blue smoke.  \"Come,\" said one, \"we will go and see what it is.\"    They walked and walked till they came close to the mountain, and then  they saw fire shining through the seams of the rocks. \"It is a mountain  of fire,\" one whispered. \"Shall we go on?\" \"We will,\" said the other,  and they went higher and higher up the mountain. At last they stood upon  its highest point. \"Now we know the secret,\" they cried. \"Our people  will be glad when they hear this.\"    Swiftly they went home through the forest to their own village. \"We have  found a wonder,\" they cried. \"We have found the home of the Fire Spirit.  We know where she keeps her flames to help the Great Spirit and his  children. It is a mountain of fire. Blue smoke rises above it night and  day, for its heart is a fiery sea, and on the sea the red flames leap  and dance. Come with us to the wonderful mountain of fire.\"    The people of the village had been cold in the winter nights, and they  cried, \"O brothers, your words are good. We will move our lodges to the  foot of the magic mountain. We can light our wigwam fires from its  flames, and we shall not fear that we shall perish in the long, cold  nights of winter.\"    So the Indians went to live at the foot of the fire-mountain, and when  the cold nights came, they said, \"We are not cold, for the Spirit of  Fire is our good friend, and she keeps her people from perishing.\"      PART II. THE FROLIC OF THE FLAMES.    For many and many a moon the people of the village lived at the foot of  the great fire-mountain. On summer evenings, the children watched the  light, and when a child asked, \"Father, what makes it?\" the father said,  \"That is the home of the Great Spirit of Fire, who is our good friend.\"  Then all in the little village went to sleep and lay safely on their  beds till the coming of the morning.    But one night when all the people in the village were asleep, the flames  in the mountain had a great frolic. They danced upon the sea of fire as  warriors dance the war-dance. They seized great rocks and threw them at  the sky. The smoke above them hid the stars; the mountain throbbed and  trembled. Higher and still higher sprang the dancing flames. At last,  they leaped clear above the highest point of the mountain and started  down it in a river of red fire. Then the gentle Spirit of Fire called,  \"Come back, my flames, come back again! The people in the village will  not know that you are in a frolic, and they will be afraid.\"    [Illustration]    The flames did not heed her words, and the river of fire ran on and on,  straight down the mountain. The flowers in its pathway perished. It  leaped upon great trees and bore them to the earth. It drove the birds  from their nests, and they fluttered about in the thick smoke. It hunted  the wild creatures of the forest from the thickets"]]]
