Printed in the United States of America  All Rights Reserved          To  DAVID STEPHEN          SUDDEN PANIC      It was a week before the Lhari ship went into warp-drive, and all that  time young Bart Steele had stayed in his cabin. He was so bored with his  own company that the Mentorian medic was a welcome sight when he came to  prepare him for _cold-sleep_.    The Mentorian paused, needle in hand. \"Do you wish to be wakened for the  time we shall spend in each of the three star systems, sir? You can, of  course, be given enough drug to keep you in cold-sleep until we reach  your destination.\"    Bart felt tempted--he wanted very much to see the other star systems.  But he couldn't risk meeting other passengers.    The needle went into his arm. In sudden panic, he realized he was  helpless. The ship would touch down on three worlds, and on any of them  the Lhari might have his description, or his alias! He could be taken  off, unconscious, and might never wake up! He tried to move, to protest,  but he couldn't. There was a freezing moment of intense cold and then  nothing....          CHAPTER ONE      The Lhari spaceport didn't belong on Earth.    Bart Steele had thought that, a long time ago, when he first saw it. He  had been just a kid then; twelve years old, and all excited about seeing  Earth for the first time--Earth, the legendary home of mankind before  the Age of Space, the planet of Bart's far-back ancestors. And the first  thing he'd seen on Earth, when he got off the starship, was the Lhari  spaceport.    And he'd thought, right then, _It doesn't belong on Earth._    He'd said so to his father, and his father's face had gone strange,  bitter and remote.    \"A lot of people would agree with you, Son,\" Captain Rupert Steele had  said softly. \"The trouble is, if the Lhari spaceport wasn't on Earth, we  wouldn't be on Earth either. Remember that.\"    Bart remembered it, five years later, as he got off the strip of moving  sidewalk. He turned to wait for Tommy Kendron, who was getting his  baggage off the center strip of the moving roadway. Bart Steele and  Tommy Kendron had graduated together, the day before, from the Space  Academy of Earth. Now Tommy, who had been born on the ninth planet of  the star Capella, was taking the Lhari starship to his faraway home, and  Bart's father was coming back to Earth, on the same starship, to meet  his son.    _Five years,_ Bart thought. _That's a long time. I wonder if Dad will  know me?_    \"Let me give you a hand with that stuff, Tommy.\"    \"I can manage,\" Tommy chuckled, hefting the plastic cases. \"They don't  allow you much baggage weight on the Lhari ships. Certainly not more  than I can handle.\"    The two lads stood in front of the spaceport gate for a minute. Over the  gate, which was high and pointed and made of some clear colorless  material like glass, was a jagged symbol resembling a flash of  lightning; the sign, in Lhari language, for the home world of the Lhari.    They walked through the pointed glass gate, and stood for a moment, by  mutual consent, looking down over the vast expanse of the Lhari  spaceport.    This had once been a great desert. Now it was all floored in with some  strange substance that was neither glass, metal nor concrete; it looked  like gleaming crystal--though it felt soft underfoot--and in the glare  of the noonday sun, it gave back the glare in a million rainbow flashes.  Tommy put his hands up to his eyes to shield them. \"The Lhari must have  funny eyes, if they can stand all this glare!\"    Inside the glass gate, a man in a guard's uniform gave them each a pair  of dark glasses. \"Put them on now, boys. And don't look directly at the  ship when it lands.\"    Tommy hooked the earpieces of the dark glasses over his ears, and sighed  with relief. Bart frowned, but finally put them on. Bart's mother had  been a Mentorian--from the planet Mentor, of the star Deneb, a hundred  times brighter than the sun. Bart had her eyes. But Mentorians weren't  popular on Earth, and Bart had learned to be quiet about his mother.    Through the dark lenses, the glare was only a pale gleam. Far out in the  very center of the spaceport, a high, clear-glass skyscraper rose,  catching the sunlight in a million colors. Around the building, small  copters and robotcabs veered, discharging passengers; and the moving  sidewalks were crowded with people coming and going. Here and there in  the crowd, standing out because of their height and the silvery metallic  cloaks they wore, were the strange tall figures of the Lhari.    \"Well, how about going down?\" Tommy glanced impatiently at his  timepiece. \"Less than half an hour before the starship touches down.\"    \"All right. We can get a sidewalk over here.\" Reluctantly, Bart tore his  eyes from the fascinating spectacle, and followed Tommy, stepping onto  one of the sidewalks. It bore them down a long, sloping ramp toward the  floor of the spaceport, then sped toward the glass skyscraper; came to  rest at the wide pointed doors, depositing them in the midst of the  crowd. The jagged lightning flash was there over the doors of the  building, and the words:         HERE, BY THE GRACE OF THE LHARI, IS THE DOORWAY TO ALL THE STARS.    Bart remembered, as if it were yesterday, how he and his father had  first passed through this doorway. And his father, looking up, had said  under his breath \"Not for always, Son. Someday men will have a doorway  to the stars, and the Lhari won't be standing in the door.\"    Inside the building, it was searingly bright. The high open rotunda was  filled with immense mirrors, and glass ramps running up and down, moving  staircases, confusing signs and flashing lights on tall oddly shaped  pillars. The place was crowded with men from all over the planet, but  the dark glasses they all wore gave them a strange sort of family  resemblance.    Tommy said, \"I'd better check my reservations.\"    Bart nodded. \"Meet you on the upper level later,\" he said, and got on a  moving staircase that soared slowly upward, past level after level,  toward the information desk located on the topmost mezzanine.    The staircase moved slowly, and Bart had plenty of time to see  everything. On the step immediately in front of him, two Lhari were  standing; with their backs turned, they might almost have been men.  Unusually tall, unusually thin, but men. Then Bart amended that  mentally. The Lhari had two arms, two legs and a head apiece--they were  that much like men. Their faces had two eyes, two ears, and a nose and  mouth, all in the right places. But the similarity ended there.    They had skin of a curious pale silvery gray, and pale, pure-white hair  rising in what looked like a feathery crest. The eyes were long and  slanting, the forehead high and narrow, the nose delicately thin and  chiseled with long vertically slit nostrils, the ears long, pointed and  lobeless. The mouth looked almost human, though the chin was abnormally  pointed. The hands would almost have passed inspection as human  hands--except for the long, triangular nails curved over the fingertips  like the claws of a cat. They wore skin-tight clothes of some metallic  silky stuff, and long flowing gleaming silvery capes. They looked  unearthly, elfin and strange, and in their own way they were beautiful.    The two Lhari in front of Bart had been talking softly, in their fast  twittering speech; but as the hum of the crowds on the upper levels grew  louder, they raised their voices, and Bart could hear what they were  saying. He was a little surprised to find that he could still understand  the Lhari language. He hadn't heard a word of it in years--not since his  Mentorian mother died. The Lhari would never guess that he could  understand their speech. Not one human in a million could speak or  understand a dozen words of Lhari, except the Mentorians.    \"Do you really think that _human_--\" the first Lhari spoke the word as  if it were a filthy insult--\"will have the temerity to come in by this  ship?\"    \"No reasonable being can tell what _humans_ will do,\" said the second  Lhari. \"But then, no reasonable being can tell what our own Port  Authorities will do either! If the message had only reached us sooner,  it would have been easier. Now I suppose it will have to clear through a  dozen officials and a dozen different kinds of formalities.\"    The younger Lhari sounded angry. \"And we have only a description--no  name, nothing! How do they expect us to do anything under those  conditions? What I can't understand is how it ever happened, or how the  man managed to get away. What worries me is the possibility that he may  have communicated with others we don't know about. Those bungling fools  who let the first man get away can't even be sure--\"    \"Do not speak of it here,\" said the old Lhari sharply. \"There are  Mentorians in the crowd who might understand us.\" He turned and looked  straight at Bart, and Bart felt as if the slanted strange eyes were  looking right through to his bones. The Lhari said, in Universal, \"Who  are you, boy? What iss your businesssses here?\"    Bart replied in the same language, politely, \"My father's coming in on  this ship. I'm looking for the information desk.\"    \"Up there,\" said the old Lhari, pointing with a clawed hand, and lost  interest in Bart.

The persona created is that of a woman  who always tells the truth as she sees it, but it is made clear to the  reader that what the narrator sees is very seldom exactly the objective  truth. The author ends as well as begins _in medias res_ (in the middle  of the action), thus creating an illusion of a slice of a journal but  simultaneously giving the reader the uneasy feeling that the first and  last chapters seem to be missing.    The French-style quotation marks have, for ease in typesetting and use,  been changed to American-style quotation marks, and the dot after the  name of Louis XV has been removed to conform to American punctuation.  Italics are indicated by placing _ _ around the word or phrase  italicized. Captions of illustrations are omitted because the  illustrations themselves cannot be inserted. A few minor editing errors  have been silently corrected. No other changes have been made; the  irregularity in italicizing or not italicizing, in translating or not  translating French words, and in punctuating quotations of letters, is  in the text itself.    Notes are identified as coming from author, tr. (translator), editor, or  Transcriber.
