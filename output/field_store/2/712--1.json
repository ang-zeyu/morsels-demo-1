Published April, 1917.          TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE      These Reminiscences were written and published by the Author in his  fiftieth year, shortly before he started on a trip to Europe and America  for his failing health in 1912. It was in the course of this trip that  he wrote for the first time in the English language for publication.    In these memory pictures, so lightly, even casually presented by the  author there is, nevertheless, revealed a connected history of his inner  life together with that of the varying literary forms in which his  growing self found successive expression, up to the point at which both  his soul and poetry attained maturity.    This lightness of manner and importance of matter form a combination the  translation of which into a different language is naturally a matter of  considerable difficulty. It was, in any case, a task which the present  Translator, not being an original writer in the English language, would  hardly have ventured to undertake, had there not been other  considerations. The translator's familiarity, however, with the  persons, scenes, and events herein depicted made it a temptation  difficult for him to resist, as well as a responsibility which he did  not care to leave to others not possessing these advantages, and  therefore more liable to miss a point, or give a wrong impression.    The Translator, moreover, had the author's permission and advice to make  a free translation, a portion of which was completed and approved by the  latter before he left India on his recent tour to Japan and America.    In regard to the nature of the freedom taken for the purposes of the  translation, it may be mentioned that those suggestions which might not  have been as clear to the foreign as to the Bengali reader have been  brought out in a slightly more elaborate manner than in the original  text; while again, in rare cases, others which depend on allusions  entirely unfamiliar to the non-Indian reader, have been omitted rather  than spoil by an over-elaboration the simplicity and naturalness which  is the great feature of the original.    There are no footnotes in the original. All the footnotes here given  have been added by the Translator in the hope that they may be of  further assistance to the foreign reader.

He takes in and leaves out according to his taste. He makes  many a big thing small and small thing big. He has no compunction in  putting into the background that which was to the fore, or bringing to  the front that which was behind. In short he is painting pictures, and  not writing history.    Thus, over Life's outward aspect passes the series of events, and within  is being painted a set of pictures. The two correspond but are not one.    We do not get the leisure to view thoroughly this studio within us.  Portions of it now and then catch our eye, but the greater part remains  out of sight in the darkness. Why the ever-busy painter is painting;  when he will have done; for what gallery his pictures are destined--who  can tell?    Some years ago, on being questioned as to the events of my past life, I  had occasion to pry into this picture-chamber. I had thought to be  content with selecting some few materials for my Life's story. I then  discovered, as I opened the door, that Life's memories are not Life's  history, but the original work of an unseen Artist. The variegated  colours scattered about are not reflections of outside lights, but  belong to the painter himself, and come passion-tinged from his heart;  thereby unfitting the record on the canvas for use as evidence in a  court of law.    But though the attempt to gather precise history from memory's  storehouse may be fruitless, there is a fascination in looking over the  pictures, a fascination which cast its spell on me.    The road over which we journey, the wayside shelter in which we pause,  are not pictures while yet we travel--they are too necessary, too  obvious. When, however, before turning into the evening resthouse, we  look back upon the cities, fields, rivers and hills which we have been  through in Life's morning, then, in the light of the passing day, are  they pictures indeed. Thus, when my opportunity came, did I look back,  and was engrossed.    Was this interest aroused within me solely by a natural affection for  my own past? Some personal feeling, of course, there must have been, but  the pictures had also an independent artistic value of their own. There  is no"]]]
