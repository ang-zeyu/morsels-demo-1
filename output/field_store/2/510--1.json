WASHINGTON,    NOVEMBER 14, 1918.  With the signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918, the World War  has been practically brought to an end. The events of the past four  years have been of such magnitude that the various steps, the numberless  battles, and the growth of Allied power which led up to the final  victory are not clearly defined even in the minds of many military men.  A history of this great period which will state in an orderly fashion  this series of events will be of the greatest value to the future  students of the war, and to everyone of the present day who desires to  refer in exact terms to matters which led up to the final conclusion.    The war will be discussed and re-discussed from every angle and the  sooner such a compilation of facts is available, the more valuable it  will be. I understand that this History of the World War intends to put  at the disposal of all who are interested, such a compendium of facts of  the past period of over four years; and that the system employed in  safeguarding the accuracy of statements contained in it will produce a  document of great historical value without entering upon any speculative  conclusions as to cause and effect of the various phases of the war or  attempting to project into an historical document individual opinions.  With these ends in view, this History will be of the greatest value.  Signature [Payton C. March]  General,  Chief of Staff.  United States Army.        CONTENTS    CHAPTER I.

Indeed it was time to leave--    Varta, last of the virgin Maidens of Asti, shivered. The scaled and  wattled creature who crouched beside her thigh turned his reptilian head  so that golden eyes met the aquamarine ones set slantingly at a faintly  provocative angle in her smooth ivory face.    \"We go--?\"    She nodded in answer to that unvoiced question Lur had sent into her  brain, and turned toward the dark cavern which was the mouth of Asti's  last dwelling place. Once, more than a thousand years before when the  walls of Memphir were young, Asti had lived among men below. But in the  richness and softness which was trading Memphir, empire of empires, Asti  found no place. So He and those who served Him had withdrawn to this  mountain outcrop. And she, Varta, was the last, the very last to bow  knee at Asti's shrine and raise her voice in the dawn hymn--for Lur, as  were all his race, was mute.    Even the loot of Memphir would not sate the shaggy headed warriors who  had stormed her gates this day. The stairway to Asti's Temple was plain  enough to see and there would be those to essay the steep climb hoping  to find a treasure which did not exist. For Asti was an austere God,  delighting in plain walls and bare altars. His last priest had lain in  the grave niches these three years, there would be none to hold that  gate against intruders.    Varta passed between tall, uncarved pillars, Lur padding beside her, his  spine mane erect, the talons on his forefeet clicking on the stone in  steady rhythm. So they came into the innermost shrine of Asti and there  Varta made graceful obeisance to the great cowled and robed figure which  sat enthroned, its hidden eyes focused upon its own outstretched hand.    And above the flattened palm of that wide hand hung suspended in space  the round orange-red sun ball which was twin to the sun that lighted  Erb. Around the miniature sun swung in their orbits the four worlds of  the system, each obeying the laws of space, even as did the planets they  represented.    \"Memphir has fallen,\" Varta's voice sounded rusty in her own ears. She  had spoken so seldom during the last lonely months. \"Evil has risen to  overwhelm our world, even as it was prophesied in Your Revelations, O,  Ruler of Worlds and Maker of Destiny. Therefore, obeying the order given  of old, I would depart from this, Thy house. Suffer me now to fulfill  the Law--\"    Three times she prostrated her slim body on the stones at the foot of  Asti's judgment chair. Then she arose and, with the confidence of a  child in its father, she laid her hand palm upward upon the outstretched  hand of Asti. Beneath her flesh the stone was not cold and hard, but  seemed to have an inner heat, even as might a human hand. For a long  moment she stood so and then she raised her hand slowly, carefully, as  if within its slight hollow she cupped something precious.    [Illustration]    And, as she drew her hand away from the grasp of Asti, the tiny sun and  its planets followed, spinning now above her palm as they had above the  statue's. But out of the cowled figure some virtue had departed with the  going of the miniature solar system; it was now but a carving of stone.  And Varta did not look at it again as she passed behind its bulk to seek  a certain place in the temple wall, known to her from much reading of  the old records.    Having found the stone she sought, she moved her hand in a certain  pattern before it so that the faint radiance streaming from the tiny  sun, gleamed on the grayness of the wall. There was a grating, as from  metal long unused, and a block fell back, opening a narrow door to them.    Before she stepped within, the priestess lifted her hand above her head  and when she withdrew it, the sun and planets remained to form a diadem  just above the intricate braiding of her dull red hair. As she moved  into the secret way, the five orbs swung with her, and in the darkness  there the sun glowed richly, sending out a light to guide their feet.    They were at the top of a stairway and the hollow clang of the stone as  it moved back into place behind them echoed through a gulf which seemed  endless. But that too was as the chronicles had said and Varta knew no  fear.    How long they journeyed down into the maw of the mountain and, beyond  that, into the womb of Erb itself, Varta never knew. But, when feet were  weary and she knew the bite of real hunger, they came into a passageway  which ended in a room hollowed of solid rock. And there, preserved in  the chest in which men born in the youth of Memphir had laid them, Varta  found that which would keep her safe on the path she must take. She put  aside the fine silks, the jeweled cincture, which had been the badge of  Asti's service and drew on over her naked body a suit of scaled skin,  gemmed and glistening in the rays of the small sun. There was a hood to  cover the entire head, taloned gloves for the hands, webbed, clawed  coverings for the feet--as if the skin of a giant, man-like lizard had  been tanned and fashioned into this suit. And Varta suspected that that  might be so--the world of Erb had not always been held by the human-kind  alone.    There were supplies here too, lying untouched in ageless containers  within a lizard-skin pouch. Varta touched her tongue without fear to a  powdered restorative, sharing it with Lur, whose own mailed skin would  protect him through the dangers to come.    She folded the regalia she had stripped off and laid it in the chest,  smoothing it regretfully before she dropped the lid upon its shimmering  color. Never again would Asti's servant wear the soft stuff of His  Livery. But she was resolute enough when she picked up the food pouch  and strode forward, passing out of the robing chamber into a narrow way  which was a natural fault in the rock unsmoothed by the tools of man.    But when this rocky road ended upon the lip of a gorge, Varta hesitated,  plucking at the throat latch of her hood-like helmet. Through the  unclouded crystal of its eye-holes she could see the sprouts of yellow  vapor which puffed from crannies in the rock wall down which she must  climb. If the records of the Temple spoke true, these curls of gas were  death to all lunged creatures of the upper world. She could only trust  that the cunning of the scaled hood would not fail her.    The long talons fitted to the finger tips of the gloves, the claws of  the webbed foot coverings clamped fast to every hand and foot hold, but  the way down was long and she caught a message of weariness from Lur  before they reached the piled rocks at the foot of the cliff. The puffs  of steamy gas had become a fog through which they groped their way  slowly, following a trace of path along the base of the cliff.    Time did not exist in the underworld of Erb. Varta did not know whether  it was still today, or whether she had passed into tomorrow when they  came to a cross roads. She felt Lur press against her, forcing her back  against a rock.    \"There is a thing coming--\" his message was clear.    And in a moment she too saw a dark hulk nosing through the vapor. It  moved slowly, seeming to balance at each step as if travel was a painful  act. But it bore steadily to the meeting of the two paths.    \"It is no enemy--\" But she did not need that reassurance from Lur.  Unearthly as the thing looked it had no menace.    With a last twist of ungainly body the creature squatted on a rock and  clawed the clumsy covering it wore about its bone-thin shoulders and  domed-skull head. The visage it revealed was long and gray, with dark  pits for eyes and a gaping, fang-studded, lipless mouth.    \"Who are you who dare to tread the forgotten ways and rouse from slumber  the Guardian of the Chasms?\"    The question was a shrill whine in her brain, her hands half arose to  cover her ears--    \"I am Varta, Maiden of Asti. Memphir has fallen to the barbarians of the  Outer Lands and now I go, as Asti once ordered--.\"    The Guardian considered her answer gravely. In one skeleton claw it  fumbled a rod and with this it now traced certain symbols in the dust  before Varta's webbed feet. When it had done, the girl stooped and  altered two of the lines with a swift stroke from one of her talons. The  creature of the Chasm nodded its misshapen head.    \"Asti does not rule here. But long, and long, and long ago there was a  pact made with us in His Name. Pass free from us, woman of the Light.  There are two paths before you--.\"    The Guardian paused for so long that Varta dared to prompt it.    \"Where do they lead, Guardian of the Dark?\"    \"This will take you down into my country,\" it jerked the rod to the  right. \"And that way is death for creatures from the surface world. The  other--in our old legends it is said to bring a traveler out into the  upper world. Of the truth of that I have no proof.\"    \"But that one I must take,\" she made slight obeisance to the huddle of  bones and dank cloak on the rock and it inclined its head in grave  courtesy.    With Lur pushing a little ahead, she took the road which ran straight  into the flume-v"]]]
