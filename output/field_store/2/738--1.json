ABBOTT, M.A.,      HEAD MASTER OF THE CITY OF LONDON SCHOOL.        [Illustration: QUI LEGIT REGIT]        THE AUTHOR'S COPYRIGHT EDITION.        BOSTON:    ROBERTS BROTHERS.    1883.      UNIVERSITY PRESS: JOHN WILSON & SON.    CAMBRIDGE.          PREFACE.      Almost every English boy can be taught to write clearly, so far at  least as clearness depends upon the arrangement of words. Force,  elegance, and variety of style are more difficult to teach, and far  more difficult to learn; but clear writing can be reduced to rules. To  teach the art of writing clearly is the main object of these Rules and  Exercises.    Ambiguity may arise, not only from bad arrangement, but also from  other causes--from the misuse of single words, and from confused  thought. These causes are not removable by definite rules, and  therefore, though not neglected, are not prominently considered in  this book. My object rather is to point out some few continually  recurring causes of ambiguity, and to suggest definite remedies in  each case. Speeches in Parliament, newspaper narratives and articles,  and, above all, resolutions at public meetings, furnish abundant  instances of obscurity arising from the monotonous neglect of some  dozen simple rules.    The art of writing forcibly is, of course, a valuable  acquisition--almost as valuable as the art of writing clearly. But  forcible expression is not, like clear expression, a mere question of  mechanism and of the manipulation of words; it is a much higher power,  and implies much more.    Writing clearly does not imply thinking clearly. A man may think and  reason as obscurely as Dogberry himself, but he may (though it is not  probable that he will) be able to write clearly for all that. Writing  clearly--so far as arrangement of words is concerned--is a mere matter  of adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, and auxiliary verbs, placed  and repeated according to definite rules.[1] Even obscure or illogical  thought can be clearly expressed; indeed, the transparent medium of  clear writing is not least beneficial when it reveals the illogical  nature of the meaning beneath it.    On the other hand, if a man is to write forcibly, he must (to use a  well-known illustration) describe Jerusalem as \"sown with salt,\" not  as \"captured,\" and the Jews not as being \"subdued\" but as \"almost  exterminated\" by Titus. But what does this imply? It implies  knowledge, and very often a great deal of knowledge, and it implies  also a vivid imagination. The writer must have eyes to see the vivid  side of everything, as well as words to describe what he sees. Hence  forcible writing, and of course tasteful writing also, is far less a  matter of rules than is clear writing; and hence, though forcible  writing is exemplified in the exercises, clear writing occupies most  of the space devoted to the rules.    Boys who are studying Latin and Greek stand in especial need of help  to enable them to write a long English sentence clearly. The periods  of Thucydides and Cicero are not easily rendered into our idiom  without some knowledge of the links that connect an English sentence.    There is scarcely any better training, rhetorical as well as logical,  than the task of construing Thucydides into genuine English; but the  flat, vague, long-winded Greek-English and Latin-English imposture  that is often tolerated in our examinations and is allowed to pass  current for genuine English, diminishes instead of increasing the  power that our pupils should possess over their native language. By  getting marks at school and college for construing good Greek and  Latin into bad English, our pupils systematically unlearn what they  may have been allowed to pick up from Milton and from Shakespeare.    I must acknowledge very large obligations to Professor Bain's treatise  on \"English Composition and Rhetoric,\" and also to his English  Grammar. I have not always been able to agree with Professor Bain as  to matters of taste; but I find it difficult to express my admiration  for the systematic thoroughness and suggestiveness of his book on  Composition. In particular, Professor Bain's rule on the use of \"that\"  and \"which\" (see Rule 8) deserves to be better known.[2] The ambiguity  produced by the confusion between these two forms of the Relative is  not a mere fiction of pedants; it is practically serious. Take, for  instance, the following sentence, which appeared lately in one of our  ablest weekly periodicals: \"There are a good many Radical members in  the House _who_ cannot forgive the Prime Minister for being a  Christian.\" Twenty years hence, who is to say whether the meaning is  \"_and they_, i.e. _all the Radical_ members in the House,\" or \"there  are a good many Radical members of the House _that_ cannot &c.\"?  Professor Bain, apparently admitting no exceptions to his useful rule,  amends many sentences in a manner that seems to me intolerably harsh.  Therefore, while laying due stress on the utility of the rule, I have  endeavoured to point out and explain the exceptions.    The rules are stated as briefly as possible, and are intended not so  much for use by themselves as for reference while the pupil is working  at the exercises. Consequently, there is no attempt to prove the rules  by accumulations of examples. The few examples that are given, are  given not to prove, but to illustrate the rules. The exercises are  intended to be written out and revised, as exercises usually are; but  they may also be used for _viva voce_ instruction. The books being  shut, the pupils, with their written exercises before them, may be  questioned as to the reasons for the several alterations they have  made. Experienced teachers will not require any explanation of the  arrangement or rather non-arrangement of the exercises. They have been  purposely mixed together unclassified to prevent the pupil from  relying upon anything but his own common sense and industry, to show  him what is the fault in each case, and how it is to be amended.  Besides references to the rules, notes are attached to each sentence,  so that the exercises ought not to present any difficulty to a  painstaking boy of twelve or thirteen, provided he has first been  fairly trained in English grammar.    The \"Continuous Extracts\" present rather more difficulty, and are  intended for boys somewhat older than those for whom the Exercises are  intended. The attempt to modernize, and clarify, so to speak, the  style of Burnet, Clarendon, and Bishop Butler,[3] may appear  ambitious, and perhaps requires some explanation. My object has, of  course, not been to _improve upon_ the style of these authors, but to  show how their meaning might be expressed more clearly in modern  English. The charm of the style is necessarily lost, but if the loss  is recognized both by teacher and pupil, there is nothing, in my  opinion, to counterbalance the obvious utility of such exercises.  Professor Bain speaks to the same effect:[4] \"For an English exercise,  the matter should in some way or other be supplied, and the pupil  disciplined in giving it expression. I know of no better method than  to prescribe passages containing good matter, but in some respects  imperfectly worded, to be amended according to the laws and the  proprieties of style. Our older writers might be extensively, though  not exclusively, drawn upon for this purpose.\"    To some of the friends whose help has been already acknowledged in  \"English Lessons for English People,\" I am indebted for further help  in revising these pages. I desire to express especial obligations to  the Rev. J. H. Lupton, late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge,  and Second Master of St. Paul's School, for copious and valuable  suggestions; also to several of my colleagues at the City of London  School, among whom I must mention in particular the Rev. A. R. Vardy,  Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.           *       *       *       *       *    Before electrotyping the Fourth and Revised Edition, I wish to say one  word as to the manner in which this book has been used by my highest  class, as a collection of Rules for reference in their construing  lessons. In construing, from Thucydides especially, I have found Rules  5, 30, 34, 36, 37, and 40_a_, of great use. The rules about Metaphor  and Climax have also been useful in correcting faults of taste in  their Latin and Greek compositions. I have hopes that, used in this  way, this little book may be of service to the highest as well as to  the middle classes of our schools.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Punctuation is fully discussed in most English Grammars, and is  therefore referred to in this book only so far as is necessary to  point out the slovenly fault of trusting too much to punctuation, and  too little to arrangement.    [2] Before meeting with Professor Bain's rule, I had shown that the  difference between the Relatives is generally observed by Shakespeare.  See \"Shakespearian Grammar,\" paragraph 259.    [3] Sir Archibald Alison stands on a very different footing. The  extracts from this author are intended to exhibit the dangers of  verbosity and exaggeration.

A Paper Read at the Cincinnati Meeting of the American Association for  the Advancement of Science, in August, 1881, under the Title of \"A  Lawgiver of the Stone Age.\"                Salem, Mass.:  Printed at the Salem Press.  1881.          A LAWGIVER OF THE STONE AGE.  By HORATIO HALE, of Clinton, Ontario,  Canada.      What was the intellectual capacity of man when he made his first  appearance upon the earth?  Or, to speak with more scientific precision  (as the question relates to material evidences), what were the mental  powers of the people who fashioned the earliest stone implements, which  are admitted to be the oldest remaining traces of our kind?  As these  people were low in the arts of life, were they also low in natural  capacity?  This is certainly one of the most important questions which  the science of anthropology has yet to answer.  Of late years the  prevalent disposition has apparently been to answer it in the  affirmative.  Primitive man, we are to believe, had a feeble and narrow  intellect, which in the progress of civilization has been gradually  strengthened and enlarged.  This conclusion is supposed to be in  accordance with the development theory; and the distinguished author of  that theory has seemed to favor this view.  Yet, in fact, the development  theory has nothing to do with the question.  If we suppose that the  existing and--so far as we know--the only species of man appeared upon  the earth with the physical conformation and mental capacity which he  retains at this day, we make merely the same supposition with regard to  him that we make with regard to every other existing species of animal.  How it was that this species came to exist is another question altogether.    Philologists regard it as an established fact that the first people who  spoke an Aryan language were a tribe of barbarous nomads, who wandered in  the highlands of central Asia.  Those who have studied the earliest  products of Aryan genius in the Vedas, the Zend-Avesta, and the Homeric  songs, will be willing to admit that these wandering barbarians may have  had minds capable of the highest efforts to which the human intellect is  known to have attained.  Yet if an irruption of Semitic or Turanian  conquerors had swept that infant tribe from the earth, no trace of its  existence beyond a few flint implements, and perhaps some fragments of  pottery, would have remained to show that such a people had ever existed.  Have we any reason to doubt that in the course of all the ages, in  various parts of our globe, many tribes of men may have arisen and  perished who were in natural capacity as far superior to the primitive  Aryans as these were to the races who surrounded them?  Under the law of  the survival of the fittest, it is not the strongest that survive, but  the strongest of those that are placed in the most favorable  circumstances.  On any calculation of probabilities, it will seem likely  enough that among the numberless small societies of men that have  appeared and vanished in primeval Asia and Europe, in Africa, Australia,  America, and Polynesia, there may have been some at least equal, if not  superior, in mental endowments, to that fortunate tribe of central Asia,  whose posterity has come to be the dominant race of our time.  Among  their leaders may have been men qualified to rank with the most renowned  heroes, exemplars, and teachers of the human race--with Moses and Buddha,  with Confucius and Solon, with Numa, Charlemagne, and Alfred, or (to come  down to recent times) with the greatest and wisest among the founders of  the American Republic.  If the possibility of the existence of such men  under such conditions cannot be denied, the facts which have lately been  brought to light in regard to one such personage and the community in  which he lived may have a peculiar interest and significance in their  bearing on the general question of the mental capacity of uncivilized  races.    It is well known that the Iroquois tribes, whom our ancestors termed the  Five Nations, were, when first visited by Europeans, in the precise  condition which, according to all the evidence we possess, was held by  the inhabitants of the Old World during what has been designated the  Stone Age.  Any one who examines the abandoned site of an ancient  Iroquois town will find there relics of precisely the same cast as those  which are disinterred from the burial mounds and caves of prehistoric  Europe,--implements of flint and bone, ornaments of shells, and fragments  of rude pottery.  Trusting to these evidences alone, he might suppose  that the people who wrought them were of the humblest grade of intellect.  But the testimony of historians, of travellers, of missionaries, and  perhaps his own personal observation, would make him aware that this  opinion would be erroneous, and that these Indians were, in their own  way, acute reasoners, eloquent speakers, and most skilful and far-seeing  politicians.  He would know that for more than a century, though never  mustering more than five thousand fighting men, they were able to hold  the balance of power on this continent between France and England; and  that in a long series of negotiations they proved themselves qualified to  cope in council with the best diplomatists whom either of those powers  could depute to deal with them.  It is only recently that we have  learned, through the researches of a careful and philosophic  investigator, the Hon. L. H. Morgan, that their internal polity was  marked by equal wisdom, and had been developed and consolidated into a  system of government, embodying many of what are deemed the best  principles and methods of political science,--representation, federation,  self-government through local and general legislatures,--all resulting in  personal liberty, combined with strict subordination to public law.  But  it has not been distinctly known that for many of these advantages the  Five Nations were indebted to one individual, who bore to them the same  relation which the great reformers and lawgivers of antiquity bore to the  communities whose gratitude has made their names illustrious.    A singular fortune has attended the name and memory of Hiawatha.  Though  actually an historical personage, and not of very ancient date, of whose  life and deeds many memorials remain, he has been confused with two  Indian divinities, the one Iroquois, the other Algonquin, and his history  has been distorted and obscured almost beyond recognition.  Through the  cloud of mythology which has enveloped his memory, the genius of  Longfellow has discerned something of his real character, and has made  his name, at least, a household word wherever the English language is  spoken.  It remains to give a correct account of the man himself and of  the work which he accomplished, as it has been received from the official  annalists of his people.  The narrative is confirmed by the evidence of  contemporary wampum records, and by written memorials in the native  tongue, one of which is at least a hundred years old.    According to the best evidence that can be obtained, the formation of the  Iroquois confederacy dates from about the middle of the fifteenth  century.  There is reason to believe that prior to that time the five  tribes, who are dignified with the title of nations, had held the region  south of Lake Ontario, extending from the Hudson to the Genesee river,  for many generations, and probably for many centuries.  Tradition makes  their earlier seat to have been north of the St. Lawrence river, which is  probable enough.  It also represents the Mohawks as the original tribe,  of which the others are offshoots; and this tradition is confirmed by the  evidence of language.  That the Iroquois tribes were originally one  people, and that their separation into five communities, speaking  distinct dialects, dates many centuries back, are both conclusions as  certain as any facts in physical science.  Three hundred and fifty years  ago they were isolated tribes, at war occasionally with one another, and  almost constantly with the fierce Algonquins who surrounded them.  Not  unfrequently, also, they had to withstand and to avenge the incursions of  warriors belonging to more distant tribes of various stocks, Hurons,  Cherokees and Dakotas.  Yet they were not peculiarly a warlike people.  They were a race of housebuilders, farmers, and fishermen.  They had  large and strongly palisaded towns, well-cultivated fields, and  substantial houses, sometimes a hundred feet long, in which many kindred  families dwelt together.    At this time two great dangers, the one from without, the other from  within, pressed upon these tribes.  The Mohegans, or Mohicans, a powerful  Algonquin people, whose settlements stretched along the Hudson river,  south of the Mohawks, and extended thence eastward into New England,  waged a desperate war against them.  In this war the most easterly of the  Iroquois, the Mohawks and Oneidas, bore the brunt and were the greatest  sufferers.  On the other hand, the two westerly nations, the Senecas and  Cayugas, had a peril of their own to encounter.  The central nation, the  Onondagas, were then under the control of a dreaded chief, whose name is  variously given, Atotarho, Watatotahlo, Tododaho, according to the  dialect of the speaker and the orthography of the writer.  He was a man  of great force of character and of formidable qualities,--haughty,  ambitious, crafty and bold,--a determined and successful warrior, and at  home, so far as the constitution of "]]]
