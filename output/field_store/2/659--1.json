THE BIRD STUDY BOOK    by    T. GILBERT PEARSON    Secretary, National Association of Audubon Societies    Coloured Frontispiece    Pen and ink drawings by Will Simmons    And sixteen photographs                [Frontispiece: Wood Thrush]        Garden City ------ New York  Doubleday, Page & Company  1917  Copyright, 1917, by  Doubleday, Page & Company  All rights reserved, including that of translation into foreign  languages, including the Scandinavian          TO MY WIFE    ELSIE WEATHERLY PEARSON          {v}    PREFACE    This book has been written for the consideration of that ever-increasing  class of Americans who are interested in acquiring a greater familiarity  with the habits and activities of wild birds.  There are many valuable  publications treating more or less exhaustively of the classification of  birds, as well as of form, colour, distribution, migration, songs, and  foods.  Here an attempt is made to place before the reader a brief  consideration of these and many similar topics, and suggest lines of  action and thought that may perhaps stimulate a fuller study of the  subject.  Attention is also given to the relation of birds to mankind and  the effect of civilisation on the bird-life of the country.  The book is  not intended so much for the advanced student in ornithology, as for the  beginner.  Its purpose is to answer many of the questions that students  in this charming field of outdoor study are constantly asking of those  more advanced in bird-lore.  In conformity with the custom employed  during many years of college and summer-school teaching, the author has  discussed numerous details of field observation, the importance of which  is so often overlooked by writers on the subject.    If one can, in the recounting of some experience that he has found  interesting, awaken in the mind of a sympathetic hearer a desire to go  forth and acquire a similar experience, then indeed may he regard himself  as a worthy disciple of the immortal Pestalozzi.  Let the teacher who  would instruct pupils in bird-study first acquire, therefore, that love  for the subject which is sure to come when one begins to learn the birds  and observe their movements.  This book, it is hoped, will aid such  seekers after truth by the simple means of pointing out some of the  interesting things that may be sought and readily found in the field and  by the open road.    In the preparation of this volume much valuable aid has been received  from Messrs. E. W. Nelson, F. E. L. Beal, Wells W. Cooke, T. S. Palmer,  H. C. Oberholser, and others of the United States Biological Survey, for  which the author desires to make grateful acknowledgment.

BY EGERTON RYERSON, D.D., LL.D.,    _Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada from 1844 to 1876._    IN TWO VOLUMES.    VOL. I.    TORONTO:  WILLIAM BRIGGS, 80 KING STREET EAST;  JAMES CAMPBELL & SON, AND  WILLING & WILLIAMSON.  MONTREAL: DAWSON BROTHERS.  1880.    ENTERED, according to the Act of the Parliament of Canada, in the year  One thousand eight hundred and eighty, by the REV. EGERTON RYERSON,  D.D., LL.D., in the Office of the Minister of Agriculture.          PREFACE.      As no Indian pen has ever traced the history of the aborigines of  America, or recorded the deeds of their chieftains, their \"prowess and  their wrongs\"--their enemies and spoilers being their historians; so the  history of the Loyalists of America has never been written except by  their enemies and spoilers, and those English historians who have not  troubled themselves with examining original authorities, but have  adopted the authorities, and in some instances imbibed the spirit, of  American historians, who have never tired in eulogizing Americans and  everything American, and deprecating everything English, and all who  have loyally adhered to the unity of the British Empire.    I have thought that the other side of the story should be written; or,  in other words, the true history of the relations, disputes, and  contests between Great Britain and her American colonies and the United  States of America.    The United Empire Loyalists were the losing party; their history has  been written by their adversaries, and strangely misrepresented. In the  vindication of their character, I have not opposed assertion against  assertion; but, in correction of unjust and untrue assertions, I have  offered the records and documents of the actors themselves, and in their  own words. To do this has rendered my history, to a large extent,  _documentary_, instead of being a mere popular narrative. The many  fictions of American writers will be found corrected and exposed in the  following volumes, by authorities and facts which cannot be successfully  denied. In thus availing myself so largely of the proclamations,  messages, addresses, letters, and records of the times when they  occurred, I have only followed the example of some of the best  historians and biographers.    No one can be more sensible than myself of the imperfect manner in which  I have performed my task, which I commenced more than a quarter of a  century since, but I have been prevented from completing it sooner by  public duties--pursuing, as I have done from the beginning, an untrodden  path of historical investigations. From the long delay, many supposed I  would never complete the work, or that I had abandoned it. On its  completion, therefore, I issued a circular, an extract from which I  hereto subjoin, explaining the origin, design, and scope of the work:--         \"I have pleasure in stating that I have at length completed the       task which the newspaper press and public men of different parties       urged upon me from 1855 to 1860. In submission to what seemed to be       public opinion, I issued, in 1861, a circular addressed to the       United Empire Loyalists and their descendants, of the British       Provinces of America, stating the design and scope of my proposed       work, and requesting them to transmit to me, at my expense, any       letters or papers in their possession which would throw light upon       the early history and settlement in these Provinces by our U.E.       Loyalist forefathers. From all the British Provinces I received       answers to my circular; and I have given, with little abridgment,       in one chapter of my history, these intensely interesting letters       and papers--to which I have been enabled to add considerably from       two large quarto manuscript volumes of papers relating to the U.E.       Loyalists in the Dominion Parliamentary Library at Ottawa, with the       use of which I have been favoured by the learned and obliging       librarian, Mr. Todd.         \"In addition to all the works relating to the subject which I could       collect in Europe and America, I spent, two years since, several       months in the Library of the British Museum, employing the       assistance of an amanuensis, in verifying quotations and making       extracts from works not to be found elsewhere, in relation       especially to unsettled questions involved in the earlier part of       my history.         \"I have entirely sympathized with the Colonists in their       remonstrances, and even use of arms, in defence of British       constitutional rights, from 1763 to 1776; but I have been compelled       to view the proceedings of the Revolutionists and their treatment       of the Loyalists in a very different light.         \"After having compared the conduct of the two parties during the       Revolution, the exile of the Loyalists from their homes after the       close of the War, and their settlement in the British Provinces, I       have given a brief account of the government of each Province, and       then traced the alleged and real causes of the War of 1812-1815,       together with the courage, sacrifice, and patriotism of Canadians,       both English and French, in defending our country against eleven       successive American invasions, when the population of the two       Canadas was to that of the United States as one to twenty-seven,       and the population of Upper Canada (the chief scene of the War) was       as one to one hundred and six. Our defenders, aided by a few       English regiments, were as handfuls, little Spartan bands, in       comparison of the hosts of the invading armies; and yet at the end       of two years, as well as at the end of the third and last year of       the War, not an invader's foot found a place on the soil of Canada.         \"I undertook this work not self-moved and with no view to profit;       and if I receive no pecuniary return from this work, on which I       have expended no small labour and means, I shall have the       satisfaction of having done all in my power to erect an historical       monument to the character and merits of the fathers and founders of       my native country.\"    E.
