JOHN LANG)     WITH SIXTEEN ORIGINAL    DRAWINGS IN COLOUR     BY HELEN STRATTON          [Illustration]       THOMAS NELSON & SONS         NEW YORK          PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA          [Illustration: \"WHAT WAS HE DOING, THE GREAT GOD PAN, DOWN IN THE  REEDS BY THE RIVER?\" (See page 209)]          PREFACE      Just as a little child holds out its hands to catch the sunbeams, to  feel and to grasp what, so its eyes tell it, is actually there, so,  down through the ages, men have stretched out their hands in eager  endeavour to know their God. And because only through the human was  the divine knowable, the old peoples of the earth made gods of their  heroes and not unfrequently endowed these gods with as many of the  vices as of the virtues of their worshippers. As we read the myths of  the East and the West we find ever the same story. That portion of the  ancient Aryan race which poured from the central plain of Asia,  through the rocky defiles of what we now call \"The Frontier,\" to  populate the fertile lowlands of India, had gods who must once have  been wholly heroic, but who came in time to be more degraded than the  most vicious of lustful criminals. And the Greeks, Latins, Teutons,  Celts, and Slavonians, who came of the same mighty Aryan stock, did  even as those with whom they owned a common ancestry. Originally they  gave to their gods of their best. All that was noblest in them, all  that was strongest and most selfless, all the higher instincts of  their natures were their endowment. And although their worship in time  became corrupt and lost its beauty, there yet remains for us, in the  old tales of the gods, a wonderful humanity that strikes a vibrant  chord in the hearts of those who are the descendants of their  worshippers. For though creeds and forms may change, human nature  never changes. We are less simple than our fathers: that is all. And,  as Professor York Powell[1] most truly says: \"It is not in a man's  creed, but in his deeds; not in his knowledge, but in his sympathy,  that there lies the essence of what is good and of what will last in  human life.\"    The most usual habits of mind in our own day are the theoretical and  analytical habits. Dissection, vivisection, analysis--those are the  processes to which all things not conclusively historical and all  things spiritual are bound to pass. Thus we find the old myths  classified into Sun Myths and Dawn Myths, Earth Myths and Moon Myths,  Fire Myths and Wind Myths, until, as one of the most sane and vigorous  thinkers of the present day[2] has justly observed: \"If you take the  rhyme of Mary and her little lamb, and call Mary the sun and the lamb  the moon, you will achieve astonishing results, both in religion and  astronomy, when you find that the lamb followed Mary to school one  day.\"    In this little collection of Myths, the stories are not presented to  the student of folklore as a fresh contribution to his knowledge.  Rather is the book intended for those who, in the course of their  reading, frequently come across names which possess for them no  meaning, and who care to read some old stories, through which runs the  same humanity that their own hearts know. For although the old worship  has passed away, it is almost impossible for us to open a book that  does not contain some mention of the gods of long ago. In our  childhood we are given copies of Kingsley's _Heroes_ and of  Hawthorne's _Tanglewood Tales_. Later on, we find in Shakespeare,  Spenser, Milton, Keats, Shelley, Longfellow, Tennyson, Mrs. Browning,  and a host of other writers, constant allusion to the stories of the  gods. Scarcely a poet has ever written but makes mention of them in  one or other of his poems. It would seem as if there were no get-away  from them. We might expect in this twentieth century that the old gods  of Greece and of Rome, the gods of our Northern forefathers, the gods  of Egypt, the gods of the British race, might be forgotten. But even  when we read in a newspaper of aeroplanes, someone is more than likely  to quote the story of Bellerophon and his winged steed, or of Icarus,  the flyer, and in our daily speech the names of gods and goddesses  continually crop up. We drive--or, at least, till lately we drove--in  Phaetons. Not only schoolboys swear by Jove or by Jupiter. The silvery  substance in our thermometers and barometers is named Mercury.  Blacksmiths are accustomed to being referred to as \"sons of Vulcan,\"  and beautiful youths to being called \"young Adonises.\" We accept the  names of newspapers and debating societies as being the \"Argus,\"  without perhaps quite realising who was Argus, the many-eyed. We talk  of \"a panic,\" and forget that the great god Pan is father of the word.  Even in our religious services we go back to heathenism. Not only are  the crockets on our cathedral spires and church pews remnants of  fire-worship, but one of our own most beautiful Christian blessings is  probably of Assyrian origin. \"The Lord bless thee and keep thee....  The Lord make His face to shine upon thee.... The Lord lift up the  light of His countenance upon thee....\" So did the priests of the  sun-gods invoke blessings upon those who worshipped.    We make many discoveries as we study the myths of the North and of the  South. In the story of Baldur we find that the goddess Hel ultimately  gave her name to the place of punishment precious to the Calvinistic  mind. And because the Norseman very much disliked the bitter, cruel  cold of the long winter, his heaven was a warm, well-fired abode, and  his place of punishment one of terrible frigidity. Somewhere on the  other side of the Tweed and Cheviots was the spot selected by the Celt  of southern Britain. On the other hand, the eastern mind, which knew  the terrors of a sun-smitten land and of a heat that was torture, had  for a hell a fiery place of constantly burning flames.    In the space permitted, it has not been possible to deal with more  than a small number of myths, and the well-known stories of Herakles,  of Theseus, and of the Argonauts have been purposely omitted. These  have been so perfectly told by great writers that to retell them would  seem absurd. The same applies to the Odyssey and the Iliad, the  translations of which probably take rank amongst the finest  translations in any language.    The writer will feel that her object has been gained should any  readers of these stories feel that for a little while they have left  the toilful utilitarianism of the present day behind them, and, with  it, its hampering restrictions of sordid actualities that are so  murderous to imagination and to all romance.        \"Great God! I'd rather be      A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;      So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,      Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;      Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;      Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.\"            JEAN LANG.      POSTSCRIPT    We have come, in those last long months, to date our happenings as  they have never until now been dated by those of our own generation.    We speak of things that took place \"_Before the War_\"; and between  that time and this stands a barrier immeasurable.    This book, with its Preface, was completed in 1914--\"_Before the  War._\"    Since August 1914 the finest humanity of our race has been enduring  Promethean agonies. But even as Prometheus unflinchingly bore the  cruelties of pain, of heat and of cold, of hunger and of thirst, and  the tortures inflicted by an obscene bird of prey, so have endured the  men of our nation and of those nations with whom we are proud to be  allied. Much more remote than they seemed one little year ago, now  seem the old stories of sunny Greece. But if we have studied the  strange transmogrification of the ancient gods, we can look with  interest, if with horror, at the Teuton representation of the GOD in  whom we believe as a GOD of perfect purity, of honour, and of love.  According to their interpretation of Him, the God of the Huns would  seem to be as much a confederate of the vicious as the most degraded  god of ancient worship. And if we turn with shame from the Divinity so  often and so glibly referred to by blasphemous lips, and look on a  picture that tears our hearts, and yet makes our hearts big with  pride, we can understand how it was that those heroes who fought and  died in the Valley of the Scamander came in time to be regarded not as  men, but as gods.    There is no tale in all the world's mythology finer than the tale that  began in August 1914. How future generations will tell the tale, who  can say?    But we, for whom Life can never be the same again, can say with all  earnestness: \"It is the memory that the soldier leaves behind him,  like the long train of light that follows the sunken sun--that is all  which is worth caring for, which distinguishes the death of the brave  or the ignoble.\"    And, surely, to all those who are fighting, and suffering, and dying  for a noble cause, the GOD of gods, the GOD of battles, who is also  the GOD of peace, and the GOD of Love, has become an ever near and  eternally living entity.        \"Our little systems have their day;      They have their day and cease to be,      They are but broken lights of Thee,      And Thou, oh Lord, art more than they.\"            JEAN LANG.

[Illustration]    EDMUND BURKE.      Edmund Burke is the most illustrious name in the political history of  England. The exploits of Marlborough are forgotten, as Wellington's will  be, while the wisdom and genius of Burke live in the memory, and form a  portion of the virtue and intelligence of the British nation and the  British race. The reflection of this superior power and permanence of  moral grandeur over that which, at best, is but a vulgar renown,  justifies the most sanguine expectations of humanity.    It may be said of Burke, as it was said by him of another, that \"his  mind was generous, open, sincere; his manners plain, simple, and noble;  rejecting all sorts of duplicity and disguise, as useless to his  designs, and odious to his nature. His understanding was comprehensive,  steady, and vigorous, made for the practical business of the state....  His knowledge, in all things which concerned his duty was profound....  He was not more respectable on the public scene, than amiable in private  life.... A husband and a father, the kindest, gentlest, most indulgent,  he was every thing in his family, except what he gave up to his  country.... An ornament and blessing to the age in which he lived, his  memory will continue to be beneficial to mankind, by holding forth an  example of pure and unaffected virtue, most worthy of imitation, to the  latest posterity.\"    In the last of a series of articles by Mrs. S. C. Hall, entitled  \"Pilgrimages to English Shrines,\" and published in the London _Art  Journal_, we have an account of a visit to the residences and to the  grave of Burke, which we reproduce in the following pages, with its  interesting illustrations.      THE GRAVE OF EDMUND BURKE.    It has been said that we are inclined to over-value great men when their  graves have been long green, or their monuments gray above them, but we  believe it is only then we estimate them as they deserve. Prejudice and  falsehood have no enduring vitality, and posterity is generally anxious  to render justice to the mighty dead; we dwell upon their actions,--we  quote their sentiments and opinions,--we class them amongst our  household gods--and keep their memories green within the sanctuary of  our HOMES; we read to our children and friends the written treasures  bequeathed to us by the genius and independence of the great statesmen  and orators--the men of literature and science--who \"_have been_.\" We  adorn our minds with the poetry of the past, and value it, as well we  may, as far superior to that of the present: we sometimes, by the aid of  imagination--one of the highest of God's gifts--bring great men before  us: we hear the deep-toned voices and see the flashing eyes of some,  who, it may be, taught kings their duty, or quelled the tumults of a  factious people: we listen to the lay of the minstrel, or the orator's  addresses to the assembly, and our pulses throb and our eyes moisten as  the eloquence flows--first, as a gentle river, until gaining strength in  its progress, it sweeps onwards like a torrent, overcoming all that  sought to impede its progress. What a happy power this is!--what a  glorious triumph over time!--recalling or creating at will!--peopling  our small chamber with the demigods of history; viewing them enshrined  in their perfections, untainted by the world; hearing their exalted  sentiments; knowing them as we know a noble statue or a beautiful  picture, without the taint of age or feebleness, or the mildew of decay.    If these sweet wakening dreams were more frequent, we should be happier;  yes, and better than we are; we should be shamed out of much  baseness--for nothing so purifies and exalts the soul as the actual or  imaginary companionship of the pure and exalted; no man who purposed to  create a noble picture would choose an imperfect model; no one who seeks  virtue and cherishes honor and honorable things, will endure the  degradation of ignoble persons or ignoble thoughts; no one ever achieved  a great purpose who did not plant his standard on high ground.    A little before the commencement of the present century, England was  rich in orators, and poets, and men of letters; the times were favorable  to such--events called them forth--and there was still a lingering  chivalric feeling in our island which the utilitarian principles or  tastes of the present period would now treat with neglect, if not  contempt.    The progress of the French Revolution agitated Europe; and men wondered  if the young Corsican would ever dare to wield the sceptre wrenched from  the grasp of a murdered king; people were continually on the watch for  fresh events; great stakes were played for all over Europe, and those  who desired change were full of hope. It was an age to create great men.    Let us then indulge in visions of those, who, in more recent times than  we have yet touched upon,--save in one or two PILGRIMAGES,--illumed the  later days of the last century; and, brightest and purest of the galaxy  was the orator, EDMUND BURKE. Ireland, which gave him birth, may well be  proud of the high-souled and high-gifted man, who united in himself all  the great qualities which command attention in the senate and the world,  and all the domestic virtues that sanctify home; grasping a knowledge of  all things, and yet having that sweet sympathy with the small things of  life, which at once bestows and secures happiness, and, in the end,  popularity.    EDMUND BURKE was born on Arran Quay, Dublin, January the 1st, 1730; his  father was an attorney: the name, we believe, was originally spelt  Bourke.    The great grandfather of Edmund inherited some property in that county  which has produced so many men of talent--the county of Cork; the family  resided in the neighborhood of Castletown Roche, four or five miles from  Doneraile, five or six miles from Mallow--now a railroad station--and  nearly the same distance from the ruins of Kilcolman Castle, whose every  mouldering stone is hallowed by the memory of the poet Spenser and his  dear friend, \"the Shepherd of the Ocean,\" Sir Walter Raleigh. There can  be little doubt that Edmund--a portion of whose young life was passed in  this beautiful locality--imbibed much thought, as well as much poetry,  from the sacred memories which here accompanied him during his  wanderings.    Nothing so thoroughly awakens the sympathy of the young as the imaginary  presence of the good and great amid the scenes where their most glorious  works were accomplished; the associations connected with Kilcolman are  so mingled, that their contemplation produces a variety of  emotions--admiration for the poem which was created within its  walls--contemplation of the \"glorious two\" who there spent so much time  together in harmony and sweet companionship, despite the storms which  ravaged the country; then the awful catastrophe, the burning of the  castle, and the loss of Spenser's child in the flames, still talked of  in the neighborhood, were certain to make a deep impression on the  imagination of a boy whose delicate health prevented his rushing into  the amusements and society of children of his own age. There are plenty  of crones in every village, and one at least in every gentleman's house  to watch \"the master's children\" and pour legendary lore into their  willing ears, accompanied by snatches of song and fairy tale. All these  were certain to seize upon such an imagination as that of Burke, and lay  the foundation of much of that high-souled mental poetry--one of his  great characteristics; indeed, the circumstances of his youth were  highly favorable to his peculiar temperament--his delicate constitution  rendered him naturally susceptible of the beautiful; and the locality of  the Blackwater, and the time-honored ruins of Kilcolman, with its  history and traditions, nursed, as they were, by the holy quiet of a  country life, had ample time to sink into his soul and germinate the  fruitage which, in after years, attained such rich perfection.    An old schoolmaster, of the name of O'Halloran, was his first teacher;  he \"played at learning\" at the school, long since in ruins; and the  Dominie used to boast that \"no matter how great Master Edmund (God bless  him) was, HE was the first who ever put a Latin grammar into his hands.\"    Edmund was one of a numerous family; his mother, who had been a Miss  Nagle,[1] having had fourteen or fifteen children, all of whom died  young, except four,--one sister and three brothers: the sister, Mrs.  French, was brought up in the faith of her mother, who was a rigid Roman  Catholic, while the sons were trained in the father's belief. This,  happily, created no unkindness between them, for not only were they an  affectionate and a united family, but perfectly charitable in their  opinions, each of the other's creed. As the future statesman grew older,  it was considered wise to remove him to Dublin for better instruction,  and he was placed at a school in Smithfield kept by a Mr. James  Fitzgerald; but, fortunately for his strength of body and mind, the  reputation of an academy in the lovely valley of Ballitore, founded in  the midst of a colony of Quakers, by a member of that most benevolent  and intelligent society--the well-known Abraham Shackleton--was  spreading far and wide; and there the three young Burkes were sent in  1741, Edmund being then twelve years old.    He was considered not so much brilliant, as of steady application. Here,  too, he was remarkable for quick comprehension, and great strength "]]]
