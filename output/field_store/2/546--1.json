It was published in France the next  year. Although published under the name of Jules Verne, it is now  believed to be chiefly if not entirely the work of Jules' son, Michel  Verne. In any event, many of the topics in the article echo Verne's  ideas.]        IN THE YEAR 2889.    Little though they seem to think of it, the people of this twenty-ninth  century live continually in fairyland. Surfeited as they are with  marvels, they are indifferent in presence of each new marvel. To them  all seems natural. Could they but duly appreciate the refinements of  civilization in our day; could they but compare the present with the  past, and so better comprehend the advance we have made! How much fairer  they would find our modern towns, with populations amounting sometimes  to 10,000,000 souls; their streets 300 feet wide, their houses 1000 feet  in height; with a temperature the same in all seasons; with their lines  of aërial locomotion crossing the sky in every direction! If they would  but picture to themselves the state of things that once existed, when  through muddy streets rumbling boxes on wheels, drawn by horses--yes, by  horses!--were the only means of conveyance. Think of the railroads of  the olden time, and you will be able to appreciate the pneumatic tubes  through which to-day one travels at the rate of 1000 miles an hour.  Would not our contemporaries prize the telephone and the telephote more  highly if they had not forgotten the telegraph?    Singularly enough, all these transformations rest upon principles which  were perfectly familiar to our remote ancestors, but which they  disregarded. Heat, for instance, is as ancient as man himself;  electricity was known 3000 years ago, and steam 1100 years ago. Nay, so  early as ten centuries ago it was known that the differences between the  several chemical and physical forces depend on the mode of vibration of  the etheric particles, which is for each specifically different. When at  last the kinship of all these forces was discovered, it is simply  astounding that 500 years should still have to elapse before men could  analyze and describe the several modes of vibration that constitute  these differences. Above all, it is singular that the mode of  reproducing these forces directly from one another, and of reproducing  one without the others, should have remained undiscovered till less than  a hundred years ago. Nevertheless, such was the course of events, for it  was not till the year 2792 that the famous Oswald Nier made this great  discovery.    Truly was he a great benefactor of the human race. His admirable  discovery led to many another. Hence is sprung a pleiad of inventors,  its brightest star being our great Joseph Jackson. To Jackson we are  indebted for those wonderful instruments the new accumulators. Some of  these absorb and condense the living force contained in the sun's rays;  others, the electricity stored in our globe; others again, the energy  coming from whatever source, as a waterfall, a stream, the winds, etc.  He, too, it was that invented the transformer, a more wonderful  contrivance still, which takes the living force from the accumulator,  and, on the simple pressure of a button, gives it back to space in  whatever form may be desired, whether as heat, light, electricity, or  mechanical force, after having first obtained from it the work required.  From the day when these two instruments were contrived is to be dated  the era of true progress. They have put into the hands of man a power  that is almost infinite. As for their applications, they are numberless.  Mitigating the rigors of winter, by giving back to the atmosphere the  surplus heat stored up during the summer, they have revolutionized  agriculture. By supplying motive power for aërial navigation, they have  given to commerce a mighty impetus. To them we are indebted for the  continuous production of electricity without batteries or dynamos, of  light without combustion or incandescence, and for an unfailing supply  of mechanical energy for all the needs of industry.    Yes, all these wonders have been wrought by the accumulator and the  transformer. And can we not to them also trace, indirectly, this latest  wonder of all, the great \"Earth Chronicle\" building in 253d Avenue,  which was dedicated the other day? If George Washington Smith, the  founder of the Manhattan \"Chronicle,\" should come back to life to-day,  what would he think were he to be told that this palace of marble and  gold belongs to his remote descendant, Fritz Napoleon Smith, who, after  thirty generations have come and gone, is owner of the same newspaper  which his ancestor established!    For George Washington Smith's newspaper has lived generation after  generation, now passing out of the family, anon coming back to it. When,  200 years ago, the political center of the United States was transferred  from Washington to Centropolis, the newspaper followed the government  and assumed the name of Earth Chronicle. Unfortunately, it was unable to  maintain itself at the high level of its name. Pressed on all sides by  rival journals of a more modern type, it was continually in danger of  collapse. Twenty years ago its subscription list contained but a few  hundred thousand names, and then Mr. Fritz Napoleon Smith bought it for  a mere trifle, and originated telephonic journalism.    Every one is familiar with Fritz Napoleon Smith's system--a system made  possible by the enormous development of telephony during the last  hundred years. Instead of being printed, the Earth Chronicle is every  morning spoken to subscribers, who, in interesting conversations with  reporters, statesmen, and scientists, learn the news of the day.  Furthermore, each subscriber owns a phonograph, and to this instrument  he leaves the task of gathering the news whenever he happens not to be  in a mood to listen directly himself. As for purchasers of single  copies, they can at a very trifling cost learn all that is in the paper  of the day at any of the innumerable phonographs set up nearly  everywhere.    Fritz Napoleon Smith's innovation galvanized the old newspaper. In the  course of a few years the number of subscribers grew to be 85,000,000,  and Smith's wealth went on growing, till now it reaches the almost  unimaginable figure of $10,000,000,000. This lucky hit has enabled him  to erect his new building, a vast edifice with four _façades_, each 3,250  feet in length, over which proudly floats the hundred-starred flag of  the Union. Thanks to the same lucky hit, he is to-day king of  newspaperdom; indeed, he would be king of all the Americans, too, if  Americans could ever accept a king. You do not believe it? Well, then,  look at the plenipotentiaries of all nations and our own ministers  themselves crowding about his door, entreating his counsels, begging for  his approbation, imploring the aid of his all-powerful organ. Reckon up  the number of scientists and artists that he supports, of inventors that  he has under his pay.    Yes, a king is he. And in truth his is a royalty full of burdens. His  labors are incessant, and there is no doubt at all that in earlier times  any man would have succumbed under the overpowering stress of the toil  which Mr. Smith has to perform. Very fortunately for him, thanks to the  progress of hygiene, which, abating all the old sources of  unhealthfulness, has lifted the mean of human life from 37 up to 52  years, men have stronger constitutions now than heretofore. The  discovery of nutritive air is still in the future, but in the meantime  men today consume food that is compounded and prepared according to  scientific principles, and they breathe an atmosphere freed from the  micro-organisms that formerly used to swarm in it; hence they live  longer than their forefathers and know nothing of the innumerable  diseases of olden times.    Nevertheless, and notwithstanding these considerations, Fritz Napoleon  Smith's mode of life may well astonish one. His iron constitution is  taxed to the utmost by the heavy strain that is put upon it. Vain the  attempt to estimate the amount of labor he undergoes; an example alone  can give an idea of it. Let us then go about with him for one day as he  attends to his multifarious concernments. What day? That matters little;  it is the same every day. Let us then take at random September 25th of  this present year 2889.    This morning Mr. Fritz Napoleon Smith awoke in very bad humor. His wife  having left for France eight days ago, he was feeling disconsolate.  Incredible though it seems, in all the ten years since their marriage,  this is the first time that Mrs. Edith Smith, the professional beauty,  has been so long absent from home; two or three days usually suffice for  her frequent trips to Europe. The first thing that Mr. Smith does is to  connect his phonotelephote, the wires of which communicate with his  Paris mansion. The telephote! Here is another of the great triumphs of  science in our time. The transmission of speech is an old story; the  transmission of images by means of sensitive mirrors connected by wires  is a thing but of yesterday. A valuable invention indeed, and Mr. Smith  this morning was not niggard of blessings for the inventor, when by its  aid he was able distinctly to see his wife notwithstanding the distance  that separated him from her. Mrs. Smith, weary after the ball or the  visit to the theater the preceding night, is still abed, though it is  near noontide at Paris. She is asleep, her head sunk in the lace-covered  pillows. What? She stirs? Her lips move. She is dreaming perhaps? Yes,  dreaming. She is talking, pronouncing a name--his name--Fritz! The  delightful vision gave a happier turn to Mr. Smith's thoughts. And now,  at the call of imperative duty,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19364"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 05, May 1895 (#1)"],[1,"BROCHURE SERIES    OF ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSTRATION.      VOL. I. MAY, 1895. No. 5.    TWO FLORENTINE PAVEMENTS.      The church of San Miniato al Monte, just outside the walls southeast of  Florence, and the Baptistery, or church of San Giovanni Battista, in  Florence, are among the finest examples of the Tuscan Romanesque style,  and both probably date from about the same time--the early part of the  twelfth century--although the date of San Miniato has until recently  been referred several centuries further back.    These two churches have many points of similarity, although entirely  different in plan. San Miniato was referred to in the article upon the  Byzantine-Romanesque doorways of Southern Italy in our February number,  and Fergusson's classification of Byzantine-Romanesque was, for the time  being, adopted for lack of better authority. Later writers have,  however, generally agreed that there is little or no Byzantine influence  in these two churches; that the delicate and refined treatment of  classic forms here found is not the result of Byzantine or Greek  influence, but is due entirely to the natural refinement of the Tuscan  race. The same characteristic was again shown later in the treatment of  Gothic detail, and is evident in the Renaissance work of this locality.    The dimensions of San Miniato were given in the February number referred  to above. The interior of this church is generally considered one of the  most beautiful interiors of Italy on account of its effective basilican  plan with a crypt opening from the nave, its beautiful and rich detail,  and its fine mosaics and decorations. The pavement is not the least of  its attractions.    The Baptistery will be remembered for its famous bronze doors, the work  of Ghiberti, which have given occasion for so much discussion, favorable  and unfavorable. It is octagonal in plan, and 108 feet in diameter  externally. It was erected originally for the cathedral of the city, but  in the eleventh and twelfth centuries was so thoroughly remodeled that  no recognizable features of the old building remain.    The pavements, in point of design, appear quite independent of the other  ornamental work in the two buildings we are considering.    The motives of ornament are those commonly found in the stuffs,  especially silks, of Sicily and the East, and their use here could  easily be accounted for through connection with Sicily. It is known that  the Hotel de Tiraz at Palermo, the great royal manufactory of stuffs,  artistic metal work, mosaics, etc., established in the sixth century,  and which continued until the sixteenth, supplied not only much of the  finest textile products for all of Europe in that time, but also  furnished workmen who carried with them the designs and methods of  Sicilian textile manufacture to other countries. Such manufactories were  established in several Italian cities, among them Lucca.    The relationship seems clear, as the forms are perfectly similar. The  beasts and birds set in balancing pairs facing each other and repeated  in an all-over pattern, as in a woven fabric, strongly suggest the  Sicilian silks. Eug. Muentz in his work, \"La Tapisserie,\" speaks of this  evident relationship. The internal evidence of the design itself would  be quite sufficient if we had no other means of tracing it.    These two pavements are practically unique, as far as we are able to  learn. They are marble inlay, the pattern having been cut out in a slab  of white marble and pieces of black marble carefully fitted in to form  the figure. This is not true mosaic, and differs essentially in design  from the mosaic work of the same period which was derived from the Roman  mosaics made up of small pieces of marble or other material. Most of the  floor mosaics in Italy have suffered from wear and tear, and have in  many cases been very poorly restored; but these two pavements appear to  be in nearly their original condition.    The design does not have the merit of belonging distinctively to the  material in all cases, and might just as well be applied to wood  parquetry as stone. In fact, it might be even more effective in this  material if the colors were judiciously chosen.          [Illustration: XXXIII.

One exception should be made to the remarks above in relation to true  mosaic. The lower left-hand portion of plate XXXVI is without doubt made  up of small pieces put together after the manner of the old Roman  mosaics, and it is possible that the portion shown in the upper  left-hand corner of the same plate is made in the same way. There are  several parts of the floor laid in this manner, but they are distinctly  secondary in interest to the inlaid portions.    The pavement is divided irregularly by squares and rectangles, the  portion especially rich in ornament being that between the door and the  altar. The rectangular patterns are irregularly cut into by special  pavements, placed before several of the monumental tombs in the walls.          [Illustration: XXXVIII. Portion of the Pavement in the Church of San  Miniato al Monte, Florence, Italy.]    [Illustration: XXXIX.

Portion of the Pavement in the Church of San Miniato  al Monte, Florence, Italy.]      XXXVIII to XL.    PORTIONS OF THE PAVEMENT IN THE CHURCH OF SAN MINIATO AL MONTE,  FLORENCE, ITALY.    In the first of these plates there is a suggestion of the mosaic  treatment commonly seen in the pavements of Rome, Venice, and Siena.  The sort of guilloche of interlacing circles was very generally used.    Plate XL on the other hand is as plainly reminiscent of textile designs  as it well might be; and in plate XXXIII from the Baptistery the same  characteristic can be seen.          Wood Floors.      The addition which a fine hardwood floor makes to the attractiveness of  a room is appreciated by some architects, but good floors are not by any  means as common as they should be. The expense of hard wood is not so  much more than that of a cheap floor as to stand in the way of its use  when the final result is considered.    It is generally admitted that a floor entirely covered with a carpet is  in many ways undesirable, especially from a sanitary point of view;  while a hardwood floor, wholly or partly covered with rugs, has every  advantage. Furthermore, the fashion, which has a great deal to do with  what shall be used, aside from any question of intrinsic merit, has set  strongly in this direction, and in many cases old floors are replaced  with new ones of hard wood for the sole purpose of giving a chance for  the use of rugs in place of carpets. This is one, even if it be a rare  instance of the agreement of fashion and good taste. In working over an  old floor a plain or ornamental border can usually be laid at no great  expense by using the thin wood carpet, manufactured by all the best  makers of parquetry, and the centre can be laid with a pattern or with  narrow strips such as the \"roll goods\" which are manufactured by S. C.  Johnson of Racine, which are made up of strips usually one and  three-eighths inches wide and five sixteenths of an inch thick, glued to  a backing of canvas.    Patterns of all descriptions made from all the best foreign and domestic  woods can be obtained, as the designs of the best manufacturers include  an almost unlimited choice, and there is no end to the combinations  which can be made from the stock patterns. As an instance of this, the  catalogue of J. W. Boughton of Philadelphia contains a remarkably fine  selection of borders which can be combined and adapted to almost any  requirement, while the designs for the field or centre of the floor are  fully as varied and usable. These designs are made in such shape that  they can be easily adapted to any shape of room and fitted to all sorts  of irregular niches and jogs at slight extra expense.    Owing to the economy of manufacturing floors made from pieces which can  be put together on a system of squares, hexagons, or octagons, most of  the patterns in common use are made up of these units, or of triangles  or rectangles combining to form these figures. Curved forms cannot be  used to good advantage in this way as it is difficult and expensive to  cut or join them properly. Nevertheless, all the principal manufacturers  will execute to order any design desired.    When placed in a new house floors of 7/8 inch or 1-1/4 inch are usually  to be preferred, and are made in sections of convenient size for  shipment at the factory, and finished after they are in place.    Most of the makers nail thin parquetry work through from the surface and  fill the nail holes with putty, although in some cases blind nailing is  used.    Western manufacturers have in the last few years been making rapid  progress in this industry. While J. W. Boughton, who is one of the  oldest and best known makers of ornamental flooring, is still doing a  large and increasing business, Western houses are catering to and  obtaining a great deal of the best trade. The Interior Hardwood Company  of Indianapolis, under the business management of its vice-president,  Mr. Charles Hinman Comstock, has doubled its capacity in the last year  and shows commendable energy in pushing its business. S. C. Johnson of  Racine, Wis., is also in the front rank in first-class trade. The  Wood-Mosaic Company of Rochester should also be"]]]
