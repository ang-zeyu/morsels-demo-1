This Nature is subjected to an absolute organization, to determined laws,  to a complete order and a finished design, from which it will never  depart--to such a degree, indeed, that if you look carefully and with keen  sight, from the smallest invisible atom up to such large bodies of the  world of existence as the globe of the sun or the other great stars and  luminous spheres, whether you regard their arrangement, their composition,  their form or their movement, you will find that all are in the highest  degree of organization and are under one law from which they will never  depart.    But when you look at Nature itself, you see that it has no intelligence,  no will. For instance, the nature of fire is to burn; it burns without  will or intelligence. The nature of water is fluidity; it flows without  will or intelligence. The nature of the sun is radiance; it shines without  will or intelligence. The nature of vapor is to ascend; it ascends without  will or intelligence. Thus it is clear that the natural movements of all  things are compelled; there are no voluntary movements except those of  animals and, above all, those of man. Man is able to resist and to oppose  Nature because he discovers the constitution of things, and through this  he commands the forces of Nature; all the inventions he has made are due  to his discovery of the constitution of things. For example, he invented  the telegraph, which is the means of communication between the East and  the West. It is evident, then, that man rules over Nature.    Now, when you behold in existence such organizations, arrangements and  laws, can you say that all these are the effect of Nature, though Nature  has neither intelligence nor perception? If not, it becomes evident that  this Nature, which has neither perception nor intelligence, is in the  grasp of Almighty God, Who is the Ruler of the world of Nature; whatever  He wishes, He causes Nature to manifest.    One of the things which has appeared in the world of existence, and which  is one of the requirements of Nature, is human life. Considered from this  point of view man is the branch; nature is the root. Then can the will and  the intelligence, and the perfections which exist in the branch, be absent  in the root?    It is said that Nature in its own essence is in the grasp of the power of  God, Who is the Eternal Almighty One: He holds Nature within accurate  regulations and laws, and rules over it.(1)          2: PROOFS AND EVIDENCES OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD      One of the proofs and demonstrations of the existence of God is the fact  that man did not create himself: nay, his creator and designer is another  than himself.    It is certain and indisputable that the creator of man is not like man  because a powerless creature cannot create another being. The maker, the  creator, has to possess all perfections in order that he may create.    Can the creation be perfect and the creator imperfect? Can a picture be a  masterpiece and the painter imperfect in his art? For it is his art and  his creation. Moreover, the picture cannot be like the painter; otherwise,  the painting would have created itself. However perfect the picture may  be, in comparison with the painter it is in the utmost degree of  imperfection.    The contingent world is the source of imperfections: God is the origin of  perfections. The imperfections of the contingent world are in themselves a  proof of the perfections of God.    For example, when you look at man, you see that he is weak. This very  weakness of the creature is a proof of the power of the Eternal Almighty  One, because, if there were no power, weakness could not be imagined. Then  the weakness of the creature is a proof of the power of God; for if there  were no power, there could be no weakness; so from this weakness it  becomes evident that there is power in the world. Again, in the contingent  world there is poverty; then necessarily wealth exists, since poverty is  apparent in the world. In the contingent world there is ignorance;  necessarily knowledge exists, because ignorance is found; for if there  were no knowledge, neither would there be ignorance. Ignorance is the  nonexistence of knowledge, and if there were no existence, nonexistence  could not be"]]]
