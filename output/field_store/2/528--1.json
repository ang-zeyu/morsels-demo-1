Bills passed in this Session of Parliament._          STATE OF THE NATION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REVOLUTION.    {1689}    The constitution of England had now assumed a new aspect. The maxim  of hereditary indefeisible right was at length renounced by a free  parliament. The power of the crown was acknowledged to flow from no  other fountain than that of a contract with the people. Allegiance and  protection were declared reciprocal ties depending upon each other. The  representatives of the nation made a regular claim of rights in  behalf of their constituents; and William III. ascended the throne in  consequence of an express capitulation with the people. Yet, on this  occasion, the zeal of the parliament towards their deliverer seems to  have overshot their attachment to their own liberty and privileges: or  at least they neglected the fairest opportunity that ever occurred, to  retrench those prerogatives of the crown to which they imputed all the  late and former calamities of the kingdom. Their new monarch retained  the old regal power over parliaments in its full extent. He was left  at liberty to convoke, adjourn, prorogue, and dissolve them at  his pleasure. He was enabled to influence elections, and oppress  corporations. He possessed the right of choosing his own council; of  nominating all the great officers of the state, and of the household, of  the army, the navy, and the church. He reserved the absolute command  of the militia: so that lie remained master of all the instruments and  engines of corruption and violence, without any other restraint than his  own moderation, and prudent regard to the claim of rights, and principle  of resistance on which the revolution was founded. In a word, the  settlement was finished with some precipitation, before the plan had  been properly digested and matured; and this will be the case in every  establishment formed upon a sudden emergency in the face of opposition.  It was observed, that the king, who was made by the people, had it in  his power to rule without them; to govern _jure divino_ though he was  created _jure humano_: and that, though the change proceeded from a  republican spirit, the settlement was built upon tory maxims; for  the execution of his government continued still independent of his  commission, while his own person remained sacred and inviolable. The  prince of Orange had been invited to England by a coalition of parties,  united by a common sense of danger; but this tie was no sooner broken  than they flew asunder and each resumed its original bias. Their mutual  jealousy and rancour revived, and was heated by dispute into intemperate  zeal and enthusiasm. Those who at first acted from principles of  patriotism were insensibly warmed into partizans; and king William  soon found himself at the head of a faction. As he had been bred, a  Calvinist, and always expressed an abhorrence of spiritual persecution,  the presbyter-ians, and other protestant dissenters, considered him as  their peculiar protector, and entered into his interests with the most  zealous fervour and assiduity. For the same reasons the friends of  the church became jealous of his proceedings, and employed all their  influence, first in opposing his elevation to the throne, and afterwards  in thwarting his measures. Their party was espoused by all the friends  of the lineal succession; by the Roman catholics; by those who were  personally attached to the late king; and by such as were disgusted  by the conduct and personal deportment of William since his arrival  in England. They observed, That, contrary to his declaration, he  had plainly aspired to the crown; and treated his father-in-law with  insolence and rigour; that his army contained a number of foreign  papists, almost equal to that of the English Roman catholics whom James  had employed; that the reports so industriously circulated about the  birth of the prince of Wales, the treaty with France for enslaving  England, and the murder of the earl of Essex-reports countenanced by the  prince of Orange-now appeared to be without foundation; that the Dutch  troops remained in London, while the English forces were distributed in  remote quarters; that the prince declared the first should be kept about  his person, and the latter sent to Ireland; that the two houses out of  complaisance to William, had denied their late sovereign the justice of  being heard in his own defence; and that the Dutch had lately interfered  with the trade of London, which was already sensibly diminished. These  were the sources of discontent, swelled up by the resentment of some  noblemen and other individuals, disappointed in their hopes of profit  and preferment.            ACCOUNT OF THE NEW MINISTRY.    William began his reign with a proclamation, for confirming all  protestants in the offices which they enjoyed on the first day of  December; then he chose the members of his council, who were generally  staunch to his interest, except the archbishop of Canterbury and the  earl of Nottingham, and these were admitted in complaisance to the  church-party, which it was not thought adviseable to provoke. [001]  _[See note A, at the end of this Vol.]_ Nottingham and Shrewsbury were  appointed secretaries of state; the privy-seal was bestowed upon the  marquis of Halifax; the earl of Danby was created president of  the council. These two noblemen enjoyed a good share of the king's  confidence, and Nottingham was considerable as head of the church-party:  but the chief favourite was Bentinck, first commoner on the list of  privy-counsellors, as well as groom of the stole and privy purse.  D'Averquerque was made master of the horse, Zuylestein of the robes, and  Sehomberg of the ordnance: the treasury, admiralty, and chancery were  put in commission; twelve able judges were chosen;* and the diocese of  Salisbury being vacated by the death of Dr. Ward, the king of his own  free motion filled it with Burnet, who had been a zealous stickler for  his interest; and in a particular manner instrumental in effecting the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19218"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.III.

Domestic       Occurrences    {1760}          ACCESSION OF GEORGE III.    Few monarchs ever ascended a throne under more auspicious circumstances  than George III. The sources of national wealth and prosperity  were daily becoming developed, and the British arms were everywhere  victorious. So extensive were their conquests, indeed, that it may  be said, the sun rose and set, at this date, within the limits of the  British dominions.    Prince George, who was the eldest son of the late Frederick, Prince of  Wales, was riding on horseback in the neighbourhood of Kew palace, with  his groom of the stole, Lord Bute, when news was brought him that his  grandfather was dead. This intelligence was confirmed soon after by  the arrival of Mr. Pitt, the head of the government, and they repaired  together to Kew. On the next morning George went up to St. James's,  where Pitt waited upon him, and presented the sketch of an address to  be pronounced at the meeting of the privy council. Pitt, however, was  doomed to find a rival where he thought to have found a friend. He was  told by his majesty, that an address had already been prepared, which  convinced him that Bute, on whose favour he had reckoned, would not  be contented with a subordinate place in the new government, but would  aspire to the highest offices in the state. In the course of the day,  October 26th, George was proclaimed king with the usual solemnities.    The accession of George, notwithstanding, did not involve any immediate  change in the existing administration. The Earl of Bute, together with  Prince Edward, Duke of York, were admitted into the privy council, but  it was given out that his majesty was satisfied, and even charmed,  with the existing cabinet, and that he would make no changes, with the  exception of a few in the household and in the minor offices. One of the  first acts of George III., was a proclamation \"for the encouragement of  piety and virtue, and for preventing and punishing of vice, profaneness,  and immorality.\" This was naturally looked upon as a token of his  majesty's virtue and devotion, which view was borne out by his after  character; for although the proclamation may be considered in the  light of a dead letter as regards actual operation, it was enforced,  or recommended, by his example; and example hath a louder tongue either  than precept, proclamations, or laws. From the beginning to the close  of his long reign, George III. manifested a decent, moral, and religious  life, which doubtless had very beneficial effects upon society at large.    On the accession of the new king, parliament was prorogued, first to  the thirteenth, and afterwards to the eighteenth, of November. In the  meantime, public attention was engaged by the equipment of a large  squadron of men-of-war and transports at Portsmouth, and speculations  were rife as to the policy of the monarch--whether it would be  favourable to war or to peace. All classes of society, however, agreed  in anticipating the happiest results from his rule, since he had been  born and bred among them, and was well acquainted with the language,  manners, laws, and institutions of the people over whom he presided.  Loyal and dutiful addresses, expressing such sentiments, were presented  to the young monarch by the city of London, the two universities, and  from various bodies of people, to all which he returned sententious but  suitable replies, declaring his fixed resolve to respect their rights  and conciliate their esteem. A letter was addressed to him by the  venerable Bishop of London, Dr. Sherlock, as a parting benediction, in  which he gave him the following wise council:--\"You, sir,\" he writes,  \"are the person whom the people ardently desire; which affection of  theirs is happily returned by your majesty's declared concern for their  prosperity: and let nothing disturb this mutual consent; let there be  but one contest, whether the king loves the people best, or the people  him; and may it be a long, a very long, contest; may it never be  decided, but let it remain doubtful; and may the paternal affection on  the one side, and the filial obedience on the other, he had in perpetual  remembrance.\"          MEETING OF PARLIAMENT ETC.    The new king met parliament for the first time on the eighteenth of  November. He opened the session with a speech, announcing not only the  state of public and domestic affairs, but also the general principles by  which he intended to rule. One clause in his speech was very gratifying  to the people: \"Born and educated in this country,\" he observed, \"I  glory in the name of Briton.\" Having uttered this memorable sentence, he  said it would be the happiness of his life to promote the happiness and  interests of his loyal and affectionate people; and that their civil  and religious rights were equally as dear to him as the valuable  prerogatives of his crown. He then declared, that on his accession to  the throne of his ancestors he found the kingdom in a flourishing and  glorious state; victorious and happy; although engaged in a necessary  war, which, in the language of the late reign, he designated, \"a war for  the Protestant interest.\" In this speech he neither spoke of peace nor  negociation, but asked the assistance of parliament to prosecute this  war with vigour. Finally, addressing the Commons on the subject of  supplies, he concluded his speech thus:--\"The eyes of all Europe are on  you; from your resolutions the Protestant interest hopes for protection,  as well as all our friends for the preservation of their independency;  and our enemies fear the final disappointment of their ambitious and  destructive views: let these hopes and fears be confirmed and augmented,  by the vigour, unanimity, and despatch of our proceedings. In this  expectation I am the more encouraged, by a pleasing circumstance, which  I consider one of the most auspicious omens of my reign--that happy  extinction of divisions, and that union and good harmony, which continue  to prevail amongst my subjects, afford me the most agreeable prospects;  the natural disposition and wish of my heart are to cement and promote  them; and I promise myself, that nothing will arise on your part to  interrupt or disturb a situation so essential to the true and lasting  felicity of this great people.\" This speech was warmly responded to  by addresses from both houses of parliament; and the supplies for the  ensuing year, amounting to L19,616,119, were cheerfully voted, while the  civil list was fixed at L809,000; the king, on his part, consenting to  such a disposition of the hereditary revenues of the crown, as might  best promote the interests of the nation.    War, therefore, was to be continued, and Mr. Pitt and his colleagues  seemed to be confirmed in office: yet at this very moment the train was  laying for their expulsion. Earl Bute was anxious to become secretary  of state, and he was busily engaged in a correspondence with the noted  intriguer, Bubb Doddington. A few days after the meeting of parliament  his lordship declared to Doddington, that Lord Holderness \"was ready at  his desire to quarrel with his fellow ministers, and go to the king and  throw up with seeming-anger, and then he (Bute) might come in without  seeming to displace anybody.\" This expedient, however, did not please  Doddington, and Bute paid deference to his opinion. Still the two  friends took counsel together on this important affair. In a letter  from Doddington to Bute, which was written in December, he advises \"that  nothing be done that can be justly imputed to precipitation; nothing  delayed that can be imputed to fear.\" He adds: \"Remember, my noble and  generous friend, that to recover monarchy from the inveterate usurpation  of oligarchy, is a point too arduous and important to be achieved  without much difficulty, and some degree of danger; though none but what  attentive moderation and unalterable firmness will certainly surmount.\"    In his career of ambition, Bute, who was \"better fitted to perform  Lothario on the stage,\" than to act as"]]]
