PREYER  PROFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY IN JENA    TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GERMAN  BY H. W. BROWN  TEACHER IN THE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL AT WORCESTER, MASS.    NEW YORK  D. APPLETON AND COMPANY  1895          COPYRIGHT, 1889,  BY D. APPLETON AND COMPANY.          EDITOR'S PREFACE.    This second volume contains the further investigations of Professor  Preyer on the mind of the child. The former volume contained the first  and second portions, devoted respectively to the development of the  senses and of the will. The present volume contains the third part,  treating of the development of the intellect; and three appendixes are  added containing supplementary matter.    Professor Preyer considers that the development of the power of using  language is the most prominent index to the unfolding of the intellect.  He differs with Professor Max Mueller, however, on the question whether  the operation of thinking can be carried on without the use of words  (see the recent elaborate work of the latter on \"The Science of  Thought\").    At my suggestion, the painstaking translator of this book has prepared  a full conspectus, showing the results of Professor Preyer's careful  observations in a chronological order, arranged by months. This  considerable labor will render the book more practical, inasmuch as it  will enable each reader to see at a glance the items of development of  the child in the several departments brought together in epochs. This  makes it possible to institute comparative observations under the  guidance of Professor Preyer's method. I think that I do not exaggerate  the value of this conspectus when I say that it doubles the value of the  work to the reader.    WILLIAM T. HARRIS.  CONCORD, MASS., _November, 1888_.

LONDON: PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,  STAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS.          THIS POPULAR HISTORY OF OUR INDIAN MAMMALS IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED  (BY PERMISSION) TO ONE WHO TAKES A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL THAT CONCERNS  OUR EASTERN EMPIRE, THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF NORTHBROOK, G.C.S.I.,  LATE GOVERNOR-GENERAL AND VICEROY OF INDIA.          PREFACE.      This work is designed to meet an existing want, viz.: a popular manual  of Indian Mammalia. At present the only work of the kind is one which  treats exclusively of the Peninsula of India, and which consequently  omits the more interesting types found in Assam, Burmah, and Ceylon,  as well as the countries bordering the British Indian Empire on the  North. The geographical limits of the present work have been extended  to all territories likely to be reached by the sportsman from India,  thus greatly enlarging the field of its usefulness.    The stiff formality of the compiled \"Natural Histories\" has been  discarded, and the Author has endeavoured to present, in interesting  conversational and often anecdotal style, the results of experience  by himself and his personal friends; at the same time freely availing  himself of all the known authorities upon the subject.
