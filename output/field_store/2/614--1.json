Out in Piccadilly its heartening warmth seemed to infuse  into traffic and pedestrians alike a novel jauntiness, so that  bus drivers jested and even the lips of chauffeurs uncurled into  not unkindly smiles. Policemen whistled at their posts--clerks,  on their way to work; beggars approached the task of trying to  persuade perfect strangers to bear the burden of their  maintenance with that optimistic vim which makes all the  difference. It was one of those happy mornings.    At nine o'clock precisely the door of Number Seven Arundell  Street, Leicester Square, opened and a young man stepped out.    Of all the spots in London which may fairly be described as  backwaters there is none that answers so completely to the  description as Arundell Street, Leicester Square. Passing along  the north sidewalk of the square, just where it joins Piccadilly,  you hardly notice the bottleneck opening of the tiny cul-de-sac.  Day and night the human flood roars past, ignoring it. Arundell  Street is less than forty yards in length; and, though there are  two hotels in it, they are not fashionable hotels. It is just a  backwater.    In shape Arundell Street is exactly like one of those flat stone  jars in which Italian wine of the cheaper sort is stored. The  narrow neck that leads off Leicester Square opens abruptly into a  small court. Hotels occupy two sides of this; the third is at  present given up to rooming houses for the impecunious. These are  always just going to be pulled down in the name of progress to  make room for another hotel, but they never do meet with that  fate; and as they stand now so will they in all probability stand  for generations to come.    They provide single rooms of moderate size, the bed modestly  hidden during the day behind a battered screen. The rooms contain  a table, an easy-chair, a hard chair, a bureau, and a round tin  bath, which, like the bed, goes into hiding after its useful work  is performed. And you may rent one of these rooms, with breakfast  thrown in, for five dollars a week.    Ashe Marson had done so. He had rented the second-floor front of  Number Seven.    Twenty-six years before this story opens there had been born to  Joseph Marson, minister, and Sarah his wife, of Hayling,  Massachusetts, in the United States of America, a son. This son,  christened Ashe after a wealthy uncle who subsequently  double-crossed them by leaving his money to charities, in due  course proceeded to Harvard to study for the ministry. So far as  can be ascertained from contemporary records, he did not study a  great deal for the ministry; but he did succeed in running the  mile in four minutes and a half and the half mile at a  correspondingly rapid speed, and his researches in the art of  long jumping won him the respect of all.    That he should be awarded, at the conclusion of his Harvard  career, one of those scholarships at Oxford University instituted  by the late Cecil Rhodes for the encouragement of the liberal  arts, was a natural sequence of events.    That was how Ashe came to be in England.    The rest of Ashe's history follows almost automatically. He won  his blue for athletics at Oxford, and gladdened thousands by  winning the mile and the half mile two years in succession  against Cambridge at Queen's Club. But owing to the pressure of  other engagements he unfortunately omitted to do any studying,  and when the hour of parting arrived he was peculiarly unfitted  for any of the learned professions. Having, however, managed to  obtain a sort of degree, enough to enable him to call himself a  Bachelor of Arts, and realizing that you can fool some of the  people some of the time, he applied for and secured a series of  private tutorships.    A private tutor is a sort of blend of poor relation and  nursemaid, and few of the stately homes of England are without  one. He is supposed to instill learning and deportment into the  small son of the house; but what he is really there for is to  prevent the latter from being a nuisance to his parents when he  is home from school on his vacation.    Having saved a little money at this dreadful trade, Ashe came to  London and tried newspaper work. After two years of moderate  success he got in touch with the Mammoth Publishing Company.    The Mammoth Publishing Company, which controls several important  newspapers, a few weekly journals, and a number of other things,  does not disdain the pennies of the office boy and the junior  clerk. One of its many profitable ventures is a series of  paper-covered tales of crime and adventure. It was here that Ashe  found his niche. Those adventures of Gridley Quayle,  Investigator, which are so popular with a certain section of the  reading public, were his work.    Until the advent of Ashe and Mr. Quayle, the British Pluck  Library had been written by many hands and had included the  adventures of many heroes: but in Gridley Quayle the proprietors  held that the ideal had been reached, and Ashe received a  commission to conduct the entire British Pluck  Library--monthly--himself. On the meager salary paid him for  these labors he had been supporting himself ever since.    That was how Ashe came to be in Arundell Street, Leicester Square,  on this May morning.    He was a tall, well-built, fit-looking young man, with a clear  eye and a strong chin; and he was dressed, as he closed the front  door behind him, in a sweater, flannel trousers, and rubber-soled  gymnasium shoes. In one hand he bore a pair of Indian clubs, in  the other a skipping rope.    Having drawn in and expelled the morning air in a measured and  solemn fashion, which the initiated observer would have  recognized as that scientific deep breathing so popular nowadays,  he laid down his clubs, adjusted his rope and began to skip.    When he had taken the second-floor front of Number Seven, three  months before, Ashe Marson had realized that he must forego those  morning exercises which had become a second nature to him, or  else defy London's unwritten law and brave London's mockery. He  had not hesitated long. Physical fitness was his gospel. On the  subject of exercise he was confessedly a crank. He decided to  defy London.    The first time he appeared in Arundell Street in his sweater and  flannels he had barely whirled his Indian clubs once around his  head before he had attracted the following audience:      a) Two cabmen--one intoxicated;    b) Four waiters from the Hotel Mathis;    c) Six waiters from the Hotel Previtali;    d) Six chambermaids from the Hotel Mathis;    e) Five chambermaids from the Hotel Previtali;    f) The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis;    g) The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali;    h) A street cleaner;    i) Eleven nondescript loafers;    j) Twenty-seven children;    k) A cat.    They all laughed--even the cat--and kept on laughing. The  intoxicated cabman called Ashe \"Sunny Jim.\" And Ashe kept on  swinging his clubs.    A month later, such is the magic of perseverance, his audience  had narrowed down to the twenty-seven children. They still  laughed, but without that ringing conviction which the  sympathetic support of their elders had lent them.    And now, after three months, the neighborhood, having accepted  Ashe and his morning exercises as a natural phenomenon, paid him  no further attention.    On this particular morning Ashe Marson skipped with even more  than his usual vigor. This was because he wished to expel by  means of physical fatigue a small devil of discontent, of whose  presence within him he had been aware ever since getting out of  bed. It is in the Spring that the ache for the larger life comes  on us, and this was a particularly mellow Spring morning. It was  the sort of morning when the air gives us a feeling of  anticipation--a feeling that, on a day like this, things surely  cannot go jogging along in the same dull old groove; a  premonition that something romantic and exciting is about to  happen to us.    But the southwest wind of Spring brings also remorse. We catch  the vague spirit of unrest in the air and we regret our misspent  youth.    Ashe was doing this. Even as he skipped, he was conscious of a  wish that he had studied harder at college and was now in a  position to be doing something better than hack work for a  soulless publishing company. Never before had he been so  completely certain that he was sick to death of the rut into  which he had fallen.    Skipping brought no balm. He threw down his rope and took up the  Indian clubs. Indian clubs left him still unsatisfied. The  thought came to him that it was a long time since he had done his  Larsen Exercises. Perhaps they would heal him.    The Larsen Exercises, invented by a certain Lieutenant Larsen, of  the Swedish Army, have almost every sort of merit. They make a  man strong, supple, and slender. But they are not dignified.  Indeed, to one seeing them suddenly and without warning for the  first time, they are markedly humorous. The only reason why King  Henry, of England, whose son sank with the White Ship, never  smiled again, was because Lieutenant Larsen had not then invented  his admirable exercises.    So complacent, so insolently unselfconscious had Ashe become in  the course of three months, owing to his success in inducing the  populace to look on anything he did with the indulgent eye of  understanding, that it simply did not occur to him, when he  abruptly twisted his body into the shape of a corkscrew, in  accordance with the directions in the lieutenant's book for the  consummation of Exercise One, that he was doing anything funny.    And the behavior of those present seemed to justify his  confidence. The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis regarded him  without a smile. The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali might have  been in a trance, for all the interest he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive/Canadian Libraries)                    FORM AND FUNCTION    A CONTRIBUTION TO THE  HISTORY OF ANIMAL MORPHOLOGY    By E.S.

ILLUSTRATED    LONDON    JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET, W.    1916    _All rights reserved_    +---------------------------------------+  | Transcriber's Note: Obvious printer   |  | errors have been corrected, all other |  | inconsistencies in spelling and       |  | punctuation are as in the original.   |  +---------------------------------------+      PREFACE      This book is not intended to be a full or detailed history of animal  morphology: a complete account is given neither of morphological  discoveries nor of morphological theories. My aim has been rather to  call attention to the existence of diverse typical attitudes to the  problems of form, and to trace the interplay of the theories that have  arisen out of them.    The main currents of morphological thought are to my mind three--the  functional or synthetic, the formal or transcendental, and the  materialistic or disintegrative.    The first is associated with the great names of Aristotle, Cuvier, and  von Baer, and leads easily to the more open vitalism of Lamarck and  Samuel Butler. The typical representative of the second attitude is E.  Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and this habit of thought has greatly influenced  the development of evolutionary morphology.    The main battle-ground of these two opposing tendencies is the problem  of the relation of function to form. Is function the mechanical result  of form, or is form merely the manifestation of function or activity?  What is the essence of life--organisation or activity?    The materialistic attitude is not distinctively biological, but is  common to practically all fields of thought. It dates back to the  Greek atomists, and the triumph of mechanical science in the 19th  century has induced many to accept materialism as the only possible  scientific method. In biology it is more akin to the formal than to  the functional attitude.    In the course of this book I have not hidden my own sympathy with the  functional attitude. It appears to me probable that more insight will  be gained into the real nature of life and organisation by  concentrating on the active response of the animal, as manifested both  in behaviour and in morphogenesis, particularly in the post-embryonic  stages, than by giving attention exclusively to the historical aspect  of structure, as is the custom of \"pure morphology.\" I believe we  shall only make progress in this direction if we frankly adopt the  simple everyday conception of living things--which many of us have had  drilled out of us--that they are active, purposeful agents, not mere  complicated aggregations of protein and other substances. Such an  attitude is probably quite as sound philosophically as the opposing  one, but I have not in this place attempted any justification of it. I  have touched very lightly upon the controversy between vitalism and  materialism which has been revived with the early years of the present  century. It hardly lends itself as yet to historical treatment, and I  could hardly hope to maintain with regard to it that objective  attitude which should characterise the historian.    The main result I hope to have achieved with this book is the  demonstration, tentative and incomplete as it is, of the essential  continuity of animal morphology from the days of Aristotle down to our  own time. It is unfortunately true that modern biology, perhaps in  consequence of the great advances it has made in certain directions,  has to a considerable extent lost its historical consciousness, and if  this book helps in any degree to counteract this tendency so far as  animal morphology is concerned, it will have served its purpose.

His  interests appear to have been rather physiological than anatomical. He  traced the chief nerves of sense to the brain, which he considered to  be the seat of the soul, and he made some good guesses at the  mechanism of the organs of special sense. He showed that, contrary to  the received opinion, the seminal fluid did not originate in the  spinal cord. Two comparisons are recorded of his, one that puberty is  the equivalent of the flowering time in plants, the other that milk is  the equivalent of white of egg.[1] Both show his bias towards looking  at the functional side of living things. The latter comparison  reappears in Aristotle.    A century later Diogenes of Apollonia gave a description of the venous  system. He too placed the seat of sensation in the brain. He assumed a  vital air in all living things, being in this influenced by Anaximenes  whose primitive matter was infinite air. In following out this thought  he tried to prove that both fishes and oysters have the power of  breathing.[2]    A more strictly morphological note is struck by a curious saying of  Empedocles (4th century B.C.), that \"hair and foliage and the thick  plumage of birds are one.\"[3]    In the collected writings of Hippocrates and his school, the _Corpus  Hippocraticum_, of which no part is later than the end of the 5th  century, there are recorded many anatomical facts. The author of the  treatise \"On the Muscles\" knew, for instance, that the spinal marrow  is different from ordinary marrow and has membranes continuous with  those of the brain. Embryos of seven days (!) have all the parts of  the body plainly visible. Work on comparative embryology is contained  in the treatise \"On the Development of the Child.\"[4]    The author of the treatise \"On the Joints,\" which Littre calls \"the  great surgical monument of antiquity,\" is to be credited with the  first systematic attempt at comparative anatomy, for he compared the  human skeleton with that of other Vertebrates.    Aristotle (384-322 B.C.)[5] may fairly be said to be the founder of  comparative anatomy, not because he was specially interested in  problems of \"pure morphology,\" but because he described the structure  of many animals and classified them in a scientific way. We shall  discuss here the morphological ideas which occur in his writings upon  animals--in the _Historia Animialium_, the _De Partibus Animalium_,  and the _De Generatione Animalium_.    The _Historia Animalium_ is a most comprehensive work, in some ways  the finest text-book of Zoology ever written. Certainly few modern  text-books take such a broad and sane view of living creatures.  Aristotle never forgets that form and structure are but one of the  many properties of living things; he takes quite as much interest in  their behaviour, their ecology, distribution, comparative physiology.  He takes a special interest in"]]]
