Caldecott, and  engraver, James D. Cooper, planned to illustrate Washington Irving's  \"Old Christmas\" in this manner. Their primary idea was to carry out the  principle of the Sketch Book, by incorporating the designs with the  text. Throughout they have worked together and _con amore_. With what  success the public must decide.              NOVEMBER 1875.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#1)"],[1,"by    ZANE GREY          CHAPTER I    For some reason the desert scene before Lucy Bostil awoke varying  emotions--a sweet gratitude for the fullness of her life there at the  Ford, yet a haunting remorse that she could not be wholly content--a  vague loneliness of soul--a thrill and a fear for the strangely calling  future, glorious, unknown.    She longed for something to happen. It might be terrible, so long as it  was wonderful. This day, when Lucy had stolen away on a forbidden  horse, she was eighteen years old. The thought of her mother, who had  died long ago on their way into this wilderness, was the one drop of  sadness in her joy. Lucy loved everybody at Bostil's Ford and everybody  loved her. She loved all the horses except her father's favorite racer,  that perverse devil of a horse, the great Sage King.    Lucy was glowing and rapt with love for all she beheld from her lofty  perch: the green-and-pink blossoming hamlet beneath her, set between  the beauty of the gray sage expanse and the ghastliness of the barren  heights; the swift Colorado sullenly thundering below in the abyss; the  Indians in their bright colors, riding up the river trail; the eagle  poised like a feather on the air, and a beneath him the grazing cattle  making black dots on the sage; the deep velvet azure of the sky; the  golden lights on the bare peaks and the lilac veils in the far ravines;  the silky rustle of a canyon swallow as he shot downward in the sweep  of the wind; the fragrance of cedar, the flowers of the spear-pointed  mescal; the brooding silence, the beckoning range, the purple distance.    Whatever it was Lucy longed for, whatever was whispered by the wind and  written in the mystery of the waste of sage and stone, she wanted it to  happen there at Bostil's Ford. She had no desire for civilization, she  flouted the idea of marrying the rich rancher of Durango. Bostil's  sister, that stern but lovable woman who had brought her up and taught  her, would never persuade her to marry against her will. Lucy imagined  herself like a wild horse--free, proud, untamed, meant for the desert;  and here she would live her life. The desert and her life seemed as  one, yet in what did they resemble each other--in what of this scene  could she read the nature of her future?    Shudderingly she rejected the red, sullen, thundering river, with its  swift, changeful, endless, contending strife--for that was tragic. And  she rejected the frowning mass of red rock, upreared, riven and split  and canyoned, so grim and aloof--for that was barren. But she accepted  the vast sloping valley of sage, rolling gray and soft and beautiful,  down to the dim mountains and purple ramparts of the horizon. Lucy did  not know what she yearned for, she did not know why the desert called  to her, she did not know in what it resembled her spirit, but she did  know that these three feelings were as one, deep in her heart. For ten  years, every day of her life, she had watched this desert scene, and  never had there been an hour that it was not different, yet the same.  Ten years--and she grew up watching, feeling--till from the desert's  thousand moods she assimilated its nature, loved her bonds, and could  never have been happy away from the open, the color, the freedom, the  wildness. On this birthday, when those who loved her said she had  become her own mistress, she acknowledged the claim of the desert  forever. And she experienced a deep, rich, strange happiness.    Hers always then the mutable and immutable desert, the leagues and  leagues of slope and sage and rolling ridge, the great canyons and the  giant cliffs, the dark river with its mystic thunder of waters, the  pine-fringed plateaus, the endless stretch of horizon, with its lofty,  isolated, noble monuments, and the bold ramparts with their beckoning  beyond! Hers always the desert seasons: the shrill, icy blast, the  intense cold, the steely skies, the fading snows; the gray old sage and  the bleached grass under the pall of the spring sand-storms; the hot  furnace breath of summer, with its magnificent cloud pageants in the  sky, with the black tempests hanging here and there over the peaks,  dark veils floating down and rainbows everywhere, and the lacy  waterfalls upon the glistening cliffs and the thunder of the red  floods; and the glorious golden autumn when it was always afternoon and  time stood still! Hers always the rides in the open, with the sun at  her back and the wind in her face! And hers surely, sooner or later,  the nameless adventure which had its inception in the strange yearning  of her heart and presaged its fulfilment somewhere down that trailless  sage-slope she loved so well!    Bostil's house was a crude but picturesque structure of red stone and  white clay and bleached cottonwoods, and it stood at the outskirts of  the cluster of green-inclosed cabins which composed the hamlet. Bostil  was wont to say that in all the world there could hardly be a grander  view than the outlook down that gray sea of rolling sage, down to the  black-fringed plateaus and the wild, blue-rimmed and gold-spired  horizon.    One morning in early spring, as was Bostil's custom, he ordered the  racers to be brought from the corrals and turned loose on the slope. He  loved to sit there and watch his horses graze, but ever he saw that the  riders were close at hand, and that the horses did not get out on the  slope of sage. He sat back and gloried in the sight. He owned bands of  mustangs; near by was a field of them, fine and mettlesome and racy;  yet Bostil had eyes only for the blooded favorites. Strange it was that  not one of these was a mustang or a broken wild horse, for many of the  riders' best mounts had been captured by them or the Indians. And it  was Bostil's supreme ambition to own a great wild stallion. There was  Plume, a superb mare that got her name from the way her mane swept in  the wind when she was on the ran; and there was Two Face, like a  coquette, sleek and glossy and running and the huge, rangy bay, Dusty  Ben; and the black stallion Sarchedon; and lastly Sage King, the color  of the upland sage, a racer in build, a horse splendid and proud and  beautiful.    \"Where's Lucy?\" presently asked Bostil.    As he divided his love, so he divided his anxiety.    Some rider had seen Lucy riding off, with her golden hair flying in the  wind. This was an old story.    \"She's up on Buckles?\" Bostil queried, turning sharply to the speaker.    \"Reckon so,\" was the calm reply.    Bostil swore. He did not have a rider who could equal him in profanity.    \"Farlane, you'd orders. Lucy's not to ride them hosses, least of all  Buckles. He ain't safe even for a man.\"    \"Wal, he's safe fer Lucy.\"    \"But didn't I say no?\"    \"Boss, it's likely you did, fer you talk a lot,\" replied Farlane. \"Lucy  pulled my hat down over my eyes--told me to go to thunder--an' then,  zip! she an' Buckles were dustin' it fer the sage.\"    \"She's got to keep out of the sage,\" growled Bostil. \"It ain't safe for  her out there.... Where's my glass? I want to take a look at the slope.  Where's my glass?\"    The glass could not be found.    \"What's makin' them dust-clouds on the sage? Antelope? ... Holley, you  used to have eyes better 'n me. Use them, will you?\"    A gray-haired, hawk-eyed rider, lean and worn, approached with clinking  spurs.    \"Down in there,\" said Bostil, pointing.    \"Thet's a bunch of hosses,\" replied Holley.    \"Wild hosses?\"    \"I take 'em so, seein' how they throw thet dust.\"    \"Huh! I don't like it. Lucy oughtn't be ridin' round alone.\"    \"Wal, boss, who could catch her up on Buckles? Lucy can ride. An'  there's the King an' Sarch right under your nose--the only hosses on  the sage thet could outrun Buckles.\"    Farlane knew how to mollify his master and long habit had made him  proficient. Bostil's eyes flashed. He was proud of Lucy's power over a  horse. The story Bostil first told to any stranger happening by the  Ford was how Lucy had been born during a wild ride--almost, as it were,  on the back of a horse. That, at least, was her fame, and the riders  swore she was a worthy daughter of such a mother. Then, as Farlane well  knew, a quick road to Bostil's good will was to praise one of his  favorites.    \"Reckon you spoke sense for once, Farlane,\" replied Bostil, with  relief. \"I wasn't thinkin' so much of danger for Lucy.... But she lets  thet half-witted Creech go with her.\"    \"No, boss, you're wrong,\" put in Holley, earnestly. \"I know the girl.  She has no use fer Joel. But he jest runs after her.\"    \"An' he's harmless,\" added Farlane.    \"We ain't agreed,\" rejoined Bostil, quickly. \"What do you say, Holley?\"    The old rider looked thoughtful and did not speak for long.    \"Wal, Yes an' no,\" he answered, finally. \"I reckon Lucy could make a  man out of Joel. But she doesn't care fer him, an' thet settles  thet.... An' maybe Joel's leanin' toward the bad.\"    \"If she meets him again I'll rope her in the house,\" declared Bostil.    Another clear-eyed rider drew Bostil's attention from the gray waste of  rolling sage.    \"Bostil, look! Look at the King! He's watchin' fer somethin'.... An'  so's Sarch.\"    The two horses named were facing a ridge some few hundred yards  distant, and their heads were aloft and ears straight forward. Sage  King whistled shrilly and Sarchedon began to prance.    \"Boys, you'd better drive them in,\" said Bostil. \"They'd like nothin'  so well as gettin' out on the sage.... Hullo! what's thet shootin' up  behind the ridge?\"    \"No more 'n Buckles with Lucy makin' him run some,\" replied Holley,  with a dry laugh.    \"If it ain't! ... Lord! look at him come!\"    Bostil's anger and anxiety might never have been. The light of the  upland rider's joy shone in his keen gaze. The slope before him was  open, and almost level, down to the ridge that had hidden the missing  girl and horse. Buckles was running for the love of"]]]
