CHRISTIE    With Drawings by the Author and Other Illustrations    Second Edition Revised  (A reprint of the First Edition, with various slight alterations in  text)    Third Edition Revised  (A reprint of the Second Edition)                Published by John Hogg  13 Paternoster Row  London 1912        [Illustration: _Frontispiece  See page 249._]        Printed by Ballantyne, Hanson & Co.  at the Ballantyne Press, Edinburgh          EDITOR'S PREFACE      Needlework, which is still practised traditionally in every house, was  once a splendid art, an art in which English workers were especially  famous, so that, early in the XIIIth century, vestments embroidered in  England were eagerly accepted in Rome, and the kind of work wrought here  was known over Europe as \"English Work.\" Embroideries _facon  d'Angleterre_ often occupy the first place in foreign inventories.    At Durham are preserved some beautiful fragments of embroidery worked in  the Xth century, and many examples, belonging to the great period of the  XIIIth and XIVth centuries, are preserved at the South Kensington  Museum, which is particularly rich in specimens of this art. In order to  judge of what were then its possibilities it is worth while to go and  see there three notable copes, the blue cope, the Sion cope, and the  rose-colour Jesse-tree cope, the last two of which are certainly  English, and the former probably so. The Sion cope bears a remnant of an  inscription which has unfortunately been cut down and otherwise injured,  so that all that I have been able to read is as follows: DAVN PERS : DE  : V ...; probably the name of the donor.    In the XIIIth century the craft of embroidery was practised both by men  and women.    That great art patron, Henry the Third, chiefly employed for his  embroideries, says Mr. Hudson Turner, \"a certain Mabel of Bury St.  Edmund's, whose skill as an embroideress seems to have been remarkable,  and many interesting records of her curious performances might be  collected.\" And I have found a record of an embroidered chasuble made  for the king by \"Mabilia\" of St. Edmund's in 1242. The most splendid  piece of embroidery produced for this king must have been the altar  frontal of Westminster Abbey, completed about 1269. It was silk,  garnished with pearls, jewels, and translucent enamels. Four  embroideresses worked on it for three years and three-quarters, and it  seems to have cost a sum equal to about L3000 of our money.    \"The London Broderers\" did not receive a formal charter of incorporation  until 1561, but they must have been a properly organised craft centuries  before. In 2 Henry IV. it was reported to Parliament that divers persons  of the \"Craft of Brauderie\" made unfit work of inferior materials,  evading the search of \"the Wardens of Brauderie\" in the said City of  London.    In Paris, in the year 1295, there were ninety-three embroiderers and  embroideresses registered as belonging to the trade. The term of  apprenticeship to the craft was for eight years, and no employer might  take more than one apprentice at a time. In the XVIth century the Guild  was at the height of its power, and embroideries were so much in demand  that the Jardin des Plantes in Paris was established to furnish  flower-subjects for embroidery design. It was founded by the gardener,  Jean Robin, and by Pierre Vallet, \"brodeur\" to Henry IV. In the XVIIIth  century the company numbered 250 past-masters.    To this craft the present volume forms, I believe, an admirable  introduction and text-book, not only on the side of workmanship, but  also on that difficult subject, \"design\"--difficult, that is, from its  having been so much discussed in books, yet entirely simple when  approached, as here, as a necessary part of workmanship. It is fortunate  that we have not as yet learned to bother our cooks as to which part of  their work is designing and which is merely mechanical. Of course the  highest things of design, as well as of workmanship, come only after  long practice and to the specially gifted, but none the less every human  creature must in some sort be a designer, and it has caused immense harm  to raise a cloud of what Morris called \"sham technical twaddle\" between  the worker and what should be the spontaneous inspiration of his work.  What such combination has produced in past times, may perhaps best be  understood by some reading in old church inventories of the simply  infinite store of magnificent embroidered vestments which once adorned  our churches. In an inventory of Westminster Abbey I find mentioned  such patterns as roses and birds, fleur-de-luces and lybardes, angels on  branches of gold, roses and ships, eagles and angels of gold, castles  and lions, white harts, swans, dogs, and antelopes.

LETHABY.    _September 1906._          AUTHOR'S PREFACE      In the following pages the practical sides of Embroidery and Tapestry  Weaving are discussed, their historical development being only  incidentally touched upon.    The drawings illustrating design and the practical application of  stitches have been taken almost without exception from actual Embroidery  or Tapestry; the exceptions, where it has been impossible to consult  originals, from photographic representations obtained from various  sources, among which the collection of M. Louis de Farcy should be  mentioned.    I have to thank Miss May Morris and Mrs. W. R. Lethaby for permission to  reproduce pieces of their work, and Miss Killick, Colonel J. E.  Butler-Bowdon, the Viscount Falkland, and the Reverend F. J. Brown of  Steeple Aston for permission to reproduce work in their possession. Also  I must thank the authorities of the Victoria and Albert Museum for help  in various ways, and Mr. J. H. Taylor, M.A. Oxf. and Cam., for his  kindness in reading the proofs.

London: Edward Arnold  1920  (All rights reserved)          PREFACE      Two of these stories, the third and fourth, have appeared in print in  the _Cambridge Review_, and I wish to thank the proprietor for  permitting me to republish them here.    I have had my doubts about the wisdom of publishing a third set of  tales; sequels are, not only proverbially but actually, very hazardous  things. However, the tales make no pretence but to amuse, and my  friends have not seldom asked for the publication. So not a great deal  is risked, perhaps, and perhaps also some one's Christmas may be the  cheerfuller for a storybook which, I think, only once mentions the  war.

He was a man of some fifty-five years, strongly made, of  a sanguine complexion, an angry eye, and a long upper lip. Face and  eye were lighted up at the moment when I picture him by the level ray  of an afternoon sun that shone in upon him through a tall sash window,  giving on the west. The room into which it shone was also tall, lined  with book-cases, and, where the wall showed between them, panelled. On  the table near the doctor's elbow was a green cloth, and upon it what  he would have called a silver standish--a tray with inkstands--quill  pens, a calf-bound book or two, some papers, a churchwarden pipe and  brass tobacco-box, a flask cased in plaited straw, and a liqueur  glass. The year was 1730, the month December, the hour somewhat past  three in the afternoon.    I have described in these lines pretty much all that a superficial  observer would have noted when he looked into the room. What met Dr.  Ashton's eye when he looked out of it, sitting in his leather  arm-chair? Little more than the tops of the shrubs and fruit-trees of  his garden could be seen from that point, but the red brick wall of it  was visible in almost all the length of its western side. In the  middle of that was a gate--a double gate of rather elaborate iron  scroll-work, which allowed something of a view beyond. Through it he  could see that the ground sloped away almost at once to a bottom,  along which a stream must run, and rose steeply from it on the other  side, up to a field that was park-like in character, and thickly  studded with oaks, now, of course, leafless. They did not stand so  thick together but that some glimpse of sky and horizon could be seen  between their stems. The sky was now golden and the horizon, a horizon  of distant woods, it seemed, was purple.    But all that Dr. Ashton could find to say, after contemplating this  prospect for many minutes, was: \"Abominable!\"    A listener would have been aware, immediately upon this, of the sound  of footsteps coming somewhat hurriedly in the direction of the study:  by the resonance he could have told that they were traversing a much  larger room. Dr. Ashton turned round in his chair as the door opened,  and looked expectant. The incomer was a lady--a stout lady in the  dress of the time: though I have made some attempt at indicating the  doctor's costume, I will not enterprise that of his wife--for it was  Mrs. Ashton who now entered. She had an anxious, even a sorely  distracted, look, and it was in a very disturbed voice that she almost  whispered to Dr. Ashton, putting her head close to his, \"He's in a  very sad way, love, worse, I'm afraid.\" \"Tt--tt, is he really?\" and he  leaned back and looked in her face. She nodded. Two solemn bells, high  up, and not far away, rang out the half-hour at this moment. Mrs.  Ashton started. \"Oh, do you think you can give order that the minster  clock be stopped chiming to-night? 'Tis just over his chamber, and  will keep him from sleeping, and to sleep is the only chance for him,  that's certain.\" \"Why, to be sure, if there were need, real need, it  could be done, but not upon any light occasion. This Frank, now, do  you assure me that his recovery stands upon it?\" said Dr. Ashton: his  voice was loud and rather hard. \"I do verily believe it,\" said his  wife. \"Then, if it must be, bid Molly run across to Simpkins and say  on my authority that he is to stop the clock chimes at sunset:  and--yes--she is after that to say to my lord Saul that I wish to see  him presently in this room.\" Mrs. Ashton hurried off.    Before any other visitor enters, it will be well to explain the  situation.    Dr. Ashton was the holder, among other preferments, of a prebend in  the rich collegiate church of Whitminster, one of the foundations  which, though not a cathedral, survived dissolution and reformation,  and retained its constitution and endowments for a hundred years after  the time of which I write. The great church, the residences of the  dean and the two prebendaries, the choir and its appurtenances, were  all intact and in working order. A dean who flourished soon after 1500  had been a great builder, and had erected a spacious quadrangle of red  brick adjoining the church for the residence of the officials. Some of  these persons were no longer required: their offices had dwindled  down to mere titles, borne by clergy or lawyers in the town and  neighbourhood; and so the houses that had been meant to accommodate  eight or ten people were now shared among three, the dean and the two  prebendaries. Dr. Ashton's included what had been the common parlour  and the dining-hall of the whole body. It occupied a whole side of the  court, and at one end had a private door into the minster. The other  end, as we have seen, looked out over the country.    So much for the house. As for the inmates, Dr. Ashton was a wealthy  man and childless, and he had adopted, or rather undertaken to bring  up, the orphan son of his wife's sister. Frank Sydall was the lad's  name: he had been a good many months in the house. Then one day came a  letter from an Irish peer, the Earl of Kildonan (who had known Dr.  Ashton at college), putting it to the doctor whether he would consider  taking into his family the Viscount Saul, the Earl's heir, and acting  in some sort as his tutor. Lord Kildonan was shortly to take up a post  in the Lisbon Embassy, and the boy was unfit to make the voyage: \"not  that he is sickly,\" the Earl wrote, \"though you'll find him whimsical,  or of late I've thought him so, and to confirm this, 'twas only  to-day his old nurse came expressly to tell me he was possess'd: but  let that pass; I'll warrant you can find a spell to make all straight.  Your arm was stout enough in old days, and I give you plenary  authority to use it as you see fit. The truth is, he has here no boys  of his age or quality to consort with, and is given to moping about in  our raths and graveyards: and he brings home romances that fright my  servants out of their wits. So there are you and your lady  forewarned.\" It was perhaps with half an eye open to the possibility  of an Irish bishopric (at which another sentence in the Earl's letter  seemed to hint) that Dr. Ashton accepted the charge of my Lord  Viscount Saul and of the 200 guineas a year that were to come with  him.    So he came, one night in September. When he got out of the chaise that  brought him, he went first and spoke to the postboy and gave him some  money, and patted the neck of his horse. Whether he made some movement  that scared it or not, there was very nearly a nasty accident, for the  beast started violently, and the postilion being unready was thrown  and lost his fee, as he found afterwards, and the chaise lost some  paint on the gateposts, and the wheel went over the man's foot who was  taking out the baggage. When Lord Saul came up the steps into the  light of the lamp in the porch to be greeted by Dr. Ashton, he was  seen to be a thin youth of, say, sixteen years old, with straight  black hair and the pale colouring that is common to such a figure. He  took the accident and commotion calmly enough, and expressed a proper  anxiety for the people who had been, or might have been, hurt: his  voice was smooth and pleasant, and without any trace, curiously, of an  Irish brogue.    Frank Sydall was a younger boy, perhaps of eleven or twelve, but Lord  Saul did not for that reject his company. Frank was able to teach him  various games he had not known in Ireland, and he was apt at learning  them; apt, too, at his books, though he had had little or no regular  teaching at home. It was not long before he was making a shift to  puzzle out the inscriptions on the tombs in the minster, and he would  often put a question to the doctor about the old books in the library  that required some thought to answer. It is to be supposed that he  made himself very agreeable to the servants, for within ten days of  his coming they were almost falling over each other in their efforts  to oblige him. At the same time, Mrs. Ashton was rather put to it to  find new maidservants; for there were several changes, and some of the  families in the town from which she had been accustomed to draw seemed  to have no one available. She was forced to go further afield"]]]
