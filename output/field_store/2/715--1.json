The  Bulgarians, a generation ago, had been paraded before the eyes of the  British people by the fiery eloquence of Mr. Gladstone as a deeply  suffering people, wretched victims of Turkish atrocities. After the wide  sympathy that followed his Bulgarian Atrocities campaign there came a  strong reaction. It was maintained that the Bulgarians were by no means  the blameless victims of the Turks; and could themselves initiate  massacres as well as suffer from them. Some even charged that there was  a good deal of party spirit to account for the heat of Mr. Gladstone's  championship. I think that the average British opinion in 1912 was that,  regarding the quarrels between Bulgar and Turk, there was a great deal  to be said against both sides; and that no Balkan people was worth a  moment's sentimental worry. \"Let dogs delight to bark and bite, for 'tis  their nature to,\" expressed the common view when one heard that there  had been murders and village-burnings again in the Balkans.    Certainly there were enthusiasts who held to the old Gladstonian faith  that there was some peculiar merit in the Bulgarian people which  justified all that they did, and which would justify Great Britain  in going into the most dangerous of wars on their behalf. These  enthusiasts, as if to make more startlingly clear their love for  Bulgaria, commonly took a profoundly pacific view of all other questions  of international politics, and would become passionately indignant at  the suggestion that the British Power should ever move navy or army in  defence of any selfish British interest. They were--they still are, it  may be said--the leading lights of what is called the Peace-at-any-price  party, detesting war and \"jingoism,\" and viewing patriotism, when found  growing on British soil, with dry suspicion. Patriotism in Bulgaria is,  however, to their view a growth of a different order, worthy to be  encouraged and sheltered at any cost.    As a counter-weight to these enthusiasts, Great Britain sheltered a  little band, usually known as pro-Turks, who believed, with almost as  passionate a sincerity as that of the pro-Bulgarians, that the Turk  was the only gentleman in Europe, and that his mild and blameless  aspirations towards setting up the perfect State were being cruelly  thwarted by the abominable Bulgars and other Balkan riff-raff. Good  government in the Balkans would come, they held, if the tide of Turkish  rule flowed forward and the restless, semi-savage, murderous Balkan  Christian states went back to peace and philosophic calm under the  wise rule of Cadi administering the will of the Khalifate.    But pro-Bulgarian and pro-Turk made comparatively few converts in Great  Britain. They formed influential little groups and inspired debates in  the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and published literature,  and went out as missions to their beloved nationalities, and had all  their affection confirmed again by the fine appreciation showered upon  them. The great mass of British public opinion, however, they did not  touch. There was never a second flaming campaign because of Turkish  atrocities towards Bulgaria, and the pro-Turks never had a sufficient  sense of humour to suggest a counter-campaign when Bulgarians made  reprisals. In official circles the general attitude towards Balkan  affairs was one of vexation alternating with indifference.    \"Those detestable Balkans!\" quoth one diplomat in an undiplomatic  moment: and expressed well the official mind. \"They are six of one and  half a dozen of the other,\" said the man in the street when he heard of  massacres, village-burnings, and tortures in the Balkans; and he turned  to the football news with undisturbed mind, seeking something on which a  fair opinion could be formed without too much worry.    The view of the man in the street was my view in 1912. I can recall  being contented in my mind to know that at any rate one's work as a war  correspondent would not be disturbed by any sympathy for the one side  or the other. Whichever side lost it would deserve to have lost, and  whatever reduction in the population of the Balkan Peninsula was caused  by the war would be ultimately a benefit to Europe. In parts of America  where the race feeling is strongest, they say that the only good nigger  is a dead nigger. So I felt about the Balkan populations. The feelings  of a man with some interest in flocks of sheep on hearing that war had  broken out between the wolves and the jackals would represent fairly  well the attitude of mind in which I packed my kit for the Balkans.    It is well to put on record that mental foundation on which I built up  my impressions of the Balkans generally, and of the Bulgarian people  particularly, for at the present time (1914) I think it may safely be  said that the Bulgarian people are somewhat under a cloud, and are not  standing too high in the opinion of the civilised world. Yet, to give  an honest record of my observations of them, I shall have to praise  them very highly in some respects. Whilst it would be going too far to  say that the praise is reluctant, it is true that it has been in a  way forced from me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22260"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Abbey Church of Tewkesbury (#1)"],[1,"*       *       *       *       *        +-----------------------------------------------------------+      | Transcriber's Note:                                       |      |                                                           |      | Inconsistent hyphenation in the original document has     |      | been preserved.                                           |      |                                                           |      | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.
