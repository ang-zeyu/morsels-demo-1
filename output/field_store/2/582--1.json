(Gruenwald.)]    EXPLANATION OF THE COLORED ILLUSTRATIONS.    They contrast with each other in that the one (upper) is too red; the  other, too pale. The upper represents appearances such as one gets  with the laryngoscope when the subject has a very severe cold, or even  inflammation of the larynx, including the central vocal bands. In this  particular case, a young woman of twenty-five years of age, there was  inflammation with a certain amount of weakness of the internal  thyro-arytenoid muscles. Speaking was almost impossible, and such  voice as was produced was of a very rough character. In the lower  illustration we have the appearances presented in a man affected with  tuberculosis of the lungs and larynx. The pallor of the larynx is  characteristic. There is weakness of the internal thyro-arytenoid  muscle on the right side, which results in imperfect tension of the  vocal band on that side, so that the voice is uncertain and harsh.  Such illustrations are introduced to impress the normal by contrast.  The reader is strongly advised to compare these figures with others in  the body of the work, especially those of Chapter VII.          PREFACE TO THE FOURTH REVISED AND ENLARGED EDITION.      In addition to certain emendations, etc., introduced throughout the  work, I have thought it well to add a chapter in which the whole  subject is treated in a broad and comprehensive way in the light of  the latest scientific knowledge.    In this review the psychological aspects of the subject have not been  neglected, and the whole has been related to practice to as great an  extent as the character of the book permits.    It is significant that on both sides of the Atlantic there is a  growing conviction that the foundations for speaking and singing as an  art must be made as scientific as the state of our knowledge will  permit.    THE AUTHOR.    January, 1913.          PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.      No preface to the Second Edition was written, so few were the changes  that were made in the work, and the same might apply to this Third  Edition. However, the fact that within a period of less than two  years, a Second English and a Third American Edition have been called  for, seems to the Author to be so conclusive an endorsement of the  application of science to vocal art, that he may be entitled at least  to express his gratification at the progress the cause, to which he  has devoted his pen, is making. It would seem that the better portion  at least of that public that is interested in the progress of vocal  art has made up its mind that the time has come when sense and science  must replace tradition and empiricism.    THE AUTHOR.    MONTREAL, September, 1908.          PREFACE.      The present work is based on a life study of the voice, and has grown  out of the conviction that all teaching and learning in voice-culture,  whether for the purposes of singing or speaking, should as far as  possible rest on a scientific foundation.    The author, believing that practice and principles have been too much  separated, has endeavored to combine them in this book. His purpose  has not been to write an exhaustive work on vocal physiology, with  references at every step to the views of various authors; rather has  he tried always to keep in mind the real needs of the practical  voice-user, and to give him a sure foundation for the principles that  must underlie sound practice. A perusal of the first chapter of the  work will give the reader a clearer idea of the author's purpose as  briefly expressed above.    The writer bespeaks an unprejudiced hearing, being convinced that in  art as in all else there is but one ultimate court of appeal: to the  scientific, the demonstrable--to what lies at the very foundations of  human nature.    In conclusion, the author desires to thank those publishers and  authors who have kindly permitted the use of their illustrations.    THE AUTHOR.

Limited  Riverside Press, Edinburgh            GENERAL PREFACE      This series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the  great English Cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide-books  at a popular price. The aim of each writer has been to produce a work  compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the  student of Archaeology and History, and yet not too technical in  language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case  would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general  sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful  are:--(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in  questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2)  the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the  Transactions of the Antiquarian and Archaeological Societies; (3) the  important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master  of the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the  English Cathedrals; and (5) the excellent series of Handbooks to the  Cathedrals originated by the late Mr. John Murray; to which the reader  may in most cases be referred for further detail, especially in  reference to the histories of the respective sees.

When William Rufus returned southwards after re-establishing the city of  Carlisle, he left as governor a rich Norman priest named Walter. He  began at once to build a church to be dedicated to the Blessed Virgin  Mary, which was to have in connection with it a college of secular  canons. Walter did not, however, live to see the building finished, and  Henry I. took it upon himself to complete the good work. It is said that  his wife on one hand, and his chaplain on the other, urged him to do  this. By the beginning of the twelfth century (1123) he founded and  endowed a priory of regular Augustinian canons, making his chaplain the  first prior.    Ten years afterwards--1133--Henry founded the see of Carlisle, and the  priory church became the cathedral. At its endowment Henry laid on the  altar the famous \"cornu eburneum,\" now lost. This horn was given,  instead of a written document, as proof of the grants of tithes. Its  virtue was tried in 1290 when the prior claimed some tithes on land in  the forest of Inglewood, but it was decided that the grant did not  originally cover the tithes in dispute. \"The ceremony of investiture  with a horn is very ancient, and was in use before there were any  written charters.
