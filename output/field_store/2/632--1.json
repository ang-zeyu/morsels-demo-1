THE RELIGION OF THE                        BABYLONIANS AND ASSYRIANS                                      CHAPTER I                                   FOREWORD                              Position, and Period.    The religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians was the polytheistic  faith professed by the peoples inhabiting the Tigris and Euphrates  valleys from what may be regarded as the dawn of history until the  Christian era began, or, at least, until the inhabitants were brought  under the influence of Christianity. The chronological period covered  may be roughly estimated at about 5000 years. The belief of the  people, at the end of that time, being Babylonian heathenism leavened  with Judaism, the country was probably ripe for the reception of the  new faith. Christianity, however, by no means replaced the earlier  polytheism, as is evidenced by the fact, that the worship of Nebo and  the gods associated with him continued until the fourth century of the  Christian era.                                By whom followed.    It was the faith of two distinct peoples--the Sumero-Akkadians, and  the Assyro-Babylonians. In what country it had its beginnings is  unknown--it comes before us, even at the earliest period, as a faith  already well-developed, and from that fact, as well as from the names  of the numerous deities, it is clear that it began with the former  race--the Sumero-Akkadians--who spoke a non-Semitic language largely  affected by phonetic decay, and in which the grammatical forms had in  certain cases become confused to such an extent that those who study  it ask themselves whether the people who spoke it were able to  understand each other without recourse to devices such as the \"tones\"  to which the Chinese resort. With few exceptions, the names of the  gods which the inscriptions reveal to us are all derived from this  non-Semitic language, which furnishes us with satisfactory etymologies  for such names as Merodach, Nergal, Sin, and the divinities mentioned  in Berosus and Damascius, as well as those of hundreds of deities  revealed to us by the tablets and slabs of Babylonia and Assyria.                                  The documents.    Outside the inscriptions of Babylonia and Assyria, there is but little  bearing upon the religion of those countries, the most important  fragment being the extracts from Berosus and Damascius referred to  above. Among the Babylonian and Assyrian remains, however, we have an  extensive and valuable mass of material, dating from the fourth or  fifth millennium before Christ until the disappearance of the  Babylonian system of writing about the beginning of the Christian era.  The earlier inscriptions are mostly of the nature of records, and give  information about the deities and the religion of the people in the  course of descriptions of the building and rebuilding of temples, the  making of offerings, the performance of ceremonies, etc. Purely  religious inscriptions are found near the end of the third millennium  before Christ, and occur in considerable numbers, either in the  original Sumerian text, or in translations, or both, until about the  third century before Christ. Among the more recent inscriptions--those  from the library of the Assyrian king Assur-bani-apli and the later  Babylonian temple archives,--there are many lists of deities, with  numerous identifications with each other and with the heavenly bodies,  and explanations of their natures. It is needless to say that all this  material is of enormous value for the study of the religion of the  Babylonians and Assyrians, and enables us to reconstruct at first hand  their mythological system, and note the changes which took place in  the course of their long national existence. Many interesting and  entertaining legends illustrate and supplement the information given  by the bilingual lists of gods, the bilingual incantations and hymns,  and the references contained in the historical and other documents. A  trilingual list of gods enables us also to recognise, in some cases,  the dialectic forms of their names.                          The importance of the subject.    Of equal antiquity with the religion of Egypt, that of Babylonia and  Assyria possesses some marked differences as to its development.  Beginning among the non-Semitic Sumero-Akkadian population, it  maintained for a long time its uninterrupted development, affected  mainly by influences from within, namely, the homogeneous local cults  which acted and reacted upon each other. The religious systems of  other nations did not greatly affect the development of the early  non-Semitic religious system of Babylonia. A time at last came,  however, when the influence of the Semitic inhabitants of Babylonia  and Assyria was not to be gainsaid, and from that moment, the  development of their religion took another turn. In all probably this  augmentation of Semitic religious influence was due to the increased  numbers of the Semitic population, and at the same period the  Sumero-Akkadian language began to give way to the Semitic idiom which  they spoke. When at last the Semitic Babylonian language came to be used  for official documents, we find that, although the non-Semitic divine  names are in the main preserved, a certain number of them have been  displaced by the Semitic equivalent names, such as Samas for the  sun-god, with Kittu and Mesaru (\"justice and righteousness\") his  attendants; Nabu (\"the teacher\" = Nebo) with his consort Tasmetu (\"the  hearer\"); Addu, Adad, or Dadu, and Rammanu, Ramimu, or Ragimu = Hadad  or Rimmon (\"the thunderer\"); Bel and Beltu (Beltis = \"the lord\" and  \"the lady\" /par excellence/), with some others of inferior rank. In  place of the chief divinity of each state at the head of each separate  pantheon, the tendency was to make Merodach, the god of the capital  city Babylon, the head of the pantheon, and he seems to have been  universally accepted in Babylonia, like Assur in Assyria, about 2000  B.C. or earlier.                          The uniting of two pantheons.    We thus find two pantheons, the Sumero-Akkadian with its many gods,  and the Semitic Babylonian with its comparatively few, united, and  forming one apparently homogeneous whole. But the creed had taken a  fresh tendency. It was no longer a series of small, and to a certain  extent antagonistic, pantheons composed of the chief god, his consort,  attendants, children, and servants, but a pantheon of considerable  extent, containing all the elements of the primitive but smaller  pantheons, with a number of great gods who had raised Merodach to be  their king.                                   In Assyria.    Whilst accepting the religion of Babylonia, Assyria nevertheless kept  herself distinct from her southern neighbour by a very simple device,  by placing at the head of the pantheon the god Assur, who became for  her the chief of the gods, and at the same time the emblem of her  distinct national aspirations--for Assyria had no intention whatever  of casting in her lot with her southern neighbour. Nevertheless,  Assyria possessed, along with the language of Babylonia, all the  literature of that country--indeed, it is from the libraries of her  kings that we obtain the best copies of the Babylonian religious  texts, treasured and preserved by her with all the veneration of which  her religious mind was capable,--and the religious fervour of the  Oriental in most cases leaves that of the European, or at least of the  ordinary Briton, far behind.                           The later period in Assyria.    Assyria went to her downfall at the end of the seventh century before  Christ worshipping her national god Assur, whose cult did not cease  with the destruction of her national independence. In fact, the city  of Assur, the centre of that worship, continued to exist for a  considerable period; but for the history of the religion of Assyria,  as preserved there, we wait for the result of the excavations being  carried on by the Germans, should they be fortunate enough to obtain  texts belonging to the period following the fall of Nineveh.                                  In Babylonia.    Babylonia, on the other hand, continued the even tenor of her way.  More successful at the end of her independent political career than  her northern rival had been, she retained her faith, and remained the  unswerving worshipper of Merodach, the great god of Babylon, to whom  her priests attributed yet greater powers, and with whom all the other  gods were to all appearance identified.

You've struck a heap of trouble,       The Harpy      There was a woman, and she was wise; woefully wise was she,       Premonition      'Twas a year ago, and the moon was bright,       The Tramps      Can you recall, dear comrade, when we tramped God's land together,       L'Envoi      You who have lived in the land,              The Spell of the Yukon           I wanted the gold, and I sought it,      I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.     Was it famine or scurvy -- I fought it;      I hurled my youth into a grave.     I wanted the gold, and I got it --      Came out with a fortune last fall, --     Yet somehow life's not what I thought it,      And somehow the gold isn't all.       No!  There's the land.  (Have you seen it?)      It's the cussedest land that I know,     From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it      To the deep, deathlike valleys below.     Some say God was tired when He made it;      Some say it's a fine land to shun;     Maybe; but there's some as would trade it      For no land on earth -- and I'm one.       You come to get rich (damned good reason);      You feel like an exile at first;     You hate it like hell for a season,      And then you are worse than the worst.     It grips you like some kinds of sinning;      It twists you from foe to a friend;     It seems it's been since the beginning;      It seems it will be to the end.       I've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow      That's plumb-full of hush to the brim;     I've watched the big, husky sun wallow      In crimson and gold, and grow dim,     Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,      And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;     And I've thought that I surely was dreaming,      With the peace o' the world piled on top.       The summer -- no sweeter was ever;      The sunshiny woods all athrill;     The grayling aleap in the river,      The bighorn asleep on the hill.     The strong life that never knows harness;      The wilds where the caribou call;     The freshness, the freedom, the farness --      O God! how I'm stuck on it all.       The winter! the brightness that blinds you,      The white land locked tight as a drum,     The cold fear that follows and finds you,      The silence that bludgeons you dumb.     The snows that are older than history,      The woods where the weird shadows slant;     The stillness, the moonlight, the mystery,      I've bade 'em good-by -- but I can't.       There's a land where the mountains are nameless,      And the rivers all run God knows where;     There are lives that are erring and aimless,      And deaths that just hang by a hair;     There are hardships that nobody reckons;      There are valleys unpeopled and still;     There's a land -- oh, it beckons and beckons,      And I want to go back -- and I will.       They're making my money diminish;      I'm sick of the taste of champagne.     Thank God! when I'm skinned to a finish      I'll pike to the Yukon again.     I'll fight -- and you bet it's no sham-fight;      It's hell! -- but I've been there before;     And it's better than this by a damsite --      So me for the Yukon once more.       There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting;      It's luring me on as of old;     Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting      So much as just finding the gold.     It's the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder,      It's the forests where silence has lease;     It's the beauty that thrills me with wonder,      It's the stillness that fills me with peace.          The Heart of the Sourdough           There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon,     There where the sullen sun-dogs glare in the snow-bright, bitter noon,     And the glacier-glutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June.       There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows;     There where the silences are spawned, and the light of hell-fire flows     Into the bowl of the midnight sky, violet, amber and rose.       There where the rapids churn and roar, and the ice-floes bellowing run;     Where the tortured, twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun --     I've packed my kit and I'm going, boys, ere another day is done.            *    *    *    *    *       I knew it would call, or soon or late, as it calls the whirring wings;     It's the olden lure, it's the golden lure,       it's the lure of the timeless things,     And to-night, oh, God of the trails untrod,       how it whines in my heart-strings!       I'm sick to death of your well-groomed gods, your make believe and your show;     I long for a whiff of bacon and beans, a snug shakedown in the snow;     A trail to break, and a life at stake, and another bout with the foe.       With the raw-ribbed Wild that abhors all life,       the Wild that would crush and rend,     I have clinched and closed with the naked North,       I have learned to defy and defend;     Shoulder to shoulder we have fought it out --       yet the Wild must win in the end.       I have flouted the Wild.  I have followed its lure,       fearless, familiar, alone;     By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own;     Yet the Wild must win, and a day will come when I shall be overthrown.       Then when as wolf-dogs fight we've fought, the lean wolf-land and I;     Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky;     Even as lean wolf-dog goes down will I go down and die.          The Three Voices           The waves have a story to tell me,      As I lie on the lonely beach;     Chanting aloft in the pine-tops,      The wind has a lesson to teach;     But the stars sing an anthem of glory      I cannot put into speech.       The waves tell of ocean spaces,      Of hearts that are wild and brave,     Of populous city places,      Of desolate shores they lave,     Of men who sally in quest of gold      To sink in an ocean grave.       The wind is a mighty roamer;      He bids me keep me free,     Clean from the taint of the gold-lust,      Hardy and pure as he;     Cling with my love to nature,      As a child to the mother-knee.
