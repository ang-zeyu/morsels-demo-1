The aim of each writer has been to produce a work  compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the  student of Archaeology and History, and yet not too technical in  language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case  would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general  sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful  are:--(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in  questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2)  the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the  Transactions of the Antiquarian and Archaeological Societies; (3) the  important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master  of the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the  English Cathedrals; and (5) the very excellent series of Handbooks to  the Cathedrals originated by the late Mr John Murray; to which the  reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in  reference to the histories of the respective sees.           *       *       *       *       *          AUTHOR'S PREFACE      As much as possible of this brief description of Durham is from the  personal acquaintance of the writer with the building. Yet many  authorities have, of necessity, been consulted in its preparation,  notably a pamphlet by the Rev. Canon W. Greenwell, and the \"County of  Durham,\" by J.R. Boyle, F.S.A. Thanks are also due to the authorities of  the Cathedral for having freely given permission to make drawings and  measurements, and to the late Mr Weatherall, chief verger, for his  kindly assistance and information.    The illustrations are chiefly from sketches and drawings by the writer,  and from photographs reproduced by the kindness of the Photochrom  Company, Ltd., and Messrs S.B.

For splendid  position the Cathedral of Durham stands unequalled in this country; on  the Continent, perhaps that of Albi can alone be compared with it in  this respect. The cathedral and Norman Castle are upon the summit of a  lofty tongue of land which is almost surrounded by the River Wear. In  parts the banks are rocky and steep, in others thickly wooded. The river  itself is spanned here and there by fine and historic bridges.    The early history of Durham is obscure. There are many vague legends in  existence, a natural consequence, perhaps, when we remember the various  and often speedy changes of ownership to which that part of the country  was for centuries subjected.    To lead up clearly to the founding of the Cathedral of Durham, it will  be necessary to describe briefly the earliest introduction of  Christianity into the north of England. That Christianity was known in  this country during the time of the Romans there is sufficient evidence  to prove. There is, however, little to show that it existed in the north  to any appreciable extent. All or nearly all the carved stones, altars,  etc., disinterred in that part of the country have been of undoubted  Pagan origin.    The ancient kingdom of Northumbria comprised the present counties of  Durham, Northumberland, and Yorkshire, and a part of the south-east of  Scotland as far north as the Firth of Forth. This kingdom was  sub-divided into two portions. The Southern, or Deira, extended from the  Tees to the Humber, and the Northern, or Bernicia, reached from the Tees  to the Firth of Forth. The province of Bernicia was settled about A.D.  547 by Ida, a chief of the Angles, who made his headquarters on a steep  rock on the sea-coast about sixteen miles south of Berwick. He was  succeeded by his son Ethelric, who built himself a stronghold, which he  named after his wife Bebbanburgh, a name still retained in a shortened  form--Bamburgh. Ethelric was followed by Ella, whose son Edwin was  driven into exile by his fierce brother-in-law, Ethelfrith, and took  possession of Deira, the southern province of Northumbria. After  attaining his majority, Edwin, assisted by Redwald, regained his  kingdom, and eventually ruled over the whole of Northumbria; it is  during his reign that we find the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20194"],[0,"The Petticoat Commando: Boer Women in Secret Service (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

It is more than a  history. It is a dramatic picture of the hopes and fears, the devotion  and bitterness with which some patriotic women in Pretoria watched  and, as far as they could, took part in the war which was slowly  drawing to its conclusion on the veld outside.    I do not associate myself with the opinions expressed by the writer as  to the causes of the war or the methods adopted to bring it to an end,  or as to the policy which led to the Concentration Camps, and the  causes of the terrible mortality which prevailed during the first  months of their existence. On these matters many readers will hold  different opinions from the writer, or will prefer to let judgment be  in suspense and to look to the historian of the future for a final  verdict. We are still too near the events to be impartial. But this  book does not challenge or invite controversy. Fortunately for South  Africa, most of us on both sides can now discuss the events of the war  without bitterness and understand and respect the feelings of those  who were most sharply divided by these events from ourselves.    The greater part of the narrative comes from a diary kept during the  war with unusual fullness and vividness. The difficulty experienced by  the writer of the diary in communicating to friends outside Pretoria  information about what was passing inside, and in unburdening herself  of the feelings roused in her by the events of the war, made the diary  more than usually intimate. To understand fully many of the narratives  which have been transferred from it to this book, it must be  remembered that one is reading, not something written from memory  years after the event, but rather the record of a conversation at the  time, in which the diarist is describing the events as if to a friend  who shares to the full all her own feelings and to whom she can speak  without reserve.    Much has happened in the ten years which have passed since the end of  the war. The country which was distracted by the conflicting ideals  and interests of its different Governments and peoples has become the  Union of South Africa. It is now one State. It remains that it should  call forth a spirit of patriotism and nationality which will unite and  not divide its people.                                             PATRICK DUNCAN.    JOHANNESBURG, 1912.          INTRODUCTION      If, by inspiring feelings of patriotism in the hearts of some of my  readers, especially those members of the rising generation to whom  this story of adventure may appeal, I succeed in raising the standard  of national life, this book will have achieved the purpose for which  it was written, and I shall feel more than compensated for having set  aside the reluctance with which I faced the thought of the publicity  when first I began the work.    I have tried to give the public some idea of what was done by Boer  women, during the great Anglo-Boer war, to keep their men in the field  and to support them in what proved to be a hopeless struggle for  independence and liberty.    As far as I was able I have also described the perils and hardships  connected with the Secret Service of the Boers and the heroism and  resource displayed by the men.    Although it is with the knowledge and consent of the Boer leaders that  I give publicity to what is known to me of the methods employed in the  Secret Service of the Boers, I do not wish to convey the impression  that these events of the war at any time bore an official character.    It is a purely personal narrative and has only been written at the  repeated request, during the last ten years, of the many friends  associated with the experiences of the diarist and of the principal  characters appearing in this book.    In order to preserve the historical value of the book no fictitious  names have been employed.    There are, as far as we know, very few records of this nature in  existence, owing to the dangers connected with keeping a diary under  martial law, and it seemed a pity, therefore, to withhold from the  public materials which may be of use to those who are interested in  studying or writing the history of those critical years.    I cannot vouch for the truth of every war rumour related here, nor for  the accuracy of the information which I have obtained from other  people, but the experiences of the diarist, as they were recorded from  day to day, are correct in every detail.    My Dutch edition of this book, _Die Kappie Kommando_, is now appearing  in the Dutch South African bi-monthly journal, _Die Brandwag_, and  will, when completed, be published in book form in Holland.    In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my  thanks to the Honourable Sir Richard Solomon, G.C.M.G., etc., for the  help and assistance which he has so kindly given me in connection with  the publication of my book.
