And right it is; for of all the rivers of this        beautiful earth there is none so beautiful as this.\"                                                     Longfellow.          Prefatory Note.      Last year I made the journey between Mainz and Bonn on one of our  splendid Rhine steamers. Our vessel glided along like a great  water-bird. On the shore rose mountains, castles, and ruins, and over  all the sun shined brightly from a blue August sky. It was twelve  years since I had visited the scenes of my youth, and every  Rhinelander will understand with what pleasure I saw again those  smiling landscapes arrayed in their summer beauty. Wandering back to  my deck-chair, I soon became absorbed in the ever-changing panorama.    Then the sound of a melodious female voice speaking English fell on my  ears. I looked around. A girl was bending over a book, and  entertaining her father and mother by reading something of special  interest and beauty. I listened and recognised some of my own  sentences rendered into the speech of Shakespeare. These three were  learning to feel the charms of the Lorelei legend as I had felt it. I  confess my pulse beat quicker as I heard my poor endeavours highly  praised, and I could not refrain from advancing and thanking the young  reader for her kindly appreciation of my endeavours. She seemed  delighted when she discovered that I was the author, and rose to greet  me in the most amiable manner. I complimented the travellers that  during the past century the Rhine had become the home of romance for  the English speaking nations, the same as Italy for the Germans. The  girl smiled, and remarked that I must pay that compliment to her  mother in particular, as she was by birth an Englishwoman. But the  head of the family hastened to add that among Americans, whom he might  speak for, the enthusiasm for the beauties of the Rhine was not less  than among their Anglo-Saxon cousins. These two nations which are  bound by so many ties to each other, and also to ourselves, were thus  represented before me. The English-speaking people undoubtedly form by  far the largest contingent of our Rhine travellers, and it was  pleasant indeed to receive so fine a testimonial to the beauties of my  birth place.    We had a most interesting conversation, and I was not a little moved,  as I observed that these foreigners who had travelled over half the  world, and had seen the grandeur of Switzerland and the charms of  Italy, should have such an unaffected admiration for our grand old  river. I am rather sorry for those who neglect the Rhine. \"Aren't  Lohengrin and Siegfried, immortalised by the great Master of Bayreuth,  also heroic figures in your Rhine legends?\" remarked the young  Anglo-American enthusiastically. It was the first time I had seriously  thought of this. I was indeed touched, and my thoughts travelled back  to the days of \"long, long ago\" when as a little chap in my native  Bonn, I had first listened with interest to the charming voices of the  golden-haired daughters of old Albion who came in large numbers to  reside in the famous Beethoven-town.    As I separated from my friends at the foot of the Drachenfels I gave  them a small present to keep as a memento of the Rhine and one of its  poets.

GOTTHARD    The Petrified Alp      [Illustration: Aus dem Quellgebiet des Rheines--Near the Source of the  Rhine--Au pays du Rhin]    In the region where the Rhine has its source there towered in ancient  times a green Alp. This Alp belonged to an honest peasant, and along  with a neat little house in the valley below formed his only  possession.    The man died suddenly and was deeply mourned by his wife and child.  Some days after an unexpected visitor was announced to the widow. He  was a man who had much pastureland up in that region, but for a long  time his one desire had been to possess the Alp of his neighbour now  deceased, as by it his property would be rounded off to his  satisfaction.    Quickly making his resolution he declared to the dismayed woman that  the Alp belonged to him: her husband had secretly pledged it to him in  return for a loan, after the bad harvest of the previous year. When  the widow angrily accused him of being a liar the man produced a  promissory note, spread it out, and with a hard laugh showed her his  statement was confirmed in black and white. The distressed woman burst  into tears and declared it was impossible that her late husband should  have made a secret transaction of such a nature. The Alp was the sole  inheritance of their son, and never would she willingly surrender it.    \"I will pay you compensation for the renunciation of your claim,  although nothing obliges me to do so,\" declared the visitor with  apparent compassion, in the meantime producing his purse.    The weeping woman motioned to him to put back his gold and told him to  go, which he did.    Three days later the widow was summoned before the judge. There the  neighbour produced his document and repeated his demand for the  possession of the disputed Alp.    The judge, who had been shamefully bribed, declared the document valid  and awarded the Alp to the pursuer. The broken-hearted widow staggered  home.    The new possessor of the Alp on the other hand hastened up to the  mountains at full gallop.
