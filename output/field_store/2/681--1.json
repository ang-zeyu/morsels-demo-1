SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA.    (Used by permission of S. Brainard's Sons, owners of the copyright.)      [Illustration: MAJ. GEN'L W.T. SHERMAN.]    Our camp fires shone bright on the mountain    That frowned on the river below,  While we stood by our guns in the morning,    And eagerly watched for the foe,  When a rider came out from the darkness    That hung over mountains and tree,  And shouted, \"Boys, up and be ready,    For Sherman will march to the sea.\"    When cheer upon cheer for bold Sherman    Went up from each valley and glen,  And the bugle re-echoed the music    That came from the lips of the men,  For we knew that the stars on our banner    More bright in their splendor would be,  And that blessings from Northland would greet us    As Sherman marched down to the sea.    Then forward, boys, forward, to battle,    We marched on our wearysome way,  And we strewed the wild hills of Resaca--    God bless those who fell on that day.  Then Kennesaw, dark in its glory,    Frowned down on the flag of the free;  But the East and the West bore our standard    As Sherman marched down to the sea.    Still onward we pressed till our banner    Swept out from Atlanta's grim walls,  And the blood of the patriot dampened    The soil where traitor's flag falls.  But we paused not to weep for the fallen    Who slept by each river and tree;  Yet we twined them wreaths of the laurel    As Sherman marched down to the sea.    Proud, proud was our army that morning    That stood by the cypress and pine  When Sherman said, \"Boys, you are weary;    This day fair Savannah is thine,\"  Then sang we a song for our chieftain    That echoed o'er river and lea,  And the stars on our banner shone brighter    When Sherman marched on to the sea.

CHORUS.      \"Hurrah! hurrah! we bring the Jubilee!  Hurrah! hurrah! the flag that makes you free!\"    So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea  While we were marching through Georgia.    How the darkies shouted when they heard the joyful sound!  How the turkeys gobbled which our commissary found!  How the sweet potatoes even started from the ground,      While we were marching through Georgia!--CHORUS.    Yes, and there were Union men who wept with joyful tears  When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years;  Hardly could they be restrained from breaking forth in cheers      While we were marching through Georgia.--CHORUS.    \"Sherman's dashing Yankee boys will never reach the coast!\"  So the saucy rebel said, and 'twas a handsome boast;  Had they not forgotten, alas! to reckon with the host,      While we were marching through Georgia.--CHORUS.    So we made a thoroughfare for Freedom and her train,  Sixty miles in latitude,--three hundred to the main,  Treason fled before us, for resistance was in vain,      While we were marching through Georgia.--CHORUS.

[Illustration: ENGINEERS AND MECHANICS.]    There are bonds of all sorts in this world of ours,  Fetters of friendship and ties of flowers,    And true lovers' knots, I ween.  The boys and the girls are bound by a kiss,  But there's never a bond, old friend, like this:    We have drunk from the same canteen!    The same canteen, my soldier friend,    The same canteen;  There's never a bond like this:    We have drunk from the same canteen!    It was sometimes water and sometimes milk,  Sometimes apple-jack as fine as silk;    But, whatever the tipple has been,  We shared it together in bane or in bliss,  And I warn you, friend, when I think of this:    We have drunk from the same canteen.    We've shared our blankets and tents together,  And marched and fought in all kinds of weather,    And hungry and full we've been;  Had days of battle and days of rest,  But this memory I cling to and love the best:    We've drunk from the same canteen.    For when wounded I lay on the outer slope,  With my blood flowing fast and but little hope    On which my faint spirit might lean,  Oh! then, I remember, you crawled to my side,  And bleeding so fast it seemed both must have died,    We have drunk from the same canteen!

For most people, certainly in the so-called Western  world, the right of women to vote on a basis of equality with men seems  obvious. A century ago this was not the case, even in America, and it  required a long, arduous, and sometimes painful struggle before the  Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on  August 18, 1920.    {Why then, take steps to make available through the Gutenberg Project  an article arguing AGAINST the right of women to vote--an article  written by a woman?    {There are two reasons for doing so. The first is that Susan Fenimore  Cooper (1813-1894) was no ordinary woman. She was educated in Europe  and extremely well read; she was the daughter and literary assistant of  James Fenimore Cooper, America's first internationally recognized  novelist; and she was a naturalist and essayist of great talent whose  \"nature diary\" of her home village at Cooperstown, published as \"Rural  Hours\" in 1850, has become a classic of early American environmental  literature.    {Yet Susan Fenimore Cooper argued eloquently, bringing to her task not  only her deep religious feelings but also her very considerable  knowledge of world history and of American society, that women should  not be given the vote! Hers was not a simple defense of male dominion;  her case is combined with equally eloquent arguments in favor of higher  education for women, and for equal wages for equal work. \"Female  Suffrage,\" is thus of considerable biographic importance, throwing  important light on her views of God, of society, and of American  culture.    {At the same time, \"Female Suffrage\" demonstrates that no social  argument--however popular or politically correct today--can be  considered as self-evident. Those who favor full legal and social  equality of the sexes at the ballot box and elsewhere (as I believe I  do), should be prepared to examine and answer Susan Fenimore Cooper's  arguments to the contrary. Many of those arguments are still heard  daily in the press and on TV talk shows--not indeed to end women's  right to vote, but as arguments against further steps towards gender  equality. Unlike many modern commentators, Susan Fenimore Cooper  examines these arguments in detail, both as to their roots and their  possible effects, rather than expressing them as simplistic  sound-bites. She asks her readers to examine whether gender equality is  compatible with Christian teachings; whether universal suffrage can  ever resolve social problems; whether the \"political\" sphere is as  significant to human life as politicians believe. One need not agree  with her answers, but one can only be grateful that she forces us to  ask questions.    {Hugh C. MacDougall, Secretary, James Fenimore Cooper Society--August  1999}            FEMALE SUFFRAGE.    A LETTER TO THE CHRISTIAN WOMEN OF AMERICA.        Part I.      {Publisher's Note} [NOTE.--We have printed this Letter, which will be  continued in our next Number, not as an expression of our own views,  but simply as the plea of an earnest and thoughtful Christian woman  addressed to her fellow-countrywomen.--EDITOR OF HARPER.]        The natural position of woman is clearly, to a limited degree, a  subordinate one. Such it has always been throughout the world, in all  ages, and in many widely different conditions of society. There are  three conclusive reasons why we should expect it to continue so for the  future.    FIRST. Woman in natural physical strength is so greatly inferior to man  that she is entirely in his power, quite incapable of self-defense,  trusting to his generosity for protection. In savage life this great  superiority of physical strength makes man the absolute master, woman  the abject slave. And, although every successive step in civilisation  lessens the distance between the sexes, and renders the situation of  woman safer and easier, still, in no state of society, however highly  cultivated, has perfect equality yet existed. This difference in  physical strength must, in itself, always prevent such perfect  equality, since woman is compelled every day of her life to appeal to  man for protection, and for support.    SECONDLY. Woman is also, though in a very much less degree, inferior to  man in intellect. The difference in this particular may very probably  be only a consequence of greater physical strength, giving greater  power of endurance and increase of force to the intellectual faculty  connected with it. In many cases, as between the best individual minds  of both sexes, the difference is no doubt very slight. There have been  women of a very high order of genius; there have been very many women  of great talent; and, as regards what is commonly called cleverness, a  general quickness and clearness of mind within limited bounds, the  number of clever women may possibly have been even larger than that of  clever men. But, taking the one infallible rule for our guide, judging  of the tree by its fruits, we are met by the fact that the greatest  achievements of the race in every field of intellectual culture have  been the work of man. It is true that the advantages of intellectual  education have been, until recently, very generally on the side of man;  had those advantages been always equal, women would no doubt have had  much more of success to record. But this same fact of inferiority of  education becomes in itself one proof of the existence of a certain  degree of mental inequality. What has been the cause of this  inferiority of education? Why has not woman educated herself in past  ages, as man has done? Is it the opposition of man, and the power which  physical strength gives him, which have been the impediments? Had these  been the only obstacles, and had that general and entire equality of  intellect existed between the sexes, which we find proclaimed to-day by  some writers, and by many talkers, the genius of women would have  opened a road through these and all other difficulties much more  frequently than it has yet done. At this very hour, instead of  defending the intellect of women, just half our writing and talking  would be required to defend the intellect of men. But, so long as  woman, as a sex, has not provided for herself the same advanced  intellectual education to the same extent as men, and so long as  inferiority of intellect in man has never yet in thousands of years  been gravely discussed, while the inferiority of intellect in woman has  been during the same period generally admitted, we are compelled to  believe there is some foundation for this last opinion. The extent of  this difference, the interval that exists between the sexes, the  precise degree of inferiority on the part of women, will probably never  be satisfactorily proved.    Believing then in the greater physical powers of man, and in his  superiority, to a limited extent, in intellect also, as two sufficient  reasons for the natural subordination of woman as a sex, we have yet a  third reason for this subordination. Christianity can be proved to be  the safest and highest ally of man's nature, physical, moral, and  intellectual, that the world has yet known. It protects his physical  nature at every point by plain, stringent rules of general temperance  and moderation. To his moral nature it gives the pervading strength of  healthful purity. To his intellectual nature, while on one hand it  enjoins full development and vigorous action, holding out to the spirit  the highest conceivable aspirations, on the other it teaches the  invaluable lessons of a wise humility. This grand and holy religion,  whose whole action is healthful, whose restraints are all  blessings--this gracious religion, whose chief precepts are the love of  God and the love of man--this same Christianity confirms the  subordinate position of woman, by allotting to man the headship in  plain language and by positive precept. No system of philosophy has  ever yet worked out in behalf of woman the practical results for good  which Christianity has conferred on her. Christianity has raised woman  from slavery and made her the thoughtful companion of man; finds her  the mere toy, or the victim of his passions, and it places her by his  side, his truest friend, his most faithful counselor, his helpmeet in  every worthy and honorable task. It protects her far more effectually  than any other system. It cultivates, strengthens, elevates, purifies  all her highest endowments, and holds out to her aspirations the most  sublime for that future state of existence, where precious rewards are  promised to every faithful discharge of duty, even the most humble."]]]
