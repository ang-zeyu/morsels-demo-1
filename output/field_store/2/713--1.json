The march, even if unopposed, would have been a stupendous one, and the  warlike chiefs of Northern India, who, as yet, were not even threatened  by a British advance, would have united against an invading army from  the north, and would, had it not been of prodigious strength, have  annihilated it. The French had enormously exaggerated the power of  Tippoo Sahib, with whom they had opened negotiations, and even had their  fantastic designs succeeded, it is certain that the Tiger of Mysore  would, in a very short time, have felt as deep a hatred for them as he  did for the British.    But even had such a march been possible, the extreme danger in which an  army landed in Egypt would be placed of being cut off, by the superior  strength of the British navy, from all communication with France, should  alone have deterred them from so wild a project. The fate of the  campaign was indeed decided when the first gun was fired in the Bay of  Aboukir, and the destruction of the French fleet sealed the fate of  Napoleon's army. The noble defence of Acre by Sir Sidney Smith was the  final blow to Napoleon's projects, and from that moment it was but a  question of time when the French army would be forced to lay down its  arms, and be conveyed, in British transports, back to France. The credit  of the signal failure of the enterprise must be divided between Nelson,  Sir Sidney Smith, and Sir Ralph Abercrombie.          CONTENTS       CHAP.

MAKING A FRIEND.      Two lads were standing in one of the bastions of a fort looking over the  sea. There were neither guards nor sentinels there. The guns stood on  their carriages, looking clean and ready for action, but this was not  the result of care and attention, but simply because in so dry a climate  iron rusts but little. A close examination would have shown that the  wooden carriages on which they stood were so cracked and warped by heat  that they would have fallen to pieces at the first discharge of the guns  they upheld. Piles of cannon-balls stood between the guns, half-covered  with the drifting sand, which formed slopes half-way up the walls of the  range of barracks behind, and filled up the rooms on the lower floor.  Behind rose the city of Alexandria, with its minarets and mosques, its  palaces and its low mud-built huts. Seaward lay a fleet of noble ships  with their long lines of port-holes, their lofty masts, and network of  rigging.    \"What do you think of it, Sidi?\"    \"It is wonderful!\" his companion replied. \"How huge they are, what lines  of cannon, what great masts, as tall and as straight as palm-trees!  Truly you Franks know many things of which we in the desert are  ignorant. Think you that they could batter these forts to pieces?\"    The other laughed as he looked round. \"One of them could do that now,  Sidi, seeing that there is scarce a gun on the rampart that could be  fired in return; but were all in good order, and with British  artillerists, the whole fleet would stand but a poor chance against  them, for while their shot would do but little injury to these solid  walls, these cannon would drill the ships through and through, and if  they did not sheer off, would sink them.\"    \"But why British artillerists, brother, why not our own people?\"    \"Because you have no properly trained gunners. You know how strong  Algiers was, and yet it was attacked with success, twice by the French,  twice by ourselves, and once by us and the Dutch; but it is a rule that  a strongly defended fort cannot be attacked successfully by ships. If  these forts were in proper condition and well manned, I don't think that  even Nelson would attack them, though he might land somewhere along the  coast, attack and capture the town from the land side, and then carry  the batteries. Successful as he has been at sea, he has had some  experience as to the difficulty of taking forts. He was beaten off at  Teneriffe, and although he did succeed in getting the Danes to surrender  at Copenhagen, it's well known now that his ships really got the worst  of the fight, and that if the Danes had held on, he must have drawn off  with the loss of many of his vessels.\"    \"I know nothing of these things, brother, nor where the towns you name  are, nor who are the Danes; but it seems to me that those great ships  with all their guns would be terrible assailants. As you say, these  forts are not fit for fighting; but this is because no foes have ever  come against us by sea for so many years. What could an enemy do if they  landed?\"    \"The Mamelukes are grand horsemen, Sidi, but horsemen alone cannot win a  battle; there are the artillery and infantry to be counted with, and it  is with these that battles are won in our days, though I say not that  cavalry do not bear their share, but alone they are nothing. One  infantry square, if it be steady, can repulse a host of them; but you  may ere long see the matter put to proof, for I hear that the officers  who came on shore this morning asked if aught had been heard of the  French fleet, which had, they say, sailed from Toulon to conquer Egypt.  It is for this that the English fleet has come here.\"    \"Their bones will whiten the plains should they attempt it,\" the other  said scornfully. \"But why should they want to interfere with us, and why  should you care to prevent them doing so if they are strong enough?\"    \"Because, in the first place, we are at war with them, and would prevent  them gaining any advantage. In the second place, because Egypt is a step  on the way to India. There we are fighting with one of the great native  princes, who has, they say, been promised help by the French, who are  most jealous of us, since we have destroyed their influence there, and  deprived them of their chance of becoming masters of a large portion of  the country.\"    The conversation had been carried on in Arabic. The speakers were of  about the same age, but Edgar Blagrove was half a head taller than his  Arab friend. His father was a merchant settled in Alexandria, where  Edgar had been born sixteen years before, and except that he had spent  some two years and a half at school in England, he had never been out of  Egypt. Brought up in a polyglot household, where the nurses were French  or Italian, the grooms Arab, the gardeners Egyptians drawn from the  fellah class, and the clerks and others engaged in his father's business  for the most part Turks, Edgar had from childhood spoken all these  languages with equal facility. He had never learned them, but they had  come to him naturally as his English had done. His mother, never an  energetic woman, had felt the heat of the climate much, and had never  been, or declared she had never been--which came to the same  thing--capable of taking any exercise, and, save for a drive in her  carriage in the cool of the evening, seldom left the house.    Edgar had, from the first, been left greatly to his own devices. His  father was a busy man, and, as long as the boy was well and strong, was  content that he should spend his time as he chose, insisting only on his  taking lessons for two hours a day from the Italian governess, who  taught his twin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],[0,"Steve and the Steam Engine (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net            -----------------------------------------------------------------------    By Sara Ware Bassett    The Invention Series    Paul and the Printing Press  Steve and the Steam Engine    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    [Illustration: \"It was the conquering of this multitude of defects that  gave to the world the intricate, exquisitely made machine.\"--Frontispiece.

While his father, mother, and sister Doris had been absent in New York  for a week-end visit and Havens, the chauffeur, was ill at the hospital,  the boy had taken the big six-cylinder car from the garage without  anybody's permission and carried a crowd of his friends to Torrington to  a football game. And that was not the worst of it, either. At the foot  of the long hill leading into the village the mighty leviathan so  unceremoniously borrowed had come to a halt, refusing to move another  inch, and Stephen now sat helplessly in it, awaiting the aid his  comrades had promised to send back from the town.    What an ignominious climax to what had promised to be a royal holiday!  Steve scowled with chagrin and disappointment.    The catastrophe served him right. Unquestionably he should not have  taken the car without asking. He had never run it all by himself before,  although many times he had driven it when either his father or Havens  had been at his elbow. It had gone all right then. What reason had he to  suppose a mishap would befall him when they were not by? It was  infernally hard luck!    Goodness only knew what was the matter with the thing. Probably  something was smashed, something that might require days or even weeks  to repair, and would cost a lot of money. Here was a pretty dilemma!    How angry his father would be!    The family were going to use the automobile Saturday to take Doris back  to Northampton for the opening of college and had planned to make quite  a holiday of the trip. Now it would all have to be given up and  everybody would blame him for the disappointment. A wretched hole he was  in!    The boys had not given him much sympathy, either. They had been ready  enough to egg him on into wrong-doing and had made of the adventure the  jolliest lark imaginable; but the moment fun had been transformed into  calamity they had deserted him with incredible speed, climbing out of  the spacious tonneau and trooping jauntily off on foot to see the town.  It was easy enough for them to wash their hands of the affair and leave  him to the solitude of the roadside; the automobile was not theirs and  when they got home they would not be confronted by irate parents.    How persuasively, reflected Stephen, they had urged him on.    \"Oh, be a sport, Steve!\" Jack Curtis had coaxed. \"Who's going to be the  wiser if you do take the car? Anyhow, you have run it before, haven't  you? I don't believe your father will mind.\"    \"Take a chance, Stevie,\" his chum, Bud Taylor, pleaded. \"What's the good  of being such a boob? Do you think if my father had a car and it was  standing idle in the garage when a bunch of kids needed it to go to a  school game I would hesitate? You bet I wouldn't!\"    \"It isn't likely your Dad would balk at your using the car if he knew  the circumstances,\" piped another boy. \"We have got that match to play  off, and now that the electric cars are held up by the strike how are we  to get to Torrington? Don't be a ninny, Steve.\"    Thus they had ridiculed, cajoled, and wheedled Steve until his  conscience had been overpowered and, yielding to their arguments, he had  set forth for the adjoining village with the triumphant throng of  tempters. At first all had gone well. The fourteen miles had slipped  past with such smoothness and rapidity that Stephen, proudly enthroned  at the wheel, had almost forgotten that any shadow rested on the  hilarity of the day. He had been dubbed a good fellow, a true sport, a  benefactor to the school--every complimentary pseudonym imaginable--and  had glowed with pleasure beneath the avalanche of flattery. As the big  car with its rollicking occupants had spun along the highway, many a  passer-by had caught the merry mood of the cheering group and waved a  smiling salutation in response to their shouts.    In the meanwhile, exhilarated by the novelty of the escapade, Steve had  increased the speed until the red car fairly shot over the level  macadam, its blurred outlines lost in the scarlet of the autumn foliage.  Then suddenly when the last half-mile was reached and Torrington  village, the goal of the pilgrimage, was in sight, quite without warning  the panting monster had stopped and all attempts to urge it farther were  of no avail. There it stood, its motionless engine sending out odors of  hot varnish and little shimmering waves of heat.    Immediately a hush had descended upon the boisterous company. There was  a momentary pause, followed by a clamor of advice. When, however, it  became evident that there was no prospect of restoring the disabled  machine to action, one after another of the frightened schoolboys had  dropped out over the sides of the car and after loitering an instant or  two with a sort of shamefaced indecision, at the suggestion of Bud  Taylor they had all set out for the town.    \"Tough luck, old chap!\" Bud had called over his shoulder. \"Mighty tough  luck! Wish we had time to wait and see what's queered the thing; but the  game is called at two-thirty, you know, and we have only about time to  make it. We'll try and hunt up a garage and send somebody back to help  you. So long!\"    And away they had trooped without so much as a backward glance, leaving  Stephen alone on the country road, worried, mortified, and resentful.  There was no excuse for their heartless conduct, he fumed indignantly.  They were not all on the eleven. Five of the team had come over in Tim  Barclay's Ford, so that several of the fellows Steve had brought were  merely to be spectators of the game. At least Bud Taylor, his especial  crony, was not playing. He might have remained behind. How selfish  people were, and what a fleeting thing was popularity! Why, half an hour  ago he had been the idol of the crowd! Then Bud had shouted: \"Come  ahead, kids, let's hoof it to Torrington!\" and in the twinkling of an  eye the tide had turned, the mob had shifted its allegiance and gone  tagging off at the heels of a new leader. They did not mean to have  their pleasure spoiled, not they!    Scornfully Stephen watched them mount the hill, their crimson sweaters  making a zigzag line of color in the sunshine; even their laughter,  care-free as if nothing had happened, floated back to him on the still  air, demonstrating how little concern they felt for him and his  refractory automobile. Well might they proceed light-heartedly to the  village, spend their money on sodas and ice-cream cones, and shout  themselves hoarse at the game. No thought of future punishment marred  their enjoyment and the program was precisely the one he had outlined  for himself before Fate had"]]]
