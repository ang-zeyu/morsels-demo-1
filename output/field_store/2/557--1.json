Those friends who have taken an interest in my literary productions  may feel some surprise at my appearance in the character of a  translator of Sanscrit poetry. To those, and indeed to all who may  take up the present volume, I owe some explanation of my pretensions  as a faithful interpreter of my original text. Those pretensions are  very humble; and I can unfeignedly say, that if the field had been  likely to be occupied by others, who might unite poetical powers with  a profound knowledge of the sacred language of India, I should have  withdrawn at once from the competition. But, in fact, in this country  the students of oriental literature, endowed with a taste and feeling  for poetry, are so few in number, that any attempt to make known the  peculiar character of those remarkable works, the old mythological  epics of India, may be received with indulgence by all who are  interested in the history of poetry. Mr. Wilson alone, since Sir W.  Jones, has united a poetical genius with deep Sanscrit scholarship;  but he has in general preferred the later and more polished  period--that of Kalidasa and the dramatists--to the ruder, yet in my  opinion, not less curious and poetical strains of the older epic  bards.    A brief account of the manner in which I became engaged in these  studies, will best explain the extent of my proficiency. During the  two last years in which I held the office of Professor of Poetry in  the University of Oxford, having exhausted the subject which I had  chosen for my terminal course, I was at a loss for some materials for  the few remaining lectures before my office should expire. I had been  led by the ardent curiosity, which I have ever felt to acquire some  knowledge of the poetry of all ages and nations--to examine some of  the publications of French and German, as well as English scholars, on  the subject of Indian poetry; chiefly those of the Schlegels, of Bopp,  and of De Chezy. I was struck with the singularity and captivated by  the extreme beauty, as it appeared to me, of some of the extracts,  especially those from the great epic poems, the Mahabharata and the  Ramayana, in their Homeric simplicity so totally opposite to the  ordinary notions entertained of all eastern poetry. I was induced to  attempt, without any instruction, and with the few elementary works  which could be procured, the Grammars of Wilkins and Bopp, the  Glossaries of Bopp and Rosen (Mr. Wilson's Dictionary was then out of  print and could not be purchased), to obtain some knowledge of this  wonderful and mysterious language. The study grew upon me, and would  have been pursued with more ardour, perhaps with more success, but for  the constant interruption of more imperative professional and literary  avocations. In itself the Sanscrit is an inexhaustible subject of  interest; in its grammatical structure more regular, artificial, and  copious than the most perfect of the western languages; in its origin,  the parent from which the older Greek, the Latin and the Teutonic  tongues seem to branch out and develop themselves upon distinct and  discernible principles.    I ventured to communicate to the Members of the University who  attended my lectures, my discoveries, as it were, in the unknown  region of Indian poetry, and to introduce translations of such  passages as appeared to me of peculiar singularity or beauty. Though I  was still moving in the leading-strings of my learned guides, I had  obtained sufficient acquaintance with the language to compare their  interpretations with the original text. I afterwards embodied some  parts of my lectures in an article in the Quarterly Review, in order  to contribute as far as was in my power to open this new and almost  untrodden field of literature to the English reader.    Still I should not have presumed to form these translations into a  separate work, nor acceded to the proposal of the publisher of the  present volume, who has himself deserved so well of the students of  oriental lore by his excellent translation, or rather recomposition of  Adelung's \"Historical Sketch of Sanscrit Literature,\" but for the  encouragement and assistance of Mr. Wilson, now, the University may be  proud to say, the Boden Professor of Sanscrit at Oxford. To his most  friendly care in revising these sheets, I owe the correction of many  errors; and Sanscrit scholars will find in the notes some observations  on the text, which will contribute to elucidate the poem of Nala.  Under the sanction of Mr. Wilson's revision, I may venture to hope  that the translation is, at least, an accurate version of the  original; and I cannot too strongly express my gratitude for the  labour which Mr. Wilson has been so kind as to expend on my imperfect  and unpretending work.    The versification, or rather the metrical system, which I have  adopted, is an experiment, how far a successful one must be judged by  others. The original verse in which the vast epics of Vyasa and  Valmiki are composed is called the Sloka, which is thus described by  Schlegel in his Indische Bibliothek, p. 36: \"The oldest, most simple,  and most generally adopted measure is the Sloka; a distich of two  sixteen syllable-lines, divided at the eighth syllable.\" According to  our prosodial marks, the following is the scheme:--    u u u u | u - - - | u u u u | u - u -  - - - - |       u | - - - - |       u    u u u u | u - - - | u u u u | u - u u  - - - - | -     u | - - - - |       -    The first four syllables are bound by no rule; the second half, on the  contrary, is unalterably fixed, excepting that the last syllable has  the common licence of termination. In the second half verse, I do not  remember a single instance of deviation from this, though sometimes,  but very seldom, the first half verse ends with another quadrisyllable  foot. The reader who is curious on the subject, may compare Mr.  Colebrooke's elaborate essays on Sanscrit poetry, Kosegarten's preface  to his Translation of Nala, and Bopp's preface to his Translation of  Selections from the Mahabharata.    In the first translations which I attempted, a few passages from the  Bhagavat-Gita, I adhered as nearly as possible to the measure of the  original; in the Nala, in order to give the narrative a more easy and  trochaic flow, I omitted one syllable, and in some degree changed the  structure of the verse.    _July_ 1835.          NALA AND DAMAYANTI.      The episode of Nala is extracted from the Vanaparvam, the third part  of the Mahabharata, the great Indian poem, which contains 100,000  slokas, or distichs. The sage, Vrihadasva, relates the story of Nala  to king Yudishthira, in order to console him under the miseries to  which he was exposed by bad success in play. By the terms of the  gaming transaction, in which he was worsted by Sakuni, who threw the  dice for Duryodhana, he was condemned to wander with his brothers for  twelve years in the forest. The adventures of Nala showed how that  king, having been in the same manner unfortunate with the dice, had  suffered still greater toil and misery, and had at length recovered  his kingdom and his wife. The popularity of this fable with the  natives, is sufficiently proved by the numerous poetic versions of the  story. The Nalodaya, a poem ascribed to Kalidas, should first be  mentioned. A new edition of this work has been recently published by  Ferdinand Benary; we have a notice of it in the Quarterly Review: it  seems to bear the same relation to the simple and national episode of  the Mahabharata, as the seicentesti of Italy to Dante or Ariosto, or  Gongora to the poem of the Cid. Another poem called Naishadha, in  twenty-two books, does not complete the story, but only carries it as  far as the fifteenth book. There is a Tamulic version of the same  story, translated by Kindersley, in his specimens of Hindu Literature.  The third book of the poem of Sriharsha, containing 135 slokas, is  entirely occupied with the conversation between Damayanti and the  swans (the geese), in which the birds to excite her love, dwell with  diffuse eloquence on the praises of Nala.

He peeps out of your coffee cup in the morning.    He cheers you upon a cold day in winter.    But the boys and girls were not so well acquainted with him a  hundred years ago.    About that long ago, far to the north and east, a queer boy lived.    He sat in his grandmother's kitchen many an hour, watching the  tea-kettle.    He seemed to be idle.    But he was really very busy.    He was talking very earnestly to the giant.    The giant was a prisoner.    No one knew how to free him.    Many had often tried to do this and failed.    He was almost always invisible.    But when he did appear, it was in the form of a very old man.    This old man had long, white hair, and a beard which seemed to  enwrap him like a cloak--a cloak as white as snow.    So his name is The White Giant.    The boy's name was James Watt.    He lived in far-away Scotland.    He sat long, listening to the White Giant as he told him many  wonderful things.    The way in which the giant first showed himself to James was very  strange.    James noticed that the lid of the tea-kettle was acting very  strangely.    It rose and fell, fluttered and danced.    Now, James had lived all his life among people who believed in  witches and fairies.    So he was watching for them.    And he thought there was somebody in the kettle trying to get out.    So he said, \"Who are you and what do you want?\"    \"Space, freedom, and something to do,\" cried the giant.    \"If you will only let me out, I'll work hard for you.    I'll draw your carriages and ships.    I'll lift all your weights.    I'll turn all the wheels of your factories.    I'll be your servant always, in a thousand other ways.\"      [Illustration: JOHN FITCH'S STEAMBOAT, 1788.    By permission of Providence & Stonington Steamship Co.]    If you have now guessed the common name of this giant, we will call  him Steam.    At the time James Watt lived, there were no steam boats, steam  mills, nor railways.    And this boy, though his grandmother scolded, thought much about the  giant in the tea-kettle.    And he became the inventor of the first steam engine that was of any  use to the world.    So, little by little, people came to know that steam is a great,  good giant.    They tried in many different ways to make him useful.    They wished very much to make him run a boat.    One man tried to run his boat in a queer way.    He made something like a duck's foot to push it through the water.    Another moved his boat by forcing a stream of water in at the bow  and out at the stern.    Then came a man named John Fitch.    He made his engine run a number of oars so as to paddle the boat  forward.    He grew very poor.    People laughed at him.    But he said, \"When I shall be forgotten, steam boats will run up the  rivers and across the seas.\"    Then people laughed the harder and called him \"a crank.\"    Mr. Fitch's boat was tried in 1787.    Now, in 1765, there happened a good thing for this old world.    A little baby boy was born in that year.    Perhaps you wonder why it was such a good thing for the world.    Some of you will know why when you read that this baby's name was  Robert Fulton.    His father was poor.    His father was a farmer in Pennsylvania.    Mr. Fulton had two little girls older than baby Robert.    When Robert was grown larger he had three sisters and one brother.    But their father died when they were all small.    Robert did not go to school till he was eight years old.    His mother taught him at home.    He knew how to read and write, and a very little arithmetic.    His first teacher was a Mr. Johnson.    Mr. Johnson was a Quaker.    He thought Robert a dull pupil.    Robert did not learn his lessons very well.    But Mr. Johnson soon found that he was never idle.    He did not care to play at recess.    He stayed in and used his pencil in drawing.    He often spent hours in this way.    Robert soon became fond of going into the machine shops.    He understood machinery very quickly.    The men always gave him a welcome.    He didn't get into mischief.    He often helped the men with his neat drawings.    One day Robert was late in getting to school.    The master asked the reason.    Robert answered that he had been in Mr. Miller's shop pounding out  lead for a lead pencil.    Mr. Johnson then encouraged him in doing such useful things.    In a few days, all the pupils in the school had pencils made in that  way.    Mr. Johnson urged Robert to give more attention to his studies.    Robert said, \"My head is so full of thoughts of my own that I  haven't room there for the thoughts from dusty books.\"    As he was not idle, no doubt this was true.    When Robert was thirteen, the boys in the town had a great  disappointment.    It was nearly July.    Of course the boys expected to celebrate the Fourth.    But a notice was put up.    This notice urged the people not to illuminate their homes.    It was very warm weather.    The people then had only candles with which to light their homes.    Candles were very scarce.    But Robert had some.    He took them to a shop and exchanged them for powder.    The owner of the store asked him why he gave up the candles, which  were so scarce and dear.    Robert said, \"I am a good citizen, and if our officers do not wish  us to illuminate the town, I shall respect their wishes.\"    He found some pieces of paste-board.    He rolled these himself.    In this way he made some rockets.    The store-keeper told him he would find it impossible to do this.    \"No, sir,\" Robert answered, \"there is nothing impossible.\"    His rockets were a success, and the people were astonished.    Robert bought at different times small quantities of quicksilver.    The men in the machine shops were curious to know what he did with  it.    But they could not find out.    For this reason they called him \"Quicksilver Bob.\"    Robert was interested in guns.    Sometimes he would tell the workmen how to improve them.    The men liked him so well that they were always willing to try  whatever he advised.    Robert was fond of fishing.    One of the workmen often went fishing with his father.    This man sometimes took Robert.    They had only an old flat boat.    The boys had to pole the boat from place to place.    It was hard work.    They were sometimes very tired.    Robert, soon after one fishing excursion, went away to visit an  aunt.    He was gone a week.    While away he made a complete model of a little fishing boat.    This boat had paddle wheels.    The model was placed in the garret.    Many years afterward his aunt was proud to have it as an ornament on  her parlor table.    Of course the boys arranged a set of paddle wheels for their fishing  boat.    After this they enjoyed their fishing much more than before.    Robert Fulton's boyhood was during the Revolutionary War.    He made many queer pictures of the Hessian soldiers.    These Hessians were Germans, who had been hired by the British to  help them fight the Americans.    The people who wished our country to belong to England were called  Tories.    Those who wished America to be free were called Whigs.    The Whig boys often fought the Tory boys on the soldiers' camp  ground.    The soldiers grew tired of this.    They stretched a rope to keep the boys out.    Robert drew a picture in which the Whigs crossed the rope and  whipped the Tories.    The boys all thought it a good picture.    So they tried to make it real.    They became so troublesome that the town officers had to interfere.    But Robert was all this time fast growing up.    He had to choose some way of taking care of himself.    He was more fond of his pencil and brush than of anything else.    Near his home, had lived a celebrated painter."]]]
