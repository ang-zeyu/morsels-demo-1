Astor Place, New York          PREFACE      Although it is now a century since Lamarck published the germs of his  theory, it is perhaps only within the past fifty years that the  scientific world and the general public have become familiar with the  name of Lamarck and of Lamarckism.    The rise and rehabilitation of the Lamarckian theory of organic  evolution, so that it has become a rival of Darwinism; the prevalence of  these views in the United States, Germany, England, and especially in  France, where its author is justly regarded as the real founder of  organic evolution, has invested his name with a new interest, and led to  a desire to learn some of the details of his life and work, and of his  theory as he unfolded it in 1800 and subsequent years, and finally  expounded it in 1809. The time seems ripe, therefore, for a more  extended sketch of Lamarck and his theory, as well as of his work as a  philosophical biologist, than has yet appeared.    But the seeker after the details of his life is baffled by the general  ignorance about the man--his antecedents, his parentage, the date of his  birth, his early training and education, his work as a professor in the  Jardin des Plantes, the house he lived in, the place of his burial, and  his relations to his scientific contemporaries.    Except the _eloges_ of Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier, and the brief  notices of Martins, Duval, Bourguignat, and Bourguin, there is no  special biography, however brief, except a _brochure_ of thirty-one  pages, reprinted from a few scattered articles by the distinguished  anthropologist, M. Gabriel de Mortillet, in the fourth and last volume  of a little-known journal, _l'Homme_, entitled _Lamarck. Par un Groupe  de Transformistes, ses Disciples_, Paris, 1887. This exceedingly rare  pamphlet was written by the late M. Gabriel de Mortillet, with the  assistance of Philippe Salmon and Dr. A. Mondiere, who with others,  under the leadership of Paul Nicole, met in 1884 and formed a _Reunion  Lamarck_ and a _Diner Lamarck_, to maintain and perpetuate the memory of  the great French transformist. Owing to their efforts, the exact date of  Lamarck's birth, the house in which he lived during his lifetime at  Paris, and all that we shall ever know of his place of burial have been  established. It is a lasting shame that his remains were not laid in a  grave, but were allowed to be put into a trench, with no headstone to  mark the site, on one side of a row of graves of others better cared  for, from which trench his bones, with those of others unknown and  neglected, were exhumed and thrown into the catacombs of Paris. Lamarck  left behind him no letters or manuscripts; nothing could be ascertained  regarding the dates of his marriages, the names of his wives or of all  his children. Of his descendants but one is known to be living, an  officer in the army. But his aims in life, his undying love of science,  his noble character and generous disposition are constantly revealed in  his writings.    The name of Lamarck has been familiar to me from my youth up. When a  boy, I used to arrange my collection of shells by the Lamarckian system,  which had replaced the old Linnean classification. For over thirty years  the Lamarckian factors of evolution have seemed to me to afford the  foundation on which natural selection rests, to be the primary and  efficient causes of organic change, and thus to account for the origin  of variations, which Darwin himself assumed as the starting point or  basis of his selection theory. It is not lessening the value of Darwin's  labors, to recognize the originality of Lamarck's views, the vigor with  which he asserted their truth, and the heroic manner in which, against  adverse and contemptuous criticism, to his dying day he clung to them.    During a residence in Paris in the spring and summer of 1899, I spent my  leisure hours in gathering material for this biography. I visited the  place of his birth--the little hamlet of Bazentin, near Amiens--and,  thanks to the kindness of the schoolmaster of that village, M. Duval,  was shown the house where Lamarck was born, the records in the old  parish register at the _mairie_ of the birth of the father of Lamarck  and of Lamarck himself. The Jesuit Seminary at Amiens was also visited,  in order to obtain traces of his student life there, though the search  was unsuccessful.    My thanks are due to Professor A. Giard of Paris for kind assistance in  the loan of rare books, for copies of his own essays, especially his  _Lecon d'Ouverture des Cours de l'Evolution des Etres organises_, 1888,  and in facilitating the work of collecting data. Introduced by him to  Professor Hamy, the learned anthropologist and archivist of the Museum  d'Histoire Naturelle, I was given by him the freest access to the  archives in the Maison de Buffon, which, among other papers, contained  the MS. _Archives du Museum_; _i.e._, the _Proces verbaux des Seances  tenues par les Officiers du Jardin des Plantes_, from 1790 to 1830,  bound in vellum, in thirty-four volumes. These were all looked through,  though found to contain but little of biographical interest relating to  Lamarck, beyond proving that he lived in that ancient edifice from 1793  until his death in 1829. Dr. Hamy's elaborate history of the last years  of the Royal Garden and of the foundation of the Museum d'Histoire  Naturelle, in the volume commemorating the centennial of the foundation  of the Museum, has been of essential service.    My warmest thanks are due to M. Adrien de Mortillet, formerly secretary  of the Society of Anthropology of Paris, for most essential aid. He  kindly gave me a copy of a very rare pamphlet, entitled _Lamarck. Par un  Groupe de Transformistes, ses Disciples_. He also referred me to notices  bearing on the genealogy of Lamarck and his family in the _Revue de  Gascogne_ for 1876. To him also I am indebted for the privilege of  having electrotypes made of the five illustrations in the _Lamarck_, for  copies of the composite portrait of Lamarck by Dr. Gachet, and also for  a photograph of the _Acte de Naissance_ reproduced by the late  M. Salmon.    I have also to acknowledge the kindness shown me by Dr. J. Deniker, the  librarian of the Bibliotheque du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle.    I had begun in the museum library, which contains nearly if not every  one of Lamarck's publications, to prepare a bibliography of all of  Lamarck's writings, when, to my surprise and pleasure, I was presented  with a very full and elaborate one by the assistant-librarian,  M. Godefroy Malloisel.    To Professor Edmond Perrier I am indebted for a copy of his valuable  _Lamarck et le Transformisme Actuel_, reprinted from the noble volume  commemorative of the centennial of the foundation of the Museum  d'Histoire Naturelle, which has proved of much use.    Other sources from which biographical details have been taken are  Cuvier's _eloge_, and the notice of Lamarck, with a list of many of his  writings, in the _Revue biographique de la Societe malacologique de  France_, 1886. This notice, which is illustrated by three portraits of  Lamarck, one of which has been reproduced, I was informed by M. Paul  Kleinsieck was prepared by the late J. R. Bourguignat, the eminent  malacologist and anthropologist. The notices by Professor Mathias Duval  and by L. A. Bourguin have been of essential service.    As regards the account of Lamarck's speculative and theoretical views, I  have, so far as possible, preferred, by abstracts and translations, to  let him tell his own story, rather than to comment at much length myself  on points about which the ablest thinkers and students differ so much.    It is hoped that Lamarck's writings referring to the evolution theory  may, at no distant date, be reprinted in the original, as they are not  bulky and could be comprised in a single volume.    This life is offered with much diffidence, though the pleasure of  collecting the materials and of putting them together has been very  great.        BROWN UNIVERSITY, PROVIDENCE, R.

He was born sixty-two years ago on the Illinois prairie, and he has  devoted practically all of his life to the pursuit of wild animals. It  has been a pursuit which owed its unflagging energy and indomitable  purpose to a singular passion, almost an obsession, to capture alive,  not to kill. He has caught and broken the will of every well-known wild  beast native to western North America. Killing was repulsive to him. He  even disliked the sight of a sporting rifle, though for years necessity  compelled him to earn his livelihood by supplying the meat of buffalo  to the caravans crossing the plains. At last, seeing that the  extinction of the noble beasts was inevitable, he smashed his rifle  over a wagon wheel and vowed to save the species. For ten years he  labored, pursuing, capturing and taming buffalo, for which the West  gave him fame, and the name Preserver of the American Bison.    As civilization encroached upon the plains Buffalo Jones ranged slowly  westward; and to-day an isolated desert-bound plateau on the north rim  of the Grand Canyon of Arizona is his home. There his buffalo browse  with the mustang and deer, and are as free as ever they were on the  rolling plains.    In the spring of 1907 I was the fortunate companion of the old  plainsman on a trip across the desert, and a hunt in that wonderful  country of yellow crags, deep canyons and giant pines. I want to tell  about it. I want to show the color and beauty of those painted cliffs  and the long, brown-matted bluebell-dotted aisles in the grand forests;  I want to give a suggestion of the tang of the dry, cool air; and  particularly I want to throw a little light upon the life and nature of  that strange character and remarkable man, Buffalo Jones.    Happily in remembrance a writer can live over his experiences, and see  once more the moonblanched silver mountain peaks against the dark blue  sky; hear the lonely sough of the night wind through the pines; feel  the dance of wild expectation in the quivering pulse; the stir, the  thrill, the joy of hard action in perilous moments; the mystery of  man's yearning for the unattainable.    As a boy I read of Boone with a throbbing heart, and the silent  moccasined, vengeful Wetzel I loved.    I pored over the deeds of later men--Custer and Carson, those heroes of  the plains. And as a man I came to see the wonder, the tragedy of their  lives, and to write about them. It has been my destiny--what a happy  fulfillment of my dreams of border spirit!--to live for a while in the  fast-fading wild environment which produced these great men with the  last of the great plainsmen.

CONCLUSION          CHAPTER 1.    THE ARIZONA DESERT    One afternoon, far out on the sun-baked waste of sage, we made camp  near a clump of withered pinyon trees. The cold desert wind came down  upon us with the sudden darkness. Even the Mormons, who were finding  the trail for us across the drifting sands, forgot to sing and pray at  sundown. We huddled round the campfire, a tired and silent little  group. When out of the lonely, melancholy night some wandering Navajos  stole like shadows to our fire, we hailed their advent with delight.  They were good-natured Indians, willing to barter a blanket or  bracelet; and one of them, a tall, gaunt fellow, with the bearing of a  chief, could speak a little English.    \"How,\" said he, in a deep chest voice.    \"Hello, Noddlecoddy,\" greeted Jim Emmett, the Mormon guide.    \"Ugh!\" answered the Indian.    \"Big paleface--Buffalo Jones---big chief--buffalo man,\" introduced  Emmett, indicating Jones.    \"How.\" The Navajo spoke with dignity, and extended a friendly hand.    \"Jones big white chief--rope buffalo--tie up tight,\" continued Emmett,  making motions with his arm, as if he were whirling a lasso.    \"No big--heap small buffalo,\" said the Indian, holding his hand level  with his knee, and smiling broadly.    Jones, erect, rugged, brawny, stood in the full light of the campfire.  He had a dark, bronzed, inscrutable face; a stern mouth and square jaw,  keen eyes, half-closed from years of searching the wide plains; and  deep furrows wrinkling his cheeks. A strange stillness enfolded his  feature the tranquility earned from a long life of adventure.    He held up both muscular hands to the Navajo, and spread out his  fingers.    \"Rope buffalo--heap big buffalo--heap many--one sun.\"    The Indian straightened up, but kept his friendly smile.    \"Me big chief,\" went on Jones, \"me go far north--Land of Little  Sticks--Naza! Naza! rope musk-ox; rope White Manitou of Great Slave  Naza! Naza!\"    \"Naza!\" replied the Navajo, pointing to the North Star; \"no--no.\"    \"Yes me big paleface--me come long way toward setting sun--go cross Big  Water--go Buckskin--Siwash--chase cougar.\"    The cougar, or mountain lion, is a Navajo god and the Navajos hold him  in as much fear and reverence as do the Great Slave Indians the musk-ox.    \"No kill cougar,\" continued Jones, as the Indian's bold features  hardened. \"Run cougar horseback--run long way--dogs chase cougar long  time--chase cougar up tree! Me big chief--me climb tree--climb high  up--lasso cougar--rope cougar--tie cougar all tight.\"    The Navajo's solemn face relaxed    \"White man heap fun. No.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Jones, extending his great arms. \"Me strong; me rope  cougar--me tie cougar; ride off wigwam, keep cougar alive.\"    \"No,\" replied the savage vehemently.    \"Yes,\" protested Jones, nodding earnestly.    \"No,\" answered the Navajo, louder, raising his dark head.    \"Yes!\" shouted Jones.    \"BIG LIE!\" the Indian thundered.    Jones joined good-naturedly in the laugh at his expense. The Indian had  crudely voiced a skepticism I had heard more delicately hinted in New  York, and singularly enough, which had strengthened on our way West, as  we met ranchers, prospectors and cowboys. But those few men I had  fortunately met, who really knew Jones, more than overbalanced the  doubt and ridicule cast upon him. I recalled a scarred old veteran of  the plains, who had talked to me in true Western bluntness:    \"Say, young feller, I heerd yer couldn't git acrost the Canyon fer the  deep snow on the north rim. Wal, ye're lucky. Now, yer hit the trail  fer New York, an' keep goin'! Don't ever tackle the desert, 'specially  with them Mormons. They've got water on the brain, wusser 'n religion.  It's two hundred an' fifty miles from Flagstaff to Jones range, an'  only two drinks on the trail. I know this hyar Buffalo Jones. I knowed  him way back in the seventies, when he was doin' them ropin' stunts  thet made him famous as the preserver of the American bison. I know  about that crazy trip of his'n to the Barren Lands, after musk-ox. An'  I reckon I kin guess what he'll do over there in the Siwash. He'll rope  cougars--sure he will--an' watch 'em jump. Jones would rope the devil,  an' tie him down if the lasso didn't burn. Oh! he's hell on ropin'  things. An' he's wusser 'n hell on men, an' hosses, an' dogs.\"    All that my well-meaning friend suggested made me, of course, only the  more eager to go with Jones. Where I had once been interested in the  old buffalo hunter, I was now fascinated. And now I was with him in the  desert and seeing him as he was, a simple, quiet man, who fitted the  mountains and the silences, and the long reaches of distance.    \"It does seem hard to believe--all this about Jones,\" remarked Judd,  one of Emmett's men.    \"How could a man have the strength and the nerve? And isn't it cruel to  keep wild animals in captivity? it against God's word?\"    Quick as speech could flow, Jones quoted: \"And God said, 'Let us make  man in our image, and give him dominion over the fish of the sea, the  fowls of the air, over all the cattle, and over every creeping thing  that creepeth upon the earth'!\"    \"Dominion--over all the beasts of the field!\" repeated Jones, his big  voice rolling out. He clenched his huge fists, and spread wide his long  arms. \"Dominion! That was God's word!\" The power and intensity of him  could be felt. Then he relaxed, dropped his arms, and once more grew  calm. But he had shown a glimpse of the great, strange and absorbing  passion of his life. Once he had told me how, when a mere child, he had  hazarded limb and neck to capture a fox squirrel, how he had held on to  the vicious little animal, though it bit his hand through; how he had  never learned to play the games of boyhood; that when the youths of the  little Illinois village were at play, he roamed the prairies, or the  rolling, wooded hills, or watched a gopher hole. That boy was father of  the man: for sixty years an enduring passion for dominion over wild  animals had possessed him, and made his life an endless pursuit.    Our guests, the Navajos, departed early, and vanished silently in the  gloom of the desert. We settled down again into a quiet that was broken  only by the low chant-like song of a praying Mormon. Suddenly the  hounds bristled, and old Moze, a surly and aggressive dog, rose and  barked at some real or imaginary desert prowler. A sharp command from  Jones made Moze crouch down, and the other hounds cowered close  together.    \"Better tie up the dogs,\" suggested Jones. \"Like as not coyotes run  down here from the hills.\"    The hounds were my especial delight. But Jones regarded them with  considerable contempt. When all"]]]
