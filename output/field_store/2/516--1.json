Miles      Published by T. Fisher Unwin    1912      [Illustration:    THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI (DETAIL).    GENTILE DA FABRIANO    (_Florence: Accademia_)]    |5|          PREFACE      In this volume I have tried to show how Christmas is or has been kept in  various lands and ages, and to trace as far as possible the origin of the  pagan elements that have mingled with the Church's feast of the Nativity.    In Part I. I have dealt with the festival on its distinctively Christian  side. The book has, however, been so planned that readers not interested  in this aspect of Christmas may pass over Chapters II.-V., and proceed at  once from the Introduction to Part II., which treats of pagan survivals.    The book has been written primarily for the general reader, but I venture  to hope that, with all its imperfections, it may be of some use to the  more serious student, as a rough outline map of the field of Christmas  customs, and as bringing together materials hitherto scattered through a  multitude of volumes in various languages. There is certainly room for a  comprehensive English book on Christmas, taking account of the results of  modern historical and folk-lore research.    The writer of a work of this kind necessarily owes an immense debt to the  labours of others. In my bibliographical notes I have done my best to  acknowledge the sources from which I have drawn. It is only right that  I should express here my special obligation, both for information and for  suggestions, to Mr. E. K. Chambers's \"The Mediaeval Stage,\" an invaluable  storehouse of fact, theory, and bibliographical references. I also owe  much to the important monographs of Dr. A. Tille, \"Die Geschichte der  deutschen Weihnacht\" and \"Yule and Christmas\"; to Dr. Feilberg's Danish  work, \"Jul,\" the fullest account of Christmas |6|  customs yet written;  and of course, like every student of folk-lore, to Dr. Frazer's \"The  Golden Bough.\"    References to authorities will be found at the end of the volume, and are  indicated by small numerals in the text; notes requiring to be read in  close conjunction with the text are printed at the foot of the pages to  which they relate, and are indicated by asterisks, &c.       [Transcriber's Note: The 'small numerals' are represented in this     ebook by numbers in {curly braces}. The footnotes appear at the end     of the ebook and are indicated by numbers in [square brackets].

WEEKES _R.P._        _Episc. Lond. Cap._          _Domest._      [Decoration]          To the Reader.      _If amongst thy leisure houres thou canst spare any for the perusall of  this discourse, and dost looke to finde somewhat in it which may serve  for thy information and benefit: let me then advise thee to come unto  it with an equall minde, not swayed by prejudice, but indifferently  resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme  most probable unto thy reason, and then I doubt not, but either thou  wilt agree with mee in this assertion, or at least not thinke it to be  as farre from truth, as it is from common opinion._    _Two cautions there are which I would willingly admonish thee of in the  beginning._    1. _That thou shouldst not here looke to find any exact, accurate     Treatise, since this discourse was but the fruit of some lighter     studies, and those too hudled up in a short time, being first     thought of and finished in the space of some few weekes, and     therefore you cannot in reason expect, that it should be so     polished, as perhaps, the subject would require, or the leisure     of the Author might have done it._    2. _To remember that I promise onely probable arguments for the     proofe of this opinion, and therefore you must not looke that every     consequence should be of an undeniable dependance, or that the truth     of each argument should be measured by its necessity. I grant that     some Astronomicall appearances may possibly be solved otherwise then     here they are. But the thing I aime at is this, that probably they     may so be solved, as I have here set them downe: Which, if it be     granted (as I thinke it must) then I doubt not, but the indifferent     reader will find some satisfaction in the maine thing that is to be     proved._    _Many ancient Philosophers of the better note, have formerly defended  this assertion, which I have here laid downe, and it were to be wished,  that some of us would more apply our endeavours unto the examination of  these old opinions, which though they have for a long time lien  neglected by others, yet in them may you finde many truths well worthy  your paines and observation. Tis a false conceit, for us to thinke, that  amongst the ancient variety and search of opinions, the best hath still  prevailed. Time (saith the learned _Verulam_) seemes to be of the nature  of a river or streame, which carrieth downe to us that which is light,  or blowne up, but sinketh that which is weighty and solid._    _It is my desire that by the occasion of this discourse, I may raise up  some more active spirit to a search after other hidden and unknowne  truthes. Since it must needes be a great impediment unto the growth of  sciences, for men still so to plod on upon beaten principles, as to be  afraid of entertaining any thing that may seeme to contradict them. An  unwillingnesse to take such things into examination, is one of those  errours of learning in these times observed by the judicious _Verulam_.  Questionlesse there are many secret truths, which the ancients have  passed over, that are yet left to make some of our age famous for their  discovery._    _If by this occasion I may provoke any reader to an attempt of this  nature, I shall then thinke my selfe happy, and this work successefull._    Farewell.            [Decoration]      The First Proposition, by way of Preface.    _That the strangenesse of this opinion is no sufficient reason why it    should be rejected, because other certaine truths have beene formerly    esteemed ridiculous, and great absurdities entertayned by common    consent._      There is an earnestnesse and hungering after novelty, which doth still  adhere unto all our natures, and it is part of that primative image,  that wide extent and infinite capacity at first created in the heart of  man, for this since its depravation in _Adam_ perceiving it selfe  altogether emptied of any good doth now catch after every new thing,  conceiving that possibly it may finde satisfaction among some of its  fellow creatures. But our enemy the divell (who strives still to pervert  our gifts, and beate us with our owne weapons) hath so contriv'd it,  that any truth doth now seeme distastefull for that very reason, for  which errour is entertain'd--Novelty, for let but some upstart heresie  be set abroach, and presently there are some out of a curious humour;  others, as if they watched an occasion of singularity, will take it up  for canonicall, and make it part of their creede and profession; whereas  solitary truth cannot any where finde so ready entertainement; but the  same Novelty which is esteemed the commendation of errour and makes that  acceptable, is counted the fault of truth, and causes that to bee  rejected. How did the incredulous World gaze at _Columbus_ when hee  promised to discover another part of the earth, and he could not for a  long time by his confidence, or arguments, induce any of the Christian  Princes, either to assent unto his opinion, or goe to the charges of an  experiment. Now if he who had such good grounds for his assertion, could  finde no better entertainement among the wiser sort, and upper end of  the World; 'tis not likely then that this opinion which I now deliver,  shall receive any thing from the men of these daies, especially our  vulgar wits, but misbeliefe or derision. It hath alwaies beene the  unhappinesse of new truths in Philosophy, to be derided by those that  are ignorant of the causes of things, and reiected by others whose  perversenesse ties them to the contrary opinion, men whose envious pride  will not allow any new thing for truth which they themselves were not  the first inventors of. So that I may iustly expect to be accused of a  pragmaticall ignorance, and bold ostentation, especially since for this  opinion _Xenophanes_, a man whose authority was able to adde some credit  to his assertion could not escape the like censure from others. For  _Natales Comes_ speaking of that Philosopher,[1] and this his opinion,  saith thus,      _Nonnulli ne nihil scisse videantur, aliqua nova monstra in    Philosophia introducunt, ut alicujus rei inventores fuisse appareant._      \"Some there are who least they might seeme to know nothing, will    bring up monstrous absurdities in Philosophy, that so afterward they    may bee famed for the invention of somewhat.\"    The same author doth also in another place accuse _Anaxagoras_[2] of  folly for the same opinion,      _Est enim non ignobilis gradus stultitiae, vel si nescias quid dicas,    tamen velle de rebus propositis hanc vel illam partem stabilire._    \"'Tis none of the worst kindes of folly, boldly to affirme one side or  other, when a man knows not what to say.\"      [Sidenote 1: _Mytholog. lib. 3. c. 17._]      [Sidenote 2: _Lib. 7. c. 1._]    If these men were thus censur'd, I may iustly then expect to be derided  by most, and to be believed by few or none; especially since this  opinion seemes to carry in it so much strangenesse, so much  contradiction to the generall consent of others. But how ever, I am  resolved that this shall not be any discouragement, since I know that it  is not the common opinion of others that can either adde or detract from  the truth. For,    1. Other truths have beene formerly esteemed altogether as ridiculous     as this can be.    2. Grosse absurdities have beene entertained by generall opinion.    I shall give an instance of each, that so I may the better prepare the  Reader to consider things without a prejudice, when hee shall see that  the common opposition against this which I affirme cannot any way  derogate from its"]]]
