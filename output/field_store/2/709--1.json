CHAPTER I.    THE BANISHED BRITON.      [Sidenote: 1819]    In the afternoon of a warm and sultry day, towards the close of one of  the warmest and most sultry summers which Upper Canada has ever known,  an extraordinary trial took place at the court-house in the old town of  Niagara. The time was more than threescore years ago, when York was a  place of insignificant proportions; when Hamilton could barely be said  to have an existence; and when the sites of most of the other towns of  the Province whose names are now familiar to us still formed part of the  hunting-grounds of the native Indian. The little town on the frontier  was relatively a place of much greater importance than it is at present;  though its fortunes, even at that early period, were decidedly on the  wane, and such glory as it could ever boast of possessing, as the  Provincial capital, had departed from it long before. To speak with  absolute precision, the date was Friday, the 20th of August, 1819: so  long ago that, as far as I have been able to learn, there are only two  persons now living who were present on the occasion. The court-room,  which was the largest in the Province, was packed to the doors, and  though every window was thrown open for purposes of ventilation, the  atmosphere was almost stifling. Even a stranger, had any such been  present, could not have failed to perceive that the trial was one in  which a keen interest was felt by the spectators, many of whom were  restless and irritable, insomuch that they found it impossible to keep  perfectly still, and from time to time shifted uneasily in their places.  Whispers, \"not loud, but deep,\" occasionally reverberated from the back  benches to the quadrangular space in front assigned to gentlemen of the  long robe, and ascended thence to the august presence upon the judgment  seat. Ever and anon the stentorian voice of the crier proclaimed  silence, in a tone which plainly signified that endurance had well-nigh  reached its limits, and that he would really be compelled to proceed to  extremities if his mandate were any longer disobeyed.    The court-room was of the old conventional pattern. At the upper end was  the large elevated desk, or throne, extending nearly half way across the  chamber, with spacious cushioned chairs, and other suitable  accommodation for the presiding judge and his associates. To right and  left were the enclosed jury boxes, with seats raised considerably above  the level of the floor, but not so high as those provided for the  justices. Directly opposite the throne of justice, and about six yards  distant therefrom, was the prisoners' dock, into which five or six  persons might have been thrust, at a pinch. The intervening space  enclosed by this quadrangle--throne, prisoners' dock, and jury  boxes--was mainly appropriated to the use of barristers and attorneys,  and their clients. A large portion of the space so appropriated was  occupied by a table, around which were distributed a few chairs, every  one of which was occupied; and at the end directly below the judicial  throne was a small enclosure provided for the clerk of the court, set  apart by a low railing, and containing a desk of diminutive size.  Between the clerk's desk and the left-hand jury box was the witness  stall, raised to a level with the highest seats provided for the jurors.  A seat for the sheriff was placed a short distance to the right of the  throne of justice, and on a slightly lower level.    All these arrangements occupied perhaps one-third of the entire  court-room. The rest of the space, extending from the rear of the  prisoners' dock to the lower end of the chamber, was occupied by seats  rising tier behind tier, with a passage down the middle. Between each  of the ends of these seats and the walls of the chamber were passages of  about three feet in width, leading to the doors, for purposes of  \"ingress, egress and regress.\" Such was the plan of the conventional  Upper Canadian court-room in the olden time; and such, with a few  inconsiderable modifications, many of them remain down to the present  day.    The sole occupant of the judgment seat, on this sultry afternoon, was a  gentleman of somewhat diminutive size, but withal of handsome and  imposing appearance. Though he had reached advanced middle life, he  presented none of the signs of age, and evidently retained all his  vigour unimpaired. His eyes were bright and keen, and his small but firm  and clearly cut features were lighted up with the consciousness of  mental power. No one, looking upon that countenance, could doubt that  its owner had all his faculties under strict and thorough control, or  that his faculties were considerably above those of average humanity.  The face was not one for a child to fall in love with, for it was a  perfect index to the character, and was firm and strong rather than  amiable or kind. Evidently a man who, should the occasion for doing so  arise, would deal out the utmost rigour of the law, if not with  indifference, at least without a qualm. He was the Honourable William  Dummer Powell, and he occupied the high office of Chief Justice of the  Province. In conjunction with the Reverend Doctor Strachan, Rector of  York, he had for several years practically directed the administration  of affairs in Upper Canada. Francis Gore and Sir Peregrine Maitland  might successively posture as figure-heads under the title of  Lieutenant-Governors, but the real depositaries of power were the Rector  and the Chief Justice. Ominous combination! which falsified the aphorism  of a great writer--now, unhappily, lost to us--about the inevitable  incompatibility of law and gospel. Both of them had seats in the  Executive Council, and, under the then-existing state of things, were  official but irresponsible advisers of the Crown's representative. More  than one would-be innovator of those days had been made to feel the  weight of their hands, without in the least knowing, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Productions of this indefinite kind are apt to grow  in the hands of an author; and in the course of his revision he was  unable to resist the temptation to throw in a few additional touches  here and there, as to which he can only hope that they will not  deteriorate the volume in the eyes of those who thought well of it in  its old shape.    1863.

CHAPTER I.    ABERDEEN.    _Parentage--Patons--Grandholm--Jersey--\"Peninsular War\"--School and  schoolmasters--Flogging--College--Competition for bursaries--Home  life--Aunt and grand-aunt--Holiday rambles--Letter._      John Hill Burton, the subject of this notice, was born on the 22d of  August 1809, in the Gallowgate of Aberdeen. He was wont to style  himself, as in his childhood he had heard himself described, \"The last  of the Gallowgate bairns;\" the Gallowgate being an old part of Aberdeen  devoted chiefly to humble trade, no one, in modern times at least, even  distantly connected with gentility living there.    His father, William Kinninmont Burton, is believed to have been an only  son, and no kith or kin of his were ever seen or heard of by his  children. The only relic of their father's family possessed by them is a  somewhat interesting miniature on ivory, well painted in the  old-fashioned style, representing a not beautiful lady in antique  head-dress and costume, and marked on the back \"Mary Burton.\" William  Kinninmont Burton held a commission in the army, though he had not been  originally intended for a military life. He was, it is supposed, engaged  in trade in London when the military enthusiasm, excited by the idea of  an invasion of Great Britain by Napoleon, fired him, like so many other  young men, into taking up arms as a volunteer. In the end of last  century he came to Aberdeen as a lieutenant in a regiment of  \"Fencibles,\" or some such volunteer title, and there captivated the  affections of a beautiful young lady, Miss Eliza Paton, a daughter of  the laird of Grandholm, an estate four miles distant from Aberdeen. Of  this lady and of her family a few words must be said.    So small was the value of land in Scotland in the beginning of the  century, that it is safe to suppose the estate of Grandholm yielded less  than one-third of its present rental. The circumstances and social  position of the family were, besides, seriously lowered by the  extraordinary character of the then laird. John Paton, grandfather of  Dr Burton, was a man not devoid of talent, and of a strikingly handsome  gentlemanly appearance and manner. He married, early in life, a  beautiful Miss Lance, an Englishwoman, who, after bearing him ten  children in about as many years, fell into a weak state of health, of  mind as well as body. The laird nursed his wife devotedly for a long  period of years, cherishing her to the exclusion of all other persons or  interests. His children he regarded as the enemies of his adored wife,  and consequently of himself, and his conduct to them from first to last  was little less than brutal. When the enfeebled wife at last died, the  husband's grief verged on madness.    He would not allow her body to be buried in the ordinary manner, but  caused a tomb to be erected in a wood near the house of Grandholm, where  the corpse was placed in an open coffin, and where the bereaved husband  could go daily to bewail his loss. The distracted mourner rejected all  attentions from children, relatives, or friends, yet apparently dreaded  being left alone, for he advertised for a male companion or keeper to  bear him company. The writer has often heard Dr Burton amuse himself and  his audience by describing the extraordinary varieties of struggling  humanity who applied for the situation. Ultimately, it is believed, none  of them was selected, and the laird fled from his natural home, and from  that time till his death lived chiefly in London, leaving his large  young family to take care of themselves as they best could.    The three sons went successively to India or other foreign parts, and  died there, one of them leaving a son, whose family are the present  possessors of Grandholm.    Of the seven daughters--several of whom were very handsome--two only  were married, namely, Eliza, who became Mrs Burton, mother of the  historiographer; and Margaret, who espoused rather late in life a Dr  Brown, and continued as a widow to inhabit an old house belonging to the  Grandholm family in Old Aberdeen till June 1879, when she died at the  age of ninety-eight.    The young family, thus deserted by their natural protector, fell chiefly  under the authority of his eldest daughter, Mary--said, of all his  children, to most resemble the laird himself.    Among this lady's nephews and nieces there linger strange traditions of  the violence of her temper, and of the intensity of her loves and hates.  It is hardly necessary to say that none of the females at least of the  family received any particular education.    Mary was a woman of strong natural abilities, and of an excellent  business faculty. She managed the very small resources left at her  command with consummate skill, and in her later years made of Grandholm  a hospitable, cheerful, old-fashioned home for those whom it pleased her  to receive there. Her sister Eliza's marriage had not pleased her. There  was much to justify her objection to it; William Burton, not then  holding a commission, was entirely without pecuniary resources.    His strongest talent seems to have been for painting, and by such  occupation as he could get in drawing and painting in London he was  barely able to maintain himself. The old grandfather and his lieutenant,  aunt Mary, have been described to the writer in the darkest colours as  having constantly interposed between the true lovers, William Burton and  his beloved Eliza Paton, who, in spite of all advice to the contrary,  soon became his wife. What the laird of Grandholm and his daughter Mary  did was no doubt done in the harshest manner, but their actions  themselves seem hardly blamable.
