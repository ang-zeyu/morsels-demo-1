How early, and to what extent, colouring may have attained the rank of  science among the ancients, are questions not easily set at rest; but  that some progress had been made, even at a very remote period, is  proved by the magnificent tombs of the Egyptian kings at Thebes, where  the walls of the royal mausoleum are described as being covered with  paintings so fresh and perfect, as to require neither restoration nor  improvement. So far from this, indeed, that with all care in copying, it  was difficult to equal the brilliancy of the originals, which, as far as  colours went, threw all others in the background. And yet, in spite of  the scale having comprised pure vermilion, ochres, and indigo, it was  not gaudy, owing to the judicious balance of the colours, and the  artful management of the black. Nor was there an ornament throughout the  dresses, wherein the red, yellow, and blue, were not so employed as to  produce a delicious harmony.    Moreover, it is stated that in one painting eighty feet high and  proportionably broad, which was divided into two ranges of gigantic  figures, these were glowing with most exquisite colours, suited to the  drapery and naked parts; and in which the azure, yellow, green, &c.,  were as well preserved as though they had been laid on yesterday. Again,  an apartment was discovered among the stupendous ruins at Carnac, on the  site of ancient Thebes, one hundred paces wide and sixty deep,  completely crowded with pillars, which, together with the ceiling, roof,  and walls, were decorated with figures in basso-relievo, and  hieroglyphics--all marvellously beautiful and finely painted, and as  fresh, splendid and glorious, after so many ages, as if they had just  been finished.    In various accounts these colourings of the Egyptians are described in  the warmest terms of admiration. The most charming are undoubtedly those  on the tombs and temples: others of less merit have been found on the  cases and cloths of mummies, and on papyrus rolls; but it is to the  patterns on the walls and ceilings of their houses that they seem to  have been most partial, and paid the most attention. The ordinary  colours employed by them were red, yellow, green, and blue. Of the last  there were two tints; black also was common. For white, the finely  prepared stone-coloured ground was deemed sufficient. These colours were  occasionally modified by mixture with chalk; but were always, or nearly  always, applied singly, in an unmixed state. With regard to their  composition, chemical analysis has shown several of the _blues_ to be  oxide of copper with a small proportion of iron; none containing cobalt.  There is little doubt, however, that the most brilliant specimens--those  which retain all their original force and beauty in the temples of Upper  Egypt after an exposure of three thousand years, consist of  ultramarine--the celebrated Armenian blue, possibly, of the ancients.  The _reds_ seem for the most part to be composed of oxide of iron mixed  with lime, and were probably limited to iron earths and ochres, with a  native cinnabar or vermilion. The _yellows_ are said to have been, in  many cases, vegetable colours; but it is likely earths and ochres were  their chief source. The _greens_ consist of yellow mixed with copper  blue. The bluish-green which sometimes appears on Egyptian antiquities,  is merely a faded blue. The _blacks_ are both of vegetable and mineral  origin, having been obtained from a variety of substances in a variety  of ways.    But, as shown by Layard in his discoveries at Nineveh, a knowledge of  colouring was not confined to the Egyptians; it was likewise possessed  by the Assyrians. The painted ornaments of the latter are stated to have  been remarkably elegant; and although the colours were limited to blue,  red, white, yellow, and black, yet they were arranged with so much taste  and skill, and the contrasts were so judiciously preserved, that the  combinations were in general agreeable to the eye. The pale  yellowish-white ground on which the designs were painted, resembled the  tint on the walls of Egyptian monuments, and a strong well-defined black  outline was found to be as peculiar a feature in Assyrian as in Egyptian  painting, black frequently combining with white alone, or alternating  with other colours. As far as they have been analysed, the pigments  employed were mineral, the brightest being a blue derived from copper.  No traces of vegetable colours have been found; it is presumed that they  existed, but being subject to more rapid decay than the mineral  pigments, they have disappeared. That all the colours, indeed, employed  by the ancients were not permanent, was proved by the fact of certain  blues and reds, brilliant and vivid when the earth was removed from  them, fading rapidly when exposed to the air.    From Philocles, the Egyptian, and Gyges, a Lydian, both of whom,  according to Pliny, acquired the knowledge of the art of painting in  Egypt, the Greeks obtained the knowledge of their _Ars Chromatica_,  which they are said to have carried by gradual advances during several  centuries, from the monochromatic of their earlier painters, to the  perfection of colouring under Zeuxis and Apelles, 450 to 350 B.C.  Unfortunately, not long after, or about 300 B.C., art rapidly  deteriorated; the invasion of the Romans commenced; and the principles  of light, shade, and colours in painting as understood by the Greeks,  together with their valuable treatises on the subject were lost. The  early Roman and Florentine painters, so eminent in other respects, were  almost destitute of those principles, and of truly refined feeling for  the effects of colouring.    The partial restoration of this branch seems to have been coeval with  the earliest practice of painting in oil. The glory of it belongs to the  Venetians, to whom the art of painting passed with the last remains of  the Greek schools after the capture of Constantinople at the beginning  of the thirteenth century. Giovanni Bellini laid the foundation of  colouring, and Titian carried it to its highest practical perfection.  From the Venetian it extended to the Lombard, Flemish, and Spanish  schools. In the practice of these, however, there was perhaps as much of  instinct as principle, colouring still remaining to be established in  its perfection as a science.    According to the true, natural, and philosophical classification of  painting, there are but three principal classes or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#1)"],[1,"ARABIAN NIGHTS          THE  ARABIAN NIGHTS    THEIR BEST-KNOWN TALES    EDITED BY    KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN  AND  NORA A. SMITH    ILLUSTRATED BY MAXFIELD PARRISH    NEW YORK  CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS  MCMIX    Copyright, 1909, by  CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS    Published October, 1909          PREFACE    _Little excuse is needed, perhaps, for any fresh selection from the  famous \"Tales of a Thousand and One Nights,\" provided it be  representative enough, and worthy enough, to enlist a new army of  youthful readers. Of the two hundred and sixty-four bewildering,  unparalleled stories, the true lover can hardly spare one, yet there  must always be favourites, even among these. We have chosen some of the  most delightful, in our opinion; some, too, that chanced to appeal  particularly to the genius of the artist. If, enticed by our choice and  the beauty of the pictures, we manage to attract a few thousand more  true lovers to the fountain-book, we shall have served our humble turn.  The only real danger lies in neglecting it, in rearing a child who does  not know it and has never fallen under its spell._    _You remember Maimoune, in the story of Prince Camaralzaman, and what she  said to Danhasch, the genie who had just arrived from the farthest  limits of China? \"Be sure thou tellest me nothing but what is true or I  shall clip thy wings!\" This is what the modern child sometimes says to  the genies of literature, and his own wings are too often clipped in  consequence._       _\"The Empire of the Fairies is no more.     Reason has banished them from ev'ry shore;     Steam has outstripped their dragons and their cars,     Gas has eclipsed their glow-worms and their stars.\"_    _Edouard Laboulaye says in his introduction to Nouveaux Contes Bleus:  \"Mothers who love your children, do not set them too soon to the study  of history; let them dream while they are young. Do not close the soul  to the first breath of poetry. Nothing affrights me so much as the  reasonable, practical child who believes in nothing that he cannot  touch. These sages of ten years are, at twenty, dullards, or what is  still worse, egoists.\"_    _When a child has once read of Prince Agib, of Gulnare or Periezade,  Sinbad or Codadad, in this or any other volume of its kind, the magic  will have been instilled into the blood, for the Oriental flavour in the  Arab tales is like nothing so much as magic. True enough they are a vast  storehouse of information concerning the manners and the customs, the  spirit and the life of the Moslem East (and the youthful reader does not  have to study Lane's learned foot-notes to imbibe all this), but beyond  and above the knowledge of history and geography thus gained, there  comes something finer and subtler as well as something more vital. The  scene is Indian, Egyptian, Arabian, Persian; but Bagdad and Balsora,  Grand Cairo, the silver Tigris, and the blooming gardens of Damascus,  though they can be found indeed on the map, live much more truly in that  enchanted realm that rises o'er \"the foam of perilous seas in faery  lands forlorn.\" What craft can sail those perilous seas like the book  that has been called a great three-decker to carry tired people to  Islands of the Blest? \"The immortal fragment,\" says Sir Richard Burton,  who perhaps knew the Arabian Nights as did no other European, \"will  never be superseded in the infallible judgment of childhood. The  marvellous imaginativeness of the Tales produces an insensible  brightness of mind and an increase of fancy-power, making one dream that  behind them lies the new and unseen, the strange and unexpected--in  fact, all the glamour of the unknown.\"_    _It would be a delightful task to any boy or girl to begin at the  beginning and read the first English version of these famous stories,  made from the collection of M. Galland, Professor of Arabic in the Royal  College of Paris. The fact that they had passed from Arabic into French  and from French into English did not prevent their instantaneous  popularity. This was in 1704 or thereabouts, and the world was not so  busy as it is nowadays, or young men would not have gathered in the  middle of the night under M. Galland's window and cried: \"O vous, qui  savez de si jolis contes, et qui les racontez si bien, racontez nous en  un!\"_    _You can also read them in Scott's edition or in Lane's (both of which,  but chiefly the former, we have used as the foundation of our text),  while your elders--philologists or Orientalists--are studying the  complete versions of John Payne or Sir Richard Burton. You may leave the  wiseacres to wonder which were told in China or India, Arabia or Persia,  and whether the first manuscript dates back to 1450 or earlier._    _We, like many other editors, have shortened the stories here and there,  omitting some of the tedious repetitions that crept in from time to time  when Arabian story-tellers were adding to the text to suit their  purposes._    _Mr. Andrew Lang says amusingly that he has left out of his special  versions \"all the pieces that are suitable only for Arabs and old  gentlemen,\" and we have done the same; but we have taken no undue  liberties. We have removed no genies nor magicians, however terrible;  have cut out no base deed of Vizier nor noble deed of Sultan; have  diminished the size of no roc's egg, nor omitted any single allusion to  the great and only Haroun Al-raschid, Caliph of Bagdad, Commander of the  Faithful, who must have been a great inspirer of good stories._    _Enter into this \"treasure house of pleasant things,\" then, and make  yourself at home in the golden palaces, the gem-studded caves, the  bewildering gardens. Sit by its mysterious fountains, hear the plash of  its gleaming cascades, unearth its magic lamps and talismans, behold its  ensorcelled princes and princesses._    _Nowhere in the whole realm of literature will you find such a Marvel,  such a Wonder, such a Nonesuch of a book; nowhere will you find  impossibilities so real and so convincing; nowhere but in what Henley  calls:_       _\"... that blessed brief       Of what is gallantest and best     In all the full-shelved Libraries of Romance.
