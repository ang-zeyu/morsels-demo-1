EDITORIAL FOREWORD      To be successful in woodwork construction the possession of two secrets  is essential--to know the right joint to use, and to know how to make  that joint in the right way. The woodwork structure or the piece of  cabinet-work that endures is the one on which skilful hands have combined  to carry out what the constructive mind planned. And it is just here that  the present Volume will help, not alone the beginner who wishes  preliminary instruction, but also the expert who desires guidance over  ground hitherto unexplored by him.    In the preparation of this new edition the Publishers have secured the  services of Mr. William Fairham, by whom the chapters have been carefully  revised and re-illustrated. Although intended for the practical man, and  not professing to be a graded course of \"educational woodwork,\" the  Volume is one which Handicraft Instructors will find of the greatest  value in conducting woodwork classes. No book hitherto published contains  such a variety of illustrations of joints, almost all of which will form  suitable exercises of practical educational importance in a woodworking  course.

(From  _The Woodworker_, September, 1929.)]          THE GLUED JOINT      The glued joint in its various forms is in use in every country in the  world, and is frequently met with in mummy cases and other examples of  ancient woodwork. Alternative names under which it is known are the butt  joint, the rubbed joint, the slipped joint, whilst in certain localities  it is known as the slaped (pronounced _slayped_) joint.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Simplest Form of Glued or Rubbed Joint.]    The glued joint is made by planing two pieces of timber so that when  placed together they are in contact with each other at every point; they  are then usually united with glue. Fig. 1 shows a sketch of a butt joint  in its simplest form. In Fig. 2 is indicated the method of holding the  joint whilst being glued; the upright portion is held rigid in the bench  vice, thus leaving the left hand to hold the piece which is to be  jointed, whilst the right hand operates the glue brush. The pieces of  wood which form a butt joint may be glued together with or without the  aid of cramps or artificial pressure. If the joint is to be made without  cramping, the two surfaces of the timber are warmed so as not to chill  the glue. The surfaces are then glued and put together and rubbed  backwards and forwards so as to get rid of the superfluous glue. They are  then put aside to dry.    GLUEING.--The better the glue penetrates into the pores of the wood, the  stronger the joint will be; for this reason timber of the loose-fibred  variety, such as pine, etc., will hold up at the joint better than  hardwoods like teak and rosewood. The glue used for jointing should be  neither too thick nor too thin; the consistency of cream will be found  suitable for most purposes. It should be nice and hot, and be rapidly  spread over the surface of the wood.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--How the Wood is held whilst Glueing.]    If light-coloured woods, such as pine, satinwood, sycamore, etc., have to  be jointed, a little flake white should be procured and mixed into the  liquid glue. This will prevent the glue showing a thin black line on the  joint.    Broad surfaces of close-grained hardwood having a shiny surface are  usually carefully roughened with a fine toothing plane blade previous to  glueing.    SUPPORTING THE JOINT.--The jointed boards should not be reared up against  a \"bench leg\" or wall without having any support in the centre, as dotted  line at Fig. 5, because in all probability they will fracture before the  glue has time to set; and, when we go to take them up to renew working  operations, we shall be annoyed to find that they have assumed a  position similar to that at Fig. 5 (shown exaggerated), and this will, of  course, necessitate re-jointing.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Correct Jointing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Faulty Jointing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Boards unsupported.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Boards supported.]    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--(A) Glued Slip, (B) Glued Moulding.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Grain alternating.]    A correct method to adopt is seen at Fig. 6. Here we have supported the  joint by rearing up against the wall a couple of pieces of batten, one  at each end of the board, thus supporting it throughout its entire width  until the glue is thoroughly set. The two or more pieces of timber in a  butt joint adhere by crystallisation of the glue and atmospheric  pressure. A well-fitted joint made with good quality glue is so strong  that, when boards of 3 feet and upwards are jointed together by this  method, the timber in most cases will break with the grain sooner than  part at the joint.    Butt joints may be cramped up, if desired, and it is customary to warm  them as previously stated. In the absence of the usual iron cramp, the  amateur may make an excellent wooden arrangement out of any odd pieces of  timber that happen to be handy. Two blocks of hardwood are screwed on the  base board at a suitable distance for the work in hand; the boards to be  jointed are glued and placed in position between the blocks; and the two  hardwood wedges are inserted and hammered in opposite directions to each  other, thus exerting the desired pressure. An example of this method of  cramping is shown in Fig. 25, which also indicates the use of iron  \"dogs.\"    When jointing, care should be taken to first plane up the boards true on  one side--_i.e._, take them out of winding. The method of testing for  this is shown at Fig. 9, and it may with advantage be used when jointing  the edges of the boards. Two laths or strips of wood are planed up to  exactly the same width, having their edges straight and parallel. One  edge of each lath may, if desired, be bevelled a little. The method of  using these \"twist sticks\" or \"winding laths\" is to put them on the board  as indicated, and sight along their top edges. The winding laths, being  much longer than the width of the board, show up the irregularity greatly  pronounced.    THE TOOLS generally used for making the butt joints are:--    The jack plane, for roughing the edges, etc.    The wooden trying plane (or iron jointing plane) for trueing up the work.    The try square for testing purposes.    The winding laths and straight edge.    THE METHOD OF WORK is as follows: Each board is in turn put in the vice  and planed straight lengthwise; it is then tested with winding laths and  a try square (the latter method is shown at Fig. 22).    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Testing Surface with Winding Laths.]    The boards are then put on the top of one another as at Fig. 1 and tested  with a straight edge; they should appear true as shown at Fig. 3; if they  show faulty as at Fig. 4 the joints must be again fitted until the  required degree of accuracy is obtained. Difficulties may be avoided by  care in selecting timber suitable for jointing, and it must be remembered  that timber shrinks circumferentially (the heart side becoming curved) as  dotted lines in Fig. 10. If the timber be jointed with all the heart side  one way as at Fig. 10, the tendency will be for it to cast as shown by  the dotted line. If the timber be alternated as at Fig. 11, the tendency  will be to cast wavy, whereas if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#1)"],[1,"and Clothing    BY    KATE HEINTZ WATSON      GRADUATE ARMOUR INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY    FORMERLY INSTRUCTOR IN DOMESTIC ART    LEWIS INSTITUTE    LECTURER UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO      [Illustration: American School of Home Economics seal]      CHICAGO    AMERICAN SCHOOL OF HOME ECONOMICS    1907      COPYRIGHT 1906, 1907, BY    HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION      THE LIBRARY  OF  HOME ECONOMICS      A COMPLETE HOME-STUDY COURSE      ON THE NEW PROFESSION OF HOME-MAKING AND ART OF RIGHT LIVING;    THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE MOST RECENT ADVANCES    IN THE ARTS AND SCIENCES TO HOME AND HEALTH      PREPARED BY TEACHERS OF    RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY      FOR HOME-MAKERS, MOTHERS, TEACHERS, PHYSICIANS, NURSES, DIETITIANS,    PROFESSIONAL HOUSE MANAGERS, AND ALL INTERESTED    IN HOME, HEALTH, ECONOMY AND CHILDREN        TWELVE VOLUMES      NEARLY THREE THOUSAND PAGES, ONE THOUSAND ILLUSTRATIONS    TESTED BY USE IN CORRESPONDENCE INSTRUCTION    REVISED AND SUPPLEMENTED      [Illustration: American School of Home Economics seal]      CHICAGO    AMERICAN SCHOOL OF HOME ECONOMICS    1907        Copyright, 1907    by    Home Economics Association      Entered at Stationers' Hall, London    _All Rights Reserved._      AUTHORS    ISABEL BEVIER, Ph.

From a Painting.]          TEXTILES AND CLOTHING      [Sidenote: Origin of Textile Arts]    Spinning and weaving are among the earliest arts. In the twisting of  fibers, hairs, grasses, and sinews by rolling them between the thumb and  fingers, palms of the hands, or palms and naked thigh, we have the  original of the spinning wheel and the steam-driven cotton spindle; in  the roughest plaiting we have the first hint of the finest woven cloth.  The need of securing things or otherwise strengthening them then led to  binding, fastening, and sewing. The wattle-work hut with its roof of  interlaced boughs, the skins sewn by fine needles with entrails or  sinews, the matted twigs, grasses, and rushes are all the crude  beginnings of an art which tells of the settled life of to-day.    [Sidenote: Primitive Methods]    Nothing is definitely known of the origin of these arts; all is  conjecture. They doubtless had their beginning long before mention "]]]
