In  the grammar much aid has been derived from Paul's _Mittelhochdeutsche  Grammatik_, second edition, Halle, 1884, and Weinhold's  _Mittelhochdeutsche Grammatik_, second edition, Paderborn, 1883. The  former work, besides containing by far the most complete syntax, is also  the only Middle High German Grammar which is based on the present state  of German Philology.... I believe that the day is not far distant when  English students will take a much more lively interest in the study of  their own and the other Germanic languages (especially German and Old  Norse) than has hitherto been the case. And if this little book should  contribute anything towards furthering the cause, it will have amply  fulfilled its purpose.      LONDON: _January, 1888._      When I wrote the preface to the first edition of this primer in 1888,  I ventured to predict that the interest of English students in the  subject would grow and develop as time went on, but I hardly expected  that it would grow so much that a second edition of the book would be  required within so short a period. It has been revised throughout, and  several changes have been made in the phonology, but I have not thought  it advisable to alter the general plan and scope of the former edition.  After many years of personal experience as a teacher and examiner in the  older periods of the German language, I have become firmly convinced  that the larger books on the subject contain too many details for  beginners. I feel sure that the easiest and best way to acquire a  thorough knowledge of Middle High German is to start with an elementary  book like the present, and then to learn the details of the grammar,  especially the phonology of the various dialects, from a more advanced  work.      OXFORD: _December, 1898._        PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION    In the preparation of the new edition, I have steadily kept in view the  class of students for whom the book was originally written. When the  first edition appeared twenty-eight years ago, there were very few  students in this country who took up the serious study of the older  periods of the various Germanic languages at the Universities. In late  years, however, the interest in the study of these languages has grown  so much that Honour Courses and Examinations in them have been  established at all our Universities. The result is that a book even  intended for beginners can now reasonably be expected to be of a higher  standard than the previous editions of this Primer. The grammatical  introduction has accordingly been entirely rewritten and expanded to  more than twice its original size. The texts have also been nearly  doubled by the addition of eighteen poems from Walther von der  Vogelweide, and selections from Reinmar, Ulrich von Lichtenstein, and  Wolfram von Eschenbach.    The greater part of Middle High German literature is so excellent and  interesting that most students, who have mastered the grammatical  introduction and read the texts in the Primer, will doubtless desire to  continue the subject. Such students should procure a copy of either the  _Mittelhochdeutsche Grammatik_ by Hermann Paul, eighth edition, Halle,  1911, or the _Mittelhochdeutsches Elementarbuch_ by Victor Michels,  second edition, Heidelberg, 1912, where the Grammar, especially the  phonology and syntax, can be studied in greater detail. They should also  procure a copy of the _Mittelhochdeutsches Taschenw[o:]rterbuch_ by  Matthias Lexer, tenth edition, Leipzig, 1910, and also have access to  the two standard Middle High German dictionaries-- _Mittelhochdeutsches  W[o:]rterbuch mit Benutzung des Nachlasses von Georg Friedrich Benecke_,  ausgearbeitet von Wilhelm M[u:]ller und Friedrich Zarncke, drei B[a:]nde,  Leipzig, 1854-61, and _Mittelhochdeutsches W[o:]rterbuch_, von Matthias  Lexer, zugleich als Supplement und alphabetischer Index zum  _Mittelhochdeutschen W[o:]rterbuch_ von Benecke-M[u:]ller-Zarncke,  drei B[a:]nde, Leipzig, 1872-78. An excellent bibliography of the best  editions of the Middle High German texts-- classified according to the  dialects in which they were written-- will be found on pp. 20-35 of  Michels' _Elementarbuch_.    May the new edition of the Primer continue to further the study of the  subject in the future to the same extent as it has done in the past!      JOSEPH WRIGHT.

FOUR CHILDREN WOULD NOT READ SCOTT      SO I told them these stories--and others--to lure them to the printed  book, much as carrots are dangled before the nose of the reluctant  donkey. They are four average intelligent children enough, but they hold  severely modern views upon storybooks. _Waverley_, in especial, they  could not away with. They found themselves stuck upon the very  threshold.    Now, since the first telling of these Red Cap Tales, the Scott shelf in  the library has been taken by storm and escalade. It is permanently  gap-toothed all along the line. Also there are nightly skirmishes, even  to the laying on of hands, as to who shall sleep with _Waverley_ under  his pillow.    It struck me that there must be many oldsters in the world who, for the  sake of their own youth, would like the various Sweethearts who now  inhabit their nurseries, to read Sir Walter with the same breathless  eagerness as they used to do--how many years agone? It is chiefly for  their sakes that I have added several interludes, telling how  Sweetheart, Hugh John, Sir Toady Lion, and Maid Margaret received my  petty larcenies from the full chest of the Wizard.    At any rate, Red Cap succeeded in one case--why should he not in  another? I claim no merit in the telling of the tales, save that, like  medicines well sugar-coated, the patients mistook them for candies  and--asked for more.    The books are open. Any one can tell Scott's stories over again in his  own way. This is mine.                                                           S. R. CROCKETT.

She and I were at Dryburgh Abbey, sitting quietly on a rustic seat, and  looking toward the aisle in which slept the Great Dead. The long  expected had happened, and we had made pilgrimage to our Mecca. Yet, in  spite of the still beauty of the June day, I could see that a shadow lay  upon our Sweetheart's brow.    \"Oh, I know he was great,\" she burst out at last, \"and what you read me  out of the _Life_ was nice. I like hearing about Sir Walter--but--\"    I knew what was coming.    \"But what?\" I said, looking severely at the ground, so that I might be  able to harden my heart against the pathos of Sweetheart's expression.    \"But--I can't read the novels--indeed I can't. I have tried _Waverley_  at least twenty times. And as for _Rob Roy_--\"    Even the multiplication table failed here, and at this, variously  a-sprawl on the turf beneath, the smaller fry giggled.    \"Course,\" said Hugh John, who was engaged in eating grass like an ox,  \"we know it is true about _Rob Roy_. She read us one whole volume, and  there wasn't no Rob Roy, nor any fighting in it.
