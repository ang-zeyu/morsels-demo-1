My Dear Sir:         Permit me to dedicate to you this work on our National Medals,       as a slight testimonial for your distinguished services during       your long official residence in Paris, and especially during       the siege of that city in 1870-1871, when you had under your       protection the subjects of fourteen governments besides your       own, and yet so discharged your delicate and responsible duties       as to win universal approbation.                                  Yours sincerely,                                                  J. F. LOUBAT.       New-York, Union Club, _May_, _1878_.          INTRODUCTION.                                                      (p. vii)      Medals, by means of the engraver's art, perpetuate in a durable form  and within a small compass which the eye can embrace at a glance, not  only the features of eminent persons, but the dates, brief accounts,  and representations (direct or emblematical) of events; they rank,  therefore, among the most valuable records of the past, especially  when they recall men, deeds, or circumstances which have influenced  the life of nations. How much light has been furnished for the study  of history by the concise and faithful testimony of these silent  witnesses! The importance of medals is now universally acknowledged,  and in almost every country they are preserved with reverent care, and  made the subject of costly publications, illustrated by elaborate  engravings, with carefully prepared letter-press descriptions and  notes. Up to the present time no thorough work devoted to the medals  of the United States of America has been published. When I entered  upon the task, several years ago, of investigating their history  (p. viii)  for the period embracing the first century of the Republic, I had  little conception of the difficulties to be encountered. The search  involved a very considerable expenditure of time and labor, but at  last I have the satisfaction of offering to the public the result of  my investigations, completed according to the original plan.    Although our political history measures but a hundred years, it  records so many memorable deeds, and the names of so many illustrious  citizens, that our medals form, even now, an historically valuable  collection, to say nothing of the great artistic merit of some of  them. During the War of Independence alone, how many exploits, how  many heroes do we find worthy of being thus honored! How numerous  would have been our medals if Congress had not been imbued with the  conviction that only the very highest achievements are entitled to  such a distinction, and that the value of a reward is enhanced by its  rarity! In voting those struck after the War of 1812-'15 with Great  Britain, and after that of 1846-'47 with Mexico, the same discretion  was shown. There was still greater necessity for reserve during the  late Civil War, and only two were presented during that painful  period: one to Ulysses S. Grant, then a major-general, for victories,  and another to Cornelius Vanderbilt, in acknowledgment of his free  gift of the steamship which bore his name.    Similar national rewards have been earned also by deeds which interest  humanity, science, or commerce; as, for instance, the laying of the  transatlantic telegraph cable, the expedition of Doctor Kane to the  Arctic Seas, and the beneficence of George Peabody. If to these are  added the Indian peace medals, bearing the effigies of our          (p. ix)  successive Presidents, the various elements which compose the official  medals of the United States of America will have been enumerated.    As neither titles of nobility nor orders of knighthood exist in our  country, Congress can bestow no higher distinction on an American  citizen than to offer him the thanks of the nation, and to order that  a medal be struck in his honor. I cannot do better than to quote here  the words of General Winfield Scott, when he received from President  Monroe the medal voted to him for the battles of Chippewa and Niagara:    \"With a deep sense of the additional obligation now contracted, I  accept at the hands of the venerable Chief Magistrate of the Union the  classic token of the highest reward a free man can receive: the  recorded approbation of his country.\"    Our medals number eighty-six in all, most of which were struck by  order of Congress in honor of citizens of the United States. Seventeen  belong to the period of the Revolution, twenty-seven to the War of  1812-'15, four to the Mexican War, and two to the Civil War. Only five  were voted to foreigners: one, in 1779, to Lieutenant-Colonel de  Fleury, a French gentleman in the Continental Army, for gallant  conduct at Stony Point; another, in 1858, to Dr. Frederick Rose, an  assistant-surgeon in the British Navy for kindness and humanity to  sick seamen on one of our men-of-war; and the others, in 1866, to three  foreign merchant captains, Messrs. Creighton, Low, and Stouffer, who,  in December, 1853, went to the aid of the steamer San Francisco,     (p. x)  thereby \"rescuing about five hundred Americans.\"    Seven of the eighty-six medals do not owe their origin to a  congressional vote: two which were struck in the United Netherlands  (1782), one to commemorate their acknowledgment of the United States  of America, and the other the treaty of amity and commerce between the  two countries; that known as Libertas Americana (1783); the two in  honor of Franklin (1784-1786); the Diplomatic medal (1790); and lastly  that struck in memory of the conclusion of the treaty of commerce  between the United States and France (1822). Although these cannot  properly be classed as official medals, their historic importance and  value as works of art entitle them to a place in our national  collection.    Nearly all of the early medals were executed by French engravers,  whose names alone are a warrant for the artistic merit of their work.  We are indebted to Augustin Dupre, who has been called the \"great  Dupre\" for the Daniel Morgan, the Nathaniel Greene, the John Paul  Jones, the Libertas Americana, the two Franklin, and the Diplomatic  medals; to Pierre Simon Duvivier for those of George Washington, de  Fleury, William Augustine Washington, and John Eager Howard; to  Nicolas Marie Gatteaux for those of Horatio Gates, Anthony Wayne, and  John Stewart; and to Bertrand Andrieu and Raymond Gayrard for the one  in commemoration of the signature of the treaty of commerce between  France and the United States.    Congress had not yet proclaimed the independence of the thirteen  United Colonies when, on March 25, 1776, it ordered that a gold     (p. xi)  medal be struck and presented to \"His Excellency, General Washington,\"  for his \"wise and spirited conduct in the siege and acquisition of  Boston.\" But this, although the first one voted, was not engraved  until after the de Fleury and the Libertas Americana pieces, both of  which were executed in Paris under the direction of Benjamin Franklin.  The following letter gives the date of the de Fleury medal:         To His Excellency          Mr. HUNTINGTON,                      Passy, March 4, 1780.              President of Congress.         Sir: Agreeably to the order of Congress, I have employed one of       the best artists here in cutting the dies for the medal intended       for M. de Fleury. The price of such work is beyond my       expectation, being a thousand livres for each die. I shall try if       it is not possible to have the others done cheaper.           -       -       -       -       -         With great respect I have the honour to be, Sir, your most       obedient and most humble servant,                                               B. FRANKLIN.    This medal was shown in the exhibition of the Royal Academy in Paris  in 1781. The Libertas Americana piece was struck in 1783.    Six of the earliest of the series were designed under the supervision  of Colonel David Humphreys, namely, those for Generals Washington,  Gates, Greene, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21894"],[0,"The Rover Boys at Colby Hall; or, The Struggles of the Young Cadets (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from scans of public domain material produced by  Microsoft for their Live Search Books site.)

GROSSET & DUNLAP, Publishers, New York    COPYRIGHT, 1917, BY  EDWARD STRATEMEYER      _The Rover Boys at Colby Hall_          INTRODUCTION      MY DEAR BOYS: This book is a complete story in itself, but forms the  first volume in a line issued under the general title, \"The Second  Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"    As mentioned in several of the other volumes of the first series, this  line was started a number of years ago with the publication of \"The  Rover Boys at School,\" in which my readers were introduced to Dick,  Tom, and Sam Rover, three wide-awake American lads. In that volume and  in those which followed I gave the particulars of their adventures  while attending Putnam Hall Military Academy, Brill College, and while  on numerous outings, both in our own country and abroad.    The Rover boys were, of course, growing older; and, having met three  young ladies very much to their liking, each married and settled down,  as related in detail in the several volumes immediately preceding this.  They were well established in business; and in due course of time Dick  Rover was blessed with a son, as was also Sam, while the fun-loving Tom  became the proud possessor of a pair of twins who were as full of life  as their father had ever been.    In this volume the younger Rover boys are old enough to go to boarding  school. They are sent to Colby Hall Military Academy, presided over by  an old friend and schoolmate of their fathers; and there they make both  friends and enemies, and have numerous adventures.    In the beginning this chronicle of the younger Rovers, I wish to thank  my numerous readers for all the kind things they have said about the  other volumes in these series, and I trust that they will make just as  good friends of Jack, Andy and Randy, and Fred as they did of Dick,  Tom, and Sam Rover.    Affectionately and sincerely yours,    EDWARD STRATEMEYER.

But don't be too severe with 'em,\" pleaded Tom Rover.  \"Remember, boys will be boys.\"    \"That's true, Tom. But we've got to take 'em in hand sooner or later,\"  remonstrated his brother Sam. \"If we don't, they'll grow up the wildest  bunch ever known.\"    A number of cries of alarm and protest, mingled with fierce cheering,  had reached the house from the garden just beyond the broad veranda. As  the three Rover brothers hurried through the hallway and outside, the  yelling and cheering were renewed. Then, just as Tom Rover stepped out  on the veranda, there was a sudden swish and a stream of water from a  garden hose caught him directly in the left ear.    \"Hi! Hi! Stop that!\" cried Tom Rover, doing his best to dodge the  stream of water, which suddenly seemed to play all over the piazza.  \"What do you mean by wetting me this way?\"    \"It wasn't my fault, Dad,\" came from a boy standing on the lawn, both  hands clutching a rubber hose held, also, by another boy of about the  same age. \"It was Fred who turned the hose that way.\"    \"Nothing of the sort! It was Randy twisted it that way trying to get it  away from me,\" cried Fred Rover. \"And he isn't going to do it!\" and  thereupon ensued a struggle between the two boys which caused the  stream of water to fly over the garden first in one direction and then  another.    In the meanwhile, not far away another stream of water was issuing from  a hose held by two other lads. This, as well as the water from hose  number one, had been directed towards the back of the garden, where an  elderly white man and an equally elderly colored man were trying to  shelter themselves behind a low hedge to keep from becoming drenched.    \"Fo' de lan's' sake, Massa Dick! won't you make dem boys stop?\" cried  out the old colored man, when he caught sight of Dick Rover hurrying  out on the lawn. \"Dem boys is jest nacherly tryin' to drown old Aleck  Pop, dat's what dey is!\"    \"They didn't have no call to touch them hoses,\" came from the elderly  white man. \"I tol' 'em they mustn't muss with the water; but they won't  mind nohow!\" and thus speaking old Jack Ness held up his hands in comic  despair.    \"Why! we didn't know you were behind the hedge,\" came from one of the  boys holding the second hose. \"We thought you were both down at the  barn.\"    \"You can't make believe like that, Andy Rover!\" returned the old man of  all work, shaking his head vigorously. \"You knowed I was goin' to trim  up this hedge a bit and that Aleck was goin' to help me.\"    \"You boys let up with this nonsense,\" came sternly from Tom Rover. He  turned to face one of his twins. \"Randy, I ought to give you a  thrashing for wetting me like this.\"    \"Don't Fred get half the thrashing?\" questioned Randy Rover,  quizzically, for he could readily see that his parent was not as angry  as his words seemed to imply. \"I don't like to be selfish, you know. He  can have more than his share if he wants it.\"    \"You'll take your own thrashings--I don't want 'em,\" broke in his  cousin Fred quickly.    \"Jack,\" cried Dick Rover, turning to his son, \"turn that water off at  once.\"    \"I don't know where to turn it off. I didn't turn it on,\" answered Jack  Rover, the oldest of the four boys who"]]]
