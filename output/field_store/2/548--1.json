Illustrated by F. C. GORDON        [Illustration]        NEW YORK    Copyright by    E. P. DUTTON AND COMPANY    31 WEST TWENTY-THIRD STREET    1899          TO THE CHILDREN    _Dear Little Friends:_    I want to introduce the farmyard people to you, and to have you call  upon them and become better acquainted as soon as you can. Some of them  are working for us, and we surely should know them. Perhaps, too, some  of us are working for them, since that is the way in this delightful  world of ours, and one of the happiest parts of life is helping and  being helped.    It is so in the farmyard, and although there is not much work that the  people there can do for each other, there are many kind things to be  said, and even the Lame Duckling found that he could make the Blind  Horse happy when he tried. It is there as it is everywhere else, and I  sometimes think that although the farmyard people do not look like us or  talk like us, they are not so very different after all. If you had seen  the little Chicken who wouldn't eat gravel when his mother was reproving  him, you could not have helped knowing his thoughts even if you did not  understand a word of the Chicken language. He was thinking, \"I don't  care! I don't care a bit! So now!\" That was long since, for he was a  Chicken when I was a little girl, and both of us grew up some time ago.  I think I have always been more sorry for him because when he was  learning to eat gravel I was learning to eat some things which I did not  like; and so, you see, I knew exactly how he felt. But it was not until  afterwards that I found out how his mother felt.    That is one of the stories which I have been keeping a long time for  you, and the Chicken was a particular friend of mine. I knew him better  than I did some of his neighbors; yet they were all pleasant  acquaintances, and if I did not see some of these things happen with my  own eyes, it is just because I was not in the farmyard at the right  time. There are many other tales I should like to tell you about them,  but one mustn't make the book too fat and heavy for your hands to hold,  so I will send you these and keep the rest.    Many stories might be told about our neighbors who live out-of-doors,  and they are stories that ought to be told, too, for there are still  boys and girls who do not know that animals think and talk and work, and  love their babies, and help each other when in trouble. I knew one boy  who really thought it was not wrong to steal newly built birds'-nests,  and I have seen girls--quite large ones, too--who were afraid of Mice!  It was only last winter that a Quail came to my front door, during the  very cold weather, and snuggled down into the warmest corner he could  find. I fed him, and he stayed there for several days, and I know, and  you know, perfectly well that although he did not say it in so many  words, he came to remind me that I had not yet told you a Quail story.  And two of my little neighbors brought ten Polliwogs to spend the day  with me, so I promised then and there that the next book should be about  pond people and have a Polliwog story in it.    And now, good-bye! Perhaps some of you will write me about your visits  to the farmyard. I hope you will enjoy them very much, but be sure you  don't wear red dresses or caps when you call on the Turkey Gobbler.          Your friend,    CLARA DILLINGHAM PIERSON.

There was not a cloud in the sky, and the meadow was covered  with thousands and thousands of green grass blades, each so small and  tender, and yet together making a most beautiful carpet for the feet of  the farmyard people, and offering them sweet and juicy food after their  winter fare of hay and grain. Truly it was a day to make one laugh aloud  for joy. The alder tassels fluttered and danced in the spring breeze,  while the smallest and shyest of the willow pussies crept from their  little brown houses on the branches to grow in the sunshine.    [Illustration: THE SWALLOWS ARE COMING.]    \"Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee! Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee!\" And this time it was  louder and clearer than before.    \"The Swallows!\" cried the Oxen to each other. Then they straightened  their strong necks and bellowed to the Horses, who were drawing the plow  in the field beyond, \"The Swallows are coming!\"    As soon as the Horses reached the end of the furrow and could rest a  minute, they tossed their heads and whinnied with delight. Then they  looked around at the farmer, and wished that he knew enough of the  farmyard language to understand what they wanted to tell him. They knew  he would be glad to hear of their friends' return, for had they not seen  him pick up a young Swallow one day and put him in a safer place?    \"Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee!\" and there was a sudden darkening of the sky  above their heads, a whirr of many wings, a chattering and laughing of  soft voices, and the Swallows had come. Perched on the ridge-pole of the  big barn, they rested and visited and heard all the news.    The Doves were there, walking up and down the sloping sides of the roof  and cooing to each other about the simple things of every-day life. You  know the Doves stay at home all winter, and so it makes a great change  when their neighbors, the Swallows, return. They are firm friends in  spite of their very different ways of living. There was never a Dove  who would be a Swallow if he could, yet the plump, quiet, gray and white  Doves dearly love the dashing Swallows, and happy is the Squab who can  get a Swallow to tell him stories of the great world.    \"Isn't it good to be home, home, home!\" sang one Swallow. \"I never set  my claws on another ridge-pole as comfortable as this.\"    \"I'm going to look at my old nest,\" said a young Swallow, as she  suddenly flew down to the eaves.    \"I think I'll go, too,\" said another young Swallow, springing away from  his perch. He was a handsome fellow, with a glistening dark blue head  and back, a long forked tail which showed a white stripe on the under  side, a rich buff vest, and a deep blue collar, all of the finest  feathers. He loved the young Swallow whom he was following, and he  wanted to tell her so.    \"There is the nest where I was hatched,\" she said. \"Would you think I  was ever crowded in there with five brothers and sisters? It was a  comfortable nest, too, before the winter winds and snow wore it away. I  wonder how it would seem to be a fledgling again?\" She snuggled down in  the old nest until he could see only her forked tail and her dainty head  over the edge. Her vest was quite hidden, and the only light feathers  that showed were the reddish-buff ones on throat and face; these "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19389"],[0,"Child Songs of Cheer (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                                          [Illustration: DANDELIONS]               Dandelions, dandelions, shining through the dew,             Let the Kings have Cloth of Gold, but let _us_ have _you_!

Such pretty things are to be seen,        Such pleasant things to do,      The April earth it is so green,        The April sky so blue,      The path from dawn to even-song        So joyous is to-day,      Up, little ones! and dance along        The lilac-scented way!

See the meadows twinkling now, beautiful and bright      As the sky when through the blue shine the stars at night!        Once upon a time, folks say, mighty kings of old      Met upon a splendid field called \"The Cloth of Gold.\"        But, we wonder, could it be there was ever seen      Brighter gold than glitters now in our meadows green?        Dandelions, dandelions, shining through the dew,      Let the kings have Cloth of Gold, but let _us_ have _you_!          OUR PUPPIES          Little ears as soft as silk,      Little teeth as white as milk,      Little noses cool and pink,      Little eyes that blink and blink,      Little bodies round and fat,      Little hearts that pit-a-pat,      Surely prettier puppies never      Were before nor can be ever!          THE LOST BALLOON          O dear! my purple toy balloon      Has flown away! and very soon      It will be high up as the moon!        And don't you think the man up there      Will wonder what it is, and stare?      Perhaps hell say, \"_Well, I declare!_\"        Or, maybe if it chance there are      Some little boys in yonder star,      And if it floats away so far,        Perhaps they'll jump up very high      And catch the cord as it goes by!      At any rate I hope they'll try!          THE CIRCUS PROCESSION          _Oh, hurry! hurry!_ here they come,      The band in front with the big bass drum      And blaring bugles,--there they are,      On golden thrones in a golden car,      Tooting and fluting, oh, how grand!                  Hi diddle, diddle!                  The fife and the fiddle!      _Hurrah, hurrah_ for the circus band!        And the red-plumed horses, oh, see them prance      And daintily lift their hoofs and dance,      While beautiful ladies with golden curls      Are jingling their bridles of gold and pearls,                  And close behind                  Come every kind      Of animal cages great and small,      O how I wonder what's in them all!        Here's one that's open and glaring there      Is the shaggiest snow-white polar bear!      _Woof!_ but I wonder what we'd do      If his bars broke loose right now, don't you?                  And O dear me!                  Just look and see      That pink-cheeked lady in skirts of gauze      And the great big lion with folded paws!                  O me! O my!                  I'm glad that I      Am not in that lion's cage, because      _Suppose he'd open his horrible jaws!_      --But look! the clown is coming! Of course      Facing the tail of a spotted horse      And shouting out things to make folks laugh,      And grinning up at the tall giraffe      That placidly paces along and looks      Just like giraffes in the picture-books!        And there are the elephants, two and two,      Lumbering on as they always do!      The men who lead them look so small      I wonder the elephants mind at all                  As they wag their queer                  Long trunks, and peer      Through their beady eyes,--folks say they know      No end of things, and I'm sure it's so!      And you never must do a thing that's bad      Or that possibly might make an elephant mad,      For he'll never forgive you, it appears,      And will punish you sure, if it takes him _years!_                  So do not stare                  But take good care      To mind your manners, and always try      To smile politely as they go by!        But the camels don't care if you laugh at them      With their bumpy humps like a capital M,                  They lurch and sway                  And seem to say,      As they wrinkle their noses, long and gray,      \"This swaggering stride is quite the plan,      It's the way we walked in the caravan!\"        And now more cages come rumbling by      With glittering people throned on high;      So many spangles and precious things,      They surely must all be queens and kings!                  They look so proud                  Above the crowd,      O my, how fine it must feel to ride      On golden wagons that hide inside      Strange animals caught in cannibal isles      And brought in ships for a million miles!                  But hark! it's near                  The end, for hear      That sudden screeching in piercing key!      The steaming, screaming _cal-li-o-pe_!      Just plain pianos sound terribly tame      Beside this one with the wonderful name,      And wouldn't you love some day to sit      In a circus wagon and play on it?          MAY-BASKETS          Let us take our baskets early        To the meadows green,      While the wild-flowers still are pearly        With the dewdrops' sheen.        Fill them full of blossoms rosy,        Violets and gay      Cowslips, every pretty posy        Welcoming the May.        Then our lovely loads we'll carry        Down the village street,      On each door, with laughter merry,        Hang a basket sweet.        Hey-a-day-day! It is spring now,        Lazy folks, awake!      See the pretty things we bring now        For the May-day's sake!          THE PICTURE-BOOK GIANT          Once there was a fierce, defiant,      Greedy, grumpy, grizzly giant        In the pages of a picture-book, and he      Sometimes screamed, in sudden rages,      \"I must jump out from these pages,        For this life's a much too humdrum one for me!                    Fiddle-dee!        Yes, this life's a quite too quiet one for me!\"        So one rainy day he did it,      Took the picture-book and hid it,        Stamped his foot, and shouting loudly,            \"Now I'm free!\"      Boldly started out, forgetting      That he could not stand a wetting!      He was just a paper giant, don't you see?                Dearie me!      Just a gaudy, picture giant, don't you see?          DID YOU EVER?          Did you ever see a fairy in a rose-leaf coat and cap      Swinging in a cobweb hammock as he napped his noonday nap?        Did you ever see one waken very thirsty and drink up      All the honey-dew that glimmered in a golden buttercup?        Did you ever see one fly"]]]
