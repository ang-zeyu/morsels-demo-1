A. Donohue & Co.  Chicago  Copyright 1916  by  M. A. Donohue and Company            BY WAY of INTRODUCTION    [Illustration]      Nothing has ever been written that appeals to a child's nature more  than \"A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES.\" It is written in a simple verse  that a child can readily understand. It was one of the earlier efforts  of the author, Robert Louis Stevenson, a Scotchman by birth, who,  owing to ill-health, became a world traveler. During his travels he  visited the United States, spending a year among our famous resorts.  Later he visited Australia and the South Sea Islands, which climate  agreed with him to such an extent that he finally settled down and  made his home on the island of Samoa. He continued his travels from  that point, often visiting the Hawaiian Islands, Australia and New  Zealand. He formed a strong friendship for the natives of Samoa, and  did a great deal to improve their conditions. He died on the island,  and at his own request was buried on the top of one of its beautiful  mountains, with the following lines upon his tomb:        _Here he lies, where he longed to be;      Home is the Sailor, home from the sea,      And the hunter home from the hill._    [Illustration]            CONTENTS    [Illustration]         BED IN SUMMER       YOUNG NIGHT THOUGHT       PIRATE STORY       FAREWELL TO THE FARM       THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE       FAIRY BREAD       ESCAPE AT BEDTIME       A GOOD PLAY       MARCHING SONG       WHERE GO THE BOATS       THE HAYLOFT       AUNTIE'S SKIRTS       THE MOON       THE COW       FOREIGN LANDS       SYSTEM       AT THE SEASIDE       HAPPY THOUGHT       THE LAND OF NOD       WINDY NIGHTS       TIME TO RISE       RAIN       FOREIGN CHILDREN       LOOKING FORWARD       MY SHADOW       THE SUN'S TRAVELS       LOOKING-GLASS RIVER       THE LAMPLIGHTER       SINGING       TRAVEL       MY BED IS A BOAT       KEEPSAKE MILL       THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE       MY SHIP AND I       THE WIND       A GOOD BOY       GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN       PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER       THE SWING       A THOUGHT       ARMIES IN THE FIRE       MY KINGDOM       SHADOW MARCH       WINTER-TIME       THE LITTLE LAND       IN PORT       NIGHT AND DAY       NEST EGGS       THE FLOWERS       FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE       MY TREASURES       BLOCK CITY       THE GARDENER          A CHILD'S GARDEN of VERSES    [Illustration]    BED IN SUMMER          In winter I get up at night,      And dress by yellow candle light.      In summer quite the other way,      I have to go to bed by day.        I have to go to bed and see      The birds still hopping on the tree,      Or hear the grown-up people's feet,      Still going past me in the street.    [Illustration]        And does it not seem hard to you,      When all the sky is clear and blue,      And I should like so much to play,      To have to go to bed by day?          YOUNG NIGHT THOUGHT          All night long and every night,      When my mamma puts out the light      I see the people marching by,      As plain as day, before my eye.        Armies and emperors and kings,      All carrying different kinds of things,      And marching in so grand a way,      You never saw the like by day.        So fine a show was never seen      At the great circus on the green;      For every kind beast and man      Is marching in that caravan.        At first they move a little slow,      But still the faster on they go,      And still beside them close I keep      Until we reach the Town of Sleep.    [Illustration]          PIRATE STORY          Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing.      Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea.      Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,      And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.        Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,        Wary of the weather and steering by a star?      Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,        To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar?        Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--        Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!      Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,      The wicket is the harbor and the garden is the shore.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          FAREWELL TO THE FARM          The coach is at the door at last;      The eager children, mounting fast      And kissing hands, in chorus sing:      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!        To house and garden, field and lawn,      The meadow-gates we swung upon,      To pump and stable, tree and swing,      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!        And fare you well for evermore,      O ladder at the hayloft door,      O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!        Crack goes the whip, and off we go;      The trees and houses smaller grow;      Last, round the woody turn we swing:      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE          When I was sick and lay a-bed,      I had two pillows at my head,      And all my toys beside me lay      To keep me happy all the day.        And sometimes for an hour or so      I watched my leaden soldiers go,      With different uniforms and drills,      Among the bed-clothes, through the hills.        And sometimes sent my ships in fleets      All up and down among the sheets;      Or brought my trees and houses out,      And planted cities all about.        I was the giant great and still      That sits upon the pillow-hill,      And sees before him, dale and plain      The pleasant Land of Counterpane.    [Illustration]        Come up here, O dusty feet!        Here is fairy bread to eat        Here in my retiring room,        Children, you may dine        On the golden smell of broom        And the shade of pine        And when you have eaten well,        Fairy stories hear and tell.    [Illustration]          ESCAPE AT BEDTIME          The lights from the parlor and kitchen shone out        Through the blinds and the windows and bars;      And high over head and all moving about,        There were thousands of millions of stars.      There ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree,        Nor of people in church or the Park,      As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me,        And that glittered and winked in the dark.        The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter and all,        And the star of the sailor, and Mars,      These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall        Would be half full of water and stars.      They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,        And they soon had me packed into bed;      But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,      And the stars going round in my head.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          A GOOD PLAY          We built a ship upon the stairs      All made of the back-bedroom chairs,      And filled it full of sofa pillows      To go a-sailing on the billows.        We took a saw and several nails,      And water in the nursery pails;      And Tom said, \"Let us also take      An apple and a slice of cake;\"--      Which was enough for Tom and me      To go a-sailing on, till tea.        We sailed along for days and days,      And had the very best of plays;      But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,      So there was no one left but me.    [Illustration]          MARCHING SONG          Bring the comb and play upon it!        Marching, here we come!      Willie cocks his highland bonnet,        Johnnie beats the drum.        Mary Jane commands the party,        Peter leads the rear;      Feet in time, alert and hearty,        Each a Grenadier!        All in the most martial manner        Marching double-quick;      While the napkin like a banner        Waves upon the stick!        Here's enough of fame and pillage,        Great commander Jane!      Now that we've been round the village,        Let's go home again.    [Illustration: \"_Boats of mine a-boating_\"]          WHERE GO THE BOATS?          Dark brown is the river,          Golden is the sand.      It flows along for ever,          With trees on either hand.        Green leaves a-floating,          Castles of the foam,      Boats of mine a-boating--          Where will all come home?        On goes the river          And out past the mill,      Away down the valley,          Away down the hill.        Away down the river,          A hundred miles or more,      Other little children          Shall bring my boats ashore.          THE HAYLOFT          Through all the pleasant meadow-side        The grass grew shoulder-high,      Till the shining scythes went far and wide        And cut it down to dry.        These green and sweetly smelling crops        They led in wagons home;      And they piled them here in mountain-tops        For mountaineers to roam.        Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail,        Mount Eagle and Mount High;--      The mice that in these mountains dwell,        No happier are than I!        O what a joy to clamber there,        O what a place for play,      With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,        The happy hills of hay!    [Illustration]          AUNTIE'S SKIRTS          Whenever Auntie moves around        Her dresses make a curious sound.      They trail behind her up the floor,        And trundle after through the door.
