The day on which Jesus Christ died is plainly distinguishable, but the  day of His birth is open to very much question, and, literally, is  only conjectural; so that the 25th December must be taken purely as  the day on which His birth is celebrated, and not as His absolute  natal day. In this matter we can only follow the traditions of the  Church, and tradition alone has little value.    In the second and early third centuries of our aera, we only know that  the festivals, other than Sundays and days set apart for the  remembrance of particular martyrs, were the Passover, Pentecost, and  the Epiphany, the baptism or manifestation of our Lord, when came \"a  voice from Heaven saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well  pleased.\" This seems always to have been fixed for the 6th of January,  and with it was incorporated the commemoration of His birth.

[_All rights reserved_]         Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.              At the Ballantyne Press          PREFACE    TO THE RE-ISSUE OF 1880.      The title of this book,--or, more accurately, of its subject;--for no  author was ever less likely than I have lately become, to hope for  perennial pleasure to his readers from what has cost himself the most  pains,--will be, perhaps, recognised by some as the last clause of the  line chosen from Keats by the good folks of Manchester, to be written in  letters of gold on the cornice, or Holy rood, of the great Exhibition  which inaugurated the career of so many,--since organized, by both  foreign governments and our own, to encourage the production of works of  art, which the producing nations, so far from intending to be their \"joy  for ever,\" only hope to sell as soon as possible. Yet the motto was  chosen with uncomprehended felicity: for there never was, nor can be,  any essential beauty possessed by a work of art, which is not based on  the conception of its honoured permanence, and local influence, as a  part of appointed and precious furniture, either in the cathedral, the  house, or the joyful thoroughfare, of nations which enter their gates  with thanksgiving, and their courts with praise.    \"Their\" courts--or \"His\" courts;--in the mind of such races, the  expressions are synonymous: and the habits of life which recognise the  delightfulness, confess also the sacredness, of homes nested round the  seat of a worship unshaken by insolent theory: themselves founded on an  abiding affection for the past, and care for the future; and approached  by paths open only to the activities of honesty, and traversed only by  the footsteps of peace.    The exposition of these truths, to which I have given the chief energy  of my life, will be found in the following pages first undertaken  systematically and in logical sequence; and what I have since written on  the political influence of the Arts has been little more than the  expansion of these first lectures, in the reprint of which not a  sentence is omitted or changed.    The supplementary papers added contain, in briefest form, the aphorisms  respecting principles of art-teaching of which the attention I gave to  this subject during the continuance of my Professorship at Oxford  confirms me in the earnest and contented re-assertion.    JOHN RUSKIN,    BRANTWOOD,    _April 29th, 1880._          PREFACE    TO THE 1857 EDITION.      The greater part of the following treatise remains in the exact form in  which it was read at Manchester; but the more familiar passages of it,  which were trusted to extempore delivery, have been written with greater  explicitness and fulness than I could give them in speaking; and a  considerable number of notes are added, to explain the points which  could not be sufficiently considered in the time I had at my disposal in  the lecture room.    Some apology may be thought due to the reader, for an endeavour to  engage his attention on a subject of which no profound study seems  compatible with the work in which I am usually employed. But profound  study is not, in this case, necessary either to writer or readers,  while accurate study, up to a certain point, is necessary for us all.  Political economy means, in plain English, nothing more than \"citizen's  economy\"; and its first principles ought, therefore, to be understood by  all who mean to take the responsibility of citizens, as those of  household economy by all who take the responsibility of householders.  Nor are its first principles in the least obscure: they are, many of  them, disagreeable in their practical requirements, and people in  general pretend that they cannot understand, because they are unwilling  to obey them: or rather, by habitual disobedience, destroy their  capacity of understanding them. But there is not one of the really great  principles of the science which is either obscure or disputable,--which  might not be taught to a youth as soon as he can be trusted with an  annual allowance, or to a young lady as soon as she is of age to be  taken into counsel by the housekeeper.    I might, with more appearance of justice, be blamed for thinking it  necessary to enforce what everybody is supposed to know. But this fault  will hardly be found with me, while the commercial events recorded daily  in our journals, and still more the explanations attempted to be given  of them, show that a large number of our so-called merchants are as  ignorant of the nature of money as they are reckless, unjust, and  unfortunate in its employment.    The statements of economical principles given in the text, though I know  that most, if not all, of them are accepted by existing authorities on  the science, are not supported by references, because I have never read  any author on political economy, except Adam Smith, twenty years ago.  Whenever I have taken up any modern book upon this subject, I have  usually found it encumbered with inquiries into accidental or minor  commercial results, for the pursuit of which an ordinary reader could  have no leisure, and by the complication of which, it seemed to me, the  authors themselves had been not unfrequently prevented from seeing to  the root of the business.    Finally, if the reader should feel induced to blame me for too sanguine  a statement of future possibilities in political practice, let him  consider how absurd it would have appeared in the days of Edward I. if  the present state of social economy had been then predicted as  necessary, or even described as possible. And I believe the advance from  the days of Edward I. to our own, great as it is confessedly, consists,  not so much in what we have actually accomplished, as in what we are now  enabled to conceive.

THE DISCOVERY AND APPLICATION OF ART.    _A Lecture delivered at Manchester, July 10, 1857._      1. Among the various characteristics of the age in which we live, as  compared with other ages of this not yet _very_ experienced world, one  of the most notable appears to me to be the just and wholesome contempt  in which we hold poverty. I repeat, the _just_ and _wholesome_ contempt;  though I see that some of my hearers look surprised at the expression. I  assure them, I use it in sincerity; and I should not have ventured to  ask you to listen to me this evening, unless I had entertained a  profound respect for wealth--true wealth, that is to say; for, of  course, we ought to respect neither wealth nor anything else that is  false of its kind: and the distinction between real and false wealth is  one of the points on which I shall have a few words presently to say to  you. But true wealth I hold, as I said, in great honour; and sympathize,  for the most part, with that extraordinary feeling of the present age  which publicly pays this honour to riches.      2. I cannot, however, help noticing how extraordinary it is, and how  this epoch of ours differs from all bygone epochs in having no  philosophical nor religious worshippers of the ragged godship of  poverty. In the classical ages, not only were there people who  voluntarily lived in tubs, and who used gravely to maintain the  superiority of tub-life to town-life, but the Greeks and Latins seem to  have looked on these eccentric, and I do not scruple to say, absurd  people, with as much respect as we do upon large capitalists and landed  proprietors; so that really, in those days, no one could be described as  purse proud, but only as empty-purse proud. And no less distinct than  the honour which those curious Greek people pay to their conceited poor,  is the disrespectful manner in which they speak of the rich; so that  one cannot listen long either to them, or to the Roman writers who  imitated them, without finding oneself entangled in all sorts of  plausible absurdities; hard upon being convinced of the uselessness of  collecting that heavy yellow substance which we call gold, and led  generally to doubt all the most established maxims of political economy.      3.
