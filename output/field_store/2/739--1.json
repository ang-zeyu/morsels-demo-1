HARPER      Privately Printed    At The Riverside Press    Cambridge      BOSTON    MDCDIV    COPYRIGHT 1904 BY H. H. HARPER    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED          PREFATORY      HAVING been asked to make a few remarks upon Book-loving, Book-buying,  and Book Clubs,--not for publication before the great audience of  readers, but for the exclusive use of the members of a private Book  Club,--I venture thus to offer my views, hoping that in the light of  my own personal experience I may be able to give a few useful hints  and suggestions to those who may peruse the pages which follow.    If this little tome, in which are recorded the reflections of one who  for many years has mingled with publishers, booksellers, bibliophiles,  collectors, and bibliomaniacs, should prove to be of any interest or  service, and is found worthy of a small space in some sequestered nook  in the library, where it may in silent repose behold its more worthy  and resplendent companions, the fondest ambition of the author will be  gratified beyond peradventure.    THE AUTHOR.          BOOKLOVERS, BIBLIOMANIACS    AND    BOOK CLUBS      BOOK-collecting is undeniably one of the most engaging pursuits in  which a refined and artistic taste may be indulged. From the earliest  times, and even before the days of printing, this pleasant diversion  has been pursued by persons of moderate means as well as by those of  wealth and distinction, and every succeeding generation of  book-collectors has exceeded its predecessors in numbers and in  enthusiasm. The alluring influences of bibliophilism, or book-loving,  have silently crept into thousands of homes, whether beautiful or  humble; for the library is properly regarded as one of the most  important features of home as well as mental equipment.    In _The House Beautiful_ William C. Gannett emphasizes the importance  of considering the library as foremost in furnishing a home. He says:  \"It means admission to the new marvels of science, if one chooses  admission. It means an introduction to the noblest company that all  the generations have produced, if we claim the introduction.  Remembering this, how can one help wishing to furnish his house with  some such furniture? A poet for a table piece! A philosopher upon the  shelf! Browning or Emerson for a fireside friend!    \"A family's rank in thought and taste can well be gauged by the books  and papers that lie upon the shelf or table of the library.\"    Not many years ago, Mr. Howard Pyle said: \"I sometimes think that we  are upon the edge of some new era in which the art of beautifying  books with pictures shall suddenly be uplifted into a higher and a  different plane of excellence; when ornate printed colour and perfect  reproduction shall truly depict the labour of the patient draughtsman  who strives so earnestly to beautify the world in which he lives, and  to lend a grace to the living therein.\" The prophecy is already  fulfilled, and a modern book, in order to win favor among present-day  bibliophiles, must embody an harmonious assimilation of many arts.    The ardor of possessing books, commonly called bibliomania, also  styled bibliophilism and \"biblio\"--whatever else that has suggested  itself to the fruitful imaginations of dozens of felicitous writers  upon the subject,--is described by Dibdin as a \"disease which grows  with our growth, and strengthens with our strength.\" Kings and queens  have not been immune from this prevalent though harmless malady. The  vast resources of Henry VII were employed in collecting a library of  which a modern millionaire collector might be justly proud. Many  specimens of his magnificent collection, bearing the royal stamp, are  now to be found in the British Museum. Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane  Grey were submissive victims of the bibliomania. It is worthy of note  that while there were but few women book-collectors in the Elizabethan  period, there are at the present time in our own country almost as  many women as there are men engaged in this fascinating pursuit. As  late as 1843, Dibdin remarks that \"it is a remarkable circumstance,  that the bibliomania has almost uniformly confined its attacks to the  _male_ sex, and among people in the higher and middling classes of  society. It has raged chiefly in palaces, castles, halls, and gay  mansions, and those things which in general are supposed not to be  inimical to health,--such as cleanliness, spaciousness, and splendour,  are only so many inducements to the introduction and propagation of  the bibliomania!\"    It should be remembered, however, that one possessing a fondness for  books is not necessarily a bibliomaniac. There is as much difference  between the inclinations and taste of a bibliophile and a bibliomaniac  as between a slight cold and the advanced stages of consumption. Some  one has said that \"to call a bibliophile a bibliomaniac is to conduct  a lover, languishing for his maiden's smile, to an asylum for the  demented, and to shut him up in the ward for the incurables.\" _Biblio_  relates to books, and _mania_ is synonymous with madness, insanity,  violent derangement, mental aberration, etc. A bibliomaniac,  therefore, might properly be called an insane or crazy bibliophile. It  is, however, a harmless insanity, and even in its worst stages it  injures no one. Rational treatment may cure a bibliomaniac and bring  him (or her) back into the congenial folds of bibliophilism, unless,  perchance, the victim has passed beyond the curative stages into the  vast and dreamy realms of extra-illustrating, or \"grangerizing.\"  People usually have a horror of insane persons, and one might well  beware of indulging a taste for books, if there were any reasonable  probability that this would lead to mental derangement. There could be  furniture-maniacs, rug-maniacs, and china-maniacs just as well as  book-maniacs, but people do not generally hesitate to purchase  furniture, rugs, and china for fear of going crazy on the subject, and  no more reason is there why rational persons should hesitate to make a  collection of good books for a library, for fear of being called  bibliomaniacs. In _Sesame and Lilies_ Ruskin says: \"If a man spends  lavishly on his library, you call him mad--a bibliomaniac. But you  never call one a horse-maniac, though men ruin themselves every day by  their horses, and you do not hear of people ruining themselves by  their books.\"    This is preeminently the age of collectors, and scarcely a week passes  without the discovery of some new dementia in this direction. Only a  few days ago I read of a new delirium which threatens disaster to the  feline progeny; it may be called the _cat-tail mania_, seeing that its  victims possess an insatiable desire for amputating and preserving the  caudal appendages of all the neighborhood cats. A self-confessed  member of this cult was recently arrested in one of the eastern  States.    There are several species of bibliophiles; there are _many_ species  of bibliomaniacs. Some admire books for what they contain; others for  their beautiful type, hand-made paper, artistic illustrations, ample  margins, untrimmed edges, etc.; and there are others who attach more  importance to the limited number of copies issued than to either the  contents or workmanship.    If a book is to attain any considerable commercial value and increase  in worth year after year, it is of first importance that the number of  copies issued be actually limited; and the greater the restriction the  more likelihood that the monetary value will be steadily enhanced. But  it must not be forgotten that the mere \"limitation\" will not of itself  create a furore among judicious book-buyers; the book, or set of  books, should rest upon some more secure basis of valuation than that  of scarcity.    Dibdin says in his _Bibliomania_, issued in 1811: \"About twelve years  ago I was rash enough to publish a small volume of poems, with my name  affixed. They were the productions of my juvenile years; and I need  hardly say at this period how ashamed I am of their authorship. The  monthly and analytical reviews did me the kindness of just tolerating  them, and of warning me not to commit any future trespass upon the  premises of Parnassus. I struck off five hundred copies, and was glad  to get rid of half of them as wastepaper; the remaining half has been  partly destroyed by my own hands, and has partly mouldered away in  oblivion amidst the dust of booksellers' shelves. My only consolation  is that the volume is _exceedingly rare_!\"    The contents, first to be considered, should be worthy of  preservation; next in importance is the selection of appropriate type,  and the size and style of page, which should be determined by the nature  of the work and the period in which it was written. The size of the book  and the margins of the page must be carefully considered in order to  harmonize with the text-page. In choosing illustrations it is important  to determine whether they should be ornate and illustrative, or classic  and emblematical in design. The paper should be handmade, to order, and  of such correct size as not to lose the deckle edges in cutting; and the  printing should be done in \"forms\" of not more than eight. The paper  should be scientifically moistened before printing, and the ink allowed  several weeks in which to dry before handling the printed sheets. The  bindings should harmonize with interiors, and due care taken against  over-decoration of the covers. These few technical hints will serve to  acquaint the book-lover with some at least of the many important  features which must be regarded in the preparation of a fine book,--a  book fitted to demand and merit a place upon the library shelves of  discriminating"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#1)"],[1,"http://www.eBookForge.net                  +------------------------------------------------------------+      | Transcriber's Note:                                        |      |                                                            |      | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in        |      | this text.

LIBRARIAN OF BROWN UNIVERSITY    BOSTON  THE BOSTON BOOK COMPANY  1917    _Copyright, 1916,_  BY THE BOSTON BOOK COMPANY    THE UNIVERSITY PRESS, CAMBRIDGE, U. S. A.      TO  THE AUTHORS AND THEIR PRINTERS  WHO HAVE GIVEN US  THE BOOKS THAT WE LOVE          PREFATORY NOTE      The following chapters were written during a series of years as one  aspect after another of the Book engaged the writer's attention. As they  are now brought together, the result is not a systematic treatise, but  rather a succession of views of one many-sided subject. In consequence  there is considerable overlapping. The writer hopes, however, that this  will be looked upon not as vain repetition but as a legitimate  reinforcement of his underlying theme, the unity in diversity of the  Book and the federation of all who have to do with it. He therefore  offers the present volume not so much for continuous reading as for  reading by chapters. He trusts that for those who may consult it in  connection with systematic study a sufficient clue to whatever it may  contain on any given topic will be found in the index.    Most of these chapters appeared as papers in \"The Printing Art\"; two  were published in \"The Graphic Arts,\" and some in other magazines. The  writer expresses his thanks to the proprietors of these periodicals for  the permission to republish the articles in their present collective  form. All the papers have been revised to some extent. They were  originally written in rare moments of leisure scattered through the busy  hours of a librarian. Their writing was a source of pleasure, and their  first publication brought him many delightful associations. As they are  presented in their new attire to another group of readers, their author  can wish for them no better fortune than to meet--possibly to  make--booklovers.

He prizes not  only the soul of the book, but also its body, which he would make a  house beautiful, meet for the indwelling of the spirit given by its  author. Love is not too strong a word to apply to his regard, which  demands, in the language of Dorothy Wordsworth, \"a beautiful book, a  book to caress--peculiar, distinctive, individual: a book that hath  first caught your eye and then pleased your fancy.\" The truth is that  the book on its physical side is a highly organized art object. Not in  vain has it transmitted the thought and passion of the ages; it has  taken toll of them, and in the hands of its worthiest makers these  elements have worked themselves out into its material body. Enshrining  the artist's thought, it has, therefore, the qualities of a true art  product, and stands second only to those which express it, such as  painting and sculpture; but no other art product of its own order, not  the violin nor the jewel-casket, can compare with the book in esthetic  quality. It meets one of the highest tests of art, for it can appeal to  the senses of both beauty and grandeur, either separately, as in the  work of Aldus and of Sweynheym and Pannartz, or together, as in that of  Jenson.    Books have doubtless had their lovers in all ages, under all their  forms. Even the Assyrian clay tablet, if stamped with the words of poet  or sage, might have shared the affection which they inspired. So might  the papyrus roll of the Egyptian, and so does even to-day the parchment  book of the middle ages, whenever its fortunate owner has the soul of a  booklover. From this book our own was derived, yet not without a break.  For our book is not so much a copy of the Roman and medieval book as a  \"substitute\" for it, a machine product made originally to sell at a  large profit for the price of hand-work. It was fortunate for the early  printed book that it stood in this intimate if not honored relation to  the work of the scribes and illuminators, and fortunate for the book of  to-day, since, with all its lapses, it cannot escape its heritage of  those high standards.    Mr. John Cotton Dana has analyzed the book into forty elements; a  minuter analysis might increase the number to sixty; but of either  number the most are subsidiary, a few controlling. The latter are those  of which each, if decided upon first, determines the character of the  rest; they include size, paper, and type. The mention of any size,  folio, quarto, octavo, twelvemo, sixteenmo, calls up at once a distinct  mental picture of an ideal book for each dimension, and the series is  marked by a decreasing thickness of paper and size of type as it  progresses downward from the folio. The proportions of the page will  also vary, as well as the surface of the paper and the cut of the type,  the other elements conforming to that first chosen.    Next to size, paper determines the expression of a book. It is the  printing material par excellence; but for its production the art could  never have flourished. It is as much preferred by the printer as  parchment was by the scribe. Its three elements of body, surface, and  tint must all be considered, and either body or surface may determine  the size of the book or the character of the type. A smooth surface may  be an element of beauty, as with the paper employed by Baskerville, but  it must not be a shiny surface. The great desideratum in modern paper  from the point of view of the book-buyer is a paper that, while opaque  and tough, shall be thin enough to give us our books in small compass,  one more akin to the dainty and precious vellum than to the heavier and  coarser parchment. It should also be durable.    Type gives its name to the art and is the instrument by which the spoken  word is made visible to the eye. The aims in its design should be  legibility, beauty, and compactness, in this order; but these are more  or less conflicting qualities, and it is doubtful if any one design can  surpass in all. Modern type is cleaner-cut than the old, but it may be  questioned whether this is a real gain. William Morris held that all  types should avoid hair-lines, fussiness, and ugliness. Legibility  should have the right of way for most printed matter, especially  children's books and newspapers. If the latter desire compactness, they  should condense their style, not their types.    A further important element, which affects both the legibility and the  durability of the book, is the ink. For most purposes it should be a  rich black. Some of the print of the early masters is now brown, and  there have been fashions of gray printing, but the booklover demands  black ink, except in ornaments, and there color, if it is to win his  favor, must be used sparingly and with great skill. We are told that the  best combination for the eye is ink of a bluish tint on buff-tinted  paper; but, like much other good advice, this remains practically  untried.    Illustrations have been a feature of the book for over four hundred  years, but they have hardly yet become naturalized within its pages. Or  shall we say that they soon forgot their proper subordination to the  type and have since kept up a more or less open revolt? The law of  fitness demands that whatever is introduced into the book in connection  with type shall harmonize with the relatively heavy lines of type. This  the early black-line engravings did. But the results of all other  processes, from copper-plate to half-tone,"]]]
