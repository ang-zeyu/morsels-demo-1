Am I a miserable       egotist, possessed of stupid vanity? It matters not, but of this I       feel positive; yes, as positive as that I live, and this is, my       \"Tristan and Isolde,\" with which I am now consumed, does not find       its equal in the world's library of music. Oh, how I yearn to hear       it; I am feverish; I am worn. Perhaps that causes me to be agitated       and anxious, but my \"Tristan\" has been finished now these three       years and has not been heard. When I think of this I wonder whether       it will be with this as with \"Lohengrin,\" which now is thirteen       years old, and is still dead to me. But the clouds seem breaking,       they are breaking--I am going to Vienna soon. There they are going       to give me a surprise. It is supposed to be kept a secret from me,       but a friend has informed me that they are going to bring out       \"Lohengrin.\"         --_Wagner in a Letter to Praeger_      RICHARD WAGNER    Absurd and silly people make jokes about mothers-in-law, stepmothers and  stepfathers--we will none of this. My heart warms to the melancholy  Jacques, who dedicated his book to his mother-in-law, \"my best friend,  who always came when she was needed and never left so long as there was  work to do.\" Richard Wagner's stepfather was his patient, loving and  loyal friend.    The father of Wagner died when the child was six months old. The mother,  scarcely turned thirty, had a brood of seven, no money and many debts.  There is trouble for you--ye silken, perfumed throng, who nibble  cheese-straws, test the hyson when it is red, and discuss the  heartrending aspects of the servant-girl problem to the lascivious  pleasings of a lute!    But the widow Wagner was not cast down to earth--she resolved on keeping  her family together, caring for them all as best she could. The  suggestion from certain kinsmen that the children should be given out  for adoption was quickly vetoed. The fine spirit of the woman won the  admiration of a worthy actor, in slightly reduced circumstances, who had  lodgings in the house of the widow. This actor, Ludwig Geyer by name,  loved the widow and all of the brood, and he proposed that they pool  their poverty.    And so before Mrs. Wagner had been a widow a twelvemonth they were  married.    In this marriage Geyer seemed to be moved to a degree by the sentiment  of friendship for his friend, the deceased husband. Geyer was a man of  many virtues--amiable, hopeful, kind. He had the artistic temperament  without its faults. To writers of novels, in search of a very choice  central character, Ludwig Geyer affords great possibilities. He was as  hopeful as Triplett and a deal more versatile. The histrionic art  afforded him his income of eleven dollars a week; but painting was his  forte--if he only had time to devote to the technique! Yet all the arts  being one he had written a play; he also modeled in clay and sang tenor  parts as understudy to the great Schudenfeldt. Hope, good-cheer and a  devotion to art were the distinguishing features of Mein Herr Geyer.    All this was in the city of Leipzig; but Herr Geyer becoming a member of  the Court Theater, the family moved to Dresden, where at this time lived  one Weber, a composer, who used to walk by the Geyer home and  occasionally stop in for a little rest. At such times one of the  children would be sent out with a pitcher, and the great composer and  Herr Geyer would in fancy roam the realm of art, and Herr Geyer would  impart to Herr Weber valuable ideas that had never been used. The little  boy, Richard, used to cherish these visits of Weber, and would sit and  watch for hours for the coming of the queer old man in the long gray  cloak.    The stork, one fine day, brought Richard a little sister. He was scarce  two years older than she. These two sort of grew up together, and were  ever the special pets of Herr Geyer, who used to take them to the  theater and seat them on a bench in the wings where they could watch him  lead the assault in \"The Pirate's Revenge.\"    Richard regarded his stepfather with all the affection that ever a child  had for its own parent; and until he was twenty-one was known to the  world as Richard Wilhelm Geyer.    The comparison of Ludwig Geyer with Triplett is hardly fair, for Geyer's  fine effervescence and hopeful, rainbow-chasing qualities were confined  to early life.    As the years passed Geyer settled down to earnest work and achieved a  considerable success both as an actor and as a painter. The unselfish  quality of the man is shown in that his income was freely used to  educate the Wagner children. He was sure that Richard had the germ of  literary ability in his mental make-up, and his ambition was that the  boy should become a writer. But alas! Geyer did not live long enough to  know the true greatness of this child he had fostered and befriended.    Unlike so many musicians Richard was not precocious. He was slow,  thoughtful and philosophic; and music did not attract him so much as  letters. Incidentally he took lessons in music with his other studies,  and his first teacher, Gottlieb Muller, has left on record the statement  that the boy was \"self-willed and eccentric, and not fluid enough in  spirit to succeed in music.\"    The mother of Wagner seems to have been a woman of marked mentality--not  especially musical or poetic, but possessing a fine appreciation of all  good things, and best of all, she had commonsense. She very early came  to regard Richard as her most promising child, and before he was ten  years of age, said to a friend, \"Richard will be able to succeed at  anything he concentrates his mind upon.\"    The truth of the remark has often been reiterated. The youth was superb  in his mental equipment--strong, capable, independent. Had he turned his  attention to any other profession, or any branch of art or science, he  could have probed the problem to its depths, and made his mark upon the  age in which he lived.    In height Wagner was a little under size, but his deep chest, well-set  neck, and large, shapely head gave him a commanding look. In physique he  resembled the \"big little men\" like Columbus, Napoleon, Aaron Burr,  Alexander Hamilton and John Bright--men born to command, with ability to  do the thinking for a nation.    It's magnificent to be a great musician, and many musicians are nothing  else, but it is better to be a man than a musician. Richard Wagner was a  man. Environment forced literature upon his attention: he desired to be  a great poet. He wrote essays, stories, quatrains, epics. Chance sent  the work of Beethoven within his radius, and he became filled with the  melody of the master. Young men of this type, full of the pride of  youth, overflowing with energy, search for a something on which to try  their steel. Wagner could write poetry, that was sure, and more, he  could prepare the score and set his words to music. He fell upon the  work like one possessed--and he was. To his amazement the difficulties  of music all faded away, and that which before seemed like a hopeless  task, now became luminous before the heat of his spirit.    Nothing is difficult when you put your heart in it.    The obstacles to be overcome in setting words to sounds were like a game  of chess--a pleasing diversion. In a month he knew as much of the  science of music as many men did who had grubbed at the work a lifetime.  \"The finances! Get your principles right and then 'tis a mere matter of  detail, requiring only concentration--I will arrange it,\" said Napoleon.    Wagner focused on music, yet here seems a good place to say that he  never learned either to play the piano or to sing. He had to trust the  \"details\" to others. Yet at twenty he led an orchestra. Soon after he  became conductor of the opera at Magdeburg.    In some months more he drifted to Konigsberg, and there acted as  conductor at the Royal Theater. In the company of this theater was a  young woman by the name of Wilhelmina Planer. Wagner got acquainted with  her across the footlights. She was young, comely and all that--they  became engaged. Shortly afterwards, one fine moonlight night, in  response to her merry challenge, they rang up the \"Dom\" and were  married. They got better acquainted afterward.           *       *       *       *       *    It is a fact that Wagner's imprudent marriage at the age of twenty-three  has been much regretted and oft lamented. \"What,\" say the Impressionable  Ones, \"Oh, what could he not have accomplished with a proper mate!\"    It is very true that Minna Planer had no comprehension of the genius of  her husband; that her two feet were always flatly planted on earth, and  her head never reached the clouds; and true it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this file        which includes the many original illustrations.

THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF WINCHESTER    A Description of Its Fabric and a Brief History of the  Episcopal See    by    PHILIP W. SERGEANT  Late Scholar of Trinity College, Oxford      [Illustration: WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL FROM NORTH-WEST END OF CLOSE.  _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    [Illustration]    With Fifty Illustrations                London George Bell & Sons 1899  First Published, Jan. 1898  Second Edition, Revised 1899    W. H. White and Co. Limited    Riverside Press, Edinburgh          GENERAL PREFACE      This series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the  great English Cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide-books  at a popular price. The aim of each writer has been to produce a work  compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the  student of Archaeology and History, and yet not too technical in  language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case  would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general  sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful  are:--(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in  questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2)  the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the  Transactions of the Antiquarian and Archaeological Societies; (3) the  important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master  of the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the  English Cathedrals; and (5) the very excellent series of Handbooks to  the Cathedrals originated by the late Mr John Murray; to which the  reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in  reference to the histories of the respective sees.

Britton's \"Cathedrals,\" Browne Willis's \"Survey  of the Cathedrals,\" and Woodward's \"History of Hampshire,\" with the more  recent Diocesan History of Winchester by Canon Benham, and the  \"Winchester Cathedral Records\" of various dates, have been of great  service. An article in the _Builder_ of October 1, 1892, and one on St  Cross in _Architecture_ for November 1896, must also be mentioned. Above  all, I am glad to be able to express my gratitude to one of the editors  of this series, Mr Gleeson White, without whose assistance this account  would never have been commenced.
