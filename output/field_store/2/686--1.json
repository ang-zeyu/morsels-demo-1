It was seven o'clock of a gray November morning when we arrived in  Berlin for our first residence abroad. The approach to the city  reminded us of the newer parts of New York, and we found that the  population was about the same. But here the resemblance ceases. New  York is the metropolis of a great nation,--the heart whence arterial  supplies go forth, and to which all returning channels converge; the  cosmopolitan centre of a New World. Berlin is the increasingly  important capital of the German Empire,--growing rapidly, but still  the royal impersonation of Prussia and the Hohenzollerns; seated in  something of mediaeval costume and quiet beside the river Spree; as  content to cast a satisfied glance backward to Frederick the Great and  the Electors of Brandenburg as to look forward to imperial supremacy  among the Great Powers, and the championship of continental Protestant  Europe.    There is one continuous thread woven through the old history and the  new, and this appeared in the first hour of our stay. Everywhere on  the streets the one thing most strange to our American eyes was the  number of striking military uniforms mingled with the more sober garb  of civilians. Officers of fine form and gentlemanly bearing, in  uniforms of dark blue with scarlet trimmings and long, dragging,  rattling swords, were commanding the evolutions of infantry in the  main streets; while frequent glimpses of gold-laced light blue or  scarlet jackets or of plumed and helmeted hussars animated the scene  on the crowded sidewalks. Germany is, as it has been from the  beginning, a military power.    We drove first to the home of an American friend. We were not prepared  for the four long flights of stairs up which we were directed by the  porter on the ground floor. \"What reverses of fortune have come to  A.,\" thought we, \"that she lives in an attic!\" The tenement was a good  one, to be sure, when we found it,--large and lofty apartments with  many windows, commanding a fine view. But to one unused to many  stairs, and weakened by continuous illness in a long sea-voyage, the  exhaustion of that first ascent was something to be remembered. It  was, however, but the precursor of hundreds of similar feats, which  our residence involved, as nearly all families live up several flights  of stairs. Only once did we see an elevator in Germany. In the elegant  hotel known as the Kaiserhof, the sojourning-place of princes,  diplomatists, and statesmen, we took our seats in a commodious  elevator, rejoiced at the thought of such an American way of getting  upstairs. It was fully five minutes before we reached the moderate  elevation of the corridor on which our rooms opened; the liveried and  intelligent official in charge, evidently a personage of importance,  meanwhile replying to our queries and enjoying our evident surprise at  the slow motion, until we forgot our annoyance in the interest of the  conversation which ensued before we reached our destination. Once I  was toiling up the four flights which led to the residence of a  cultivated German lady, in company with the hostess. \"Oh,\" I said  breathlessly, \"would there were elevators in Germany!\"    \"Yes,\" courteously responded the lady; adding, with a resigned sigh,  the conclusive words which indicated contentment with her lot, \"but it  is not ze custom.\"    It was late in the season, and our lodgings were not engaged in  advance. Americans in increasing numbers make Berlin a winter  residence, and by October the most desirable _pensions_ generally have  their rooms engaged. By the kind offices of our friend, our famishing  party were provided with the rolls and coffee which compose the  continental breakfast, and a fortunate entrance was, after much  seeking, obtained for us to a most desirable boarding-house. Our own  apartment was a large corner room, with immense windows looking north  and east, and, like nearly all rooms in Berlin houses, connected by  double doors with the apartments on either side. A fire was built  before we took possession, but it was two days before we ceased to  shiver. We looked for the stove of which we had heard. More than one  of the five senses were called into requisition to determine which  article of furniture was entitled to that designation. Across one  corner of the room stood a tall white monument composed of glazed  tiles laid in mortar, built into the room as a chimney might have  been, with a hidden flue in the rear connecting it with the wall. A  drab cornice and plaster ornaments of the same color set off the four  or five feet above the mantel which surrounded it, and a brass door,  about ten inches by twelve, was in the middle front of the part below.  On the mantel were disposed sundry ornaments, including vases of dried  grasses, and the hand could always be held upon the tiles against  which they stood. In a small fireplace within this unique mass of  tiles and mortar, the housemaid would place a dozen pieces of  coal-cake once or at most twice a day, and after allowing a few  minutes for the kindling to set it aglow, would close and lock the  triple door, and the fire was made for twenty-four hours. In two or  three hours after the lighting of the fire, the temperature of the  room, if other conditions were favorable, might be slightly raised. To  raise it five to ten degrees would require from six to ten hours.    In response to our request to the landlady for an addition of cold  meat or steak to the coffee and rolls of the breakfast, and for more  warmth in the room, accompanied by an expression of willingness to  make additional payment for the same, the reply, given in a courteous  manner, was that Americans lived in rooms much too warm, and ate too  much meat, and that it would be for their health in Germany to conform  to the German customs. However, some spasmodic efforts were made, for  a season, to comply with the requests, which before long were wholly  discontinued; and the strangers learned the wisdom of accommodating  themselves \"in Rome\" to the ways of the Romans. This, however, was not  accomplished without continued suffering. The meagre \"first  breakfast,\" served about half-past eight o'clock, was supplemented by  a \"second breakfast\" of a cup of chocolate or beef tea, at about  eleven, to those who were then in the house and made known their  desire for it. But the days were short. Berlin is about six hundred  miles nearer the north pole than New York, in the latitude of Labrador  and the southern part of Hudson's Bay. The climate is milder only  because the Gulf Stream kindly sends its warmth over all Europe,  which lies in much higher latitudes than we are wont to think.  Consequently the days in winter are much shorter than ours, as in  summer they are longer. All the mid-winter daylight of Berlin is  between the hours of eight A.M. and four P.M. With dinner at two  o'clock, from which we rose about three, there was too little light  remaining for visits to museums and other places of interest, so that  the chief sightseeing of the day must be put into the hours between  nine and two o'clock, often far from residence or restaurants; so the  work of the day must be done on insufficient food, and the prevailing  physical sensation was that of being an animated empty cask. We thus  reached a settled conviction that however well the continental  breakfast may serve the needs of Germans, with their slow ways of  working, and their heavy suppers of sausage, black bread, and beer,  late at night, an American home for Americans temporarily in Berlin is  a consummation much to be wished.    It is almost with a feeling of despair that many a woman "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: \"I'VE COME TO SAY GOOD-BY TO YOU, SIS\"]          THE PRINCESS OF THE SCHOOL  ==================================           By ANGELA BRAZIL  ----------------------------------                AUTHOR OF    \"The Luckiest Girl in the School,\"  \"The Harum-Scarum Schoolgirl,\"  \"A Popular Schoolgirl,\"  \"The Head Girl at the Gables.\"         Illustrated by Frank Wiles.  ==================================          A.

Long before the slightest hint of dawn showed in the sky the lamps  were lighted in the corridors, maids were scuttling about, bringing in  breakfast, and Jones, the gardener, assisted by his eldest boy, a sturdy  grinning urchin of twelve, was beginning the process of carrying down  piles of hand-bags and hold-alls, and stacking them on a cart which was  waiting in the drive outside.    Miss Walters, dreading the Christmas rush on the railway, had determined  to take time by the forelock, and meant to pack off her pupils by the  first available trains, trusting they would most of them reach their  destinations before the overcrowding became a serious problem in the  traffic. The pupils themselves offered no objections to this early  start. The sooner they reached home and began the holidays, so much the  better from their point of view. It was fun to get up by lamp-light,  when the stars were still shining in the sky; fun to find that rules  were relaxed, and for once they might chatter and talk as they pleased;  fun to run unreproved along the passages, sing on the stairs, and twirl  one another round in an impromptu dance in the hall.    The particular occupants of the Blue Bedroom had been astir even before  the big bell clanged for rising, so they stole a march over rival  dormitories, performed their toilets, packed their hand-bags, strapped  their wraps, and proceeded downstairs to the dining-hall, where cups and  plates were just being laid upon the breakfast-table. It was quite  superfluous energy on the part of Lilias, Dulcie, Gowan, and Bertha, for  as a matter of fact not one of them was on the list of earliest  departures, but the excitement of the general exodus had awakened them  as absolutely as the advent of Santa Claus on Christmas mornings. They  stood round the newly-lighted fire, warming their hands, chatting, and  hailing fresh arrivals who hurried into the hall.    \"You going by the 6.30, Edith? You lucker! My train doesn't start till  ten! I begged and implored Miss Walters to let me leave by the early  one, and wait at the junction, but she would not hear of it, so I've got  to stop here kicking my heels, and watch you others whisked away. Isn't  it a grisly shame?\"    Gowan's round rosy face was drawn into a decided pout, and her blue eyes  were full of self-pity. She had to be sorry for her own grievance,  because nobody else had either time or much inclination to sympathize;  they were all far too much excited about their own concerns.    \"Well, you'll get off sometime, I suppose,\" returned Edith airily.  \"There are twelve of us, all going together as far as Colminster. We  mean to cram into one carriage if we can. Don't suppose the train will  be full, as it's so early. I thought you were coming with us, Bertha,  but Miss Hardy says you're not!\"    \"Dad changed his mind at the last minute, and promised to send the car  to fetch me. It's only forty miles by road, you know, though it takes  hours by the train. He seemed to think I should lose either myself or my  luggage at Sheasby Junction, and it is a horrid place to change. You  never can get hold of a porter, and you don't know which platform you'll  start from.\"    \"How are you going home, Lilias?\" asked Noreen, who with several other  girls had joined the group at the fire.    Lilias, squatting on the fender, stretching two cold hands towards the  blazing sticks, looked up brightly.    \"We're riding! Astley and Elton are to fetch Rajah and Peri over for us.  Grandfather said they needed exercise. I don't suppose he'd have thought  of it, only Dulcie wrote to Cousin Clare and begged her to ask him.  Won't it be just splendiferous? We haven't had a ride the whole term,  and I'm pining to see Rajah!\"    \"Grandfather had promised to let us ride to school in September,\" put in  Dulcie, \"but Everard and a friend of his commandeered the horses and  went to Rasebury, so we couldn't have them, and we were so disappointed.  I do hope nothing will happen to stop them this time! Everard was to  arrive home yesterday, so he'll be before us. I shan't ever be friends  with him again if he plays us such a mean trick!\"    \"It's 'coach--carriage--wheelbarrow--truck,' it seems to me, the way  we're all trotting home!\" laughed Edith. \"If I could have my choice, I'd  sprint on a scooter!\"    \"Next term we'll travel by private aeroplane, specially chartered!\"  scoffed Noreen.    \"I don't mind how I go, so long as I get off somehow!\" chirped Truie.  \"Thank goodness, here come the urns at last! I began to think breakfast  would never be ready. We want to have time to eat something before we  start.\"    Miss Walters' excellent arrangements had left ample time for the healthy  young appetites to be satisfied before the taxis arrived at the door to  convey the first contingent of pupils to the station. Sixteen girls,  under the escort of a mistress, took their departure in the highest of  spirits, packed as tightly as sardines, but managing to wave good-bys.  Their boxes had been dispatched the previous day, their hand-bags had  gone on by cart before breakfast and would be waiting for them at the  station, where Jones, that most useful factotum, would, by special  arrangement with the station-master, be taking their tickets before the  ordinary opening of the booking-office.    Though the departure of sixteen girls made somewhat of a clearance at  Chilcombe Hall, Miss Walters' labors were not yet over. There was a  train at eight and a train at ten, and the young people who had to wait  for these found it difficult to know how to employ the interval until it  was their turn to enter the taxis. By nine o'clock Lilias and Dulcie,  ready in their riding habits, were looking eagerly out of the  dining-hall window along the drive which led to the gate.    \"I know Elton would be early,\" said Dulcie. \"It's always Astley who  stops and fusses. It was the same when Everard went cub-hunting. You  don't think there's a hitch, do you?\" (uneasily). \"Shall we get a  horrid yellow envelope and a message to say 'Come by train'? It would be  _too_ bad, and yet, it's as likely as not!\"    Dulcie's fears, which in the course of twenty minutes' waiting and  watching had almost conjured up the telegraph boy with his scarlet  bicycle and brown leather wallet, were suddenly dispelled, however, by a  brisk sound of trotting, and a moment later appeared the welcome sight  of her grandfather's two grooms riding up to the house, each leading a  spare horse by the rein. Those schoolfellows who had not yet departed to  the station came to the door to witness the interesting start. A sleek,  well-groomed horse is always a beautiful object, and the girls decided  unanimously that Lilias and Dulcie were lucky to be carried home in so  delightful a fashion. They watched them admiringly as they mounted.  Edith stroked Rajah's smooth neck as she said good-by to her friends.    \"Riding beats motoring in my opinion,\" she vouchsafed, \"though of course  you can go farther in a car. Perhaps I shall pass you on the road.\"    \"No, you won't, for we're taking a short cut across country. We always  choose by-lanes if we can. Write and tell me if you get a motor-scooter.  They sound fearfully thrillsome. Good-by, see you again in January!\"    \"Good-by! and a merry Christmas to everybody!\" added Dulcie, turning on  her saddle to wave a parting salute to those who were left behind on the  doorstep.    The two girls walked their horses down the drive, but once out on the  level road they trotted on briskly, with the grooms riding behind. They  formed quite a little cavalcade as they turned from the hard motor track  down the grassy lane where a dilapidated sign-post pointed to Ringfield  and Cheverley. It was a distance of seven good country miles from  Chilcombe Hall to Cheverley Chase, and, as the events of this story  center largely round Lilias and Dulcie, there will be ample time to  describe them while they are wending their way through the damp of the  misty December morning, up from the low-lying river level to the hill  country that stretched beyond.    Lilias was just sixteen, and very pretty, with gray eyes, fair hair, a  straight nose,"]]]
