CONTEMPORARY OPINION                                        309          PREFACE      Plain speaking is necessary in any discussion of religion, for if the  freethinker attacks the religious dogmas with hesitation, the orthodox  believer assumes that it is with regret that the freethinker would  remove the crutch that supports the orthodox. And all religious beliefs  are \"crutches\" hindering the free locomotive efforts of an advancing  humanity. There are no problems related to human progress and happiness  in this age which any theology can solve, and which the teachings of  freethought cannot do better and without the aid of encumbrances.    Havelock Ellis has stated that, \"The man who has never wrestled with his  early faith, the faith that he was brought up with and that yet is not  truly his own--for no faith is our own that we have not arduously  won--has missed not only a moral but an intellectual discipline. The  absence of that discipline may mark a man for life and render all his  work ineffective. He has missed a training in criticism, in analysis, in  open-mindedness, in the resolutely impersonal treatment of personal  problems, which no other training can compensate. He is, for the most  part, condemned to live in a mental jungle where his arm will soon be  too feeble to clear away the growths that enclose him, and his eyes too  weak to find the light.\" The man who has allowed his mental capacities  to clear his way through the dense underbrush of religious dogma finds  that he has emerged into a purer and healthier atmosphere. In the  bright light of this mental emancipation a man perceives the falsities  of all religions in their historic, scientific, and metaphysical  aspects. The healthier mental viewpoint holds up to scorn and discards  the reactionary religious philosophy of morals, and the sum total of his  conclusions must be that religion is doomed; and doomed in this modern  day by its absolute irrelevance to the needs and interests of modern  life. And this not only by the steadily increasing army of freethinkers,  but by the indifference and neglect of those who still cling to the fast  slipping folds of religious creeds--- the future freethinkers.    It was Spinoza who remarked that, \"The proper study of a wise man is not  how to die but how to live.\" Religious creeds can but teach how man  should live, so that when he dies, he may be assured of salvation; and  the important thing is not what he does to help his fellow men while he  is living, but how closely he lives in conformity to a reactionary code  of dogmas. Religion has always aimed to smooth the sufferer's passage to  the next world, not to save him for this world.    Freethought has dethroned the gods from the pedestal, and has replaced,  not an empty idol, but an _ideal_, the ideal of a man who is his own  god.    It has become increasingly apparent that what men have hitherto  attributed to the gods are nothing but the ideals they value and grope  for in themselves. The ideal of the freethinker, the conception that  places the supreme worth of human life in the expanding horizon of man's  usefulness to man, is forever menaced by the supernaturalism of the  theist which manifests itself in the multifarious religious sects that  are the most active and constant menace to civilization and to mankind  today. That religion in the past has produced suffering incalculable and  has been the greatest obstacle in the advance of secular knowledge is a  fact too well attested to by history to be denied by any sincere and  unbiased intelligent man. That today it constitutes a cultural lag, an  active menace to the best interests of humanity and the last refuge of  human savagery, is the contention of the freethinker.    The conception of the God-idea as held by society in general stands in  the same position as the vermiform appendix does to the anatomy of man.  It may have been useful in some way thousands of years ago, but today it  constitutes a detriment to the well-being of the individual without  offering any compensatory usefulness. Agree or disagree with this  contention you may, but only when you are made aware of the facts that  can be brought to the aid of this conviction. Just as the fundamental  principle of justice is outraged when a man or an institution is  condemned by jurist or popular opinion when an opportunity is not given  to present the facts on both aspects of the case, just so is no man  justified in making a decision between theism and atheism until he  becomes acquainted with both sides of the controversy. Freethought but  asks a hearing and the exercise of the unbiased reason of the man who  has not hitherto been made aware of its contentions.    In the religious revolution of this twentieth century, the battle ground  is squarely seen to be between supernaturalism and secularism. Although  the supernaturalists are well entrenched and fortified, it is well to  remember that it is the man with vision who finally prevails. The time  has passed when the freethinker could be held up to the community as an  example of a base and degraded individual. No manner of pulpit drivel  can delude even the unthinking masses to this misconception. The  freethinker is today the one who beholds the vision, and this vision  does not transcend the natural. It is a vision that is earth-bound; a  vision it may be called, since it leaps the boundary of the present and  infers for him what the future of a secular organization of the entire  constituency of humanity will bring forth. This vision is but a product  of his scientific armamentarium and is the means by which he is assured  of victory over the well-entrenched and fortified position of the  supernaturalists who are still creed-bound to use antiquated and useless  weapons. The supernaturalist's armamentarium of God, Bible, Heaven,  Hell, Soul, Immortality, Sin, The Fall and Redemption of Man, Prayer,  Creed, and Dogma, leave as much impression on the mind of intelligent  man as would an arrow against a battleship. And the comparison is apt,  the supernaturalists have made full use of force, be it in physical  warfare or in mental coercion. The freethinker has as much use for  physical force and war as he has for mental coercion; both are abhorrent  to him.    _Supernaturalism vs. Secularism_--that, and that alone is the field of  argument. The supernaturalist, be he the fundamentalist of whatever  denomination, or the more advanced modernist, is as tenaciously clinging  to the transcendental, to revelation, to the infallibility of the Bible,  if not in all respects at least in some (although this is a  contradiction _per se_), to the interdisposition of a deity in the  affairs of mankind, as were his ancestors of five hundred years ago.

The light of the table-lamp, softened and  enriched by its mosaic shade, gave an appearance of added opulence to  the already handsome appointments of the room. The little table-clock  ticked merrily from half-past eleven to a quarter to twelve.    Into the cozy, bookish atmosphere of the novelist's study penetrated the  muffled chime of Big Ben; it chimed the three-quarters. But, with his  mind centered upon his work, Leroux wrote on ceaselessly.    An odd figure of a man was this popular novelist, with patchy and  untidy hair which lessened the otherwise striking contour of his brow.  A neglected and unpicturesque figure, in a baggy, neutral-colored  dressing-gown; a figure more fitted to a garret than to this spacious,  luxurious workroom, with the soft light playing upon rank after rank  of rare and costly editions, deepening the tones in the Persian carpet,  making red morocco more red, purifying the vellum and regilding the  gold of the choice bindings, caressing lovingly the busts and statuettes  surmounting the book-shelves, and twinkling upon the scantily-covered  crown of Henry Leroux. The door bell rang.    Leroux, heedless of external matters, pursued his work. But the door  bell rang again and continued to ring.    \"Soames! Soames!\" Leroux raised his voice irascibly, continuing to write  the while. \"Where the devil are you! Can't you hear the door bell?\"    Soames did not reveal himself; and to the ringing of the bell was added  the unmistakable rattling of a letter-box.    \"Soames!\" Leroux put down his pen and stood up. \"Damn it! he's out! I  have no memory!\"    He retied the girdle of his dressing-gown, which had become unfastened,  and opened the study door. Opposite, across the entrance lobby, was  the outer door; and in the light from the lobby lamp he perceived two  laughing eyes peering in under the upraised flap of the letter-box. The  ringing ceased.    \"Are you VERY angry with me for interrupting you?\" cried a girl's voice.    \"My dear Miss Cumberly!\" said Leroux without irritation; \"on the  contrary--er--I am delighted to see you--or rather to hear you. There is  nobody at home, you know.\"...    \"I DO know,\" replied the girl firmly, \"and I know something else, also.  Father assures me that you simply STARVE yourself when Mrs. Leroux is  away! So I have brought down an omelette!\"    \"Omelette!\" muttered Leroux, advancing toward the door; \"you  have--er--brought an omelette! I understand--yes; you have brought an  omelette? Er--that is very good of you.\"    He hesitated when about to open the outer door, raising his hands to his  dishevelled hair and unshaven chin. The flap of the letter-box dropped;  and the girl outside could be heard stifling her laughter.    \"You must think me--er--very rude,\" began Leroux; \"I mean--not to open  the door. But\"...    \"I quite understand,\" concluded the voice of the unseen one. \"You are a  most untidy object! And I shall tell Mira DIRECTLY she returns that she  has no right to leave you alone like this! Now I am going to hurry back  upstairs; so you may appear safely. Don't let the omelette get cold.  Good night!\"    \"No, certainly I shall not!\" cried Leroux. \"So good of you--I--er--do  like omelette.... Good night!\"    Calmly he returned to his writing-table, where, in the pursuit of the  elusive character whose exploits he was chronicling and who had brought  him fame and wealth, he forgot in the same moment Helen Cumberly and the  omelette.    The table-clock ticked merrily on;  SCRATCH--SCRATCH--SPLUTTER--SCRATCH--went Henry Leroux's pen; for this  up-to-date litterateur, essayist by inclination, creator of \"Martin  Zeda, Criminal Scientist\" by popular clamor, was yet old-fashioned  enough, and sufficient of an enthusiast, to pen his work, while lesser  men dictated.    So, amidst that classic company, smiling or frowning upon him from the  oaken shelves, where Petronius Arbiter, exquisite, rubbed shoulders  with Balzac, plebeian; where Omar Khayyam leaned confidentially toward  Philostratus; where Mark Twain, standing squarely beside Thomas Carlyle,  glared across the room at George Meredith, Henry Leroux pursued the  amazing career of \"Martin Zeda.\"    It wanted but five minutes to the hour of midnight, when again the door  bell clamored in the silence.    Leroux wrote steadily on. The bell continued to ring, and, furthermore,  the ringer could be heard beating upon the outer door.    \"Soames!\" cried Leroux irritably, \"Soames! Why the hell don't you go to  the door!\"    Leroux stood up, dashing his pen upon the table.    \"I shall have to sack that damned man!\" he cried; \"he takes too many  liberties--stopping out until this hour of the night!\"    He pulled open the study door, crossed the hallway, and opened the door  beyond.    In, out of the darkness--for the stair lights had been  extinguished--staggered a woman; a woman whose pale face exhibited,  despite the ravages of sorrow or illness, signs of quite unusual beauty.  Her eyes were wide opened, and terror-stricken, the pupils contracted  almost to vanishing point. She wore a magnificent cloak of civet fur  wrapped tightly about her, and, as Leroux opened the door, she tottered  past him into the lobby, glancing back over her shoulder.    With his upraised hands plunged pathetically into the mop of his hair,  Leroux turned and stared at the intruder. She groped as if a darkness  had descended, clutched at the sides of the study doorway, and then,  unsteadily, entered--and sank down upon the big chesterfield in utter  exhaustion.    Leroux, rubbing his chin, perplexedly, walked in after her. He  scarcely had his foot upon the study carpet, ere the woman started up,  tremulously, and shot out from the enveloping furs a bare arm and a  pointing, quivering finger.    \"Close the door!\" she cried hoarsely--\"close the door!... He has...  followed me!\"...    The disturbed novelist, as a man in a dream, turned, retraced his steps,  and closed the outer door of the flat. Then, rubbing his chin more  vigorously than ever and only desisting from this exercise to fumble in  his dishevelled hair, he walked back into the study, whose Athenean calm  had thus mysteriously been violated.    Two minutes to midnight; the most respectable flat in respectable  Westminster; a lonely and very abstracted novelist--and a pale-faced,  beautiful woman, enveloped in costly furs, sitting staring with fearful  eyes straight before her. This was such a scene as his sense of the  proprieties and of the probabilities could never have permitted Henry  Leroux to create.    His visitor kept moistening her dry lips and swallowing, emotionally.    Standing at a discreet distance from her:--    \"Madam,\" began Leroux, nervously.    She waved her hand, enjoining him to silence, and at the same time  intimating that she would explain herself directly speech became  possible. Whilst she sought to recover her composure, Leroux, gradually  forcing himself out of the dreamlike state, studied her with a sort of  anxious curiosity.    It now became apparent to him that his visitor was no more than  twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, but illness or trouble, or both  together, had seared and marred her beauty. Amid the auburn masses of  her hair, gleamed streaks, not of gray, but of purest white. The low  brow was faintly wrinkled, and the big--unnaturally big--eyes were  purple shaded; whilst two heavy lines traced their way from the corner  of the nostrils to the corner of the mouth--of the drooping mouth with  the bloodless lips.    Her pallor became more strange and interesting the longer he studied it;  for, underlying the skin was a yellow tinge which he found inexplicable,  but which he linked in his mind with the contracted pupils of her eyes,  seeking vainly for a common cause.    He had a hazy impression that his visitor, beneath her furs, was most  inadequately clothed; and seeking confirmation of this, his gaze strayed  downward to where one little slippered foot peeped out from the civet  furs.    Leroux suppressed a gasp. He had caught a glimpse of a bare ankle!    He crossed to his writing-table, and seated himself, glancing sideways  at this living mystery. Suddenly she began, in a voice tremulous and  scarcely audible:--    \"Mr. Leroux, at a great--at a very great personal risk, I have come  to-night. What I have to ask of you--to entreat of you, will... will\"...    Two bare arms emerged from the fur, and she began clutching at her  throat and bosom as though choking--dying.    Leroux leapt"]]]
