The jungle moon  dappled an occasional clearing which the great cat was always careful  to avoid. Though he moved through thick verdure across a carpet of  innumerable twigs, broken branches, and leaves, his passing gave forth  no sound that might have been apprehended by dull human ears.    Apparently less cautious was the hunted thing moving even as silently  as the lion a hundred paces ahead of the tawny carnivore, for instead  of skirting the moon-splashed natural clearings it passed directly  across them, and by the tortuous record of its spoor it might indeed be  guessed that it sought these avenues of least resistance, as well it  might, since, unlike its grim stalker, it walked erect upon two  feet--it walked upon two feet and was hairless except for a black  thatch upon its head; its arms were well shaped and muscular; its hands  powerful and slender with long tapering fingers and thumbs reaching  almost to the first joint of the index fingers. Its legs too were  shapely but its feet departed from the standards of all races of men,  except possibly a few of the lowest races, in that the great toes  protruded at right angles from the foot.    Pausing momentarily in the full light of the gorgeous African moon the  creature turned an attentive ear to the rear and then, his head lifted,  his features might readily have been discerned in the moonlight. They  were strong, clean cut, and regular--features that would have attracted  attention for their masculine beauty in any of the great capitals of  the world. But was this thing a man? It would have been hard for a  watcher in the trees to have decided as the lion's prey resumed its way  across the silver tapestry that Luna had laid upon the floor of the  dismal jungle, for from beneath the loin cloth of black fur that  girdled its thighs there depended a long hairless, white tail.    In one hand the creature carried a stout club, and suspended at its  left side from a shoulder belt was a short, sheathed knife, while a  cross belt supported a pouch at its right hip. Confining these straps  to the body and also apparently supporting the loin cloth was a broad  girdle which glittered in the moonlight as though encrusted with virgin  gold, and was clasped in the center of the belly with a huge buckle of  ornate design that scintillated as with precious stones.    Closer and closer crept Numa, the lion, to his intended victim, and  that the latter was not entirely unaware of his danger was evidenced by  the increasing frequency with which he turned his ear and his sharp  black eyes in the direction of the cat upon his trail. He did not  greatly increase his speed, a long swinging walk where the open places  permitted, but he loosened the knife in its scabbard and at all times  kept his club in readiness for instant action.    Forging at last through a narrow strip of dense jungle vegetation the  man-thing broke through into an almost treeless area of considerable  extent. For an instant he hesitated, glancing quickly behind him and  then up at the security of the branches of the great trees waving  overhead, but some greater urge than fear or caution influenced his  decision apparently, for he moved off again across the little plain  leaving the safety of the trees behind him. At greater or less  intervals leafy sanctuaries dotted the grassy expanse ahead of him and  the route he took, leading from one to another, indicated that he had  not entirely cast discretion to the winds. But after the second tree  had been left behind the distance to the next was considerable, and it  was then that Numa walked from the concealing cover of the jungle and,  seeing his quarry apparently helpless before him, raised his tail  stiffly erect and charged.    Two months--two long, weary months filled with hunger, with thirst,  with hardships, with disappointment, and, greater than all, with  gnawing pain--had passed since Tarzan of the Apes learned from the  diary of the dead German captain that his wife still lived. A brief  investigation in which he was enthusiastically aided by the  Intelligence Department of the British East African Expedition revealed  the fact that an attempt had been made to keep Lady Jane in hiding in  the interior, for reasons of which only the German High Command might  be cognizant.    In charge of Lieutenant Obergatz and a detachment of native German  troops she had been sent across the border into the Congo Free State.    Starting out alone in search of her, Tarzan had succeeded in finding  the village in which she had been incarcerated only to learn that she  had escaped months before, and that the German officer had disappeared  at the same time. From there on the stories of the chiefs and the  warriors whom he quizzed, were vague and often contradictory. Even the  direction that the fugitives had taken Tarzan could only guess at by  piecing together bits of fragmentary evidence gleaned from various  sources.    Sinister conjectures were forced upon him by various observations which  he made in the village. One was incontrovertible proof that these  people were man-eaters; the other, the presence in the village of  various articles of native German uniforms and equipment. At great risk  and in the face of surly objection on the part of the chief, the  ape-man made a careful inspection of every hut in the village from  which at least a little ray of hope resulted from the fact that he  found no article that might have belonged to his wife.    Leaving the village he had made his way toward the southwest, crossing,  after the most appalling hardships, a vast waterless steppe covered for  the most part with dense thorn, coming at last into a district that had  probably never been previously entered by any white man and which was  known only in the legends of the tribes whose country bordered it. Here  were precipitous mountains, well-watered plateaus, wide plains, and  vast swampy morasses, but neither the plains, nor the plateaus, nor the  mountains were accessible to him until after weeks of arduous effort he  succeeded in finding a spot where he might cross the morasses--a  hideous stretch infested by venomous snakes and other larger dangerous  reptiles. On several occasions he glimpsed at distances or by night  what might have been titanic reptilian monsters, but as there were  hippopotami, rhinoceri, and elephants in great numbers in and about the  marsh he was never positive that the forms he saw were not of these.    When at last he stood upon firm ground after crossing the morasses he  realized why it was that for perhaps countless ages this territory had  defied the courage and hardihood of the heroic races of the outer world  that had, after innumerable reverses and unbelievable suffering  penetrated to practically every other region, from pole to pole.    From the abundance and diversity of the game it might have appeared  that every known species of bird and beast and reptile had sought here  a refuge wherein they might take their last stand against the  encroaching multitudes of men that had steadily spread themselves over  the surface of the earth, wresting the hunting grounds from the lower  orders, from the moment that the first ape shed his hair and ceased to  walk upon his knuckles.  Even the species with which Tarzan was  familiar showed here either the results of a divergent line of  evolution or an unaltered form that had been transmitted without  variation for countless ages.    Too, there were many hybrid strains, not the least interesting of which  to Tarzan was a yellow and black striped lion. Smaller than the species  with which Tarzan was familiar, but still a most formidable beast,  since it possessed in addition to sharp saber-like canines the  disposition of a devil. To Tarzan it presented evidence that tigers had  once roamed the jungles of Africa, possibly giant saber-tooths of  another epoch, and these apparently had crossed with lions with the  resultant terrors that he occasionally encountered at the present day.    The true lions of this new, Old World differed but little from those  with which he was familiar; in size and conformation they were almost  identical, but instead of shedding the leopard spots of cubhood, they  retained them through life as definitely marked as those of the leopard.    Two months of effort had revealed no slightest evidence that she he  sought had entered this beautiful yet forbidding land. His  investigation, however, of the cannibal village and his questioning of  other tribes in the neighborhood had convinced him that if Lady Jane  still lived it must be in this direction that he seek her, since by a  process of elimination he had reduced the direction of her flight to  only this possibility. How she had crossed the morass he could not  guess and yet something within seemed to urge upon him belief that she  had crossed it, and that if she still lived it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: FRANKLIN ARMS]    [Illustration: FRANKLIN SEAL]    [Illustration: Franklin at the Court of Louis XVI        \"He was therefore, feasted and invited to all the court      parties.

Franklin's signature]      INTRODUCTION      We Americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell  us the secret of success in life; yet how often we are disappointed to  find nothing but commonplace statements, or receipts that we know by  heart but never follow. Most of the life stories of our famous and  successful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element  that makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp.  While we are searching far and near for some Aladdin's Lamp to give  coveted fortune, there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out  and take it, like the charm in Milton's _Comus_,      \"Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain     Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;\"    the interesting, human, and vividly told story of one of the wisest  and most useful lives in our own history, and perhaps in any history.  In Franklin's _Autobiography_ is offered not so much a ready-made  formula for success, as the companionship of a real flesh and blood  man of extraordinary mind and quality, whose daily walk and  conversation will help us to meet our own difficulties, much as does  the example of a wise and strong friend. While we are fascinated by  the story, we absorb the human experience through which a strong and  helpful character is building.    The thing that makes Franklin's _Autobiography_ different from every  other life story of a great and successful man is just this human  aspect of the account. Franklin told the story of his life, as he  himself says, for the benefit of his posterity. He wanted to help them  by the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence  and wealth. He is not unmindful of the importance of his public  services and their recognition, yet his accounts of these achievements  are given only as a part of the story, and the vanity displayed is  incidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital. There is  nothing of the impossible in the method and practice of Franklin as he  sets them forth. The youth who reads the fascinating story is  astonished to find that Franklin in his early years struggled with the  same everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences,  and he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a  realization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain.    There are other reasons why the _Autobiography_ should be an intimate  friend of American young people. Here they may establish a close  relationship with one of the foremost Americans as well as one of the  wisest men of his age.    The life of Benjamin Franklin is of importance to every American  primarily because of the part he played in securing the independence  of the United States and in establishing it as a nation. Franklin  shares with Washington the honors of the Revolution, and of the events  leading to the birth of the new nation. While Washington was the  animating spirit of the struggle in the colonies, Franklin was its  ablest champion abroad. To Franklin's cogent reasoning and keen  satire, we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the American  case in England and France; while to his personality and diplomacy as  well as to his facile pen, we are indebted for the foreign alliance  and the funds without which Washington's work must have failed. His  patience, fortitude, and practical wisdom, coupled with  self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of his country, are hardly less  noticeable than similar qualities displayed by Washington. In fact,  Franklin as a public man was much like Washington, especially in the  entire disinterestedness of his public service.    Franklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings  he has done more than any other American to advance the material  prosperity of his countrymen. It is said that his widely and  faithfully read maxims made Philadelphia and Pennsylvania wealthy,  while Poor Richard's pithy sayings, translated into many languages,  have had a world-wide influence.    Franklin is a good type of our American manhood. Although not the  wealthiest or the most powerful, he is undoubtedly,"]]]
