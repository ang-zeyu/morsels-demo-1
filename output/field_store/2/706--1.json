MASSACHUSETTS          PREFACE      It may surprise many, whose knowledge of wild animals is gained from  rare, fleeting glimpses of frightened hoof or wing in the woods, to  consider that there can be such a thing as a school for the Wood Folk;  or that instruction has any place in the life of the wild things.  Nevertheless it is probably true that education among the higher order  of animals has its distinct place and value. Their knowledge, however  simple, is still the result of three factors: instinct, training, and  experience. Instinct only begins the work; the mother's training  develops and supplements the instinct; and contact with the world, with  its sudden dangers and unknown forces, finishes the process.    For many years the writer has been watching animals and recording his  observations with the idea of determining, if possible, which of these  three is the governing factor in the animal's life. Some of the results  of this study were published last year in a book called \"School of the  Woods,\" which consisted of certain studies of animals from life, and  certain theories in the form of essays to account for what the writer's  eyes had seen and his own ears heard in the great wilderness among the  animals.    A school reader is no place for theories; therefore that part of the  book is not given here. The animal studies alone are reproduced in  answer to the requests from many teachers that these be added to the  Wood Folk books. From these the reader can form his own conclusions as  to the relative importance of instinct and training, if he will. But  there is another and a better way open: watch the purple martins for a  few days when the young birds first leave the house; find a crow's nest,  and watch secretly while the old birds are teaching their little ones to  fly; follow a fox, or any other wild mother-animal, patiently as she  leaves the den and leads the cubs out into the world of unknown sights  and sounds and smells,--and you will learn more in a week of what  education means to the animals than anybody's theories can ever teach  you.    These are largely studies of individual animals and birds. They do not  attempt to give the habits of a class or species, for the animals of the  same class are alike only in a general way; they differ in interest and  intelligence quite as widely as men and women of the same class, if you  but watch them closely enough. The names here given are those of the  Milicete Indians, as nearly as I can remember them; and the incidents  have all passed under my own-eyes and were recorded in the woods, from  my tent or canoe, just as I saw them.

I was following a little brook, which led  me by its singing to a deep dingle in the very heart of the big woods. A  great fallen tree lay across my path and made a bridge over the stream.  Now, bridges are for crossing; that is plain to even the least of the  wood folk; so I sat down on the mossy trunk to see who my neighbors  might be, and what little feet were passing on the King's highway.    Here, beside me, are claw marks in the moldy bark. Only a bear could  leave that deep, strong imprint. And see! there is where the moss  slipped and broke beneath his weight. A restless tramp is Mooween, who  scatters his records over forty miles of hillside on a summer day, when  his lazy mood happens to leave him for a season. Here, on the other  side, are the bronze-green petals of a spruce cone, chips from a  squirrel's workshop, scattered as if Meeko had brushed them hastily from  his yellow apron when he rushed out to see Mooween as he passed. There,  beyond, is a mink sign, plain as daylight, where Cheokhes sat down a  little while after his breakfast of frogs. And here, clinging to a stub,  touching my elbow as I sit with heels dangling idly over the lazy brook,  is a crinkly yellow hair, which tells me that Eleemos the Sly One, as  Simmo calls him, hates to wet his feet and so uses a fallen tree or a  stone in the brook for a bridge, like his brother fox of the  settlements.    Just in front of me was another fallen tree, lying alongside the stream  in such a way that no animal more dangerous than a roving mink would  ever think of using it. Under its roots, away from the brook, was a  hidden and roomy little house with hemlock tips drooping over its  doorway for a curtain. \"A pretty place for a den,\" I thought; \"for no  one could ever find you there.\" Then, as if to contradict me, a stray  sunbeam found the spot and sent curious bright glintings of sheen and  shadow dancing and playing under the fallen roots and trunk.  \"Beautiful!\" I cried, as the light fell on the brown mold and flecked it  with white and yellow. The sunbeam went away again, but seemed to leave  its brightness behind it; for there were still the gold-brown mold  under the roots and the flecks of white and yellow. I stooped down to  see it better; I reached in my hand--then the brown mold changed  suddenly to softest fur; the glintings of white and yellow were the  dappled sides of two little fawns, lying there very still and  frightened, just where their mother had hidden them when she went away.    They were but a few days old when I found them. Each had on his little  Joseph's coat; and each, I think, must have had also a magic cloak  somewhere about him; for he had only to lie down anywhere to become  invisible. The curious markings, like the play of light and shadow  through the leaves, hid the little owners perfectly so long as they held  themselves still and let the sunbeams dance over them. Their beautiful  heads were a study for an artist,--delicate, graceful, exquisitely  colored. And their great soft eyes had a questioning innocence, as they  met yours, which went straight to your heart and made you claim the  beautiful creatures for your own instantly. Indeed, there is nothing in  all the woods that so takes your heart by storm as the face of a little  fawn.    They were timid at first, lying close without motion of any kind. The  instinct of obedience--the first and strongest instinct of every  creature born into this world--kept them loyal to the mother's command  to stay where they were and be still till she came back. So even after  the hemlock curtain was brushed aside, and my eyes saw and my hand  touched them, they kept their heads flat to the ground and pretended  that they were only parts of the brown forest floor, and that the spots  on their bright coats were but flecks of summer sunshine.    I felt then that I was an intruder; that I ought to go straight away and  leave them; but the little things were too beautiful, lying there in  their wonderful old den, with fear and wonder and questionings dancing  in their soft eyes as they turned them back at me like a mischievous  child playing peekaboo. It is a tribute to our higher nature that one  cannot see a beautiful thing anywhere without wanting to draw near, to  see, to touch, to possess it. And here was beauty such as one rarely  finds, and, though I was an intruder, I could not go away.    The hand that touched the little wild things brought no sense of danger  with it. It searched out the spots behind their velvet ears where they  love to be rubbed; it wandered down over their backs with a little wavy  caress in its motion; it curled its palm up softly under their moist  muzzles and brought their tongues out instantly for the faint suggestion  of salt that was in it. Suddenly their heads came up. All deception was  over now. They had forgotten their hiding, their first lesson; they  turned and looked at me full with their great, innocent, questioning  eyes. It was wonderful; I was undone.

APPLETON AND COMPANY    _All rights reserved_    _Published October, 1903_    EDITOR'S PREFACE      In issuing these volumes of a series of Handbooks on the Artistic  Crafts, it will be well to state what are our general aims.    In the first place, we wish to provide trustworthy text-books of  workshop practise, from the points of view of experts who have  critically examined the methods current in the shops, and putting aside  vain survivals, are prepared to say what is good workmanship, and to set  up a standard of quality in the crafts which are more especially  associated with design. Secondly, in doing this, we hope to treat design  itself as an essential part of good workmanship. During the last century  most of the arts, save painting and sculpture of an academic kind, were  little considered, and there was a tendency to look on \"design\" as a  mere matter of _appearance_. Such \"ornamentation\" as there was was  usually obtained by following in a mechanical way a drawing provided by  an artist who often knew little of the technical processes involved in  production. With the critical attention given to the crafts by Ruskin  and Morris, it came to be seen that it was impossible to detach design  from craft in this way, and that, in the widest sense, true design is an  inseparable element of good quality, involving as it does the selection  of good and suitable material, contrivance for special purpose, expert  workmanship, proper finish, and so on, far more than mere ornament, and  indeed, that ornamentation itself was rather an exuberance of fine  workmanship than a matter of merely abstract lines. Workmanship when  separated by too wide a gulf from fresh thought--that is, from  design--inevitably decays, and, on the other hand, ornamentation,  divorced from workmanship, is necessarily unreal, and quickly falls into  affectation. Proper ornamentation may be defined as a language  addressed to the eye; it is pleasant thought expressed in the speech of  the tool.    In the third place, we would have this series put artistic craftsmanship  before people as furnishing reasonable occupations for those who would  gain a livelihood. Although within the bounds of academic art, the  competition, of its kind, is so acute that only a very few per cent can  fairly hope to succeed as painters and sculptors; yet, as artistic  craftsmen, there is every probability that nearly every one who would  pass through a sufficient period of apprenticeship to workmanship and  design would reach a measure of success.    In the blending of handwork and thought in such arts as we propose to  deal with, happy careers may be found as far removed from the dreary  routine of hack labor as from the terrible uncertainty of academic art.  It is desirable in every way that men of good education should be  brought back into the productive crafts: there are more than enough of  us \"in the city,\" and it is probable that more consideration will be  given in this century than in the last to Design and Workmanship.           *       *       *       *       *    This third volume of our series treats of one branch of the great art of  sculpture, one which in the past has been in close association with  architecture. It is, well, therefore, that besides dealing thoroughly,  as it does, with the craftsmanship of wood-carving, it should also be  concerned with the theory of design, and with the subject-matter which  the artist should select to carve.    Such considerations should be helpful to all who are interested in the  ornamental arts. Indeed, the present book contains some of the best  suggestions as to architectural ornamentation under modern circumstances  known to me. Architects can not forever go on plastering buildings over  with trade copies of ancient artistic thinking, and they and the public  must some day realize that it is not mere shapes, but only _thoughts_,  which will make reasonable the enormous labor spent on the decoration of  buildings. Mere structure will always justify itself, and architects who  can not obtain living ornamentation will do well to fall back on  structure well fitted for its purpose, and as finely finished as may be  without carvings and other adornments. It would be better still if  architects would make the demand for a more intellectual code of  ornament than we have been accustomed to for so long.    On the side of the carver, either in wood or in stone, we want men who  will give us their own thought in their own work--as artists, that  is--and will not be content to be mere hacks supplying imitations of all  styles to order.    On the teaching of wood-carving I should like to say a word, as I have  watched the course of instruction in many schools. It is desirable that  classes should be provided with casts and photographs of good examples,  such as Mr. Jack speaks of, varying from rough choppings up to minute  and exquisite work, but all having the breath of life about them. There  should also be a good supply of illustrations and photographs of birds  and beasts and flowers, and above all, some branches and buds of real  leafage. Then I would set the student of design in wood-carving to make  _variations_ of such examples according to his own skill and liking. If  he and the teacher could be got to clear their minds of ideas of  \"style,\" and to take some example simply because they liked it, and to  adapt it just because it amused them, the mystery of design would be  nearly solved. Most design will always be the making of one thing like  another, with a difference. Later, motives from Nature should be brought  in, but always with some guidance as to treatment, from an example known  to be fine. I would say, for instance, \"Do a panel like this, only let  it be oak foliage instead of vine, and get a thrush or a parrot out of  the bird book.\"    In regard to the application of carving, I have been oppressed by the  accumulation in carving classes of little carved squares and oblongs,  having no relation to anything that, in an ordinary way, is carved. To  carve the humblest real thing, were it but a real toy for a child, would  be better than the production of these panels, or of the artificial  trivialities which our minds instinctively associate with bazaars.      W. R. LETHABY.    _September, 1903._          AUTHOR'S PREFACE      TO THE READER,    Be you 'prentice or student, or what is still better, both in one, I  introduce the following pages to you with this explanation: that all  theoretical opinions set forth therein are the outcome of many years of  patient sifting and balancing of delicate questions, and these have with  myself long since passed out of the category of mere \"opinions\" into  that of settled convictions. With regard to the practical matter of  \"technique,\" it lies very much with yourself to determine the degree of  perfection to which you may attain. This depends greatly upon the amount  of application which you may be willing or able to devote to its  practise.    Remember--the laws which govern all good art must be known before they  can be obeyed; they are subtle, but unalterable. The conditions most  favorable to your craft must first be understood before these laws can  be recognized. There yet remains at your own disposal that devotion of  energy which is the first essential step, both in the direction of  obtaining clearer views and in conquering technical difficulties.    I have to thank the following gentlemen for their assistance in  providing photographs for some of the illustrations: Messrs. Bedford  Lemere & Co.--H. Sandland--Charles C. Winmill--W. Weir--J. R.
