LONDON:  PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES,  STAMFORD STREET.          TO    SIR HENRY HALFORD, BART., M.D., F.R.S., F.A.S.,    PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, LONDON,  PHYSICIAN TO THE KING, &c. &c.    THE FOLLOWING PAGES    ARE,    WITH HIS PERMISSION,    AND WITH    A GRATEFUL SENSE OF THE HONOUR THUS CONFERRED UPON THEIR  AUTHOR, MOST RESPECTFULLY    DEDICATED.          PREFACE.      Several cases which I witnessed led me to believe, some years ago, that  inflammation of the brain, or its membranes, might be produced in  children, owing to their being suckled for an undue length of time.  Since that period, having enjoyed opportunities of observing infantile  diseases on a much more extended scale, and my attention being expressly  directed to the point in question, I not only became fully convinced of  the correctness of my previous conclusions, but was induced to carry  them still farther.    My opinions on this subject were briefly drawn up and published in the  _Medical and Physical Journal_ for August 1827, and have not passed  altogether unnoticed by my professional brethren[1], some of whom have  done me the honour to speak of them in flattering terms, while no one, I  believe, has attempted to disprove the existence of the important fact I  was the first to announce.    [1] Vide Medico-Chirurgical Review, Gazette of Health, Dendy on  Cutaneous Diseases, &c.    The bare statement of that fact was, indeed, nearly all that my  approaching departure from England, at the time last mentioned, left in  my power: upon the present occasion I have offered arguments for, and  endeavoured to anticipate those against, the deductions I then made  public; and however imperfect may have been my success in either, the  welfare of society at large is too deeply involved in the establishment  of my opinions with respect to the custom I condemn, (if those opinions  be correct,) for me to hesitate while again committing them to the press  in a more extended form.    These considerations, I respectfully submit, will render any apology for  the appearance of the following pages unnecessary, and will, I trust,  secure for them a candid and favourable reception from the Profession  and the Public.    _15, Eaton Street, Grosvenor Place,            October 8, 1831._          CONTENTS.

CHAPTER I.    _Of the Breast-Milk, &c. &c._      No sooner has the child been ushered into the world than the breasts of  the mother pour forth their milk for its sustenance. This bland fluid is  secreted from the blood, and varies, in quality and quantity, according  to the time which has elapsed from delivery, being peculiarly and  wonderfully adapted at every period to the wants of the individual for  whose use it is destined. Thus, that first secreted, called _colostrum_,  possesses a purgative quality evidently intended by the all-wise Author  of our being for the purpose of removing _the meconium_[A],--a process  which experience has sufficiently proved to be necessary for the welfare  of the newly-born infant. Afterwards, ceasing to possess this aperient  property, it is calculated solely for affording nutrition; and finally,  at a certain period from delivery, it gradually becomes impoverished,  loses its former healthy qualities altogether, and acquires others which  are injurious to life. This important change, as above noticed,  generally happens at a certain period after delivery; varying, however,  somewhat in particular women, and in the same female on different  occasions: but, from disease, or other circumstances, the milk may  become deteriorated before the time to which reference has just been  made. If, for instance, the mother labour under any serious disorder, it  is universally admitted that her milk may also become unhealthy; and  this may take place even a short interval after delivery.    Although we cannot explain how the brain and nerves act, and probably  never shall be able to do so, yet we are well aware that their influence  is absolutely requisite for the healthy performance of every function in  the human body.    That mental inquietude will impede digestion is a fact familiar to  almost every one; but, I believe, it is not so generally known, that it  will with no less certainty retard and alter the nature of the secretion  furnished by the breasts of the lactescent female. Violent affections of  the mind will cause the milk to become thin and yellowish, and to  acquire noxious properties: even the fond mother's anxiety, while  hanging over the couch of her sick infant, will be sufficient to render  it unfit for the sustenance of the object of her solicitude.    The state also of the stomach and bowels and the diet of the nurse  materially and constantly influence the nature of the lacteal secretion.    The milk, besides, is liable to deterioration from another cause,  namely, the recurrence of the usual periodical appearance--for should  this take place in a nurse, it is agreed that her milk is liable to  produce disorders in the child who imbibes it; which could not happen,  if the former possessed its ordinary component parts, and retained its  natural properties.    The recurrence, moreover, of pregnancy in the lactescent female may  render the milk of a bad quality, and will invariably lessen its  quantity. Mr. Burns asserts that in these cases the milk 'does not  become hurtful,' but in this opinion I must beg leave to differ from  him; since I have repeatedly seen it, from this cause, palpably altered  in appearance, and have observed diarrh[oe]a and great debility produced  in the children who were suckled with it.    An almost universally received opinion among females, and, indeed, one  very frequently entertained by members of the medical profession, is,  that while a woman continues to nurse her infant she will not again  become pregnant; but this, as a general proposition, is unquestionably  erroneous; it is even doubtful whether such opinion will hold good in a  majority of instances. The continuance of lactation will very generally,  it is true, tend to prevent the recurrence of the periodical phenomenon;  yet, nevertheless, it will not in every instance prevent pregnancy[B].  Should, however, a woman with an infant at the breast again become  pregnant, (a circumstance that very frequently occurs, and of which,  from the _general though not invariable_ absence of those criteria by  which this fact is accustomed to be recognised, she is not aware until  it has made some progress,) one of two things will usually take place;  either she will miscarry, or her milk will become impoverished in  quality and diminished in quantity. Nor is this wonderful:--it was not  intended by Nature that the processes of pregnancy and lactation should  go on simultaneously, but, on the contrary, that the one should commence  when the other had terminated; and experience sufficiently proves that  they will not proceed well together: the reason of which, as it appears  to me, may be easily given. During pregnancy, and particularly during  its latter periods, the vessels of the womb gradually enlarge, and a  much greater quantity of blood than usual is determined to that organ  for the increase and perfection of the embryo and its appendages; which,  after delivery, becomes transferred to the breasts to supply the  material for the secretion of the milk: but if, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net            [Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected,  all other inconsistencies are as in the original.

BY M. FLEURY DE CHABOULON,         Ex-Secretary of the Emperor Napoleon and of his Cabinets,       Master of Requests to the Council of State, Baron, Officer       of the Legion of Honour, and Knight of the Order of Reunion.                               VOL. I.                               LONDON:                JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE-STREET.                            1820.          TO THE READER.      The revolution of the 20th of March will form unquestionably the most  remarkable episode in the life of Napoleon, so fertile as it is in  supernatural events. It has not been my intention, to write the  history of it: this noble task is above my powers: I have only  attempted, to place Napoleon on the stage of action, and oppose his  words, his deeds, and the truth, to the erroneous assertions of  certain historians, the falsehoods of the spirit of party, and the  insults of those timeserving writers, who are accustomed to insult in  misfortune those, to whom they have subsequently paid court.    Hitherto people have not been able to agree on the motives and  circumstances, that determined the Emperor, to quit the island of  Elba. Some supposed, that he had acted of his own accord: others, that  he had conspired with his partisans the downfal of the Bourbons. Both  these suppositions are equally false. The world will learn with  surprise, perhaps with admiration, that this astonishing revolution  was the work of two individuals and a few words.    The narrative of Colonel Z***, so valuable from the facts it reveals,  appears to me to merit the reader's attention in other respects. On  studying it carefully, we find in it the exhibition of those defects,  those qualities, those passions, which, confounded together, form the  character, so full of contrasts, of the incomprehensible Napoleon. We  perceive him alternatively mistrustful and communicative, ardent and  reserved, enterprising and irresolute, vindictive and generous,  favourable to liberty and despotic. But we see predominant above all,  that activity, that strength, that ardour of mind, those brilliant  inspirations, and those sudden resolves, that belong only to  extraordinary men, to men of genius.    The conferences I had at Bale with the mysterious agent of Prince  Metternich have remained to this day buried in profound secrecy. The  historians, who have preceded me, relate, without any explanation,  that the Duke of Otranto laid before the Emperor, at the moment of his  abdication, a letter from M. de Metternich; and that this letter,  artfully worded, had determined Napoleon to abdicate, in the hope that  the crown would devolve to his son. The particulars given in these  Memoirs will entirely change the ideas formed of this letter, and of  its influence. They confirm the opinion too, pretty generally  prevalent, that the allied sovereigns deemed the restoration of the  Bourbons of little importance, and would willingly have consented, to  place the young Prince Napoleon on the throne.    It had been supposed, that the famous decree, by which Prince de  Talleyrand and his illustrious accomplices were sent before the courts  of justice, was issued at Lyons in the first burst of a fit of  vengeance. It will be seen, that it was the result of a plan simply  political: and the noble resistance, which General Bertrand (now  labouring under a sentence of death) thought it his duty to oppose to  this measure, will add, if it be possible, to the high esteem, merited  on so many accounts by this faithful friend to the unfortunate.    The writings published previously to this work, equally contain  nothing but inaccurate or fabulous reports, with regard to the  abdication of Napoleon. Certain historians have been pleased, to  represent Napoleon in a pitious state of despondency: others have  depicted him as the sport of the threats of M. Regnault St. Jean  d'Angely, and of the artifices of the Duke of Otranto. These Memoirs  will show, that Napoleon, far from having fallen into a state of  weakness, that would no longer permit him to wield the sceptre,  aspired, on the contrary, to be invested with a temporary  dictatorship, and that, when he consented to abdicate, it was because  the energetic attitude of the representatives disconcerted him, and he  yielded to the fear of adding the calamities of a civil war to the  disasters of a foreign invasion.    It was perfectly unknown too, that Napoleon was detained a prisoner at  Malmaison after his abdication. It was presumed, that he deferred his  departure, in the hope of being replaced at the head of the army and  of the government. These Memoirs will show, that this hope, if it  dwelt within the breast of Napoleon, was not the real motive of his  stay in France; and that he was detained there by the committee of  government, till the moment when, honour outweighing all political  considerations, it obliged Napoleon to depart, to prevent his falling  into the hands of Blucher.    The negotiations and conferences of the French plenipotentiaries with  the enemy's generals; the proceedings of the Prince of Eckmuhl; the  intrigues of the Duke of Otranto; the efforts of those members of the  committee, who remained faithful to their trust; the debates on the  capitulation of Paris, and all the collateral facts, connected with  these different circumstances, had been totally misrepresented; These  Memoirs establish or unfold the truth. They bring to light the conduct  of those members of the committee, who were supposed to be the dupes  or accomplices of Fouche; and that of the marshals, the army, and the  chambers. They contain also the correspondence of the plenipotentiaries,  and the instructions given to them; documents hitherto unpublished,  which will make known, what the politics and wishes of the government  of France at that time were.    Finally I shall observe, in order to complete the account I think it  right to give the reader of the substance of this work, that it  furnishes elucidations of the campaign of 1815, the want of which has  been imperiously felt. The causes, that determined Napoleon, to  separate from his army at Laon, were not known: I point them out.  General Gourgaud, in his narrative, could give no explanation of the  march of the corps of Count Erlon at the battle of Ligny, of the  conduct of Marshal Ney on the 16th, of the inactivity of Napoleon on  the 17th, &c. All these points, I believe, I have elucidated. I show  also, that it was not, as General Gourgaud and other writers assert,  to raise the spirits, and excite the courage of the French army, that  its leader announced to it the arrival of Marshal Grouchy. It is a  certain fact, that Napoleon was himself deceived by a brisk firing,  which took place between the Prussians and Saxons; and it is falsely,  that he has been charged with having knowingly deceived his soldiers,  at a moment when the laws of war and of humanity presented to him, to  think rather of a retreat, than of continuing the battle.    I had at first rejected from these Memoirs such official papers, as  had already been made known: but have since thought, that they ought  to be inserted. This work, which embraces all the events of the reign  of a Hundred Days, would be imperfect, if the reader were obliged to  refer to the papers of the day; to read or consult the act of the  congress of Vienna, that placed the Emperor Napoleon out of the pale  of the law of nations; the Additional Act, which occasioned his loss  of popularity; and the eloquent speeches and nervous declarations by  which Napoleon, his ministers, and his counsellors, sought to explain  and justify the 20th of March. I have thought, besides, that perhaps  the reader would not find it uninteresting, to witness the contests  exhibited, at that important period, between the legitimacy of  nations and the legitimacy of sovereigns.    The colours under which I represent Napoleon, the justice I do him for  the purity of his intentions, will not please all the world. Many  persons, who would blindly have believed any ill I could say of the  ancient sovereigns of France, will give little credit to my eulogies:  they are wrong: if praises lavished on power be suspicious, those  bestowed on the unfortunate will be true; to doubt them would be  sacrilege.    Neither can I conceal from myself, that the men, who, from principle,  see nothing but a hateful conspiracy in the revolution of the 20th of  March, will accuse me of having embellished facts, and designedly  distorted the truth. No matter: I have depicted this revolution as I  saw it, as I felt it. How many others are pleased, to tarnish the  honour of the nation, to represent their countrymen as composed of  rebels or cowards! For my part, I think it the duty of a good  Frenchman, to prove to all Europe, that the king was not guilty of  abandoning France:    That the insurrection of the 20th of March was not the work of a few  factious persons, who might have been repressed; but a grand national  act, against which the efforts and volitions of individuals would have  been vain:    That the royalists were not cowards, and all other Frenchmen traitors:    Lastly, that the return from the island of Elba was the terrible  consequence of the faults of ministers and the ultras, which called to  France the man of fate, as the conductor draws down the lightning from  heaven.
