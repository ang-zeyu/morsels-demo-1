Bath, England          EDITOR'S PREFACE      In issuing these volumes of a series of Handbooks on the Artistic  Crafts, it will be well to state what are our general aims.    In the first place, we wish to provide trustworthy text-books of  workshop practice, from the points of view of experts who have  critically examined the methods current in the shops, and putting aside  vain survivals, are prepared to say what is good workmanship, and to set  up a standard of quality in the crafts which are more especially  associated with design. Secondly, in doing this, we hope to treat design  itself as an essential part of good workmanship. During the last century  most of the arts, save painting and sculpture of an academic kind, were  little considered, and there was a tendency to look on \"design\" as a  mere matter of _appearance_. Such \"ornamentation\" as there was was  usually obtained by following in a mechanical way a drawing provided by  an artist who often knew little of the technical processes involved in  production. With the critical attention given to the crafts by Ruskin  and Morris, it came to be seen that it was impossible to detach design  from craft in this way, and that, in the widest sense, true design is an  inseparable element of good quality, involving as it does the selection  of good and suitable material, contrivance for special purpose, expert  workmanship, proper finish, and so on, far more than mere ornament, and  indeed, that ornamentation itself was rather an exuberance of fine  workmanship than a matter of merely abstract lines. Workmanship when  separated by too wide a gulf from fresh thought--that is, from  design--inevitably decays, and, on the other hand, ornamentation,  divorced from workmanship, is necessarily unreal, and quickly falls  into affectation. Proper ornamentation may be defined as a language  addressed to the eye; it is pleasant thought expressed in the speech of  the tool.    In the third place, we would have this series put artistic craftsmanship  before people as furnishing reasonable occupations for those who would  gain a livelihood. Although within the bounds of academic art, the  competition, of its kind, is so acute that only a very few per cent. can  fairly hope to succeed as painters and sculptors; yet, as artistic  craftsmen, there is every probability that nearly every one who would  pass through a sufficient period of apprenticeship to workmanship and  design would reach a measure of success.    In the blending of hand-work and thought in such arts as we propose to  deal with, happy careers may be found as far removed from the dreary  routine of hack labour as from the terrible uncertainty of academic art.  It is desirable in every way that men of good education should be  brought back into the productive crafts: there are more than enough of  us \"in the city,\" and it is probable that more consideration will be  given in this century than in the last to Design and Workmanship.           *       *       *       *       *    There are two common ways of studying old and foreign arts--the way of  the connoisseur and the way of the craftsman. The collector may value  such arts for their strangeness and scarcity, while the artist finds in  them stimulus in his own work and hints for new developments.    The following account of colour-printing from wood-blocks is based on a  study of the methods which were lately only practised in Japan, but  which at an earlier time were to some degree in use in Europe also. The  main principles of the art, indeed, were well known in the West long  before colour prints were produced in Japan, and there is some reason to  suppose that the Japanese may have founded their methods in imitating  the prints taken from Europe by missionaries. Major Strange says: \"The  European art of _chiaroscuro_ engraving is in all essentials identical  with that of Japanese colour-printing.... It seems, therefore, not vain  to point out that the accidental sight of one of the Italian  colour-prints may have suggested the process to the Japanese.\" The  Italians aimed more at expressing \"relief\" and the Japanese at flat  colour arrangements; the former used oily colours, and the latter fair  distemper tints; these are the chief differences. Both in the West and  the East the design was cut on the plank surface of the wood with a  knife; not across the grain with a graver, as is done in most modern  wood engraving, although large plank woodcuts were produced by Walter  Crane and Herkomer, about thirty years ago, as posters.    The old woodcuts of the fifteenth century were produced as pictures as  well as for the illustration of books; frequently they were of  considerable size. Often, too, they were coloured by stencil plates or  freely by hand.    At the same time the printing in colour of letters and other simple  devices in books from wood-blocks was done, and a book printed at St.  Albans in 1486 has many coats of arms printed in this way; some of the  shields having two or three different colours.[1]    About the year 1500 a method of printing woodcuts in several flat tones  was invented in Germany and practised by Lucas Cranach and others. A  fine print of Adam and Eve by Hans Baldung in the Victoria and Albert  Museum has, besides the bold black \"drawing,\" an over-tint printed in  warm brown out of which sharp high lights are cut; the print is thus in  three tones.    [1] See R. M. Burch, _Colour Printing_, 1900.    Ugo da Carpo (_c._ 1480-1530) working in Venice, introduced this new  type of tone woodcut into Italy; indeed, he claimed to be the inventor  of the method. \"This was called _chiaroscuro_, a name still given to  it, and was, in fact, a simple form of our modern chromo printing.\" His  woodcuts are in a simple, vigorous style; one of them after Raphael's  \"Death of Ananias,\" printed in brown, has a depth and brilliancy which  may remind us of the mezzo-tints of Turner's _Liber Studiorum_. This is  proudly signed, \"Per Ugo da Carpo,\" and some copies are said to be dated  1518.    Andrea Andreani (_c._ 1560-1623), a better known but not a better  artist, produced a great number of these tone woodcuts. Several prints  after Mantegna's \"Triumphs of Caesar\" have a special charm from the  beauty of the originals; they are printed in three tints of grey besides  the \"drawing\"; the palest of these tints covers the surface, except for  high lights cut out of it. A fine print of a Holy Family, about 15x18  inches, has a middle tone of fair blue and a shadow tint of full rich  green. Copies of two immense woodcuts at the Victoria and Albert Museum,  of Biblical subjects, seem to have been seems to cramp the hand and  injure the eyes of all but the most gifted draughtsmen. It is desirable  to cultivate the ability to seize and record the \"map-form\" of any  object rapidly and correctly. Some practice in elementary  colour-printing would certainly be of general usefulness, and simpler  exercises may be contrived by cutting out with scissors and laying down  shapes in black or coloured papers unaided by any pattern.    Finally, the hope may be expressed that the beautiful art of  wood-cutting as developed in Western Europe and brought to such  perfection only a generation ago is only temporarily in abeyance, and  that it too may have another day.                                                    W. R. LETHABY.    _September 1916._          AUTHOR'S NOTE      This little book gives an account of one of the primitive crafts, in the  practice of which only the simplest tools and materials are used. Their  method of use may serve as a means of expression for artist-craftsmen,  or may be studied in preparation for, or as a guide towards, more  elaborate work in printing, of which the main principles may be seen  most clearly in their application in the primitive craft.    In these days the need for reference to primitive handicrafts has not  ceased with the advent of the machine. The best achievements of  hand-work will always be the standards for reference; and on their study  must machine craft be based. The machine can only increase the power  and scale of the crafts that have already been perfected by hand-work.  Their principles, and the art of their design, do not alter under the  machine. If the machine disregards these its work becomes base. And it  is under the simple conditions of a handicraft that the principles of an  art can be most clearly experienced.    The best of all the wonderful and excellent work that is produced to-day  by machinery is that which bears evidence in itself of its derivation  from arts under the pure conditions of classic craftsmanship, and shows  the influence of their study.    The series of which this book is a part stands for the principles and  the spirit of the classic examples.

The nature and character of slavery have been subjects of an  almost endless variety of artistic representation; and after the  brilliant achievements in that field, and while those achievements are  yet fresh in the memory of the million, he who would add another to the  legion, must possess the charm of transcendent excellence, or apologize  for something worse than rashness. The reader is, therefore, assured,  with all due promptitude, that his attention is not invited to a work of  ART, but to a work of FACTS--Facts, terrible and almost incredible, it  may be yet FACTS, nevertheless.    I am authorized to say that there is not a fictitious name nor place  in the whole volume; but that names and places are literally given, and  that every transaction therein described actually transpired.    Perhaps the best Preface to this volume is furnished in the following  letter of Mr. Douglass, written in answer to my urgent solicitation for  such a work:                                    ROCHESTER, N. Y. _July_ 2, 1855.    DEAR FRIEND: I have long entertained, as you very well know, a somewhat  positive repugnance to writing or speaking anything for the public,  which could, with any degree of plausibilty, make me liable to the  imputation of seeking personal notoriety, for its own sake. Entertaining  that feeling very sincerely, and permitting its control, perhaps, quite  unreasonably, I have often{2} refused to narrate my personal experience  in public anti-slavery meetings, and in sympathizing circles, when urged  to do so by friends, with whose views and wishes, ordinarily, it were a  pleasure to comply. In my letters and speeches, I have generally  aimed to discuss the question of Slavery in the light of fundamental  principles, and upon facts, notorious and open to all; making, I trust,  no more of the fact of my own former enslavement, than circumstances  seemed absolutely to require. I have never placed my opposition to  slavery on a basis so narrow as my own enslavement, but rather upon the  indestructible and unchangeable laws of human nature, every one of which  is perpetually and flagrantly violated by the slave system. I have also  felt that it was best for those having histories worth the writing--or  supposed to be so--to commit such work to hands other than their own. To  write of one's self, in such a manner as not to incur the imputation of  weakness, vanity, and egotism, is a work within the ability of but few;  and I have little reason to believe that I belong to that fortunate few.    These considerations caused me to hesitate, when first you kindly urged  me to prepare for publication a full account of my life as a slave, and  my life as a freeman.    Nevertheless, I see, with you, many reasons for regarding my  autobiography as exceptional in its character, and as being, in some  sense, naturally beyond the reach of those reproaches which honorable  and sensitive minds dislike to incur. It is not to illustrate any heroic  achievements of a man, but to vindicate a just and beneficent principle,  in its application to the whole human family, by letting in the light of  truth upon a system, esteemed by some as a blessing, and by others as a  curse and a crime. I agree with you, that this system is now at the bar  of public opinion--not only of this country, but of the whole civilized  world--for judgment. Its friends have made for it the usual plea--\"not  guilty;\" the case must, therefore, proceed. Any facts, either from  slaves, slaveholders, or by-standers, calculated to enlighten the public  mind, by revealing the true nature, character, and tendency of the slave  system, are in order, and can scarcely be innocently withheld.    I see, too, that there are special reasons why I should write my own  biography, in preference to employing another to do it. Not only is  slavery on trial, but unfortunately, the enslaved people are also on  trial. It is alleged, that they are, naturally, inferior; that they are  _so low_ in the scale of humanity, and so utterly stupid, that they are  unconscious of their wrongs, and do not apprehend their rights. Looking,  then, at your request, from this stand-point, and wishing everything of  which you think me capable to go to the benefit of my afflicted people,  I part with my doubts and hesitation, and proceed to furnish you  the desired manuscript; hoping that you may be able to make such  arrangements for its publication as shall be best adapted to accomplish  that good which you so enthusiastically anticipate.    FREDERICK DOUGLASS  {3}    There was little necessity for doubt and hesitation on the part of Mr.  Douglass, as to the propriety of his giving to the world a full account  of himself. A man who was born and brought up in slavery, a living  witness of its horrors; who often himself experienced its cruelties; and  who, despite the depressing influences surrounding his birth, youth and  manhood, has risen, from a dark and almost absolute obscurity, to the  distinguished position which he now occupies, might very well assume the  existence of a commendable curiosity, on the part of the public, to know  the facts of his remarkable history.    EDITOR          INTRODUCTION      When a man raises himself from the lowest condition in society to  the highest, mankind pay him the tribute of their admiration; when he  accomplishes this elevation by native energy, guided by prudence and  wisdom, their admiration is increased; but when his course, onward and  upward, excellent in itself, furthermore proves a possible, what had  hitherto been regarded as an impossible, reform, then he becomes a  burning and a shining light, on which the aged may look with gladness,  the young with hope, and the down-trodden, as a representative of  what they may themselves become. To such a man, dear reader, it is my  privilege to introduce you."]]]
