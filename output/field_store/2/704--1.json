Then  the buffaloes, which were disappearing, would come back in the immense  herds of the olden time._    _The vision of one of the dreamer priests is represented. After  reaching the spirit world, Bianki found himself on a vast prairie  covered with innumerable buffaloes and ponies. He went through the  herds (dotted lines) until he came to a large Kiowa camp, with its  ornament tepees. He met four young women who had died years before,  and asked about two of his brothers, also dead. He soon met them  coming into camp, with buffalo meat hanging from their saddles._]    [Illustration: _Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution_]          PREFACE      From the edge of the Darkening Land, where stand the mountains which  encircle the earth-plain, eastward toward the Sunland, lie the great  plains of America. Smooth and flat and green they stretch away,  hundreds of miles, rising from a dead level into a soft rolling of the  land, then into the long green waves of the prairies where rivers  flow, where the water ripples as it flows, and trees shade the banks  of the gleaming water.    Here, amidst the vast sweep of the plains which stretch away to the  horizon on every side, boundless, limitless, endless, lived the plains  Indians. Standing in the midst of this vast green plain on a soft May  morning, after the Thunder Gods have passed, when the sun is shining  in the soft blue above, and the sweet, rain-swept air is blown about  by the Four Winds which are always near to man, day and  night,--standing far out on the plains with no hint of the white man  or his work--one sees the earth somewhat as the Indian saw it and  wonders not at his reverence for the Mysterious One who dwelt  overhead, beyond the blue stone arch, and for the lesser powers which  came to him over the four paths guarded by the Four Winds. It was  Wakoda, the Mysterious One, who gave to man the sunshine, the clear  rippling water, the clear sky from which all storms, all clouds are  absent, the sky which is the symbol of peace. Through this sky sweeps  the eagle, the \"Mother\" of Indian songs, bearing upon her strong wings  the message of peace and calling to her nestlings as she flies. Little  wonder that to some tribes song was an integral part of their lives,  and that emotions too deep for words were expressed in song.    Other songs there were, with words, songs of the birds which fly  through that soft, tender blue:        All around the birds in flocks are flying;      Dipping, rising, circling, see them coming.      See, many birds are flocking here,      All about us now together coming.        [_Pawnee_]    The power to fly has always inspired Indians of all tribes and of all  degrees of civilization with wonder and reverence. The bird chiefs  have their own places in Indian myths. Owl is chief of the night;  Woodpecker, with his ceaseless tattoo on the trees, is chief of the  trees; Duck is chief of the water; but Eagle is chief of the day. It  is always Eagle who is chief of the birds, even though Wren may outwit  him in a tale told by the fire glimmering in the tepee, when the story  tellers of the tribe tell of the happenings in the days \"way beyond.\"  It is Eagle who inspires admiration, and becomes the most sacred bird.        Round about a tree in ever widening circles an eagle flies, alert,          watching o'er his nest;      Loudly whistles he, a challenge sending far, o'er the country wide          it echoes, there defying foes.        [_Pawnee_]    In the breeze that rippled the long grass of the prairie and fluttered  the flaps of the graceful tepee, waved also the corn, sent by  Old-Woman-Who-Never-Dies, the ever returning life of the green thing  growing. In the ravines and on the lower slopes of the grassy waves of  the prairie bellowed the buffalo, or grazed in silence, having long  since come up from the underground world and become the source of the  Indian's food, clothing, home, utensils, and comfort. Endless were the  charms and enchantments to bring the buffalo herds near his camping  ground. Severe was the punishment meted out to the thoughtless warrior  whose unguarded eagerness frightened the herds and sent them away.    Over the plains and prairies, at other times, swept the Thunder Gods,  with their huge jointed wings, darkening all the land, and flashing  fire from angry eyes which struck down man and beast. Terrified were  the Indians when the Thunder Gods rolled. Vows made to them must be  kept, for relentless were they.    \"Oh, grandfather,\" prayed the Indian when the sky was black and the  lightning flashed, as he filled a pipe with tobacco and offered it  skyward, \"Oh, grandfather! I am very poor. Somewhere make those who  would injure me leave a clear space for me.\" Then he put the sacred  green cedar upon the fire--the cedar which stayed awake those seven  nights and therefore does not lose its hair every winter--and the  smoke from the sacred, burning wood, rolling upward, appeased the  rolling Thunders.           *       *       *       *       *    The authorities used in this compilation are those found in the annual  reports of the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Publications of  the United States Geographical and Geological Survey: contributions to  North American Ethnology. Of the various ethnologists whose work has  been used, those of especial importance are Alice C. Fletcher, whose  wonderful work among the Omaha and Pawnee Indians is deserving of the  most careful study, J. Owen Dorsey, James Mooney, and S. R. Riggs.    No claim whatever is made for original work. Indeed, original work of  any kind in a compilation such as this would impair the authenticity  of the myths, and therefore destroy the value of this work. Nor has  any effort been made towards \"style.\" The only style worth having in  telling an Indian legend is that of the Indian himself.        K. B.

MUSIC STEREOTYPERS AND PRINTERS,  16 _Spruce St._ N.Y.          PREFACE.      All creation is musical--all nature speaks the language of song.        'There's music in the sighing of a reed,      There's music in the gushing of a rill;      There's music in _all things_, if man had ears;      The _earth_ is but an _echo_ of the spheres.'    And who is not moved by music? \"Who ever despises music,\" says Martin  Luther, \"I am displeased with him.\"        'There is a charm--a power that sways the breast,      Bids every passion revel, or be still;      Inspires with rage, or all our cares dissolves;      Can soothe _destruction_, and _almost soothes despair_.'    That music is capable of accomplishing vast good, and that it is a  source of the most elevated and refined enjoyment when rightly  cultivated and practiced, no one who understands its power or has  observed its effects, will for a moment deny.        'Thou, O music! canst assuage the pain and heal the wound      That hath defied the skill of sager comforters;      Thou dost restrain each wild emotion,      Thou dost the rage of fiercest passions chill,      Or lightest up the flames of holy fire,      As through the soul thy strains harmonious thrill.    Who does not desire to see the day when music in this country,  _cultivated and practised by_ ALL--music of a chaste, refined and  elevated style, shall go forth with its angel voice, like a spirit of  love upon the wind, exerting upon all classes of society a rich and  healthful moral influence. When its wonderful power shall be made to  subserve every righteous cause--to aid every humane effort for the  promotion of man's social, civil and religious well-being.    It has been observed by travellers, that after a short residence in  almost any of the cities of the eastern world, one would fancy \"every  second person a musician.\" During the night, the streets of these  cities, particularly Rome, the capitol of Italy, are filled with all  sorts of minstrelsy, and the ear is agreeably greeted with a perpetual  confluence of sweet sounds. A Scotch traveller, in passing through one  of the most delightful villas of Rome, overheard a stonemason chanting  something in a strain of peculiar melancholy; and on inquiry,  ascertained it to be the \"_Lament of Tasso_.\" He soon learned that  this celebrated piece was familiar to all the common people. Torquato  Tasso was an Italian poet of great merit, who was for many years  deprived of liberty, and subjected to severe trials and misfortunes by  the jealousy and cruelty of his patron, the Duke of Ferrara. That  master-piece of music, so justly admired and so much sung by the high  and low throughout all Italy, had its origin in the wrongs of Tasso.  An ardent love of humanity--a deep consciousness of the injustice of  slavery--a heart full of sympathy for the oppressed, and a due  appreciation of the blessings of freedom, has given birth to the  poetry comprising this volume. I have long desired to see these  sentiments of love, of sympathy, of justice and humanity, so  beautifully expressed in poetic measure, embalmed in sweet music; so  that _all the people_--the rich, the poor, the young, and the old, who  have hearts to feel, and tongues to move, may sing of the wrongs of  slavery, and the blessings of liberty, until every human being shall  recognise in his fellow an _equal_;--\"a MAN and a BROTHER.\" Until by  familiarity with these sentiments, and their influence upon their  _hearts_, _the people_, whose _duty it is_, shall \"undo the heavy  burdens and let the oppressed go free.\"    I announced, sometime since, my intention of publishing such a work.  Many have been impatiently waiting its appearance. I should have been  glad to have issued it and scattered it like leaves of the forest over  the land, long ago, but circumstances which I could not control, have  prevented. I purpose to enlarge the work from time to time, as  circumstances may require.    Let associations of singers, having the love of liberty in their  hearts, be immediately formed in every community. Let them study  thoroughly, and make themselves perfectly familiar with both the  poetry and the music, and enter into the _sentiment_ of the piece they  perform, that they may _impress it_ upon their hearers. Above all  things, let the enunciation of every word be _clear_ and _distinct_.  Most of the singing of the present day, is entirely too artificial,  stiff and mechanical. It should be easy and natural; flowing directly  from the soul of the performer, without affectation or display; and  then singing will answer its true end, and not only please the _ear_,  but affect and improve the _heart_.    To the true friends of universal freedom, the LIBERTY MINSTREL is  respectfully dedicated.    G.W. CLARK.    NEW YORK, Oct. 1844.          THE    LIBERTY MINSTREL.          GONE, SOLD AND GONE.    Words by Whittier. Music by G.W. Clark.      [Music]        Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,  Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,  Where the noisome insect stings,  Where the fever demon strews  Poison with the falling dews,  Where the sickly sunbeams glare  Through the hot and misty air,      Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia's hills and waters,      Woe is me my stolen daughters!        Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,  There no mother's eye is near them,  There no mother's ear can hear them;  Never when the torturing lash  Seams their back with many a gash,  Shall a mother's kindness bless them,  Or a mother's arms caress them.      Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia's hills and waters,      Woe is me my stolen daughters!        Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,  Oh, when weary, sad, and slow,  From the fields at night they go,  Faint with toil, and rack'd with pain,  To their cheerless homes again--  There no brother's voice shall greet them--  There no father's welcome meet them.--_Gone, &c._        Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,  From the tree whose shadow lay  On their childhood's place of play--  From the cool spring where they drank--  Rock, and hill, and rivulet bank--  From the solemn house of prayer,  And the holy counsels there.--_Gone, &c._        Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,  Toiling through the weary day,  And at night the Spoiler's prey;  Oh, that they had earlier died,  Sleeping calmly, side by side,  Where the tyrant's power is o'er,  And the fetter galls no more!--_Gone, &c._        Gone, gone--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,  By the holy love He beareth--  By the bruised reed He spareth--  Oh, may He, to whom alone  All their cruel wrongs are known,  Still their hope and refuge prove,  With a more than mother's love.--_Gone, &c._          WHAT MEANS THAT SAD AND DISMAL LOOK?    Words by Geo. Russell. Arranged from \"Near the Lake,\" by G.W.C.      [Music]    What means that sad and dismal look,    And why those falling tears?  No voice is heard, no word is spoke,    Yet nought but grief appears.    Ah! Mother, hast thou ever known    The pain of parting ties?  Was ever infant from thee torn    And sold before thine eyes?    Say, would not grief _thy_ bosom swell?    _Thy_ tears like rivers flow?  Should some rude ruffian seize and sell    The child thou lovest so?    There's feeling in a _Mother's_ breast,    Though _colored_ be her skin!  And though at Slavery's foul behest,    She must not weep for kin.    I had a lovely, smiling child,    It sat upon my knee;  And oft a tedious hour beguiled,    With merry heart of glee.    That child was from my bosom torn,    And sold before my eyes;  With outstretched arms, and looks forlorn,    It uttered piteous cries.    Mother! dear Mother!--take, O take    Thy helpless little one!  Ah! then I thought my heart would break;    My child--my child was gone.    Long, long ago, my child they stole,    But yet my grief remains;  These tears flow freely--and my soul    In bitterness complains.    Then ask not why \"my dismal look,\"    Nor why my \"falling tears,\"  Such wrongs, what human heart can brook?    No hope for me appears.          The Slave Boy's Wish.    BY ELIZA LEE FOLLEN.      I wish I was that little bird,    Up in the bright blue sky;  That sings and flies just where he will,    And no one asks him why.    I wish I was that little brook,    That runs so swift along;  Through pretty flowers and shining stones,    Singing a merry song.    I wish I was that butterfly,    Without a thought or care;  Sporting my pretty, brilliant wings,    Like a flower in the air.    I wish I was that wild, wild deer,    I saw the other"]]]
