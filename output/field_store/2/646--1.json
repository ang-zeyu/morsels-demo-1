Those portions of the Appendix which serve to  illustrate the text are inserted in their appropriate places as  footnotes. That part of the Appendix which is of special interest only  to the Sanscrit scholar is omitted.    Professor Max Mueller writes in this book not as a theologian but as a  scholar, not intending either to attack or defend Christian theology.  His style is charming, because he always writes with freedom and  animation. In some passages possibly his language might be  misunderstood. We have thought it best to add a few notes. The notes  of the American editor are signed \"A.W.;\" ours, \"Am. Pubs.\"           *       *       *       *       *          DEDICATED    TO    E. B. COWELL M.A., LL.D.,    PROFESSOR OF SANSKRIT AND FELLOW OF CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE IN THE    UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.           *       *       *       *       *          MY DEAR COWELL: As these Lectures would never have been written or  delivered but for your hearty encouragement, I hope you will now allow  me to dedicate them to you, not only as a token of my sincere  admiration of your great achievements as an Oriental scholar, but also  as a memorial of our friendship, now more than thirty years old, a  friendship which has grown from year to year, has weathered many a  storm, and will last, I trust, for what to both of us may remain of  our short passage from shore to shore.    I must add, however, that in dedicating these Lectures to you, I do  not wish to throw upon you any responsibility for the views which I  have put forward in them. I know that you do not agree with some of my  views on the ancient religion and literature of India, and I am well  aware that with regard to the recent date which I have assigned to the  whole of what is commonly called the Classical Sanskrit Literature, I  stand almost alone. No, if friendship can claim any voice in the  courts of science and literature, let me assure you that I shall  consider your outspoken criticism of my Lectures as the very best  proof of your true and honest friendship. I have through life  considered it the greatest honor if real scholars, I mean men not only  of learning, but of judgment and character, have considered my  writings worthy of a severe and searching criticism; and I have cared  far more for the production of one single new fact, though it spoke  against me, than for any amount of empty praise or empty abuse.  Sincere devotion to his studies and an unswerving love of truth ought  to furnish the true scholar with an armor impermeable to flattery or  abuse, and with a visor that shuts out no ray of light, from whatever  quarter it may come. More light, more truth, more facts, more  combination of facts, these are his quest. And if in that quest he  fails, as many have failed before him, he knows that in the search for  truth failures are sometimes the condition of victory, and the true  conquerors often those whom the world calls the vanquished.    You know better than anybody else the present state of Sanskrit  scholarship. You know that at present and for some time to come  Sanskrit scholarship means discovery and conquest. Every one of your  own works marks a real advance, and a permanent occupation of new  ground. But you know also how small a strip has as yet been explored  of the vast continent of Sanskrit literature, and how much still  remains _terra incognita_. No doubt this exploring work is  troublesome, and often disappointing, but young students must learn  the truth of a remark lately made by a distinguished member of the  Indian Civil Service, whose death we all deplore, Dr. Burnell, \"that  no trouble is thrown away which saves trouble to others.\" We want men  who will work hard, even at the risk of seeing their labors  unrequited; we want strong and bold men who are not afraid of storms  and shipwrecks. The worst sailors are not those who suffer shipwreck,  but those who only dabble in puddles and are afraid of wetting their  feet.    It is easy now to criticise the labors of Sir William Jones, Thomas  Colebrooke, and Horace Hayman Wilson, but what would have become of  Sanskrit scholarship if they had not rushed in where even now so many  fear to tread? and what will become of Sanskrit scholarship if their  conquests are forever to mark the limits of our knowledge? You know  best that there is more to be discovered in Sanskrit literature than  Nalas and _S_akuntalas, and surely the young men who every year go out  to India are not deficient in the spirit of enterprise, or even of  adventure? Why, then, should it be said that the race of bold  explorers, who once rendered the name of the Indian Civil Service  illustrious over the whole world, has well-nigh become extinct, and  that England, which offers the strongest incentives and the most  brilliant opportunities for the study of the ancient language,  literature, and history of India, is no longer in the van of Sanskrit  scholarship?    If some of the young candidates for the Indian Civil Service who  listened to my Lectures, quietly made up their minds that such a  reproach shall be wiped out, if a few of them at least determined to  follow in the footsteps of Sir William Jones, and to show to the world  that Englishmen who have been able to achieve by pluck, by  perseverance, and by real political genius the material conquest of  India, do not mean to leave the laurels of its intellectual conquest  entirely to other countries, then I shall indeed rejoice, and feel  that I have paid back, in however small a degree, the large debt of  gratitude which I owe to my adopted country and to some of its  greatest statesmen, who have given me the opportunity which I could  find nowhere else of realizing the dreams of my life--the publication  of the text and commentary of the Rig-Veda, the most ancient book of  Sanskrit, aye of Aryan literature, and now the edition of the  translations of the \"Sacred Books of the East.\"    I have left my Lectures very much as I delivered them at Cambridge. I  am fond of the form of Lectures, because it seems to me the most natural  form which in our age didactic composition ought to take. As in ancient  Greece the dialogue reflected most truly the intellectual life of the  people, and as in the Middle Ages learned literature naturally assumed  with the recluse in his monastic cell the form of a long monologue, so  with us the lecture places the writer most readily in that position in  which he is accustomed to deal with his fellow-men, and to communicate  his knowledge to others. It has no doubt certain disadvantages. In a  lecture which is meant to be didactic, we have, for the sake of  completeness, to say and to repeat certain things which must be familiar  to some of our readers, while we are also forced to leave out  information which, even in its imperfect form, we should probably not  hesitate to submit to our fellow-students, but which we feel we have not  yet sufficiently mastered and matured to enable us to place it clearly  and simply before a larger public.    But the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. A lecture, by keeping a  critical audience constantly before our eyes, forces us to condense  our subject, to discriminate between what is important and what is  not, and often to deny ourselves the pleasure of displaying what may  have cost us the greatest labor, but is of little consequence to other  scholars. In lecturing we are constantly reminded of what students are  so apt to forget, that their knowledge is meant not for themselves  only, but for others, and that to know well means to be able to teach  well. I confess I can never write unless I think of somebody for whom  I write, and I should never wish for a better audience to have before  my mind than the learned, brilliant, and kind-hearted assembly by  which I was greeted in your University.    Still I must confess that I did not succeed in bringing all I wished  to say, and more particularly the evidence on which some of my  statements rested, up to the higher level of a lecture; and I have  therefore added a number of notes containing the less-organized matter  which resisted as yet that treatment which is necessary before our  studies can realize their highest purpose, that of feeding,  invigorating, and inspiriting the minds of others.

Minor typos have been corrected.          PREFACE      In offering this book to teachers of elementary chemistry the authors  lay no claim to any great originality. It has been their aim to prepare  a text-book constructed along lines which have become recognized as best  suited to an elementary treatment of the subject. At the same time they  have made a consistent effort to make the text clear in outline, simple  in style and language, conservatively modern in point of view, and  thoroughly teachable.    The question as to what shall be included in an elementary text on  chemistry is perhaps the most perplexing one which an author must  answer. While an enthusiastic chemist with a broad understanding of the  science is very apt to go beyond the capacity of the elementary student,  the authors of this text, after an experience of many years, cannot help  believing that the tendency has been rather in the other direction. In  many texts no mention at all is made of fundamental laws of chemical  action because their complete presentation is quite beyond the  comprehension of the student, whereas in many cases it is possible to  present the essential features of these laws in a way that will be of  real assistance in the understanding of the science. For example, it is  a difficult matter to deduce the law of mass action in any very simple  way; yet the elementary student can readily comprehend that reactions  are reversible, and that the point of equilibrium depends upon, rather  simple conditions. The authors believe that it is worth while to  present such principles in even an elementary and partial manner because  they are of great assistance to the general student, and because they  make a foundation upon which the student who continues his studies to  more advanced courses can securely build.    The authors have no apologies to make for the extent to which they have  made use of the theory of electrolytic dissociation. It is inevitable  that in any rapidly developing science there will be differences of  opinion in regard to the value of certain theories. There can be no  question, however, that the outline of the theory of dissociation here  presented is in accord with the views of the very great majority of the  chemists of the present time. Moreover, its introduction to the extent  to which the authors have presented it simplifies rather than increases  the difficulties with which the development of the principles of the  science is attended.    The oxygen standard for atomic weights has been adopted throughout the  text. The International Committee, to which is assigned the duty of  yearly reporting a revised list of the atomic weights of the elements,  has adopted this standard for their report, and there is no longer any  authority for the older hydrogen standard. The authors do not believe  that the adoption of the oxygen standard introduces any real  difficulties in making perfectly clear the methods by which atomic  weights are calculated.    The problems appended to the various chapters have been chosen with a  view not only of fixing the principles developed in the text in the mind  of the student, but also of enabling him to answer such questions as  arise in his laboratory work. They are, therefore, more or less  practical in character. It is not necessary that all of them should be  solved, though with few exceptions the lists are not long. The answers  to the questions are not directly given in the text as a rule, but can  be inferred from the statements made. They therefore require independent  thought on the part of the student.    With very few exceptions only such experiments are included in the text  as cannot be easily carried out by the student. It is expected that  these will be performed by the teacher at the lecture table. Directions  for laboratory work by the student are published in a separate volume.    While the authors believe that the most important function of the  elementary text is to develop the principles of the science, they  recognize the importance of some discussion of the practical application  of these principles to our everyday life. Considerable space is  therefore devoted to this phase of chemistry. The teacher should  supplement this discussion whenever possible by having the class visit  different factories where chemical processes are employed.    Although this text is now for the first time offered to teachers of  elementary chemistry, it has nevertheless been used by a number of  teachers during the past three years. The present edition has been  largely rewritten in the light of the criticisms offered, and we desire  to express our thanks to the many teachers who have helped us in this  respect, especially to Dr. William Lloyd Evans of this laboratory, a  teacher of wide experience, for his continued interest and helpfulness.  We also very cordially solicit correspondence with teachers who may find  difficulties or inaccuracies in the text.    The authors wish to make acknowledgments for the photographs and  engravings of eminent chemists from which the cuts included in the text  were taken; to Messrs. Elliott and Fry, London, England, for that of  Ramsay; to The Macmillan Company for those of Davy and Dalton, taken  from the Century Science Series; to the L. E. Knott Apparatus Company,  Boston, for that of Bunsen.
