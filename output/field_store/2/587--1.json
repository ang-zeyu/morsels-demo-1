BY WILLIAM H. HOLMES.          INTRODUCTORY.    For the investigation of art in its early stages and in its widest  sense--there is probably no fairer field than that afforded by  aboriginal America, ancient and modern.    At the period of discovery, art at a number of places on the American  continent seems to have been developing surely and steadily, through the  force of the innate genius of the race, and the more advanced nations  were already approaching the threshold of civilization; at the same time  their methods were characterized by great simplicity, and their art  products are, as a consequence, exceptionally homogeneous.    The advent of European civilization checked the current of growth, and  new and conflicting elements were introduced necessarily disastrous to  the native development.    There is much, however, in the art of living tribes, especially of those  least influenced by the whites, capable of throwing light upon the  obscure passages of precolumbian art. By supplementing the study of the  prehistoric by that of historic art, which is still in many cases in its  incipient stages, we may hope to penetrate deeply into the secrets of  the past.    The advantages of this field, as compared with Greece, Egypt, and the  Orient, will be apparent when we remember that the dawn of art in these  countries lies hidden in the shadow of unnumbered ages, while ours  stands out in the light of the very present. This is well illustrated by  a remark of Birch, who, in dwelling upon the antiquity of the fictile  art, says that \"the existence of earthen vessels in Egypt was at least  coeval with the formation of a written language.\"[1] Beyond this there  is acknowledged chaos. In strong contrast with this, is the fact that  all precolumbian American pottery _precedes_ the acquisition of written  language, and this contrast is emphasized by the additional fact that it  also antedates the use of the wheel, that great perverter of the plastic  tendencies of clay.    [Footnote 1: Birch: History of Ancient Pottery, 1873, p. 8.]    The material presented in the following notes is derived chiefly from  the native ceramic art of the United States, but the principles involved  are applicable to all times and to all art, as they are based upon the  laws of nature.    Ceramic art presents two classes of phenomena of importance in the study  of the evolution of aesthetic culture. These relate, first, to _form_,  and second, to _ornament_.    _Form_, as embodied in clay vessels, embraces, 1st, _useful shapes_,  which may or may not be ornamental, and, 2d, _aesthetic shapes_, which  are ornamental and may be useful. There are also _grotesque_ and  _fanciful shapes_, which may or may not be either useful or ornamental.    No form or class of forms can be said to characterize a particular age  or stage of culture. In a general way, of course, the vessels of  primitive peoples will be simple in form, while those of more advanced  races will be more varied and highly specialized.    The shapes first assumed by vessels in clay depend upon the shape of the  vessels employed at the time of the introduction of the art, and these  depend, to a great extent, upon the kind and grade of culture of the  people acquiring the art and upon the resources of the country in which  they live. To illustrate: If, for instance, some of the highly advanced  Alaskan tribes which do not make pottery should migrate to another  habitat, less suitable to the practice of their old arts and well  adapted to art in clay, and should there acquire the art of pottery,  they would doubtless, to a great extent, copy their highly developed  utensils of wood, bone, ivory, and basketry, and thus reach a high grade  of ceramic achievement in the first century of the practice of the art;  but, on the other hand, if certain tribes, very low in intelligence and  having no vessel-making arts, should undergo a corresponding change of  habitat and acquire the art of pottery, they might not reach in a  thousand years, if left to themselves, a grade in the art equal to that  of the hypothetical Alaskan potters in the first decade. It is,  therefore, not the age of the art itself that determines its forms, but  the grade and kind of art with which it originates and coexists.    _Ornament_ is subject to similar laws. Where pottery is employed by  peoples in very low stages of culture, its ornamentation will be of the  simple archaic kind. Being a conservative art and much hampered by the  restraints of convention, the elementary forms of ornament are carried a  long way into the succeeding periods and have a very decided effect upon  the higher stages. Pottery brought into use for the first time by more  advanced races will never pass through the elementary stage of  decoration, but will take its ornament greatly from existing art and  carry this up in its own peculiar way through succeeding generations.  The character of the ornamentation does not therefore depend upon the  age of the art so much as upon the acquirements of the potter and his  people in other arts.            ORIGIN OF FORM      In order to convey a clear idea of the bearing of the preceding  statements upon the history of form and ornament, it will be necessary  to present a number of points in greater detail.    The following synopsis will give a connected view of various possible  origins of form.                    / By adventition.  Origin of form--| By imitation--------/ Of natural models.                  \\ By invention.       \\ Of artificial models      +FORMS SUGGESTED BY ADVENTITION.+    The suggestions of accident, especially in the early stages of art, are  often adopted, and become fruitful sources of improvement and progress.  By such means the use of clay was discovered and the ceramic art came  into existence. The accidental indentation of a mass of clay by the  foot, or hand, or by a fruit-shell, or stone, while serving as an  auxiliary in some simple art, may have suggested the making of a cup,  the simplest form of vessel.    The use of clay as a cement in repairing utensils, in protecting  combustible vessels from injury by fire, or in building up the walls of  shallow vessels, may also have led to the formation of disks or cups,  afterwards independently constructed. In any case the objects or  utensils with which the clay was associated in its earliest use would  impress their forms upon it. Thus, if clay were used in deepening or  mending vessels of stone by a given people, it would, when used  independently by that people, tend to assume shapes suggested by stone  vessels. The same may be said of its use in connection with wood and  wicker, or with vessels of other materials."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1996"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 2, Purgatory (#1)"],[1,"scanned by Dianne Bean of Phoenix, Arizona.

To run over better waters the little vessel of my genius now  hoists its sails, and leaves behind itself a sea so cruel; and I  will sing of that second realm where the human spirit is purified  and becomes worthy to ascend to heaven.    But here let dead poesy rise again, O holy Muses, since yours I  am, and here let Calliope somewhat mount up, accompanying my song  with that sound of which the wretched Picae felt the stroke such  that they despaired of pardon.[1]    [1] The nine daughters of Pieros, king of Emathia, who,  contending in song with the Muses, were for their presumption  changed to magpies.      A sweet color of oriental sapphire, which was gathering in the  serene aspect of the sky, pure even to the first circle,[1]  renewed delight to my eyes soon as I issued forth from the dead  air that had afflicted my eyes and my breast. The fair planet  which incites to love was making all the Orient to smile, veiling  the Fishes that were in her train.[2] I turned me to the right  hand, and fixed my mind upon the other pole, and saw four stars  never seen save by the first people.[3] The heavens appeared to  rejoice in their flamelets. O widowed northern region, since thou  art deprived of beholding these!    [1] By \"the first circle,\" Dante seems to mean the horizon.    [2] At the spring equinox Venus is in the sign of the Pisces,  which immediately precedes that of Aries, in which is the Sun.  The time indicated is therefore an hour or more before sunrise on  Easter morning, April 10.      When I had withdrawn from regarding them, turning me a little to  the other pole, there whence the Wain had already disappeared, I  saw close to me an old man alone, worthy in look of so much  reverence that no son owes more unto his father.[1] He wore a  long beard and mingled with white hair, like his locks, of which  a double list fell upon his breast. The rays of the four holy  stars so adorned his face with light, that I saw him, as if the  sun had been in front.    [1] These stars are the symbols of the four Cardinal Virtues,--  Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, and Justice,--the virtues of  active life, sufficient to guide men in the right path, but not  to bring them to Paradise. By the first people arc probably meant  Adam and Eve, who from the terrestrial Paradise, on the summit of  the Mount of Purgatory, had seen these stars, visible only from  the Southern hemisphere. According to the geography of the time  Asia and Africa lay north of the equator, so that even to their  inhabitants these stars were invisible. Possibly the meaning is  that these stars, symbolizing the cardinal virtues, had been  visible only in the golden age.    This old man, as soon appears, is the younger Cato, and the  office here given to him of warden of the souls in the outer  region of Purgatory was suggested by the position assigned to him  by Virgil in the Aeneid, viii. 670. \"Secretosque pios, his dantem  jura Catonem.\"    It has been objected to Virgil's thus putting him in Elysium,  that as a suicide his place was in the Mourning Fields. A similar  objection may be made to Dante's separating him from the other  suicides in the seventh circle of Hell (Canto XIII.). \"But,\" says  Conington, \"Virgil did not aim at perfect consistency. It was  enough for him that Cato was one who from his character in life  might be justly conceived of as lawgiver to the dead.\" So Dante,  using Cato as an allegoric figure, regards him as one who, before  the coming of Christ, practised the virtues which are required to  liberate the soul from sin, and who, as be says in the De  Monarchia (ii. 5), \"that he might kindle the love of liberty in  the world, showed how precious it was, by preferring death with  liberty to life without it.\" This liberty is the type of that  spiritual freedom which Dante is seeking, and which, being the  perfect conformity of the human will to the will of God, is the  aim and fruition of nil redeemed souls.    In the region of Purgatory outside the gate, the souls have not  yet attained this freedom; they are on the way to it, and Cato is  allegorically fit to warn and spur them on.      \"Who are ye that counter to the blind stream have fled from the  eternal prison?\" said he, moving those venerable"]]]
