The ceremony of dsilyÃ­dje qaÃ§Ã l, or mountain chant--literally,  chant towards (a place) within the mountains--is one of a large number  practiced by the shamans, or medicine men, of the Navajo tribe. I have  selected it as the first of those to be described, because I have  witnessed it the most frequently, because it is the most interesting to  the Caucasian spectator, and because it is the best known to the whites  who visit and reside in and around the Navajo country. Its chief  interest to the stranger lies in the various public performances of the  last night. Like other great rites of the shamans, it has its secret  ceremonies of many days' duration in the medicine lodge; but, unlike the  others, it ends with a varied show in the open air, which all are  invited to witness. Another ceremony which I have attended, and which  the whites usually call the \"Ya[`y]bichy Dance\" (YÃ¨bitcai), has a final  public exhibition which occupies the whole night, but it is unvaried.  Few Europeans can be found who have remained awake later than midnight  to watch it. Such is not the case with the rite now to be described.  Here the white man is rarely the first to leave at dawn.    2. The appropriateness of the name dsilyÃ­dje or tsilgitce--towards  (a place) within the mountains--will be better understood from the myth  than from any brief description. \"Dsilyi`\" may well allude to mountains  in general or to the Carrizo Mountains in particular, to the place in  the mountains (paragraphs 9 and 38) where the originator of these  ceremonies (whom I often find it convenient to call \"prophet\") dwelt, or  to the name of the prophet (par. 41), or to all these combined. QaÃ§Ã l  signifies a sacred song or a collection of sacred songs. From the many  English synonyms for song I have selected the word chant to translate  qaÃ§Ã l. In its usual signification hymnody may be its more exact  equivalent, but it is a less convenient term than chant. The shaman, or  medicine man, who is master of ceremonies, is known as qaÃ§Ã li or  chanter--el cantador, the Mexicans call him. In order to keep in mind  his relationship to similar functionaries in other tribes I shall, from  time to time, allude to him as the priest, the shaman, or the medicine  man, following the example of other authors. To all ceremonies of a  character similar to this the term qaÃ§Ã l is applicable. It would seem  from this that the Navajo regard the song as the chief part of the  ceremony, but since the Americans, as a rule, regard all Indian  ceremonies as merely dances and call them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20840"],[0,"Rebel Spurs (#1)"],[1,"Spurs    Andre Norton        THE WORLD PUBLISHING COMPANY  CLEVELAND AND NEW YORK    _Published by_ The World Publishing Company  2231 West 110th Street, Cleveland 2, Ohio    _Published simultaneously in Canada by_ Nelson, Foster & Scott Ltd.    _First Edition_            Copyright (C) 1962 by Andre Norton        All rights reserved.

So when Drew Rennie, newly discharged from Forrest's  Confederate scouts, arrived leading everything he owned behind him--his  thoroughbred stud Shiloh, a mare about to foal, and a mule--he knew his  business would not be questioned. To anyone in Tubacca there could be only  one extraordinary thing about Drew, and that he could not reveal: his  name, Rennie.    Drew had come west from Kentucky to find a father he had thought dead  until the year before. Kinship with a man like Hunt Rennie, however--the  legendary Don Cazar, owner of a matchless range and prize stallions--was  not a claim to be made quickly or lightly. Posing as Drew Kirby the young  veteran contrived to get himself and his friend Anse hired as corral hands  at Rennie's Range, but he was hardly prepared for the suspicion and danger  which stood between him and his father. As hotheaded as his father, Drew  was ready to move on to California--until the day all proof of his Rennie  name was stolen from him, and his unwarranted arrest for horse-thieving  brought on the accusations of the one man whose trust he needed.    Andre Norton's _Ride Proud, Rebel!_ dramatically portrayed the last year  of the Confederacy, when brave men like Drew Rennie met defeat with honor.  In this sequel, Drew's struggle to establish his identity and begin life  anew in a raw, unsettled land reflects the courage of thousands of  rootless men set adrift by the Civil War.

EDITED BY ANDRE NORTON          Space Pioneers        Space Service              1      Even the coming of an autumn dusk could not subdue the color of this land.  Shadows here were not gray or black; they were violet and purple. The  crumbling adobe walls were laced by strings of crimson peppers, vivid in  the torch and lantern light. It had been this way for days, red and  yellow, violet--colors he had hardly been aware existed back in the cool  green, silver, gray-brown of Kentucky.    So this was Tubacca! The rider shifted his weight in the saddle and gazed  about him with watchful interest. Back in '59 this had been a flourishing  town, well on its way to prominence in the Southwest. The mines in the  hills behind producing wealth, the fact that it was a watering place on  two cross-country routes--the one from Tucson down into Sonora of Old  Mexico, the other into California--had all fed its growth.    Then the war.... The withdrawal of the army, the invasion of Sibley's  Confederate forces which had reached this far in the persons of Howard's  Arizona Rangers--and most of all the raiding, vicious, deadly, and  continual, by Apaches and outlaws--had blasted Tubacca. Now, in the fall of  1866, it was a third of what it had been, with a ragged fringe of  dilapidated adobes crumbling back into the soil. Only this heart core was  still alive in the dusk.    Smell, a myriad of smells, some to tickle a flat stomach, others to  wrinkle the nose. Under the rider the big stud moved, tossed his head,  drawing the young man's attention from the town back to his own immediate  concerns. The animal he rode, the two he led were, at first glance, far  more noticeable than the dusty rider himself.    His saddle was cinched about the barrel of a big gray colt, one that could  not have been more than five years old but showed enough power and  breeding to attract attention in any horse-conscious community. Here was a  thoroughbred of the same blood which had pounded race tracks in Virginia  and in Kentucky to best all comers. Even now, after weeks on the trail,  with a day's burden of alkali dust grimed into his coat, the stud was a  beautiful thing. And his match was the mare on the lead rope, plainly a  lady of family, perhaps of the same line, since her coat was also silver.  She crowded closer, nickered plaintively.    She was answered by an anxious bray from the fourth member of the party.  The mule bearing the trail pack was in ludicrous contrast to his own  aristocratic companions. His long head, with one entirely limp and  flopping ear, was grotesquely ugly, the carcass beneath the pack a bone  rack, all sharp angles and dusty hide. Looks, however, as his master could  have proven, were deceiving.    \"Soooo--\" The rider's voice was husky from swallowing trail grit, but it  was tuned to the soothing croon of a practiced horse trainer. \"Sooo--lady,  just a little farther now, girl....\"    From the one-story building on the rider's right a man emerged. He paused  to light a long Mexican cigarillo, and as he held the match to let the  sulfur burn away, his eyes fell upon the stallion. A casual interest  tightened into open appreciation as he stepped from under the  porch-overhang into the street.    \"That is some horse, sir.\" His voice was that of an educated gentleman.  The lantern at the end of the porch picked out the fine ruffled linen of  his shirt, a vest with a painted design of fighting cocks, and the wink of  gold buttons. The rather extravagant color of his clothing matched well  with the town.    \"I think so.\" The answer was short and yet not discourteous.    Again the mare voiced her complaint, and the rider turned to the  gentleman. \"There is a livery stable here, suh?\" Unconsciously he reverted  in turn to the rather formal speech pattern of another place and time.    The man in the painted vest had transferred his attention from stallion to  mare. \"Yes. Quickest way is down this alley. Tobe Kells owns it. He's a  tolerable vet, too. She's near her time, ain't she?\"    \"Yes.\" The rider raised one finger to the straight wide brim of his  low-crowned black hat. He was already turning his mount when the townsman  added:    \"No hotel here, stranger. But the Four Jacks serves a pretty good meal and  keeps a couple of beds for overnighters. You're welcome back when you've  settled the little lady. She Virginia stock?\"    \"Kentucky,\" the rider answered, and then his lips tightened into a  compressed line. Was it a mistake to admit even that much? He would have  to watch every word he said in this town. He tugged gently at the lead  rope and walked Shiloh ahead at a pace which did not urge Shadow to any  great effort. The mule, Croaker, fell in behind her so that they were  strung out in the familiar pattern which had been theirs clear from Texas.    Minutes later her owner was rubbing down the fretful Shadow, murmuring the  soothing words to quiet her. The lean, gray-haired man who had ushered  them into the stable stood eyeing the mare's distended sides.    \"I'd say, young fellow, you didn't git her here a mite too soon, no,  siree. She's due right quick. Carryin' a blood foal, I'm thinkin'--\"    \"Yes. How soon? Tonight?\"    Tobe Kells made a quick examination. The mare, after a first nervous  start, stood easy under his sure and gentle hands. \"Late, maybe. First  foal?\"    \"Yes.\" Her owner hesitated and then added, \"You give me a hand with her?\"    \"You bet, son. She's a pretty thing, an' she's been a far piece, I'd say.  Now you looky here, boy--you sure look like you could take some curryin'  an' corn fodder under your belt too. You git over to th' Four Jacks.  Topham's got him a Chinee cookin' there who serves up th' best danged grub  in this here town. Fill up your belly an' take some ease. Then if we do  have this little lady gittin' us up tonight, you'll be ready for it. I'll  see t' th' stud an' th' mule. That colt's not a wild one.\" Kells surveyed  Shiloh knowingly. \"No, I seed he was gentle-trained when you come in.\" He  ran his hand down Shiloh's shoulder, touched the brand. \"Spur R? That  ain't no outfit I heard tell of before.\"    \"From Eastern ... Texas--\" That much was true. All three animals had been  given the brand in the small Texas town where the wagon train had  assembled. And perhaps this was the time when he should begin building up  the background one Drew Kirby must present to Tubacca, Arizona Territory.  \"All right, I'll go eat.\" He picked up his saddlebags. \"You'll call me  if----\"    \"Sure, son. Say, I don't rightly know your name....\"    \"Drew Kirby.\"    \"Wal, sure, Kirby, Tobe Kells is a man o' his word. Iffen there's any  reason to think you'll be needed, I'll send Callie along for you. Callie!\"    At Kells' hail a boy swung down the loft ladder. He was wiry thin, with a  thick mop of sun-bleached hair and a flashing grin. At the sight of Shiloh  and Shadow he whistled.    \"Now ain't they th' purtiest things?\" he inquired of the stable at large.  \"'Bout th' best stock we've had here since th' last time _Don_ Cazar  brought in a"]]]
