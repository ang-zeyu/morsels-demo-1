The lamp burned softly  beneath its shade, limiting its circle of light to the intimacy of the  conversation, leaving scarcely distinct the capricious luxury of the  vast walls, cumbered with canvases, hangings, panoplies, surmounted by a  glass roof through which the sombre blue shades of the night penetrated  unhindered. The portrait of a woman, leaning slightly forward, as if to  listen, alone stood out a little from the shadow; young with intelligent  eyes, a grave and sweet mouth and a spirituel smile which seemed to  defend the husband's easel from fools and disparagers. A low chair  pushed away from the fire, two little blue shoes lying on the carpet,  indicated also the presence of a child in the house; and indeed from the  next room, within which mother and child had but just disappeared,  came occasional bursts of soft laughter, of childish babble; the  pretty flutterings of a nest going off to sleep. All this shed over the  artistic interior a vague perfume of family happiness which the poet  breathed in with delight:_    \"_Decidedly, my dear fellow?\" he said to his friend, \"you were in the  right. There are no two ways of being happy. Happiness lies in this and  in nothing else. You must find me a wife!_\"      THE PAINTER.    _Good Heavens, no! not on any account. Find one for yourself, if you are  bent upon it. As for me, I will have nothing to do with it._      THE POET.    _And why?_      THE PAINTER.    _Because--because artists ought never to marry._      THE POET.    _That's rather too good. You dare to say that, and the lamp does not  go out suddenly, and the walls don't fall down upon your head! But just  think, wretch, that for two hours past, you have been setting before me  the enviable spectacle of the very happiness you forbid me. Are you by  chance like those odious millionaires whose well-being is in-creased by  the sufferings of others, and who better enjoy their own fireside when  they reflect that it is raining out of doors, and that there are plenty  of poor devils without a shelter?_      THE PAINTER.    _Think of me what you will. I have too much affection for you to help  you to commit a folly--an irreparable folly._      THE POET.    _Come! what is it? You are not satisfied? And yet it seems to me that  one breathes in happiness here, just as freely as one does the air of  heaven at a country window._      THE PAINTER.    _You are right, I am happy, completely happy, I love my wife with all my  heart. When I think of my child, I laugh aloud to myself with pleasure.  Marriage for me has been a harbour of calm and safe waters, not one in  which you make fast to a ring on the shore, at the risk of rusting  there for ever, but one of those blue creeks where sails and masts are  repaired for fresh excursions into unknown countries, I never worked as  well as I have since my marriage. All my best pictures date from then._      THE POET.    _Well then!_      THE PAINTER.    _My dear fellow, at the risk of seeming a coxcomb, I will say that I  look upon my happiness as a kind of miracle, something abnormal and  exceptional. Yes! the more I see what marriage is, the more I look back  with terror at the risk I ran. I am like those who, ignorant of the  dangers they have unwittingly gone through, turn pale when all is over,  amazed at their own audacity._      THE POET.    _But what then are these terrible dangers?_      THE PAINTER.    _The first and greatest of all, is the loss or degradation of one's  talent. This should count, I think, with an artist. For observe that  at this moment, I am not speaking of the ordinary conditions of life. I  grant you, that in general marriage is an excellent thing, and that the  majority of men only begin to be of some account when the family circle  completes them or makes them greater. Often, indeed, it is necessary to  a profession. A bachelor lawyer cannot even be imagined. He would not  have the needful air of weight and gravity. But for all of us, painters,  poets, sculptors, musicians, who live outside of life, wholly occupied  in studying it, in reproducing it, holding ourselves always a little  remote from it, as one steps back from a picture the better to see it, I  say that marriage can only be the exception. To that nervous, exacting,  impressionable being, that child-man that we call an artist, a special  type of woman, almost impossible to find, is needful, and the safest  thing to do is not to look for her. Ah! how well our great Delacroix,  whom you admire so much, understood that! What a fine existence was his,  bounded by his studio wall, devoted exclusively to Art! I was looking  the other day at his cottage at Champrosay and the prim little garden  full of roses, where he sauntered alone for twenty years! It has the  calm and the narrowness of celibacy. Well now! think for a moment of  Delacroix married, father of a family, with all the preoccupations of  children to bring up, of money matters, of illnesses; do you believe his  work would have been the same?_      THE POET.    _You cite Delacroix, I reply Victor Hugo. Do you think that marriage  hampered him for instance, while writing so many admirable books?_      THE PAINTER.    _I think as a matter of fact, that marriage did not hamper him in  anything. But all husbands have not the genius that obtains pardon,  nor a halo of glory with which to dry the tears they cause to flow. It  cannot be very amusing to be the wife of a genius. There are plenty of  labourers' wives who are happier._      THE POET.    _A curious thing, all the same, this special pleading against marriage,  by a married man, who is happy in being so._      THE PAINTER.    _I repeat that I don't give myself as an example. My opinion is formed by  all the sad things I have seen elsewhere; all the misunderstandings  so frequent in the households of artists, and caused solely by their  abnormal life. Look at that sculptor who, in full maturity of age and  talent, has just exiled himself, leaving wife and children behind him.  Public opinion condemns him, and certainly I offer no excuse for him.  And, nevertheless, I can well understand how he arrived at such a point!  Here was a fellow who adored his art, and had a horror of the world, and  society. The wife, though amiable and intelligent, instead of shielding  him from the social obligations he loathed, condemned him for some  ten years to all the exactions they involved. Thus she induced him to  undertake a lot of official busts, horrible respectabilities in velvet  skull caps, frights of women utterly devoid of grace; she disturbed him  ten times a day with importunate visitors, and then every evening  laid out for him a dress suit and light gloves, and dragged him from  drawing-room to drawing-room. You will tell me he could have rebelled,  could have replied point-blank: \"No!\" But don't you know that the very  fact of our sedentary existences leaves us more than other men dependent  on domestic influence? The atmosphere of the home envelopes us, and if  some touch of the ideal does not lighten it, soon wearies and drags us  down. Moreover, the artist as a rule puts what force and energy he  has into his work, and after his solitary and patient struggles, finds  himself left with no will to oppose to the petty importunities of life.  With him, feminine tyrannies have free play. No one is more easily  conquered and subdued. Only, beware! He must not be made to feel the  yoke too heavily. If one day the invisible bonds with which he is  surreptitiously fettered are drawn too tight and arrest the artistic  effort, he will all at once tear them asunder, and, mistrusting his own  weakness, will fly like our sculptor, over the hills and far away._    _The wife of this sculptor was astounded at his flight. The unhappy  creature is still wondering: \"What can I have done to him?\" Nothing.  She simply did not understand him. For it is not enough to be good and  intelligent to be the true helpmate of an artist, A woman must also  possess infinite tact, smiling abnegation; and all this is found only by  a miracle in a young creature, curious though ignorant as regards life.  She is pretty, she has married a well-known man, received everywhere;  why should she not wish to show herself a little on his arm? Is it  not quite natural? The husband, on the contrary, growing intolerant  of society as his talent progresses, finding time short, and art  engrossing, refuses to be exhibited. Behold them both miserable, and  whether the man gives in or resists, his life is henceforward turned  from its course, and from its tranquillity. Ah! how many of these  ill-matched couples have I known, where the wife was sometimes  executioner, sometimes victim, but more often executioner, and nearly  always unwittingly so! The other evening I was at Dargenty's, the  musician. There were but a few guests, and he was asked to play. Hardly  had he begun one off those pretty mazurkas with a Polish rhythm, which  make him the successor of Chopin, when his wife began to talk, quite  low at first, then a little louder. By degrees the fire of conversation  spread. At the end of a minute I was the only listener. Then he shut the  piano, and said to me with a heart-rent smile: \"It is always like this  here--my wife does not care for music.\" Can you imagine anything more  terrible than to marry a woman who does not care for your art? Take my  word for it, my friend, and don't marry. You are alone, you are free;  keep as precious things, your liberty and your loneliness._  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Notes]    Here are the definitions of several unfamiliar (to me) words.    batmen    Soldier assigned to an officer as a servant.    batushka    Village priest.    drosky    Cart    felcher    Second-rate medical student or anyone with some medical knowledge.    hors de combat    Out of the fight; disabled; not able to fight.    junker    Aristocratic Prussian landholder devoted to militarism and    authoritarianism, providing the German military forces with many of    its officers.    knout    Whip with a lash of leather thongs, formerly used in Russia for    flogging criminals.

APPEAL MADE TO PEOPLE    The movement to make the state of Indiana economically and  agriculturally prepared for war, as recommended by Governor James P,  Goodrich, had its beginning in Marion county at a meeting of farmers and  those interested in soil cultivation held Saturday afternoon in the  criminal courtroom.    The necessity for the efficient utilization of all the soil resources of  Indiana were emphasized in addresses at the meeting, which was the  beginning of a plan to create a county-wide interest in the movement.    Another Meeting Monday.    The general idea of the need for greater food production, as outlined at  the meeting, will be crystallized into definite plans for meeting the  situation at a meeting called for Monday night, to be held in the  criminal court room. Representatives of commercial, labor and civic  bodies and organizations of all kinds are invited and requested to  attend the meeting Monday night and assist in the work.    Stirring appeals to the people of Indianapolis and the county to respond  to the agricultural need which this country faces in the present war  period were made by speakers, including:  Charles V. Fairbanks, formerly  Vice-president of the United States; the Rev. Frank L. Loveland, pastor  of the Meridian Street M. E. Church; H. Orme, president of the Better  Farming Association, and Ralph M. Gilbert, county agricultural agent.    Resolutions Adopted.    Resolutions were adopted at the meeting pledging the support of the  citizens of Marion county in all measures taken for the defense of the  nation and urging the people to respond to the resolutions prepared for  greater and efficient food production. The resolutions prepared by a  committee composed of Mord Gardner, Ralph C. Avery, Fred L., Smock, John  E. Shearer, C. C. Osborn, Grace May Stutsman, Charles P. Wright and Leo  Fesler were as follows:    \"Whereas, By joint resolution of congress and the proclamation of the  President, war has been declared on Germany, and    \"'Whereas, The President has earnestly appealed to all citizens to  support the government in every possible way, and our Governor has  called, for meetings in each county to plan preparedness in every  occupation. \"Resolved, That we, the citizens of Marion county, assembled  in meetings at the courthouse do loyally pledge the support...

COPYRIGHT 1920  BY  JOEL R. MOORE      PRESS OF  TOPPING-SANDERS COMPANY  DETROIT      To the men who in North Russia  died in battle and of wounds, or  of sickness due directly to hardship  and exposure, this book is  reverently dedicated.        To Our Comrades and Friends    To our comrades and friends we address these prefatory words. The book  is about to go to the printers and binders. Constantly while writing the  historical account of the American expedition, which fought the  Bolsheviki in North Russia, we have had our comrades in mind. You are  the ones most interested in getting a complete historical account. It is  a wonderful story of your own fighting and hardships, of your own  fortitude and valor. It is a story that will make the eyes of the home  folks shine with pride.    Probably you never could have known how remarkably good is the record of  your outfits in that strange campaign if you had not commissioned three  of your comrades to write the book for you. In the national army, we  happened to be officers; in civil life we are respectively, college  professor, lawyer, and public accountant, in the order in which our  names appear on the title page. But we prefer to come to you now with  the finished product merely as comrades who request you to take the book  at its actual value to you--a faithful description of our part in the  great world war. We are proud of the record the Americans made in the  expedition.    We think that nothing of importance has been omitted. Some sources of  information were not open to us--will be to no one for years. But from  some copies of official reports, from company and individual diaries,  and from special contributions written for us, we have been able to  write a complete narrative of the expedition. In all cases except a few  where the modesty of the writer impelled him to ask us not to mention  his name, we have referred to individuals who have contributed to the  book. To these contributors all, we here make acknowledgment of our debt  to them for their cordial co-operation. For the wealth of  photo-engravures which the book carries, we have given acknowledgment  along with each individual engraving, for furnishing us with the  photographic views of the war scenes and folk scenes of North Russia.  Most of them are, of course, from the official United States Signal  Corps war pictures.    When we started the book, we had no idea that it would develop into the  big book it is, a de luxe edition, of fine materials and fine  workmanship. We have not been able to risk a large edition. Only two  thousand copies are being printed. They are made especially for the boys  who were up there under the Arctic Circle, made as nice as we could get  them made. Of many of the comrades we have lost track, but we trust that  somehow they will hear of this book and become one of the proud  possessors of a copy. To our comrades and friends, we offer this volume  with the expectation that you will be pleased with it and that after you  have read it, you will glow with pride when you pass it over to a  relative or friend to read.
