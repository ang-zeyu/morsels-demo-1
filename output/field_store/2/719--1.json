The dates 1580-1625  given for his birth and death are conjectural inferences, about which  the best that can be said is that no known facts contradict them.    The first notice of Webster so far discovered shows that he was  collaborating in the production of plays for the theatrical manager,  Henslowe, in 1602, and of such collaboration he seems to have done  a considerable amount.  Four plays exist which he wrote alone,  \"The White Devil,\" \"The Duchess of Malfi,\" \"The Devil's Law-Case,\"  and \"Appius and Virginia.\"    \"The Duchess of Malfi\" was published in 1623, but the date of writing  may have been as early as 1611.  It is based on a story in Painter's  \"Palace of Pleasure,\" translated from the Italian novelist, Bandello;  and it is entirely possible that it has a foundation in fact.  In any  case, it portrays with a terrible vividness one side of the court  life of the Italian Renaissance; and its picture of the fierce quest  of pleasure, the recklessness of crime, and the worldliness of the  great princes of the Church finds only too ready corroboration in  the annals of the time.    Webster's tragedies come toward the close of the great series  of tragedies of blood and revenge, in which \"The Spanish Tragedy\"  and \"Hamlet\" are landmarks, but before decadence can fairly be said  to have set in.  He, indeed, loads his scene with horrors almost past  the point which modern taste can bear; but the intensity of his  dramatic situations, and his superb power of flashing in a single  line a light into the recesses of the human heart at the crises  of supreme emotion, redeems him from mere sensationalism, and places  his best things in the first rank of dramatic writing.          THE DUCHESS OF MALFI      Dramatis Personae:    FERDINAND [Duke of Calabria].  CARDINAL [his brother].  ANTONIO [BOLOGNA, Steward of the Household to the Duchess].  DELIO [his friend].  DANIEL DE BOSOLA [Gentleman of the Horse to the Duchess].  [CASTRUCCIO, an old Lord].  MARQUIS OF PESCARA.  [COUNT] MALATESTI.  RODERIGO, ]  SILVIO,   ] [Lords].  GRISOLAN, ]  DOCTOR.  The Several Madmen.    DUCHESS [OF MALFI].  CARIOLA [her woman].  [JULIA, Castruccio's wife, and] the Cardinal's mistress.  [Old Lady].    Ladies, Three Young Children, Two Pilgrims, Executioners,  Court Officers, and Attendants.               ACT I             SCENE I[1]           [Enter] ANTONIO and DELIO      DELIO.  You are welcome to your country, dear Antonio;    You have been long in France, and you return    A very formal Frenchman in your habit:    How do you like the French court?      ANTONIO.                          I admire it:    In seeking to reduce both state and people    To a fix'd order, their judicious king    Begins at home; quits first his royal palace    Of flattering sycophants, of dissolute    And infamous persons,--which he sweetly terms    His master's master-piece, the work of heaven;    Considering duly that a prince's court    Is like a common fountain, whence should flow    Pure silver drops in general, but if 't chance    Some curs'd example poison 't near the head,    Death and diseases through the whole land spread.    And what is 't makes this blessed government    But a most provident council, who dare freely    Inform him the corruption of the times?    Though some o' the court hold it presumption    To instruct princes what they ought to do,    It is a noble duty to inform them    What they ought to foresee.[2]--Here comes Bosola,    The only court-gall; yet I observe his railing    Is not for simple love of piety:    Indeed, he rails at those things which he wants;    Would be as lecherous, covetous, or proud,    Bloody, or envious, as any man,    If he had means to be so.--Here's the cardinal.           [Enter CARDINAL and BOSOLA]      BOSOLA.  I do haunt you still.      CARDINAL.  So.      BOSOLA.  I have done you better service than to be slighted thus.    Miserable age, where only the reward of doing well is the doing    of it!      CARDINAL.  You enforce your merit too much.      BOSOLA.  I fell into the galleys in your service:  where, for two    years together, I wore two towels instead of a shirt, with a knot    on the shoulder, after the fashion of a Roman mantle.  Slighted thus!    I will thrive some way.  Black-birds fatten best in hard weather;    why not I in these dog-days?      CARDINAL.  Would you could become honest!      BOSOLA.  With all your divinity do but direct me the way to it.    I have known many travel far for it, and yet return as arrant knaves    as they went forth, because they carried themselves always along with    them.  [Exit CARDINAL.] Are you gone?  Some fellows, they say,    are possessed with the devil, but this great fellow were able    to possess the greatest devil, and make him worse.      ANTONIO.  He hath denied thee some suit?      BOSOLA.  He and his brother are like plum-trees that grow crooked    over standing-pools; they are rich and o'erladen with fruit, but none    but crows, pies, and caterpillars feed on them.  Could I be one    of their flattering panders, I would hang on their ears like a    horseleech, till I were full, and then drop off.  I pray, leave me.    Who would rely upon these miserable dependencies, in expectation    to be advanc'd to-morrow?  What creature ever fed worse than hoping    Tantalus?  Nor ever died any man more fearfully than he that hoped    for a pardon.  There are rewards for hawks and dogs when they have    done us service; but for a soldier that hazards his limbs in a    battle, nothing but a kind of geometry is his last supportation.      DELIO.  Geometry?      BOSOLA.  Ay, to hang in a fair pair of slings, take his latter swing    in the world upon an honourable pair of crutches, from hospital    to hospital.  Fare ye well, sir:  and yet do not you scorn us;    for places in the court are but like beds in the hospital, where    this man's head lies at that man's foot, and so lower and lower.         [Exit.]      DELIO.  I knew this fellow seven years in the galleys    For a notorious murder; and 'twas thought    The cardinal suborn'd it:  he was releas'd    By the French general, Gaston de Foix,    When he recover'd Naples.      ANTONIO.                  'Tis great pity    He should be thus neglected:  I have heard    He 's very valiant.  This foul melancholy    Will poison all his goodness; for, I 'll tell you,    If too immoderate sleep be truly said    To be an inward rust unto the soul,    If then doth follow want of action    Breeds all black malcontents; and their close rearing,    Like moths in cloth, do hurt for want of wearing.             SCENE II[3]           ANTONIO, DELIO, [Enter SILVIO, CASTRUCCIO, JULIA, RODERIGO         and GRISOLAN]      DELIO.  The presence 'gins to fill:  you promis'd me    To make me the partaker of the natures    Of some of your great courtiers.      ANTONIO.                          The lord cardinal's    And other strangers' that are now in court?    I shall.--Here comes the great Calabrian duke.           [Enter FERDINAND and Attendants]      FERDINAND.  Who took the ring oftenest?[4]      SILVIO.  Antonio Bologna, my lord.      FERDINAND.  Our sister duchess' great-master of her household?    Give him the jewel.--When shall we leave this sportive action,    and fall to action indeed?      CASTRUCCIO.  Methinks, my lord, you should not desire to go to war    in person.      FERDINAND.  Now for some gravity.--Why, my lord?      CASTRUCCIO.  It is fitting a soldier arise to be a prince, but not    necessary a prince descend to be a captain.      FERDINAND.  No?      CASTRUCCIO.  No, my lord; he were far better do it by a deputy.      FERDINAND.  Why should he not as well sleep or eat by a deputy?    This might take idle, offensive, and base office from him, whereas    the other deprives him of honour.      CASTRUCCIO.  Believe my experience, that realm is never long in quiet    where the ruler is a soldier.      FERDINAND.  Thou toldest me thy wife could not endure fighting.      CASTRUCCIO.  True, my lord.      FERDINAND.  And of a jest she broke of[5] a captain she met full of    wounds:  I have forgot it.      CASTRUCCIO.  She told him, my lord, he was a pitiful fellow, to lie,    like the children of Ismael, all in tents.[6]      FERDINAND.  Why, there's a wit were able to undo all the    chirurgeons[7] o' the city; for although gallants should quarrel,    and had drawn their weapons, and were ready to go to it, yet her    persuasions would make them put up.      CASTRUCCIO.  That she would, my lord.--How do you like my Spanish    gennet?[8]      RODERIGO.  He is all fire.      FERDINAND.  I am of Pliny's opinion, I think he was begot    by the wind; he runs as if he were ballass'd[9] with quicksilver.      SILVIO.  True, my lord, he reels from the tilt often.      RODERIGO, GRISOLAN.  Ha, ha, ha!      FERDINAND.  Why do you laugh?  Methinks you that are courtiers    should be my touch-wood, take fire when I give fire; that is,    laugh when I laugh, were the subject never so witty.      CASTRUCCIO.  True, my lord:  I myself have heard a very good jest,    and have scorn'd to seem to have so silly a wit as to understand it.      FERDINAND.  But I can laugh at your fool, my lord.      CASTRUCCIO.  He cannot speak, you know, but he makes faces; my lady    cannot abide him.      FERDINAND.  No?      CASTRUCCIO.  Nor endure to be in merry company; for she says too much    laughing, and too much company, fills her too full of the wrinkle.      FERDINAND.  I would, then, have a mathematical instrument made    for her face, that she might not laugh out of compass.--I shall    shortly visit you at Milan, Lord Silvio.      SILVIO.  Your grace shall arrive most welcome.      FERDINAND.  You are a good horseman, Antonio; you have excellent    riders in France:  what do you think of good"]]]
