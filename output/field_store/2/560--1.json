CHAPTER I.    FERDINAND VON SCHILL.      Profound silence reigned in the valleys and gorges of Jena and  Auerstadt. The battles were over. The victorious French had marched to  Jena to repose for a few days, while the defeated Prussians had fled to  Weimar, or were wandering across the fields and in the mountains,  anxiously seeking for inaccessible places where they might conceal their  presence from the pursuing enemy.    A panic had seized the whole army. All presence of mind and sense of  honor seemed to be lost. Every one thought only of saving his life, and  of escaping from the conquering arms of the invincible French. Here and  there, it is true, officers succeeded by supplications and remonstrances  in stopping the fugitives, and in forming them into small detachments,  with which the commanders attempted to join the defeated and retreating  main force.    But where was this main army? Whither had the Prince of Hohenlohe  directed his vanquished troops? Neither the officers nor the soldiers  knew. They marched along the high-roads, not knowing whither to direct  their steps. But as soon as their restless eyes seemed to discern French  soldiers at a distance, the Prussians took to their heels, throwing  their muskets away to relieve their flight, and surrendering at  discretion when there was no prospect of escape. In one instance a troop  of one hundred Prussians surrendered to four French dragoons, who  conducted their prisoners to headquarters; and once a large detachment  hailed in a loud voice a few mounted grenadiers, who intended perhaps to  escape from their superior force, and gave the latter to understand, by  signals and laying down their arms, that they only wished to surrender  and deliver themselves to the French.    The Prussians had reached Jena and Auerstadt confident of victory, and  now had left the battle-field to carry the terrible tidings of their  defeat, like a host of ominously croaking ravens, throughout Germany.    The battle-field, on which a few hours previously Death had walked in a  triumphant procession, and felled thousands and thousands of bleeding  victims to the ground, was now entirely deserted. Night had thrown its  pall over the horrors of this Calvary of Prussian glory: the howling  storm alone sang a requiem to the unfortunate soldiers, who, with open  wounds and features distorted with pain, lay in endless rows on the  blood-stained ground.    At length the night of horror is over--the storm dies away--the thick  veil of darkness is rent asunder, and the sun of a new day arises pale  and sad; pale and sad he illuminates the battle-field, reeking with the  blood of so many thousands.    What a spectacle! How many mutilated corpses lie prostrate on the ground  with their dilated eyes staring at the sky--and among them, the happy,  the enviable! how many living, groaning, bleeding men, writhing with  pain, unable to raise their mutilated bodies from the gory bed of  torture and death!    The sun discloses the terrible picture hidden by the pall of night; it  illuminates the faces of the stark dead, but awakens the living and  suffering, the wounded and bleeding, from their benumbed slumber, and  recalls them to consciousness and the dreadful knowledge of their  wretched existence.    With consciousness return groans and wails; and the dreadful conviction  of their wretched existence opens their lips, and wrings from them  shrieks of pain and despair.    How enviable and blissful sleep the dead whose wounds bleed and ache no  longer! How wretched and pitiable are the living as they lie on the  ground, tortured by the wounds which the howling night wind has dried so  that they bleed no more! Those poor deserted ones in the valley and on  the hills the sun has awakened, and the air resounds with their moans  and cries and despairing groans, and heart-rending entreaties for  relief. But no relief comes to them; no cheerful voice replies to their  wails. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, had been placed in the ambulances,  and, during the sudden panic, the surgeons had left the battle-field  with them. But hundreds, nay thousands, remained behind, and with no one  to succor them!    From among the crowds of wounded and dead lying on the battle-field of  Auerstadt, rose up now an officer, severely injured in the head and arm.  The sun, which had aroused him from the apathetic exhaustion into which  he had sunk from loss of blood and hunger, now warmed his stiffened  limbs, and allayed somewhat the racking pain in his wounded right arm,  and the bleeding gash in his forehead. He tried to extricate himself  from under the carcass of his horse, that pressed heavily on him, and  felt delighted as he succeeded in loosing his foot from the stirrup, and  drawing it from under the steed. Holding with his uninjured left arm to  the saddle, he raised himself slowly. The effort caused the blood to  trickle in large drops from the wound in his forehead, which he  disregarded under the joyful feeling that he had risen again from his  death-bed, and that he was still living and breathing. For a moment he  leaned faint and exhausted against the horse as a couch; and feeling a  burning thirst, a devouring hunger, his dark, flaming eyes wandered  around as if seeking for a refreshing drink for his parched palate, or a  piece of bread to appease his hunger.    But his eye everywhere met only stiffened corpses, and the misery and  horror of a deserted battle-field. He knew that no food could be found,  as the soldiers had not, for two days, either bread or liquor in their  knapsacks. Hunger had been the ally that had paved the way for the  French emperor--it had debilitated the Prussians and broken their  courage.    \"I must leave the battle-field,\" murmured the wounded soldier; \"I must  save myself while I have sufficient strength; otherwise I shall die of  hunger. Oh, my God, give me strength to escape from so horrible a death!  Strengthen my feet for this terrible walk!\"    He cast a single fiery glance toward heaven, one in which his whole soul  was expressed, and then set out on his walk. He moved along slowly and  with tottering steps amid the rows of corpses, some of which were still  quivering and moaning, as death drew near, while others writhed and  wailed with their wounds. Unable to relieve their racking pains, and to  assist them in their boundless misery, it only remained for him to sink  down among them, or to avert his eyes, to close his ears to their  supplications, and escape with hurried steps from this atmosphere of  blood and putrefaction, in order to rescue his own life from the  clutches of death.    He hastened, therefore, but his tearful eyes greeted the poor sufferers  whom he passed on his way, and his quivering lips muttered a prayer for  them.    At length the first and most horrible part of this dreadful field was  passed, and he escaped from the chaos of the dead and wounded. That  part, across which he was walking now, was less"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19564"],[0,"The Pirates' Who's Who (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's note.

I do not deal here with the children of fancy; I believe that every man,  or woman too--since certain of the gentler sex cut no small figure at the  game--mentioned in this volume actually existed.    A time has come when every form of learning, however preposterous it may  seem, is made as unlaborious as possible for the would-be student.  Knowledge, which is after all but a string of facts, is being arranged,  sorted, distilled, and set down in compact form, ready for rapid  assimilation. There is little fear that the student who may wish in the  future to become master of any subject will have to delve into the  original sources in his search after facts and dates.    Surely pirates, taking them in their broadest sense, are as much entitled  to a biographical dictionary of their own as are clergymen, race-horses,  or artists in ferro-concrete, who all, I am assured, have their own \"Who's  Who\"? Have not the medical men their Directory, the lawyers their List,  the peers their Peerage? There are books which record the names and the  particulars of musicians, schoolmasters, stockbrokers, saints and  bookmakers, and I dare say there is an average adjuster's almanac. A peer,  a horse, dog, cat, and even a white mouse, if of blood sufficiently blue,  has his pedigree recorded somewhere. Above all, there is that astounding  and entertaining volume, \"Who's Who,\" found in every club smoking-room,  and which grows more bulky year by year, stuffed with information about  the careers, the hobbies, and the marriages of all the most distinguished  persons in every profession, including very full details about the lives  and doings of all our journalists. But on the club table where these books  of ready reference stand with \"Whitaker,\" \"ABC,\" and \"Ruff's Guide to the  Turf,\" there is just one gap that the compiler of this work has for a long  while felt sorely needed filling. There has been until now no work that  gives immediate and trustworthy information about the lives, and--so sadly  important in their cases--the deaths of our pirates and buccaneers.    In delving in the volumes of the \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" it  has been a sad disappointment to the writer to find so little space  devoted to the careers of these picturesque if, I must admit, often  unseemly persons. There are, of course, to be found a few pirates with  household names such as Kidd, Teach, and Avery. A few, too, of the  buccaneers, headed by the great Sir Henry Morgan, come in for their share.  But I compare with indignation the meagre show of pirates in that  monumental work with the rich profusion of divines! Even during the years  when piracy was at its height--say from 1680 until 1730--the pirates are  utterly swamped by the theologians. Can it be that these two professions  flourished most vigorously side by side, and that when one began to  languish, the other also began to fade?    Even so there can be no excuse for the past and present neglect of these  sea-adventurers. But a change is beginning to show itself. Increasing  evidence is to be found that the more intelligent portions of the  population of this country, and even more so the enlightened of the great  United States of America, are beginning to show a proper interest in the  lives of the pirates and buccaneers. That this should be so amongst the  Americans is quite natural, when it is remembered what a close intimacy  existed between their Puritan forefathers of New England and the pirates,  both by blood relation and by trade, since the pirates had no more  obliging and ready customers for their spoils of gold dust, stolen slaves,  or church ornaments, than the early settlers of New York, Massachusetts,  and Carolina.    In beginning to compile such a list as is to be found in this volume, a  difficulty is met at once. My original intention was that only pirates and  buccaneers should be included. To admit privateers, corsairs, and other  sea-rovers would have meant the addition of a vast number of names, and  would have made the work unwieldy, and the very object of this volume as a  book of ready reference would not have been achieved. But the difficulty  has been to define the exact meaning of a pirate and of a buccaneer. In  the dictionary a pirate is defined as \"a sea-robber, marauder, one who  infringes another's copyright\"; while a buccaneer is described as \"a  sea-robber, a pirate, especially of the Spanish-American coasts.\" This  seems explicit, but a pirate was not a pirate from the cradle to the  gallows. He usually began his life at sea as an honest mariner in the  merchant service. He perhaps mutinied with other of the ship's crew,  killed or otherwise disposed of the captain, seized the ship, elected a  new commander, and sailed off \"on the account.\" Many an honest seaman was  captured with the rest of his ship's crew by a pirate, and either  voluntarily joined the freebooters by signing their articles, or, being a  good navigator or \"sea-artist,\" was compelled by the pirates to lend them  his services. Others, again, were in privateer ships, which carried on a  legitimate warfare against the shipping of hostile countries, under a  commission or letter of marque.    Often the very commission or letter of marque carried about so jealously  by some shady privateer was not worth the paper it was written on, nor the  handful of dubloons paid for it. One buccaneer sailed about the South  Seas, plundering Spanish ships and sacking churches and burning towns,  under a commission issued to him, for a consideration, by the Governor of  a Danish West India island, himself an ex-pirate. This precious document,  adorned with florid scrolls and a big, impressive seal, was written in  Danish. Someone with a knowledge of that language had an opportunity and  the curiosity to translate it, when he found that all it entitled the  bearer to do was to hunt for goats and pigs on the Island of Hispaniola,  and nothing more.    When, at the conclusion of hostilities, peace was declared, the crew of a  privateer found it exceedingly irksome to give up the roving life, and  were liable to drift into piracy. Often it happened that, after a long  naval war, crews were disbanded, ships laid up, and navies reduced, thus  flooding the countryside with idle mariners, and filling the roads with  begging and starving seamen. These were driven to go to sea if they could  find a berth, often half starved and brutally treated, and always  underpaid, and so easily yielded to the temptation of joining some vessel  bound vaguely for the \"South Sea,\" where no questions were asked and no  wages paid, but every hand on board had a share in the adventure.    The buccaneers were a great source of piracy also. When a war was on hand  the English Government was only too glad to have the help of these daring  and skilful seamen; but when peace was declared these allies began to lead  to international complications, and means had to be taken to abolish them,  and to try and turn them into honest settlers in the islands. But when a  man has for years lived the free life, sailed out from Jamaica a pauper,  to return in six weeks or less with, perhaps, a bag of gold worth two,  three, or four thousand pounds, which he has prided himself on spending in  the taverns and gambling-hells of Port Royal in a week, how can he settle  down to humdrum uneventful toil, with its small profits? Thus he goes back  \"on the account\" and sails to some prearranged rendezvous of the \"brethren  of the coast.\"    To write a whole history of piracy would be a great undertaking, but a  very interesting one. Piracy must have begun in the far, dim ages, and  perhaps when some naked savage, paddling himself across a tropical river,  met with another adventurer on a better tree-trunk, or carrying a bigger  bunch of bananas, the first act of piracy was committed. Indeed, piracy  must surely be the third oldest profession in the world, if we give the  honour of the second place to the ancient craft of healing. If such a  history were to include the whole of piracy, it would have to refer to the  Phoenicians, to the Mediterranean sea-rovers of the days of Rome, who, had  they but known it,"]]]
