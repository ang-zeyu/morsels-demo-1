BEGINNING--MY EARLY LIFE AND CHARACTER--I THIRST FOR ADVENTURE IN  FOREIGN LANDS, AND GO TO SEA.    Roving has always been, and still is, my ruling passion, the joy of my  heart, the very sunshine of my existence.  In childhood, in boyhood, and  in man's estate I have been a rover; not a mere rambler among the woody  glens and upon the hill-tops of my own native land, but an enthusiastic  rover throughout the length and breadth of the wide, wide world.    It was a wild, black night of howling storm, the night on which I was  born on the foaming bosom of the broad Atlantic Ocean.  My father was a  sea-captain; my grandfather was a sea-captain; my great-grandfather had  been a marine.  Nobody could tell positively what occupation _his_  father had followed; but my dear mother used to assert that he had been  a midshipman, whose grandfather, on the mother's side, had been an  admiral in the Royal Navy.  At any rate, we knew that as far back as our  family could be traced, it had been intimately connected with the great  watery waste.  Indeed, this was the case on both sides of the house; for  my mother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages, and so  spent the greater part of her life upon the water.    Thus it was, I suppose, that I came to inherit a roving disposition.  Soon after I was born, my father, being old, retired from a seafaring  life, purchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast  of England, and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the  shores of that sea which had for so many years been his home.  It was  not long after this that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt  within me.  For some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength,  so that I came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby  knees by walking on them, and made many attempts to stand up and walk  like a man--all of which attempts, however, resulted in my sitting down  violently and in sudden surprise.  One day I took advantage of my dear  mother's absence to make another effort; and, to my joy, I actually  succeeded in reaching the doorstep, over which I tumbled into a pool of  muddy water that lay before my father's cottage door.  Ah, how vividly I  remember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in  the mud amongst a group of cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which  she stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body!  From this time forth my rambles became more frequent and, as I grew  older, more distant, until at last I had wandered far and near on the  shore and in the woods around our humble dwelling, and did not rest  content until my father bound me apprentice to a coasting-vessel and let  me go to sea.    For some years I was happy in visiting the seaports, and in coasting  along the shores, of my native land.  My Christian name was Ralph; and  my comrades added to this the name of Rover, in consequence of the  passion which I always evinced for travelling.  Rover was not my real  name; but as I never received any other, I came at last to answer to it  as naturally as to my proper name.  And as it is not a bad one, I see no  good reason why I should not introduce myself to the reader as Ralph  Rover.  My shipmates were kind, good-natured fellows, and they and I got  on very well together.  They did, indeed, very frequently make game of  and banter me, but not unkindly; and I overheard them sometimes saying  that Ralph Rover was a \"queer, old-fashioned fellow.\"  This, I must  confess, surprised me much; and I pondered the saying long, but could  come at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my  old-fashionedness lay.  It is true I was a quiet lad, and seldom spoke  except when spoken to.  Moreover, I never could understand the jokes of  my companions even when they were explained to me, which dulness in  apprehension occasioned me much grief.  However, I tried to make up for  it by smiling and looking pleased when I observed that they were  laughing at some witticism which I had failed to detect.  I was also  very fond of inquiring into the nature of things and their causes, and  often fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my mind.  But  in all this I saw nothing that did not seem to be exceedingly natural,  and could by no means understand why my comrades should call me \"an  old-fashioned fellow.\"    Now, while engaged in the coasting trade I fell in with many seamen who  had travelled to almost every quarter of the globe; and I freely confess  that my heart glowed ardently within me as they recounted their wild  adventures in foreign lands--the dreadful storms they had weathered, the  appalling dangers they had escaped, the wonderful creatures they had  seen both on the land and in the sea, and the interesting lands and  strange people they had visited.  But of all the places of which they  told me, none captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the Coral  Islands of the Southern Seas.  They told me of thousands of beautiful,  fertile islands that had been formed by a small creature called the  coral insect, where summer reigned nearly all the year round, where the  trees were laden with a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit, where the  climate was almost perpetually delightful; yet where, strange to say,  men were wild, bloodthirsty savages, excepting in those favoured isles  to which the Gospel of our Saviour had been conveyed.  These exciting  accounts had so great an effect upon my mind that, when I reached the  age of fifteen, I resolved to make a voyage to the South Seas.    I had no little difficulty, at first, in prevailing on my dear parents  to let me go; but when I urged on my father that he would never have  become a great captain had he remained in the coasting trade, he saw the  truth of what I said and gave his consent.  My dear mother, seeing that  my father had made up his mind, no longer offered opposition to my  wishes.  \"But, oh Ralph!\" she said on the day I bade her adieu, \"come  back soon to us, my dear boy; for we are getting old now, Ralph, and may  not have many years to live.\"    I will not take up my readers' time with a minute account of all that  occurred before I took my final leave of my dear parents.  Suffice it to  say that my father placed me under the charge of an old messmate of his  own, a merchant captain, who was on the point of sailing to the South  Seas in his own ship, the _Arrow_.  My mother gave me her blessing and a  small Bible; and her last request was that I would never forget to read  a chapter every day and say my prayers, which I promised, with tears in  my eyes, that I would certainly do.    Soon afterwards I went on board the _Arrow_, which was a fine, large  ship, and set sail for the islands of the Pacific Ocean.        CHAPTER TWO.    THE DEPARTURE--THE SEA--MY COMPANIONS--SOME ACCOUNT OF THE WONDERFUL  SIGHTS WE SAW ON THE GREAT DEEP--A DREADFUL STORM AND A FRIGHTFUL WRECK.    It was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her canvas to  the breeze and sailed for the regions of the south.  Oh, how my heart  bounded with delight as I listened to the merry chorus of the sailors  while they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor!  The captain  shouted; the men ran to obey; the noble ship bent over to the breeze,  and the shore gradually faded from my view; while I stood looking on,  with a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.    The first thing that struck me as being different from anything I had  yet seen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the  anchor on deck and lashing it firmly down with ropes, as if we had now  bid adieu to the land for ever and would require its services no more.    \"There, lass!\" cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of  the anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was  completed--\"there, lass, take a good nap now, for we sha'n't ask you to  kiss the mud again for many a long day to come!\"    And so it was.  That anchor did not \"kiss the mud\" for many long days  afterwards; and when at last it did, it was for the last time!    There were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were my special  favourites.  Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth  of eighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured, firm face.  He had had a  good education, was clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but  mild and quiet in disposition.  Jack was a general favourite, and had a  peculiar fondness for me.  My other companion was Peterkin Gay.  He was  little, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, and about fourteen years  old.  But Peterkin's mischief was almost always harmless, else he could  not have been so much beloved as he was.    \"Hallo, youngster!\" cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder  the day I joined the ship, \"come below and I'll show you your berth.  You and I are to be messmates; and I think we shall be good friends, for  I like the look o' you.\"    Jack was right.  He and I, and Peterkin afterwards, became the best and  staunchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves.    I shall say little about the first part of our voyage.  We had the usual  amount of rough weather and calm; also we saw many strange fish rolling  in the sea, and I was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of  flying-fish dart out of the water and skim through the air about a foot  above the surface.  They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them;  and one flying-fish, in its terror, flew over the ship, struck on the  rigging, and fell upon the deck.  Its wings were just fins elongated;  and we found that they could never fly far at a time, and never mounted  into the air like birds, but skimmed along the surface of the sea.  Jack  and I had it for dinner, and found it remarkably good.    When we approached Cape Horn, at the southern extremity "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net.

PREFACE      In the general advance of technical knowledge and research during the  last decade, the Soap Industry has not remained stationary. While there  has not perhaps been anything of a very revolutionary character, steady  progress has still been made in practically all branches, and the aim of  the present work is to describe the manufacture of Household and Toilet  Soaps as carried out to-day in an up-to-date and well-equipped factory.    In the more scientific portions of the book, an acquaintance with the  principles of elementary chemistry is assumed, and in this we feel  justified, as in these days of strenuous competition, no soap-maker can  hope to compete successfully with his rivals unless he has a sound  theoretical as well as practical knowledge of the nature of the raw  materials he uses, and the reactions taking place in the pan, or at  other stages of the manufacture. We also venture to hope that the work  may prove useful to Works' Chemists and other Analysts consulted in  connection with this Industry.    At the same time, in the greater part of the book no chemical knowledge  is necessary, the subject being treated in such a way that it is hoped  those who are not directly engaged in the manufacture of soap, but who  desire a general idea of the subject, will find it of value.    In the sections dealing with the composition and analysis of materials,  temperatures are expressed in degrees Centigrade, these being now almost  invariably used in scientific work. In the rest of the book, however,  they are given in degrees Fahrenheit (the degrees Centigrade being also  added in brackets), as in the majority of factories these are still  used.    As regards strengths of solution, in some factories the use of Baume  degrees is preferred, whilst in others Twaddell degrees are the custom,  and we have therefore given the two figures in all cases.    In the chapter dealing with Oils and Fats, their Saponification  Equivalents are given in preference to Saponification Values, as it has  been our practice for some years to express our results in this way, as  suggested by Allen in _Commercial Organic Analysis_, and all our  records, from which most of the figures for the chief oils and fats are  taken, are so stated.

INTRODUCTION.         _Definition of Soap--Properties--Hydrolysis--Detergent Action._      It has been said that the use of soap is a gauge of the civilisation of  a nation, but though this may perhaps be in a great measure correct at  the present day, the use of soap has not always been co-existent with  civilisation, for according to Pliny (_Nat. Hist._, xxviii., 12, 51)  soap was first introduced into Rome from Germany, having been discovered  by the Gauls, who used the product obtained by mixing goats' tallow and  beech ash for giving a bright hue to the hair. In West Central Africa,  moreover, the natives, especially the Fanti race, have been accustomed  to wash themselves with soap prepared by mixing crude palm oil and water  with the ashes of banana and plantain skins. The manufacture of soap  seems to have flourished during the eighth century in Italy and Spain,  and was introduced into France some five hundred years later, when  factories were established at Marseilles for the manufacture of  olive-oil soap. Soap does not appear to have been made in England until  the fourteenth century, and the first record of soap manufacture in  London is in 1524. From this time till the beginning of the nineteenth  century the manufacture of soap developed very slowly, being essentially  carried on by rule-of-thumb methods, but the classic researches of  Chevreul on the constitution of fats at once placed the industry upon a  scientific basis, and stimulated by Leblanc's discovery of a process for  the commercial manufacture of caustic soda from common salt, the  production of soap has advanced by leaps and bounds until it is now one  of the most important of British industries.    _Definition of Soap_.--The word soap (Latin _sapo_, which is cognate  with Latin _sebum_, tallow) appears to have been originally applied to  the product obtained by treating tallow with ashes. In its strictly  chemical sense it refers to combinations of fatty acids with metallic  bases, a definition which includes not only sodium stearate, oleate and  palmitate, which form the bulk of the soaps of commerce, but also the  linoleates of lead, manganese, etc., used as driers, and various  pharmaceutical preparations, _e.g._, mercury oleate (_Hydrargyri  oleatum_), zinc oleate and lead plaster, together with a number of other  metallic salts of fatty acids. Technically speaking, however, the  meaning of the term soap is considerably restricted, being generally  limited to the combinations of fatty acids and"]]]
