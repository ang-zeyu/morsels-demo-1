TALMAGE    One of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints      PUBLISHED BY THE CHURCH    SIXTH EDITION    TWENTY-EIGHTH TO THIRTIETH THOUSAND INCLUSIVE    Salt Lake City, Utah    Deseret Book Company    1922    Copyright    September 1915, December 1915, April 1916  and November 1916    By    JOSEPH F. SMITH    Trustee-in-Trust for the  Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints    Copyright, October, 1922    By    HEBER J. GRANT    Trustee-in-Trust for the  Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints      Printed in the United States of America          PREFACE.      The scope of the subject presented in this work is expressed on the  title page. It will be readily seen that the author has departed from  the course usually followed by writers on the Life of Jesus Christ,  which course, as a rule, begins with the birth of Mary's Babe and ends  with the ascension of the slain and risen Lord from Olivet. The  treatment embodied in these pages, in addition to the narrative of the  Lord's life in the flesh comprizes the antemortal existence and  activities of the world's Redeemer, the revelations and personal  manifestations of the glorified and exalted Son of God during the  apostolic period of old and in modern times, the assured nearness of the  Lord's second advent, and predicted events beyond--all so far as the  Holy Scriptures make plain.    It is particularly congruous and appropriate that the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints--the only Church that affirms authority  based on specific revelation and commission to use the Lord's Holy Name  as a distinctive designation--should set forth her doctrines concerning  the Messiah and His mission.    The author of this volume entered upon his welcome service under request  and appointment from the presiding authorities of the Church; and the  completed work has been read to and is approved by the First Presidency  and the Council of the Twelve. It presents, however, the writer's  personal belief and profoundest conviction as to the truth of what he  has written. The book is published by the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints.    A characteristic feature of the work is the guidance afforded by modern  scriptures and the explication of the Holy Writ of olden times in the  light of present day revelation, which, as a powerful and well directed  beam, illumines many dark passages of ancient construction.    The spirit of the sacredness inherent in the subject has been a constant  companion of the writer throughout his pleasing labor, and he reverently  invokes the same as a minister to the readers of the volume.

A WORLD IS BORN    by    LEIGH BRACKETT                [Illustration]    _The first ripples of blue fire touched Dio's men. Bolts of it fastened  on gun-butts, and knuckles. Men screamed and fell. Jill cried out as he  tore silver ornaments from her dress._            Mel Gray flung down his hoe with a sudden tigerish fierceness and stood  erect. Tom Ward, working beside him, glanced at Gray's Indianesque  profile, the youth of it hardened by war and the hells of the Eros  prison blocks.    A quick flash of satisfaction crossed Ward's dark eyes. Then he grinned  and said mockingly.    \"Hell of a place to spend the rest of your life, ain't it?\"    Mel Gray stared with slitted blue eyes down the valley. The huge sun of  Mercury seared his naked body. Sweat channeled the dust on his skin. His  throat ached with thirst. And the bitter landscape mocked him more than  Wade's dark face.    \"The rest of my life,\" he repeated softly. \"The rest of my life!\"    He was twenty-eight.    Wade spat in the damp black earth. \"You ought to be glad--helping the  unfortunate, building a haven for the derelict....\"    \"Shut up!\" Fury rose in Gray, hotter than the boiling springs that ran  from the Sunside to water the valleys. He hated Mercury. He hated John  Moulton and his daughter Jill, who had conceived this plan of building a  new world for the destitute and desperate veterans of the Second  Interplanetary War.    \"I've had enough 'unselfish service',\" he whispered. \"I'm serving myself  from now on.\"    Escape. That was all he wanted. Escape from these stifling valleys, from  the snarl of the wind in the barren crags that towered higher than  Everest into airless space. Escape from the surveillance of the twenty  guards, the forced companionship of the ninety-nine other  veteran-convicts.    Wade poked at the furrows between the sturdy hybrid tubers. \"It ain't  possible, kid. Not even for 'Duke' Gray, the 'light-fingered genius who  held the Interstellar Police at a standstill for five years'.\" He  laughed. \"I read your publicity.\"    Gray stroked slow, earth-stained fingers over his sleek cap of yellow  hair. \"You think so?\" he asked softly.    Dio the Martian came down the furrow, his lean, wiry figure silhouetted  against the upper panorama of the valley; the neat rows of vegetables  and the green riot of Venusian wheat, dotted with toiling men and their  friendly guards.    Dio's green, narrowed eyes studied Gray's hard face.    \"What's the matter, Gray? Trying to start something?\"    \"Suppose I were?\" asked Gray silkily. Dio was the unofficial leader of  the convict-veterans. There was about his thin body and hatchet face  some of the grim determination that had made the Martians cling to their  dying world and bring life to it again.    \"You volunteered, like the rest of us,\" said the Martian. \"Haven't you  the guts to stick it?\"    \"The hell I volunteered! The IPA sent me. And what's it to you?\"    \"Only this.\" Dio's green eyes were slitted and ugly. \"You've only been  here a month. The rest of us came nearly a year ago--because we wanted  to. We've worked like slaves, because we wanted to. In three weeks the  crops will be in. The Moulton Project will be self-supporting. Moulton  will get his permanent charter, and we'll be on our way.    \"There are ninety-nine of us, Gray, who want the Moulton Project to  succeed. We know that that louse Caron of Mars doesn't want it to, since  pitchblende was discovered. We don't know whether you're working for him  or not, but you're a troublemaker.    \"There isn't to be any trouble, Gray. We're not giving the  Interplanetary Prison Authority any excuse to revoke its decision and  give Caron of Mars a free hand here. We'll see to anyone who tries it.  Understand?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mel Gray took one slow step forward, but Ward's sharp, \"Stow it! A  guard,\" stopped him. The Martian worked back up the furrow. The guard,  reassured, strolled back up the valley, squinting at the jagged streak  of pale-grey sky that was going black as low clouds formed, only a few  hundred feet above the copper cables that ran from cliff to cliff high  over their heads.    \"Another storm,\" growled Ward. \"It gets worse as Mercury enters  perihelion. Lovely world, ain't it?\"    \"Why did you volunteer?\" asked Gray, picking up his hoe.    Ward shrugged. \"I had my reasons.\"    Gray voiced the question that had troubled him since his transfer.  \"There were hundreds on the waiting list to replace the man who died.  Why did they send me, instead?\"    \"Some fool blunder,\" said Ward carelessly. And then, in the same casual  tone, \"You mean it, about escaping?\"    Gray stared at him. \"What's it to you?\"    Ward moved closer. \"I can help you?\"    A stab of mingled hope and wary suspicion transfixed Gray's heart.  Ward's dark face grinned briefly into his, with a flash of secretive  black eyes, and Gray was conscious of distrust.    \"What do you mean, help me?\"    Dio was working closer, watching them. The first growl of thunder  rattled against the cliff faces. It was dark now, the pink flames of the  Dark-side aurora visible beyond the valley mouth.    \"I've got--connections,\" returned Ward cryptically. \"Interested?\"    Gray hesitated. There was too much he couldn't understand. Moreover, he  was a lone wolf. Had been since the Second Interplanetary War wrenched  him from the quiet backwater of his country home an eternity of eight  years before and hammered him into hardness--a cynic who trusted nobody  and nothing but Mel 'Duke' Gray.    \"If you have connections,\" he said slowly, \"why don't you use 'em  yourself?\"    \"I got my reasons.\" Again that secretive grin. \"But it's no hide off  you, is it? All you want is to get away.\"    That was true. It would do no harm to hear what Ward had to say.    Lightning burst overhead, streaking down to be caught and grounded by  the copper cables. The livid flare showed Dio's face, hard with worry  and determination. Gray nodded.    \"Tonight, then,\" whispered Ward. \"In the barracks.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Out from the cleft where Mel Gray worked, across the flat plain of rock  stripped naked by the wind that raved across it, lay the deep valley  that sheltered the heart of the Moulton Project.    Hot springs joined to form a steaming river. Vegetation grew savagely  under the huge sun. The air, kept at almost constant temperature by the  blanketing effect of the hot springs, was stagnant and heavy.    But up above, high over the copper cables that crossed every valley  where men ventured, the eternal wind of Mercury screamed and snarled  between the naked cliffs.    Three concrete domes crouched on the valley floor, housing barracks,  tool-shops, kitchens, store-houses, and executive quarters, connected by  underground passages. Beside the smallest dome, joined to it by a  heavily barred tunnel, was an insulated hangar, containing the only  space ship on Mercury.    In the small dome, John Moulton leaned back from a pile of reports, took  a pinch of Martian snuff, sneezed lustily, and said.    \"Jill, I think we've done it.\"    The grey-eyed, black-haired young woman turned from the quartzite window  through which she had been watching the gathering storm overhead. The  thunder from other valleys reached them as a dim barrage which, at this  time of Mercury's year, was never still.    \"I don't know,\" she said. \"It seems that nothing can happen now, and  yet.... It's been too easy.\"    \"Easy!\" snorted Moulton. \"We've broken our backs fighting these valleys.  And our nerves, fighting time. But we've licked 'em!\"    He rose, shaggy grey hair tousled, grey eyes alight.    \"I told the IPA those men weren't criminals. And I was right. They can't  deny me the charter now. No matter how much Caron of Mars would like to  get his claws on this radium.\"    He took Jill by the shoulders and shook her, laughing.    \"Three weeks, girl, that's all. First crops ready for harvest, first  pay-ore coming out of the mines. In three weeks my permanent charter  will have to be granted, according to agreement, and then....    \"Jill,\" he added solemnly, \"we're seeing the birth of a world.\"    \"That's what frightens me.\" Jill glanced upward as the first flare of  lightning struck down, followed by a crash of thunder that shook the  dome.    \"So much can happen at a birth. I wish the three weeks were over!\"    \"Nonsense, girl! What could possibly happen?\"    She looked at the copper cables, burning with the electricity running  along them, and thought of the one hundred and twenty-two souls in that  narrow Twilight Belt--with the fierce heat of the Sunside before them  and the spatial cold of the Shadow side at their backs, fighting against  wind and storm and heat to build a world to replace the ones the War had  taken from them.    \"So much could happen,\" she whispered. \"An accident, an escape....\"    The inter-dome telescreen buzzed its signal. Jill, caught in a queer  mood of premonition, went to it.    The face of Dio the Martian appeared on the screen, still wet and dirty  from the storm-soaked fields, disheveled from his battle across the  plain in the chaotic winds.    \"I want to see you, Miss Moulton,\" he said. \"There's something funny I  think you ought to know.\"    \"Of course,\" said Jill, and met her father's eyes. \"I think we'll see,  now, which"]]]
