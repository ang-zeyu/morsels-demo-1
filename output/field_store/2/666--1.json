There are four groups of these stories: seven about a school  called Parkhurst, detailing major events such as matches and boat races.    The second section consists of eleven discourses on different types of  boy, such as \"The Sneak\".  The third section contains twelve stories  about boys who have played their part in English History, such as the  two young \"Princes in the Tower\", Dick Whittington, Edward the Sixth,  and so on.    The final section consists of seven general stories of greater length  than the foregoing.    The whole book, though not really long, is quite amusing, though of  course very dated.  You'll enjoy it.  I personally prefer to listen to  these books.

CHAPTER ONE.    MY FIRST FOOTBALL MATCH.    It was a proud moment in my existence when Wright, captain of our  football club, came up to me in school one Friday and said, \"Adams, your  name is down to play in the match against Craven to-morrow.\"    I could have knighted him on the spot.  To be one of the picked  \"fifteen,\" whose glory it was to fight the battles of their school in  the Great Close, had been the leading ambition of my life--I suppose I  ought to be ashamed to confess it--ever since, as a little chap of ten,  I entered Parkhurst six years ago.  Not a winter Saturday but had seen  me either looking on at some big match, or oftener still scrimmaging  about with a score or so of other juniors in a scratch game.  But for a  long time, do what I would, I always seemed as far as ever from the  coveted goal, and was half despairing of ever rising to win my \"first  fifteen cap.\"  Latterly, however, I had noticed Wright and a few others  of our best players more than once lounging about in the Little Close,  where we juniors used to play, evidently taking observations with an eye  to business.  Under the awful gaze of these heroes, need I say I exerted  myself as I had never done before?  What cared I for hacks or bruises,  so only that I could distinguish myself in their eyes?  And never was  music sweeter than the occasional \"Bravo, young 'un!\" with which some of  them would applaud any special feat of skill or daring.    So I knew my time was coming at last, and only hoped it would arrive  before the day of the Craven match, the great match of our season--  always looked forward to as _the_ event of the Christmas term, when  victory was regarded by us boys as the summit of all human glory, and  defeat as an overwhelming disgrace.    It will therefore be understood why I was almost beside myself with  delight when, the very day before the match, Wright made the  announcement I have referred to.    I scarcely slept a wink that night for dreaming of the wonderful  exploits which were to signalise my first appearance in the Great  Close--how I was to run the ball from one end of the field to the other,  overturning, dodging, and distancing every one of the enemy, finishing  up with a brilliant and mighty kick over the goal.  After which I was to  have my broken limbs set by a doctor on the spot, to receive a perfect  ovation from friend and foe, to be chaired round the field, to be the  \"lion\" at the supper afterwards, and finally to have a whole column of  the _Times_ devoted to my exploits!  What glorious creatures we are in  our dreams!    Well, the eventful day dawned at last.  It was a holiday at Parkhurst,  and as fine a day as any one could wish.    As I made my appearance, wearing the blue-and-red jersey of a \"first  fifteen man\" under my jacket, I found myself quite an object of  veneration among the juniors who had lately been my compeers, and I  accepted their homage with a vast amount of condescension.  Nothing was  talked of during the forenoon but the coming match.  Would the Craven  fellows turn up a strong team?  Would that fellow Slider, who made the  tremendous run last year, play for them again this?  Would Wright select  the chapel end or the other, if we won the choice?  How were we off  behind the scrimmage?    \"Is Adams to be trusted?\"  I heard one voice ask.    Two or three small boys promptly replied, \"Yes\"; but the seniors said  nothing, except Wright, who took the opportunity of giving me a little  good advice in private.    \"Look here, Adams; you are to play half-back, you know.  All you've got  to take care of is to keep cool, and never let your eyes go off the  ball.  You know all the rest.\"    A lecture half an hour long could not have made more impression.  I  remembered those two hints, \"Keep cool, and watch the ball,\" as long as  I played football, and I would advise every half-back to take them to  heart in like manner.    At noon the Craven team came down in an omnibus, and had lunch in hall  with us, and half an hour later found us all in a straggling procession,  making for the scene of conflict in the Great Close.  There stood the  goals and the boundary-posts, and there was Granger, the ground-keeper,  with a brand-new lemon-shaped ball under his arm.    \"Look sharp and peel!\" cried our captain.    So we hurried to the tent, and promptly divested ourselves of our outer  garments, turned up the sleeves of our jerseys, and tied an extra knot  in our bootlaces.  As we emerged, the Craven men were making their  appearance on the ground in battle array.  I felt so nervous myself that  I could not, for the life of me, imagine how some of them could look so  unconcerned, whistling, and actually playing leapfrog to keep themselves  warm!    An officer in the Crimean War once described his sensation in some of  the battles there as precisely similar to those he had experienced when  a boy on the football field at Rugby.  I can appreciate the comparison,  for one.  Certainly never soldier went into action with a more solemn  do-or-die feeling than that with which I took my place on the field that  afternoon.    \"They've won the choice of sides,\" said somebody, \"and are going to play  with the wind.\"    \"Take your places, Parkhurst!\" shouted our captain.    The ball lies in the centre of the ground, and Wright stands ten yards  or so behind it, ready for the kick-off.  Of our fifteen the ten  forwards are extended in a line with the ball across the field, ready to  charge after it the moment it goes flying.  The two best runners of our  team are stationed quarter-back, where they can skirmish on the  outskirts of the scrimmage.  I am posted a little in rear of them at  half-back--an unusual post for so young a player, but one which was  accorded to me by virtue of my light weight and not inconsiderable  running powers.  Behind me are the two backs, on whom, when all else  fails, the issue of the conflict depends.  The Craven players are  similarly disposed, and waiting impatiently for our captain's kick.    \"Are you ready?\" he shouts.    Silence gives consent.    He gives a quick glance round at us, then springs forward, and in an  instant the ball is soaring high in the direction of the Cravens' goal  amid the shouts of onlooking friend and foe.    Our forwards were after it like lightning, but not before a Craven back  had got hold of it and run some distance in the direction of our goal.  He did not wait to be attacked, but by a clever drop-kick, a knack  peculiar to all good backs, sent it spinning right over the forwards'  heads into the hands of one of our quarter-backs.  He, tucking it under  his arm and crushing his cap on to his head, started to run.  Going  slowly at first, he steered straight for the forwards of the enemy till  within a pace or two of them, when he doubled suddenly, and amid the  shouts of our partisans slipped past them and was seen heading straight  for the Craven goal.  But although he had escaped their forwards, he had  yet their rearguard to escape, which was far harder work, for was not  one of that rearguard the celebrated Slider himself, who by his prowess  had last year carried defeat to our school; and the other, was it not  the stalwart Naylor, who only a month ago had played gloriously for his  county against Gravelshire?    Yet our man was not to be daunted by the prestige of these distinguished  adversaries, but held on his way pluckily, and without a swerve.  It was  a sight to see those two cunningly lay wait for him, like two spiders  for a fly.  There was nothing for it but to plunge headlong into their  web in a desperate effort to break through.  Alas! brave man!  Naylor  has him in his clutches, the Craven forwards come like a deluge on the  spot, our forwards pour over the Craven, and in an instant our hero and  the ball have vanished from sight under a heap of writhing humanity.    \"Down!\" cries a half-choked voice, from the bottom of the heap.  It was  rather an unnecessary observation, as it happens, but it served as a  signal to both parties to rise to their feet and prepare for a  \"scrimmage.\"    Now, if truth must be told, our school always had the reputation of  being second to none in \"going through a scrimmage,\" so while the  players are scrambling to their feet, and waiting for the ball to be  \"grounded,\" I will explain what our method of doing the thing was.    It was nothing more nor less than a carrying out of the principle of the  wedge.  The ball formed the apex; the fellows got up close to it, so as  never to let it out of reach of their four feet.  Behind these two came  three with locked arms, and behind the three, four.  The men in the  middle pushed straight ahead, and those at the sides inwards towards the  ball, while the two or three remaining forwards lent their weight to one  side or other of the base,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net              LOVE'S MEINIE.

BRANTWOOD, 9_th June_, 1881.    _Quarter past five, morning._    The birds chirping feebly,--mostly chaffinches answering each other,  the rest discomposed, I fancy, by the June snow;[1] the lake neither  smooth nor rippled, but like a surface of perfectly bright glass, ill  cast; the lines of wave few and irregular, like flaws in the planes of  a fine crystal.          [1] The summits of the Old Man, of Wetherlam, and Helvellyn,        were all white, on the morning when this was written.    I see this book was begun eight years ago;--then intended to contain  only four Oxford lectures: but the said lectures also 'intended' to  contain the cream of forty volumes of scientific ornithology. Which  intentions, all and sundry, having gone, Carlyle would have said, to  water, and more piously-minded persons, to fire, I am obliged now to  cast my materials into another form: and here, at all events, is a  bundle of what is readiest under my hand. The nature and name of which  I must try to make a little more intelligible than my books have lately  been, either in text or title.    'Meinie' is the old English word for 'Many,' in the sense of 'a many'  persons attending one, as bridesmaids, when in sixes or tens or  dozens;--courtiers, footmen, and the like. It passes gradually into  'Menial,' and unites the senses of Multitude and Servitude.    In the passages quoted from, or referred to in, Chaucer's translation  of the Romance of the Rose, at the end of the first lecture, any reader  who cares for a clue to the farther significances of the title, may  find one to lead him safely through richer labyrinths of thought than  mine: and ladder enough also,--if there be either any heavenly, or pure  earthly, Love, in his own breast,--to guide him to a pretty bird's  nest; both in the Romances of the Rose and of Juliet, and in the  Sermons of St. Francis and St. Bernard.    The term 'Lecture' is retained, for though I lecture no more, I still  write habitually in a manner suited for oral delivery, and imagine  myself speaking to my pupils, if ever I am happily thinking in myself.  But it will be also seen that by the help of this very familiarity of  style, I am endeavoring, in these and my other writings on Natural  History, to compel in the student a clearness of thought and precision  of language which have not hitherto been in any wise the virtues, or  skills, of scientific persons. Thoughtless readers, who imagine that my  own style (such as it is, the one thing which the British public  concedes to me as a real power) has been formed without pains, may  smile at the confidence with which I speak of altering accepted, and  even long-established, nomenclature. But the use which I now have of  language has taken me forty years to attain; and those forty years  spent, mostly, in walking through the wilderness of this world's vain  words, seeking how they might be pruned into some better strength. And  I think it likely that at last I may put in my pruning-hook with  effect; for indeed a time must come when English fathers and mothers  will wish their children to learn English again, and to speak it for  all scholarly purposes; and, if they use, instead, Greek or Latin, to  use them only that they may be understood by Greeks or Latins;[2] and  not that they may mystify the illiterate many of their own land. Dead  languages, so called, may at least be left at rest, if not honored; and  must not be torn in mutilation out of their tumuli, that the skins and  bones of them may help to hold our living nonsense together; while  languages called living, but which live only to slack themselves into  slang, or bloat themselves into bombast, must one day have new grammars  written for their license, and new laws for their insolence.          [2] Greek is now a living nation's language, from Messina to        Delos--and Latin still lives for the well-trained churchmen        and gentlemen of Italy.    Observe, however, that the recast methods of classification adopted in  this book, and in 'Proserpina,' must be carefully distinguished from  their recastings of nomenclature. I am perfectly sure that it is wiser  to use plain short words than obscure long ones; but not in the least  sure that I am doing the best that can be done for my pupils, in  classing swallows with owls, or milkworts with violets. The  classification is always given as tentative; and, at its utmost,  elementary: but the nomenclature, as in all probability conclusive.    For the rest, the success and the service of all depend on the more or  less thorough accomplishment of plans long since laid, and which would  have been good for little if their coping could at once have been  conjectured or foretold in their foundations. It has been throughout my  trust, that if Death should write on these, \"What this man began to  build, he was not able to finish,\" God may also write on them, not in  anger, but in aid,        \"A stronger than he, cometh.\"          LOVE'S MEINIE.    \"Il etoit tout convert d'oisiaulx.\"                               _Romance of the Rose._          LECTURE I.[3]    THE ROBIN.      1. Among the more splendid pictures in the Exhibition of the Old  Masters, this year, you cannot but remember the Vandyke portraits of  the two sons of the Duke of Lennox. I think you cannot but remember it,  because it would be difficult to find, even among the works of Vandyke,  a more striking representation of the youth of our English noblesse;  nor one in which the painter had more exerted himself, or with better  success, in rendering the decorous pride and natural grace of honorable  aristocracy.          [3] Delivered at Oxford, March 15th, 1873.    Vandyke is, however, inferior to Titian and Velasquez, in that his  effort to show this noblesse of air and persons may always be detected;  also the aristocracy of Vandyke's day were already so far fearful of  their own position as to feel anxiety that it should be immediately  recognized. And the effect of the painter's conscious deference, and of  the equally conscious pride of the boys, as they stood to be painted,  has been somewhat to shorten the power of the one, and to abase the  dignity of the other. And thus, in the midst of my admiration of the  youths' beautiful faces, and natural quality of majesty, set off by all  splendors of dress and courtesies of art, I could not forbear  questioning with myself what the true value was, in the scales of  creation, of these fair human beings who set so high a value on  themselves; and,--as if the only answer,--the words kept repeating  themselves in my ear, \"Ye are of more value than many sparrows.\"    2. Passeres, [Greek: strouthos]--the things that open their wings, and  are not otherwise noticeable; small birds of the land and wood; the  food of the serpent, of man, or of the stronger creatures of their own  kind,--that even these, though among the simplest and obscurest of  beings, have yet price in the eyes of their Maker, and that the death  of one of them cannot take place but by His permission, has long been  the subject of declamation in our pulpits, and the ground of much  sentiment in nursery education. But the declamation is so aimless, and  the sentiment so hollow, that, practically, the chief interest of the  leisure of mankind has been found in the destruction of the creatures  which they professed to believe even the Most High would not see perish  without pity; and, in recent days, it is fast becoming the only  definition of aristocracy, that the principal business of its life is  the killing of sparrows.    Sparrows, or pigeons, or partridges, what does it matter? \"Centum mille  perdrices plumbo confecit;\"[4] that is, indeed, too often the sum of  the life of an English lord; much questionable now, if _indeed_ of  more value than that of many sparrows.          [4] The epitaph on Count Zachdarm, in \"Sartor Resartus.\"    3. Is it not a strange fact, that, interested in nothing so much for  the last two hundred years, as in his horses, he yet left it to the  farmers of Scotland to relieve draught horses from the bearing-rein?[5]  Is it not one equally strange that, master of the forests of England  for a thousand years, and of its libraries for three hundred, he left  the natural history of birds to be written by a card-printer's lad of  Newcastle?[6] Written, and not written, for indeed we have no natural  history of birds written yet. It cannot be written but by a scholar and  a gentleman; and no English gentleman in recent times has ever thought  of birds except as flying targets, or flavorous dishes. The only piece  of natural history worth the name in the English language, that I know  of, is in the few lines of Milton on the Creation. The only example of  a proper manner of contribution to natural history is in White's  Letters from Selborne. You know I have always spoken of Bewick as  pre-eminently a vulgar or boorish person, though of splendid honor and  genius; his vulgarity shows in nothing so much as in the poverty of the  details he has collected, with the best"]]]
