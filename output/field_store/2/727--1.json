ARTHUR THOMSON    _Professor of Natural History in the University of Aberdeen_      In seeking to discover Darwin's relation to his predecessors it is  useful to distinguish the various services which he rendered to the  theory of organic evolution.    (I) As everyone knows, the general idea of the Doctrine of Descent is  that the plants and animals of the present day are the lineal  descendants of ancestors on the whole somewhat simpler, that these  again are descended from yet simpler forms, and so on backwards  towards the literal \"Protozoa\" and \"Protophyta\" about which we  unfortunately know nothing. Now no one supposes that Darwin originated  this idea, which in rudiment at least is as old as Aristotle. What  Darwin did was to make it current intellectual coin. He gave it a form  that commended itself to the scientific and public intelligence of the  day, and he won widespread conviction by showing with consummate skill  that it was an effective formula to work with, a key which no lock  refused. In a scholarly, critical, and pre-eminently fair-minded way,  admitting difficulties and removing them, foreseeing objections and  forestalling them, he showed that the doctrine of descent supplied a  modal interpretation of how our present-day fauna and flora have come  to be.    (II) In the second place, Darwin applied the evolution-idea to  particular problems, such as the descent of man, and showed what a  powerful organon it is, introducing order into masses of uncorrelated  facts, interpreting enigmas both of structure and function, both  bodily and mental, and, best of all, stimulating and guiding further  investigation. But here again it cannot be claimed that Darwin was  original. The problem of the descent or ascent of man, and other  particular cases of evolution, had attracted not a few naturalists  before Darwin's day, though no one [except Herbert Spencer in the  psychological domain (1855)] had come near him in precision and  thoroughness of inquiry.    (III) In the third place, Darwin contributed largely to a knowledge of  the factors in the evolution-process, especially by his analysis of  what occurs in the case of domestic animals and cultivated plants, and  by his elaboration of the theory of Natural Selection which Alfred  Russel Wallace independently stated at the same time, and of which  there had been a few previous suggestions of a more or less vague  description. It was here that Darwin's originality was greatest, for  he revealed to naturalists the many different forms--often very  subtle--which natural selection takes, and with the insight of a  disciplined scientific imagination he realised what a mighty engine of  progress it has been and is.    (IV) As an epoch-marking contribution, not only to AEtiology but to  Natural History in the widest sense, we rank the picture which Darwin  gave to the world of the web of life, that is to say, of the  inter-relations and linkages in Nature. For the Biology of the  individual--if that be not a contradiction in terms--no idea is more  fundamental than that of the correlation of organs, but Darwin's most  characteristic contribution was not less fundamental,--it was the idea  of the correlation of organisms. This, again, was not novel; we find  it in the works of naturalists like Christian Conrad Sprengel,  Gilbert White, and Alexander von Humboldt, but the realisation of its  full import was distinctly Darwinian.      _As Regards the General Idea of Organic Evolution_    While it is true, as Prof. H. F. Osborn puts it, that \"'Before and  after Darwin' will always be the _ante et post urbem conditam_ of  biological history,\" it is also true that the general idea of organic  evolution is very ancient. In his admirable sketch _From the Greeks to  Darwin_,[1] Prof. Osborn has shown that several of the ancient  philosophers looked upon Nature as a gradual development and as still  in process of change. In the suggestions of Empedocles, to take the  best instance, there were \"four sparks of truth,--first, that the  development of life was a gradual process; second, that plants were  evolved before animals; third, that imperfect forms were gradually  replaced (not succeeded) by perfect forms; fourth, that the natural  cause of the production of perfect forms was the extinction of the  imperfect.\"[2] But the fundamental idea of one stage giving origin to  another was absent. As the blue AEgean teemed with treasures of beauty  and threw many upon its shores, so did Nature produce like a fertile  artist what had to be rejected as well as what was able to survive,  but the idea of one species emerging out of another was not yet  conceived.    Aristotle's views of Nature[3] seem to have been more definitely  evolutionist than those of his predecessors, in this sense, at least,  that he recognised not only an ascending scale, but a genetic series  from polyp to man and an age-long movement towards perfection. \"It is  due to the resistance of matter to form that Nature can only rise by  degrees from lower to higher types.\" \"Nature produces those things  which, being continually moved by a certain principle contained in  themselves, arrive at a certain end.\"    To discern the outcrop of evolution-doctrine in the long interval  between Aristotle and Bacon seems to be very difficult, and some of  the instances that have been cited strike one as forced. Epicurus and  Lucretius, often called poets of evolution, both pictured animals as  arising directly out of the earth, very much as Milton's lion long  afterwards pawed its way out. Even when we come to Bruno who wrote  that \"to the sound of the harp of the Universal Apollo (the World  Spirit), the lower organisms are called by stages to higher, and the  lower stages are connected by intermediate forms with the higher,\"  there is great room, as Prof. Osborn points out,[4] for difference of  opinion as to how far he was an evolutionist in our sense of the term.    The awakening of natural science in the sixteenth century brought the  possibility of a concrete evolution theory nearer, and in the early  seventeenth century we find evidences of a new spirit--in the  embryology of Harvey and the classifications of Ray. Besides sober  naturalists there were speculative dreamers in the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries who had at least got beyond static formulae,  but, as Professor Osborn points out,[5] \"it is a very striking fact,  that the basis of our modern methods of studying the Evolution problem  was established not by the early naturalists nor by the speculative  writers, but by the Philosophers.\" He refers to Bacon, Descartes,  Leibnitz, Hume, Kant, Lessing, Herder, and Schelling. \"They alone were  upon the main track of modern thought. It is evident that they were  groping in the dark for a working theory of the Evolution of life, and  it is remarkable that they clearly perceived from the outset that the  point to which observation should be directed was not the past but the  present mutability of species, and further, that this mutability was  simply the variation of individuals on an extended scale.\"    Bacon seems to have been one of the first to think definitely about  the mutability of species, and he was far ahead of his age in his  suggestion of what we now call a Station of Experimental Evolution.  Leibnitz discusses in so many words how the species of animals may be  changed and how intermediate species may once have linked those that  now seem discontinuous. \"All natural orders of beings present but a  single chain\".... \"All advances by degrees in Nature, and nothing by  leaps.\" Similar evolutionist statements are to be found in the works  of the other \"philosophers,\" to whom Prof. Osborn refers, who were,  indeed, more scientific than the naturalists of their day. It must be  borne in mind that the general idea of organic evolution--that the  present is the child of the past--is in great part just the idea of  human history projected upon the natural world, differentiated by the  qualification that the continuous \"Becoming\" has been wrought out by  forces inherent in the organisms themselves and in their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Four days later the United States Government sent to Germany a  note of protest which has come to be known as the \"strict  accountability note.\" After pointing out that a serious infringement  of American rights on the high seas was likely to occur, should  Germany carry out her war-zone decree in the manner she had  proclaimed, it declared:         \"If such a deplorable situation should arise, the Imperial       German Government can readily appreciate that the Government       of the United States would be constrained to hold the       Imperial German Government to a strict accountability for       such acts of their naval authorities and to take any steps       it might be necessary to take to safeguard American lives       and property and to secure to American citizens the full       enjoyment of their acknowledged rights on the high seas.\"    The war-zone decree went into effect on Feb. 18. Two days later  dispatches were cabled to Ambassador Page at London and to Ambassador  Gerard at Berlin suggesting that a modus vivendi be entered into by  England and Germany by which submarine warfare and sowing of mines at  sea might be abandoned if foodstuffs were allowed to reach the German  civil population under American consular inspection.    Germany replied to this on March 1, expressing her willingness to act  favorably on the proposal. The same day the British Government stated  that because of the war-zone decree of the German Government the  British Government must take measures to prevent commodities of all  kinds from reaching or leaving Germany. On March 15 the British  Government flatly refused the modus vivendi suggestion.    On April 4 Count von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador at Washington,  submitted a memorandum to the United States Government regarding  German-American trade and the exportation of arms. Mr. Bryan replied  to the memorandum on April 21, insisting that the United States was  preserving her strict status of neutrality according to the accepted  laws of nations.    On May 7 the Cunard steamship Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine  in the war zone as decreed by Germany, and more than 100 American  citizens perished, with 1,000 other persons on board.    Thereupon, on May 13, the United States transmitted to the German  Government a note on the subject of this loss. It said:         \"American citizens act within their indisputable rights in       taking their ships and in traveling wherever their       legitimate business calls them upon the high seas, and       exercise those rights in what should be the well justified       confidence that their lives will not be endangered by acts       done in clear violation of universally acknowledged       international obligations, and certainly in the confidence       that their own Government will sustain them in the exercise       of their rights.\"    This note concluded:         \"The Imperial Government will not expect the Government of       the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to       the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights       of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding       their free exercise and enjoyment.\"    Germany replied to this note on May 29. It stated that it had heard  that the Lusitania was an armed naval ship which had attempted to use  American passengers as a protection, and that, anyway, such passengers  should not have been present. It added:         \"The German commanders are consequently no longer in a       position to observe the rules of capture otherwise usual and       with which they invariably complied before this.\"    To the foregoing the United States maintained in a note sent to the  German Government on June 9 that the Lusitania was not an armed vessel  and that she had sailed in accordance with the laws of the United  States, and that \"only her actual resistance to capture or refusal to  stop when ordered to do so ... could have afforded the commander of  the submarine any justification for so much as putting the lives of  those on board the ship in jeopardy.\"    In support of this view the note cited international law and added:         \"It is upon this principle of humanity, as well as upon the       law founded upon this principle, that the United States must       stand.\"    Exactly one month later, on July 9, came Germany's reply. Its preamble  praised the United States for its humane attitude and said that  Germany was fully in accord therewith. Something, it asserted, should  be done, for \"the case of the Lusitania shows with horrible clearness  to what jeopardizing of human lives the manner of conducting war  employed by our adversaries leads,\" and that under certain conditions  which it set forth, American ships might have safe passage through the  war zone, or even some enemy ships flying the American flag. It  continued:         \"The Imperial Government, however, confidently hopes the       American Government will assume to guarantee that these       vessels have no contraband on board, details of arrangements       for the unhampered passage of these vessels to be agreed       upon by the naval authorities of both sides.\"    It is to this reply that the note of the United States Government made  public on July 24 is an answer.    Germany's reply of July 8 and President Wilson's final rejoinder of  July 21--which was given to the American press of July 24--are  presented below, together with accounts of the recent German  submarine attacks on the ships Armenian, Anglo-Californian, Normandy,  and Orduna, involving American lives, and an appraisal of the German  operations in the submarine \"war zone\" since February 18, 1915, when  it was proclaimed.
