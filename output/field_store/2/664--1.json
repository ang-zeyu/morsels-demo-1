Besides that vast  accumulation, I have been favoured with several thousands of other  pieces from the legion of Mr. Gladstone's correspondents. Between two  and three hundred thousand written papers of one sort or another must  have passed under my view. To some important journals and papers from  other sources I have enjoyed free access, and my warm thanks are due to  those who have generously lent me this valuable aid. I am especially  indebted to the King for the liberality with which his Majesty has been  graciously pleased to sanction the use of certain documents, in cases  where the permission of the Sovereign was required.    When I submitted an application for the same purpose to Queen Victoria,  in readily promising her favourable consideration, the Queen added a  message strongly impressing on me that the work I was about to undertake  should not be handled in the narrow way of party. This injunction  represents my own clear view of the spirit in which the history of a  career so memorable as Mr. Gladstone's should be composed. That, to be  sure, is not at all inconsistent with our regarding party feeling in its  honourable sense, as entirely the reverse of an infirmity.    The diaries from which I have often quoted consist of forty little books  in double columns, intended to do little more than record persons seen,  or books read, or letters written as the days passed by. From these  diaries come several of the mottoes prefixed to our chapters; such  mottoes are marked by an asterisk.    The trustees and other members of Mr. Gladstone's family have extended  to me a uniform kindness and consideration and an absolutely unstinted  confidence, for which I can never cease to owe them my heartiest  acknowledgment. They left with the writer an unqualified and undivided  responsibility for these pages, and for the use of the material that  they entrusted to him. Whatever may prove to be amiss, whether in  leaving out or putting in or putting wrong, the blame is wholly mine.                                                           J.

To try to write his life  to-day, is to push temerity still further. The ashes of controversy, in  which he was much concerned, are still hot; perspective, scale,  relation, must all while we stand so near be difficult to adjust. Not  all particulars, more especially of the latest marches in his wide  campaign, can be disclosed without risk of unjust pain to persons now  alive. Yet to defer the task for thirty or forty years has plain  drawbacks too. Interest grows less vivid; truth becomes harder to find  out; memories pale and colour fades. And if in one sense a statesman's  contemporaries, even after death has abated the storm and temper of  faction, can scarcely judge him, yet in another sense they who breathe  the same air as he breathed, who know at close quarters the problems  that faced him, the materials with which he had to work, the limitations  of his time--such must be the best, if not the only true memorialists  and recorders.    Every reader will perceive that perhaps the sharpest of all the many  difficulties of my task has been to draw the line between history and  biography--between the fortunes of the community and the exploits,  thoughts, and purposes of the individual who had so marked a share in  them. In the case of men of letters, in whose lives our literature is  admirably rich, this difficulty happily for their authors and for our  delight does not arise. But where the subject is a man who was four  times at the head of the government--no phantom, but dictator--and who  held this office of first minister for a longer time than any other  statesman in the reign of the Queen, how can we tell the story of his  works and days without reference, and ample reference, to the course of  events over whose unrolling he presided, and out of which he made  history? It is true that what interests the world in Mr. Gladstone is  even more what he was, than what he did; his brilliancy, charm, and  power; the endless surprises; his dualism or more than dualism; his  vicissitudes of opinion; his subtleties of mental progress; his strange  union of qualities never elsewhere found together; his striking  unlikeness to"]]]
