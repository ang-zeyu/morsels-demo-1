In no case do the powers attributed to  him exceed those which are claimed for a fully equipped Adept.    S.

The moon had just  arisen, and it softened the beauty of the old college buildings,  mellowed the harshness of time, casting shadow pools beneath the  cloisteresque arches to the west and setting out the ivy in stronger  relief upon the ancient walls. The barred shadow on the lichened  stones beyond the elm was cast by the hidden gate; and straight ahead,  where, between a quaint chimney-stack and a bartizan, a triangular  patch of blue showed like spangled velvet, lay the Thames. It was from  there the cooling breeze came.    But Cairn's gaze was set upon a window almost directly ahead, and west  below the chimneys. Within the room to which it belonged a lambent  light played.    Cairn turned to his companion, a ruddy and athletic looking man,  somewhat bovine in type, who at the moment was busily tracing out  sections on a human skull and checking his calculations from Ross's  _Diseases of the Nervous System_.    \"Sime,\" he said, \"what does Ferrara always have a fire in his rooms  for at this time of the year?\"    Sime glanced up irritably at the speaker. Cairn was a tall, thin  Scotsman, clean-shaven, square jawed, and with the crisp light hair  and grey eyes which often bespeak unusual virility.    \"Aren't you going to do any work?\" he inquired pathetically. \"I  thought you'd come to give me a hand with my _basal ganglia_. I shall  go down on that; and there you've been stuck staring out of the  window!\"    \"Wilson, in the end house, has got a most unusual brain,\" said Cairn,  with apparent irrelevance.    \"Has he!\" snapped Sime.    \"Yes, in a bottle. His governor is at Bart's; he sent it up yesterday.  You ought to see it.\"    \"Nobody will ever want to put _your_ brain in a bottle,\" predicted the  scowling Sime, and resumed his studies.    Cairn relighted his pipe, staring across the quadrangle again. Then--    \"You've never been in Ferrara's rooms, have you?\" he inquired.    Followed a muffled curse, crash, and the skull went rolling across the  floor.    \"Look here, Cairn,\" cried Sime, \"I've only got a week or so now, and  my nervous system is frantically rocky; I shall go all to pieces on my  nervous system. If you want to talk, go ahead. When you're finished, I  can begin work.\"    \"Right-oh,\" said Cairn calmly, and tossed his pouch across. \"I want to  talk to you about Ferrara.\"    \"Go ahead then. What is the matter with Ferrara?\"    \"Well,\" replied Cairn, \"he's queer.\"    \"That's no news,\" said Sime, filling his pipe; \"we all know he's a  queer chap. But he's popular with women. He'd make a fortune as a  nerve specialist.\"    \"He doesn't have to; he inherits a fortune when Sir Michael dies.\"    \"There's a pretty cousin, too, isn't there?\" inquired Sime slyly.    \"There is,\" replied Cairn. \"Of course,\" he continued, \"my governor and  Sir Michael are bosom friends, and although I've never seen much of  young Ferrara, at the same time I've got nothing against him. But--\"  he hesitated.    \"Spit it out,\" urged Sime, watching him oddly.    \"Well, it's silly, I suppose, but what does he want with a fire on a  blazing night like this?\"    Sime stared.    \"Perhaps he's a throw-back,\" he suggested lightly. \"The Ferraras,  although they're counted Scotch--aren't they?--must have been Italian  originally--\"    \"Spanish,\" corrected Cairn. \"They date from the son of Andrea Ferrara,  the sword-maker, who was a Spaniard. Caesar Ferrara came with the  Armada in 1588 as armourer. His ship was wrecked up in the Bay of  Tobermory and he got ashore--and stopped.\"    \"Married a Scotch lassie?\"    \"Exactly. But the genealogy of the family doesn't account for Antony's  habits.\"    \"What habits?\"    \"Well, look.\" Cairn waved in the direction of the open window. \"What  does he do in the dark all night, with a fire going?\"    \"Influenza?\"    \"Nonsense! You've never been in his rooms, have you?\"    \"No. Very few men have. But as I said before, he's popular with the  women.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean there have been complaints. Any other man would have been sent  down.\"    \"You think he has influence--\"    \"Influence of some sort, undoubtedly.\"    \"Well, I can see you have serious doubts about the man, as I have  myself, so I can unburden my mind. You recall that sudden thunderstorm  on Thursday?\"    \"Rather; quite upset me for work.\"    \"I was out in it. I was lying in a punt in the backwater--you know,  _our_ backwater.\"    \"Lazy dog.\"    \"To tell you the truth, I was trying to make up my mind whether I  should abandon bones and take the post on the _Planet_ which has been  offered me.\"    \"Pills for the pen--Harley for Fleet? Did you decide?\"    \"Not then; something happened which quite changed my line of  reflection.\"    The room was becoming cloudy with tobacco smoke.    \"It was delightfully still,\" Cairn resumed. \"A water rat rose within  a foot of me and a kingfisher was busy on a twig almost at my elbow.  Twilight was just creeping along, and I could hear nothing but faint  creakings of sculls from the river and sometimes the drip of a  punt-pole. I thought the river seemed to become suddenly deserted; it  grew quite abnormally quiet--and abnormally dark. But I was so deep in  reflection that it never occurred to me to move.    \"Then the flotilla of swans came round the bend, with Apollo--you know  Apollo, the king-swan?--at their head. By this time it had grown  tremendously dark, but it never occurred to me to ask myself why. The  swans, gliding along so noiselessly, might have been phantoms. A hush,  a perfect hush, settled down. Sime, that hush was the prelude to a  strange thing--an unholy thing!\"    Cairn rose excitedly and strode across to the table, kicking the skull  out of his way.    \"It was the storm gathering,\" snapped Sime.    \"It was something else gathering! Listen! It got yet darker, but for  some inexplicable reason, although I must have heard the thunder  muttering, I couldn't take my eyes off the swans. Then it  happened--the thing I came here to tell you about; I must tell  somebody--the thing that I am not going to forget in a hurry.\"    He began to knock out the ash from his pipe.    \"Go on,\" directed Sime tersely.    \"The big swan--Apollo--was within ten feet of me; he swam in open  water, clear of the others; no living thing touched him. Suddenly,  uttering a cry that chilled my very blood, a cry that I never heard  from a swan in my life, he rose in the air, his huge wings  extended--like a tortured phantom, Sime; I can never forget it--six  feet clear of the water. The uncanny wail became a stifled hiss, and  sending up a perfect fountain of water--I was deluged--the poor old  king-swan fell, beat the surface with his wings--and was still.\"    \"Well?\"    \"The other swans glided off like ghosts. Several heavy raindrops  pattered on the leaves above. I admit I was scared. Apollo lay with  one wing right in the punt. I was standing up; I had jumped to my feet  when the thing occurred. I stooped and touched the wing. The bird was  quite dead! Sime, I pulled the swan's head out of the water, and--his  neck was broken; no fewer than three vertebrae fractured!\"    A cloud of tobacco smoke was wafted towards the open window.    \"It isn't one in a million who could wring the neck of a bird like  Apollo, Sime; but it was done before my eyes without the visible  agency of God or man! As I dropped him and took to the pole, the storm  burst. A clap of thunder spoke with the voice of a thousand cannon,  and I poled for bare life from that haunted backwater. I was drenched  to the skin when I got in, and I ran up all the way from the stage.\"    \"Well?\" rapped the other again, as Cairn paused to refill his pipe.    \"It was seeing the firelight flickering at Ferrara's window that led  me to do it. I don't often call on him; but I thought that a rub down  before the fire and a glass of toddy would put me right. The storm had  abated as I got to the foot of his stair--only a distant rolling of  thunder.    \"Then, out of the shadows--it was quite dark--into "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#1)"],[1,"=THE LAUGHING  PRINCE=    A book of Jugoslav Fairy Tales  and Folk Tales.    RETOLD BY  PARKER FILLMORE    With illustrations and decorations by Jay Van Everen.      When Mr. Fillmore started his study of the folk lore of Eastern Europe,  he tapped a mine of treasure for children. The gorgeousness of the  imagery in the stories, their rollicking humor, the adventures, were  entirely new to child and adult readers. The stories in this third  volume reflect the folk lore of many races, for the country now known as  Jugoslavia has been one of the great highways and battlefields of the  world where Orient and Occident, Greek and Roman, Turk and Slav have  fought out their national aspirations. Basically, it has the Slavic  exuberance of imagination and humor, but it has also absorbed much of  the spirit and tales of the Near and Far East.    _Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc._  757 THIRD AVENUE, NEW YORK 17, N.

COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY    PARKER FILLMORE    RENEWED BY LOUISE FILLMORE    0.1.68      PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA          TO BUTTON    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          NOTE      In calling this _A Book of Jugoslav Fairy Tales and Folk Tales_ I have  used the word Jugoslav in its literal sense of Southern Slav. The  Bulgars are just as truly Southern Slavs as the Serbs or Croats or any  other of the Slav peoples now included within the state of Jugoslavia.  Moreover in this case it would be particularly difficult to make the  literary boundaries conform strictly to the political boundaries since  much the same stories and folk tales are current among all these Slav  peoples of the Balkan Peninsula. The special student taking the variants  of the same story might discover special differences that would mark  each variant as the product of some one locality. The work of such a  student would have philological and ethnological value but not a very  strong appeal to the general reader. My appeal is first of all to the  general reader--to the child who loves fairy tales and to the adult who  loves them. I hope they will both find these stories entertaining and  amusing quite aside from any interest in their source.    Yet these tales as presented do give the reader a true idea of the  amazing vigor and the artistic inventiveness of the Jugoslav  imagination, and also of the various influences, Oriental and Northern  as well as Slavic, which have made that imagination what it is to-day.  Here are gay picaresque tales of adventure--how they go on and on and  on!--charming little stories of sentiment, a few folk tales of stark  simplicity and grim humor, one story showing a superficial Turkish  influence, and one spiritual allegory as deep and moving as anything in  the Russian.    The renderings in every case are my own and are not in any sense  translations. I have taken the old stories and retold them in a new  language. To do them justice in this new language I have found it  necessary to present them with a new selection of detail and with an  occasional shifting of emphasis. I do not mean by this that I have  invented detail in any unwarranted fashion. I haven't had to for any  folk tale, however bald, contains all sorts of things by implication.  The true story teller, it seems to me, is he who is able to grasp these  implications and turn them to his own use.    I must confess that the setting in which I have placed the famous old  Serbian nonsense story, _In my young days when I was an old, old man_,  is my own invention. The nonsense story needs a setting and as it  chanced I had one ready as I have long wanted to tell the world what was  back of the determination of that princess who refused to eat until some  one had made her laugh.    So far as I know most of these stories are not familiar to English  readers--certainly not in this form. Madame Mijatovich uses one of them  in her _Serbian Fairy Tales_, but I make no apology for offering a  sprightlier version. Nor do I apologize for presenting any stories that  may have been included somewhere among the indifferent translations to  which Andrew Lang lent his name.    I am of course deeply indebted to the various people who told me these  stories in the first place and to many scholarly folklorists, Jugoslav,  Czechoslovak, Bulgarian, German, and English whose books and reports I  have studied.

The  eldest son was a studious boy who learned so much out of books that the  farmer said:    \"We must send Mihailo to school and make a priest of him.\"    The second boy was a trader. Whatever you had he would get it from you  by offering you something else for it. And always what he gave you was  worth less than what you gave him.    \"Jakov will make a fine peddler,\" the farmer said. \"He's industrious and  sharp and some day he will probably be a rich man.\"    But Stefan, the farmer's youngest son, had no special talent and because  he didn't spend all his time with his nose in a book and because he  never made the best of a bargain his brothers scorned him. Militza, his  little sister, loved him dearly for he was kind and jolly and in the  evening he was always ready to tell her stories and play with her. But  the farmer, of course, listened to the older brothers.    \"I don't know about poor Stefan,\" he used to say. \"He's a good boy but  he talks nonsense. I suppose he'll have to stay on the farm and work.\"    Now the truth is the farm was a fine place for Stefan for he was strong  and lusty and he liked to plow and harvest and he had a wonderful way  with the animals. He talked to them as if they were human beings and the  horses all whinnied when he came near, and the cows rubbed their soft  noses against his shoulder, and as for the pigs--they loved him so much  that whenever they saw him they used to run squealing between his legs.    \"Stefan is nothing but a farmer!\" Mihailo used to say as though being a  farmer was something to be ashamed of.    And Jakov said:    \"If the village people could see the pigs following him about, how  they'd laugh at him! I hope when I go to the village to live he won't be  visiting me all the time!\"    Another thing the older brothers couldn't understand about Stefan was  why he was always laughing and joking. He did the work of two men but  whether he was working or resting you could always hear him cracking his  merry jokes and laughing his jolly laugh.    \"I think he's foolish!\" Mihailo said.    Jakov hoped that the village people wouldn't hear about his carryings  on.    \"They'd laugh at him,\" he said, \"and they'd laugh at us, too, because  we're his brothers.\"    But Stefan didn't care. The more they frowned at him, the louder he  laughed, and in spite of their dark looks he kept on cracking his merry  jokes and talking nonsense. And every evening after supper his little  sister, Militza, clapped her hands and cried:    \"Now, Stefan, tell me a story! Tell me a story!\"    \"Father,\" Mihailo would say, \"you ought to make him keep quiet! He's  foolish and all he does is fill Militza's head with nonsense!\"    This always made Militza very indignant and she would stamp her little  foot and say:    \"He isn't foolish! He knows more than any one! And he can do more things  than any one else and he's the handsomest brother in the world!\"    You see Militza loved Stefan dearly and when you love a person of course  you think that person is wonderful. But the father supposed that Mihailo  must be right for Mihailo studied in books. So he shook his head and  sighed every time he thought of Stefan.    Now the kingdom in which the three brothers lived was ruled over"]]]
