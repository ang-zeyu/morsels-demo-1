PREFACE      The contents of the present volume are of much the same character as  those of its predecessor, 'Roman Britain in 1913'. The first section  gives a retrospect of the chief finds made in 1914, so far as they are  known to me. The second section is a more detailed and technical survey  of the inscriptions found in Britain during that year. The third and  longest section is a summary, with some attempt at estimate and  criticism, of books and articles dealing with Roman Britain which  appeared in 1914 or at least bear that date on cover or title-page.  At the end I have added, for convenience, a list of the English  archaeological and other publications which at least sometimes contain  noteworthy articles relating to Roman Britain.    The total, both of finds and of publications, is smaller than in 1913.  In part the outbreak of war in August called off various supervisors  and not a few workmen from excavations then in progress; in one case  it prevented a proposed excavation from being begun. It also seems to  have retarded the issue of some archaeological periodicals. But the  scarcity of finds is much more due to natural causes. The most extensive  excavations of the year, those of Wroxeter and Corbridge, yielded  little; they were both concerned with remains which had to be explored  in the course of a complete uncovering of those sites but which were not  in themselves very interesting. The lesser sites, too, were somewhat  unproductive, though at least one, Traprain Law, is full of promise for  the future, and good work has been done in the systematic examination  of the fort at Ambleside and of certain rubbish-pits in London. In one  case, that of Holt (pp. 15-21), where excavations have for the present  come to an end, I have thought it well to include a brief retrospect  of the whole of a very interesting series of finds and, aided by the  kindness of the excavator, Mr. Arthur Acton of Wrexham, to add some  illustrations of notable objects which have not yet appeared elsewhere  in print.          A. RETROSPECT OF FINDS MADE IN 1914    i-xiv. FINDS RELATING TO THE ROMAN MILITARY OCCUPATION.      (i) The exploration of the Roman-seeming earthworks in northern Scotland  which Dr. Macdonald and I began in 1913 at Ythan Wells, in Aberdeenshire  (Report for 1913, p. 7), was continued in 1914 by Dr. Macdonald at  Raedykes, otherwise called Garrison Hill, three miles inland from  Stonehaven. Here Roy saw and planned a large camp of very irregular  outline, which he took to be Roman.[1] Since his time the ramparts have  been somewhat ploughed down, but Dr. Macdonald could trace them round,  identify the six gateways, and generally confirm Roy's plan, apart from  its hill-shading. The ramparts proved to be of two kinds: part was built  solidly of earth, with a deep ditch of Roman shape strengthened in  places with clay, in front of it, while part was roughly piled with  stones and defended only by a shallow rounded ditch. This difference  seemed due to the differing nature of the ground; ditch and rampart were  slighter where attack was less easy. The gateways were wide and provided  with traverses (_tituli_ or _tutuli_), as at Ythan Wells. No small finds  were secured. The general character of the gateways and ramparts seemed  to show Roman workmanship, but the exact date within the Roman period  remained doubtful. It has been suggested that the traverses indicate  Flavian rather than Antonine fortifying. But these devices are met with  in Britain at Bar Hill, which presumably dates from about A.D. 140, and  on Hadrian's Wall in third-century work.    [Footnote 1: _Antiquities_, plate 50. Roy does not notice it in his  text, any more than he notices plate 51 (Ythan Wells camp). They are the  two last plates in his volume; as this was issued posthumously in 1793  (he died in 1790), perhaps the omission is intelligible.]    (ii) _Wall of Pius and its forts._ At Balmuildy, north of Glasgow  (see Report for 1913, p. 10), Mr. Miller has further cleared the baths  outside the south-east corner of the fort and the adjacent ditches.  The plan which I gave last year has now to be corrected so as to show  a triple ditch between the south gate and the south-east corner and a  double ditch from the south-east corner to the east gate. This latter  section of ditch was, however, filled up at some time with clay, and the  bath planted on top of it. At presumably the same time a ditch was run  out from the south-east corner so as to enclose the bath and form an  annexe; in this annexe was found a broken altar-top with a few letters  on it (below, p. 29). Search was also made for rubbish-pits on the north  side of the fort, but without any result.

Many singers try their whole lives long to produce them and never  succeed. This happens because science understands too little of  singing, the singer too little of science. I mean that the  physiological explanations of the highly complicated processes of  singing are not plainly enough put for the singer, who has to concern  himself chiefly with his sensations in singing and guide himself by  them. Scientific men are not at all agreed as to the exact functions  of the several organs; the humblest singer knows something about them.  Every serious artist has a sincere desire to help others reach the  goal--the goal toward which all singers are striving: to sing well and  beautifully.    The true art of song has always been possessed and will always be  possessed by such individuals as are dowered by nature with all that  is needful for it--that is, healthy vocal organs, uninjured by vicious  habits of speech; a good ear, a talent for singing, intelligence,  industry, and energy.    In former times eight years were devoted to the study of singing--at  the Prague Conservatory, for instance. Most of the mistakes and  misunderstandings of the pupil could be discovered before he secured  an engagement, and the teacher could spend so much time in correcting  them that the pupil learned to pass judgment on himself properly.    But art to-day must be pursued like everything else, by steam. Artists  are turned out in factories, that is, in so-called conservatories, or  by teachers who give lessons ten or twelve hours a day. In two years  they receive a certificate of competence, or at least the diploma of  the factory. The latter, especially, I consider a crime, that the  state should prohibit.    All the inflexibility and unskilfulness, mistakes and deficiencies,  which were formerly disclosed during a long course of study, do not  appear now, under the factory system, until the student's public  career has begun. There can be no question of correcting them, for  there is no time, no teacher, no critic; and the executant has learned  nothing, absolutely nothing, whereby he could undertake to distinguish  or correct them.    The incompetence and lack of talent whitewashed over by the factory  concern lose only too soon their plausible brilliancy. A failure in  life is generally the sad end of such a factory product; and to  factory methods the whole art of song is more and more given over as a  sacrifice.    I cannot stand by and see these things with indifference. My artistic  conscience urges me to disclose all that I have learned and that has  become clear to me in the course of my career, for the benefit of art;  and to give up my \"secrets,\" which seem to be secrets only because  students so rarely pursue the path of proper study to its end. If  artists, often such only in name, come to a realization of their  deficiencies, they lack only too frequently the courage to acknowledge  them to others. Not until we artists all reach the point when we can  take counsel with each other about our mistakes and deficiencies, and  discuss the means for overcoming them, putting our pride in our  pockets, will bad singing and inartistic effort be checked, and our  noble art of singing come into its rights again.      MY TITLE TO WRITE ON THE ART OF SONG    Rarely are so many desirable and necessary antecedents united as in my  case.    The child of two singers, my mother being gifted musically quite out  of the common, and active for many years not only as a dramatic  singer, but also as a harp virtuoso, I, with my sister Marie, received  a very careful musical education; and later a notable course of  instruction in singing from her. From my fifth year on I listened  daily to singing lessons; from my ninth year I played accompaniments  on the pianoforte, sang all the missing parts, in French, Italian,  German, and Bohemian; got thoroughly familiar with all the operas, and  very soon knew how to tell good singing from bad.
