At last his dream had come  true; he was in the heart of the Maine woods! It was a wonderful  experience for a boy of his age to be his father's companion on a  fishing trip. Each spring when Dr. Swift had packed his tackle for his  annual vacation into the wilderness, and Theo had looked on with  hungry eyes as the rods, flies, and tramping boots had been stowed  away in the canvas grips, his father had said:    \"Wait until you are a bit older, son, and you shall go with me.\"    And now that day had come, and here he was! It seemed too good to be  true.    He glanced up to find his father smiling down at him.    \"Well?\" questioned the older man. \"What do you think of the camp? Does  it come up to your expectations?\"    \"I should say it did!\" Theo managed to gasp. \"It is great, Father!\"    \"Think you can be contented here for a month?\"    \"Contented!\" laughed Theo.    \"You won't be getting lonesome and wishing you were back in New York?\"    \"Not much.\"    \"Well, I hope you'll have a good time. Certainly with plenty of  fishing and tramping you should. You will find Manuel, our Indian  guide, a never-ending source of entertainment; he can do everything  from dressing a moose to building a canoe. There isn't a trail through  these woods that he couldn't travel blindfolded. You will be perfectly  safe with him; only you must do exactly as he says, no matter how  silly his orders may seem. He knows the woods better than you do--or  than I do, for that matter. Remember you are no longer on Fifth  Avenue, where you can call a policeman or a taxicab if you get  lost. This vast forest is an entirely different proposition.\"    Theo nodded.    \"How still it is,\" he said softly.    \"Yes,\" rejoined his father; \"that is why it means to me something that  no other place can. After the rush of the city, the jangle of  telephones, the constant sight of sick people, there is nothing to  compare with the restfulness of these woods.\"    The Doctor, who had been standing with his back to the fire, his hands  clasped behind him, drew out his pipe, lighted it, and puffed a ring  of smoke into the air.    \"You have had a very busy year, Father.\"    \"Yes, and I fancy there will be a still busier one ahead. Before I  attack it I feel that it is my duty to get a good rest. In these war  days a doctor never knows where he may be needed to serve. Thus far my  place seems to have been at a home hospital. With eight of our  operating staff in France it has meant much extra work, too. Not that  I am complaining of that. I am only too glad to do my bit wherever it  is. But I had got to the point where I felt that the man who can give  the best service is the man who does not allow himself to become too  fagged. So I determined to take my usual vacation even though on the  face of it it seemed a crime to devote myself to nothing but fishing  for a whole month.\"    Theo glanced into the face of the big, earnest man before him; he felt  suddenly very grown up. His father had seldom talked to him like  this.    \"This war,\" went on Dr. Swift thoughtfully, \"is going to make demands  on all of us--demands for money, work, and time. We should be proud to  give these, for it is the first time our country has ever asked  anything of our generation. We have taken unthinkingly all the  benefits America has to offer--libraries; schools; well ordered cities  to live in; the blessings of constant peace and prosperity. For it we  have returned to the government only the slight taxes demanded for the  up-keep of these things; and most of us, I blush to say, have grumbled  a great deal about it, at that. As a nation we were becoming too  comfortable, too rich, too selfish, too complacent. Now a crisis has  arisen when the United States is asking more of us, as it has every  right to do; and we should be eager to prove our gratitude for all we  have so freely received. Only those who have traveled much can fully  realize what a home and an education in a place like America mean.  Never forget, son, that all we can do, even to the sacrifice of our  lives, is none too high a price to pay for our beloved country.\"    \"I wish I might have gone to France, Father,\" said Theo earnestly.    \"A boy of fifteen is too young to go,\" returned Dr. Swift. \"If you  were older I should be the first to bid you Godspeed, for it is a  great opportunity for service. Those who are not sharing it are  missing one of life's richest experiences. It means danger, privation,  perhaps death; but it means also the exercise of all that is finest in  our natures--patriotism, heroism, the dedication of ourselves to a  great cause. I should have been proud to have you in France,  Theo. However, there is much a boy can do here and now. He can begin  being a loyal unselfish citizen, and training himself to bear his part  when he shall be older. Get your education first. Prepare yourself to  be of value to humanity so that when your time to help comes it may  find you useful and ready.\"    There was a moment of silence.    The great logs in the rough stone chimney crackled and snapped, and up  the flue roared the blaze. Outside all was still save when the breeze  stirred the giant pines causing them to give out a mighty whisper like  the murmur of the sea.    It was a cozy interior over which the firelight flashed.    The log cabin had been sheathed to keep it warm and tight, and to  conceal its barrenness on the walls had been tacked a few gaily  colored prints. On one side of the room were several well-filled  bookshelves, while on the opposite wall were racks for pipes and  guns. From over the fireplace an elk's head peered forth, catching the  scarlet glow from the fire on its mammoth antlers. Two small bedrooms  which led out of this living-room completed the cabin. Outside stood  four others built exactly like this one, and in addition a  dining-cabin, cook-house, and two cabins for the guides.    Aside from this tiny settlement on the lake's edge there was not a  house for twenty miles. It was a wilderness indeed!    \"Are there any other people staying here at the camp beside  ourselves?\" inquired Theo at last.    Dr. Swift, who had seated himself before the fire, nodded.    \"Yes, there is a Mr. Croyden, from Trenton, New Jersey, whom I have  met here before--a splendid man, whom you will like. He is a great  fisherman--comes back every season just about this time. At present  there is no one else, so you will not find the woods overcrowded.\"    Theo laughed at the bare suggestion, then yawned drowsily.    \"Nor will you be troubled by not sleeping to-night, eh, son? You look  about ready to hit the pillow this minute.\"    \"I am,\" replied Theo. \"I never was so sleepy in my life.\"    \"That is the Maine air.\"    \"Some of it is the effect of the corduroy road,\" the boy observed with  a grin.    \"It is a beastly road, that carry,\" agreed Dr. Swift. \"It shakes  every bone in your body. When you do manage to get here, however, it  certainly is worth the trip. Do you feel as if you could worry down a  little dinner?\"    \"Well, rather!\"    The Doctor chuckled.    \"So do I. It ought to be ready soon now, for it is nearly six.\"    Just at this moment the sound of a horn was heard.    Dr. Swift rose promptly.    \"That is dinner,\" he said.    \"I expected "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19424"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Exeter (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION      In reissuing this handbook, which during the lapse of twenty-three years  had become out of date in many ways, the editor has introduced  considerable alterations in the arrangement of the matter, with a view  to facilitating its use as a guide to the various parts of the  Cathedral. For suggestions as to this, and for numerous improvements and  corrections in detail he is particularly indebted to Miss Beatrix F.  Cresswell, whose published works \"Exeter Churches,\" \"Notes on the  Churches of the Deanery of Ken,\" and \"Edwardian Inventories for the City  and County of Exeter\" have made her an authority on the ecclesiology of  the Diocese.

HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF ST. MARY AND ST. PETER IN EXETER.      The history of any ancient cathedral must always be interesting, and  that of Exeter is no exception, though \"it supplies less of  architectural history than those churches whose whole character has been  altered over and over again.\" A cathedral represents not only the  spiritual, but the active, laborious, and artistic life of past  generations. The bishop, too, was in many ways the head man of the  province, and combined, not seldom, the varied qualities of priest,  warrior, and statesman. The acts of such ecclesiastics were full of  importance, not for their own city only, but often also for the whole  nation. As men who had frequently travelled much and studied deeply,  they summoned to their aid in the building and beautifying of their  churches the most skilled artists end artificers of their time; so, with  the story of the lives of the bishops of a diocese, the history of a  cathedral's building is inextricably woven. To be elevated to a  bishopric generally meant to be put into possession of great  wealth--when Veysey became bishop the revenues of the see of Exeter  have, by some authors, been computed at L100,000; Canon Hingeston-Randolph  puts them, with more reason and authority, at the sum of L30,000--and a  large portion of this money was spent on works connected with the chief  church of the diocese.
