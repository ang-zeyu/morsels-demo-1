The little girl came into her papa's study, as she always did Saturday  morning before breakfast, and asked for a story. He tried to beg off  that morning, for he was very busy, but she would not let him. So he  began:    \"Well, once there was a little pig--\"    She put her hand over his mouth and stopped him at the word. She said  she had heard little pig-stories till she was perfectly sick of them.    \"Well, what kind of story _shall_ I tell, then?\"    \"About Christmas. It's getting to be the season. It's past Thanksgiving  already.\"    \"It seems to me,\" her papa argued, \"that I've told as often about  Christmas as I have about little pigs.\"    \"No difference! Christmas is more interesting.\"    \"Well!\" Her papa roused himself from his writing by a great effort.  \"Well, then, I'll tell you about the little girl that wanted it  Christmas every day in the year. How would you like that?\"    \"First-rate!\" said the little girl; and she nestled into comfortable  shape in his lap, ready for listening.    \"Very well, then, this little pig--Oh, what are you pounding me for?\"    \"Because you said little pig instead of little girl.\"    \"I should like to know what's the difference between a little pig and a  little girl that wanted it Christmas every day!\"    \"Papa,\" said the little girl, warningly, \"if you don't go on, I'll  _give_ it to you!\" And at this her papa darted off like lightning, and  began to tell the story as fast as he could.      Well, once there was a little girl who liked Christmas so much that    she wanted it to be Christmas every day in the year; and as soon as    Thanksgiving was over she began to send postal-cards to the old    Christmas Fairy to ask if she mightn't have it. But the old fairy    never answered any of the postals; and after a while the little girl    found out that the Fairy was pretty particular, and wouldn't notice    anything but letters--not even correspondence cards in envelopes; but    real letters on sheets of paper, and sealed outside with a    monogram--or your initial, anyway. So, then, she began to send her    letters; and in about three weeks--or just the day before Christmas,    it was--she got a letter from the Fairy, saying she might have it    Christmas every day for a year, and then they would see about having    it longer.      The little girl was a good deal excited already, preparing for the    old-fashioned, once-a-year Christmas that was coming the next day, and    perhaps the Fairy's promise didn't make such an impression on her as    it would have made at some other time. She just resolved to keep it to    herself, and surprise everybody with it as it kept coming true; and    then it slipped out of her mind altogether.      She had a splendid Christmas. She went to bed early, so as to let    Santa Claus have a chance at the stockings, and in the morning she was    up the first of anybody and went and felt them, and found hers all    lumpy with packages of candy, and oranges and grapes, and pocket-books    and rubber balls, and all kinds of small presents, and her big    brother's with nothing but the tongs in them, and her young lady    sister's with a new silk umbrella, and her papa's and mamma's with    potatoes and pieces of coal wrapped up in tissue-paper, just as they    always had every Christmas. Then she waited around till the rest of    the family were up, and she was the first to burst into the library,    when the doors were opened, and look at the large presents laid out on    the library-table--books, and portfolios, and boxes of stationery, and    breastpins, and dolls, and little stoves, and dozens of handkerchiefs,    and ink-stands, and skates, and snow-shovels, and photograph-frames,    and little easels, and boxes of water-colors, and Turkish paste, and    nougat, and candied cherries, and dolls' houses, and waterproofs--and    the big Christmas-tree, lighted and standing in a waste-basket in the    middle.      She had a splendid Christmas all day. She ate so much candy that she    did not want any breakfast; and the whole forenoon the presents kept    pouring in that the expressman had not had time to deliver the night    before; and she went round giving the presents she had got for other    people, and came home and ate turkey and cranberry for dinner, and    plum-pudding and nuts and raisins and oranges and more candy, and then    went out and coasted, and came in with a stomach-ache, crying; and her    papa said he would see if his house was turned into that sort of    fool's paradise another year; and they had a light supper, and pretty    early everybody went to bed cross.    Here the little girl pounded her papa in the back, again.    \"Well, what now? Did I say pigs?\"    \"You made them _act_ like pigs.\"    \"Well, didn't they?\"    \"No matter; you oughtn't to put it into a story.\"    \"Very well, then, I'll take it all out.\"    Her father went on:      The little girl slept very heavily, and she slept very late, but she    was wakened at last by the other children dancing round her bed with    their stockings full of presents in their hands.      \"What is it?\" said the little girl, and she rubbed her eyes and tried    to rise up in bed.      \"Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!\" they all shouted, and waved their    stockings.      \"Nonsense! It was Christmas yesterday.\"      Her brothers and sisters just laughed. \"We don't know about that. It's    Christmas to-day, anyway. You come into the library and see.\"      Then all at once it flashed on the little girl that the Fairy was    keeping her promise, and her year of Christmases was beginning. She    was dreadfully sleepy, but she sprang up like a lark--a lark that had    overeaten itself and gone to bed cross--and darted into the library.    There it was again! Books, and portfolios, and boxes of stationery,    and breastpins--    \"You needn't go over it all, papa; I guess I can remember just what was  there,\" said the little girl.      Well, and there was the Christmas-tree blazing away, and the family    picking out their presents, but looking pretty sleepy, and her father    perfectly puzzled, and her mother ready to cry. \"I'm sure I don't see    how I'm to dispose of all these things,\" said her mother, and her    father said it seemed to him they had had something just like it the    day before, but he supposed he must have dreamed it. This struck the    little girl as the best kind of a joke; and so she ate so much candy    she didn't want any breakfast, and went round carrying presents, and    had turkey and cranberry for dinner, and then went out and coasted,    and came in with a--    \"Papa!\"    \"Well, what now?\"    \"What did you promise, you forgetful thing?\"    \"Oh! oh yes!\"      Well, the next day, it was just the same thing over again, but    everybody getting crosser; and at the end of a week's time so many    people had lost their tempers that you could pick up lost tempers    anywhere; they perfectly strewed the ground. Even when people tried to    recover their tempers they usually got somebody else's, and it made    the most dreadful mix.      The little girl began to get frightened, keeping the secret all to    herself; she wanted to tell her mother, but she didn't dare to; and    she was ashamed to ask the Fairy to take back her gift, it seemed    ungrateful and ill-bred, and she thought she would try to stand it,    but she hardly knew how she could, for a whole year. So it went on and    on, and it was Christmas on St. Valentine's Day and Washington's    Birthday, just the same as any day, and it didn't skip even the First    of April, though everything was counterfeit that day, and that was    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#1)"],[1,"was produced from scans of public domain material  produced by Microsoft for their Live Search Books site.)

There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.  Barlow's Great American Circus in its triumphal progress from State to  State was close at hand, and immense yellow posters announcing its  arrival were liberally displayed on fences and barns, while smaller  bills were put up in the post office, the hotel, and the principal  stores, and distributed from house to house.    It was the largest circus that had ever visited Smyrna. At least a dozen  elephants marched with ponderous steps in its preliminary procession,  while clowns, acrobats, giants, dwarfs, fat women, cannibals, and hairy  savages from Thibet and Madagascar, were among the strange wonders which  were to be seen at each performance for the small sum of fifty cents,  children half price.    For weeks the young people had been looking forward to the advent of  this marvelous aggregation of curiosities, and the country papers from  farther east had given glowing accounts of the great show, which was  emphatically pronounced greater and more gorgeous than in any previous  year. But it may be as well to reproduce, in part, the description given  in the posters:         BARLOW'S GREAT NORTH AMERICAN CIRCUS.  Now in its triumphal march across the continent, will           give two grand performances,                     AT SMYRNA     On the afternoon and evening of May 18th.         Never in all its history has this  Unparalleled show embraced a greater variety of attractions,      or included a larger number of world famous  Acrobats, Clowns, Bare back Riders, Rope walkers, Trapeze             Artists, and Star Performers,     In addition to a colossal menagerie, comprising         Elephants, Tigers, Lions, Leopards,      and other wild animals in great variety.     All this and far more, including a hundred                    DARING ACTS,   Can be seen for the trifling sum of Fifty cents;                Children half price.              COME ONE!      COME ALL!    Two boys paused to read this notice, pasted with illustrative pictures  of elephants and circus performers on the high board fence near  Stoddard's grocery store. They were Dan Clark and Christopher Watson,  called Kit for short.    \"Shall you go to the circus, Dan?\" asked Kit.    \"I would like to, but you know, Kit, I have no money to spare.\"    \"Don't let that interfere,\" said Kit, kindly. \"Here is half a dollar.  That will take you in.\"    \"You're a tip-top fellow, Kit. But I don't think I ought to take it. I  don't know when I shall be able to return it.\"    \"Who asked you to return it? I meant it as a gift.\"    \"You're a true friend, Kit,\" said Dan, earnestly. \"I don't know as I  ought to take it, but I will anyhow. You know I only get my board and a  dollar a week from Farmer Clifford, and that I give to my mother.\"    \"I wish you had a better place, Dan.\"    \"So do I; but perhaps it is as well as I can do at my age. All boys are  not born to good luck as you are.\"    \"Am I born to good luck? I don't know.\"    \"Isn't your uncle Stephen the richest man in Smyrna?\"    \"I suppose he is; but that doesn't make me rich.\"    \"Isn't he your guardian?\"    \"Yes; but it doesn't follow because there is a guardian there is a  fortune.\"    \"I hope there is.\"    \"I am going to tell you something in confidence, Dan. Uncle Stephen has  lately been dropping a good many hints about the necessity of being  economical, and that I may have my own way to make in the world. What do  you think it means?\"    \"Have you been extravagant?\"    \"Not that I am aware of. I have been at an expensive boarding school  with my cousin Ralph, and I have dressed well, and had a fair amount of  spending money.\"    \"Have you spent any more than Ralph?\"    \"No; not so much, for I will tell you in confidence that he has been  playing pool and cards for money, of course without the knowledge of the  principal. I know also that this last term, besides spending his pocket  money he ran up bills, which his father had to pay, to the amount of  fifty dollars or more.\"    \"How did your uncle like it?\"    \"I don't know. Ralph and his father had a private interview, but he got  the money. I believe his mother took his part.\"    \"Why don't you ask your uncle just how you stand?\"    \"I have thought of it. If I am to inherit a fortune I should like to  know it. If I have my own way to make I want to know that also, so that  I can begin to prepare for it.\"    \"Would you feel bad if you found out that you were a poor boy--like me,  for instance?\"    \"I suppose I should just at first, but I should try to make the best of  it in the end.\"    \"Well, I hope you won't have occasion to buckle down to hard work. When  do you go back to school?\"    \"The next term begins next Monday.\"    \"And it is now Wednesday. You will be able to see the circus at any  rate. It is to arrive to-night.\"    \"Suppose we go round to the lot to-morrow morning. We can see them  putting up the tents.\"    \"All right! I'll meet you at nine o'clock.\"    They were about to separate when another boy, of about the same age and  size, came up.    \"It's time for dinner, Kit,\" he said; \"mother'll be angry if you are  late.\"    \"Very well! I'll go home with you. Good morning, Dan.\"    \"Good morning, Kit. Good morning, Ralph.\"    Ralph mumbled out \"Morning,\" but did not deign to look at Dan.    \"I wonder you associate with that boy, Kit,\" he said.    \"Why?\" inquired Kit, rather defiantly.    \"Because he's only a farm laborer.\"    \"Does that hurt him?\"    \"I don't care to associate with such a low class.\"    \"Daniel Webster worked on a farm when he was a boy.\"    \"Dan Clark isn't a Webster.\"    \"We don't know what he will turn out to be.\"    \"I don't consider him fit for me to associate with,\" said Ralph. \"It may  be different in your case.\"    \"Why should it be different in my case?\" asked Kit, suspiciously.    \"Oh, no offense at all, but your circumstances and social position are  likely to be different from mine.\"    \"Are they? That's just what I should like to find out.\"    \"My father says so, and as you are under his guardianship he ought to  know.\"    \"Yes, he ought to know, but he has never told me.\"    \"He has told me, but I am not at liberty to say anything,\" said Ralph,  looking mysterious.    \"I think I ought to be the first to be told,\" said Kit, not  unreasonably.    \"You will be told soon. There is one thing I can tell you, however. You  are not to go back to boarding school on Monday.\"    Kit paused in the street, and gazed at his companion in surprise.    \"Are you going back?\" he asked.    \"Yes; I'm going to keep on till I am ready for college.\"    \"And what is to be done with me?\"    Ralph shrugged his shoulders.    \"I am not at liberty to tell you,\" he answered.    \"I shall ask my uncle this very day.\"    \"Just as you please.\"    Kit walked on in silence. His mind was busy with thoughts of the change  in his prospects. He did not know what was coming, but he was anxious.  It was likely to be a turning point in his life, and he was apprehensive  that the information soon to be imparted to him would not be of an  agreeable nature.          CHAPTER II.    INTRODUCES THREE CURIOSITIES.      Stephen Watson, uncle of Kit and father of Ralph, was a man of middle  age. It was difficult to trace any resemblance between him and his  nephew. The latter had an open face, with a bright, attractive  expression. Mr. Watson was dark and sallow, of spare habit, and there  was a cunning look in his eyes, beneath which a Roman nose jutted out  like a promontory. He looked like the incarnation of cold selfishness,  and his real character did not belie his looks.    Five years before Kit Watson's father had died. He resembled Kit in  appearance, and was very popular in Smyrna. His brother wound up the  estate, and had since been living in luxury, but whether the property  was his or his nephew's Kit was unable to tell. He had asked the  question occasionally, but his uncle showed a distaste for the subject,  and gave evasive replies.    What Kit had just heard made him anxious, and he resolved to attack his  uncle once more. After dinner, therefore, he began:    \"Uncle Stephen, Ralph tells me I am not going back to school on  Monday.\"    \"Ralph speaks correctly,\" Mr. Watson replied in a measured voice.    \"But why am I not to go?\"    \"I will explain before the time comes.\"    \"Can you not tell me now? I am anxious to know.\"    \"You must curb your curiosity. You will know in good time.\"    Kit regarded his uncle in silence. He wished to know what had caused  this remarkable change, but it seemed useless to ask any more questions.    The next morning he and Dan Clark, according to agreement, met in front  of Stoddard's store.    \"I had hard work to get away,\" said Dan. \"Let us go right over to the  circus grounds.\"    These were located about a third of a mile from the hotel, in a large  twenty-acre pasture. The lot, as it was called, was a scene of activity.  A band of canvas men were busily engaged in putting up the big tent.  Several elephants were standing round, and the cages of animals had  already been put in place inside the rising tent.    On a bench outside sat a curious group, comprising Achilles Henderson,  the great Scotch giant, who was set down on the bills as eight feet  three inches in height, and was really about seven feet and a half;  Major Conrad, the dwarf, who was about the size of an average child of"]]]
