It was about four in the afternoon,  it was growing dark, and the immense hall of the Assembly having become  involved in gloom, the chandeliers were lowered from the ceiling, and  the messengers placed lamps on the tribune. The President made a sign,  the door on the right opened, and there was seen to enter the hall, and  rapidly ascend the tribune, a man still young, attired in black, having  on his breast the badge and riband of the Legion of Honour.    All eyes were turned towards this man. A pallid face, its bony  emaciated angles thrown into bold relief by the shaded lamps, a nose  large and long, moustaches, a curled lock of hair above a narrow  forehead, eyes small and dull, and with a timid and uneasy manner,  bearing no resemblance to the Emperor,--this man was Citizen  Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte.    During the murmurs which greeted his entrance, he remained for some  instants, his right hand in the breast of his buttoned coat, erect and  motionless on the tribune, the pediment of which bore these dates:  February 22, 23, 24; and above which were inscribed these three words:  _Liberty_, _Equality_, _Fraternity_.    Before being elected President of the Republic, Charles-Louis-Napoleon  Bonaparte had been a representative of the people for several months,  and though he had rarely attended a whole sitting, he had been  frequently seen in the seat he had selected, on the upper benches of  the Left, in the fifth row in the zone commonly called the Mountain,  behind his old preceptor, Representative Vieillard. This man, then,  was no new figure in the Assembly, yet his entrance on this occasion  produced a profound sensation. It was to all, to his friends as to his  foes, the future that entered, an unknown future. Amid the immense  murmur, produced by the whispered words of all present, his name  passed from mouth to mouth, coupled with most diverse opinions. His  antagonists detailed his adventures, his _coups-de-main_, Strasburg,  Boulogne, the tame eagle, and the piece of meat in the little hat. His  friends dwelt upon his exile, his proscription, his imprisonment, an  excellent work of his on the artillery, his writings at Ham, which  were marked, to a certain degree, with the liberal, democratic, and  socialistic spirit, the maturity of the more sober age at which he had  now arrived; and to those who recalled his follies, they recalled his  misfortunes.    General Cavaignac, who, not having been elected President, had just  resigned his power into the hands of the Assembly, with that tranquil  laconism which befits republics, was seated in his customary place at  the head of the ministerial bench, on the left of the tribune, and  observed in silence, with folded arms, this installation of the new  man.    At length silence was restored, the President of the Assembly struck  the table before him several times with his wooden knife, and then, the  last murmurs having subsided, said:    \"I will now read the form of the oath.\"    There was something almost religious about that moment. The Assembly  was no longer an Assembly, it was a temple. The immense significance of  the oath was rendered still more impressive by the circumstance that it  was the only oath taken throughout the whole territory of the Republic.  February had, and rightly, abolished the political oath, and the  Constitution had, as rightly, retained only the oath of the President.  This oath possessed the double character of necessity and of grandeur.  It was an oath taken by the executive, the subordinate power, to the  legislative, the superior power; it was even more than this--in  contrast to the monarchical fiction by which the people take the oath  to the man invested with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20587"],[0,"Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-1965 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net            [Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected,  author's spelling has been retained.  --Missing page numbers correspond to illustration or blank pages.]                                   INTEGRATION OF THE ARMED FORCES                                     1940-1965                                      _DEFENSE STUDIES SERIES_                                            INTEGRATION                                OF THE ARMED FORCES                                     1940-1965                                           _by_                             _Morris J.

Weigley                           Temple University          Foreword      The integration of the armed forces was a momentous event in our  military and national history; it represented a milestone in the  development of the armed forces and the fulfillment of the democratic  ideal. The existence of integrated rather than segregated armed forces  is an important factor in our military establishment today. The  experiences in World War II and the postwar pressures generated by the  civil rights movement compelled all the services--Army, Navy, Air  Force, and Marine Corps--to reexamine their traditional practices of  segregation. While there were differences in the ways that the  services moved toward integration, all were subject to the same  demands, fears, and prejudices and had the same need to use their  resources in a more rational and economical way. All of them reached  the same conclusion: traditional attitudes toward minorities must give  way to democratic concepts of civil rights.    If the integration of the armed services now seems to have been  inevitable in a democratic society, it nevertheless faced opposition  that had to be overcome and problems that had to be solved through the  combined efforts of political and civil rights leaders and civil and  military officials. In many ways the military services were at the  cutting edge in the struggle for racial equality. This volume sets  forth the successive measures they and the Office of the Secretary of  Defense took to meet the challenges of a new era in a critically  important area of human relationships, during a period of transition  that saw the advance of blacks in the social and economic order as  well as in the military. It is fitting that this story should be told  in the first volume of a new Defense Studies Series.    The Defense Historical Studies Program was authorized by the then  Deputy Secretary of Defense, Cyrus Vance, in April 1965. It is  conducted under the auspices of the Defense Historical Studies Group,  an _ad hoc_ body chaired by the Historian of the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and consisting of the senior officials in the  historical offices of the services and of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Volumes produced under its sponsorship will be interservice histories,  covering matters of mutual interest to the Army, Navy, Air Force,  Marine Corps, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The preparation of each  volume is entrusted to one of the service historical sections, in this  case the Army's Center of Military History. Although the book was  written by an Army historian, he was generously given access to the  pertinent records of the other services and the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, and this initial volume in the Defense Studies  Series covers the experiences of all components of the Department of  Defense in achieving integration.      Washington, D.C.                      JAMES L. COLLINS, Jr.    14 March 1980                         Brigadier General, USA                                          Chief of Military History          The Author      Morris J. MacGregor, Jr., received the A.B. and M.A. degrees in  history from the Catholic University of America. He continued his  graduate studies at the Johns Hopkins University and the University of  Paris on a Fulbright grant. Before joining the staff of the U.S. Army  Center of Military History in 1968 he served for ten years in the  Historical Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He has written  several studies for military publications including \"Armed Forces  Integration--Forced or Free?\" in _The Military and Society:  Proceedings of the Fifth Military Symposium of the U.S. Air Force  Academy_. He is the coeditor with Bernard C. Nalty of the  thirteen-volume _Blacks in the United States Armed Forces: Basic  Documents_ and with Ronald Spector of _Voices of History:  Interpretations in American Military History_. He is currently working  on a sequel to _Integration of the Armed Forces_ which will also  appear in the Defense Studies Series.          Preface                                                             (p. ix)      This book describes the fall of the legal, administrative, and social  barriers to the black American's full participation in the military  service of his country. It follows the changing status of the black  serviceman from the eve of World War II, when he was excluded from  many military activities and rigidly segregated in the rest, to that  period a quarter of a century later when the Department of Defense  extended its protection of his rights and privileges even to the  civilian community. To round out the story of open housing for members  of the military, I briefly overstep the closing date given in the  title.    The work is essentially an administrative history that attempts to  measure the influence of several forces, most notably the civil rights  movement, the tradition of segregated service, and the changing  concept of military efficiency, on the development of racial policies  in the armed forces. It is not a history of all minorities in the  services. Nor is it an account of how the black American responded to  discrimination. A study of racial attitudes, both black and white, in  the military services would be a valuable addition to human knowledge,  but practically impossible of accomplishment in the absence of  sufficient autobiographical accounts, oral history interviews, and  detailed sociological measurements. How did the serviceman view his  condition, how did he convey his desire for redress, and what was his  reaction to social change? Even now the answers to these questions are  blurred by time and distorted by emotions engendered by the civil  rights revolution. Few citizens, black or white, who witnessed it can  claim immunity to the influence of that paramount social phenomenon of  our times.    At times I do generalize on the attitudes of both black and white  servicemen and the black and white communities at large as well. But I  have permitted myself to do so only when these attitudes were clearly  pertinent to changes in the"]]]
