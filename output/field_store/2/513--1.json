WRITTEN, BY REQUEST,                   FOR THE \"U. S. JOURNAL OF HOMOEOPATHY,\"                              BY EMMA WILLARD.                                     NEW-YORK:      FRANCIS HART & CO. PRINTERS AND STATIONERS, 63 CORTLANDT STREET.                                   1861.                                           THEORY                                       OF                          CIRCULATION BY RESPIRATION.          SECTION I.    First step in the discovery--Animal Heat the product of Respiration.      Second step--Heat evolved in the lungs by Respiration there produces      Expansion. Third step--Expansion; implied motion, which from the      organism must conduct the blood to the left ventricle of the Heart.      Theory imperfect, until the formation of sufficient vapor or steam      in the lungs is perceived and acknowledged.    TO DR. MARCY.--In complying with your request to write for your journal  an article embodying my theory of the motive powers which produce the  circulation of the blood, together with some account of its rise and  progress, I obey what I regard as a call of duty; and thus requested, do  it with pleasure.    But my theory, with its history, cannot thus be written without egotism.  Logicians say, that the way to convince others is to retrace, in order,  the steps by which you yourself became convinced, which is to be  egotistic. But in this case, there is a further reason: the scientific  discoverer must speak of the apparatus by which he experiments, and mine  was often my own physical frame.    Twenty years ago, while yet my mind, laboring with this great subject,  was condemned                                    \"to drudge      Without a second and without a judge,\"    you, sir, comprehended the hypothesis which has now become a theory, and  you waited not for others to speak, but you fully acknowledged its  truth; and although, in Hartford, as now in New-York, you were thronged  with practice, (then allopathic), you yet found time to furnish me with  added experiments, made in your office, confirmatory of its truth, which  by your permission were afterwards added in your name to my published  work.    The first step in the theory occurred to my mind in the winter of 1822,  and while I was engaged in founding the Troy Female Seminary. Being in  attendance on a course of lectures on chemistry, and at the same time  teaching to a class Mrs. Marcett's excellent work on that subject, one  cold morning, as I was walking briskly up a hill, I said to myself, Why  do I grow warm? Whence comes this accession of caloric? It cannot be  transmitted to me from any object without, because every thing which  comes in contact with me is cold. Snow is under my feet, and frosty air  surrounds me; and, as to clothing, even the softest furs _impart_ no  warmth--they but keep from escaping that which comes from within. What  other method besides transmission is there of gaining heat? There is the  elimination of caloric, when, in substances chemically combining, weight  is gained and bulk is lost. Is there any such combination going on in  me? Yes; this atmospheric air, when I inspire it, has oxygen combined  with nitrogen; but when I expire, the oxygen has disappeared, and  heavier substances--carbonic acid gas and watery vapor--are returned in  its place. Thus, it must be, animal heat is evolved. It is the product  of respiration; and it is because I breathe faster and deeper, that more  carbon is oxidized or burned, and more heat is set free in my lungs; and  therefore I grow warm as I walk up this hill, though all around me is  cold.    The mind, excited by new and great thoughts, works with unwonted energy;  and mine at once collected so many proofs, that I became perfectly  convinced of the truth of the hypothesis. In searching books, I found  that Lavoisier had taught the same; but he dying, his doctrine was  discarded by English chemists, Dr. Black leading the way, and therefore  it did not then appear in English systems of chemistry. But from that  time, I cherished it with a mother's devotion, watched changes in my own  physical frame relating to it, taught it to my pupils, and held warm  disputes with the medical faculty, who opposed and contemned it.    In the summer of 1832, the Asiatic cholera appeared among us, appalling  every heart. This plague, I said, is a disease of coldness and  obstruction; and these doctors, wrong as they are on the subject of  animal heat, can never understand it--though, if Lavoisier were living,  he might. Let me, then, as best I may, consider anew the problem of heat  as produced by respiration, and see whether I cannot find out something  which has a bearing on the fatal coldness of this fearful disease. It is  into the lungs, and no where else, that breathing introduces atmospheric  air; and it is there that the oxidation of carbon or animal combustion  takes place. Thus must caloric be imparted to the blood in the lungs;  and in them is one-fifth of the blood of the system, of which  seven-eighths is water.    The nature of heat is to expand all fluids. The blood in the lungs must,  therefore, expand; and if it expands, it must move; and if it moves, it  must, from the organism of the parts, move to the left ventricle of the  heart, into which the valvular system opens to give it a free  passage--whereas the valves of the right close against it. \"Eureka!\" I  mentally exclaimed; \"I have found the _primum mobile_ of the circulation  of the blood.\" I had for years disbelieved that the heart's slight  mechanical impulse was that cause. In teaching Paley's \"Natural  Theology,\" my mind had come in contact with the passage in which he  describes the heart's more than Herculean labors; and I said, \"This is  altogether too much--the heart alone cannot perform all this--there must  be some other power,\" and an abiding desire to know what that power  could be, prepared me for receiving this great idea. But my mind was  agitated by it, as the sea is, when a great rock is thrown into its  waters.    The cholera was then raging around me; and as I prepared to flee from it  to a mountain air, I confided to a scientific friend, Professor Twiss of  West Point, my hypothesis, which I regarded as probably the incipient  germ of an important discovery.    But there was first the former theory to be disproved; and then there  were new points to be investigated and established. In the ensuing  winters of 1833, 4, and 5, I gave much attention to the subject, and  employed professors in my school in the departments of chemistry and  natural philosophy, who assisted me,--particularly by their ingenuity in  the construction of such simple pieces of apparatus as were needed.    Thus we proved that, although the heart's action gives pulsation, it  does not necessarily give circulation. By an endless india-rubber tube,  filled with water, coiled upon a table and struck repeatedly at one  point, a pulsation was produced throughout, but no circulation. By  affixing the tube to a vessel of water, and laying it on an inclined  plane, the water ran through it in an equable current, making  circulation with pulsation. Clasping the hand upon the tube in  successive contractions, the fluid passed on _per saltem_, producing  circulation and pulsation united, but no acceleration of the current.  Now, add valves to the tube on each side of the opening hand, and you  will have the current--which is moving by gravitation, accelerated by  the hand's impulse, as the blood's current, first moved by respiration,  undoubtedly is by the heart's beat.    The heart we regard as the grand regulator of the blood's flow; and it  is admirably situated for measuring out a regular portion of blood at  every contraction. John Bell, believing in the Harveian theory, said,  \"It is awful to think of the unfixed position of the heart;\" and  Dr. Arnott declared that \"the heart, the heart alone, is the ragged  anomaly in the laws of fitness in mechanics.\" The heart was now seen to  have a right position; for it should swing loose that its moorings be  not endangered; and, as whatever impugns the Creator's unerring wisdom  must be wrong, so the presumption is, that whatever vindicates it must  be right.    My hypothesis assumed the principle, that, if an endless hollow tube be  filled with a liquid, the liquid can be made to circulate perpetually,  if it be heated at one point and cooled before its return. A drawing of  the simple apparatus by which this problem was proved, is given in my  published work on \"the Motive Powers, &c.\" The figure which represents  this apparatus gives the learner the most simple idea possible of the  connection of the respiratory and circulatory systems, and of the  combination of the two motive powers; the first, or chemical, coming  from the lungs, and the second, or mechanical, from the heart.    Suppose the heart divided into right and left hearts by dissection at  the septum: the circulatory system might then be represented by an  endless tube. Let such an one, nine or ten feet in length, and of one  inch bore (to be filled with water) be placed upon a horizontal table.  Let an enlargement of the tube be made by a tin vessel to represent the  lungs, which shall contain about one-fifth part of the water. Let the  tube connected with the right side of the vessel have, at a little  distance from the vessel, a smaller enlargement, composed of  india-rubber, which can be grasped by the hand, to represent the heart's  right ventricle, with a valve on each side opening towards the tin  vessel, the two to represent the tricuspid and semi-lunar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#1)"],[1,"from the 1910 A. C. Fifield (revised) edition by David Price,  email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk            EREWHON, OR OVER THE RANGE         \"[Greek text]\"--ARIST.  _Pol_.       \"There is no action save upon a balance of     considerations.\"--_Paraphrase_.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION      The Author wishes it to be understood that Erewhon is pronounced as a  word of three syllables, all short--thus, E-re-whon.          PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION      Having been enabled by the kindness of the public to get through an  unusually large edition of \"Erewhon\" in a very short time, I have taken  the opportunity of a second edition to make some necessary corrections,  and to add a few passages where it struck me that they would be  appropriately introduced; the passages are few, and it is my fixed  intention never to touch the work again.    I may perhaps be allowed to say a word or two here in reference to \"The  Coming Race,\" to the success of which book \"Erewhon\" has been very  generally set down as due.  This is a mistake, though a perfectly natural  one.  The fact is that \"Erewhon\" was finished, with the exception of the  last twenty pages and a sentence or two inserted from time to time here  and there throughout the book, before the first advertisement of \"The  Coming Race\" appeared.  A friend having called my attention to one of the  first of these advertisements, and suggesting that it probably referred  to a work of similar character to my own, I took \"Erewhon\" to a  well-known firm of publishers on the 1st of May 1871, and left it in  their hands for consideration.  I then went abroad, and on learning that  the publishers alluded to declined the MS., I let it alone for six or  seven months, and, being in an out-of-the-way part of Italy, never saw a  single review of \"The Coming Race,\" nor a copy of the work.  On my  return, I purposely avoided looking into it until I had sent back my last  revises to the printer.  Then I had much pleasure in reading it, but was  indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two  books, in spite of their entire independence to one another.    I regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the  chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin's theory to an  absurdity.   Nothing could be further from my intention, and few things  would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin;  but I must own that I have myself to thank for the misconception, for I  felt sure that my intention would be missed, but preferred not to weaken  the chapters by explanation, and knew very well that Mr. Darwin's theory  would take no harm.  The only question in my mind was how far I could  afford to be misrepresented as laughing at that for which I have the most  profound admiration.  I am surprised, however, that the book at which  such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most  naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer; neither shall I  mention the name of the book here, though I should fancy that the hint  given will suffice.    I have been held by some whose opinions I respect to have denied men's  responsibility for their actions.   He who does this is an enemy who  deserves no quarter.  I should have imagined that I had been sufficiently  explicit, but have made a few additions to the chapter on Malcontents,  which will, I think, serve to render further mistake impossible.    An anonymous correspondent (by the hand-writing presumably a clergyman)  tells me that in quoting from the Latin grammar I should at any rate have  done so correctly, and that I should have written \"agricolas\" instead of  \"agricolae\".  He added something about any boy in the fourth form, &c.,  &c., which I shall not quote, but which made me very uncomfortable.  It  may be said that I must have misquoted from design, from ignorance, or by  a slip of the pen; but surely in these days it will be recognised as  harsh to assign limits to the all-embracing boundlessness of truth, and  it will be more reasonably assumed that each of the three possible causes  of misquotation must have had its share in the apparent blunder.  The art  of writing things that shall sound right and yet be wrong has made so  many reputations, and affords comfort to such a large number of readers,  that I could not venture to neglect it; the Latin grammar, however, is a  subject on which some of the younger members of the community feel  strongly, so I have now written \"agricolas\".  I have also parted with the  word \"infortuniam\" (though not without regret), but have not dared to  meddle with other similar inaccuracies.    For the inconsistencies in the book, and I am aware that there are not a  few, I must ask the indulgence of the reader.  The blame, however, lies  chiefly with the Erewhonians themselves, for they were really a very  difficult people to understand.  The most glaring anomalies seemed to  afford them no intellectual inconvenience; neither, provided they did not  actually see the money dropping out of their pockets, nor suffer  immediate physical pain, would they listen to any arguments as to the  waste of money and happiness which their folly caused them.  But this had  an effect of which I have little reason to complain, for I was allowed  almost to call them life-long self-deceivers to their faces, and they  said it was quite true, but that it did not matter.    I must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my  critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which  they have treated my adventures.    June 9, 1872          PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION      My publisher wishes me to say a few words about the genesis of the work,  a revised and enlarged edition of which he is herewith laying before the  public.  I therefore place on record as much as I can remember on this  head after a lapse of more than thirty years.    The first part of \"Erewhon\" written was an article headed \"Darwin among  the Machines,\" and signed Cellarius.  It was written in the Upper  Rangitata district of the Canterbury Province (as it then was) of New  Zealand, and appeared at Christchurch in the Press Newspaper, June 13,  1863.  A copy of this article is indexed under my books in the British  Museum catalogue.  In passing, I may say that the opening chapters of  \"Erewhon\" were also drawn from the Upper Rangitata district, with such  modifications as I found convenient.    A second article on the same subject as the one just referred to appeared  in the Press shortly after the first, but I have no copy.  It treated  Machines from a different point of view, and was the basis of pp. 270-274  of the present edition of \"Erewhon.\" {1} This view ultimately led me to  the theory I put forward in \"Life and Habit,\" published in November 1877.  I have put a bare outline of this theory (which I believe to be quite  sound) into the mouth of an Erewhonian philosopher in Chapter XXVII. of  this book.    In 1865 I rewrote and enlarged \"Darwin among the Machines\" for the  Reasoner, a paper published in London by Mr. G. J. Holyoake.  It appeared  July 1, 1865, under the heading, \"The Mechanical Creation,\" and can be  seen in the British Museum.  I again rewrote and enlarged it, till it  assumed the form in which it appeared in the first edition of \"Erewhon.\"    The next part of \"Erewhon\" that I wrote was the \"World of the Unborn,\" a  preliminary form of which was sent to Mr. Holyoake's paper, but as I  cannot find it among those copies of the Reasoner that are in the British  Museum, I conclude that it was not accepted.  I have, however, rather a  strong fancy that it appeared in some London paper of the same character  as the Reasoner, not very long after July 1, 1865, but I have no copy.    I also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the  Musical Banks, and the trial of a man for being in a consumption.  These  four detached papers were, I believe, all that was written of \"Erewhon\"  before 1870.  Between 1865 and 1870 I wrote hardly anything, being  hopeful of attaining that success as a painter which it has not been  vouchsafed me to attain, but in the autumn of 1870, just as I was  beginning to get occasionally hung at Royal Academy exhibitions, my  friend, the late Sir F. N. (then Mr.) Broome, suggested to me that I  should add somewhat to the articles I had already written, and string  them together into a book.  I was rather fired by the idea, but as I only  worked at the MS. on Sundays it was some months before I had completed  it.    I see from my second Preface that I took the book to Messrs. Chapman &  Hall May 1, 1871, and on their rejection of it, under the advice of one  who has attained the highest rank among living writers, I let it sleep,  till I took it to Mr. Trubner early in 1872.  As regards its rejection by  Messrs. Chapman & Hall, I believe their reader advised them quite wisely.  They told me he reported that it was a philosophical work, little likely  to be popular with a large circle of readers.  I hope that if I had been  their reader, and the book had been submitted to myself, I should have  advised them to the same effect.    \"Erewhon\" appeared with the last day or two of March 1872.  I attribute  its unlooked-for success mainly to two early favourable reviews--the  first in the Pall Mall Gazette of April 12, and the second in the  Spectator of April 20.  There was also another cause.  I was complaining  once to a friend that though \"Erewhon\" had met with such a warm  reception, my subsequent books had been all of them practically still-  born.  He said, \"You forget one charm that 'Erewhon' had, but which none  of your other books can have.\"  I asked what? and was answered, \"The  sound of a new voice, and of an unknown voice.\"    The first edition of \"Erewhon\" sold in about three weeks; I had not taken  moulds, and as the demand was strong, it was set up again"]]]
