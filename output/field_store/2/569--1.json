A SPELLING DRILL        APPENDIX        The Art of Writing and Speaking the English Language    GENERAL INTRODUCTION    If there is a subject of really universal interest and utility,  it is the art of writing and speaking one's own language effectively.  It is the basis of culture, as we all know; but it is infinitely more  than that: it is the basis of business.  No salesman can sell anything  unless he can explain the merits of his goods in _effective_ English  (among our people), or can write an advertisement equally effective,  or present his ideas, and the facts, in a letter.  Indeed, the way  we talk, and write letters, largely determines our success in life.    Now it is well for us to face at once the counter-statement that the  most ignorant and uncultivated men often succeed best in business, and  that misspelled, ungrammatical advertisements have brought in millions  of dollars.  It is an acknowledged fact that our business circulars  and letters are far inferior in correctness to those of Great Britain;  yet they are more effective in getting business.  As far as spelling  is concerned, we know that some of the masters of literature have been  atrocious spellers and many suppose that when one can sin in such  company, sinning is, as we might say, a \"beauty spot\", a defect in  which we can even take pride.    Let us examine the facts in the case more closely.  First of all,  language is no more than a medium; it is like air to the creatures of  the land or water to fishes.  If it is perfectly clear and pure, we do  not notice it any more than we notice pure air when the sun is shining  in a clear sky, or the taste of pure cool water when we drink a glass  on a hot day.  Unless the sun is shining, there is no brightness;  unless the water is cool, there is no refreshment.  The source of all  our joy in the landscape, of the luxuriance of fertile nature,  is the sun and not the air.  Nature would be more prodigal in Mexico than  in Greenland, even if the air in Mexico were as full of soot and smoke as  the air of Pittsburg{h}, or loaded with the acid from a chemical factory.  So it is with language.  Language is merely a medium for thoughts,  emotions, the intelligence of a finely wrought brain, and a good  mind will make far more out of a bad medium than a poor mind will  make out of the best.  A great violinist will draw such music from  the cheapest violin that the world is astonished.  However is that any  reason why the great violinist should choose to play on a poor violin;  or should one say nothing of the smoke nuisance in Chicago because  more light and heat penetrate its murky atmosphere than are to be found  in cities only a few miles farther north?  The truth is, we must regard  the bad spelling nuisance, the bad grammar nuisance, the inartistic and  rambling language nuisance, precisely as we would the smoke nuisance,  the sewer-gas nuisance, the stock-yards' smell nuisance.  Some dainty  people prefer pure air and correct language; but we now recognize that  purity is something more than an esthetic fad, that it is essential to our  health and well-being, and therefore it becomes a matter of universal  public interest, in language as well as in air.    There is a general belief that while bad air may be a positive evil  influence, incorrect use of language is at most no more than a negative  evil: that while it may be a good thing to be correct, no special harm  is involved in being incorrect.  Let us look into this point.    While language as the medium of thought may be compared to air as  the medium of the sun's influence, in other respects it is like the  skin of the body; a scurvy skin shows bad blood within, and a scurvy  language shows inaccurate thought and a confused mind.  And as a  disease once fixed on the skin reacts and poisons the blood in  turn as it has first been poisoned by the blood, so careless use of  language if indulged reacts on the mind to make it permanently and  increasingly careless, illogical, and inaccurate in its thinking.    The ordinary person will probably not believe this, because he conceives  of good use of language as an accomplishment to be learned from books,  a prim system of genteel manners to be put on when occasion demands,  a sort of superficial education in the correct thing, or, as the boys  would say, \"the proper caper.\"  In this, however, he is mistaken.  Language which expresses the thought with strict logical accuracy is  correct language, and language which is sufficiently rich in its resources  to express thought fully, in all its lights and bearings, is effective  language.  If the writer or speaker has a sufficient stock of words and  forms at his disposal, he has only to use them in a strictly logical way  and with sufficient fulness to be both correct and effective.  If his mind  can always be trusted to work accurately, he need not know a word of  grammar except what he has imbibed unconsciously in getting his stock of  words and expressions.  Formal grammar is purely for critical purposes.  It is no more than a standard measuring stick by which to try the  work that has been done and find out if it is imperfect at any point.  Of course constant correction of inaccuracies schools the mind and  puts it on its guard so that it will be more careful the next time  it attempts expression; but we cannot avoid the conclusion that if  the mind lacks material, lacks knowledge of the essential elements  of the language, it should go to the original source from which it got  its first supply, namely to reading and hearing that which is acknowledged  to be correct and sufficient---as the child learns from its mother.  All the scholastic and analytic grammar in the world will not  enrich the mind in language to any appreciable extent.    And now we may consider another objector, who says, \"I have studied  grammar for years and it has done me no good.\"  In view of what has  just been said, we may easily concede that such is very likely to  have been the case.  A measuring stick is of little value unless you  have something to measure.  Language cannot be acquired, only tested,  by analysis, and grammar is an analytic, not a constructive science.    We have compared bad use of language to a scurvy condition of the skin.  To cure the skin we must doctor the blood; and to improve the language  we should begin by teaching the mind to think.  But that, you will say,  is a large undertaking.  Yes, but after all it is the most direct and  effective way.  All education should be in the nature of teaching  the mind to think, and the teaching of language consists in teaching  thinking in connection with word forms and expression through language.  The unfortunate thing is that teachers of language have failed  to go to the root of the trouble, and enormous effort has  counted for nothing, and besides has led to discouragement.    The American people are noted for being hasty in all they do.  Their manufactures are quickly made and cheap.  They have not  hitherto had time to secure that perfection in minute details which  constitutes \"quality.\"  The slow-going Europeans still excel in  nearly all fine and high-grade forms of manufacture---fine pottery,  fine carpets and rugs, fine cloth, fine bronze and other art wares.  In our language, too, we are hasty, and therefore imperfect.  Fine logical accuracy requires more time than we have had  to give to it, and we read the newspapers, which are very poor  models of language, instead of books, which should be far better.  Our standard of business letters is very low.  It is rare to  find a letter of any length without one or more errors of language,  to say nothing of frequent errors in spelling made by ignorant  stenographers and not corrected by the business men who sign the letters.    But a change is coming over us.  We have suddenly taken to reading  books, and while they are not always the best books, they are better  than newspapers.  And now a young business man feels that it is  distinctly to his advantage if he can dictate a thoroughly good  letter to his superior or to a well informed customer.  Good letters  raise the tone of a business house, poor letters give the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note:    Typographical errors have been corrected.

They are a branch of the great [v]Appalachian[9-*] family,  and are seen away to the west of the river, swelling up to a noble  height, and lording it over the surrounding country. Every change of  season, every change of weather, indeed, every hour of the day, produces  some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains, and they  are regarded by all the goodwives, far and near, as perfect  [v]barometers.    At the foot of these fairy mountains the traveler may have seen the  light smoke curling up from a village, whose shingle roofs gleam among  the trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the  fresh green of the nearer landscape. It is a little village of great  age, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists in the early  times of the province, just about the beginning of the government of the  good Peter [v]Stuyvesant (may he rest in peace!), and there were some of  the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years, built  of small yellow bricks brought from Holland, having latticed windows and  gable fronts, surmounted with weathercocks.    In that same village, and in one of these very houses, there lived, many  years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain, a  simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a  descendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the  [v]chivalrous days of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege  of Fort Christina. He inherited, however, but little of the martial  character of his ancestors. I have observed that he was a simple,  good-natured man; he was, moreover, a kind neighbor and an obedient,  henpecked husband.    Certain it is that he was a great favorite among all the goodwives of  the village, who took his part in all family squabbles; and never  failed, whenever they talked those matters over in their evening  gossipings, to lay all the blame on Dame Van Winkle. The children of the  village, too, would shout with joy whenever he approached. He assisted  at their sports, made their playthings, taught them to fly kites and  shoot marbles, and told them long stories of ghosts, witches, and  Indians. Whenever he went dodging about the village, he was surrounded  by a troop of them, hanging on his skirts, clambering on his back, and  playing a thousand tricks on him; and not a dog would bark at him  throughout the neighborhood.    The great error in Rip's composition was a strong dislike of all kinds  of profitable labor. It could not be from the want of perseverance; for  he would sit on a wet rock, with a rod as long and heavy as a lance, and  fish all day without a murmur, even though he should not be encouraged  by a single nibble. He would carry a fowling piece on his shoulder for  hours together, trudging through woods and swamps, and up hill and down  dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons. He would never refuse to  assist a neighbor even in the roughest toil, and was a foremost man at  all country frolics for husking Indian corn, or building stone fences;  the women of the village, too, used to employ him to run their errands,  and to do such little odd jobs as their less obliging husbands would not  do for them. In a word, Rip was ready to attend to anybody's business  but his own; but as to doing family duty, and keeping his farm in order,  he found it impossible.    His children, too, were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to  nobody. His son Rip promised to inherit the habits, with the old  clothes, of his father. He was generally seen trooping like a colt at  his mother's heels, equipped in a pair of his father's cast-off  breeches, which he had much ado to hold up with one hand, as a fine lady  does her train in bad weather.    Rip Van Winkle, however, was one of those happy mortals, of foolish,  well-oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or  brown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would  rather starve on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself, he  would have whistled life away in perfect contentment; but his wife kept  continually dinning in his ear about his idleness, his carelessness, and  the ruin he was bringing on his family. Morning, noon, and night, her  tongue was incessantly going, and everything he said or did was sure to  produce a torrent of household eloquence. Rip had but one way of  replying to all lectures of the kind, and that, by frequent use, had  grown into a habit. He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast up  his eyes, but said nothing. This, however, always provoked a"]]]
