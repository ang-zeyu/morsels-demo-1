PRAYER     EVIL     THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUL     THE FOUR KINDS OF LOVE     TABLET REVEALED BY 'ABDU'L-BAHA              PART I          THE DUTY OF KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY TOWARDS STRANGERS AND FOREIGNERS      October 16th and 17th, 1911    When a man turns his face to God he finds sunshine everywhere. All men are  his brothers. Let not conventionality cause you to seem cold and  unsympathetic when you meet strange people from other countries. Do not  look at them as though you suspected them of being evil-doers, thieves and  boors. You think it necessary to be very careful, not to expose yourselves  to the risk of making acquaintance with such, possibly, undesirable  people.    I ask you not to think only of yourselves. Be kind to the strangers,  whether come they from Turkey, Japan, Persia, Russia, China or any other  country in the world.    Help to make them feel at home; find out where they are staying, ask if  you may render them any service; try to make their lives a little happier.    In this way, even if, sometimes, what you at first suspected should be  true, still go out of your way to be kind to them--this kindness will help  them to become better.    After all, why should any foreign people be treated as strangers?    Let those who meet you know, without your proclaiming the fact, that you  are indeed a Baha'i.    Put into practice the Teaching of Baha'u'llah, that of kindness to all  nations. Do not be content with showing friendship in words alone, let  your heart burn with loving kindness for all who may cross your path.    Oh, you of the Western nations, be kind to those who come from the Eastern  world to sojourn among you. Forget your conventionality when you speak  with them; they are not accustomed to it. To Eastern peoples this  demeanour seems cold, unfriendly. Rather let your manner be sympathetic.  Let it be seen that you are filled with universal love. When you meet a  Persian or any other stranger, speak to him as to a friend; if he seems to  be lonely try to help him, give him of your willing service; if he be sad  console him, if poor succour him, if oppressed rescue him, if in misery  comfort him. In so doing you will manifest that not in words only, but in  deed and in truth, you think of all men as your brothers.    What profit is there in agreeing that universal friendship is good, and  talking of the solidarity of the human race as a grand ideal? Unless these  thoughts are translated into the world of action, they are useless.    The wrong in the world continues to exist just because people talk only of  their ideals, and do not strive to put them into practice. If actions took  the place of words, the world's misery would very soon be changed into  comfort.    A man who does great good, and talks not of it, is on the way to  perfection.    The man who has accomplished a small good and magnifies it in his speech  is worth very little.    If I love you, I need not continually speak of my love--you will know  without any words. On the other hand if I love you not, that also will you  know--and you would not believe me, were I to tell you in a thousand words,  that I loved you.    People make much profession of goodness, multiplying fine words because  they wish to be thought greater and better than their fellows, seeking  fame in the eyes of the world. Those who do most good use fewest words  concerning their actions.    The children of God do the works without boasting, obeying His laws.    My hope for you is that you will ever avoid tyranny and oppression; that  you will work without ceasing till justice reigns in every land, that you  will keep your hearts pure and your hands free from unrighteousness.    This is what the near approach to God requires from you, and this is what  I expect of you.          THE POWER AND VALUE OF TRUE THOUGHT DEPEND UPON ITS MANIFESTATION IN  ACTION      October 18th    The reality of man is his thought, not his material body. The thought  force and the animal force are partners. Although man is part of the  animal creation, he possesses a power of thought superior to all other  created beings.    If a man's thought is constantly aspiring towards heavenly subjects then  does he become saintly; if on the other hand his thought does not soar,  but is directed downwards to centre itself upon the things of this world,  he grows more and more material until he arrives at a state little better  than that of a mere animal.    Thoughts may be divided into two classes:    (1st) Thought that belongs to the world of thought alone.    (2nd) Thought that expresses itself in action.    Some men and women glory in their exalted thoughts, but if these thoughts  never reach the plane of action they remain useless: the power of thought  is dependent on its manifestation in deeds. A philosopher's thought may,  however, in the world of progress and evolution, translate itself into the  actions of other people, even when they themselves are unable or unwilling  to show forth their grand ideals in their own lives. To this class the  majority of philosophers belong, their teachings being high above their  actions. This is the difference between philosophers who are Spiritual  Teachers, and those who are mere philosophers: the Spiritual Teacher is  the first to follow His own teaching; He brings down into the world of  action His spiritual conceptions and ideals. His Divine thoughts are made  manifest to the world. His thought is Himself, from which He is  inseparable. When we find a philosopher emphasizing the importance and  grandeur of justice, and then encouraging a rapacious monarch in his  oppression and tyranny, we quickly realize that he belongs to the first  class: for he thinks heavenly thoughts and does not practise the  corresponding heavenly virtues.    This state is impossible with Spiritual Philosophers, for they ever  express their high and noble thoughts in actions.
