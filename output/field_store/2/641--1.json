THE PAPYRUS       THE BANQUET       THE PAPYRUS (resumed)       PART III. THE EUPHORBIA            THAIS          PART THE FIRST -- THE LOTUS    In those days there were many hermits living in the desert. On both  banks of the Nile numerous huts, built by these solitary dwellers, of  branches held together by clay, were scattered at a little distance from  each other, so that the inhabitants could live alone, and yet help one  another in case of need. Churches, each surmounted by a cross, stood  here and there amongst the huts, and the monks flocked to them at each  festival to celebrate the services or to partake of the Communion. There  were also, here and there on the banks of the river, monasteries, where  the cenobites lived in separate cells, and only met together that they  might the better enjoy their solitude.    Both hermits and cenobites led abstemious lives, taking no food till  after sunset, and eating nothing but bread with a little salt and  hyssop. Some retired into the desert, and led a still more strange life  in some cave or tomb.    All lived in temperance and chastity; they wore a hair shirt and a hood,  slept on the bare ground after long watching, prayed, sang psalms, and,  in short, spent their days in works of penitence. As an atonement  for original sin, they refused their body not only all pleasures and  satisfactions, but even that care and attention which in this age are  deemed indispensable. They believed that the diseases of our members  purify our souls, and the flesh could put on no adornment more glorious  than wounds and ulcers. Thus, they thought they fulfilled the words of  the prophet, \"The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.\"    Amongst the inhabitants of the holy Thebaid, there were some who  passed their days in asceticism and contemplation; others gained their  livelihood by plaiting palm fibre, or by working at harvest-time for  the neighbouring farmers. The Gentiles wrongly suspected some of them  of living by brigandage, and allying themselves to the nomadic Arabs  who robbed the caravans. But, as a matter of fact, the monks despised  riches, and the odour of their sanctity rose to heaven.    Angels in the likeness of young men, came, staff in hand, as travellers,  to visit the hermitages; whilst demons--having assumed the form of  Ethiopians or of animals--wandered round the habitations of the hermits  in order to lead them into temptation. When the monks went in the  morning to fill their pitcher at the spring, they saw the footprints  of Satyrs and Aigipans in the sand. The Thebaid was, really and  spiritually, a battlefield, where, at all times, and more especially at  night, there were terrible conflicts between heaven and hell.    The ascetics, furiously assailed by legions of the damned, defended  themselves--with the help of God and the angels--by fasting, prayer,  and penance. Sometimes carnal desires pricked them so cruelly that  they cried aloud with pain, and their lamentations rose to the starlit  heavens mingled with the howls of the hungry hyaenas. Then it was that  the demons appeared in delightful forms. For though the demons are, in  reality, hideous, they sometimes assume an appearance of beauty which  prevents their real nature from being recognised. The ascetics of the  Thebaid were amazed to see in their cells phantasms of delights unknown  even to the voluptuaries of the age. But, as they were under the sign  of the Cross, they did not succumb to these temptations, and the unclean  spirits, assuming again their true character, fled at daybreak, filled  with rage and shame. It was not unusual to meet at dawn one of these  beings, flying away and weeping, and replying to those who questioned  it, \"I weep and groan because one of the Christians who live here has  beaten me with rods, and driven me away in ignominy.\"    The power of the old saints of the desert extended over all sinners and  unbelievers. Their goodness was sometimes terrible. They derived from  the Apostles authority to punish all offences against the true and only  God, and no earthly power could save those they condemned. Strange tales  were told in the cities, and even as far as Alexandria, how the earth  had opened and swallowed up certain wicked persons whom one of these  saints struck with his staff. Therefore they were feared by all  evil-doers, and particularly by mimes, mountebanks, married priests, and  prostitutes.    Such was the sanctity of these holy men that even wild beasts felt their  power. When a hermit was about to die, a lion came and dug a grave with  its claws. The saint knew by this that God had called him, and he went  and kissed all his brethren on the cheek. Then he lay down joyfully, and  slept in the Lord.    Now that Anthony, who was more than a hundred years old, had retired  to Mount Colzin with his well-beloved disciples, Macarius and Amathas,  there was no monk in the Thebaid more renowned for good works than  Paphnutius, the Abbot of Antinoe. Ephrem and Serapion had a greater  number of followers, and in the spiritual and temporal management  of their monasteries surpassed him. But Paphnutius observed the most  rigorous fasts, and often went for three entire days without taking  food. He wore a very rough hair shirt, he flogged himself night and  morning, and lay for hours with his face to the earth.    His twenty-four disciples had built their huts near his, and imitated  his austerities. He loved them all dearly in Jesus Christ, and  unceasingly exhorted them to good works. Amongst his spiritual children  were men who had been robbers for many years, and had been persuaded by  the exhortations of the holy abbot to embrace the monastic life, and who  now edified their companions by the purity of their lives. One, who had  been cook to the Queen of Abyssinia, and was converted by the Abbot of  Antinoe, never ceased to weep. There was also Flavian, the deacon, who  knew the Scriptures, and spoke well; but the disciple of Paphnutius who  surpassed all the others in holiness was a young peasant named Paul, and  surnamed the Fool, because of his extreme simplicity. Men laughed at his  childishness, but God favoured him with visions, and by bestowing upon  him the gift of prophecy.    Paphnutius passed his life in teaching his disciples, and in ascetic  practices. Often did he meditate upon the Holy Scriptures in order to  find allegories in them. Therefore he abounded in good works, though  still young. The devils, who so rudely assailed the good hermits, did  not dare to approach him. At night, seven little jackals sat in the  moonlight in front of his cell, silent and motionless, and with their  ears pricked up. It was believed that they were seven devils, who, owing  to his sanctity, could not cross his threshold.    Paphnutius was born at Alexandria of noble parents, who had instructed  him in all profane learning. He had even been allured by the falsehoods  of the poets, and in his early youth had been misguided enough to  believe that the human race had all been drowned by a deluge in the days  of Deucalion, and had argued with his fellow-scholars concerning the  nature, the attributes, and even the existence of God. He then led a  life of dissipation, after the manner of the Gentiles, and he recalled  the memory of those days with shame and horror.    \"At that time,\" he used to say to the brethren, \"I seethed in the  cauldron of false delights.\"    He meant by that that he had eaten food properly dressed, and frequented  the public baths. In fact, until his twentieth year he had continued  to lead the ordinary existence of those times, which now seemed to  him rather death than life; but, owing to the lessons of the priest  Macrinus, he then became a new man.    The truth penetrated him through and through, and--as he used to  say--entered his soul like a sword. He embraced the faith of Calvary,  and worshipped Christ crucified. After his baptism he remained yet a  year amongst the Gentiles, unable to cast off the bonds of old habits.  But one day he entered a church, and heard a deacon read from the Bible,  the verse, \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and  give to the poor.\" Thereupon he sold all that he had, gave away the  money in alms, and embraced the monastic life.    During the ten years that he had lived remote from men, he no longer  seethed in the cauldron of false delights, but more profitably macerated  his flesh in the balms of penitence.    One day when, according to his pious custom, he was recalling to mind  the hours he had lived apart from God, and examining his sins one by  one, that he might the better ponder on their enormity, he remembered  that he had seen at the theatre at Alexandria a very beautiful actress  named Thais. This woman showed herself in the public games, and did not  scruple to perform dances, the movements of which, arranged only too  cleverly, brought to mind the most horrible passions. Sometimes she  imitated the horrible deeds which the Pagan fables ascribe to Venus,  Leda, or Pasiphae. Thus she fired all the spectators with lust, and when  handsome young men, or rich old ones, came, inspired with love, to hang  wreaths of flowers round her door, she welcomed them, and gave herself  up to them. So that, whilst she lost her own soul, she also ruined the  souls of many others.    She had almost led Paphnutius himself into the sins of the flesh. She  had awakened desire in him, and he had once approached the house of  Thais. But he stopped on the threshold of the courtesan's house, partly  restrained by the natural timidity of extreme youth--he was then but  fifteen years old--and partly by the fear of being refused on account  of his want of money, for his parents took care that he should commit no  great extravagances.

INTRODUCTION      Unassuming in plot and style, \"Heidi\" may none the less lay claim to  rank as a world classic. In the first place, both background and  characters ring true. The air of the Alps is wafted to us in every  page; the house among the pines, the meadows, and the eagle poised  above the naked rocks form a picture that no one could willingly  forget. And the people, from the kindly towns-folk to the quaint and  touching peasant types, are as real as any representation of human  nature need be. Every goat even, has its personality. As for the  little heroine, she is a blessing not only to everyone in the story,  but to everyone who reads it. The narrative merits of the book are too  apparent to call for comment.    As to the author, Johanna Spyri, she has so entirely lost herself in  her creation that we may pass over her career rather rapidly. She was  born in Switzerland in 1829, came of a literary family, and devoted  all her talent to the writing of books for and about children.    Since \"Heidi\" has been so often translated into English it may well be  asked why there is any need for a new version. The answer lies partly  in the conventional character of the previous translations. Now, if  there is any quality in \"Heidi\" that gives it a particular charm, that  quality is freshness, absolute spontaneity. To be sure, the story is  so attractive that it could never be wholly spoiled; but has not the  reader the right to enjoy it in English at least very nearly as much  as he could in German? The two languages are so different in nature  that anything like a literal rendering of one into the other is sure  to result in awkwardness and indirectness. Such a book must be not  translated, but re-lived and re-created.    To perform such a feat the writer must, to begin with, be familiar  with the mountains, and able to appreciate with Wordsworth        The silence that is in the starry sky,      The sleep that is among the lonely hills.    The translator of the present version was born and reared in a region  closely similar to that of the story. Her home was originally in the  picturesque town of Salzburg, and her father, Franz von Pausinger, was  one of the greatest landscape painters of his country and generation.  Another equally important requisite is knowledge of children. It  happens that this translator has a daughter just the age of the  heroine, who moreover loves to dress in Tyrolese costume. To translate  \"Heidi\" was for her therefore a labor of love, which means that the  love contended with and overcame the labor.    The English style of the present version is, then, distinctive. It has  often been noticed that those who acquire a foreign language often  learn to speak it with unusual clearness and purity. For illustration  we need go no further than Joseph Conrad, a Pole, probably the  greatest master of narrative English writing to-day; or to our own  fellow-citizen Carl Schurz. In the present case, the writer has lived  seven years in America and has strengthened an excellent training with  a wide reading of the best English classics.    Many people say that they read without noticing the author's style.  This is seldom quite true; unconsciously every one is impressed in  some way or other by the style of every book, or by its lack of style.  Children are particularly sensitive in this respect and should,  therefore, as much as is practicable, read only the best. In the new  translation of \"Heidi\" here offered to the public I believe that most  readers will notice an especial flavor, that very quality of delight  in mountain scenes, in mountain people and in child life generally,  which is one of the chief merits of the German original. The phrasing  has also been carefully adapted to the purpose of reading aloud--a  thing that few translators think of. In conclusion, the author,  realising the difference between the two languages, has endeavored to  write the story afresh, as Johanna Spyri would have written it had  English been her native tongue. How successful the attempt has been  the reader will judge.
