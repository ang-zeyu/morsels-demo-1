Even Pope who \"lisped in numbers for  the numbers came,\" did not add to our Anthology from his cradle, though  he may therein have acquired his monotonous rocking-metre. Immaturity of  mind and experience, so easily disguised on the stage or the  music-stool--even by adults--is more obvious in the field of pure  intellect. The contribution with which Mary Antin makes her debut in  letters is, however, saved from the emptiness of embryonic thinking by  being a record of a real experience, the greatest of her life; her  journey from Poland to Boston. Even so, and remarkable as her  description is for a girl of eleven--for it was at this age that she  first wrote the thing in Yiddish, though she was thirteen when she  translated it into English--it would scarcely be worth publishing merely  as a literary curiosity. But it happens to possess an extraneous value.  For, despite the great wave of Russian immigration into the United  States, and despite the noble spirit in which the Jews of America have  grappled with the invasion, we still know too little of the inner  feelings of the people themselves, nor do we adequately realize what  magic vision of free America lures them on to face the great journey to  the other side of the world.    Mary Antin's vivid description of all she and her dear ones went  through, enables us to see almost with our own eyes how the invasion of  America appears to the impecunious invader. It is thus \"a human  document\" of considerable value, as well as a promissory note of future  performance. The quick senses of the child, her keen powers of  observation and introspection, her impressionability both to sensations  and complex emotions--these are the very things out of which literature  is made; the raw stuff of art. Her capacity to handle English--after so  short a residence in America--shows that she possesses also the  instrument of expression. More fortunate than the poet of the Ghetto,  Morris Rosenfeld, she will have at her command the most popular language  in the world, and she has already produced in it passages of true  literature, especially in her impressionistic rendering of the sea and  the bustling phantasmagoria of travel.    What will be her development no one can say precisely, and I would not  presume either to predict or to direct it, for \"the wind bloweth where  it listeth.\" It will probably take lyrical shape. Like most modern  Jewesses who have written, she is, I fear, destined to spiritual  suffering: fortunately her work evidences a genial talent for enjoyment  and a warm humanity which may serve to counterbalance the curse of  reflectiveness. That she is growing, is evident from her own  Introduction, written only the other day, with its touches of humor and  more complex manipulation of groups of facts. But I have ventured to  counsel delay rather than precipitation in production--for she is not  yet sixteen--and the completion of her education, physical no less than  intellectual; and it is to this purpose that such profits as may accrue  from this publication will be devoted. Let us hope this premature  recognition of her potentialities will not injure their future  flowering, and that her development will add to those spiritual and  intellectual forces of which big-hearted American Judaism stands sorely  in need. I should explain in conclusion, that I have neither added nor  subtracted, even a comma, and that I have no credit in \"discovering\"  Mary Antin. I did but endorse the verdict of that kind and charming  Boston household in which I had the pleasure of encountering the gifted  Polish girl, and to a member of which this little volume is  appropriately dedicated.    I. ZANGWILL.          PREFATORY      In the year 1891, a mighty wave of the emigration movement swept over  all parts of Russia, carrying with it a vast number of the Jewish  population to the distant shores of the New World--from tyranny to  democracy, from darkness to light, from bondage and persecution to  freedom, justice and equality. But the great mass knew nothing of these  things; they were going to the foreign world in hopes only of earning  their bread and worshiping their God in peace. The different currents  that directed the course of that wave cannot be here enumerated. Suffice  it to say that its power was enormous. All over the land homes were  broken up, families separated, lives completely altered, for a common  end.    The emigration fever was at its height in Plotzk, my native town, in the  central western part of Russia, on the Dvina River. \"America\" was in  everybody's mouth. Business men talked of it over their accounts; the  market women made up their quarrels that they might discuss it from  stall to stall; people who had relatives in the famous land went around  reading their letters for the enlightenment of less fortunate folks; the  one letter-carrier informed the public how many letters arrived from  America, and who were the recipients; children played at emigrating; old  folks shook their sage heads over the evening fire, and prophesied no  good for those who braved the terrors of the sea and the foreign goal  beyond it;--all talked of it, but scarcely anybody knew one true fact  about this magic land. For book-knowledge was not for them; and a few  persons--they were a dressmaker's daughter, and a merchant with his two  sons--who had returned from America after a long visit, happened to be  endowed with extraordinary imagination, (a faculty closely related to  their knowledge of their old country-men's ignorance), and their  descriptions of life across the ocean, given daily, for some months, to  eager audiences, surpassed anything in the Arabian Nights. One sad fact  threw a shadow over the splendor of the gold-paved, Paradise-like  fairyland. The travelers all agreed that Jews lived there in the most  shocking impiety.    Driven by a necessity for bettering the family circumstances, and by  certain minor forces which cannot now be named, my father began to think  seriously of casting his lot with the great stream of emigrants. Many  family councils were held before it was agreed that the plan must be  carried out. Then came the parting; for it was impossible for the whole  family to go at once. I remember it, though I was only eight. It struck  me as rather interesting to stand on the platform before the train, with  a crowd of friends weeping in sympathy with us, and father waving his  hat for our special benefit, and saying--the last words we heard him  speak as the train moved off--    \"Good-bye, Plotzk, forever!\"    Then followed three long years of hope and doubt for father in America  and us in Russia. There were toil and suffering and waiting and anxiety  for all. There were--but to tell of all that happened in those years I  should have to write a separate history. The happy day came when we  received the long-coveted summons. And what stirring times followed! The  period of preparation was one of constant delight to us children. We  were four--my two sisters, one brother and myself. Our playmates looked  up to us in respectful admiration; neighbors, if they made no direct  investigations, bribed us with nice things for information as to what  was going into every box, package and basket. And the house was  dismantled--people came and carried off the furniture; closets, sheds  and other nooks were emptied of their contents; the great wood-pile was  taken away until only a few logs remained; ancient treasures such as  women are so loath to part with, and which mother had carried with her  from a dear little house whence poverty had driven us, were brought to  light from their hiding places, and sacrificed at the altar whose flames  were consuming so much that was fraught with precious association and  endeared by family tradition; the number of bundles and boxes increased  daily, and our home vanished hourly; the rooms became quite  uninhabitable at last, and we children glanced in glee, to the anger of  the echoes, when we heard that in the evening we were to start upon our  journey.    But we did not go till the next morning, and then as secretly as  possible. For, despite the glowing tales concerning America, people  flocked to the departure of emigrants much as they did to a funeral; to  weep and lament while (in the former case only, I believe) they envied.  As everybody in Plotzk knew us, and as the departure of a whole family  was very rousing, we dared not brave the sympathetic presence of the  whole township, that we knew we might expect. So we gave out a false  alarm.    Even then there was half the population of Plotzk on hand the next  morning. We were the heroes of the hour. I remember how the women  crowded around mother, charging her to deliver messages to their  relatives in America; how they made the air ring with their  unintelligible chorus; how they showered down upon us scores of  suggestions and admonitions; how they made us frantic with their  sympathetic weeping and wringing of hands; how, finally, the ringing of  the signal bell set them all talking faster and louder than ever, in  desperate efforts to give the last bits of advice, deliver the last  messages, and, to their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#1)"],[1,"SCOTLAND***              Transcribed from the 1775 edition with the corrections noted in the 1785  errata by David Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk            A JOURNEY TO THE WESTERN ISLANDS OF SCOTLAND      INCH KEITH      I had desired to visit the Hebrides, or Western Islands of Scotland, so  long, that I scarcely remember how the wish was originally excited; and  was in the Autumn of the year 1773 induced to undertake the journey, by  finding in Mr. Boswell a companion, whose acuteness would help my  inquiry, and whose gaiety of conversation and civility of manners are  sufficient to counteract the inconveniences of travel, in countries less  hospitable than we have passed.    On the eighteenth of August we left Edinburgh, a city too well known to  admit description, and directed our course northward, along the eastern  coast of Scotland, accompanied the first day by another gentleman, who  could stay with us only long enough to shew us how much we lost at  separation.    As we crossed the Frith of Forth, our curiosity was attracted by Inch  Keith, a small island, which neither of my companions had ever visited,  though, lying within their view, it had all their lives solicited their  notice.  Here, by climbing with some difficulty over shattered crags, we  made the first experiment of unfrequented coasts.  Inch Keith is nothing  more than a rock covered with a thin layer of earth, not wholly bare of  grass, and very fertile of thistles.  A small herd of cows grazes  annually upon it in the summer.  It seems never to have afforded to man  or beast a permanent habitation.    We found only the ruins of a small fort, not so injured by time but that  it might be easily restored to its former state.  It seems never to have  been intended as a place of strength, nor was built to endure a siege,  but merely to afford cover to a few soldiers, who perhaps had the charge  of a battery, or were stationed to give signals of approaching danger.  There is therefore no provision of water within the walls, though the  spring is so near, that it might have been easily enclosed.  One of the  stones had this inscription: 'Maria Reg. 1564.'  It has probably been  neglected from the time that the whole island had the same king.    We left this little island with our thoughts employed awhile on the  different appearance that it would have made, if it had been placed at  the same distance from London, with the same facility of approach; with  what emulation of price a few rocky acres would have been purchased, and  with what expensive industry they would have been cultivated and adorned.    When we landed, we found our chaise ready, and passed through Kinghorn,  Kirkaldy, and Cowpar, places not unlike the small or straggling market-  towns in those parts of England where commerce and manufactures have not  yet produced opulence.    Though we were yet in the most populous part of Scotland, and at so small  a distance from the capital, we met few passengers.    The roads are neither rough nor dirty; and it affords a southern stranger  a new kind of pleasure to travel so commodiously without the interruption  of toll-gates.  Where the bottom is rocky, as it seems commonly to be in  Scotland, a smooth way is made indeed with great labour, but it never  wants repairs; and in those parts where adventitious materials are  necessary, the ground once consolidated is rarely broken; for the inland  commerce is not great, nor are heavy commodities often transported  otherwise than by water.  The carriages in common use are small carts,  drawn each by one little horse; and a man seems to derive some degree of  dignity and importance from the reputation of possessing a two-horse  cart.          ST. ANDREWS      At an hour somewhat late we came to St. Andrews, a city once  archiepiscopal; where that university still subsists in which philosophy  was formerly taught by Buchanan, whose name has as fair a claim to  immortality as can be conferred by modern latinity, and perhaps a fairer  than the instability of vernacular languages admits.    We found, that by the interposition of some invisible friend, lodgings  had been provided for us at the house of one of the professors, whose  easy civility quickly made us forget that we were strangers; and in the  whole time of our stay we were gratified by every mode of kindness, and  entertained with all the elegance of lettered hospitality.    In the morning we rose to perambulate a city, which only history shews to  have once flourished, and surveyed the ruins of ancient magnificence, of  which even the ruins cannot long be visible, unless some care be taken to  preserve them; and where is the pleasure of preserving such mournful  memorials?  They have been till very lately so much neglected, that every  man carried away the stones who fancied that he wanted them.    The cathedral, of which the foundations may be still traced, and a small  part of the wall is standing, appears to have been a spacious and  majestick building, not unsuitable to the primacy of the kingdom.  Of the  architecture, the poor remains can hardly exhibit, even to an artist, a  sufficient specimen.  It was demolished, as is well known, in the tumult  and violence of Knox's reformation.    Not far from the cathedral, on the margin of the water, stands a fragment  of the castle, in which the archbishop anciently resided.  It was never  very large, and was built with more attention to security than pleasure.  Cardinal Beatoun is said to have had workmen employed in improving its  fortifications at the time when he was murdered by the ruffians of  reformation, in the manner of which Knox has given what he himself calls  a merry narrative.    The change of religion in Scotland, eager and vehement as it was, raised  an epidemical enthusiasm, compounded of sullen scrupulousness and warlike  ferocity, which, in a people whom idleness resigned to their own  thoughts, and who, conversing only with each other, suffered no dilution  of their zeal from the gradual influx of new opinions, was long  transmitted in its full strength from the old to the young, but by trade  and intercourse with England, is now visibly abating, and giving way too  fast to that laxity of practice and indifference of opinion, in which  men, not sufficiently instructed to find the middle point, too easily  shelter themselves from rigour and constraint.    The city of St. Andrews, when it had lost its archiepiscopal  pre-eminence, gradually decayed: One of its streets is now lost; and in  those that remain, there is silence and solitude of inactive indigence  and gloomy depopulation.    The university, within a few years, consisted of three colleges, but is  now reduced to two; the college of St. Leonard being lately dissolved by  the sale of its buildings and the appropriation of its revenues to the  professors of the two others.  The chapel of the alienated college is yet  standing, a fabrick not inelegant of external structure; but I was  always, by some civil excuse, hindred from entering it.  A decent  attempt, as I was since told, has been made to convert it into a kind of  green-house, by planting its area with shrubs.  This new method of  gardening is unsuccessful; the plants do not hitherto prosper.  To what  use it will next be put I have no pleasure in conjecturing.  It is  something that its present state is at least not ostentatiously  displayed.  Where there is yet shame, there may in time be virtue.    The dissolution of St. Leonard's college was doubtless necessary; but of  that necessity there is reason to complain.  It is surely not without  just reproach, that a nation, of which the commerce is hourly extending,  and the wealth encreasing, denies any participation of its prosperity to  its literary societies; and while its merchants or its nobles are raising  palaces, suffers its universities to moulder into dust.    Of the two colleges yet standing, one is by the institution of its  founder appropriated to Divinity.  It is said to be capable of containing  fifty students; but more than one must occupy a chamber.  The library,  which is of late erection, is not very spacious, but elegant and  luminous.    The doctor, by whom it was shewn, hoped to irritate or subdue my English  vanity by telling me, that we had no such repository of books in England.    Saint Andrews seems to be a place eminently adapted to study and  education, being situated in a populous, yet a cheap country, and  exposing the minds and manners of young men neither to the levity and  dissoluteness of a capital city, nor to the gross luxury of a town of  commerce, places naturally unpropitious to learning; in one the desire of  knowledge easily gives way to the love of pleasure, and in the other, is  in danger of yielding to the love of money.    The students however are represented as at this time not exceeding a  hundred.  Perhaps it may be some obstruction to their increase that there  is no episcopal chapel in the place.  I saw no reason for imputing their  paucity to the present professors; nor can the expence of an academical  education be very reasonably objected.  A student of the highest class  may keep his annual session, or as the English call it, his term, which  lasts seven months, for about fifteen pounds, and one of lower rank for  less than ten; in which board, lodging, and instruction are all included.    The chief magistrate resident in the university, answering to our vice-  chancellor, and to the _rector magnificus_ on the continent, had commonly  the title of Lord Rector; but being addressed only as Mr. Rector in an  inauguratory speech by the present chancellor, he has fallen from his  former dignity of style.  Lordship was very liberally annexed by our  ancestors to any station or character of dignity: They said, the Lord  General, and Lord Ambassador; so we still say, my Lord, to the judge upon  the circuit, and yet retain in our Liturgy the Lords of"]]]
