Well, we cannot book further than Warsaw for Russia.\"    \"Warsaw will do. . . . . How much? . . . Thank you.\"    My baggage having next been duly registered direct for the capital of  Poland, off I set to Queenborough, crossed over by the night boat to  Flushing, and continued the following morning by express to Berlin.    Once in the Russian train from the German capital one hears a great deal  of the terrors of the approaching Russian Custom-house, and here I may  relate rather an amusing incident which will prove what these terrors  amount to. In my sleeping car there happened to be some French merchants  on their way to the fair of Nijni-Novgorod. On perceiving my two rifles,  a good-sized ammunition case, and two cameras, one of the gentlemen  gratuitously informed me that if I intended to proceed to Russia I had  better leave all these things behind, or they would all be confiscated at  the frontier. I begged to differ, and the Frenchmen laughed boisterously  at my ignorance, and at what would happen presently. In their imaginative  minds they perceived my valued firearms being lost for ever, and  predicted my being detained at the police station till it pleased _les  terribles Cossacques_ to let me proceed.    \"Evidently,\" shouted one of the Frenchmen at the top of his voice, \"this  is your first journey abroad. . . . _We_,\" he added, \"are great  travellers. We have been once before in Russia.\"    \"You _are_ great travellers!\" I exclaimed, with the emphasis very strong  on the _are_, and pretending intense admiration.    Naturally the Franco-Russian Alliance was dragged into the conversation;  were I a Frenchman I might fare less badly. The Russians and the French  were brothers. But a British subject! A hated Englishman bringing into  Russia two rifles, two revolvers, six hundred cartridges, twelve hundred  photographic plates, two cameras, a large case of scientific instruments,  all of which I would duly declare! Why? Russia was not England. I should  soon experience how Englishmen were treated in some countries.  \"Russians,\" he exclaimed, \"have not a polished manner like the French.  _Ah, non!_ They are semi-barbarians yet. They respect and fear the  French, but not the English. . . . _par exemple!_\"    The frontier station of Alexandrovo was reached, and a horde of  terror-stricken passengers alighted from the carriages, preceded and  followed by bags, portmanteaux, hold-alls, and bundles of umbrellas,  which were hastily conveyed to the long tables of the huge Custom-house  inspection room.    The two Frenchmen had their belongings next to mine on the long counter,  and presently an officer came. They were French subjects and they had  nothing to declare. Their elaborately decorated bags were instantly  ordered open and turned upside down, while the officer searched with some  gusto among the contents now spread on the table. There was a small  pocket camera, two packets of photographic plates, some soiled  handkerchiefs, collars and cuffs, a box of fancy note-paper, a bottle of  scent, a pair of embroidered pantoufles, and a lot of patent brass studs  and cuff links.    With the exception of the soiled linen, everything was seized, for all  were liable to duty, and some sharp words of reprimand were used by the  officer to my now subdued French neighbours for attempting to smuggle.    The officer moved on to me.    \"Monsieur,\" mournfully remarked the Frenchman, \"now _you_ will be done  for.\"    I declared everything and produced a special permit, which had been very  courteously given me by the Russian Ambassador, and handed it to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustration.

The indices of this second edition have been carefully revised, and a  considerable number of additions have been made to the lists.    The author begs once more to call attention to the fact that, with one  or two exceptions, _he has mentioned no pictures that he has not seen_.  The lists are the result, not of compilation, but of first-hand  acquaintance with the works of art.          NOTE TO THIRD EDITION.      In this edition changes have been made in the numbering of the Venice  and Vienna Galleries, as well as of some minor collections, to  correspond to recent rehanging. Many other alterations have been  required by the breaking up of private collections. In several instances  it has been impossible to trace pictures to their new homes, and of such  the more important remain under the names of their former owners. To the  lists of painters have been added Beccaruzzi, Caprioli, Polidoro  Lanzani, Rocco Marconi, Andrea Schiavone, and Girolamo da Treviso,  artists important enough to be missed, but of merit so unequal that only  their more interesting works are here given. But the bulk of new  additions, amounting to a third as much again as was comprised in the  last edition, is of pictures in the various provincial galleries and  private collections of Great Britain, France, and Germany.    The author takes great pleasure in acknowledging his indebtedness to Mr.  Herbert F. Cook for invaluable aid in visiting some of the almost  numberless British collections.          PREFACE.      The following essay owes its origin to the author's belief that Venetian  painting is the most complete expression in art of the Italian  Renaissance. The Renaissance is even more important typically than  historically. Historically it may be looked upon as an age of glory or  of shame according to the different views entertained of European events  during the past five centuries. But typically it stands for youth, and  youth alone--for intellectual curiosity and energy grasping at the whole  of life as material which it hopes to mould to any shape.    Every generation has an innate sympathy with some epoch of the past  wherein it seems to find itself foreshadowed. Science has of late  revealed and given much, but its revelation and gifts are as nothing to  the promise it holds out of constant acquisition and perpetual growth,  of everlasting youth. We ourselves, because of our faith in science and  the power of work, are instinctively in sympathy with the Renaissance.  Our problems do not seem so easy to solve, our tasks are more difficult  because our vision is wider, but the spirit which animates us was  anticipated by the spirit of the Renaissance, and more than anticipated.  That spirit seems like the small rough model after which ours is being  fashioned.    Italian painting interests many of us more than the painting of any  other school not because of its essential superiority, but because it  expressed the Renaissance; and Venetian painting is interesting above  all because it was at Venice alone that this expression attained  perfection. Elsewhere, particularly in Florence, it died away before it  found complete utterance.    In order to keep the main idea clearly before the mind of the reader, to  show him how the Renaissance reveals itself in Venetian painting, the  introduction of anything not strictly relevant to the subject has been  avoided. The salient points once perceived and connected with the more  important painters, the reader will find no difficulty in seeing the  proper place of any given work by a great master, or the relative  importance of those second-and third-rate painters of whom no special  mention has been made because they are comprised within what has been  said about the greater artists.    But happily art is too great and too vital a subject to be crowded into  any single formula; and a formula that would, without distorting our  entire view of Italian art in the fifteenth century, do full justice to  such a painter as Carlo Crivelli, does not exist. He takes rank with the  most genuine artists of all times and countries, and does not weary even  when \"great masters\" grow tedious. He expresses with the freedom and  spirit of Japanese design a piety as wild and tender as Jacopo da  Todi's, a sweetness of emotion as sincere and dainty as of a Virgin and  Child carved in ivory by a French craftsman of the fourteenth century.  The mystic beauty of Simone Martini, the agonized compassion of the  young Bellini, are embodied by Crivelli in forms which have the strength  of line and the metallic lustre of old Satsuma or lacquer, and which are  no less tempting to the touch. Crivelli must be treated by himself and  as the product of stationary, if not reactionary, conditions. Having  lived most of his life far away from the main currents of culture, in a  province where St. Bernardino had been spending his last energies in the  endeavour to call the world back to the ideals of an infantile  civilisation, Crivelli does not belong to a movement of constant  progress, and therefore is not within the scope of this work.    To make the essay useful as a handbook to Venetian painting, lists have  been appended of the works, in and out of Italy, by the principal  Venetian masters. These lists do not pretend to absolute completeness.  Only such private collections have been mentioned as are well known and  accessible to students, although in the case of very rare painters all  of their known works are given, and even such as are of doubtful  authenticity are alluded to. The author has seen and carefully  considered all the pictures he mentions, except one or two at St.  Petersburg, which are, however, well known from the photographs of MM.  Braun & Cie. The attributions are based on the results of the most  recent research. Even such painstaking critics of some years ago as  Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle laboured under terrible disadvantages,  because most of their work was done at a time when travelling was much  slower than it has now become, and when photography was not sufficiently  perfected to be of great service. Rapid transit and isochromatic  photography are beginning to enable the student to make of  connoisseurship something like an exact science. To a certain extent,  therefore, Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle have been superseded, and to a  great degree supplemented by the various writings of Morelli, Richter,  Frizzoni, and others. The author takes pleasure in acknowledging his  indebtedness to the first systematic writers on Italian painting no less  than to the perfectors of the new critical method, now adopted by nearly  all serious students of Italian art. To the founder of the new  criticism, the late Giovanni Morelli, and to his able successor, Dr.  Gustavo Frizzoni, the author feels bound to ascribe many of his  attributions, although a number are based on independent research, and  for these he alone is responsible. Special thanks are due to a dear  friend, Enrico Costa, for placing his notes of a recent visit to Madrid  at the author's disposal. They have been used, with a confidence  warranted by Signor Costa's unrivalled connoisseurship, to supplement  the author's own notes, taken some years ago.    Having noted the dependence of scientific art study upon isochromatic  photography, the author is happy to take this opportunity of expressing  his gratitude to such able photographers as Loewy of Vienna, Tamme of  Dresden, Marcozzi of Milan, Alinari Bros. of Florence, and Dominic  Anderson of Rome, all of whom have devoted themselves with special zeal  to the paintings of the Venetian masters. The author is peculiarly  indebted to Signor Anderson for having materially assisted his studies  by photographing many pictures which at present have a scientific rather  than a popular interest.    The frontispiece is a reproduction of Giorgione's \"Shepherd\" at Hampton  Court, a picture which perhaps better than any other expresses the  Renaissance at the most fascinating point of its course. The author is  indebted to Mr. Sidney Colvin for permission to make use of a photograph  taken at his order.          CONTENTS.      THE VENETIAN PAINTERS OF THE RENAISSANCE    I.
