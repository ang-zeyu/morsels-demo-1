Transcriber's Comments on the preparation of this E-Text:    SQUARE BRACKETS:    The square brackets, i.e. [ ] are copied from the printed book, without  change, except that a closing bracket \"]\" has been added to the stage  directions.      FOOTNOTES:    For this E-Text version of the book, the footnotes have been  consolidated at the end of the play.    Numbering of the footnotes has been changed, and each footnote is given  a unique identity in the form <X>.      CHANGES TO THE TEXT:    Character names have been expanded. For Example, SIR BENJAMIN was SIR  BEN.          THE TEXT OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL    The text of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL in this edition is taken, by Mr.  Fraser Rae's generous permission, from his SHERIDAN'S PLAYS NOW PRINTED  AS HE WROTE THEM. In his Prefatory Notes (xxxvii), Mr. Rae writes: \"The  manuscript of it [THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL] in Sheridan's own handwriting  is preserved at Frampton Court and is now printed in this volume. This  version differs in many respects from that which is generally known,  and I think it is even better than that which has hitherto been read and  acted. As I have endeavoured to reproduce the works of Sheridan as he  wrote them, I may be told that he was a bad hand at punctuating and very  bad at spelling. . . . But Sheridan's shortcomings as a speller have  been exaggerated.\" Lest \"Sheridan's shortcomings\" either in spelling  or in punctuation should obscure the text, I have, in this edition,  inserted in brackets some explanatory suggestions. It has seemed best,  also, to adopt a uniform method for indicating stage-directions and  abbreviations of the names of characters. There can be no gain to the  reader in reproducing, for example, Sheridan's different indications for  the part of Lady Sneerwell--LADY SNEERWELL, LADY SNEER., LADY SN., and  LADY S.--or his varying use of EXIT and EX., or his inconsistencies in  the use of italics in the stage-directions. Since, however, Sheridan's  biographers, from Moore to Fraser Rae, have shown that no authorised or  correct edition of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL was published in Sheridan's  lifetime, there seems unusual justification for reproducing the text of  the play itself with absolute fidelity to the original manuscript. Mr.  Ridgway, who repeatedly sought to obtain a copy corrected by the author,  according to Moore's account (LIFE OF SHERIDAN, I. p. 260), \"was told  by Mr. Sheridan, as an excuse for keeping it back, that he had been  nineteen years endeavouring to satisfy himself with the style of The  School for Scandal, but had not yet succeeded.\" Mr. Rae (SHERIDAN, I. p.  332) recorded his discovery of the manuscript of \"two acts of The School  for Scandal prepared by Sheridan for publication,\" and hoped, before his  death, to publish this partial revision. Numberless unauthorized changes  in the play have been made for histrionic purposes, from the first  undated Dublin edition to that of Mr. Augustin Daly. Current texts may  usually be traced, directly or indirectly, to the two-volume Murray  edition of Sheridan's plays, in 1821. Some of the changes from the  original manuscript, such as the blending of the parts of Miss Verjuice  and Snake, are doubtless effective for reasons of dramatic economy, but  many of the \"cuts\" are to be regretted from the reader's standpoint. The  student of English drama will prefer Sheridan's own text to editorial  emendations, however clever or effective for dramatic ends.            THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL      ADDRESSED TO MRS. CREWE,    WITH THE COMEDY OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL         Tell me, ye prim adepts in Scandal's school,       Who rail by precept, and detract by rule,       Lives there no character, so tried, so known,       So deck'd with grace, and so unlike your own,       That even you assist her fame to raise,       Approve by envy, and by silence praise!--       Attend!--a model shall attract your view--       Daughters of calumny, I summon you!       You shall decide if this a portrait prove,       Or fond creation of the Muse and Love.--       Attend, ye virgin critics, shrewd and sage,       Ye matron censors of this childish age,       Whose peering eye and wrinkled front declare       A fixt antipathy to young and fair;       By cunning, cautious; or by nature, cold,       In maiden madness, virulently bold!--       Attend! ye skilled to coin the precious tale,       Creating proof, where innuendos fail!       Whose practised memories, cruelly exact,       Omit no circumstance, except the fact!--       Attend, all ye who boast,--or old or young,--       The living libel of a slanderous tongue!       So shall my theme as far contrasted be,       As saints by fiends, or hymns by calumny.       Come, gentle Amoret (for 'neath that name,       In worthier verse is sung thy beauty's fame);       Come--for but thee who seeks the Muse? and while       Celestial blushes check thy conscious smile,       With timid grace, and hesitating eye,       The perfect model, which I boast, supply:--       Vain Muse! couldst thou the humblest sketch create       Of her, or slightest charm couldst imitate--       Could thy blest strain in kindred colours trace       The faintest wonder of her form and face--       Poets would study the immortal line,       And REYNOLDS own HIS art subdued by thine;       That art, which well might added lustre give       To Nature's best and Heaven's superlative:       On GRANBY'S cheek might bid new glories rise,       Or point a purer beam from DEVON'S eyes!       Hard is the task to shape that beauty's praise,       Whose judgment scorns the homage flattery pays!       But praising Amoret we cannot err,       No tongue o'ervalues Heaven, or flatters her!       Yet she, by Fate's perverseness--she alone       Would doubt our truth, nor deem such praise her own!       Adorning Fashion, unadorn'd by dress,       Simple from taste, and not from carelessness;       Discreet in gesture, in deportment mild,       Not stiff with prudence, nor uncouthly wild:       No state has AMORET! no studied mien;       She frowns no GODDESS, and she moves no QUEEN.       The softer charm that in her manner lies       Is framed to captivate, yet not surprise;       It justly suits th' expression of her face,--       'Tis less than dignity, and more than grace!       On her pure cheek the native hue is such,       That, form'd by Heav'n to be admired so much,       The hand divine, with a less partial care,       Might well have fix'd a fainter crimson there,       And bade the gentle inmate of her breast,--       Inshrined Modesty!--supply the rest.       But who the peril of her lips shall paint?       Strip them of smiles--still, still all words are faint!       But moving Love himself appears to teach       Their action, though denied to rule her speech;       And thou who seest her speak and dost not hear,       Mourn not her distant accents 'scape thine ear;       Viewing those lips, thou still may'st make pretence       To judge of what she says, and swear 'tis sense:       Cloth'd with such grace, with such expression fraught,       They move in meaning, and they pause in thought!       But dost thou farther watch, with charm'd surprise,       The mild irresolution of her eyes,       Curious to mark how frequent they repose,       In brief eclipse and momentary close--       Ah! seest thou not an ambush'd Cupid there,       Too tim'rous of his charge, with jealous care       Veils and unveils those beams of heav'nly light,       Too full, too fatal else, for mortal sight?       Nor yet, such pleasing vengeance fond to meet,       In pard'ning dimples hope a safe retreat.       What though her peaceful breast should ne'er allow       Subduing frowns to arm her altered brow,       By Love, I swear, and by his gentle wiles,       More fatal still the mercy of her smiles!       Thus lovely, thus adorn'd, possessing all       Of bright or fair that can to woman fall,       The height of vanity might well be thought       Prerogative in her, and Nature's fault.       Yet gentle AMORET, in mind supreme       As well as charms, rejects the vainer theme;       And, half mistrustful of her beauty's store,       She barbs with wit those darts too keen before:--       Read in all knowledge that her sex should reach,       Though GREVILLE, or the MUSE, should deign to teach,       Fond to improve, nor tim'rous to discern       How far it is a woman's grace to learn;       In MILLAR'S dialect she would not prove       Apollo's priestess, but Apollo's love,       Graced by those signs which truth delights to own,       The timid blush, and mild submitted tone:       Whate'er she says, though sense appear throughout,       Displays the tender hue of female doubt;       Deck'd with that charm, how lovely wit appears,       How graceful SCIENCE, when that robe she wears!       Such too her talents, and her bent of mind,       As speak a sprightly heart by thought refined:       A taste for mirth, by contemplation school'd,       A turn for ridicule, by candour ruled,       A scorn of folly, which she tries to hide;       An awe of talent, which she owns with pride!         Peace, idle Muse! no more thy strain prolong,       But yield a theme thy warmest praises wrong;       Just to her merit, though thou canst not raise       Thy feeble verse, behold th' acknowledged praise       Has spread conviction through the envious train,       And cast a fatal gloom o'er Scandal's reign!       And lo! each pallid hag, with blister'd tongue,       Mutters assent to all thy zeal has sung--       Owns all the colours just--the outline true;       Thee my inspirer, and my MODEL--CREWE!

FOREL(1)          [Pages 6-10]      O revered personage, lover of truth! Thy letter dated 28 July 1921(2) hath  been received. The contents thereof were most pleasing and indicated that,  praised be the Lord, thou art as yet young, and searchest after truth,  that thy power of thought is strong and the discoveries of thy mind  manifest.    Numerous copies of the epistle I had written to Dr. F. are spread far and  wide and every one knoweth that it hath been revealed in the year 1910.  Apart from this, numerous epistles have been written before the war upon  the same theme, and reference, too, hath been made to these questions in  the Journal of the San Francisco University, the date whereof is known  beyond any doubt.(3) In like manner have the philosophers of broad vision  praised highly the discourse eloquently delivered in the above-named  University.(4) A copy of that paper is thus enclosed and forwarded. Thy  works are no doubt of great benefit, and if published, send us a copy of  each.    By materialists, whose belief with regard to Divinity hath been explained,  is not meant philosophers in general, but rather that group of  materialists of narrow vision who worship that which is sensed, who depend  upon the five senses only, and whose criterion of knowledge is limited to  that which can be perceived by the senses. All that can be sensed is to  them real, whilst whatever falleth not under the power of the senses is  either unreal or doubtful. The existence of the Deity they regard as  wholly doubtful.    It is as thou hast written, not philosophers in general but narrow-minded  materialists that are meant. As to deistic philosophers, such as Socrates,  Plato and Aristotle, they are indeed worthy of esteem and of the highest  praise, for they have rendered distinguished services to mankind. In like  manner we regard the materialistic, accomplished, moderate philosophers,  who have been of service (to mankind).    We regard knowledge and wisdom as the foundation of the progress of  mankind, and extol philosophers who are endowed with broad vision. Peruse  carefully the San Francisco University Journal that the truth may be  revealed to thee.    Now concerning mental faculties, they are in truth of the inherent  properties of the soul, even as the radiation of light is the essential  property of the sun. The rays of the sun are renewed but the sun itself is  ever the same and unchanged. Consider how the human intellect develops and  weakens, and may at times come to naught, whereas the soul changeth not.  For the mind to manifest itself, the human body must be whole; and a sound  mind cannot be but in a sound body, whereas the soul dependeth not upon  the body. It is through the power of the soul that the mind comprehendeth,  imagineth and exerteth its influence, whilst the soul is a power that is  free. The mind comprehendeth the abstract by the aid of the concrete, but  the soul hath limitless manifestations of its own. The mind is  circumscribed, the soul limitless. It is by the aid of such senses as  those of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, that the mind  comprehendeth, whereas the soul is free from all agencies. The soul as  thou observest, whether it be in sleep or waking, is in motion and ever  active. Possibly it may, whilst in a dream, unravel an intricate problem,  incapable of solution in the waking state. The mind, moreover,  understandeth not whilst the senses have ceased to function, and in the  embryonic stage and in early infancy the reasoning power is totally  absent, whereas the soul is ever endowed with full strength. In short, the  proofs are many that go to show that despite the loss of reason, the power  of the soul would still continue to exist. The spirit however possesseth  various grades and stations.    As to the existence of spirit in the mineral: it is indubitable that  minerals are endowed with a spirit and life according to the requirements  of that stage. This unknown secret, too, hath become known unto the  materialists who now maintain that all beings are endowed with life, even  as He saith in the Qur'an, 'All things are living'.    In the vegetable world, too, there is the power of growth, and that power  of growth is the spirit. In the animal world there is the sense of  feeling, but in the human world there is an all-embracing power. In all  the preceding stages the power of reason is absent, but the soul existeth  and revealeth itself. The sense of feeling understandeth not the soul,  whereas the reasoning power of the mind proveth the existence thereof.    In like manner the mind proveth the existence of an unseen Reality that  embraceth all beings, and that existeth and revealeth itself in all  stages, the essence whereof is beyond the grasp of the mind. Thus the  mineral world understandeth neither the nature nor the perfections of the  vegetable world; the vegetable world understandeth not the nature of the  animal world, neither the animal world the nature of the reality of man  that discovereth and embraceth all things.    The animal is the captive of nature and cannot transgress the rules and  laws thereof. In man, however, there is a discovering power that  transcendeth the world of nature and controlleth and interfereth with the  laws thereof. For instance, all minerals, plants and animals are captives  of nature. The sun itself with all its majesty is so subservient to nature  that it hath no will of its own and cannot deviate a hair's-breadth from  the laws thereof. In like manner all other beings, whether of the mineral,  the vegetable or the animal world, cannot deviate from the laws of nature,  nay, all are the slaves thereof. Man, however, though in body the captive  of nature is yet free in his mind and soul, and hath the mastery over  nature.    Consider: according to the law of nature man liveth, moveth and hath his  being on earth, yet his soul and mind interfere with the laws thereof, and          [Pages 11-20]      even as the bird he flieth in the air, saileth speedily upon the seas and  as the fish soundeth the deep and discovereth the things therein. Verily  this is a grievous defeat inflicted upon the laws of nature.    So is the power of electrical energy: this unruly violent force that  cleaveth mountains is yet imprisoned by man within a globe! This is  manifestly interfering with the laws of nature. Likewise man discovereth  those hidden secrets of nature that in conformity with the laws thereof  must remain concealed, and transfereth them from the invisible plane to  the visible. This, too, is interfering with the law of nature. In the same  manner he discovereth the inherent properties of things that are the  secrets of nature. Also he bringeth to light the past events that have  been lost to memory, and foreseeth by his power of induction future  happenings that are as yet unknown. Furthermore, communication and  discovery are limited by the laws of nature to short distances, whereas  man, through that inner power of his that discovereth the reality of all  things, connecteth the East with the West. This, too, is interfering with  the laws of nature. Similarly, according to the law of nature all shadows  are fleeting, whereas man fixeth them upon the plate, and this, too, is  interference with a law of nature. Ponder and reflect: all sciences, arts,  crafts, inventions and discoveries, have been once the secrets of nature  and in conformity with the laws thereof must remain hidden; yet man  through his discovering power interfereth with the laws of nature and  transfereth these hidden secrets from the invisible to the visible plane.  This again is interfering with the laws of nature.    In fine, that inner faculty in man, unseen of the eye, wresteth the sword  from the hands of nature, and giveth it a grievous blow. All other beings,  however great, are bereft of such perfections. Man hath the powers of will  and understanding, but nature hath them not. Nature is constrained, man is  free. Nature is bereft of understanding, man understandeth. Nature is  unaware of past events, but man is aware of them. Nature forecasteth not  the future; man by his discerning power seeth that which is to come.  Nature hath no consciousness of itself, man knoweth about all things.    Should any one suppose that man is but a part of the world of nature, and  he being endowed with these perfections, these being but manifestations of  the world of nature, and thus nature is the originator of these  perfections and is not deprived therefrom, to him we make reply and say:  the part dependeth upon the whole; the"]]]
