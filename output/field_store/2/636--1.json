I.    A French writer has recently published a careful and interesting volume  on the famous events which ended in the overthrow of Robespierre and the  close of the Reign of Terror.[1] These events are known in the historic  calendar as the Revolution of Thermidor in the Year II. After the fall  of the monarchy, the Convention decided that the year should begin with  the autumnal equinox, and that the enumeration should date from the  birth of the Republic. The Year I. opens on September 22, 1792; the Year  II. opens on the same day of 1793. The month of Thermidor begins on July  19. The memorable Ninth Thermidor therefore corresponds to July 27,  1794. This has commonly been taken as the date of the commencement of a  counter-revolution, and in one sense it was so. Comte, however, and  others have preferred to fix the reaction at the execution of Danton  (April 5, 1794), or Robespierre's official proclamation of Deism in the  Festival of the Supreme Being (May 7, 1794).    [Footnote 1: _La Revolution de Thermidor_. Par Ch. D'Hericault. Paris:  Didier, 1876.]    M. D'Hericault does not belong to the school of writers who treat the  course of history as a great high road, following a firmly traced line,  and set with plain and ineffaceable landmarks. The French Revolution has  nearly always been handled in this way, alike by those who think it  fruitful in blessings, and by their adversaries, who pronounce it a  curse inflicted by the wrath of Heaven. Historians have looked at the  Revolution as a plain landsman looks at the sea. To the landsman the  ocean seems one huge immeasurable flood, obeying a simple law of ebb and  flow, and offering to the navigator a single uniform force. Yet in truth  we know that the oceanic movement is the product of many forces; the  seeming uniformity covers the energy of a hundred currents and  counter-currents; the sea-floor is not even nor the same, but is subject  to untold conditions of elevation and subsidence; the sea is not one  mass, but many masses moving along definite lines of their own. It is  the same with the great tides of history. Wise men shrink from summing  them up in single propositions. That the French Revolution led to an  immense augmentation of happiness, both for the French and for mankind,  can only be denied by the Pope. That it secured its beneficent results  untempered by any mixture of evil, can only be maintained by men as mad  as Doctor Pangloss. The Greek poetess Corinna said to the youthful  Pindar, when he had interwoven all the gods and goddesses in the Theban  mythology into a single hymn, that we should sow with the hand and not  with the sack. Corinna's monition to the singer is proper to the  interpreter of historical truth: he should cull with the hand, and not  sweep in with the scythe. It is doubtless mere pedantry to abstain from  the widest conception of the sum of a great movement. A clear, definite,  and stable idea of the meaning in the history of human progress of such  vast groups of events as the Reformation or the Revolution, is  indispensable for any one to whom history is a serious study of society.  It is just as important, however, not to forget that they were really  groups of events, and not in either case a single uniform movement. The  World-Epos is after all only a file of the morning paper in a state of  glorification. A sensible man learns, in everyday life, to abstain from  praising and blaming character by wholesale; he becomes content to say  of this trait that it is good, and of that act that it was bad. So in  history, we become unwilling to join or to admire those who insist upon  transferring their sentiment upon the whole to their judgment upon each  part. We seek to be allowed to retain a decided opinion as to the final  value to mankind of a long series of transactions, and yet not to commit  ourselves to set the same estimate on each transaction in particular,  still less on each person associated with it. Why shall we not prize the  general results of the Reformation, without being obliged to defend John  of Leyden and the Munster Anabaptists?    M. D'Hericault's volume naturally suggests such reflections as these. Of  all the men of the Revolution, Robespierre has suffered most from the  audacious idolatry of some writers, and the splenetic impatience of  others. M. Louis Blanc and M. Ernest Hamel talk of him as an angel or a  prophet, and the Ninth Thermidor is a red day indeed in their  martyrology. Michelet and M. D'Hericault treat him as a mixture of  Cagliostro and Caligula, both a charlatan and a miscreant. We are  reminded of the commencement of an address of the French Senate to the  first Bonaparte: 'Sire,' they began, 'the desire for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                    [Illustration: _Adventures of Tom Thumb_  It Shone Down Upon the White Pebbles]          FAVORITE  FAIRY TALES    ARRANGED BY    LOGAN MARSHALL    [Illustration]    _ONE HUNDRED ILLUSTRATIONS_    THE JOHN C.

While  she was thus engaged and looking out at the snow she pricked her finger,  and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. Now the red looked so well  upon the white that she thought to herself, \"Oh, that I had a child as  white as this snow, as red as this blood, and as black as the wood of  this frame!\" Soon afterwards a little daughter came to her, who was as  white as snow, and with cheeks as red as blood, and with hair as black  as ebony, and from this she was named \"Snow-White.\" And at the same time  her mother died.    About a year afterwards the King married another wife, who was very  beautiful, but so proud and haughty that she could not bear anyone to be  better-looking than herself. She owned a wonderful mirror, and when she  stepped before it and said:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Who is the fairest of us all?\"    it replied:        \"The Queen is the fairest of the day.\"    Then she was pleased, for she knew that the mirror spoke truly.    Little Snow-White, however, grew up, and became prettier and prettier,  and when she was seven years old she was as fair as the noonday, and  more beautiful than the Queen herself. When the Queen now asked her  mirror:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Who is the fairest of us all?\"    it replied:        \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;       Snow-White is the fairest, now, they say.\"    This answer so angered the Queen that she became quite yellow with envy.  From that hour, whenever she saw Snow-White, her heart was hardened  against her, and she hated the little girl. Her envy and jealousy  increased so that she had no rest day or night, and she said to a  Huntsman, \"Take the child away into the forest. I will never look  upon her again. You must kill her, and bring me her heart and tongue  for a token.\"    The Huntsman listened and took the maiden away, but when he drew out his  knife to kill her, she began to cry, saying, \"Ah, dear Huntsman, give me  my life! I will run into the wild forest, and never come home again.\"    This speech softened the Hunter's heart, and her beauty so touched him  that he had pity on her and said, \"Well, run away then, poor child.\" But  he thought to himself, \"The wild beasts will soon devour you.\" Still he  felt as if a stone had been lifted from his heart, because her death was  not by his hand. Just at that moment a young boar came roaring along to  the spot, and as soon as he clapped eyes upon it the Huntsman caught it,  and, killing it, took its tongue and heart and carried them to the  Queen, for a token of his deed.    But now poor little Snow-White was left motherless and alone, and  overcome with grief, she was bewildered at the sight of so many trees,  and knew not which way to turn. She ran till her feet refused to go  farther, and as it was getting dark, and she saw a little house near,  she entered in to rest. In this cottage everything was very small, but  very neat and elegant. In the middle stood a little table with a white  cloth over it, and seven little plates upon it, each plate having a  spoon and a knife and a fork, and there were also seven little mugs.  Against the wall were seven little beds arranged in a row, each covered  with snow-white sheets.    Little Snow-White, being both hungry and thirsty, ate a little morsel of  porridge out of each plate, and drank a drop or two of wine out of each  mug, for she did not wish to take away the whole share of anyone. After  that, because she was so tired, she laid herself down on one bed, but it  did not suit; she tried another, but that was too long; a fourth was too  short, a fifth too hard. But the seventh was just the thing; and  tucking herself up in it, she went to sleep, first saying her prayers  as usual.    When it became quite dark the owners of the cottage came home, seven  Dwarfs, who dug for gold and silver in the mountains. They first  lighted seven little lamps, and saw at once--for they lit up the whole  room--that somebody had been in, for everything was not in the order in  which they had left it.    [Illustration]    The first asked, \"Who has been sitting on my chair?\" The second, \"Who  has been eating off my plate?\" The third said, \"Who has been nibbling  at my bread?\" The fourth, \"Who has been at my porridge?\" The fifth,  \"Who has been meddling with my fork?\" The sixth grumbled out, \"Who has  been cutting with my knife?\" The seventh said, \"Who has been drinking  out of my mug?\"    Then the first, looking round, began again, \"Who has been lying on my  bed?\" he asked, for he saw that the sheets were tumbled. At these words  the others came, and looking at their beds cried out too, \"Some one has  been lying in our beds!\" But the seventh little man, running up to his,  saw Snow-White sleeping in it; so he called his companions, who shouted  with wonder and held up their seven lamps, so that the light fell upon  the little girl.    \"Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!\" said they; \"what a beauty she is!\" and they  were so much delighted that they would not awaken her, but left her to  sleep, and the seventh Dwarf, in whose bed she was, slept with each of  his fellows one hour, and so passed the night.    As soon as morning dawned Snow-White awoke, and was quite frightened  when she saw the seven little men; but they were very friendly, and  asked her what she was called.    \"My name is Snow-White,\" was her reply.    \"Why have you come into our cottage?\" they asked.    Then she told them how her stepmother would have had her killed, but the  Huntsman had spared her life, and how she had wandered about the Whole  day until at last she had found their house.    When her tale was finished the Dwarfs said, \"Will you look after our  household--be our cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit for us, and  keep everything in neat order? If so, we will keep you here, and you  shall want for nothing.\"    And Snow-White answered, \"Yes, with all my heart and will.\" And so she  remained with them, and kept their house in order.    In the morning the Dwarfs went into the mountains and searched for  silver and gold, and in the evening they came home and found their meals  ready for them. During the day the maiden was left alone, and therefore  the good Dwarfs warned her and said, \"Be careful of your stepmother, who  will soon know of your being here. So let nobody enter the cottage.\"    The Queen meanwhile, supposing that she had eaten the heart and tongue  of her stepdaughter, believed that she was now above all the most  beautiful woman in the world. One day she stepped before her mirror,  and said:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Who is the fairest of us all?\"    and it replied:        \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;       Snow-White is fairest now, they say.       The Dwarfs protect her from thy sway       Amid the forest, far away.\"    This reply surprised her, but she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.  She knew, therefore, that the Huntsman had deceived her, and that  Snow-White was still alive. So she dyed her face and clothed herself as  a pedler woman, so that no one could recognize her, and in this disguise  she went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs. She  knocked at the door of the hut, and called out, \"Fine goods for sale!  beautiful goods for sale!\"    Snow-White peeped out of the window and said, \"Good day, my good woman;  what have you to sell?\"    \"Fine goods, beautiful goods!\" she replied. \"Stays of all colors.\" And  she held up a pair which were made of many-colored silks.    \"I may let in this honest woman,\" thought Snow-White; and she unbolted  the door and bargained for one pair of stays.    \"You can't think, my dear, how they become you!\" exclaimed the old  woman. \"Come, let me lace them up for you.\"    Snow-White suspected nothing, and let her do as she wished, but the old  woman laced her up so quickly and so tightly that all her breath went,  and she fell down like one dead. \"Now,\" thought the old woman to  herself, hastening away, \"now am I once more the most beautiful of all!\"    [Illustration]    At eventide, not long after she had left, the seven Dwarfs came home,  and were much frightened at seeing their dear little maid lying on the  ground, and neither moving nor breathing, as if she were dead. They  raised her up, and when they saw that she was laced too tight they cut  the stays to pieces, and presently she began to breathe again, and  little by little she revived. When the Dwarfs now heard what had taken  place, "]]]
