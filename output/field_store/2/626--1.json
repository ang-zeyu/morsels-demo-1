INTRODUCTION      William Beckford, born in 1759, the year before the accession of King  George the Third, was the son of an Alderman who became twice Lord Mayor  of London.  His family, originally of Gloucestershire, had thriven by the  plantations in Jamaica; and his father, sent to school in England, and  forming a school friendship at Westminster with Lord Mansfield, began the  world in this country as a merchant, with inheritance of an enormous West  India fortune.  William Beckford the elder became Magistrate, Member of  Parliament, Alderman.  Four years before the birth of William Beckford  the younger he became one of the Sheriffs of London, and three years  after his son's birth he was Lord Mayor.  As Mayor he gave very sumptuous  dinners that made epochs in the lives of feeding men.  His son's famous  \"History of the Caliph Vathek\" looks as if it had been planned for an  Alderman's dream after a very heavy dinner at the Mansion House.  There  is devotion in it to the senses, emphasis on heavy dining.  Vathek piqued  himself on being the greatest eater alive; but when the Indian dined with  him, though the tables were thirty times covered, there was still want of  more food for the voracious guest.  There is thirst: for at one part of  the dream, when Vathek's mother, his wives, and some eunuchs \"assiduously  employed themselves in filling bowls of rock crystal, and emulously  presented them to him, it frequently happened that his avidity exceeded  their zeal, insomuch that he would prostrate himself upon the ground to  lap up the water, of which he could never have enough.\"  And the  nightmare incidents of the Arabian tale all culminate in a most terrible  heartburn.  Could the conception of Vathek have first come to the son  after a City dinner?    Though a magnificent host, the elder Beckford was no glutton.  In the  year of his first Mayoralty, 1763, Beckford, stood by the side of  Alderman Wilkes, attacked for his No. 45 of _The North Briton_.  As  champion of the popular cause, when he had been again elected to the  Mayoralty, Beckford, on the 23rd of May, 1770, went up to King George the  Third at the head of the Aldermen and Livery with an address which the  king snubbed with a short answer.  Beckford asked leave to reply, and  before His Majesty recovered breath from his astonishment, proceeded to  reply in words that remain graven in gold upon his monument in Guildhall.  Young Beckford, the author of \"Vathek,\" was then a boy not quite eleven  years old, an only son; and he was left three years afterwards, by his  father's death, heir to an income of a hundred thousand a year, with a  million of cash in hand.    During his minority young Beckford's mother, who was a granddaughter of  the sixth Earl of Abercorn, placed him under a private tutor.  He was  taught music by Mozart; and the Earl of Chatham, who had been his  father's friend, thought him so fanciful a boy--\"all air and fire\"--that  he advised his mother to keep the Arabian Nights out of his way.  Happily  she could not, for Vathek adds the thousand and second to the thousand  and one tales, with the difference that it joins to wild inventions in  the spirit of the East touches of playful extravagance that could come  only from an English humourist who sometimes laughed at his own tale, and  did not mind turning its comic side to the reader.  The younger William  Beckford had been born at his father's seat in Wiltshire, Fonthill Abbey;  and at seventeen amused himself with a caricature \"History of  Extraordinary Painters,\" encouraging the house-keeper of Fonthill to show  the pictures to visitors as works of Og of Basan and other worthies in  her usual edifying manner.    Young Beckford's education was continued for a year and a half at Geneva.  He then travelled in Italy and the Low Countries, and it was at this time  that he amused himself by writing, at the age of about twenty-two,  \"Vathek\" in French, at a single sitting; but he gave his mind to it and  the sitting lasted three days and two nights.  An English version of it  was made by a stranger, and published without permission in 1784.  Beckford himself published his tale at Paris and Lausanne in 1787, one  year after the death of a wife to whom he had been three years married,  and who left him with two daughters.    Beckford went to Portugal and Spain; returned to France, and was present  at the storming of the Bastille.  He was often abroad; he bought Gibbon's  library at Lausanne, and shut himself up with it for a time, having a  notion of reading it through.  He was occasionally in Parliament, but did  not care for that kind of amusement.  He wrote pieces of less enduring  interest than \"Vathek,\" including two burlesques upon the sentimental  novel of his time.  In 1796 he settled down at Fonthill, and began to  spend there abundantly on building and rebuilding.  Perhaps he thought of  Vathek's tower when he employed workmen day and night to build a tower  for himself three hundred feet high, and set them to begin it again when  it fell down.  He is said to have spent upon Fonthill a quarter of a  million, living there in much seclusion during the last twenty years of  his life.  He died in 1844.    The happy thought of this William Beckford's life was \"Vathek.\"  It is a  story that paints neither man nor outward nature as they are, but  reproduces with happy vivacity the luxuriant imagery and wild incidents  of an Arabian tale.  There is a ghost of a moral in the story of a  sensual Caliph going to the bad, as represented by his final introduction  to the Halls of Eblis.  But the enjoyment given by the book reflects the  real enjoyment that the author had in writing it--enjoyment great enough  to cause it to be written at a heat, in one long sitting, without  flagging power.  Young and lively, he delivered himself up to a free run  of fancy, revelled in the piled-up enormities of the Wicked Mother, who  had not brought up Vathek properly, and certainly wrote some parts of his  nightmare tale as merrily as if he were designing matter for a pantomime.    Whoever, in reading \"Vathek,\" takes it altogether seriously, does not  read it as it was written.  We must have an eye for the vein of  caricature that now and then comes to the surface, and invites a laugh  without disturbing the sense of Eastern extravagance bent seriously upon  the elaboration of a tale crowded with incident and action.  Taken  altogether seriously, the book has faults of construction.  But the  faults turn into beauties when we catch the twinkle in the writer's eye.                                                                         H. M.          THE HISTORY OF THE CALIPH VATHEK      Vathek, ninth Caliph of the race of the Abassides, was the son of  Motassem, and the grandson of Haroun Al Raschid.  From an early accession  to the throne, and the talents he possessed to adorn it, his subjects  were induced to expect that his reign would be long and happy.  His  figure was pleasing and majestic; but when he was angry one of his eyes  became so terrible that no person could bear to behold it, and the wretch  upon whom it was fixed instantly fell backward, and sometimes expired.  For fear, however, of depopulating his dominions and making his palace  desolate he but rarely gave way to his anger.    Being much addicted to women and the pleasures of the table, he sought by  his affability to procure agreeable companions; and he succeeded the  better as his generosity was unbounded, and his indulgences unrestrained,  for he was by no means scrupulous, nor did he think with the Caliph Omar  Ben Abdalaziz that it was necessary to make a hell of this world to enjoy  Paradise in the next.    He surpassed in magnificence all his predecessors.  The palace of  Alkoremmi, which his father Motassem had erected on the hill of Pied  Horses, and which commanded the whole city of Samarah, was in his idea  far too scanty; he added therefore five wings, or rather other palaces,  which he destined for the particular gratification of each of his senses.    In the first of these were tables continually covered with the most  exquisite dainties, which were supplied both by night and by day,  according to their constant consumption, whilst the most delicious wines  and the choicest cordials flowed forth from a hundred fountains that were  never exhausted.  This palace was called \"The Eternal or Unsatiating  Banquet.\"    The second was styled \"The Temple of Melody, or the Nectar of the Soul.\"  It was inhabited by the most skilful musicians and admired poets of the  time, who not only displayed their talents within, but, dispersing in  bands without, caused every surrounding scene to reverberate their songs,  which were continually varied in the most delightful succession.    The palace named \"The Delight of the Eyes, or the Support of Memory,\" was  one entire enchantment.  Rarities collected from every corner of the  earth were there found in such profusion as to dazzle and confound, but  for the order in which they were arranged.  One gallery exhibited the  pictures of the celebrated Mani, and statues that seemed to be alive.  Here a well-managed perspective attracted the sight; there the magic of  optics agreeably deceived it; whilst the naturalist on his part  exhibited, in their several"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net                          THE MAGIC CITY    BY  E.

They had a little garden and a little balcony,  and a little stable with a little pony in it--and a little cart for the  pony to draw; a little canary hung in a little cage in the little  bow-window, and the neat little servant kept everything as bright and  clean as a little new pin.    Philip had no one but his sister, and she had no one but Philip. Their  parents were dead, and Helen, who was twenty years older than Philip and  was really his half-sister, was all the mother he had ever known. And he  had never envied other boys their mothers, because Helen was so kind and  clever and dear. She gave up almost all her time to him; she taught him  all the lessons he learned; she played with him, inventing the most  wonderful new games and adventures. So that every morning when Philip  woke he knew that he was waking to a new day of joyous and interesting  happenings. And this went on till Philip was ten years old, and he had  no least shadow of a doubt that it would go on for ever. The beginning  of the change came one day when he and Helen had gone for a picnic to  the wood where the waterfall was, and as they were driving back behind  the stout old pony, who was so good and quiet that Philip was allowed to  drive it. They were coming up the last lane before the turning where  their house was, and Helen said:    'To-morrow we'll weed the aster bed and have tea in the garden.'    'Jolly,' said Philip, and they turned the corner and came in sight of  their white little garden gate. And a man was coming out of it--a man  who was not one of the friends they both knew. He turned and came to  meet them. Helen put her hand on the reins--a thing which she had always  taught Philip was _never_ done--and the pony stopped. The man, who was,  as Philip put it to himself, 'tall and tweedy,' came across in front of  the pony's nose and stood close by the wheel on the side where Helen  sat. She shook hands with him, and said, 'How do you do?' in quite the  usual way. But after that they whispered. Whispered! And Philip knew  how rude it is to whisper, because Helen had often told him this. He  heard one or two words, 'at last,' and 'over now,' and 'this evening,  then.'    After that Helen said, 'This is my brother Philip,' and the man shook  hands with him--across Helen, another thing which Philip knew was not  manners, and said, 'I hope we shall be the best of friends.' Pip said,  'How do you do?' because that is the polite thing to say. But inside  himself he said, 'I don't want to be friends with _you_.'    Then the man took off his hat and walked away, and Philip and his sister  went home. She seemed different, somehow, and he was sent to bed a  little earlier than usual, but he could not go to sleep for a long time,  because he heard the front-door bell ring and afterwards a man's voice  and Helen's going on and on in the little drawing-room under the room  which was his bedroom. He went to sleep at last, and when he woke up in  the morning it was raining, and the sky was grey and miserable. He lost  his collar-stud, he tore one of his stockings as he pulled it on, he  pinched his finger in the door, and he dropped his tooth-mug, with water  in it too, and the mug was broken and the water went into his boots.  There are mornings, you know, when things happen like that. This was  one of them.    Then he went down to breakfast, which tasted not quite so nice as usual.  He was late, of course. The bacon fat was growing grey with waiting for  him, as Helen said, in the cheerful voice that had always said all the  things he liked best to hear. But Philip didn't smile. It did not seem  the sort of morning for smiling, and the grey rain beat against the  window.    After breakfast Helen said, 'Tea in the garden is indefinitely  postponed, and it's too wet for lessons.'    That was one of her charming ideas--that wet days should not be made  worse by lessons.    'What shall we do?' she said; 'shall we talk about the island? Shall I  make another map of it? And put in all the gardens and fountains and  swings?'    The island was a favourite play. Somewhere in the warm seas where palm  trees are, and rainbow-coloured sands, the island was said to be--their  own island, beautified by their fancy with everything they liked and  wanted, and Philip was never tired of talking about it. There were times  when he almost believed that the island was real. He was king of the  island and Helen was queen, and no one else was to be allowed on it.  Only these two.    But this morning even the thought of the island failed to charm. Philip  straggled away to the window and looked out dismally at the soaked lawn  and the dripping laburnum trees, and the row of raindrops hanging fat  and full on the iron gate.    'What is it, Pippin?' Helen asked. 'Don't tell me you're going to have  horrid measles, or red-hot scarlet fever, or noisy whooping-cough.'    She came across and laid her hand on his forehead.    'Why, you're quite hot, boy of my heart. Tell sister, what is it?'    '_You_ tell _me_,' said Philip slowly.    'Tell you what, Pip?'    'You think you ought to bear it alone, like in books, and be noble and  all that. But you _must_ tell me; you promised you'd never have any  secrets from me, Helen, you know you did.'    Helen put her arm round him and said nothing. And from her silence Pip  drew the most desperate and harrowing conclusions. The silence lasted.  The rain gurgled in the water-pipe and dripped on the ivy. The canary in  the green cage that hung in the window put its head on one side and  tweaked a seed husk out into Philip's face, then twittered defiantly.  But his sister said nothing.    'Don't,' said Philip suddenly, 'don't break it to me; tell me straight  out.'    'Tell you what?' she said again.    'What is it?' he said. '_I_ know how "]]]
