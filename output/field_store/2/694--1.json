Ballantyne.    ________________________________________________________________________    This one of the half-dozen or so little books that Ballantyne wrote for  young children.  Many of these, and certainly the earlier ones, were  written under the pseudonym of Comus, but this one went out under his  own name, perhaps because by the time it was published in 1874 his own  name had become much more celebrated than that of his pseudonym.    It was written for very young children, and very amusing they must have  found it, with its characters being the little insects and small mammals  of the fields and woods, who assemble together for a feast.  Naturally  they must have become vegetarian for the day! Anyway, they put away  their warring instincts, and had a good time together, though one or two  incidents caused by the over exuberant during the dancing, threatened to  cause serious mishaps, though all were avoided.    It's a tiny book, perhaps a twentieth of the size of one of Ballantyne's  novels for older children, but it is certainly fun.    ________________________________________________________________________    THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL AND THE GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.  The Butterfly's Ball--by RM Ballantyne        CHAPTER ONE.    THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL AND THE GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST.      Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste    To the Butterfly's ball and the Grasshopper's feast;    For the trumpeter Gadfly has summoned his crew,    And the revels are now only waiting for you.      On the smooth-shaven grass by the side of the wood,    Beneath a broad oak that for ages has stood,    See the children of earth, and the tenants of air,    For an evening's amusement together repair.      And there came the Beetle, so blind, and so black,    Who carried the Emmet, his friend, on his back;    And there came the Gnat, and the Dragonfly too,    And all their relations, green, orange, and blue.      And there came the Moth, with her plumage of down,    And the Hornet, with jacket of yellow and brown,    Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring--    They promised that evening to lay by their sting.      Then the sly little Dormouse peeped out of his hole,    And led to the feast his blind cousin the Mole;    And the Snail, with her horns peeping out from her shell,    Came fatigued with the distance, the length of an ell.      A Mushroom the table, and on it was spread    A Water-dock leaf, which their table-cloth made;    The viands were various, to each of their taste,    And the Bee brought the honey to sweeten the feast.      With steps more majestic the Snail did advance,    And he promised the gazers a minuet dance;    But they all laughed so loudly, he pulled in his head,    And went, in his own little chamber, to bed.      Then, as evening gave way to the shadows of night,    Their watchman, the Glow-worm, came out with his light.    So home let us hasten, while yet we can see,    For no watchman is waiting for you or for me.    The Butterfly's Ball--by RM Ballantyne        CHAPTER TWO.    THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL AND THE GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST.      Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste    To the Butterfly's ball and the Grasshopper's feast;    For the trumpeter Gadfly has summoned his crew,    And the revels are now only waiting for you.      On the smooth-shaven grass by the side of the wood,    Beneath a broad oak that for ages has stood,    See the children of earth, and the tenants of air,    For an evening's amusement together repair.    It was very early one delightful morning in summer, when the trumpeter  Gadfly sounded his horn, inviting all the insects in the forest to the  Butterfly's ball and the Grasshopper's feast.  The sun shone brightly,  the air was mild and soft, and the scent of the wild flowers delicious,  so that not one of the insects thought of staying at home.  Butterflies,  Beetles, Bees, Wasps, Snails, Grasshoppers, Ants, all put on their best  coats and frocks, all, put on their sweetest smiles, and all hurried  off, in little bands, to the ball, talking and laughing, and humming and  buzzing, by the way, as if they were the happiest creatures in the wide  world.  Even the old Beetle, that had been run over by a cart-wheel and  squeezed nearly to death, got out of bed when he heard what was going  on, and limped along with the rest, though he had been confined to the  house for six months before.  One or two Butterflies, that were never  known to go out except in the very finest weather,--and even then,  carefully wrapped up,--determined to venture.  They were long in making  up their minds about it.  One thought it looked a very little like rain;  another feared that the light breeze might give them a cold.  However,  they put on a great many cloaks, and went.    From all directions they came, and assembled on a smooth, grassy spot,  under an old oak-tree, where the revels were to take place.  Some  crawled slowly along the ground, some bounded quickly over hill and  dale, some came running and tumbling, jumping and hitting against things  in their haste; some came swiftly through the air, and alighted so  suddenly as to tumble head over heels; others flew quietly to the scene  and fluttered lightly about, admiring the gay company they were about to  join.      And there came the Beetle, so blind, and so black,    Who carried the Emmet, his friend, on his back;    And there came the Gnat, and the Dragonfly too,    And all their relations, green, orange, and blue.    The Black Beetle was the first to make his appearance.  He carried his  dear friend the Emmet on his back, and a sad journey they had of it, to  be sure!  Being very blind, the Beetle was constantly falling over  twigs, knocking his shins against the edges of leaves, and tumbling into  ditches, so that the poor Emmet had many terrible falls, and once the  great beetle fell on the top of him and crushed him a good deal.  But it  was very pleasant to see how cheerful they were under all this.  On  getting up after a fall, the beetle always laughed so boisterously that  the tears ran down his cheeks, and his black sides nearly cracked; while  the little Emmet said gaily, \"Ah! my friend, accidents will happen! not  hurt, I hope?  Come, get along once more;\" and then he jumped up on his  friend's back again, and away they went as merrily as ever.    A Gnat and a Dragonfly, with a great many of their relations, arrived  about the same time with the Beetle.  They looked quite charming in  their brilliant dresses, the colours of which were chiefly green,  orange, and blue.  A large Blue-bottle Fly, with a very light waistcoat,  and a hat stuck on one side of his head, said that the Dragonflies were  lovely, and that Miss Gnat was quite killing.  This was an odd thing to  say, but Mr Blue-bottle meant by it, that she was very beautiful.  Indeed, it was said that he fell in love with Miss Gnat, for he danced  with nobody else during the whole afternoon.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------      And there came the Moth, with her plumage of down,    And the Hornet, with jacket of yellow and brown,    Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring--    They promised that evening to lay by their sting.    The Moth was sound asleep when the Gadfly blew his trumpet.  She had sat  up too late the night before, and, owing to having indulged this bad  habit, had overslept herself the following morning.    However, she tried by her activity to make up for lost time; she saw the  other insects hurrying past her house in crowds, so she threw on her  clothes as fast as possible.  The Moth was prettily dressed in a soft  garment of down, and as she was a modest creature, every one loved her.  On leaving home, she observed the Wasp and the Hornet passing.  They  were dressed in rich suits of brown and yellow.  At sight of them she  was a little frightened, and endeavoured to run back to her house until  they should pass by; but they caught sight of her, and immediately gave  chase, screaming out loudly, \"Oh! dear Mrs Moth, pray don't be alarmed.  We have laid by our stings for to-day, and won't hurt you.\"  They soon  caught her, although she ran as fast as she could.  So the Wasp and the  Hornet each offered her an arm, and obliged her to walk between them  while they danced along, shouting, and singing, and winking waggishly to  the friends they passed on the road.  The poor Moth blushed very much at  being seen by all her friends in the company of two such wild creatures.  A Caterpillar and a Long-legged Beetle, besides one or two other  insects that chanced to be near, laughed very heartily on seeing what  had happened.  But the Moth soon recovered her spirits; and when they  arrived at the oak-tree, she was walking along with a sprightly step,  first talking to the Hornet and then chatting to the Wasp, as if they  were her dearest friends.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------      Then the sly little Dormouse peeped out of his hole,    and led to the feast his blind cousin the Mole;    And the Snail, with her horns peeping out from her shell,    Came fatigued with the distance, the length of an ell.    \"Come along, you lazy fellow,\" cried the little Dormouse, knocking with  his ivory-headed cane at the door of a mole-hill.    \"Ay, ay, cousin,\" shouted the Mole, \"I'll be there in a minute.\"    So the Dormouse stood impatiently tapping his boots till the Mole should  be ready.  The Dormouse was dressed in the height of fashion, and  thought himself a rather handsome fellow.  Some people said that he was  conceited, and indeed a Spider that was near at hand plainly told him  so; but, whether this was true or not, there is no doubt that he was a  very kind little fellow, because he came to lead his poor blind cousin  to the feast.    \"What a time you have been, old boy,\" he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21840"],[0,"Woman (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Little & Ives Co.  New York          THE CREATION OF WOMAN      This old Oriental legend is so exquisitely charming, so superior to  the Biblical narrative of the creation of woman, that it deserves to  be reproduced in WOMAN: HER SEX AND LOVE LIFE. There are several  variants of this legend, but I reproduce it as it appeared in the  first issue of THE CRITIC AND GUIDE, January, 1903.        At the beginning of time, Twashtri--the Vulcan of Hindu      mythology--created the world. But when he wished to create a      woman, he found that he had employed all his materials in the      creation of man. There did not remain one solid element. Then      Twashtri, perplexed, fell into a profound meditation from which      he aroused himself and proceeded as follows:        He took the roundness of the moon, the undulations of the      serpent, the entwinement of clinging plants, the trembling of      the grass, the slenderness of the rose-vine and the velvet of      the flower, the lightness of the leaf and the glance of the      fawn, the gaiety of the sun's rays and tears of the mist, the      inconstancy of the wind and the timidity of the hare, the vanity      of the peacock and the softness of the down on the throat of the      swallow, the hardness of the diamond, the sweet flavor of honey      and the cruelty of the tiger, the warmth of fire, the chill of      snow, the chatter of the jay and the cooing of the turtle dove.        He combined all these and formed a woman. Then he made a present      of her to man. Eight days later the man came to Twashtri, and      said: \"My Lord, the creature you gave me poisons my existence.      She chatters without rest, she takes all my time, she laments      for nothing at all, and is always ill; take her back;\" and      Twashtri took the woman back.        But eight days later the man came again to the god and said: \"My      Lord, my life is very solitary since I returned this creature. I      remember she danced before me, singing. I recall how she glanced      at me from the corner of her eye, how she played with me, clung      to me. Give her back to me,\" and Twashtri returned the woman to      him. Three days only passed and Twashtri saw the man coming to      him again. \"My Lord,\" said he, \"I do not understand exactly how      it is, but I am sure that the woman causes me more annoyance      than pleasure. I beg you to relieve me of her.\"        But Twashtri cried: \"Go your way and do the best you can.\" And      the man cried: \"I cannot live with her!\" \"Neither can you live      without her!\" replied Twashtri.        And the man went away sorrowful, murmuring: \"Woe is me, I can      neither live with nor without her.\"          PREFACE      In the first chapter of this book I have shown, I believe  convincingly, why sex knowledge is even more important for women than  it is for men. I have examined carefully the books that have been  written for girls and women, and I know that it is not bias, nor  carping criticism, but strict honesty that forces me to say that I  have not found one satisfactory girl's or woman's sex book. There are  some excellent books for girls and women on general hygiene; but on  sex hygiene, on the general manifestations of the sex instinct, on sex  ethics--none. I have attempted to write such a book. Whether I have  succeeded--fully, partially or not at all--is not for me to say,  though I have my suspicions. But this I know: in writing this book I  have been strictly honest with myself, from first page to last.  Whether everything I have written is the truth, I do not know. But at  least I believe that it is--or I would not have written it. And I can  solemnly say that the book is free from any cant, hypocrisy,  falsehood, exaggeration or compromise, nor has any attempt been made  in any chapter to conciliate the stupid, the ignorant, the pervert, or  the sexless.    As in all my other books I have used plain, honest English. Not any  plainer than necessary, but plain enough to avoid obscurity and  misconception.    Science and art are both necessary to human happiness. This is not the  place to discuss the relative importance of the two. And, while I have  no patience with art-for-art's-sake, I recognize that the scientist  can not be put into a narrow channel and ordered to go into a certain  definite direction. Scientific investigations which seemed aimless and  useless have sometimes led to highly important results, and I would  not disparage science for its own sake. It has its uses. Nevertheless  I personally have no use for it. To me everything must have a direct  human purpose, a definite human application. When the cup of human  life is so overflowing with woe and pain and misery, it seems to me a  narrow dilettanteism or downright charlatanism to devote one's self to  petty or bizarre problems which can have no relation to human  happiness, and to prate of self-satisfaction and self-expression. One  can have all the self-expression one wants while doing useful work.    And working for humanity does not exclude a healthy hedonism; not the  narrow Cyrenaic, but an enlightened altruistic hedonism. And in  writing this book I have kept the human problem constantly before my  eyes. It was not my ambition merely to impart interesting facts: my  concern was the practical application of these facts, their relation  to human happiness.    If this book should be instrumental, as I confidently trust it will,  in destroying some medieval superstitions, in dissipating some  hampering and cramping errors, in instilling some hope in the hearts  of the hopeless, in bringing a little joy into the homes of the  joyless, in increasing in however slight a degree the sum total of  human happiness, its mission shall have been gloriously fulfilled.    For this is the mission of the book: to increase the sum total of  human happiness.                                                   W.J.R.        12 Mount Morris Park W.,      New York City.
