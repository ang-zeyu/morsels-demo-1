MODERN GERMAN CULTURE                                   263          PREFACE      The following pages aim at giving a general view of the social and  intellectual life of Germany from the end of the mediaeval period to  modern times. In the earlier portion of the book, the first half of  the sixteenth century in Germany is dealt with at much greater length  and in greater detail than the later period, a sketch of which forms  the subject of the last two chapters. The reason for this is to be  found in the fact that while the roots of the later German character  and culture are to be sought for in the life of this period, it is  comparatively little known to the average educated English reader. In  the early fifteenth century, during the Reformation era, German life  and culture in its widest sense began to consolidate themselves, and  at the same time to take on an originality which differentiated them  from the general life and culture of Western Europe as it was during  the Middle Ages.    To those who would fully appreciate the later developments, therefore,  it is essential thoroughly to understand the details of the social and  intellectual history of the time in question. For the later period  there are many more works of a generally popular character available  for the student and general reader. The chief aim of the sketch given  in Chapters IX and X is to bring into sharp relief those events which,  in the Author's view, represent more or less crucial stages in the  development of modern Germany.    For the earlier portion of the present volume an older work of the  Author's, now out of print, entitled _German Society at the Close of  the Middle Ages_, has been largely drawn upon. Reference, as will be  seen, has also been made in the course of the present work to two  other writings from the same pen which are still to be had for those  desirous of fuller information on their respective subjects, viz. _The  Peasants' War_ and _The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptists_ (Messrs.  George Allen & Unwin).          German Culture Past and Present      INTRODUCTORY      The close of the fifteenth century had left the whole structure of  mediaeval Europe to all appearance intact. Statesmen and writers like  Philip de Commines had apparently as little suspicion that the state  of things they saw around them, in which they had grown up and of  which they were representatives, was ever destined to pass away, as  others in their turn have since had. Society was organized on the  feudal hierarchy of status. In the first place, a noble class,  spiritual and temporal, was opposed to a peasantry either wholly  servile or but nominally free. In addition to this opposition of noble  and peasant there was that of the township, which, in its corporate  capacity, stood in the relation of lord to the surrounding peasantry.    The township in Germany was of two kinds--first of all, there was the  township that was \"free of the Empire,\" that is, that held nominally  from the Emperor himself (_Reichstadt_), and secondly, there was the  township that was under the domination of an intermediate lord. The  economic basis of the whole was still land; the status of a man or of  a corporation was determined by the mode in which they held their  land. \"No land without a lord\" was the principle of mediaeval polity;  just as \"money has no master\" is the basis of the modern world with  its self-made men. Every distinction of rank in the feudal system was  still denoted for the most part by a special costume. It was a world  of knights in armour, of ecclesiastics in vestments and stoles, of  lawyers in robes, of princes in silk and velvet and cloth of gold, and  of peasants in laced shoe, brown cloak, and cloth hat.    But although the whole feudal organization was outwardly intact, the  thinker who was watching the signs of the times would not have been  long in arriving at the conclusion that feudalism was \"played out,\"  that the whole fabric of mediaeval civilization was becoming dry and  withered, and had either already begun to disintegrate or was on the  eve of doing so. Causes of change had within the past half-century  been working underneath the surface of social life, and were rapidly  undermining the whole structure. The growing use of firearms in war;  the rapid multiplication of printed books; the spread of the new  learning after the taking of Constantinople in 1453, and the  subsequent diffusion of Greek teachers throughout Europe; the surely  and steadily increasing communication with the new world, and the  consequent increase of the precious metals; and, last but not least,  Vasco da Gama's discovery of the new trade route from the East by way  of the Cape--all these were indications of the fact that the  death-knell of the old order of things had struck.    Notwithstanding the apparent outward integrity of the system based on  land tenures, land was ceasing to be the only form of productive  wealth. Hence it was losing the exclusive importance attaching to it  in the earlier period of the Middle Ages. The first form of modern  capitalism had already arisen. Large aggregations of capital in the  hands of trading companies were becoming common. The Roman law was  establishing itself in the place of the old customary tribal law which  had hitherto prevailed in the manorial courts, serving in some sort as  a bulwark against the caprice of the territorial lord; and this change  facilitated the development of the bourgeois principle of private, as  opposed to communal, property. In intellectual matters, though  theology still maintained its supremacy as the chief subject of human  interest, other interests were rapidly growing up alongside of it, the  most prominent being the study of classical literature.    Besides these things, there was the dawning interest in nature, which  took on, as a matter of course, a magical form in accordance with  traditional and contemporary modes of thought. In fact, like the  flicker of a dying candle in its socket, the Middle Ages seemed at the  beginning of the sixteenth century to exhibit all their own salient  characteristics in an exaggerated and distorted form. The old feudal  relations had degenerated into a blood-sucking oppression; the old  rough brutality, into excogitated and elaborated cruelty (aptly  illustrated in the collection of ingenious instruments preserved in  the Torture-tower at Nuernberg); the old crude superstition, into a  systematized magical theory of natural causes and effects; the old  love of pageantry, into a lavish luxury and magnificence of which we  have in the \"field of the cloth of gold\" the stock historical example;  the old chivalry, into the mercenary bravery of the soldier, whose  trade it was to fight, and who recognized only one virtue--to wit,  animal courage. Again, all these exaggerated characteristics were  mixed with new elements, which distorted them further, and which  foreshadowed a coming change, the ultimate issue of which would be  their extinction and that of the life of which they were the signs.    The growing tendency towards centralization and the consequent  suppression or curtailment of the local autonomies of the Middle Ages  in the interests of some kind of national government, of which the  political careers of Louis XI in France, of Edward IV in England, and  of Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain were such conspicuous instances,  did not fail to affect in a lesser degree that loosely connected  political system of German States known as the Holy Roman Empire.  Maximilian's first Reichstag in 1495 caused to be issued an Imperial  edict suppressing the right of private warfare claimed and exercised  by the whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by the  Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF/Gallica) at  http://gallica.bnf.fr)                      [Illustration: Typical French Soldier in Uniform.]    A Journey Through France in War Time    By JOSEPH G.

While the ground covered by these pages may be, therefore, not  unfamiliar, the motives prompting their preparation are probably unique.  It has been undertaken at the request of friends, but not entirely for  their pleasure; since the author hopes that those who read it may see in  the patriotic devotion and courage of the French people something of the  spirit that should animate our country, whose aspirations toward liberty  the French aided even before they were themselves free.    Written in hours snatched for the task amid the press of other duties,  these pages endeavor to present a simple, intimate and personal story of  experiences enjoyed and impressions gained under most unusual  circumstances and herein shared with my friends as one of the most  interesting incidents of a long and busy life.    * * *          A Journey Through France in War Time    ORIGIN OF THE PURPOSE OF THE TRIP      In the Autumn and Winter of 1915, a body of distinguished and  representative Frenchmen visited the United States, their object being  to make an investigation of conditions here, having in mind the great  need of France in war munitions, the steel in ingot and bar form very  much needed for the manufacture of war materials, and the numerous other  commodities necessary for prosecution of the war, which had been in  progress more than a year.    The finances of France were also very much in evidence in the minds of  the visitors.    The names and occupation of this French Trade Commission appear  following:    Chairman--Monsieur Maurice Damour,  Secretary of the French Deputies' Commission  on Appropriations.    Monsieur Jacquez Lesueur,  Delegate of the Ministry of Agriculture.    Monsieur L. Trincano,  Director of the Horological School of Besancon.    Monsieur Jacquez de Neuflize,  Banker.    Monsieur M. Chouffour,  of the Credit Francais.    Monsieur L. Vibien,  Director of the National Bank of Credit.    Monsieur E. Delassale-Thiriez,  Secretary of the Syndicate of Spinners.    Monsieur M. Saladin,  Delegate of the Creusot Factory.    Monsieur Joseph Guinet,  Delegate of the Chamber of Commerce of  Lyons.    This Commission visited various parts of the United States, principally  the great iron and steel centers, Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Chicago.    Much attention was shown the party in their journey through our land.    An introductory luncheon to this French Commission was given by The  American Manufacturers Export Association at the Hotel Biltmore, New  York, Tuesday, November 23rd, 1915. This luncheon was attended by a  representative number of American manufacturers and bankers, and the  object of the visitors fully discussed. On this occasion it was  suggested by Mr. E. V. Douglass, the efficient secretary of the Export  Association, that a return visit of Americans would be in order and  would assist in accomplishing the object of the visitors. This  suggestion was followed up early in 1916 and took form later on in the  appointment and selection of the members of \"The Commission Industrielle  Americaine en France\", the expedition being organized and financed under  the direction of The American Manufacturers' Export Association, located  at 160 Broadway, New York City.    This association has an active membership of over five hundred  manufacturers, firms and corporations engaged in the production of all  kinds of fabricated materials, from steel to women's lingerie.    The president of the association, Mr. E. M. Herr, of Pittsburgh, closely  associated with the Westinghouse interests, was the moving spirit in  creating and selecting the organization and formulating the plans and  policy of the Industrial Commission, even to the extent of selecting the  chairman.    The membership of the commission, their occupations, business and  professional status, is given herewith:    M. W. W.
