In the olden time, when wishing was having, there lived a King, whose  daughters were all beautiful; but the youngest was so exceedingly  beautiful that the Sun himself, although he saw her very often, was  enchanted every time she came out into the sunshine.    Near the castle of this King was a large and gloomy forest, and in the  midst stood an old lime-tree, beneath whose branches splashed a little  fountain; so, whenever it was very hot, the King's youngest daughter ran  off into this wood, and sat down by the side of this fountain; and, when  she felt dull, would often divert herself by throwing a golden ball up  in the air and catching it. And this was her favourite amusement.    Now, one day it happened, that this golden ball, when the King's  daughter threw it into the air, did not fall down into her hand, but  on the grass; and then it rolled past her into the fountain. The King's  daughter followed the ball with her eyes, but it disappeared beneath  the water, which was so deep that no one could see to the bottom. Then  she began to lament, and to cry louder and louder; and, as she cried, a  voice called out, \"Why weepest thou, O King's daughter? thy tears would  melt even a stone to pity.\" And she looked around to the spot whence  the voice came, and saw a Frog stretching his thick ugly head out of  the water. \"Ah! you old water-paddler,\" said she, \"was it you that  spoke? I am weeping for my golden ball, which has slipped away from  me into the water.\"    [Illustration]    \"Be quiet, and do not cry,\" answered the Frog; \"I can give thee good  advice. But what wilt thou give me if I fetch thy plaything up again?\"    \"What will you have, dear Frog?\" said she. \"My dresses, my pearls and  jewels, or the golden crown which I wear?\"    The Frog answered, \"Dresses, or jewels, or golden crowns, are not  for me; but if thou wilt love me, and let me be thy companion and  playfellow, and sit at thy table, and eat from thy little golden  plate, and drink out of thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed,--if  thou wilt promise me all these, then will I dive down and fetch up  thy golden ball.\"    [Illustration]    \"Oh, I will promise you all,\" said she, \"if you will only get me my  ball.\" But she thought to herself, \"What is the silly Frog chattering  about? Let him remain in the water with his equals; he cannot mix in  society.\" But the Frog, as soon as he had received her promise, drew his  head under the water and dived down. Presently he swam up again with the  ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was  full of joy when she again saw her beautiful plaything; and, taking it  up, she ran off immediately. \"Stop! stop!\" cried the Frog; \"take me with  thee. I cannot run as thou canst.\" But all his croaking was useless;  although it was loud enough, the King's daughter did not hear it, but,  hastening home, soon forgot the poor Frog, who was obliged to leap back  into the fountain.    The next day, when the King's daughter was sitting at table with her  father and all his courtiers, and was eating from her own little golden  plate, something was heard coming up the marble stairs, splish-splash,  splish-splash; and when it arrived at the top, it knocked at the door,  and a voice said, \"Open the door, thou youngest daughter of the King!\"  So she rose and went to see who it was that called her; but when she  opened the door and caught sight of the Frog, she shut it again with  great vehemence, and sat down at the table, looking very pale. But  the King perceived that her heart was beating violently, and asked  her whether it were a giant who had come to fetch her away who stood  at the door. \"Oh, no!\" answered she; \"it is no giant, but an ugly Frog.\"    \"What does the Frog want with you?\" said the King.    \"Oh, dear father, when I was sitting yesterday playing by the fountain,  my golden ball fell into the water, and this Frog fetched it up again  because I cried so much: but first, I must tell you, he pressed me so  much, that I promised him he should be my companion. I never thought  that he could come out of the water, but somehow he has jumped out, and  now he wants to come in here.\"    At that moment there was another knock, and a voice said,--        \"King's daughter, youngest,          Open the door.      Hast thou forgotten      Thy promises made      At the fountain so clear      'Neath the lime-tree's shade?      King's daughter, youngest,          Open the door.\"    Then the King said, \"What you have promised, that you must perform; go  and let him in.\" So the King's daughter went and opened the door, and  the Frog hopped in after her right up to her chair: and as soon as she  was seated, the Frog said, \"Take me up;\" but she hesitated so long that  at last the King ordered her to obey. And as soon as the Frog sat on the  chair, he jumped on to the table, and said, \"Now push thy plate near me,  that we may eat together.\" And she did so, but as everyone saw, very  unwillingly. The Frog seemed to relish his dinner much, but every bit  that the King's daughter ate nearly choked her, till at last the Frog  said, \"I have satisfied my hunger and feel very tired; wilt thou carry  me upstairs now into thy chamber, and make thy bed ready that we may  sleep together?\" At this speech the King's daughter began to cry, for  she was afraid of the cold Frog, and dared not touch him; and besides,  he actually wanted to sleep in her own beautiful, clean bed.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    But her tears only made the King very angry, and he said, \"He who  helped you in the time of your trouble, must not now be despised!\" So  she took the Frog up with two fingers, and put him in a corner of her  chamber. But as she lay in her bed, he crept up to it, and said, \"I am  so very tired that I shall sleep well; do take me up or I will tell thy  father.\" This speech put the King's daughter in a terrible passion, and  catching the Frog up, she threw him with all her strength against the  wall, saying, \"Now, will you be quiet, you ugly Frog?\"    But as he fell he was changed from a frog into a handsome Prince with  beautiful eyes, who, after a little while became, with her father's  consent, her dear companion and betrothed. Then he told her how he had  been transformed by an evil witch, and that no one but herself could  have had the power to take him out of the fountain; and that on the  morrow they would go together into his own kingdom.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The next morning, as soon as the sun rose, a carriage drawn by eight  white horses, with ostrich feathers on their heads, and golden bridles,  drove up to the door of the palace, and behind the carriage stood the  trusty Henry, the servant of the young Prince. When his master was  changed into a frog, trusty Henry had grieved so much that he had bound  three iron bands round his heart, for fear it should break with grief  and sorrow. But now that the carriage was ready to carry the young  Prince to his own country, the faithful Henry helped in the bride and  bridegroom, and placed himself in the seat behind, full of joy at his  master's release. They had not proceeded far when the Prince heard a  crack as if something had broken behind the carriage; so he put his head  out of the window and asked Henry what was broken, and Henry answered,  \"It was not the carriage, my master, but a band which I bound round my  heart when it was in such grief because you were changed into a frog.\"    Twice afterwards on the journey there was the same noise, and each time  the Prince thought that it was some part of the carriage that had given  way; but it was only the breaking of the bands which bound the heart of  the trusty Henry, who was thenceforward free and happy.          PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE.      Once upon a time there were three Princesses, named Roussette, Brunette,  and Blondine, who lived in retirement with their mother, a Princess who  had lost all her former grandeur. One day an old woman called and asked  for a dinner, as this Princess was an excellent cook. After the meal was  over, the old woman, who was a fairy, promised that their kindness  should be rewarded, and immediately disappeared.    Shortly after, the King came that way, with his brother and the Lord  Admiral. They were all so struck with the beauty of the three  Princesses, that the King married the youngest, Blondine, his brother  married Brunette, and the Lord Admiral married Roussette.    The good Fairy, who had brought all this about, also caused the young  Queen Blondine to have three lovely children, two boys and a girl, out  of whose hair fell fine jewels. Each had a brilliant star on the  forehead, and a rich chain of gold around the neck. At the same time  Brunette, her sister, gave birth to a handsome boy. Now the young Queen  and Brunette were much attached to each other, but Roussette was jealous  of both, and the old Queen, the King's mother, hated them. Brunette died  soon after the birth of her son, and the King was absent on a warlike  expedition, so Roussette joined the wicked old Queen in forming plans to  injure Blondine. They ordered Feintise, the old Queen's waiting-woman,  to strangle the Queen's three children and the son of Princess Brunette,  and bury them secretly. But as she was about to execute this wicked  order, she was so struck by their beauty, and the appearance of the  sparkling stars on their foreheads, that she shrank from the deed.    So she had a boat brought round to the beach, and put the four babes,  with some strings of jewels, into a cradle, which she placed in the  boat, and then set it adrift. The boat was soon far out at sea. The  waves rose, the rain poured in torrents, and the thunder roared.  Feintise could not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B.

Susan B. Anthony followed this  tradition. Convinced that the principle of equal rights for all, as  stated in the Declaration of Independence, must be expressed in the  laws of a true republic, she devoted her life to the establishment of  this ideal.    Because she recognized in Negro slavery and in the legal bondage of  women flagrant violations of this principle, she became an active,  courageous, effective antislavery crusader and a champion of civil and  political rights for women. She saw women's struggle for freedom from  legal restrictions as an important phase in the development of  American democracy. To her this struggle was never a battle of the  sexes, but a battle such as any freedom-loving people would wage for  civil and political rights.    While her goals for women were only partially realized in her  lifetime, she prepared the soil for the acceptance not only of her  long-hoped-for federal woman suffrage amendment but for a worldwide  recognition of human rights, now expressed in the United Nations  Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights. She looked forward to the  time when throughout the world there would be no discrimination  because of race, color, religion, or sex.
