Ras Hume paused at the border of scented spike-flowers on the top  terrace of the Pleasure House to wonder why he thought of serpents. He  understood. Mankind's age-old hatred, brought from his native planet  to the distant stars, was evil symbolized by a coil in a twisted,  belly-path across the ground. And on Nahuatl, as well as a dozen other  worlds, Wass was the serpent.    A night wind was rising, stirring the exotic, half-dozen other worlds'  foliage planted cunningly on the terrace to simulate the mystery of an  off-world jungle.    \"Hume?\" The inquiry seemed to come out of thin air over his head.    \"Hume,\" he repeated his own name calmly.    A shaft of light brilliant enough to dazzle the eyes struck through  the massed vegetation, revealing a path. Hume lingered for a moment,  offering a counterstroke of indifference in what he had always known  would be a test of wits. Wass was Veep of a shadowy empire, but that  was apart from the world in which Ras Hume moved.    He strode deliberately down the corridor illuminated between leaf and  blossom walls. A grotesque lump of crystal leered at him from the  heart of a tharsala lilly bed. The intricate carving of a devilish  nonhuman set of features was a work of alien art. Tendrils of smoke  curled from the thing's flat nostrils, and Hume sniffed the scent of a  narcotic he recognized. He smiled. Such measures might soften up the  usual civ Wass interviewed here. But a star pilot turned out-hunter  was immunized against such mind clouding.    There was a door, the lintel and posts of which had more carving, but  this time Terran, Hume thought--old, very old. Perhaps rumor was  right, Milfors Wass might be truly native Terran and not second,  third, nor fourth generation star stock as most of those who reached  Nahuatl were.    The room beyond that elaborately carved entrance was, in contrast,  severe. Rust walls were bare of any pattern save an oval disk of  cloudy golden shimmer behind the chair at the long table of solid ruby  rock from Nahuatl's poisonous sister planet of Xipe. Without a pause  he walked to the chair and seated himself without invitation to wait  in the empty room.    That clouded oval might be a com device. Hume refused to look at it  after his first glance. This interview was to be person to person. If  Wass did not appear within a reasonable length of time he would leave.    And Hume hoped to any unseen watcher he presented the appearance of a  man not impressed by stage settings. After all he was now in the  seller's space boots, and it was a seller's market.    Ras Hume rested his right hand on the table. Against the polished glow  of the stone, the substance of it was flesh-tanned brown--a perfect  match for his left. And the subtle difference between true flesh and  false was no hindrance in the use of those fingers or their strength.  Save that it had pushed him out of command of a cargo-cum-liner and  hurled him down from the pinnacle of a star pilot. There were bitter  brackets about his mouth, set there by that hand as deeply as if  carved with a knife.    It had been four years--planet time--since he had lifted the Rigal  Rover from the launch pad on Sargon Two. He had suspected it might be  a tricky voyage with young Tors Wazalitz, who was a third owner of the  Kogan-Bors-Wazalitz line, and a Gratz chewer. But one did not argue  with the owners, except when the safety of the ship was concerned. The  Rigal Rover had made a crash landing at Alexbut, and a badly injured  pilot had brought her in by will, hope and a faith he speedily lost.    He received a plasta-hand, the best the medical center could supply  and a pension for life, forced by the public acclaim for a man who had  saved ships and lives. Then--the sack because a crazed Tors Wazalitz  was dead. They dared not try to stick Hume with a murder charge; the  voyage record tapes had been shot straight through to the Patrol  Council, and the evidence on those could be neither faked nor tampered  with. They could not give him a quick punishment, but they could try  to arrange a slow death. The word had gone out that Hume was off pilot  boards. They had tried to keep him out of space.    And they might have done it, too, had he been the usual type of pilot,  knowing only his trade. But some odd streak of restlessness had always  led him to apply for the rim runs, the very first flights to newly  opened worlds. Outside of the survey men, there were few qualified  pilots of his seniority who possessed such a wide and varied knowledge  of the galactic frontiers.    So when he learned that the ships' boards were irrevocably closed to  him, Hume had signed up with the Out-Hunters' Guild. There was a vast  difference between lifting a liner from a launching pad and guiding  civ hunters to worlds surveyed and staked out for their trips into the  wild. Hume relished the exploration part--he disliked the  leading-by-the-hand of nine-tenths of the Guild's clients.    But if he had not been in the Guild service he would never have made  that find on Jumala. That lucky, lucky find! Hume's plasta-flesh  fingers curved, their nails drew across the red surface of the table.  And where was Wass? He was about to rise and go when the golden oval  on the wall smoked, its substance thinning to a mist as a man stepped  through to the floor.    The newcomer was small compared to the former pilot, but he had  breadth of shoulder which made the upper part of his torso overbalance  his thin hips and legs. He was dressed most conservatively except for  a jeweled plaque resting on the tightly stretched gray silk of his  upper tunic at heart level. Unlike Hume he wore no visible arms belt,  but the other did not doubt that there were a number of devices  concealed in that room to counter the efforts of any assassin.    The man from the mirror spoke with a flat, toneless voice. His black  hair had been shaven well above his ears, the locks left on top of his  skull trained into a kind of bird's crest. As Hume, his visible areas  of flesh were deeply browned, but by nature rather than exposure to  space, the pilot guessed. His features were harsh, with a prominent  nose, a back-slanting forehead, eyes dark, long and large, with heavy  lids.    \"Now--\" He spread both his hands, palm down and flat on the table, a  gesture Hume found himself for some unknown reason copying. \"You have  a proposition?\"    But the pilot was not to be hurried, any more than he was to be  influenced by Wass' stage-settings.    \"I have an idea,\" he corrected.    \"There are many ideas.\" Wass leaned back in his chair, but he did not  remove his hands from the table. \"Perhaps one in a thousand is the  kernel of something useful. For the rest, there is no need to trouble  a man.\"    \"Agreed,\" Hume returned evenly. \"But that one idea in a thousand can  also pay off in odds of a million to one, when and if a man has it.\"    \"And you have such a one?\"    \"I have such a one.\" It was Hume's role now to impress the other by  his unshakable confidence. He had studied all the possibilities. Wass  was the right man, perhaps the only partner he could find. But Wass  must not know that.    \"On Jumala?\" Wass returned.    If that stare and statement was intended to rattle Hume it was a  wasted shot. To discover that he had just returned from that frontier  planet required no ingenuity on the Veep's part.    \"Perhaps.\"    \"Come, Out-Hunter Hume. We are both busy men, this is no time to play  tricks with words and hints. Either you have made a find worth the  attention of my organization or you have not. Let me be the judge.\"    This was it--the corner of no return. But Wass had his own code. The  Veep had established his tight control of his lawless organization by  set rules, and one of them was, don't be greedy. Wass was never  greedy, which is why the patrol had never been able to pull him down,  and those who dealt with him did not talk. If you had a good thing,  and Wass accepted temporary partnership, he kept his side of the  bargain rigidly. You did the same--or regretted your stupidity.    \"A claimant to the Kogan estate--that good enough for you?\"    Wass showed no surprise. \"And how would such a claimant be profitable  to us?\"    Hume appreciated that \"us\"; he had an in now. \"If you supply the  claimant, surely you can claim a reward, in more ways than one.\"    \"True. But one does not produce a claimant out of a Krusha dream. The  investigation for any such claim now would be made by a verity lab and  no imposture will pass those tests. While a real claimant would not  need your help or mine.\"    \"Depends upon the claimant.\"    \"One you discovered on Jumala?\"    \"No.\" Hume shook his head slowly. \"I found something else on  Jumala--an L-B from Largo Drift intact and in good shape. From the  evidence now in existence it could have landed there with survivors  aboard.\"    \"And the evidence of such survivors living on--that exists also?\"    Hume shrugged, his plasta-flesh fingers flexed slightly. \"It has been  six planet years, there is a forest where the L-B rests. No, no  evidence at present.\"    \"The Largo Drift,\" Wass repeated slowly, \"carrying, among others,  Gentlefem"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19092"],[0,"The Adventures of Paddy Beaver (#1)"],[1,"Yarroll, and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                    [Illustration: Paddy pretended to be terribly frightened. _Page 80_.]      THE  ADVENTURES OF    Paddy  BEAVER    THORNTON W.

This little rhyme Paddy the Beaver made up as he toiled at building the  dam which was to make the pond he so much desired deep in the Green  Forest. Of course it wasn't quite true, that about working all night and  all day. Nobody could do that, you know, and keep it up. Everybody has  to rest and sleep. Yes, and everybody has to play a little to be at  their best. So it wasn't quite true that Paddy worked all day after  working all night. But it was true that Paddy had no time to play. He  had too much to do. He had had his playtime during the long summer, and  now he had to get ready for the long cold winter.    Now of all the little workers in the Green Forest, on the Green Meadows,  and in the Smiling Pool, none can compare with Paddy the Beaver, not  even his cousin, Jerry Muskrat. Happy Jack Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk  store up food for the long cold months when rough Brother North Wind and  Jack Frost rule, and Jerry Muskrat builds a fine house wherein to keep  warm and comfortable, but all this is as nothing to the work of Paddy  the Beaver.    As I said before, Paddy had had a long playtime through the summer. He  had wandered up and down the Laughing Brook. He had followed it way up  to the place where it started. And all the time he had been studying and  studying to make sure that he wanted to stay in the Green Forest. In the  first place, he had to be sure that there was plenty of the kind of food  that he likes. Then he had to be equally sure that he could make a pond  near where this particular food grew. Last of all, he had to satisfy  himself that if he did make a pond and build a home, he would be  reasonably safe in it. And all these things he had done in his playtime.  Now he was ready to go to work, and when Paddy begins work, he sticks to  it until it is finished. He says that is the only way to succeed, and  you know and I know that he is right.    Now Paddy the Beaver can see at night just as Reddy Fox and Peter  Rabbit and Bobby Coon can, and he likes the night best, because he feels  safest then. But he can see in the daytime too, and when he feels that  he is perfectly safe and no one is watching, he works then too. Of  course the first thing to do was to build a dam across the Laughing  Brook to make the pond he so much needed. He chose a low open place deep  in the Green Forest, around the edge of which grew many young  aspen-trees, the bark of which is his favorite food. Through the middle  of this open place flowed the Laughing Brook. At the lower edge was just  the place for a dam. It would not have to be very long, and when it was  finished and the water was stopped in the Laughing Brook, it would just  have to flow over the low open place and make a pond there. Paddy's eyes  twinkled when he first saw it. It was right then that he made up his  mind to stay in the Green Forest.    So now that he was ready to begin his dam he went up the Laughing  Brook to a place where alders and willows grew, and there he began  work; that work was the cutting of a great number of trees by means  of his big front teeth which were given him for just this purpose.  And as he worked, Paddy was happy, for one can never be truly happy  who does no work.          II    PADDY PLANS A POND      Paddy the Beaver was busy cutting down trees for the dam he had planned  to build. Up in the woods of the North from which he had come to the  Green Forest he had learned all about tree-cutting and dam-building and  canal-digging and house-building. Paddy's father and mother had been  very wise in the ways of the Beaver world, and Paddy had been quick to  learn. So now he knew just what to do and the best way of doing it. You  know a great many people waste time and labor doing things the wrong  way, so that they have to be done over again. They forget to be sure  they are right, and so they go ahead until they find they are wrong,  and all their work goes for nothing.    But Paddy the Beaver isn't this kind. Paddy would never have leaped  into the spring with the steep sides without looking, as Grandfather  Frog did. So now he carefully picked out the trees to cut. He could  not afford to waste time cutting down a tree that wasn't going to be  just what he wanted when it was down. When he was sure that the tree  was right, he looked up at the top to find out whether, when he had  cut it, it would fall clear of other trees. He had learned to do that  when he was quite young and heedless. He remembered just how he had  felt when after working hard, oh, so hard, to cut a big tree, he had  warned all his friends to get out of the way so that they would not be  hurt when it fell, and then it hadn't fallen at all because the top had  caught in another tree. He was so mortified that he didn't get over it  for a long time.    So now he made sure that a tree was going to fall clear and just where  he wanted it. Then he sat up on his hind legs, and with his great broad  tail for a brace, began to make the chips fly. You know Paddy has the  most wonderful teeth for cutting. They are long and broad and sharp.  He would begin by making a deep bite, and then another just a little  way below. Then he would pry out the little piece of wood between.  When he had cut very deep on one side so that the tree would fall that  way, he would work around to the other side. Just as soon as the tree  began to lean and he was sure that it was going to fall, he would  scamper away so as to be out of danger. He loved to see those tall  trees lean forward slowly, then faster and faster, till they struck  the ground with a crash.    Just as soon as they were down, he would trim off the branches until  the trees were just long poles. This was easy work, for he could take  off a good-sized branch with one bite. On many he left their bushy  tops. When he had trimmed them to suit him and had cut them into the  right lengths, he would tug and pull them down to the place where he  meant to build his dam.    There he placed the poles side by side, not across the Laughing Brook  like a bridge, but with the big ends pointing up the Laughing Brook,  which was quite broad but shallow right there. To keep them from  floating away, he rolled stones and piled mud on the bushy ends. Clear  across on both sides he laid those poles until the land began to rise.  Then he dragged more poles and piled on top of these and wedged short  sticks crosswise between them.    And all the time the Laughing Brook was having harder and harder work  to run. Its merry laugh grew less merry and finally almost stopped,  because, you see, the water could not get through between all those  poles and sticks fast enough. It was just about that time that the  little people of the Smiling Pool decided that it was time to see just  what Paddy was doing, and they started up the Laughing Brook, leaving  only Grandfather Frog and the tadpoles in the Smiling Pool, which for a  little while would smile no more.          III    PADDY HAS MANY VISITORS      Paddy the Beaver knew perfectly well that he would have visitors just  as soon as he began to build his dam. He expected a lot of them. You  see, he knew that none of them ever had seen a Beaver at work unless  perhaps it was Prickly Porky the Porcupine, who also had come down  from the North. So as he worked he kept his ears open, and he smiled  to himself as he heard a little rustle here and then a little rustle  there. He knew just what those little rustles meant. Each one meant  another visitor. Yes, Sir, each rustle meant another visitor, and yet  not one had shown himself.    Paddy chuckled. \"Seems to me that you are dreadfully afraid to show  yourselves,\" said he in a loud voice, just as if he were talking to  nobody in particular. Everything was still. There wasn't so much as a  rustle after Paddy spoke. He chuckled again. He could just _feel_ ever  so many eyes watching him, though he didn't see a single pair. And he  knew that the reason his visitors were hiding so carefully was because  they were afraid of him. You see, Paddy was much bigger than most of the  little meadow and forest people, and they didn't know what kind of a  temper he might have. It is always safest to be very distrustful of  strangers. That is one of the very first things taught all little meadow  and forest children.    Of course, Paddy knew all about this. "]]]
