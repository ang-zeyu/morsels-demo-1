One of the most encouraging signs of the growth of musical taste and  understanding at the present time as regards the singing of children,  is the almost unanimous acquiescence of choirmasters, supervisors,  teachers, and others in the idea that children should sing softly, and  avoid loud and harsh tones; and the author ventures to hope that the  first edition of this book has helped, in a measure at least, to bring  about this state of opinion.    It is true that for a long time the art of training children's voices  has been well understood by choirmasters of vested choirs, and by many  others, but its basis was purely empirical.    Something more, however, than the dictum of individual taste and  judgment is needed to convince the educators of our schools of the  wisdom of any departure from established customs and practices. The  primary end, then, of the author has been to show a scientific basis for  the use of what is herein called the head-voice of the child, and to  adduce, from a study of the anatomy and physiology of the larynx and  vocal organs, safe principles for the guidance of those who teach  children to sing.    The conditions under which music is taught in schools call for an appeal  to the understanding first, and taste afterward. These conditions are:    First, the actual teaching of music is done by class-room or grade  teachers. The special teacher, who usually supervises also, visits each  room, it may be as often as once a week, but in most towns and cities  not oftener than once in three or four weeks. At any rate the class form  their ideals and habits from the daily lessons, which are given by their  grade teacher.    Second, these teachers in the great majority of cases acquire their  knowledge of music through teaching it, and must also, it can easily be  understood, develop a sense of discrimination in musical matters in the  same way. There is a strong natural tendency in the school-rooms to  emphasize the _teaching_ of music, or teaching about music, as  contrasted with actual singing. The importance of using the voice  properly will not suggest itself to many teachers.    It is necessary, then, that this, which is the essence of all  instruction in vocal music, should be brought to the attention of the  vast army of instructors in our public schools in as convincing a way as  is possible. Now the best, and in fact the only way to secure the assent  of our educators to a new idea in school work, is to prove its truth.  \"It is useless to dispute about tastes,\" and so the less said about  harsh tone to a teacher accustomed to hear it daily, and to like it,  the better; but prove to this teacher that the harsh tone is physically  hurtful to the child, and that for physiological reasons the voice  should be used softly and gently, and you have won a convert, one, too,  who will quickly recognize the aesthetic phase of the change in voice  use. The author knows from observation and experience that children in  the public schools can, under existing conditions, be taught good habits  of voice use. There are wonderful possibilities of musical development,  in the study of music in schools, and the active interest of every  musician and music lover should be exercised to the end that its  standard may be kept high.          PREFACE.      It will be generally admitted by those who are able to judge, that the  singing of children is more often disagreeable than pleasant, and yet  the charm of childhood and the effect of custom are so potent that many  who are keenly alive to any deficiency in the adult singer, listen with  tolerance, and it would seem with a degree of pleasure even, to the  harsh tones of children.    This tolerance of rough, strident singing by children is as strange as  the singing. It cannot be right for children to sing with the coarse,  harsh tone that is so common, and it is not right, although there is a  prevalent idea that such singing is natural, that is, unavoidable.    This idea is false. The child singing-voice is not rough and harsh  unless it is misused. The truth of this statement can be easily  demonstrated. If it were not true it would be difficult to justify the  teaching of vocal music in schools, or the employment of boy sopranos in  church choirs.    It seems to the author that the chief difficulty experienced by teachers  and instructors of singing, in dealing with children, lies in the  assumption, expressed or implied, that their voices are to be treated as  we treat the voices of adults-- adult women; but the vocal organs of the  child differ widely from those of the adult in structure, strength and  general character. As a consequence, there is a marked difference in  voice.    Vocal music has been very generally introduced into the schools of our  country during the past few years, and there is evidently a very general  and earnest desire that children be taught to sing. It is also the wish  of those who are teachers to do their work well.    While there are many books to aid educators upon every other subject  taught in public schools, the literature on the voice, particularly the  singing-voice, is meagre, and it is believed that some direct, practical  hints on this topic may be welcome.    The following pages are the result of several years' experience in  teaching, and of careful study of children's voices. The author has  attempted to describe the physiological characteristics of the  child-voice and to give some practical hints regarding its management.  It is sincerely hoped that what is herein written may be useful and  helpful to those engaged in teaching children to sing.      FRANCIS E. HOWARD,    Bridgeport, Conn.

Teachers followed a few good rules which had  been logically evolved from the experience of many schools of singing.    We are indebted to modern science, aided by the laryngoscope, for many  facts concerning the action of the larynx, and more especially the vocal  cords in tone-production. While the early discoveries regarding the  mechanism of the voice were hopefully believed to have solved all  problems concerning its cultivation, experience has shown the futility  of attempting to formulate a set of rules for voice-culture based alone  upon the incomplete data furnished by the laryngoscope. This instrument  is a small, round mirror which is introduced into the throat at such an  angle, that if horizontal rays of light are thrown upon it, the larynx,  which lies directly beneath, is illuminated and reflected in the mirror  at the back of the mouth-- the laryngoscope. Very many singers and  teachers, of whom Manuel Garcia was the first, have made use of this  instrument to observe the action of their vocal bands in the act of  singing, and the results of these observations are of the greatest  value. Still, as before said, the laryngoscope does not reveal all the  secrets of voice-production. While it tells unerringly of any departure  from the normal, or of pathological change in the larynx, it does not  tell whether the larynx belongs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by Cornell University Digital Collections)                    [Transcriber's Notes:    Inconsistent spellings and hyphenations such as \"re-election\" and  \"reelection\" have been conformed, and obvious typographical errors  have been corrected.

I    1774-1832      [Illustration]      NEW YORK  HENRY HOLT AND COMPANY  1906    Copyright, 1906  By  HENRY HOLT AND COMPANY          PREFACE      The preparation of this work was suggested to the author by the  difficulty he experienced in obtaining an accurate knowledge of the  movements of political parties and their leaders in the Empire State.  \"After living a dozen years in New York,\" wrote Oliver Wolcott, who  had been one of Washington's Cabinet, and was afterwards governor of  Connecticut, \"I don't pretend to comprehend their politics. It is a  labyrinth of wheels within wheels, and it is understood only by the  managers.\" Wolcott referred to the early decades of the last century,  when Clintonian and Bucktail, gradually absorbing the Federalists,  severed the old Republican party into warring factions. In later  years, Daniel S. Dickinson spoke of \"the tangled web of New York  politics\"; and Horace Greeley complained of \"the zigzag, wavering  lines and uncouth political designations which puzzled and wearied  readers\" from 1840 to 1860, when Democrats divided into Conservatives  and Radicals, Hunkers and Barnburners, and Hards and Softs; and when  Whigs were known as Conscience and Cotton, and Woollies and Silver  Grays. More recently James Parton, in his _Life of Andrew Jackson_,  speaks of \"that most unfathomable of subjects, the politics of the  State of New York.\"    There is no attempt in this history to catalogue the prominent public  men of New York State. Such a list would itself fill a volume. It has  only been possible, in the limited space given to over a century, to  linger here and there in the company of the famous figures who rose  conspicuously above their fellow men and asserted themselves  masterfully in influencing public thought and action. Indeed, the  history of a State or nation is largely the history of a few leading  men, and it is of such men only, with some of their more prominent  contemporaries, that the author has attempted to write.    It would be hard to find in any Commonwealth of the Union a more  interesting or picturesque leadership than is presented in the  political history of the Empire State. Rarely more than two  controlling spirits appear at a time, and as these pass into apogee  younger men of approved capacity are ready to take their places. None  had a meteoric rise, but in his day each became an absolute party  boss; for the Constitution of 1777, by creating the Council of  Appointment, opened wide the door to bossism. The abolition of the  Council in 1821 doubtless made individual control more difficult, but  the system left its methods so deeply impressed upon party management  that what before was done under the sanction of law, ever after  continued under the cover of custom.    After the Revolution, George Clinton and Alexander Hamilton led the  opposing political forces, and while Aaron Burr was forging to the  front, the great genius of DeWitt Clinton, the nephew of George  Clinton, began asserting itself. The defeat of Burr for governor, and  the death of Hamilton would have left DeWitt Clinton in complete  control, had he found a strong man for governor whom he could use. In  1812 Martin Van Buren discovered superiority as a manager, and for  nearly two decades, until the death of the distinguished canal  builder, his great ability was taxed to its uttermost in the memorable  contests between Bucktails and Clintonians. Thurlow Weed succeeded  DeWitt Clinton in marshalling the forces opposed to Van Buren, whose  mantle gradually fell upon Horatio Seymour. Clustered about each of  these leaders, save DeWitt Clinton, was a coterie of distinguished men  whose power of intellect has made their names familiar in American  history. If DeWitt Clinton was without their aid, it was because  strong men in high position rebelled against becoming errand boys to  do his bidding. But the builder of the Erie canal needed no  lieutenants, since his great achievement, aiding the farmer and  enriching the merchant, overcame the power of Van Buren, the  popularity of Tompkins, and the phenomenal ability of the Albany  Regency.    In treating the period from 1800 to 1830, the term \"Democrat\" is  purposely avoided, since all anti-federalist factions in New York  claimed to be \"Republican.\" The Clay electors, in the campaign of  1824, adopted the title \"Democrat Ticket,\" but in 1828, and for  several years after the formation of the Whig party in 1834, the  followers of Jackson, repudiating the title of Democrats, called  themselves Republicans.    For aid in supplying material for character and personal sketches, the  author is indebted to many \"old citizens\" whom he met during the years  he held the office of United States Attorney for the Northern District  of New York, when that district included the entire State north and  west of Albany. He takes this occasion, also, to express his deep  obligation to the faithful and courteous officials of the Library of  Congress, who, during the years he has been a member of Congress,  assisted him in searching for letters and other unindexed bits of New  York history which might throw some light upon subjects under  investigation.    The author hopes to complete the work in an additional volume,  bringing it down to the year 1896.    D.S.A.    BUFFALO, N.Y., March, 1906.          CONTENTS    VOL.

It  never lacked in the spirit of resistance to England's misrule, but it  had failed to justify the confident prophecies of those who had been  instrumental in its formation.    For nearly a year New York City saw with wonder the spectacle of a few  fearless radicals, organised into a vigilance committee of fifty,  closing the doors of a custom-house, guarding the gates of an arsenal,  embargoing vessels ladened with supplies for British troops, and  removing cannon from the Battery, while an English fleet, well  officered and manned, rode idly at"]]]
