[Map: Map showing battlefields of the Seven Years' War]    Among the great wars of history there are few, if any, instances of  so long and successfully sustained a struggle, against enormous  odds, as that of the Seven Years' War, maintained by Prussia--then  a small and comparatively insignificant kingdom--against Russia,  Austria, and France simultaneously, who were aided also by the  forces of most of the minor principalities of Germany. The  population of Prussia was not more than five millions, while that  of the Allies considerably exceeded a hundred millions. Prussia  could put, with the greatest efforts, but a hundred and fifty  thousand men into the field, and as these were exhausted she had  but small reserves to draw upon; while the Allies could, with  comparatively little difficulty, put five hundred thousand men into  the field, and replenish them as there was occasion. That the  struggle was successfully carried on, for seven years, was due  chiefly to the military genius of the king; to his indomitable  perseverance; and to a resolution that no disaster could shake, no  situation, although apparently hopeless, appall. Something was due  also, at the commencement of the war, to the splendid discipline of  the Prussian army at that time; but as comparatively few of those  who fought at Lobositz could have stood in the ranks at Torgau, the  quickness of the Prussian people to acquire military discipline  must have been great; and this was aided by the perfect confidence  they felt in their king, and the enthusiasm with which he inspired  them.    Although it was not, nominally, a war for religion, the  consequences were as great and important as those which arose from  the Thirty Years' War. Had Prussia been crushed and divided,  Protestantism would have disappeared in Germany, and the whole  course of subsequent events would have been changed. The war was  scarcely less important to Britain than to Prussia. Our close  connection with Hanover brought us into the fray; and the weakening  of France, by her efforts against Prussia, enabled us to wrest  Canada from her, to crush her rising power in India, and to obtain  that absolute supremacy at sea that we have never, since, lost. And  yet, while every school boy knows of the battles of ancient Greece,  not one in a hundred has any knowledge whatever of the momentous  struggle in Germany, or has ever as much as heard the names of the  memorable battles of Rossbach, Leuthen, Prague, Zorndorf,  Hochkirch, and Torgau. Carlyle's great work has done much to  familiarize older readers with the story; but its bulk, its  fullness of detail, and still more the peculiarity of Carlyle's  diction and style, place it altogether out of the category of books  that can be read and enjoyed by boys.    I have therefore endeavoured to give the outlines of the struggle,  for their benefit; but regret that, in a story so full of great  events, I have necessarily been obliged to devote a smaller share  than usual to the doings of my hero.    G. A. Henty.        Chapter 1: King and Marshal.      It was early in 1756 that a Scottish trader, from Edinburgh,  entered the port of Stettin. Among the few passengers was a tall  young Scotch lad, Fergus Drummond by name. Though scarcely sixteen,  he stood five feet ten in height; and it was evident, from his  broad shoulders and sinewy appearance, that his strength was in  full proportion to his height. His father had fallen at Culloden,  ten years before. The glens had been harried by Cumberland's  soldiers, and the estates confiscated. His mother had fled with him  to the hills; and had lived there, for some years, in the cottage  of a faithful clansman, whose wife had been her nurse. Fortunately,  they were sufficiently well off to be able to maintain their guests  in comfort; and indeed the presents of game, fish, and other  matters, frequently sent in by other members of the clan, had  enabled her to feel that her maintenance was no great burden on her  faithful friends.    For some years, she devoted herself to her son's education; and  then, through the influence of friends at court, she obtained the  grant of a small portion of her late husband's estates; and was  able to live in comfort, in a position more suited to her former  rank.    Fergus' life had been passed almost entirely in the open air.  Accompanied by one or two companions, sons of the clansmen, he  would start soon after daybreak and not return until sunset, when  they would often bring back a deer from the forests, or a heavy  creel of salmon or trout from the streams. His mother encouraged  him in these excursions, and also in the practice of arms. She  confined her lessons to the evening, and even after she settled on  her recovered farm of Kilgowrie, and obtained the services of a  tutor for him, she arranged that he should still be permitted to  pass the greater part of the day according to his own devices.    She herself was a cousin of the two brothers Keith; the one of  whom, then Lord Marischal, had proclaimed the Old Pretender king at  Edinburgh; and both of whom had attained very high rank abroad, the  younger Keith having served with great distinction in the Spanish  and Russian armies, and had then taken service under Frederick the  Great, from whom he had received the rank of field marshal, and was  the king's greatest counsellor and friend. His brother had joined  him there, and stood equally high in the king's favour. Although  both were devoted Jacobites, and had risked all, at the first  rising in favour of the Old Pretender, neither had taken part in  that of Charles Edward, seeing that it was doomed to failure. After  Culloden, James Keith, the field marshal, had written to his  cousin, Mrs. Drummond, as follows:    \"Dear Cousin,    \"I have heard with grief from Alexander Grahame, who has come over  here to escape the troubles, of the grievous loss that has befallen  you. He tells me that, when in hiding among the mountains, he  learned that you had, with your boy, taken refuge with Ian the  forester, whom I well remember when I was last staying with your  good husband, Sir John. He also said that your estates had been  confiscated, but that he was sure you would be well cared for by  your clansmen. Grahame told me that he stayed with you for a few  hours, while he was flying from Cumberland's bloodhounds; and that  you told him you intended to remain there, and to devote yourself  to the boy's education, until better times came.    \"I doubt not that ere long, when the hot blood that has been  stirred up by this rising has cooled down somewhat, milder measures  will be used, and some mercy be shown; but it may be long, for the  Hanoverian has been badly frightened, and the Whigs throughout the  country greatly scared, and this for the second time. I am no lover  of the usurper, but I cannot agree with all that has been said  about the severity of the punishment that has been dealt out. I  have been fighting all over Europe, and I know of no country where  a heavy reckoning would not have been made, after so serious an  insurrection. Men who take up arms against a king know that they  are staking their lives; but after vengeance comes pardon, and the  desire to heal wounds, and I trust that you will get some portion  of your estate again.    \"It is early yet to think of what you are going to make of the boy,  but I am sure you will not want to see him fighting in the  Hanoverian uniform. So, if he has a taste for adventure let him,  when the time comes, make his way out to me; or if I should be  under the sod by that time, let him go to my brother. There will,  methinks, be no difficulty in finding out where we are, for there  are so many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19715"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Norwich (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: Norwich Cathedral from the South-East.]                      THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF                     NORWICH            A DESCRIPTION OF ITS FABRIC            AND A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE                  EPISCOPAL SEE                         BY                C.H.B.

The aim of each writer has been to produce a work  compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the  student of Archaeology and History, and yet not too technical in  language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case  would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general  sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful  are:--(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in  questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2)  the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the  Transactions of the Antiquarian and Archaeological Societies; (3) the  important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master  of the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the  English Cathedrals; and (5) the very excellent series of Handbooks to  the Cathedrals originated by the late Mr John Murray; to which the  reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in  reference to the histories of the respective sees.

I would here acknowledge indebtedness and thanks due to the Very Rev.  the Dean and Mrs Sheepshanks for the personal interest they evinced, and  for his material help; to Mr J.B.

Greenslade for the loan of the drawings reproduced  under his name; as well as to the Photochrom Co. Ltd., Messrs S.B. Bolas  & Co., and Mr F.G.M. Beaumont for the use of their photographs.
