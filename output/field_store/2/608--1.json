Good gracious, Ruth, how quickly you pack! Why, I've oceans  and oceans of things yet to go into my trunk! Oh, there are my scout  shoes. I've been looking everywhere for them. I'll need them if I do any  hiking in those war scenes,\" and Alice DeVere dived under a pile of  clothing, bringing to light a muddy, but comfortable, pair of walking  shoes. \"I don't know what I'd do without them,\" she murmured.    \"Alice!\" cried Ruth, her sister, and the shocked tone of her voice made  the younger girl look up quickly from the contemplation of the shoes.    \"Why, what have I done now?\" came in rather injured accents. \"I'm sure I  didn't use any slang; and as for not having all my things packed as  quickly as you, why, Ruth, my dear, you must remember that you are an  exception--the one that proves the rule.\"    \"I didn't say you used any slang, Alice dear. Nor did I intimate that  you were behind in your packing. I'll gladly help you. But it---- Those  shoes!\" and she pointed a finger dramatically at the \"brogans,\" as Alice  sometimes called them.    \"Those shoes? What's the matter with them? They're a perfectly good  pair, as far as I can see; and they're mighty comfortable.\"    \"Oh, Alice--mighty?\"    \"Well, I can't get over using such words, especially since we heard so  many strong expressions from the sailors when we were in those sea  films. Mine sound weak now. But what's the matter with the shoes, Ruth?\"    \"They're so muddy, dear. They will soil all your pretty things if you  put them in your trunk in that condition. You don't want that, do you?\"    \"I should say not--most decidedly! Especially since pretty things with  me last about one day. I don't see how it is you keep yours so nice and  fresh, Ruth.\"    \"It's because I'm careful, dear.\"    \"Careful! Bosh! Care killed a cat, they say. I'm sure I'm careful,  too---- Oh, here's that lace collar I've been looking everywhere for!\"    She made a sudden reach for it, there was a ripping, tearing sound, and  Alice was gazing ruefully at a rent in the sleeve of her dress.    \"Oh, for the love of trading stamps!\" she ejaculated.    \"Alice!\" gasped Ruth.    \"Well, I don't care! I had to say something. Look at that rip! And I  wanted to wear this dress to-day. Oh----\"    \"That's just it, Alice,\" interrupted Ruth, in a gentle, chiding voice.  \"You are too impulsive. If you had reached for that lace less hurriedly  you wouldn't have torn your dress. And if you took care of your things  and didn't let your laces and ribbons get strewn about so, they would  last longer and look fresher. I don't want to lecture----\"    \"I know you don't, you old dear!\" and Alice leaned over--they were both  sitting on the floor in front of trunks--and made a motion as though to  embrace her sister. But a warning rip caused her to desist, and, looking  over her shoulder, she found her skirt caught on a corner of the trunk.    \"There! Did you ever?\" she cried. \"I can't even give you a  sisterly hug without pulling myself to pieces. I'm all  upset--excited--unstrung--Wellington Bunn doing Hamlet isn't to be  compared to me. I must get straightened out.\"    \"I guess that's it--you're all tangled up in your packing,\" said Ruth,  with a laugh. \"Truly, I don't mean to lecture, Alice, but you must go a  bit slower.\"    \"Not with this packing--I can't, and be ready in time. Why! you are all  prepared to go. I'll just throw the things into my trunk and----\"    \"Now, don't do that. Don't throw things in. You can put in twice as much  if you lay the things in neatly. I'll help you. But--oh, dear----!\"    Ruth made a gesture of despair.    \"What's the matter now? What are you registering?\" and Alice used the  moving picture term for depicting one of the standard emotions. The  girls were both moving picture actresses.    \"I'm trying to register dismay at the muddy state of those scout shoes,  as you call them, Alice. They may be nice and comfortable, as you say,  and really they do look so. And I have no doubt you will find them  useful if we have to do much tramping over the hills of Oak Farm.  But----\"    \"Oh, we'll have to do plenty of hiking, as Russ Dalwood warned us,\"  Alice put in. \"You know, there are to be several Civil War plays filmed,  and they didn't have automobiles or motor cycles to get about on in  those days. So we'll have to walk. And it will be over rough ground, so  I thought these shoes would be just the thing.\"    \"They will, Alice. I must get a pair myself, I think. But I was just  wondering how you got them so terribly muddy. How did you?\"    \"Oh, Paul Ardite and I were in that Central Park scene the other day.  You know, 'A Daughter of the Woods,' and some of the scenes were filmed  in the park. It was muddy, and I didn't get a chance to have the brogans  cleaned, for I had to jump from the park into the ballroom scene of 'His  Own Enemy,' and there was no time. We had to retake in that scene  because one of the extras was wearing white canvas shoes instead of  ballroom slippers, and the director didn't notice it until the film was  run out in the projection room.    \"So that accounts for the mud on the shoes, Ruth. But I suppose I can  'phone down to the janitor and have him send them out to the Italian at  the corner. He'll take the mud off.\"    \"No, I don't know that you can do that, Alice. We haven't any too much  time. If I had an old newspaper, I could wrap the shoes up in that for  you, and pack them in the bottom of your trunk. Then the mud wouldn't  soil your clothes.\"    \"An old newspaper? Here's a stack of them. Daddy just brought them from  his room. Guess he's going to throw them away.\"    Alice reached up to a table and lifted the top paper from a pile near  the edge. She opened it with a flirt of her hand and was about to wrap  the muddy shoes in it when some headlines on one page caught her  attention. She leaned eagerly forward to read them, and spent more than  a minute going over the article beneath.    \"Well,\" remarked Ruth finally, with a smile, \"if you're going to do  that, Alice, you'll never get packed. What is it that interests you?\"    \"This, about a missing girl. Why, look here, Ruth, there's a reward of  ten thousand dollars offered for news of her! Why, I don't remember  seeing this before. Look, it's quite startling. A San Francisco  girl--Mildred Passamore--mysteriously disappears while on a train bound  for Seattle--can't find any trace of her--parents distracted--they've  got detectives on the trail--going to flood the country with photographs  of her--all sorts of things feared--but think of it!--ten thousand  dollars reward!\"    \"Let me see,\" and in spite of the necessity for haste in the packing,  Ruth DeVere forgot it for the moment and came to look over her sister's  shoulder to read the account of the missing California girl.    \"It is strange,\" murmured Ruth. \"I don't remember about that. I wonder  if she could be around here? The New York police are wonderful in  working on mystery cases.\"    \"But the funny part of it is,\" said Alice, \"that I haven't noticed  anything about it in the New York papers. Have you? This is a San  Francisco paper. Naturally they'd have more about it than would the  journals here. But even the New York papers would have big accounts of  such a case, especially where such a large reward is offered.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed Ruth. \"I wonder why we haven't seen an account of it  in our papers.

It's our  lunch!\"    \"This\" was a large basket, lined with a white cloth, at the bottom of  which lay nine bread-pills. Nine boys looked down at them in rueful  disgust, and then across the school-room to where a larger group stood  chuckling mischievously, their hands and mouths filled with tempting,  crusty hunches, carved from the loaf according to fancy.    Those nine gray, unappetizing pellets represented all that was left of  the loaf; and Mason, the boy who first spoke, realizing this, flung the  big basket in a burst of indignation at the heads of the opposite clump,  one or two of whom were hit. Revenge was prompt. Ere it touched the  floor it was hurled back with vigour, but, being dodged successfully,  fell harmless to the ground.    Mason and seven others were new-comers to Brincliffe School, and when  the luncheon interval was heralded by the entrance of the loaf and the  exit of the masters, it did not occur to them to join in the general  rush that was made at the basket. And this was the sorry reward of good  manners!    The fact of the matter is that they were not merely new boys, and  therefore lawful game, but day-pupils. That was a grievance at  Brincliffe--a great grievance. It was only last term that the first  day-boy was admitted into Mr. West's establishment. More than one young  wiseacre had gloomily prophesied that Jim Bacon was the thin end of the  wedge. And now they gloated, \"Didn't we say so?\"    It is not easy to see at once what objection there could be to certain  boys attending the school and yet sleeping in their own homes. But a  rooted objection there undoubtedly was--all the stronger, perhaps,  because no valid reason for it could be stated.    Now for a few moments words took the place of missiles.    \"You--you greedy, giggling gobblers--you!\" This was from Mason, and he  was hungry. The \"g's\" came out in slow, studied jerks.    \"And what are you, pray? A pack of pretty poppets! Mammy's darlings!  Must go home to by-by, mustn't you?\" Sneering was Joe Green's forte.    Words failed Mason, but a small black-eyed lad, called Lewis Simmons,  took up the cudgels in his stead.    \"I'd rather be a pretty poppet than an ugly chimpanzee like--_some_  people!\"    \"Hold your tongue, baby! Cheek me again, and you'll get smacked. We must  see that all you duckies go to bed at twelve for a little nap. You shall  have a nice beauty-sleep, you shall!\"    \"Don't answer! Swallow it down!\" muttered Jack Brady, laying his hand on  Simmons's shoulder. \"Let 'em have the last word if they're stuck on it.  We're only wasting breath.\"    \"It's all very well, Brady, but they have treated us abominably! We'd  done nothing to them.\" Ethelbert Hughes, who said this in a low voice,  was Simmons's special chum, though a great contrast, being tall and  fair, with a gentle, quiet manner.    \"Still, there's nothing gained by bandying names,\" returned Brady. \"And  it isn't even amusing to listen to. A fellow's seldom funny and furious  at the same time.    \"I don't care about words,\" said Mason, giving a fierce kick to the  basket. \"I'm quite ready to bandy thumps, if they prefer it. But they  deserve trouncing in some way for a caddish trick like this.\"    \"It was a bit rough on us, but they only meant it as a joke,\" persisted  Brady. \"We must pay them back in joke, and then it'll be all right.\"    \"Will it?\" growled Bacon. \"I know better. Why, they hate day-boys like  poison, and they'll let you all feel it too. I had a nice dose of it  last term, and I'm jolly glad there are some more of you to share it  with me this time.\"    \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said a boy called Armitage. \"And are they all  such donkeys as to care whether we sleep here or not?\"    \"They're all such sheep as to follow the same track blindly, and not  dare to act on their own hook,\" replied Bacon. \"It's the fashion to run  down day-boys, that's all. But it's a beastly shame, and I almost wish  West hadn't let me in.\"    \"Oh, rubbish!\" said Brady. \"Fashions change quickly. We'll have a  ripping time, in spite of everybody.\"    Meanwhile the boarders were discussing matters from their point of view.    \"It's just what I expected,\" said Norman Hallett, a tall, well-built  boy, who was the eldest in the school. \"Once open the door--only a  chink--and in pours the whole town.\" He waved a half-eaten crust to  illustrate the pouring in.    \"West had better drop the name of Brincliffe, and call us Elmridge  Grammar School at once. That's what we are now,\" observed Green.    \"I don't mind so much about that,\" said a grave-faced boy, whose name  was Vickers; \"but what I do hate is the way day-boys spoil everything.  It can't be helped, but nothing's ever fair or equal when once day-boys  get mixed up with a school. I'll tell you exactly what happens.  First\"--and here the speaker laid his forefinger on his thumb to mark  the order--\"First, they're always trying to make you green with envy by  talking about the jolly things they're going to. Second, they're  continually getting holidays for themselves on some pretence or other.  Third, they love to pity you, and declare they'd shoot themselves rather  than be regular boarders. Fourth, they buy cribs and keys, and keep them  at home, and get help from their fathers, and work extra hours, and  spoil your chance of a prize altogether. Fifth, they're for ever  sniggering over private jokes about people you neither know nor want  to--\"    \"Hold, Vickers, my dear chap!\" broke in Cadbury, the school jester. \"It  pains me to check the fluency of our golden-mouthed orator, but I've  been waiting in vain for 'Finally'. Let's have an innings. What I object  to is that they're such a horrid lot. Cocky to a degree--simply think  no end of themselves--and lose their hair altogether at the first little  playful joke. I think the beastly way in which they took that bread game  spoke for itself. I should like to have hammered them for that.\"    \"West will be changing all our hours and classes soon to suit the  convenience of the day-boarders. That'll be the next move. I know it,  because I heard him ask that gawky chap they call Mason if he could stay  on Wednesday evenings for the dancing class. If he could, indeed! That's  the way they're going to be treated.\"    \"If they are, it'll be war to the knife between us and them,\" observed  Hallett, folding his arms with an air of conscious might.    \"War wiz knife, Hallett? Ah!\"    It was a black-browed foreign child of nine who whispered these words,  creeping close to Hallett, and gazing up curiously into his face.  Hallett burst out laughing.    \"Listen to this bloodthirsty brigand of a March Hare! The instinct of  his ancestors is strong within him. No, Harey,\" he continued, \"I won't  stickle for knives, or even pistols. Shall we call it war to the fist?  Anything will do, so long as it's war.\"    \"What do you all think of the weekly? Is he as bad as the rest?\" asked  Grey, one of the juniors. He was always careful to find out what he  ought to think before he thought it.    [Illustration]    \"Which is the weakly one?\" asked Cadbury. \"That lily-flower bending on  its stalk to address the cheeky, black-eyed imp? He looks weakly enough,  all eyes and hair.\"    \"No, no; that's Hughes, from the Bank. I mean the new weekly boarder,  who's to go home from Saturday to Monday.\"    \"I know the one,\" said Hallett. \"The apple-faced boy who does so much  laughing. I heard someone call him Brady.\"    \"Oh, that fellow! He doesn't look so bad,\" pronounced Trevelyan, who  ranked only second to Hallett.    \"He seems to have a strong sense of humour,\" remarked Vickers gravely,  at which his comrades giggled. Vickers was commonly believed to have  none. He never laughed when anyone else did.    \"A weekly boarder is a very different thing from a day-boy,\" Hallett  went on. \"If Brady was wise he wouldn't go mixing himself up with that  lot. I shall give him a wrinkle when he comes my way. He really looks  rather decent, and he was the only one who grinned about the bread. Of  course it may have been from sheer force of habit, and therefore no  credit to him; but still, he did grin.\"    At this moment the discussion in both camps was brought to a sudden  finish by the return of the masters. The chief himself, Mr. West, was  the first to enter, and his eye was immediately caught by the bread  basket, which lay dejected on its side in a little pool of crumbs. He  looked suspiciously at it.    \"Who threw the basket on the floor?\"    Dead silence.    \"Come, speak out! Someone must have done it; baskets don't jump off  tables by themselves.\"    After another short silence, one of the young day-pupils, who happened  to be standing close beside it, picked up the basket and placed it on  the table.    \"Did you knock it down, Frere, my boy?\" asked Mr. West.    \"No, sir. It was one of the boarders; I don't know his name. I think he  aimed it at some of us, and it fell on the floor instead.\"    Frere"]]]
