Spring    A man under thirty needs neighbors and to stop up the current of his  life with a long silence is like obstructing a river--eventually the  water either sweeps away the dam or rises over it, and the stronger the  dam the more destructive is that final rush to freedom. Vic Gregg was on  the danger side of thirty and he lived alone in the mountains all  that winter. He wanted to marry Betty Neal, but marriage means money,  therefore Vic contracted fifteen hundred dollars' worth of mining for  the Duncans, and instead of taking a partner he went after that stake  single handed. He is a very rare man who can turn out that amount of  labor in a single season, but Gregg furnished that exception which  establishes the rule: he did the assessment work on fourteen claims and  almost finished the fifteenth, yet he paid the price. Week after week  his set of drills was wife and child to him, and for conversation he had  only the clangor of the four-pound single-jack on the drill heads, with  the crashing of the \"shots\" now and then as periods to the chatter  of iron on iron. He kept at it, and in the end he almost finished the  allotted work, but for all of it he paid in full.    The acid loneliness ate into him. To be sure, from boyhood he knew the  mountain quiet, the still heights and the solemn echoes, but towards the  close of the long isolation the end of each day found him oppressed by  a weightier sense of burden; in a few days he would begin to talk to  himself.    From the first the evening pause after supper hurt him most, for a  man needs a talk as well as tobacco, and after a time he dreaded these  evenings so bitterly that he purposely spent himself every day, so as  to pass from supper into sleep at a stride. It needed a long day to  burn out his strength thoroughly, so he set his rusted alarm-clock, and  before dawn it brought him groaning out of the blankets to cook a hasty  breakfast and go slowly up to the tunnel. In short, he wedded himself to  his work; he stepped into a routine which took the place of thought, and  the change in him was so gradual that he did not see the danger.    A mirror might have shown it to him as he stood this morning at the door  of his lean-to, for the wind fluttered the shirt around his labor-dried  body, and his forehead puckered in a frown, grown habitual. It was a  narrow face, with rather close-set eyes and a slanted forehead which  gave token of a single-track mind, a single-purposed nature with one  hundred and eighty pounds of strong sinews and iron-hard muscle to give  it significance. Such was Vic Gregg as he stood at the door waiting for  the coffee he had drunk to brush away the cobwebs of sleep, and then he  heard the eagle scream.    A great many people have never heard the scream of an eagle. The only  voice they connect with the kind of the air is a ludicrously feeble  squawk, dim with distance, but in his great moments the eagle has a  war-cry like that of the hawk, but harsher, hoarser, tenfold in volume.  This sound cut into the night in the gulch, and Vic Gregg started and  glanced about for echoes made the sound stand at his side; then he  looked up, and saw two eagles fighting in the light of the morning. He  knew what it meant--the beginning of the mating season, and these two  battling for a prize. They darted away. They flashed together with  reaching talons and gaping beaks, and dropped in a tumult of wings,  then soared and clashed once more until one of them folded his wings and  dropped bulletlike out of the morning into the night. Close over Gregg's  head, the wings flirted out--ten feet from tip to tip--beat down with  a great washing sound, and the bird shot across the valley in a level  flight. The conqueror screamed a long insult down the hollow. For a  while he balanced, craning his bald head as if he sought applause, then,  without visible movement of his wings, sailed away over the peaks. A  feather fluttered slowly down past Vic Gregg.    He looked down to it, and rubbed the ache out of the back of his  neck. All about him the fresh morning was falling; yonder shone a  green-mottled face of granite, and there a red iron blow-out streaked  with veins of glittering silicate, and in this corner, still misted with  the last delicate shades of night, glimmered rhyolite, lavender-pink.  The single-jack dropped from the hand of Gregg, and his frown relaxed.    When he stretched his arms, the cramps of labor unkinked and let the  warm blood flow, swiftly, and in the pleasure of it he closed his eyes  and drew a luxurious breath. He stepped from the door with his, head  high and his heart lighter, and when his hobnailed shoe clinked on the  fallen hammer he kicked it spinning from his path. That act brought a  smile into his eyes, and he sauntered to the edge of the little plateau  and looked down into the wide chasm of the Asper Valley.    Blue shadows washed across it, though morning shone around Gregg on the  height, and his glance dropped in a two-thousand-foot plunge to a single  yellow eye that winked through the darkness, a light in the trapper's  cabin. But the dawn was falling swiftly now, and while Gregg lingered  the blue grew thin, purple-tinted, and then dark, slender points pricked  up, which he knew to be the pines. Last of all, he caught the sheen of  grass.    Around him pressed a perfect silence, the quiet of night holding over  into the day, yet he cast a glance behind him as he heard a voice.  Indeed, he felt that some one approached him, some one for whom he had  been waiting, yet it was a sad expectancy, and more like homesickness  than anything he knew.    \"Aw, hell,\" said Vic Gregg, \"it's spring.\"    A deep-throated echo boomed back at him, and the sound went down the  gulch, three times repeated.    \"Spring,\" repeated Gregg more softly, as if he feared to rouse that  echo, \"damned if it ain't!\"    He shrugged his shoulders and turned resolutely towards the lean-to,  picking up the discarded hammer on the way. By instinct he caught it  at exactly the right balance for his strength and arm, and the handle,  polished by his grip, played with an oiled, frictionless movement  against the callouses of his palm. From the many hours of drilling,  fingers crooked, he could only straighten them by a painful effort. A  bad hand for cards, he decided gloomily, and still frowning over this he  reached the door. There he paused in instant repugnance, for the place  was strange to him.    In thought and wish he was even now galloping Grey Molly over the grass  along the Asper, and he had to wrench himself into the mood of the  patient miner. There lay his blankets, rumpled, brown with dirt, and  he shivered at sight of them; the night had been cold. Before he fell  asleep, he had flung the magazine into the corner and now the wind  rustled its torn, yellowed pages in a whisper that spoke to Gregg of the  ten-times repeated stories, tales of adventure, drifts of tobacco smoke  in gaming halls, the chant of the croupier behind the wheel, deep voices  of men, laughter of pretty girls, tatoo of running horses, shouts which  only redeye can inspire. He sniffed the air; odor of burned bacon and  coffee permeated the cabin. He turned to the right and saw his discarded  overalls with ragged holes at the knees; he turned to the left and  looked into the face of the rusted alarm clock. Its quick, soft ticking  sent an ache of weariness through him.    \"What's wrong with me,\" muttered Gregg. Even that voice seemed ghostly  loud in the cabin, and he shivered again. \"I must be going nutty.\"    As if to escape from his own thoughts, he stepped out into the sun  again, and it was so grateful to him after the chill shadow in the  lean-to, that he looked up, smiling, into the sky. A west wind urged a  scattered herd of clouds over the peaks, tumbled masses of white which  puffed into transparent silver at the edges, and behind, long wraiths of  vapor marked the path down which they had traveled. Such an old cowhand  as Vic Gregg could not fail to see the forms of cows and heavy-necked  bulls and running calves in that drift of clouds. About this season the  boys would be watching the range for signs of screw worms in the cattle,  and the bog-riders must have their hands full dragging out cows which  had fled into the mud to escape the heel flies. With a new lonesomeness  he drew his eyes down to the mountains.    Ordinarily, strange fancies never entered the hard head of Gregg, but  today it seemed to him that the mountains found a solemn companionship  in each other.    Out of the horizon, where the snowy forms glimmered in the blue, they  marched in loose order down to the valley of the Asper, where some  of them halted in place, huge cliffs, and others stumbled out into  foothills, but the main range swerved to the east beside the valley,  eastward out of his vision, though he knew that they went on to the town  of Alder.    Alder was Vic Gregg's Athens and Rome in one, its schoolhouse his  Acropolis, and Captain Lorrimer's saloon his Forum. Other people talked  of larger cities, but Alder satisfied the imagination of Vic; besides,  Grey Molly was even now in the blacksmith's pasture, and Betty Neal was  teaching in the school. Following the march of the mountains and the  drift of the clouds, he turned towards Alder. The piled water shook the  dam, topped it, burst it into fragments, and rushed into freedom; he  must go to Alder, have a drink, shake hands with a friend, kiss Betty  Neal, and come back again. Two days going, two days coming, three days  for the frolic; a week would cover it all. And two hours later Vic Gregg  had cached his heavier equipment, packed his necessaries on the burro,  and was on the way.    By noon he had dropped below the snowline and into the foothills, and  with every step his heart grew lighter. Behind him the mountains slid  up into the heart of the sky "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18971"],[0,"Jacobean Embroidery: Its Forms and Fillings, Including Late Tudor (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net/)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

INTRODUCTION      To redeem the monotony of plain surfaces has ever been the aim of all  the arts, but especially that of the needle, which being the oldest  expression of decorative intention, has, from the earliest time, been  very dependent on its groundwork for its ultimate results. This is  particularly the case in embroideries of the type of what is commonly  known as Jacobean, where the ground fabric is extensively visible, as it  is also in that wondrous achievement, the Bayeux tapestry worked in  coarse wools upon homespun linen and therefore quite miscalled  \"tapestry.\"    Inaccuracy in nomenclature is one of the stumbling blocks the student  encounters, and the tendency of the day to classify \"styles\" by the  restricted formula of monarchical periods is likewise misleading. No  style is ever solely distinctive of one reign, or even one century, the  law of evolution rules the arts as it does nature, there is always a  correlation between styles in art and circumstances of existence that is  productive of gradual changes of taste, therefore, pronounced evidences  in design are, actually, the culminating point in a course of combined  influences which have reached the period of individual expression.    Crewel work of the type of Jacobean, was the outcome of that earlier  wool embroidery that even in the zenith of fame of the Ecclesiastical  broderers still quietly went on its way.    In the middle ages, furnishing of rooms was scanty, and embroidered  hangings, cushion and stool covers provided the necessary notes of  colour and comfort; the wall hangings of the 13th century were of coarse  canvas decorated with a design executed in wools.    It is curious how in English embroideries there has always been a  predilection on the part of the designers for interlacing stems, and for  the inconsequent introduction of birds and beasts.    Mons de Farcy, author of _La Broderie du Onzieme siecle jusqu'a nos  jours_, remarks that \"it seems that the position of England, surrounded  by the sea on all sides, has provoked in its inhabitants the passion of  travelling over the sea, and they came to know, before continental  nations, of the parrots and other birds of brilliant plumage so often  reproduced in their needlework.\"[1]    Mrs. Christie, an English authority on Embroidery, admirably sums up the  evolution of designs when she writes \"Examination of old Embroideries  gathered from all parts of the world shows that each individual  specimen, every flower and bud, is a development of some existing form,  and is not an original creation, invented, as some appear to think all  designs are, upon the spur of the moment.\" In the creation of a design  it is a case of assimilation of the fittest and the elimination of the  unsuitable from existing examples, thus the interlacing stems of the  work of the 14th century became grafted on to the version of the Tree of  Life idea in the Oriental designs that came to England in the 16th,  through the intercourse opened up by the formation of the East India  Company, at the end of Elizabeth's reign.    To deem, as do some writers, the bold, rather ponderous crewel work of  the 17th century, sole outcome of the importation of the Palampores of  Musulipatan, is to ignore all the tendencies manifested in the  embroideries of previous centuries; in the same way, to repudiate the  emblematical significance of special features markedly introduced into  old designs, is to betray a complete lack of knowledge of the mind and  manners of the people of superstitious days.    Knowledge was not rapidly acquired, and even as late as the 17th century  was largely disseminated through the country by allegorical narratives,  while emblematical lore reflected the history of the immediate moment.  There was in the poetry and in the embroidery of Elizabeth's day, a  sportive quality which was not likely to be checked under the Stuarts,  _doubles entendres_ were not confined to jests! and the political and  religious differences of opinion, rampant throughout the period, found  expression in the most fantastic ways.    The Stump Embroidery, in vogue at the same time as the crewel hangings  specially treated in this volume, was full of symbolism, and naturally  the same inspiration directed the worker in crewels. Curiously enough,  both these very different types of needlework, crystalised into  individuality concurrently, yet one is usually designated Jacobean, the  other referred to as Stuart. In this connection it is well also to  remember, that the Stuart era extended, historically, from 1603 to 1714,  _viz._, from the reign of James I (Jacobus) to that of Queen Anne,  daughter of James II.    Queen Anne is so often relegated, in the public mind, to an isolated  position, genealogically, and the pronounced developments in the changes  of taste that took place at the commencement of the of the 18th century,  left such a very definite impression, that she is rarely remembered as a  Stuart; it was in her reign, however, that the vogue for the old crewel  embroideries revived, and though differences of treatment crept in, the  designs, were, in the main, purely Jacobean, being copies or  adaptations of patterns popular in the middle of the 17th century. It is  these copies that exist mostly to-day, few, indeed, are those hangings  which pertain to the earlier date, but a study of those few, taken in  conjunction with the still fewer that remain of the 16th century, prove  the _gradual_ growth of the designs that have the tree motif which makes  them all kin.    Lady Brougham and Vaux had a most wonderful collection, from which  interesting comparisons could be made. One pair of bed hangings, of  coarse linen of the 16th century, show the trees with a meandering  growth entirely characteristic of those of heavier kind which appear in  later embroideries, these trees also are undoubtedly intended to  represent the Tree of Life, for round one is coiled a serpent, while  beneath the scanty but large leaved boughs, incidents in the story of  the expulsion from Paradise are to be descried, as also the procession  into the ark.    The work is without doubt early, for there is a primitive character in  the arrangement of the inconsequent groups of figures, Adam and Eve  stand nude either side the tree, couples in weird though contemporaneous  costume to the work are dotted over the surface quite at haphazard.    The similarity between the tree on these curtains and on one of the 18th  century once in the same collection is very striking. Added grace of  design has beautified the later work, but the same forms can be traced  and the same parrots and squirrels are introduced, the Biblical story at  the foot of the 16th century curtain has been replaced by a portion of  the legend of the human soul.    Another very interesting example I have seen, attributed to the years of  James I's reign, seems to suggest that the worker had realised the  \"waves\" in an Eastern pattern and made growths of coral at the base of  the tree, but had then converted a line or two of waves into _terra  firma_, for at one end reposes a lion, towards which a stag is bounding  with head turned back as if in fear of pursuers.    The birds in this example are very tropical, a miniature peacock on the  lower branches spreads its tail stiffly, parrots like the one  illustrated in our collection of details, birds of"]]]
