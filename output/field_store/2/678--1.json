Into the Primitive               \"Old longings nomadic leap,            Chafing at custom's chain;            Again from its brumal sleep            Wakens the ferine strain.\"    Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble  was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong  of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego.  Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal,  and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the  find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted  dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by  which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.    Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge  Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden  among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide  cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by  gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and  under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on  even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables,  where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants'  cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors,  green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping  plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge  Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot  afternoon.    And over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he  had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other  dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did  not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived  obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the  Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,--strange creatures that  rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand,  there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped  fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them  and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.    But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his.  He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons;  he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long twilight  or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet  before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge's grandsons on his  back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through  wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even  beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the  terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly  ignored, for he was king,--king over all creeping, crawling, flying  things of Judge Miller's place, humans included.    His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge's inseparable  companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was  not so large,--he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,--for his  mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred  and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good  living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right  royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived  the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even  a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of  their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere  pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down  the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing  races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.    And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the  Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.  But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel,  one of the gardener's helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel  had one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his  gambling, he had one besetting weakness--faith in a system; and this  made his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while  the wages of a gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and  numerous progeny.    The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association, and the  boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of  Manuel's treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard  on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a  solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known  as College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between  them.    \"You might wrap up the goods before you deliver 'm,\" the stranger said  gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck's neck  under the collar.    \"Twist it, an' you'll choke 'm plentee,\" said Manuel, and the stranger  grunted a ready affirmative.    Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an  unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to  give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the ends  of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands, he growled menacingly.  He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to  intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope tightened around  his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he sprang at the man,  who met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft  twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope tightened mercilessly,  while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and  his great chest panting futilely. Never in all his life had he been so  vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. But his  strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was  flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.    The next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and  that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse  shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He  had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of  riding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the  unbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but  Buck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they  relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.    \"Yep, has fits,\" the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the  baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. \"I'm  takin' 'm up for the boss to 'Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks  that he can cure 'm.\"    Concerning that night's ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself,  in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front.    \"All I get is fifty for it,\" he grumbled; \"an' I wouldn't do it over for  a thousand, cold cash.\"    His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser leg  was ripped from knee to ankle.    \"How much did the other mug get?\" the saloon-keeper demanded.    \"A hundred,\" was the reply. \"Wouldn't take a sou less, so help me.\"    \"That makes a hundred and fifty,\" the saloon-keeper calculated; \"and  he's worth it, or I'm a squarehead.\"    The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated  hand. \"If I don't get the hydrophoby--\"    \"It'll be because you was born to hang,\" laughed the saloon-keeper.  \"Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,\" he added.    Dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life  half throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But he  was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the  heavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed, and he  was flung into a cagelike crate.    There he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath and  wounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did they  want with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent up in  this narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by the  vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night he  sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see the  Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face of  the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow  candle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck's throat was  twisted into a savage growl.    But the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men entered  and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for they were  evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at  them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks at him, which  he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what  they wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be  lifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he was imprisoned,  began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the express office took  charge of him; he was carted about in another wagon; a truck"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Priory Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net            [Illustration: THE INTERIOR FROM THE ORGAN GALLERY.                 _E.

My  thanks are due, in the first place, to the Rev. W. F. G. Sandwith,  Rector of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, and the lay custodians of the  church, for the facilities which have allowed me to examine the building  in all its parts, and for the readiness with which they have given  information, not accessible elsewhere, on various points of its history  and architecture. In this matter, besides more personal obligations, I  feel that I owe much, in common with many others, to Mr. E. A. Webb, the  active member of the Restoration Committee, for the suggestive data of  his open lectures, and for the interesting expositions of the fabric by  which he has always supplemented them. Others to whom I am indebted are  Dom Henry Norbert Birt, O.S.B., of Downside Abbey, and Mr. Charles W. F.  Goss, Librarian to the Bishopsgate Institute, for their skilful guidance  in the literature of the subject; Mr. F. C. Eeles, Secretary to the  Alcuin Club, for the Elizabethan Inventory and account of the Mediaeval  Bells; and Messrs. Wm. Hill and Son, the famous builders, for  particulars of the organ.    For the illustration of the book, Mr. A. Russell Baker has kindly  contributed a selection from his rare set of old engravings, before  presenting the whole to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.    The photographic views of the church and monuments, as seen at the  present day, were taken by Mr. Edgar Scamell, of 120, Crouch Hill; and  the seal-impressions by Mr. A. P. Ready, the British Museum artist.  Finally, Sir Aston Webb, R.A., has to be thanked for the ground-plans of  the church and monastic buildings; and Mr. G. H. Smith for the plan and  dimensions of St. Bartholomew-the-Less.    A list of books and papers is appended for the benefit of students  anxious for more detailed information than could be included here.

Dugdale's \"Monasticon Anglicanum\" (edit. Bandinel, Caley, and       Sir Henry Ellis) is indispensable to the student. The sixth       volume (p. 291 _sqq_.) contains an account of the Smithfield       Foundation, and (p. 37 _sqq_.) the Rule for Austin Canons. For       the latter the reader will do well to consult also R. Duellius'       \"Antiqua Statuta Canonicorum S. Augustini metrice cum glossulis       optimis,\" and \"Regula Canonicorum Regularium per Hugonem de S.       Victore Commentario declarata.\"     For illustrative matter during the Tudor period reference may       be made to \"The Elizabethan Religious Settlement,\" by Dom Henry       Norbert Birt, O.S.B., 1907; the Rev. C. F. Raymund Palmer's       \"Articles, chiefly on the Friars Preachers of England,       reprinted from archaeological journals, 1878-85\"; and \"Obituary       Notices of the Friars Preachers or Dominicans of the English       Province.\" 1884.     The literary work of Fr. Perrin (the Marian Prior) is described       in Charles Dodd's \"Church History of England\" (1727 edition),       and Pit's \"De Illust. Scriptoribus Angliae.\"     Besides the invaluable \"Historia Anglorum\" of Matthew Paris       (ed. Sir F. Madden), and Stow's \"Survey of London\" (ed. John       Strype), the following books may be found useful:     \"Repertorium, or History of the Diocese of London.\" Richard       Newcourt. 1708.     \"New View of London.\" Edward Hatton. 1708.     \"New Remarks of London: by the Company of Parish Clerks.\" 1732.     \"London and its Environs described.\" R. and J.
