His name was  Aqa Muhammad-i-Qa'ini, and later on he would receive, from the  Manifestation, the title of Nabil-i-Akbar.(1) This eminent soul became the  leading member of the mujtahid's company of disciples. Singled out from  among them all, he alone was given the rank of mujtahid--for the late  _Sh_ay_kh_ Murtada was never wont to confer this degree.    He excelled not only in theology but in other branches of knowledge, such  as the humanities, the philosophy of the Illuminati, the teachings of the  mystics and of the _Sh_ay_kh_i School. He was a universal man, in himself  alone a convincing proof. When his eyes were opened to the light of Divine  guidance, and he breathed in the fragrances of Heaven, he became a flame  of God. Then his heart leapt within him, and in an ecstasy of joy and  love, he roared out like leviathan in the deep.    With praises showered upon him, he received his new rank from the  mujtahid. He then left Najaf and came to Ba_gh_dad, and here he was  honored with meeting Baha'u'llah. Here he beheld the light that blazed on  Sinai in the Holy Tree. Soon he was in such a state that he could rest  neither day nor night.    One day, on the floor of the outer apartments reserved for the men, the  honored Nabil was reverently kneeling in the presence of Baha'u'llah. At  that moment Haji Mirza Hasan-'Amu, a trusted associate of the mujtahids of  Karbila, came in with Zaynu'l-Abidin _Kh_an, the Fa_kh_ru'd-Dawlih.  Observing how humbly and deferentially Nabil was kneeling there, the Haji  was astonished.    \"Sir,\" he murmured, \"what are you doing in this place?\"    Nabil answered, \"I came here for the same reason you did.\"    The two visitors could not recover from their surprise, for it was widely  known that this personage was unique among mujtahids and was the most  favored disciple of the renowned _Sh_ay_kh_ Murtada.    Later, Nabil-i-Akbar left for Persia and went on to _Kh_urasan. The Amir  of Qa'in--Mir Alam _Kh_an--showed him every courtesy at first, and greatly  valued his company. So marked was this that people felt the Amir was  captivated by him, and indeed he was spellbound at the scholar's  eloquence, knowledge, and accomplishments. One can judge, from this, what  honors were accorded to Nabil by the rest, for \"men follow the faith of  their kings.\"    Nabil spent some time thus esteemed and in high favor, but the love he had  for God was past all concealing. It burst from his heart, flamed out and  consumed its coverings.    A thousand ways I tried  My love to hide--  But how could I, upon that blazing pyre  Not catch fire!    He brought light to the Qa'in area and converted a great number of people.  And when he had become known far and wide by this new name, the clergy,  envious and malevolent, arose, and informed against him, sending their  calumnies on to Tihran, so that Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah rose up in wrath.  Terrified of the _Sh_ah, the Amir attacked Nabil with all his might. Soon  the whole city was in an uproar, and the populace, lashed to fury, turned  upon him.    That enraptured lover of God never gave way, but withstood them all. At  last, however, they drove him out--drove out that man who saw what they did  not--and he went up to Tihran, where he was a fugitive, and homeless.    Here, his enemies struck at him again. He was pursued by the watchmen;  guards looked everywhere for him, asking after him in every street and  alley, hunting him down to catch and torture him. Hiding, he would pass by  them like the sigh of the oppressed, and rise to the hills; or again, like  the tears of the wronged, he would slip down into the valleys. He could no  longer wear the turban denoting his rank; he disguised himself, putting on  a layman's hat, so that they would fail to recognize him and would let him  be.    In secret, with all his powers he kept on spreading the Faith and setting  forth its proofs, and was a guiding lamp to many souls. He was exposed to  danger at all times, always vigilant and on his guard. The Government  never gave up its search for him, nor did the people cease from discussing  his case.    He left, then, for Bu_kh_ara and I_sh_qabad, continuously teaching the  Faith in those regions. Like a candle, he was using up his life; but in  spite of his sufferings he was never dispirited, rather his joy and ardor  increased with every passing day. He was eloquent of speech; he was a  skilled physician, a remedy for every ill, a balm to every sore. He would  guide the Illuminati by their own philosophical principles, and with the  mystics he would prove the Divine Advent in terms of \"inspiration\" and the  \"celestial vision.\" He would convince the _Sh_ay_kh_i leaders by quoting  the very words of their late Founders, _Sh_ay_kh_ Ahmad and Siyyid Kazim,  and would convert Islamic theologians with texts from the Qur'an and  traditions from the Imams, who guide mankind aright. Thus he was an  instant medicine to the ailing, and a rich bestowal to the poor.    He became penniless in Bu_kh_ara and a prey to many troubles, until at the  last, far from his homeland, he died, hastening away to the Kingdom where  no poverty exists.    Nabil-i-Akbar was the author of a masterly essay demonstrating the truth  of the Cause, but the friends do not have it in hand at the present time.  I hope that it will come to light, and will serve as an admonition to the  learned. It is true that in this swiftly passing world he was the target  of countless woes; and yet, all those generations of powerful clerics,  those _sh_ay_kh_s like Murtada and Mirza Habibu'llah and  Ayatu'llah-i-_Kh_urasani and Mulla Asadu'llah-i-Mazandarani--all of them  will disappear without a trace. They will leave no name behind them, no  sign, no fruit. No word will be passed down from any of them; no man will  tell of them again. But because he stood steadfast in this holy Faith,  because he guided souls and served this Cause and spread its fame, that  star, Nabil, will shine forever from the horizon of abiding light.    It is clear that whatever glory is gained outside the Cause of God turns  to abasement at the end; and ease and comfort not met with on the path of  God are finally but care and sorrow; and all such wealth is penury, and  nothing more.    A sign of guidance, he was, an emblem of the fear of God. For this Faith,  he laid down his life, and in dying, triumphed. He passed by the world and  its rewards; he closed his eyes to rank and wealth; he loosed himself from  all such chains and fetters, and put every worldly thought aside. Of wide  learning, at once a mujtahid, a philosopher, a mystic, and gifted with  intuitive sight, he was also an accomplished man of letters and an orator  without a peer. He had a great and universal mind.    Praise be to God, at the end he was made the recipient of heavenly grace.  Upon him be the glory of God, the All-Glorious. May God shed the  brightness of the Abha Kingdom upon his resting-place. May God welcome him  into the Paradise of reunion, and shelter him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#1)"],[1,"Promised Day Is Come      by Shoghi Effendi          Edition 1, (September 2006)                                       BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.

Nor does Baha'u'llah claim  finality for His own Revelation, but rather stipulates that a fuller  measure of the truth He has been commissioned by the Almighty to vouchsafe  to humanity, at so critical a juncture in its fortunes, must needs be  disclosed at future stages in the constant and limitless evolution of  mankind.    The Baha'i Faith upholds the unity of God, recognizes the unity of His  Prophets, and inculcates the principle of the oneness and wholeness of the  entire human race. It proclaims the necessity and the inevitability of the  unification of mankind, asserts that it is gradually approaching, and  claims that nothing short of the transmuting spirit of God, working  through His chosen Mouthpiece in this day, can ultimately succeed in  bringing it about. It, moreover, enjoins upon its followers the primary  duty of an unfettered search after truth, condemns all manner of prejudice  and superstition, declares the purpose of religion to be the promotion of  amity and concord, proclaims its essential harmony with science, and  recognizes it as the foremost agency for the pacification and the orderly  progress of human society....    Mirza Husayn-'Ali, surnamed Baha'u'llah (the Glory of God), a native of  Mazindaran, Whose advent the Bab [Herald and Forerunner of Baha'u'llah]  had foretold, ... was imprisoned in Tihran, was banished, in 1852, from  His native land to Ba_gh_dad, and thence to Constantinople and Adrianople,  and finally to the prison city of Akka, where He remained incarcerated for  no less than twenty-four years, and in whose neighborhood He passed away  in 1892. In the course of His banishment, and particularly in Adrianople  and Akka, He formulated the laws and ordinances of His Dispensation,  expounded, in over a hundred volumes, the principles of His Faith,  proclaimed His Message to the kings and rulers of both the East and the  West, both Christian and Muslim, addressed the Pope, the Caliph of Islam,  the Chief Magistrates of the Republics of the American continent, the  entire Christian sacerdotal order, the leaders of _Sh_i'ih and Sunni  Islam, and the high priests of the Zoroastrian religion. In these writings  He proclaimed His Revelation, summoned those whom He addressed to heed His  call and espouse His Faith, warned them of the consequences of their  refusal, and denounced, in some cases, their arrogance and tyranny....    The Faith which this order serves, safeguards and promotes is ...  essentially supernatural, supranational, entirely non-political,  non-partisan, and diametrically opposed to any policy or school of thought  that seeks to exalt any particular race, class or nation. It is free from  any form of ecclesiasticism, has neither priesthood nor rituals, and is  supported exclusively by voluntary contributions made by its avowed  adherents. Though loyal to their respective governments, though imbued  with the love of their own country, and anxious to promote at all times,  its best interests, the followers of the Baha'i Faith, nevertheless,  viewing mankind as one entity, and profoundly attached to its vital  interests, will not hesitate to subordinate every particular interest, be  it personal, regional or national, to the over-riding interests of the  generality of mankind, knowing full well that in a world of interdependent  peoples and nations the advantage of the part is best to be reached by the  advantage of the whole, and that no lasting result can be achieved by any  of the component parts if the general interests of the entity itself are  neglected....    --Shoghi Effendi            THE PROMISED DAY IS COME      Friends and fellow-heirs of the Kingdom of Baha'u'llah:    A tempest, unprecedented in its violence, unpredictable in its course,  catastrophic in its immediate effects, unimaginably glorious in its  ultimate consequences, is at present sweeping the face of the earth. Its  driving power is remorselessly gaining in range and momentum. Its  cleansing force, however much undetected, is increasing with every passing  day. Humanity, gripped in the clutches of its devastating power, is  smitten by the evidences of its resistless fury. It can neither perceive  its origin, nor probe its significance, nor discern its outcome.  Bewildered, agonized and helpless, it watches this great and mighty wind  of God invading the remotest and fairest regions of the earth, rocking its  foundations, deranging its equilibrium, sundering its nations, disrupting  the homes of its peoples, wasting its cities, driving into exile its  kings, pulling down its bulwarks, uprooting its institutions, dimming its  light, and harrowing up the souls of its inhabitants.    \"The time for the destruction of the world and its people,\" Baha'u'llah's  prophetic pen has proclaimed, \"hath arrived.\" \"The hour is approaching,\"  He specifically affirms, \"when the most great convulsion will have  appeared.\" \"The promised day is come, the day when tormenting trials will  have surged above your heads, and beneath your feet, saying: 'Taste ye  what your hands have wrought!'\" \"Soon shall the blasts of His chastisement  beat upon you, and the dust of hell enshroud you.\" And again: \"And when  the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall  cause the limbs of mankind to quake.\" \"The day is approaching when its  [civilization's] flame will devour the cities, when the Tongue of Grandeur  will proclaim: 'The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Praised!'\"  \"The day will soon come,\" He, referring to the foolish ones of the earth,  has written, \"whereon they will cry out for help and receive no answer.\"  \"The day is approaching,\" He moreover has prophesied, \"when the wrathful  anger of the Almighty will have taken hold of them. He, verily, is the  Omnipotent, the All-Subduing, the Most Powerful. He shall cleanse the  earth from the defilement of their corruption, and shall give it for an  heritage unto such of His servants as are nigh unto Him.\"    \"As to those who deny Him Who is the Sublime Gate of God,\" the Bab, for  His part, has affirmed in the Qayyum-i-Asma, \"for them We have prepared,  as justly decreed by God, a sore torment. And He, God, is the Mighty, the  Wise.\" And further, \"O peoples of the earth! I swear by your Lord! Ye  shall act as former generations have acted. Warn ye, then, yourselves of  the terrible, the most grievous vengeance of God. For God is, verily,  potent over all things.\" And again: \"By My glory! I will make the infidels  to taste, with the hands of My power, retributions unknown of anyone  except Me, and will waft over the faithful those "]]]
