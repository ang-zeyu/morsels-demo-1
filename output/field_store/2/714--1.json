Page 11.]          PREFACE.      The following stories have been, time out of mind, in their original  form, recited around the lodge-fires and under the trees, by the Indian  story-tellers, for the entertainment of the red children of the West.  They were originally interpreted from the old tales and legends by the  late Henry R. Schoolcraft, and are now re-interpreted and developed by  the Editor, so as to enable them, as far as worthy, to take a place with  the popular versions of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, Cinderella,  Little Red Riding Hood, and other world-renowned tales of Europe and the  East, to which, in their original conception, they bear a resemblance in  romantic interest and quaint extravagance of fancy. The Editor hopes  that these beautiful and sprightly legends of the West, if not marred in  the handling, will repay, in part at least, the glorious debt which we  have incurred to the Eastern World for her magical gifts of the same  kind.

THE CELESTIAL SISTERS.      Waupee, or the White Hawk, lived in a remote part of the forest, where  animals abounded. Every day he returned from the chase with a large  spoil, for he was one of the most skillful and lucky hunters of his  tribe. His form was like the cedar; the fire of youth beamed from his  eye; there was no forest too gloomy for him to penetrate, and no track  made by bird or beast of any kind which he could not readily follow.    One day he had gone beyond any point which he had ever before visited.  He traveled through an open wood, which enabled him to see a great  distance. At length he beheld a light breaking through the foliage of  the distant trees, which made him sure that he was on the borders of a  prairie. It was a wide plain, covered with long blue grass, and enameled  with flowers of a thousand lovely tints.    After walking for some time without a path, musing upon the open  country, and enjoying the fragrant breeze, he suddenly came to a ring  worn among the grass and the flowers, as if it had been made by  footsteps moving lightly round and round. But it was strange--so strange  as to cause the White Hawk to pause and gaze long and fixedly upon the  ground--there was no path which led to this flowery circle. There was  not even a crushed leaf nor a broken twig, nor the least trace of a  footstep, approaching or retiring, to be found. He thought he would hide  himself and lie in wait to discover, if he could, what this strange  circle meant.    Presently he heard the faint sounds of music in the air. He looked up in  the direction they came from, and as the magic notes died away he saw a  small object, like a little summer cloud that approaches the earth,  floating down from above. At first it was very small, and seemed as if  it could have been blown away by the first breeze that came along; but  it rapidly grew as he gazed upon it, and the music every moment came  clearer and more sweetly to his ear. As it neared the earth it appeared  as a basket, and it was filled with twelve sisters, of the most lovely  forms and enchanting beauty.    As soon as the basket touched the ground they leaped out, and began  straightway to dance, in the most joyous manner, around the magic ring,  striking, as they did so, a shining ball, which uttered the most  ravishing melodies, and kept time as they danced.    The White Hawk, from his concealment, entranced, gazed upon their  graceful forms and movements. He admired them all, but he was most  pleased with the youngest. He longed to be at her side, to embrace her,  to call her his own; and unable to remain longer a silent admirer, he  rushed out and endeavored to seize this twelfth beauty who so enchanted  him. But the sisters, with the quickness of birds, the moment they  descried the form of a man, leaped back into the basket, and were drawn  up into the sky.    Lamenting his ill-luck, Waupee gazed longingly upon the fairy basket as  it ascended and bore the lovely sisters from his view. \"They are gone,\"  he said, \"and I shall see them no more.\"    He returned to his solitary lodge, but he found no relief to his mind.  He walked abroad, but to look at the sky, which had withdrawn from his  sight the only being he had ever loved, was painful to him now.    The next day, selecting the same hour, the White Hawk went back to the  prairie, and took his station near the ring; in order to deceive the  sisters, he assumed the form of an opossum, and sat among the grass as  if he were there engaged in chewing the cud. He had not waited long when  he saw the cloudy basket descend, and heard the same sweet music  falling as before. He crept slowly toward the ring; but the instant the  sisters caught sight of him they were startled, and sprang into their  car. It rose a short distance when one of the elder sisters spoke:    \"Perhaps,\" she said, \"it is come to show us how the game is played by  mortals.\"    \"Oh no,\" the youngest replied; \"quick, let us ascend.\"    And all joining in a chant, they rose out of sight.    Waupee, casting off his disguise, walked sorrowfully back to his  lodge--but ah, the night seemed very long to lonely White Hawk! His  whole soul was filled with the thought of the beautiful sister.    Betimes, the next day, he returned to the haunted spot, hoping and  fearing, and sighing as though his very soul would leave his body in its  anguish. He reflected upon the plan he should follow to secure success.  He had already failed twice; to fail a third time would be fatal. Near  by he found an old stump, much covered with moss, and just then in use  as the residence of a number of mice, who had stopped there on a  pilgrimage to some relatives on the other side of the prairie. The White  Hawk was so pleased with their tidy little forms that he thought he,  too, would be a mouse, especially as they were by no means formidable  to look at, and would not be at all likely to create alarm.    He accordingly, having first brought the stump and set it near the ring,  without further notice became a mouse, and peeped and sported about, and  kept his sharp little eyes busy with the others; but he did not forget  to keep one eye up toward the sky, and one ear wide open in the same  direction.    It was not long before the sisters, at their customary hour, came down  and resumed their sport.    \"But see,\" cried the younger sister, \"that stump was not there before.\"    She ran off, frightened, toward the basket. Her sisters only smiled, and  gathering round the old tree-stump, they struck it, in jest, when out  ran the mice, and among them Waupee. They killed them all but one, which  was pursued by the younger sister. Just as she had raised a silver stick  which she held in her hand to put an end to it, too, the form of the  White Hawk arose, and he clasped his prize in his arms. The other eleven  sprang to their basket, and were drawn up to the skies.    Waupee exerted all his skill to please his bride and win her affections.  He wiped the tears from her eyes; he related his adventures in the  chase; he dwelt upon the charms of life on the earth. He was constant in  his attentions, keeping fondly by her side, and picking out the way for  her to walk as he led her gently toward his lodge.

He's  too fresh.\"    A white-haired German reached for a sandwich, and grunted between  bites: \"I know der breed. Ameriga is full of dot kind. I dell you you  should imbort ropes' ends free under your dariff.\"    \"Pshaw! There isn't any real harm to him. He's more to be pitied than  anything,\" a man from New York drawled, as he lay at full length along  the cushions under the wet skylight. \"They've dragged him around from  hotel to hotel ever since he was a kid. I was talking to his mother  this morning. She's a lovely lady, but she don't pretend to manage him.  He's going to Europe to finish his education.\"    \"Education isn't begun yet.\" This was a Philadelphian, curled up in a  corner. \"That boy gets two hundred a month pocket-money, he told me. He  isn't sixteen either.\"    \"Railroads, his father, aind't it?\" said the German.    \"Yep. That and mines and lumber and shipping. Built one place at San  Diego, the old man has; another at Los Angeles; owns half a dozen  railroads, half the lumber on the Pacific slope, and lets his wife  spend the money,\" the Philadelphian went on lazily. \"The West don't  suit her, she says. She just tracks around with the boy and her nerves,  trying to find out what'll amuse him, I guess. Florida, Adirondacks,  Lakewood, Hot Springs, New York, and round again. He isn't much more  than a second-hand hotel clerk now. When he's finished in Europe he'll  be a holy terror.\"    \"What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?\" said  a voice from the frieze ulster.    \"Old man's piling up the rocks. 'Don't want to be disturbed, I guess.  He'll find out his error a few years from now. 'Pity, because there's a  heap of good in the boy if you could get at it.\"    \"Mit a rope's end; mit a rope's end!\" growled the German.    Once more the door banged, and a slight, slim-built boy perhaps fifteen  years old, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his  mouth, leaned in over the high footway. His pasty yellow complexion did  not show well on a person of his years, and his look was a mixture of  irresolution, bravado, and very cheap smartness. He was dressed in a  cherry-coloured blazer, knickerbockers, red stockings, and bicycle  shoes, with a red flannel cap at the back of the head. After whistling  between his teeth, as he eyed the company, he said in a loud, high  voice: \"Say, it's thick outside. You can hear the fish-boats squawking  all around us. Say, wouldn't it be great if we ran down one?\"    \"Shut the door, Harvey,\" said the New Yorker. \"Shut the door and stay  outside. You're not wanted here.\"    \"Who'll stop me?\" he answered deliberately. \"Did you pay for my  passage, Mister Martin? 'Guess I've as good right here as the next man.\"    He picked up some dice from a checker-board and began throwing, right  hand against left.    \"Say, gen'elmen, this is deader'n mud. Can't we make a game of poker  between us?\"    There was no answer, and he puffed his cigarette, swung his legs, and  drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers. Then he pulled out a  roll of bills as if to count them.    \"How's your mamma this afternoon?\" a man said. \"I didn't see her at  lunch.\"    \"In her state-room, I guess. She's 'most always sick on the ocean. I'm  going to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her. I  don't go down more 'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass  that butler's-pantry place. Say, this is the first time I've been on  the ocean.\"    \"Oh, don't apologise, Harvey.\"    \"Who's apologising? This is the first time I've crossed the ocean,  gen'elmen, and, except the first day, I haven't been sick one little  bit. No, sir!\" He brought down his fist with a triumphant bang, wetted  his finger, and went on counting the bills.    \"Oh, you're a high-grade machine, with the writing in plain sight,\" the  Philadelphian yawned. \"You'll blossom into a credit to your country if  you don't take care.\"    \"I know it. I'm an American--first, last, and all the time. I'll show  'em that when I strike Europe. Pif! My cig's out. I can't smoke the  truck the steward sells. Any gen'elman got a real Turkish cig on him?\"    The chief engineer entered for a moment, red, smiling, and wet. \"Say,  Mac,\" cried Harvey, cheerfully, \"how are we hitting it?\"    \"Vara much in the ordinary way,\" was the grave reply. \"The young are as  polite as ever to their elders, an' their elders are e'en tryin' to  appreciate it.\"    A low chuckle came from a corner. The German opened his cigar-case and  handed a skinny black cigar to Harvey.    \"Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke, my young friendt,\" he said. \"You  vill dry it? Yes? Den you vill be efer so happy.\"    Harvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish: he felt that he was  getting on in grown-up society.    \"It would take more 'n this to keel me over,\" he said, ignorant that he  was lighting that terrible article, a Wheeling 'stogie'.    \"Dot we shall bresently see,\" said the German. \"Where are we now, Mr.  Mactonal'?\"     \"Just there or thereabouts, Mr. Schaefer,\" said the engineer.  \"We'll be on the Grand Bank to-night; but in a general way o' speakin',  we're all among the fishing-fleet now. We've shaved three dories an'  near skelped the boom off a Frenchman since noon, an' that's close  sailin', ye may say.\"    \"You like my cigar, eh?\" the German asked, for Harvey's eyes were full  of tears.    \"Fine, full flavour,\" he answered through shut teeth. \"Guess we've  slowed down a little, haven't we? I'll skip out and see what the log  says.\"    \"I might if I vhas you,\" said the German.    Harvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail. He was very  unhappy; but he saw the deck-steward lashing chairs together, and,  since he had boasted before the man that he was never seasick, his  pride made him go aft to the second-saloon deck at the stern, which was  finished in a turtle-back. The deck was deserted, and he crawled to the  extreme end of it, near the flagpole. There he doubled up in limp  agony, for the Wheeling \"stogie\" joined with the surge and jar of the  screw to sieve out his soul. His head swelled; sparks of fire danced  before his eyes; his body seemed to lose weight, while his heels  wavered in the breeze. He was fainting from seasickness, and a roll of  the ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the  turtle-back. Then a low, grey mother-wave swung out of the fog, tucked  Harvey under one arm, so to speak, and pulled him off and away to  leeward; the great green closed over him, and he went quietly to sleep.    He was roused by the sound of a dinner-horn such as they used to blow  at a summer-school he had once attended in the Adirondacks. Slowly he  remembered that he was Harvey Cheyne, drowned and dead in mid-ocean,  but was too weak to fit things together. A new smell filled his  nostrils; wet and clammy chills ran down his back, and he was  helplessly full of salt water. When he opened his eyes, he perceived  that he was still on the top of the sea, for it was running round him  in silver-coloured hills, and he was lying on a pile of half-dead fish,  looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey.    \"It's no good,\" thought the boy. \"I'm dead, sure enough, and this thing  is in charge.\"    He groaned, and the figure turned its head, showing a pair of little  gold rings half hidden in curly black hair.    \"Aha! You feel some pretty well now'?\" it said. \"Lie still so: we trim  better.\"    With a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boat-head on to a foamless  sea that lifted her twenty full feet, only to slide her into a glassy  pit beyond. But this mountain-climbing did not interrupt blue-jersey's  talk. \"Fine good job, I say, that I catch you. Eh, wha-at? Better good  job, I say, your boat not catch me. How you come to fall out?\"    \"I was sick,\" said Harvey; \"sick, and couldn't help it.\"    \"Just in time I blow my horn, and your boat she yaw a little. Then I  see you come all down. Eh, wha-at? I think you are cut into baits by  the screw, but you dreeft--dreeft to me, and I make a big fish of you.  So you shall not die this time.\"    \"Where am I?\" said Harvey, who could not see that life was particularly  safe where he lay.    \"You are with me in the dory--Manuel my name, and I come from schooner  'We're Here' of Gloucester. I live to Gloucester. By-and-by we get  supper. Eh, wha-at?\"    He seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not  content with blowing through a big conch-shell, he must needs stand up  to it, swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory, and send a  grinding, thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this  entertainment lasted, Harvey could not remember, for he lay back  terrified at the sight of the smoking swells. He fancied he heard a gun  and a horn and shouting. Something bigger than the dory, but quite as  lively, loomed alongside. Several voices talked at once; he was dropped  into a dark, heaving hole, where men in oilskins gave him a hot drink  and took off his clothes, and he fell asleep.    When he waked he listened for the first breakfast-bell on the steamer,  wondering why his stateroom had grown so small. Turning, he looked into  a narrow, triangular cave, lit by a lamp hung against a huge square  beam. A three-cornered table within arm's reach ran from the angle of  the bows to the foremast. At the after end, behind a well-used Plymouth  stove, sat a boy about his own age, with a flat red face and a pair of  twinkling grey eyes. He was dressed in a blue jersey and high rubber  boots.
