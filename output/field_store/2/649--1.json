CONCLUSION                          238          A SHORT HISTORY OF ENGLAND          I    INTRODUCTION      It will be very reasonably asked why I should consent, though upon a  sort of challenge, to write even a popular essay in English history, who  make no pretence to particular scholarship and am merely a member of the  public. The answer is that I know just enough to know one thing: that a  history from the standpoint of a member of the public has not been  written. What we call the popular histories should rather be called the  anti-popular histories. They are all, nearly without exception, written  against the people; and in them the populace is either ignored or  elaborately proved to have been wrong. It is true that Green called his  book \"A Short History of the English People\"; but he seems to have  thought it too short for the people to be properly mentioned. For  instance, he calls one very large part of his story \"Puritan England.\"  But England never was Puritan. It would have been almost as unfair to  call the rise of Henry of Navarre \"Puritan France.\" And some of our  extreme Whig historians would have been pretty nearly capable of calling  the campaign of Wexford and Drogheda \"Puritan Ireland.\"    But it is especially in the matter of the Middle Ages that the popular  histories trample upon the popular traditions. In this respect there is  an almost comic contrast between the general information provided about  England in the last two or three centuries, in which its present  industrial system was being built up, and the general information given  about the preceding centuries, which we call broadly mediaeval. Of the  sort of waxwork history which is thought sufficient for the side-show of  the age of abbots and crusaders, a small instance will be sufficient. A  popular Encyclopaedia appeared some years ago, professing among other  things to teach English History to the masses; and in this I came upon a  series of pictures of the English kings. No one could expect them to be  all authentic; but the interest attached to those that were necessarily  imaginary. There is much vivid material in contemporary literature for  portraits of men like Henry II. or Edward I.; but this did not seem to  have been found, or even sought. And wandering to the image that stood  for Stephen of Blois, my eye was staggered by a gentleman with one of  those helmets with steel brims curved like a crescent, which went with  the age of ruffs and trunk-hose. I am tempted to suspect that the head  was that of a halberdier at some such scene as the execution of Mary  Queen of Scots. But he had a helmet; and helmets were mediaeval; and any  old helmet was good enough for Stephen.    Now suppose the readers of that work of reference had looked for the  portrait of Charles I. and found the head of a policeman. Suppose it had  been taken, modern helmet and all, out of some snapshot in the _Daily  Sketch_ of the arrest of Mrs. Pankhurst. I think we may go so far as to  say that the readers would have refused to accept it as a lifelike  portrait of Charles I. They would have formed the opinion that there  must be some mistake. Yet the time that elapsed between Stephen and Mary  was much longer than the time that has elapsed between Charles and  ourselves. The revolution in human society between the first of the  Crusades and the last of the Tudors was immeasurably more colossal and  complete than any change between Charles and ourselves. And, above all,  that revolution should be the first thing and the final thing in  anything calling itself a popular history. For it is the story of how  our populace gained great things, but to-day has lost everything.    Now I will modestly maintain that I know more about English history than  this; and that I have as much right to make a popular summary of it as  the gentleman who made the crusader and the halberdier change hats. But  the curious and arresting thing about the neglect, one might say the  omission, of mediaeval civilization in such histories as this, lies in  the fact I have already noted. It is exactly the popular story that is  left out of the popular history. For instance, even a working man, a  carpenter or cooper or bricklayer, has been taught about the Great  Charter, as something like the Great Auk, save that its almost monstrous  solitude came from being before its time instead of after. He was not  taught that the whole stuff of the Middle Ages was stiff with the  parchment of charters; that society was once a system of charters, and  of a kind much more interesting to him. The carpenter heard of one  charter given to barons, and chiefly in the interest of barons; the  carpenter did not hear of any of the charters given to carpenters, to  coopers, to all the people like himself. Or, to take another instance,  the boy and girl reading the stock simplified histories of the schools  practically never heard of such a thing as a burgher, until he appears  in a shirt with a noose round his neck. They certainly do not imagine  anything of what he meant in the Middle Ages. And Victorian shopkeepers  did not conceive themselves as taking part in any such romance as the  adventure of Courtrai, where the mediaeval shopkeepers more than won  their spurs--for they won the spurs of their enemies.    I have a very simple motive and excuse for telling the little I know of  this true tale. I have met in my wanderings a man brought up in the  lower quarters of a great house, fed mainly on its leavings and burdened  mostly with its labours. I know that his complaints are stilled, and  his status justified, by a story that is told to him. It is about how  his grandfather was a chimpanzee and his father a wild man of the woods,  caught by hunters and tamed into something like intelligence. In the  light of this, he may well be thankful for the almost human life that he  enjoys; and may be content with the hope of leaving behind him a yet  more evolved animal. Strangely enough, the calling of this story by the  sacred name of Progress ceased to satisfy me when I began to suspect  (and to discover) that it is not true. I know by now enough at least of  his origin to know that he was not evolved, but simply disinherited. His  family tree is not a monkey tree, save in the sense that no monkey could  have climbed it; rather it is like that tree torn up by the roots and  named \"Dedischado,\" on the shield of the unknown knight.          II    THE PROVINCE OF BRITAIN      The land on which we live once had the highly poetic privilege of being  the end of the world. Its extremity was _ultima Thule_, the other end of  nowhere. When these islands, lost in a night of northern seas, were lit  up at last by the long searchlights of Rome, it was felt that the  remotest remnant of things had been touched; and more for pride than  possession.    The sentiment was not unsuitable, even in geography. About these realms  upon the edge of everything there was really something that can only be  called edgy. Britain is not so much an island as an archipelago; it is  at least a labyrinth of peninsulas. In few of the kindred countries can  one so easily and so strangely find sea in the fields or fields in the  sea. The great rivers seem not only to meet in the ocean, but barely to  miss each other in the hills: the whole land, though low as a whole,  leans towards the west in shouldering mountains; and a prehistoric  tradition has taught it to look towards the sunset for islands yet  dreamier than its own. The islanders are of a kind with their islands.  Different as are the nations into which they are now divided, the  Scots, the English, the Irish, the Welsh of the western uplands, have  something altogether different from the humdrum docility of the inland  Germans, or from the _bon sens francais_ which can be at will trenchant  or trite. There is something common to all the Britons, which even Acts  of Union have not torn asunder. The nearest name for it is insecurity,  something fitting in men walking on cliffs and the verge of things.  Adventure, a lonely taste in liberty, a humour without wit, perplex  their critics and perplex themselves. Their souls are fretted like their  coasts. They have an embarrassment, noted by all foreigners: it is  expressed, perhaps, in the Irish by a confusion of speech and in the  English by a confusion of thought. For the Irish bull is a license with  the symbol of language. But Bull's own bull, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#1)"],[1,"TURN OF THE SCREW    by Henry James      [The text is take from the first American appearance of this book.]            THE TURN OF THE SCREW      The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but  except the obvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve  in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no  comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case  he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case, I  may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had  gathered us for the occasion--an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a  little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the  terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to  sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded  in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation  that drew from Douglas--not immediately, but later in the evening--a  reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention.  Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was  not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself something to  produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in fact till two  nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out  what was in his mind.    \"I quite agree--in regard to Griffin's ghost, or whatever it was--that  its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a  particular touch. But it's not the first occurrence of its charming  kind that I know to have involved a child. If the child gives the effect  another turn of the screw, what do you say to TWO children--?\"    \"We say, of course,\" somebody exclaimed, \"that they give two turns! Also  that we want to hear about them.\"    I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to  present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in  his pockets. \"Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It's quite too  horrible.\" This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the  thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his  triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: \"It's  beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches it.\"    \"For sheer terror?\" I remember asking.    He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss  how to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little  wincing grimace. \"For dreadful--dreadfulness!\"    \"Oh, how delicious!\" cried one of the women.    He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me,  he saw what he spoke of. \"For general uncanny ugliness and horror and  pain.\"    \"Well then,\" I said, \"just sit right down and begin.\"    He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an  instant. Then as he faced us again: \"I can't begin. I shall have to send  to town.\" There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after  which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. \"The story's written. It's  in a locked drawer--it has not been out for years. I could write to my  man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it.\"  It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this--appeared  almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a thickness  of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long  silence. The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples  that charmed me. I adjured him to write by the first post and to agree  with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in  question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt. \"Oh, thank  God, no!\"    \"And is the record yours? You took the thing down?\"    \"Nothing but the impression. I took that HERE\"--he tapped his heart.  \"I've never lost it.\"    \"Then your manuscript--?\"    \"Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.\" He hung fire  again. \"A woman's. She has been dead these twenty years. She sent me the  pages in question before she died.\" They were all listening now, and  of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the  inference. But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also  without irritation. \"She was a most charming person, but she was ten  years older than I. She was my sister's governess,\" he quietly said.  \"She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position;  she would have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this  episode was long before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at home on  my coming down the second summer. I was much there that year--it was a  beautiful one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in  the garden--talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh  yes; don't grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think  she liked me, too. If she hadn't she wouldn't have told me. She had  never told anyone. It wasn't simply that she said so, but that I knew  she hadn't. I was sure; I could see. You'll easily judge why when you  hear.\"    \"Because the thing had been such a scare?\"    He continued to fix me. \"You'll easily judge,\" he repeated: \"YOU will.\"    I fixed him, too. \"I see. She was in love.\"    He laughed for the first time. \"You ARE acute. Yes, she was in love.  That is, she had been. That came out--she couldn't tell her story  without its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither of  us spoke of it. I remember the time and the place--the corner of the  lawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summer afternoon.  It wasn't a scene for a shudder; but oh--!\" He quitted the fire and  dropped back into his chair.    \"You'll receive the packet Thursday morning?\" I inquired.    \"Probably not till the second post.\"    \"Well then; after dinner--\"    \"You'll all meet me here?\" He looked us round again. \"Isn't anybody  going?\" It was almost the tone of hope.    \"Everybody will stay!\"    \"_I_ will\"--and \"_I_ will!\" cried the ladies whose departure had been  fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more  light. \"Who was it she was in love with?\"    \"The story will tell,\" I took upon myself to reply.    \"Oh, I can't wait for the story!\"    \"The story WON'T tell,\" said Douglas; \"not in any literal, vulgar way.\"    \"More's the pity, then. That's the only way I ever understand.\"    \"Won't YOU tell, Douglas?\" somebody else inquired.    He sprang to his feet again. \"Yes--tomorrow. Now I must go to bed.  Good night.\" And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly  bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on  the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. \"Well, if I don't know who she  was in love with, I know who HE was.\"    \"She was ten years older,\" said her husband.    \"Raison de plus--at that age! But it's rather nice, his long reticence.\"    \"Forty years!\" Griffin put in.    \"With this outbreak at last.\"    \"The outbreak,\" I returned, \"will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday  night;\" and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost  all attention for everything else. The last story, however incomplete  and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and  \"candlestuck,\" as somebody said, and went to bed.    I knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first  post, gone off to his London apartments; but in spite of--or perhaps  just on account of--the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite  let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in  fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes  were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and  indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again  before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the  previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read  us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue.  Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative,  from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall  presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death--when it was in  sight--committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of  these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began  to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The  departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't, of course, thank  heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a  rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with  which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final  auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to  a common thrill.    The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up  the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in  possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several  daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking  service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to London, in  trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had already  placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This person  proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley  Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing--this prospective patron  proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as  had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered,  anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type;  it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant,  offhand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and  splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she  afterward showed was that he put the whole "]]]
