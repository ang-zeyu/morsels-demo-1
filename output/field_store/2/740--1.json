When we survey the really illimitable field of human knowledge, the vast  accumulation of works already printed, and the ever-increasing flood of  new books poured out by the modern press, the first feeling which is apt  to arise in the mind is one of dismay, if not of despair. We ask--who is  sufficient for these things? What life is long enough--what intellect  strong enough, to master even a tithe of the learning which all these  books contain? But the reflection comes to our aid that, after all, the  really important books bear but a small proportion to the mass. Most  books are but repetitions, in a different form, of what has already been  many times written and printed. The rarest of literary qualities is  originality. Most writers are mere echoes, and the greater part of  literature is the pouring out of one bottle into another. If you can get  hold of the few really best books, you can well afford to be ignorant of  all the rest. The reader who has mastered Kames's \"Elements of  Criticism,\" need not spend his time over the multitudinous treatises upon  rhetoric. He who has read Plutarch's Lives thoroughly has before him a  gallery of heroes which will go farther to instruct him in the elements  of character than a whole library of modern biographies. The student of  the best plays of Shakespeare may save his time by letting other and  inferior dramatists alone. He whose imagination has been fed upon Homer,  Dante, Milton, Burns, and Tennyson, with a few of the world's  master-pieces in single poems like Gray's Elegy, may dispense with the  whole race of poetasters. Until you have read the best fictions of  Scott, Thackeray, Dickens, Hawthorne, George Eliot, and Victor Hugo, you  should not be hungry after the last new novel,--sure to be forgotten in a  year, while the former are perennial. The taste which is once formed upon  models such as have been named, will not be satisfied with the trashy  book, or the spasmodic school of writing.    What kind of books should form the predominant part in the selection of  our reading, is a question admitting of widely differing opinions. Rigid  utilitarians may hold that only books of fact, of history and science,  works crammed full of knowledge, should be encouraged. Others will plead  in behalf of lighter reading, or for a universal range. It must be  admitted that the most attractive reading to the mass of people is not  scientific or philosophical. But there are many very attractive books  outside the field of science, and outside the realm of fiction, books  capable of yielding pleasure as well as instruction. There are few books  that render a more substantial benefit to readers of any age than good  biographies. In them we find those personal experiences and adventures,  those traits of character, that environment of social and domestic life,  which form the chief interest in works of fiction. In fact, the novel, in  its best estate, is only biography amplified by imagination, and  enlivened by dialogue. And the novel is successful only when it succeeds  in depicting the most truly the scenes, circumstances, and characters of  real life. A well written biography, like that of Dr. Johnson, by  Boswell, Walter Scott, by Lockhart, or Charles Dickens, by Forster, gives  the reader an insight into the history of the times they lived in, the  social, political, and literary environment, and the impress of their  famous writings upon their contemporaries. In the autobiography of Dr.  Franklin, one of the most charming narratives ever written, we are taken  into the writer's confidence, sympathize with his early struggles,  mistakes, and successes, and learn how he made himself, from a poor boy  selling ballads on Boston streets, into a leader among men, whom two  worlds have delighted to honor. Another most interesting book of  biography is that of the brothers William and Robert Chambers, the famous  publishers of Edinburgh, who did more to diffuse useful knowledge, and to  educate the people, by their manifold cheap issues of improving and  entertaining literature, than was ever done by the British Useful  Knowledge Society itself.    The French nation has, of all others, the greatest genius for personal  memoirs, and the past two centuries are brought far more vividly before  us in these free-spoken and often amusing chronicles, than in all the  formal histories. Among the most readable of these (comparatively few  having been translated into English) are the Memoirs of Marmontel,  Rousseau, Madame Remusat, Amiel, and Madame De Stael. The recently  published memoirs by Imbert de St. Amand, of court life in France in the  times of Marie Antoinette, Josephine, Marie Louise, and other periods,  while hastily written and not always accurate, are lively and  entertaining.    The English people fall far behind the French in biographic skill, and  many of their memoirs are as heavy and dull as the persons whom they  commemorate. But there are bright exceptions, in the lives of literary  men and women, and in some of those of noted public men in church and  state. Thus, there are few books more enjoyable than Sydney Smith's  Memoirs and Letters, or Greville's Journals covering the period including  George IV to Victoria, or the Life and Letters of Macaulay, or Mrs.  Gaskell's Charlotte Bronte, or the memoirs of Harriet Martineau, or  Boswell's Life of Dr. Johnson. Among the briefer biographies worthy of  special mention are the series of English Men of Letters, edited by John  Morley, and written by some of the best of contemporary British writers.  They embrace memoirs of Chaucer, Spenser, Bacon, Sidney, Milton, De Foe,  Swift, Sterne, Fielding, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Johnson, Gray, Addison,  Goldsmith, Burke, Hume, Gibbon, Bunyan, Bentley, Sheridan, Burns, Cowper,  Southey, Scott, Byron, Lamb, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, De  Quincey, Macaulay, Landor, Dickens, Thackeray, Hawthorne, and Carlyle.  These biographies, being quite compendious, and in the main very well  written, afford to busy readers a short-hand method of acquainting  themselves with most of the notable writers of Britain, their personal  characteristics, their relation to their contemporaries, and the quality  and influence of their works. Americans have not as yet illustrated the  field of biographic literature by many notably skilful examples. We are  especially deficient in good autobiographies, so that Dr. Franklin's  stands almost alone in singular merit in that class. We have an abundance  of lives of notable generals, professional men, and politicians, in which  indiscriminate eulogy and partisanship too often usurp the place of  actual facts, and the truth of history is distorted to glorify the merits  of the subject of the biography. The great success of General Grant's own  Memoirs, too, has led publishers to tempt many public men in military or  civil life, into the field of personal memoirs, not as yet with  distinguished success.    It were to be wished that more writers possessed of some literary skill,  who have borne a part in the wonderful drama involving men and events  enacted in this country during the century now drawing to a close, had  given us their sincere personal impressions in autobiographic form. Such  narratives, in proportion as they are truthful, are far more trustworthy  than history written long after the event by authors who were neither  observers nor participants in the scenes which they describe.    Among American biographies which will help the reader to gain a tolerably  wide acquaintance with the men and affairs of the past century in this  country, are the series of Lives of American Statesmen, of which thirty  volumes have been published. These include Washington, the Adamses,  Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton, Jay,"]]]
