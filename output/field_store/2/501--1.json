Investigations in this department are of great interest, and have  attracted to the field a host of workers; but a general review of the  mass of published matter exhibits the fact that the uses to which the  material has been put have not always been wise.    In the monuments of antiquity found throughout North America, in camp  and village sites, graves, mounds, ruins, and scattered works of art,  the origin and development of art in savage and barbaric life may be  satisfactorily studied. Incidentally, too, hints of customs may be  discovered, but outside of this, the discoveries made have often been  illegitimately used, especially for the purpose of connecting the tribes  of North America with peoples or so-called races of antiquity in other  portions of the world. A brief review of some conclusions that must be  accepted in the present status of the science will exhibit the futility  of these attempts.    It is now an established fact that man was widely scattered over the  earth at least as early as the beginning of the quaternary period, and,  perhaps, in pliocene time.    If we accept the conclusion that there is but one species of man, as  species are now defined by biologists, we may reasonably conclude that  the species has been dispersed from some common center, as the ability  to successfully carry on the battle of life in all climes belongs only  to a highly developed being; but this original home has not yet been  ascertained with certainty, and when discovered, lines of migration  therefrom cannot be mapped until the changes in the physical geography  of the earth from that early time to the present have been discovered,  and these must be settled upon purely geologic and paleontologic  evidence. The migrations of mankind from that original home cannot be  intelligently discussed until that home has been discovered, and,  further, until the geology of the globe is so thoroughly known that the  different phases of its geography can be presented.    The dispersion of man must have been anterior to the development of any  but the rudest arts. Since that time the surface of the earth has  undergone many and important changes. All known camp and village sites,  graves, mounds, and ruins belong to that portion of geologic time known  as the present epoch, and are entirely subsequent to the period of the  original dispersion as shown by geologic evidence.    In the study of these antiquities, there has been much unnecessary  speculation in respect to the relation existing between the people to  whose existence they attest, and the tribes of Indians inhabiting the  country during the historic period.    It may be said that in the Pueblos discovered in the southwestern  portion of the United States and farther south through Mexico and  perhaps into Central America tribes are known having a culture quite as  far advanced as any exhibited in the discovered ruins. In this respect,  then, there is no need to search for an extra-limital origin through  lost tribes for any art there exhibited.    With regard to the mounds so widely scattered between the two oceans, it  may also be said that mound-building tribes were known in the early  history of discovery of this continent, and that the vestiges of art  discovered do not excel in any respect the arts of the Indian tribes  known to history. There is, therefore, no reason for us to search for an  extra-limital origin through lost tribes for the arts discovered in the  mounds of North America.    The tracing of the origin of these arts to the ancestors of known tribes  or stocks of tribes is more legitimate, but it has limitations which are  widely disregarded. The tribes which had attained to the highest culture  in the southern portion of North America are now well known to belong to  several different stocks, and, if, for example, an attempt is made to  connect the mound-builders with the Pueblo Indians, no result beyond  confusion can be reached until the particular stock of these village  peoples is designated.    Again, it is contained in the recorded history of the country that  several distinct stocks of the present Indians were mound-builders and  the wide extent and vast number of mounds discovered in the United  States should lead us to suspect, at least, that the mound-builders of  pre-historic times belonged to many and diverse stocks. With the  limitations thus indicated the identification of mound-building peoples  as distinct tribes or stocks is a legitimate study, but when we consider  the further fact now established, that arts extend beyond the boundaries  of linguistic stocks, the most fundamental divisions we are yet able to  make of the peoples of the globe, we may more properly conclude that  this field promises but a meager harvest; but the origin and development  of arts and industries is in itself a vast and profoundly interesting  theme of study, and when North American archaeology is pursued with this  end in view, the results will be instructive.      PICTURE-WRITING.    The pictographs of North America were made on divers substances. The  bark of trees, tablets of wood, the skins of animals, and the surfaces  of rocks were all used for this purpose; but the great body of  picture-writing as preserved to us is found on rock surfaces, as these  are the most enduring.    From Dighton Rock to the cliffs that overhang the Pacific, these records  are found--on bowlders fashioned by the waves of the sea, scattered by  river floods, or polished by glacial ice; on stones buried in graves and  mounds; on faces of rock that appear in ledges by the streams; on canon  walls and towering cliffs; on mountain crags and the ceilings of  caves--wherever smooth surfaces of rock are to be found in North  America, there we may expect to find pictographs. So widely distributed  and so vast in number, it is well to know what purposes they may serve  in anthropologic science.    Many of these pictographs are simply pictures, rude etchings, or  paintings, delineating natural objects, especially animals, and  illustrate simply the beginning of pictorial art; others we know were  intended to commemorate events or to represent other ideas entertained  by their authors; but to a large extent these were simply mnemonic--not  conveying ideas of themselves, but designed more thoroughly to retain in  memory certain events or thoughts by persons who were already cognizant  of the same through current hearsay or tradition. If once the memory of  the thought to be preserved has passed from the minds of men, the record  is powerless to restore its own subject-matter to the understanding.    The great body of picture-writings is thus described; yet to some slight  extent pictographs are found with characters more or less conventional,  and the number of such is quite large in Mexico and Central America. Yet  even these conventional characters are used with others less  conventional in such a manner that perfect records were never made.    Hence it will be seen that it is illegitimate to use any pictographic  matter of a date anterior to the discovery of the continent by Columbus  for historic purposes; but it has a legitimate use of profound interest,  as these pictographs exhibit the beginning of written language and the  beginning of pictorial art, yet undifferentiated; and if the scholars of  America will collect and study the vast body of this material scattered  everywhere--over the valleys and on the mountain sides--from it can be  written one of the most interesting chapters in the early history of  mankind.      HISTORY, CUSTOMS, AND ETHNIC CHARACTERISTICS.    When America was discovered by Europeans, it was inhabited by great  numbers of distinct tribes, diverse in languages, institutions, and  customs. This fact has never been fully recognized, and writers have too  often spoken of the North American Indians as a body, supposing that  statements made of one tribe would apply to all. This fundamental error  in the treatment of the subject has led to great confusion.    Again, the rapid progress in the settlement and occupation of the  country has resulted in the gradual displacement of the Indian tribes,  so that very many have been removed from their ancient homes, some of  whom have been incorporated into other tribes, and some have been  absorbed into the body of civilized people.    The names by which tribes have been designated have rarely been names  used by themselves, and the same tribe has often been designated by  different names in different periods of its history and by different  names in the same period of its history by colonies of people having  different geographic relations to them. Often, too, different tribes  have been designated by the same name. Without entering into an  explanation of the causes which have led to this condition of things, it  is simply necessary to assert that this has led to great confusion of  nomenclature. Therefore the student of Indian history must be constantly  on his guard in accepting the statements of any author relating to any  tribe of Indians.    It will be seen that to follow any tribe of Indians through  post-Columbian times is a task of no little difficulty. Yet this portion  of history is of importance, and the scholars of America have a great  work before them.

(_Photo from Brown Bros._)]          The New Russia Speaks    An Appeal by Russian Authors, Artists, and Actors    [From the Russkia Vedomosti, No. 223, Sept. 28, (Oct. 11,) 1914, P. 6.]      We appeal to our country, we appeal to the whole civilized world.    What our heart and our reason refused to believe has come indisputably  true, to the greatest shame of humanity. Every new day brings new  horrible proofs of the cruelty and the vandalism of the Germans in the  bloody clash of nations which we are witnessing, in that neutral  slaughtering of brothers provoked by the madness of these same Germans;  in their vainglorious ambition to rule the world with violence, they are  throwing upon the scales of the world's justice nothing but the sword.  We fancy that Germany, oblivious of her past fame, has turned to the  altars of her cruel national gods whose defeat has been accomplished by  the incarnation of the one gracious god upon earth. Her warriors seem to  have assumed the miserable duty of reminding humanity of the latent  vigor of the aboriginal beast within man, of the fact that even the  leading nations of civilization, by letting loose their ill-will, may  easily fall back on an equal footing with their forefathers--those half  naked bands that fifteen centuries ago trampled under their heavy feet  the ancient inheritance of civilization. As in the days of yore, again  priceless productions of art, temples, and libraries perish in  conflagration, whole cities and towns are wiped off the face of the  earth, rivers are overflowing with blood, through heaps of cadavers  savage men are hewing their path, and those whose lips are shouting in  honor of their criminal supreme commander are inflicting untold tortures  and infamies upon defenseless people, upon aged men and women, upon  captives and wounded.    Let these horrible crimes be entered upon the Book of Fate with eternal  letters! These crimes shall awake within us one sole burning wish--to  wrest the arms from the barbarous hands, to deprive Germany forever of  that brutal power upon whose achievement she has concentrated all her  thoughts. Already the seed of national pride and of hatred, widely sown  by her, has awakened a magnificent growth. This hatred may spread like  wildfire among other nations, and then will resound the voice of those  blinded by wrath, the voice of those demanding vengeance, the voice of  those repudiating everything great and beautiful among the creations of  the German genius to the rejoicing and for the benefit of all mankind.    But let us remember the disastrous results of such a course--for the  black crimes thrust by Germany upon herself by drawing the sword, and  the outrages in which she has indulged herself while drunk with victory  are the inevitable fruits of the darkness which she has voluntarily  entered. At present she is pursuing this course, encouraged even by her  poets, scientists, and social and political leaders.    Her adversaries, carrying peace and victory to their peoples, shall  indeed be inspired solely by holy motives.    _Signed by:_    K. ARSENIEV, I. BUNIN, A. VESSELOVSKI, NESTOR KOTLIAREVSKI, and D.

The following address, signed by a number of distinguished       writers in Great Britain, and intended for publication in       Russia, appeared in The London Times on Dec. 23, 1914.    _To Our Colleagues in Russia:_      At this moment, when your countrymen and ours are alike facing death for  the deliverance of Europe, we Englishmen of letters take the opportunity  of uttering to you feelings which have been in our hearts for many  years. You yourselves perhaps hardly realize what an inspiration  Englishmen of the last two generations have found in your literature.    Many a writer among us can still call back, from ten or twenty or thirty  years ago, the feeling of delight and almost of bewilderment with which  he read his first Russian novel. Perhaps it was \"Virgin Soil\" or  \"Fathers and Sons,\" perhaps \"War and Peace,\" or \"Anna Karenina\"; perhaps  \"Crime and Punishment\" or \"The Idiot\"; perhaps, again, it was the work  of some author still living. But many of us then felt, as our poet Keats  felt on first reading Homer,          \"like some watcher of the skies      When a new planet swims into his ken.\"    It was a strange world that opened before us, a world full of foreign  names which we could neither pronounce nor remember, of foreign customs  and articles of daily life which we could not understand. Yet beneath  all the strangeness"]]]
