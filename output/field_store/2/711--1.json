MY DEAR BOYS: With this I present to you \"The Rover Boys on the Farm,\"  the twelfth volume in the \"Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"    It is a large number of volumes to write about one set of characters,  isn't it? When I started the series, many years ago, I had in mind, as I  have told you before, to pen three books, possibly four. But as soon as  I had written \"The Rover Boys at School,\" \"The Rover Boys on the Ocean,\"  and \"The Rover Boys in the Jungle,\" there was a cry for more, and so I  wrote \"The Rover Boys Out West,\" \"On the Great Lakes,\" \"In the  Mountains,\" \"On Land and Sea,\" \"In Camp,\" \"On the River,\" \"On the  Plains,\" and then \"In Southern Waters,\" where we last left our heroes.    In the present story, as promised in the last volume, the scene is  shifted back to the farm and to dear old Putnam Hall, with their many  pleasant associations. As before, Sam, Tom and Dick are to the front,  along with several of their friends, and there are a number of  adventures, some comical and some strange and mystifying. At the school  the rivalries are as keen as ever, but the Rover boys are on their  mettle, and prove their worth on more than one occasion.    Again I thank my numerous readers for all the kind words they have  spoken about my stories. I hope the present volume will please them in  every way.    Affectionately and sincerely yours,    EDWARD STRATEMEYER          CONTENTS.             I. SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS          II. WHAT HAPPENED ON THE MOUNTAIN         III.

GOOD-BYE TO PUTNAM HALL          THE ROVER BOYS ON THE FARM          CHAPTER I    SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS      \"Sam, this isn't the path.\"    \"I know it, Tom.\"    \"We've missed our way,\" went on Tom Rover, with a serious look on his  usually sunny face.    \"It looks that way to me,\" answered Sam Rover, his younger brother. \"I  think we made a wrong turn after we slid down the cliff.\"    \"What is keeping Dick?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Let's call to him,\" went on Tom, and set up a loud cry, in which his  brother joined. The pair listened intently, but no answer came back.    \"I don't like this,\" said Sam, an anxious look in his clear eyes. \"Maybe  Dick is in trouble.\"    \"Perhaps so,\" answered Tom Rover.    The two boys were far up on a mountainside, and all around them were  tall trees, thick brushwood, and immense ridges of rocks. It had been a  clear, sunshiny day, but now the sky was overcast, and it looked like  rain.    \"We've got to go back for Dick,\" said Tom, after a painful pause. \"No  use of going on without him.\"    \"I hope he hasn't fallen over some cliff and hurt himself,\" returned his  younger brother.    \"I don't see why he doesn't answer us, if he's all right,\" was the  unsatisfactory reply. \"Come on, or the storm will overtake us before we  get down from the mountain and we'll be soaked by the time we reach  home.\"    Side by side the brothers retraced their steps--a hard task, for it is  much easier to climb down a steep mountainside than to climb up.    To those who have read the previous volumes in this \"Rover Boys Series,\"  the two brothers just mentioned will need no special introduction. The  Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom  coming next, and Sam bringing up the rear. All were bright, lively,  up-to-date lads, and honest and manly to the core. They lived on a farm  called Valley Brook, in New York state,--a beautiful spot owned by their  uncle, Randolph Rover, and his wife, Martha. Their father, Anderson  Rover, also lived at the farm when at home, but he was away a great deal  on business.    From the farm the boys had been sent, some years before, to Putnam Hall,  an ideal place of learning, of which we shall learn more as our tale  proceeds. What the lads did there on their arrival has already been  related in \"The Rover Boys at School,\" the first volume of this series.    A short term at Putnam Hall was followed by a trip on the ocean, and  then a long journey to the jungles of Africa, in search of Anderson  Rover, who had disappeared. Then came a grand outing out west, and  another outing on the great lakes, followed by some stirring adventures  in the mountains of New York state.    Coming from the mountains, the three youths had expected to go back to  Putnam Hall at once, but fate ordained otherwise and they were cast away  in the Pacific Ocean, as related in \"The Rover Boys on Land and Sea.\"  They had a hard task of it getting home, and then returned to the school  and had some splendid times while in camp with the other cadets.    When vacation was once more at hand the boys soon solved the problem of  what to do. Their Uncle Randolph had taken a houseboat for debt. The  craft was located on the Ohio River, and it was resolved to make a trip  down the Mississippi.    \"It will be the best ever!\" Tom declared, and they started with much  enthusiasm, taking with them \"Songbird\" Powell, a school chum addicted  to the making of doggerel which he called poetry, Fred Garrison, a  plucky boy who had stood by them through thick and thin, and Hans  Mueller, a German youth who was still struggling with the mysteries of  the English tongue. With the boys went an old friend, Mrs. Stanhope, and  her sister, Mrs. Laning. With Mrs. Stanhope was her only daughter Dora,  whom Dick Rover considered the sweetest girl in the whole world, and  Mrs. Laning had with her two daughters, Grace and Nellie, especial  friends of Sam and Dick.    The trip on the houseboat proved a long and eventful one, and during  that time the boys and their company fell in with Dan Baxter, Lew Flapp  and several other enemies. On the Mississippi the craft was damaged, and  while it was being repaired the party took a trip inland, as related in  \"The Rover Boys on the Plains.\" Then the houseboat was stolen, and what  this led to has been related in detail in \"The Rover Boys in Southern  Waters.\" In that volume they brought to book several of the rascals who  had annoyed them, and they caused Dan Baxter to feel so ashamed of  himself that the bully made up his mind to reform.    Tired out from their long trip, the Rover boys were glad enough to get  back home again. For nearly a week their friends remained with them at  Valley Brook farm and then they departed, the Stanhopes and Lanings for  their homes and Fred, Hans and Songbird for Putnam Hall.    \"Of course you're coming back to the Hall?\" Fred had said on leaving.    \"Coming back?\" had been Tom's answer. \"Why, you couldn't keep us away  with a Gatling gun!\"    \"To be sure we'll be back,\" answered Dick Rover.    \"And we'll have the greatest times ever,\" chimed in Sam. \"I am fairly  aching to see the dear old school again.\"    \"And Captain Putnam, and all the rest,\" continued Tom.    \"And have some fun, eh, Tom?\" and Sam poked his fun-loving brother in  the ribs.    \"Well, when we go back we've got to do some studying,\" Dick had put in.  \"Do you know what father said yesterday?\"    \"No, what?\" came simultaneously from his brothers.    \"He said we were getting too old to go to Putnam Hall--that we ought to  be thinking of going to college, or of getting into business.\"    \"Hum!\" murmured Tom, and he became suddenly thoughtful.    \"I know why he said that,\" said Sam, with a wink at his big brother. \"He  knows how sweet Dick is on Dora, and----\"    \"Hi! you let up!\" cried Dick, his face reddening. \"It wasn't that at  all. We are getting pretty old for Putnam Hall, and you know it.\"    \"It seems I'd never want to leave the dear old school,\" murmured Tom.  \"Why, it's like a second home to us. Think of all the jolly times we've  had there--and the host of friends we've made.\"    \"And the enemies,\" added Sam. \"Don't forget them, or they may feel  slighted.\"    \"Dan Baxter was our worst enemy in that school, and he is going to  reform, Sam.\"    \"Perhaps. I won't feel sure of it until I really see it,\" answered the  youngest Rover.    \"By the way, I got a postal from Dan to-day,\" said Dick. \"He is in  Philadelphia, and working for a carpet manufacturer.\"    \"Well, if he's gone to work, that's a good sign,\" said Tom.    On their arrival at the farm the boys had been met by their father, but  now Anderson Rover had gone away on a business trip which was to last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22168"],[0,"The Golden Spears (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: \"She beckoned the children to her\"]              THE GOLDEN SPEARS    And Other Fairy Tales    BY    EDMUND LEAMY    ILLUSTRATIONS BY CORINNE TURNER          New York    Desmond FitzGerald, Inc.

This, then,  will be the third issue of the little book. I venture to predict that it  will not be the last; and I fancy the American publisher who has had the  judgment to take the matter up will soon be rewarded for his enterprise.  For I believe the book to be a little classic in its way, and that it  will go on making for itself a place in the libraries of those who  understand children, and will hold that place permanently.    This is the verdict of competent literary judges. I am spared the  necessity of attempting a discussion of the grounds on which so strong  an opinion of Leamy's fairy tales is based by the fact that this is  already done in Mr. T. P. Gill's Introductory Note. Mr. Gill, though he  was, like myself, one of Leamy's intimate friends, is a conscientious  critic, and to his analysis not merely of the \"Tales,\" but of that  attractive personality which Leamy infused into all he said or wrote  I can safely refer the reader. I think no one of taste and judgment who  reads these Tales will fail to agree with the view which is expressed in  that Note and which I here, with some confidence, venture to reiterate.    My chief hope with regard to this American edition is that when it has  made its mark with the general public, as it is sure to do, it will be  taken note of by those who are specially concerned with education.  Leamy, while a public man, a patriot steeped in the lore of Ireland's  past and ever weaving generous visions for her future, was before all  things else a child-lover. That was his own, his peculiar endowment.  He had an exquisite gift with children and seemed always able to speak  directly with the higher parts of their nature. It is this, I think,  which is evident in every page of these Tales, and which gives the book  its unique character. One to whose judgment on an educational matter  I attach the greatest value writes to me these words: \"For refining  influence, for power to stimulate the sense of beauty, the tenderness,  the sentiment of nobleness of the child-soul, I can imagine no volume  more worthy of a place on the book-shelf of the people's schools.\"  Having myself often witnessed this influence at work, I can emphatically  indorse this opinion. I say I hope American educators may agree with it,  for if they do our educators here at home will follow so distinguished  a lead.    Of Edmund Leamy, in his personal aspect, I have already said something  in my preface to the Dublin edition. I need only add here that this  true-hearted Irishman had many friends on the American continent, and  that to them this little flower of his genius will be a vivid and  abiding souvenir of one of the most lovable of men.    If this book have the success in America which it deserves--and I hope  that success may be extended to Canada and the Australias--I believe a  charming and ennobling boon will have been conferred upon the child-life  of these great communities; and it will be a source of gratification to  those who were the author's friends and colleagues to think that that  gift came from one by whose side we had the honor to serve in Ireland's  struggles.    J. E. REDMOND.    Aughavannagh, _June, 1911_.          THE GOLDEN SPEARS      Once upon a time there lived in a little house under a hill a little old  woman and her two children, whose names were Connla and Nora. Right in  front of the door of the little house lay a pleasant meadow, and beyond  the meadow rose up to the skies a mountain whose top was sharp-pointed  like a spear. For more than halfway up it was clad with heather, and  when the heather was in bloom it looked like a purple robe falling from  the shoulders of the mountain down to its feet. Above the heather it was  bare and gray, but when the sun was sinking in the sea, its last rays  rested on the bare mountain top and made it gleam like a spear of gold,  and so the children always called it the \"Golden Spear.\"    In summer days they gamboled in the meadow, plucking the sweet wild  grasses--and often and often they clambered up the mountain side, knee  deep in the heather, searching for frechans and wild honey, and sometimes  they found a bird's nest--but they only peeped into it, they never  touched the eggs or allowed their breath to fall upon them, for next to  their little mother they loved the mountain, and next to the mountain  they loved the wild birds who made the spring and summer weather musical  with their songs.    Sometimes the soft white mist would steal through the glen, and creeping  up the mountain would cover it with a veil so dense that the children  could not see it, and then they would say to each other: \"Our mountain  is gone away from us.\" But when the mist would lift and float off into  the skies, the children would clap their hands, and say: \"Oh, there's  our mountain back again.\"    In the long nights of winter they babbled of the spring and summertime  to come, when the birds would once more sing for them, and never a day  passed that they didn't fling crumbs outside their door, and on the  borders of the wood that stretched away towards the glen.    When the spring days came they awoke with the first light of the  morning, and they knew the very minute when the lark would begin to  sing, and when the thrush and the blackbird would pour out their liquid  notes, and when the robin would make the soft, green, tender leaves  tremulous at his song.    It chanced one day that when they were resting in the noontide heat,  under the perfumed shade of a hawthorn in bloom, they saw on the edge  of the meadow, spread out before them, a speckled thrush cowering in  the grass.    \"Oh, Connla! Connla! Look at the thrush--and, look, look up in the sky,  there is a hawk!\" cried Nora.    Connla looked up, and he saw the hawk with quivering wings, and he  knew that in a second it would pounce down on the frightened thrush.  He jumped to his feet, fixed a stone in his sling, and before the whir  of the stone shooting through the air was silent, the stricken hawk  tumbled headlong in the grass.    The thrush, shaking its wings, rose joyously in the air, and perching  upon an elm-tree in sight of the children, he sang a song so sweet that  they left the hawthorn shade and walked along together until they stood  under the branches of the elm; and they listened and listened to the  thrush's song, and at last Nora said:    \"Oh, Connla! did you ever hear a song so sweet as this?\"    \"No,\" said Connla, \"and I do believe sweeter music was never heard  before.\"    \"Ah,\" said the thrush, \"that's because you never heard the nine little  pipers playing. And now, Connla and Nora, you saved my life to-day.\"    \"It was Nora saved it,\" said Connla, \"for she pointed you out to me,  and also pointed out the hawk which was about to pounce on you.\"    \"It was Connla saved you,\" said Nora, \"for he slew the hawk with his  sling.\"    \"I owe my life to both of you,\" said the thrush. \"You like my song, and  you say you have never heard anything so sweet; but wait till you hear  the nine little pipers playing.\"    \"And when shall we hear them?\" said the children.    \"Well,\" said the thrush, \"sit outside your door to-morrow evening, and  wait and watch until the shadows have crept up the heather, and then,  when the mountain top is gleaming like a golden spear, look at the line  where the shadow on the heather meets the sunshine, and you shall see  what you shall see.\"    And having said this, the thrush sang another song sweeter than the  first, and then saying \"good-by,\" he flew away into the woods.    The children went home, and all night long they were dreaming of the  thrush and the nine little pipers; and when the birds sang in the  morning, they got up and went out into the meadow to watch the mountain.    The sun was shining in a cloudless sky, and no shadows lay on the  mountain, and all day long they watched and waited, and at last, when  the birds were singing their farewell song to the evening"]]]
