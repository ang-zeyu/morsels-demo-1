The Divine Comedy, Volume 1, Hell [The Inferno]    by Dante Aligheri    Translated by Charles Eliot Norton          HELL          To    JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.    E come sare' io sense lui corso?    It is a happiness for me to connect this volume with the memory  of my friend and master from youth. I was but a beginner in the  study of the Divine Comedy when I first had his incomparable aid  in the understanding of it. During the last year of his life he  read the proofs of this volume, to what great advantage to my  work may readily be conceived.    When, in the early summer of this year, the printing of the  Purgatory began, though illness made it an exertion to him, he  continued this act of friendship, and did not cease till, at the  fifth canto, he laid down the pencil forever from his dear and  honored hand.    CHARLES ELIOT NORTON.      CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS,    1 October, 1891    The text followed in this translation is, in general, that of  Witte. In a few cases I have preferred the readings which the  more recent researches of the Rev. Dr. Edward Moore, of Oxford,  seem to have established as correct.        CONTENTS    CANTO I.

So many versions of the Divine Comedy exist in English that a new  one might well seem needless. But most of these translations are  in verse, and the intellectual temper of our time is impatient of  a transmutation in which substance is sacrificed for form's sake,  and the new form is itself different from the original. The  conditions of verse in different languages vary so widely as to  make any versified translation of a poem but an imperfect  reproduction of the archetype. It is like an imperfect mirror  that renders but a partial likeness, in which essential features  are blurred or distorted. Dante himself, the first modern critic,  declared that \"nothing harmonized by a musical bond can be  transmuted from its own speech without losing all its sweetness  and harmony,\" and every fresh attempt at translation affords a  new proof of the truth of his assertion. Each language exhibits  its own special genius in its poetic forms. Even when they are  closely similar in rhythmical method their poetic effect is  essentially different, their individuality is distinct. The  hexameter of the Iliad is not the hexameter of the Aeneid. And if  this be the case in respect to related forms, it is even more  obvious in respect to forms peculiar to one language, like the  terza rima of the Italian, for which it is impossible to find a  satisfactory equivalent in another tongue.    If, then, the attempt be vain to reproduce the form or to  represent its effect in a translation, yet the substance of a  poem may have such worth that it deserves to be known by readers  who must read it in their own tongue or not at all. In this case  the aim of the translator should be to render the substance  fully, exactly, and with as close a correspondence to the tone  and style of the original as is possible between prose and  poetry. Of the charm, of the power of the poem such a translation  can give but an inadequate suggestion; the musical bond was of  its essence, and the loss of the musical bond is the loss of the  beauty to which form and substance mutually contributed, and in  which they were both alike harmonized and sublimated. The  rhythmic life of the original is its vital spirit, and the  translation losing this vital spirit is at best as the dull  plaster cast to the living marble or the breathing bronze. The  intellectual substance is there; and if the work be good,  something of the emotional quality may be conveyed; the  imagination may mould the prose as it moulded the verse,--but,  after all, \"translations are but as turn-coated things at best,\"  as Howell said in one of his Familiar Letters.    No poem in any tongue is more informed with rhythmic life than  the Divine Comedy. And yet, such is its extraordinary  distinction, no poem has an intellectual and emotional substance  more independent of its metrical form. Its complex structure, its  elaborate measure and rhyme, highly artificial as they are, are  so mastered by the genius of the poet as to become the most  natural expression of the spirit by which the poem is inspired;  while at the same time the thought and sentiment embodied in the  verse is of such import, and the narrative of such interest, that  they do not lose their worth when expressed in the prose of  another tongue; they still have power to quicken imagination, and  to evoke sympathy.    In English there is an excellent prose translation of the  Inferno, by Dr. John Carlyle, a man well known to the reader of  his brother's Correspondence. It was published forty years ago,  but it is still contemporaneous enough in style to answer every  need,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#1)"],[1,"by David McClamrock              SUMMA THEOLOGICA    THIRD PART  [\"III,\" \"Tertia Pars\"]    Translated by  Fathers of the English Dominican Province    BENZIGER BROTHERS  NEW YORK  ________________________    DEDICATION    To the Blessed Virgin  Mary Immaculate  Seat of Wisdom  ________________________    NOTE TO THIS ELECTRONIC EDITION    The text of this electronic edition was originally produced by Sandra  K. Perry, Perrysburg, Ohio, and made available through the Christian  Classics Ethereal Library <http://www.ccel.org>. I have eliminated  unnecessary formatting in the text, corrected some errors in  transcription, and added the dedication, tables of contents,  Prologue, and the numbers of the questions and articles, as they  appeared in the printed translation published by Benziger Brothers.  Each article is now designated by part, question number, and article  number in brackets, like this:    > SECOND ARTICLE [I, Q. 49, Art. 2]    > Whether the Supreme Good, God, Is the Cause of Evil?    In a few places, where obvious errors appeared in the Benziger  Brothers edition, I have corrected them by reference to a Latin text  of the _Summa._ These corrections are indicated by English text in  brackets. For example, in Part I, Question 45, Article 2, the first  sentence in the Benziger Brothers edition begins: \"Not only is it  impossible that anything should be created by God....\" By reference  to the Latin, \"non solum _non_ est impossibile a Deo aliquid creari\"  (emphasis added), this has been corrected to \"Not only is it [not]  impossible that anything should be created by God....\"    This electronic edition also differs from the Benziger Brothers  edition in the following details (as well as the obvious lack of the  original page numbers and headers):    * The repetitive expression \"We proceed thus to the [next] Article\"  does not appear directly below the title of each article.    * Italics are represented by underscores at the beginning and end,  _like this._ Quotations and other \"quotable\" matter, however, are  ordinarily set off by quotation marks with no underscores in this  edition, in accordance with common English usage, even where they  were set in italics with no quotation marks in the Benziger Brothers  edition. Titles of books are set off by underscores when they appear  in the text with no parentheses, but not when the books are cited in  parentheses.    * Bible chapters and verses are cited with arabic numerals separated  by colons, like this: \"Dan. 7:10\"--not like this: \"Dan. vii. 10.\"  Small roman numerals have been retained where they appear in  citations to books other than the Bible.    * Any matter that appeared in a footnote in the Benziger Brothers  edition is presented in brackets at the point in the text where the  footnote mark appeared.    * Greek words are presented in Roman transliteration.    * Paragraphs are not indented and are separated by blank lines.    * Numbered topics, set forth at the beginning of each question and  at certain other places, are ordinarily presented on a separate line  for each topic.    * Titles of questions are in all caps.    Anything else in this electronic edition that does not correspond to  the content of the Benziger Brothers edition may be regarded as a  defect in this edition and attributed to me (David McClamrock).  _______________________    CONTENTS    THIRD PART (QQ. 1-90)    Question    1.

Concerning this we must consider (1) the Saviour Himself; (2) the  sacraments by which we attain to our salvation; (3) the end of  immortal life to which we attain by the resurrection.    Concerning the first, a double consideration occurs: the first, about  the mystery of the Incarnation itself, whereby God was made man for  our salvation; the second, about such things as were done and  suffered by our Saviour--i.e. God incarnate.  _______________________    TREATISE ON THE INCARNATION (QQ. 1-59)  _______________________    QUESTION 1    OF THE FITNESS OF THE INCARNATION  (In Six Articles)    Concerning the first, three things occur to be considered: first, the  fitness of the Incarnation; secondly, the mode of union of the Word  Incarnate; thirdly, what follows this union.    Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:    (1) Whether it was fitting for God to become incarnate?    (2) Whether it was necessary for the restoration of the human race?    (3) Whether if there had been no sin God would have become incarnate?    (4) Whether He became incarnate to take away original sin rather than  actual?    (5) Whether it was fitting for God to become incarnate from the  beginning of the world?    (6) Whether His Incarnation ought to have been deferred to the end of  the world?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [III, Q. 1, Art. 1]    Whether It Was Fitting That God Should Become Incarnate?    Objection 1: It would seem that it was not fitting for God to become  incarnate. Since God from all eternity is the very essence of  goodness, it was best for Him to be as He had been from all eternity.  But from all eternity He had been without flesh. Therefore it was  most fitting for Him not to be united to flesh. Therefore it was not  fitting for God to"]]]
