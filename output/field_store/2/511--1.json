A    TREATISE    ON    ADULTERATIONS OF FOOD,    _AND CULINARY POISONS_.      EXHIBITING    The Fraudulent Sophistications of    BREAD, BEER, WINE, SPIRITOUS LIQUORS, TEA, COFFEE, CREAM, CONFECTIONERY,  VINEGAR, MUSTARD, PEPPER, CHEESE, OLIVE OIL, PICKLES,    AND OTHER ARTICLES EMPLOYED IN DOMESTIC ECONOMY.      AND    METHODS OF DETECTING THEM.      _By Fredrick Accum_,    OPERATIVE CHEMIST, AND MEMBER OF THE PRINCIPAL ACADEMIES AND SOCIETIES  OF ARTS AND SCIENCES IN EUROPE.      Philadelphia:  PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY AB'M SMALL  1820.          PREFACE.      This Treatise, as its title expresses, is intended to exhibit easy  methods of detecting the fraudulent adulterations of food, and of other  articles, classed either among the necessaries or luxuries of the table;  and to put the unwary on their guard against the use of such commodities  as are contaminated with substances deleterious to health.    Every person is aware that bread, beer, wine, and other substances  employed in domestic economy, are frequently met with in an adulterated  state: and the late convictions of numerous individuals for  counterfeiting and adulterating tea, coffee, bread, beer, pepper, and  other articles of diet, are still fresh in the memory of the public.    To such perfection of ingenuity has the system of counterfeiting and  adulterating various commodities of life arrived in this country, that  spurious articles are every where to be found in the market, made up so  skilfully, as to elude the discrimination of the most experienced  judges.    But of all possible nefarious traffic and deception, practised by  mercenary dealers, that of adulterating the articles intended for human  food with ingredients deleterious to health, is the most criminal, and,  in the mind of every honest man, must excite feelings of regret and  disgust. Numerous facts are on record, of human food, contaminated with  poisonous ingredients, having been vended to the public; and the annals  of medicine record tragical events ensuing from the use of such food.    The eager and insatiable thirst for gain, is proof against prohibitions  and penalties; and the possible sacrifice of a fellow-creature's life,  is a secondary consideration among unprincipled dealers.    However invidious the office may appear, and however painful the duty  may be, of exposing the names of individuals, who have been convicted of  adulterating food; yet it was necessary, for the verification of my  statement, that cases should be adduced in their support; and I have  carefully avoided citing any, except those which are authenticated in  Parliamentary documents and other public records.    To render this Treatise still more useful, I have also animadverted on  certain material errors, sometimes unconsciously committed through  accident or ignorance, in private families, during the preparation of  various articles of food, and of delicacies for the table.    In stating the experimental proceedings necessary for the detection of  the frauds which it has been my object to expose, I have confined myself  to the task of pointing out such operations only as may be performed by  persons unacquainted with chemical science; and it has been my purpose  to express all necessary rules and instructions in the plainest  language, divested of those recondite terms of science, which would be  out of place in a work intended for general perusal.    The design of the Treatise will be fully answered, if the views here  given should induce a single reader to pursue the object for which it  is published; or if it should tend to impress on the mind of the Public  the magnitude of an evil, which, in many cases, prevails to an extent so  alarming, that we may exclaim with the sons of the Prophet,         \"_THERE IS DEATH IN THE POT._\"    For the abolition of such nefarious practices, it is the interest of all  classes of the community to co-operate.

Once or twice she had peeped into the  book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in  it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures or  conversations?\"    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the  day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of  making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and  picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran  close by her.    There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so  very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh  dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch  out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice  started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take  out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after  it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under  the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!    [Illustration]    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then  dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think  about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed  to be a very deep well.    Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had  plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to  make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;  then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were  filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and  pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as  she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to her great  disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so  managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.    Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing  else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me  very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope  they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish  you were down here with me!\" Alice felt that she was dozing off, when  suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry  leaves, and the fall was over.    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up,  but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and  the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a  moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to  hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late  it's getting!\" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but  the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.    She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of  lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but  they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side  and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,  wondering how she was ever to get out again.    Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There  was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that  this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the  locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it  would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came  upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a  little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key  in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!    [Illustration]    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not  much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage  into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of  that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and  those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the  doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\"    Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on  it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like  telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly  was not here before,\" said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the  bottle was a paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed  on it in large letters.    \"No, I'll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_'  or not,\" for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle  marked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or  later. However, this bottle was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured  to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of  cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered  toast), she very soon finished it off.           *       *       *       *       *    \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like a  telescope!\"    And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face  brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going  through the little door into that lovely garden.    After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going  into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the  door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she  went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach  it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her  best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,  and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing  sat down and cried.    \"Come, there's no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather  sharply. \"I advise you to leave off this minute!\" She generally gave  herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and  sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her  eyes.    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:  she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT  ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, I'll eat it,\" said  Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it  makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I'll  get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\"    She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which  way?\" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was  growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same  size. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.    [Illustration]          II--THE POOL OF TEARS      \"Curiouser and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). \"Now I'm  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh,  my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings  for you now, dears? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble  myself about you.\"    Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in  fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.    Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to  look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more  hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.    She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all  'round her and reaching half down the hall.    After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and  she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White  Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in  one hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a  great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh!  _won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\"    When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If  you please, sir--\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white  kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he  could go.    [Illustration]    Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the  time she went on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got  up this morning? But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in  the world am I?' Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!\"    As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while  she was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she thought. \"I must be  growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table to measure  herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was  going on shrinking rapidly."]]]
