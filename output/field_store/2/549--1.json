LONDON    THE GROLIER SOCIETY    PUBLISHERS    [Illustration: Frontispiece]    [Illustration: Titlepage]        EDITOR'S PREFACE    Professor Maspero does not need to be introduced to us. His name is  well known in England and America as that of one of the chief masters of  Egyptian science as well as of ancient Oriental history and archaeology.  Alike as a philologist, a historian, and an archaeologist, he occupies  a foremost place in the annals of modern knowledge and research. He  possesses that quick apprehension and fertility of resource without  which the decipherment of ancient texts is impossible, and he also  possesses a sympathy with the past and a power of realizing it which are  indispensable if we would picture it aright. His intimate acquaintance  with Egypt and its literature, and the opportunities of discovery  afforded him by his position for several years as director of the Bulaq  Museum, give him an unique claim to speak with authority on the history  of the valley of the Nile. In the present work he has been prodigal of  his abundant stores of learning and knowledge, and it may therefore be  regarded as the most complete account of ancient Egypt that has ever yet  been published.    In the case of Babylonia and Assyria he no longer, it is true, speaks  at first hand. But he has thoroughly studied the latest and best  authorities on the subject, and has weighed their statements with the  judgment which comes from an exhaustive acquaintance with a similar  department of knowledge.    Naturally, in progressive studies like those of Egyptology and  Assyriology, a good many theories and conclusions must be tentative and  provisional only. Discovery crowds so quickly on discovery, that the  truth of to-day is often apt to be modified or amplified by the truth  of to-morrow. A single fresh fact may throw a wholly new and unexpected  light upon the results we have already gained, and cause them to assume  a somewhat changed aspect. But this is what must happen in all sciences  in which there is a healthy growth, and archaeological science is no  exception to the rule.    The spelling of ancient Egyptian proper names adopted by Professor  Maspero will perhaps seem strange to many. But it must be remembered  that all our attempts to represent the pronunciation of ancient Egyptian  words can be approximate only; we can never ascertain with certainty how  they were actually sounded. All that can be done is to determine what  pronunciation was assigned to them in the Greek period, and to work  backwards from this, so far as it is possible, to more remote ages.  This is what Professor Maspero has done, and it must be no slight  satisfaction to him to find that on the whole his system of  transliteration is confirmed by the cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna.    The difficulties attaching to the spelling of Assyrian names are  different from those which beset our attempts to reproduce, even  approximately, the names of ancient Egypt. The cuneiform system of  writing was syllabic, each character denoting a syllable, so that we  know what were the vowels in a proper name as well as the consonants.  Moreover, the pronunciation of the consonants resembled that of the  Hebrew consonants, the transliteration of which has long since become  conventional. When, therefore, an Assyrian or Babylonian name is written  phonetically, its correct transliteration is not often a matter  of question. But, unfortunately, the names are not always written  phonetically. The cuneiform script was an inheritance from the  non-Semitic predecessors of the Semites in Babylonia, and in this script  the characters represented words as well as sounds. Not unfrequently  the Semitic Assyrians continued to write a name in the old Sumerian way  instead of spelling it phonetically, the result being that we do not  know how it was pronounced in their own language. The name of the  Chaldaean Noab, for instance, is written with two characters which  ideographically signify \"the sun\" or \"day of life,\" and of the first of  which the Sumerian values were _ut, babar, khis, tarn,_ and _par_,  while the second had the value of _zi_. Were it not that the Chaldaean  historian Berossos writes the name Xisuthros, we should have no clue to  its Semitic pronunciation.    Professor Maspero's learning and indefatigable industry are well known  to me, but I confess I was not prepared for the exhaustive acquaintance  he shows with Assyriological literature. Nothing seems to have escaped  his notice. Papers and books just published, and half forgotten articles  in obscure periodicals which appeared years ago, have all alike been  used and quoted by him. Naturally, however, there are some points on  which I should be inclined to differ from the conclusions he draws,  or to which he has been led by other Assyriologists. Without being an  Assyriologist himself, it was impossible for him to be acquainted with  that portion of the evidence on certain disputed questions which is only  to be found in still unpublished or untranslated inscriptions.    There are two points which seem to me of sufficient importance  to justify my expression of dissent from his views. These are the  geographical situation of the land of Magan, and the historical  character of the annals of Sargon of Accad. The evidence about Magan is  very clear. Magan is usually associated with the country of Melukhkha,  \"the salt\" desert, and in _every_ text in which its geographical  position is indicated it is placed in the immediate vicinity of Egypt.  Thus Assur-bani-pal, after stating that he had \"gone to the lands of  Magan and Melukhkha,\" goes on to say that he \"directed his road to  Egypt and Kush,\" and then describes the first of his Egyptian campaigns.  Similar testimony is borne by Esar-haddon. The latter king tells us that  after quitting Egypt he directed his road to the land of Melukhkha, a  desert region in which there were no rivers, and which extended \"to the  city of Rapikh\" (the modern Raphia) \"at the edge of the wadi of Egypt\"  (the present Wadi El-Arish). After this he received camels from the king  of the Arabs, and made his way to the land and city of Magan. The Tel  el-Amarna tablets enable us to carry the record back to the fifteenth  century b.c. In certain of the tablets now as Berlin (Winckler and Abel,  42 and 45) the Phoenician governor of the Pharaoh asks that help should  be sent him from Melukhkha and Egypt: \"The king should hear the words of  his servant, and send ten men of the country of Melukhkha and twenty men  of the country of Egypt to defend the city [of Gebal] for the king.\" And  again, \"I have sent [to] Pharaoh\" (literally, \"the great house\") \"for a  garrison of men from the country of Melukhkha, and... the king has  just despatched a garrison [from] the country of Melukhkha.\" At a still  earlier date we have indications that Melukhkha and Magan denoted the  same region of the world. In an old Babylonian geographical list which  belongs to the early days of Chaldsean history, Magan is described as  \"the country of bronze,\" and Melukhkha as \"the country of the _samdu_,\"  or \"malachite.\" It was this list which originally led Oppert, Lenormant,  and myself independently to the conviction that Magan was to be looked  for in the Sinaitic Peninsula. Magan included, however, the Midian of  Scripture, and the city of Magan, called Makkan in Semitic Assyrian, is  probably the Makna of classical geography, now represented by the ruins  of Mukna.    As I have always maintained the historical character of the annals of  Sargon of Accad, long before recent discoveries led Professor Hilprecht  and others to adopt the same view, it is as well to state why I  consider them worthy of credit. In themselves the annals contain  nothing improbable; indeed, what might seem the most unlikely portion  of them--that which describes the extension of Sargon's empire to the  shores of the Mediterranean--has been confirmed by the progress of  research. Ammi-satana, a king of the first dynasty of Babylon (about  2200 B.C.), calls himself \"king of the country of the Amorites,\" and  the Tel el-Amarna tablets have revealed to us how deep and long-lasting  Babylonian influence must have been throughout Western Asia. Moreover,  the vase described by Professor Maspero in the present work proves that  the expedition of Naram-Sin against Magan was an historical reality, and  such an expedition was only possible if \"the land of the Amorites,\" the  Syria and Palestine of later days, had been secured in the rear.  But what chiefly led me to the belief that the annals are a document  contemporaneous with the events narrated in them, are two facts which  do not seem to have been sufficiently considered. On the one side, while  the annals of Sargon are given in full, those of his son Naram-Sin break  off abruptly in the early part of his reign. I see no explanation of  this, except that they were composed while Naram-Sin was still on the  throne. On the other side, the campaigns of the two monarchs are coupled  with the astrological phenomena on which the success of the campaigns  was supposed to depend. We know that the Babylonians were given to the  practice and study of astrology from the earliest days of their history;  we know also that even in the time of the later Assyrian monarchy it was  still customary for the general in the field to be accompanied by  the _asipu_, or \"prophet,\" the ashshaph"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19406"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXXVI., No. 8, February 24, 1877 (#1)"],[1,"Team at www.pgdp.net            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN          A WEEKLY JOURNAL OF PRACTICAL INFORMATION, ART, SCIENCE, MECHANICS,  CHEMISTRY, AND MANUFACTURES.
