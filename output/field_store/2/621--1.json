Such discussions are of the highest interest to the anthropologist and  to the psychologist; but they have the disadvantage of fixing our  attention too exclusively on what, to the ordinary Greek, appeared  accidental or even morbid, and of making us regard the Olympian  pantheon, with its clearly realised figures of the gods, as a mere  system imposed more or less from outside upon the old rites and beliefs  of the people. In the province of art, at least, the Olympian gods are  paramount; and thus we are led to appreciate and to understand their  worship as it affected the religious ideals of the people and the  services of the State. For we must remember that in the case of religion  even more than in that of art, its essential character and its influence  upon life and thought lie rather in its full perfection than in its  origin.    In a short sketch of so wide a subject it has seemed inadvisable to make  any attempt to describe the types of the various gods. Without full  illustration and a considerable expenditure of space, such a description  would be impracticable, and the reader must be referred to the ordinary  handbooks of the subject. A fuller account will be found in Dr.  Farnell's _Cults of the Greek States_, and some selected types are  discussed with the greatest subtlety and understanding in Brunn's  _Griechische Gotterideale_. In the present volume only a few examples  are mentioned as characteristic of the various periods. It may thus, I  trust, serve as an introduction to a more complete study of the subject;  and may, at the same time, offer to those who have not the leisure or  inclination for such further study, at least a summary of what we may  learn from Greece as to the relations of religion and art under the most  favourable conditions. It is easy, as Aristotle says, to fill in the  details if only the outlines are rightly drawn--[Greek: doxeie d' an  pantos einai proagagein kai diorthosai ta kalos echonta te perigraphe.]          CONTENTS      CHAPTER                                                           PAGE      I.

At the one extreme is the  uncompromising puritan spirit, which refuses to admit any devices of  human skill into the direct relations between God and man, whether it be  in the beauty of church or temple, in the ritual of their service, or in  the images which they enshrine. Other religions, such as those of the  Jews or of Islam, relegate art to a subordinate position; and while they  accept its services to decorate the buildings and apparatus connected  with divine worship, forbid any attempt to make a visible representation  of the deity. Modern Christianity, while it does not, as a rule, repeat  this prohibition, has varied greatly from time to time and from country  to country as to the extent to which it allows such representations.  Probably the better educated or more thoughtful individuals would in  every case regard them merely as symbolic aids to induce the  concentration and intensity of religious ideas and aspirations; but  there is no doubt that among the common people they tend to become  actually objects of worship in themselves. It is instructive to turn to  a system in which idolatry, the worship of images, was an essential part  of orthodox religious observance. It is easy and customary with a  certain class of minds to dismiss all such examples of idolatry with a  superficial generalisation such as \"the heathen in his blindness bows  down to stock and stone.\" But it seems worth while to devote a short  study to an attempt to understand how such a system worked in the case  of a people like the ancient Greeks, who possessed to a degree that has  never been surpassed both clearness of intellectual perception and a  power to embody their ideals in artistic form. Whether it tended to  exalt or to debase religion may be a doubtful question; but there can be  no doubt that it gave an inspiration to art which contributed to the  unrivalled attainments of the Greeks in many branches of artistic  creation. We shall be mainly concerned here with the religion of Greece  as it affected the art of sculpture; but before attempting a historical  summary it is necessary for us to understand exactly what we mean by the  worship of representations of the gods, and to consider the nature of  the influence which such representation must have upon artistic  activity.    Idolatry--the worship of images--is almost always used by us in a bad  sense, owing, no doubt, chiefly to the usage of the word in the Jewish  scriptures. Mr. Ruskin, in his chapter on the subject in his _Aratra  Pentelici_, points out that it may also be used in a good sense, though  he prefers to use the word imagination in this meaning. There is  doubtless a frequent tendency to failure to      \"Look through the sign to the thing signified,\"    but there is no essential reason why the contemplation of a beautiful  statue, embodying a worthy conception of the deity, should not be as  conducive to a state of worship and communion as is an impressive ritual  or ceremony, or any other aid to devotion. This view of the matter is  expressed by some later Greek writers; in earlier times it was probably  unconsciously present, though it is hardly to be found in contemporary  literature. But it was only by slow stages that art came to do so direct  a service to religious ideas; in more primitive times its relation was  more subordinate. The worship or service of images, even in the highest  ages of Greek civilisation, was much more associated with primitive and  comparatively inartistic figures than with the masterpieces of  sculpture; and even where these masterpieces were actually objects of  worship it was often from the inheritance of a sanctity transferred to  them from an earlier image rather than for their own artistic qualities.  It does not, indeed, follow that the influence of the great sculptors  upon the religious ideals of the people was a negligible quality; we  have abundant evidence, both direct and indirect, that it was very  great. But it was exercised chiefly by following and ennobling  traditional notions rather than by daring innovation, and therefore can  only be understood in relation to the general development both of  religious conceptions and of artistic facility.    Here we shall be mainly concerned with art as an expression of the  religious ideals and aspirations of the people, and as an influence upon  popular and educated opinions and conceptions of the gods. But we must  not forget that it is also valuable to us as a record of myths and  beliefs, and of ritual and customs associated with the worship of the  gods. This is the case, above all, with reliefs and vase-paintings. In  them we often find representations which do not merely illustrate  ancient literature, but supplement and modify the information we derive  from classical writers. The point of view of the artist is often not the  same as that of the poet or historian, and it is frequently nearer to  that of the people, and therefore a help in any attempt to understand  popular beliefs. The representations of the gods which we find in such  works do not often embody any lofty ideals or subtle characterisation;  but they show us the traditional and easily recognisable figures in  which the gods usually occurred to the imagination of the Greek people.    The association of acts of worship with certain specially sacred objects  or places lies at the basis of much religious art, though very often art  has little or nothing to do with such objects in a primitive stage of  religious development. Stocks and stones--the latter often reputed to  have fallen from heaven, the former sometimes in the shape of a growing  tree, sometimes of a mere unwrought log--were to be found as the centres  of religious cult in many of the shrines of Greece. These sacred objects  are sometimes called fetishes; and although it is perhaps wiser to avoid  terms belonging properly to the religion of modern savages in speaking  of ancient Greece, there seems to be an analogy between the beliefs and  customs that are implied. Such sacred stocks or stones were not regarded  merely as symbols of certain deities, but were looked upon as having  certain occult or magic qualities inherent in them, and as being in  themselves potent for good or evil. The ceremonies used in their cult  partook of the nature of magic rather than religion, so far as these  consisted of anointing them with oil or with drink offerings; such  ceremonies might, indeed, be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#1)"],[1,"Viswanathan, and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team  at http://www.pgdp.net                       [Illustration: \"Never mind the ink, old horse.

I merely wish to sketch for your benefit a portion of my  life's history. At eleven o'clock last night I went to bed, and at  once sank into a dreamless sleep. About four hours later there was a  clattering on the stairs which shook the house like a jelly. It was  the gentleman in the top room--I forget his name--returning to roost.  He was humming a patriotic song. A little while later there were a  couple of loud crashes. He had removed his boots. All this while  snatches of the patriotic song came to me through the ceiling of my  bedroom. At about four-thirty there was a lull, and I managed to get  to sleep again. I wish when you see that gentleman, Mrs. Medley, you  would give him my compliments, and ask him if he could shorten his  program another night. He might cut out the song, for a start.\"    \"He's a very young gentleman, sir,\" said Mrs. Medley, in vague defense  of her top room.    \"And it's highly improbable,\" said Garnet, \"that he will ever grow  old, if he repeats his last night's performance. I have no wish to  shed blood wantonly, but there are moments when one must lay aside  one's personal prejudices, and act for the good of the race. A man who  hums patriotic songs at four o'clock in the morning doesn't seem to me  to fit into the scheme of universal happiness. So you will mention it  to him, won't you?\"    \"Very well, sir,\" said Mrs. Medley, placidly.    On the strength of the fact that he wrote for the newspapers and had  published two novels, Mrs. Medley regarded Mr. Garnet as an eccentric  individual who had to be humored. Whatever he did or said filled her  with a mild amusement. She received his daily harangues in the same  spirit as that in which a nurse listens to the outpourings of the  family baby. She was surprised when he said anything sensible enough  for her to understand.    His table being clear of breakfast and his room free from disturbing  influences, the exhilaration caused by his chat with his landlady  left Mr. Garnet. Life seemed very gray to him. He was a conscientious  young man, and he knew that he ought to sit down and do some work. On  the other hand, his brain felt like a cauliflower, and he could not  think what to write about. This is one of the things which sour the  young author even more than do those long envelopes which so  tastefully decorate his table of a morning.    He felt particularly unfitted for writing at that moment. The morning  is not the time for inventive work. An article may be polished then,  or a half-finished story completed, but 11 A.M. is not the hour at  which to invent.    Jerry Garnet wandered restlessly about his sitting room. Rarely had it  seemed so dull and depressing to him as it did then. The photographs  on the mantelpiece irritated him. There was no change in them. They  struck him as the concrete expression of monotony. His eye was caught  by a picture hanging out of the straight. He jerked it to one side,  and the effect became worse. He jerked it back again, and the thing  looked as if it had been hung in a dim light by an astigmatic  drunkard. Five minutes' pulling and hauling brought it back to a  position only a shade less crooked than that in which he had found it,  and by that time his restlessness had grown like a mushroom.    He looked out of the window. The sunlight was playing on the house  opposite. He looked at his boots. At this point conscience prodded him  sharply.    \"I won't,\" he muttered fiercely, \"I will work. I'll turn out  something, even if it's the worst rot ever written.\"    With which admirable sentiment he tracked his blotting pad to its  hiding place (Mrs. Medley found a fresh one every day), collected ink  and pens, and sat down.    There was a distant thud from above, and shortly afterwards a thin  tenor voice made itself heard above a vigorous splashing. The young  gentleman on the top floor was starting another day.    \"Oi'll--er--sing thee saw-ongs\"--brief pause, then in a triumphant  burst, as if the singer had just remembered the name--\"ovarraby.\"    Mr. Garnet breathed a prayer and glared at the ceiling.    The voice continued:    \"Ahnd--er--ta-ales of fa-arr Cahsh-meerer.\"    Sudden and grewsome pause. The splashing ceased. The singer could  hardly have been drowned in a hip bath, but Mr. Garnet hoped for the  best.    His hopes were shattered.    \"Come,\" resumed the young gentleman persuasively, \"into the garden,  Maud, for ther black batter nah-eet hath--er--florn.\"    Jerry Garnet sprang from his seat and paced the room.    \"This is getting perfectly impossible,\" he said to himself. \"I must  get out of this. A fellow can't work in London. I'll go down to some  farmhouse in the country. I can't think here. You might just as well  try to work at a musical 'At Home.'\"    Here followed certain remarks about the young man upstairs, who was  now, in lighter vein, putting in a spell at a popular melody from the  Gaiety Theater.    He resumed his seat and set himself resolutely to hammer out something  which, though it might not be literature, would at least be capable of  being printed. A search through his commonplace book brought no balm.  A commonplace book is the author's rag bag. In it he places all the  insane ideas that come to him, in the groundless hope that some day he  will be able to convert them with magic touch into marketable plots.    This was the luminous item which first met Mr. Garnet's eye:    _Mem._ Dead body found in railway carriage under seat. Only one living  occupant of carriage. He is suspected of being the murderer, but  proves that he only entered carriage at twelve o'clock in the morning,  while the body has been dead since the previous night.    To this bright scheme were appended the words:    This will want some working up.    J. G.    \"It will,\" thought Jerry Garnet grimly, \"but it will have to go on  wanting as far as I'm concerned.\"    The next entry he found was a perfectly inscrutable lyric outburst.        There are moments of annoyance,      Void of every kind of joyance,        In the complicated course of Man's affairs;      But the very worst of any      He experiences when he        Meets a young, but active, lion on the stairs.    Sentiment unexceptionable. But as to the reason for the existence of  the fragment, his mind was a blank. He shut the book impatiently. It  was plain that no assistance was to be derived from it.    His thoughts wandered back to the idea of leaving London. London might  have suited Dr. Johnson, but he had come to the conclusion that what  he wanted to enable him to give the public of his best (as the  reviewer of the _Academy_, dealing with his last work, had expressed a  polite hope that he would continue to do) was country air. A farmhouse  by the sea somewhere ... cows ... spreading boughs ... rooks ...  brooks ... cream. In London the day stretches before a man, if he has  no regular and appointed work to do, like a long, white, dusty road.  It seems impossible to get to the end of it without vast effort. But  in the country every hour has its amusements. Up with the lark.  Morning dip. Cheery greetings. Local color. Huge breakfast. Long  walks. Flannels. The ungirt loin. Good, steady spell of work from  dinner till bedtime. The prospect fascinated him. His third novel was  already in a nebulous state in his brain. A quiet week or two in the  country"]]]
