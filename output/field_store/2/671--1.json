It was apparently entered into in all fun, though there are reports  that Lawson was bitter about it later.  'In Defence of the Bush',  included in this selection, was one of Paterson's replies to Lawson.]      [The 1913 printing (Sydney, Fifty-third Thousand) of the Second Edition  (first published in 1902) was used in the preparation of this etext.  First edition was first published in 1895.]          THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER AND OTHER VERSES    by A. B. Paterson (\"The Banjo\")    with preface by Rolf Boldrewood            Preface        It is not so easy to write ballads descriptive of the bushland of Australia  as on light consideration would appear.  Reasonably good verse  on the subject has been supplied in sufficient quantity.  But the maker of folksongs for our newborn nation requires  a somewhat rare combination of gifts and experiences.  Dowered with the poet's heart, he must yet have passed his 'wander-jaehre'  amid the stern solitude of the Austral waste -- must have ridden the race  in the back-block township, guided the reckless stock-horse  adown the mountain spur, and followed the night-long moving,  spectral-seeming herd 'in the droving days'.  Amid such scarce  congenial surroundings comes oft that finer sense which renders visible  bright gleams of humour, pathos, and romance, which,  like undiscovered gold, await the fortunate adventurer.  That the author has touched this treasure-trove, not less delicately  than distinctly, no true Australian will deny.  In my opinion  this collection comprises the best bush ballads written  since the death of Lindsay Gordon.    Rolf Boldrewood      A number of these verses are now published for the first time,  most of the others were written for and appeared in \"The Bulletin\"  (Sydney, N.S.W.), and are therefore already widely known  to readers in Australasia.    A. B. Paterson              Prelude             I have gathered these stories afar,        In the wind and the rain,       In the land where the cattle camps are,        On the edge of the plain.       On the overland routes of the west,        When the watches were long,       I have fashioned in earnest and jest        These fragments of song.         They are just the rude stories one hears        In sadness and mirth,       The records of wandering years,        And scant is their worth       Though their merits indeed are but slight,        I shall not repine,       If they give you one moment's delight,        Old comrades of mine.              Contents with First Lines:             Prelude          I have gathered these stories afar,         The Man from Snowy River          There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around         Old Pardon, the Son of Reprieve          You never heard tell of the story?         Clancy of the Overflow          I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better         Conroy's Gap          This was the way of it, don't you know --         Our New Horse          The boys had come back from the races         An Idyll of Dandaloo          On Western plains, where shade is not,         The Geebung Polo Club          It was somewhere up the country, in a land of rock and scrub,         The Travelling Post Office          The roving breezes come and go, the reed beds sweep and sway,         Saltbush Bill          Now this is the law of the Overland that all in the West obey,         A Mountain Station          I bought a run a while ago,         Been There Before          There came a stranger to Walgett town,         The Man Who Was Away          The widow sought the lawyer's room with children three in tow,         The Man from Ironbark          It was the man from Ironbark who struck the Sydney town,         The Open Steeplechase          I had ridden over hurdles up the country once or twice,         The Amateur Rider          _HIM_ going to ride for us!  _HIM_ --            with the pants and the eyeglass and all.

All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far      Had mustered at the homestead overnight,     For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,      And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.       There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,      The old man with his hair as white as snow;     But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up --      He would go wherever horse and man could go.     And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,      No better horseman ever held the reins;     For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand,      He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.       And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,      He was something like a racehorse undersized,     With a touch of Timor pony -- three parts thoroughbred at least --      And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.     He was hard and tough and wiry -- just the sort that won't say die --      There was courage in his quick impatient tread;     And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,      And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.       But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,      And the old man said, 'That horse will never do     For a long and tiring gallop -- lad, you'd better stop away,      Those hills are far too rough for such as you.'     So he waited sad and wistful -- only Clancy stood his friend --      'I think we ought to let him come,' he said;     'I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,      For both his horse and he are mountain bred.       'He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,      Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,     Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,      The man that holds his own is good enough.     And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,      Where the river runs those giant hills between;     I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,      But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.'       So he went -- they found the horses by the big mimosa clump --      They raced away towards the mountain's brow,     And the old man gave his orders, 'Boys, go at them from the jump,      No use to try for fancy riding now.     And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.      Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills,     For never yet was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21300"],[0,"Cowboy Songs, and Other Frontier Ballads (#1)"],[1,"http://www.pgdp.net.

Your subject is not only      exceedingly interesting to the student of literature, but also to      the student of the general history of the west. There is something      very curious in the reproduction here on this new continent of      essentially the conditions of ballad-growth which obtained in      mediaeval England; including, by the way, sympathy for the outlaw,      Jesse James taking the place of Robin Hood. Under modern conditions      however, the native ballad is speedily killed by competition with the      music hall songs; the cowboys becoming ashamed to sing the crude      homespun ballads in view of what Owen Writes calls the \"ill-smelling      saloon cleverness\" of the far less interesting compositions      of the music-hall singers. It is therefore a work of real importance      to preserve permanently this unwritten ballad literature of the back      country and the frontier.                              With all good wishes,                                   I am                                       very truly yours                                                      Theodore Roosevelt
