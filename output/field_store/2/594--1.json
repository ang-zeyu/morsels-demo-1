PREFACE      In offering this work to the public the publishers wish to lay before  those who sing or who are about to study singing, the simple,  fundamental rules of the art based on common sense. The two greatest  living exponents of the art of singing--Luisa Tetrazzini and Enrico  Caruso--have been chosen as examples, and their talks on singing have  additional weight from the fact that what they have to say has been  printed exactly as it was uttered, the truths they expound are driven  home forcefully, and what they relate so simply is backed by years of  experience and emphasized by the results they have achieved as the two  greatest artists in the world.    Much has been said about the Italian Method of Singing. It is a question  whether anyone really knows what the phrase means. After all, if there  be a right way to sing, then all other ways must be wrong. Books have  been written on breathing, tone production and what singers should eat  and wear, etc., etc., all tending to make the singer self-conscious and  to sing with the brain rather than with the heart. To quote Mme.  Tetrazzini: \"You can train the voice, you can take a raw material and  make it a finished production; not so with the heart.\"    The country is overrun with inferior teachers of singing; men and women  who have failed to get before the public, turn to teaching without any  practical experience, and, armed only with a few methods, teach these  alike to all pupils, ruining many good voices. Should these pupils  change teachers, even for the better, then begins the weary undoing of  the false method, often with no better result.    To these unfortunate pupils this book is of inestimable value. He or she  could not consistently choose such teachers after reading its pages.  Again the simple rules laid down and tersely and interestingly set forth  not only carry conviction with them, but tear away the veil of mystery  that so often is thrown about the divine art.    Luisa Tetrazzini and Enrico Caruso show what not to do, as well as what  to do, and bring the pupil back to first principles--the art of singing  naturally.          THE ART OF SINGING    By Luisa Tetrazzini    [Illustration: LUISA TETRAZZINI]          LUISA TETRAZZINI    INTRODUCTORY SKETCH OF THE CAREER OF THE WORLD-FAMOUS PRIMA DONNA      Luisa Tetrazzini, the most famous Italian coloratura soprano of the  day, declares that she began to sing before she learned to talk. Her  parents were not musical, but her elder sister, now the wife of the  eminent conductor Cleofante Campanini, was a public singer of  established reputation, and her success roused her young sister's  ambition to become a great artist. Her parents were well to do, her  father having a large army furnishing store in Florence, and they did  not encourage her in her determination to become a prima donna. One  prima donna, said her father, was enough for any family.    Luisa did not agree with him. If one prima donna is good, she argued,  why would not two be better? So she never desisted from her importunity  until she was permitted to become a pupil of Professor Coccherani, vocal  instructor at the Lycee. At this time she had committed to memory more  than a dozen grand opera roles, and at the end of six months the  professor confessed that he could do nothing more for her voice; that  she was ready for a career.    She made her bow to the Florentine opera going public, one of the most  critical in Italy, as Inez, in Meyerbeer's \"L'Africaine,\" and her  success was so pronounced that she was engaged at a salary of $100 a  month, a phenomenal beginning for a young singer. Queen Margherita was  present on the occasion and complimented her highly and prophesied for  her a great career. She asked the trembling debutante how old she was,  and in the embarrassment of the moment Luisa made herself six years  older than she really was. This is one noteworthy instance in which a  public singer failed to discount her age.    Fame came speedily, but for a long time it was confined to Europe and  Latin America. She sang seven seasons in St. Petersburg, three in  Mexico, two in Madrid, four in Buenos Aires, and even on the Pacific  coast of America before she appeared in New York. She had sung Lucia  more than 200 times before her first appearance at Covent Garden, and  the twenty curtain calls she received on that occasion came as the  greatest surprise of her career. She had begun to believe that she could  never be appreciated by English-speaking audiences and the ovation  almost overcame her.    It was by the merest chance that Mme. Tetrazzini ever came to the  Manhattan Opera House in New York. The diva's own account of her  engagement is as follows:    \"I was in London, and for a wonder I had a week, a wet week, on my  hands. You know people will do anything in a wet week in London.    \"There were contracts from all over the Continent and South America  pending. There was much discussion naturally in regard to settlements  and arrangements of one kind and another.    \"Suddenly, just like that\"--she makes a butterfly gesture--\"M.  Hammerstein came, and just like that\"--a duplicate gesture--\"I made up  my mind that I would come here. If his offer to me had been seven days  later I should not have signed, and if I had not I should undoubtedly  never have come, for a contract that I might have signed to go elsewhere  would probably have been for a number of years.\"    Voice experts confess that they are not able to solve the mystery of  Mme. Tetrazzini's wonderful management of her breathing.    \"It is perfectly natural,\" she says. \"I breathe low down in the  diaphragm, not, as some do, high up in the upper part of the chest. I  always hold some breath in reserve for the crescendos, employing only  what is absolutely necessary, and I renew the breath wherever it is  easiest.    \"In breathing I find, as in other matters pertaining to singing, that as  one goes on and practices, no matter how long one may have been singing,  there are constantly new surprises awaiting one. You may have been  accustomed for years to take a note in a certain way, and after a long  while you discover that, while it is a very good way, there is a  better.\"          Breath Control The Foundation of Singing      There is only one way to sing correctly, and that is to sing naturally,  easily, comfortably.    The height of vocal art is to have no apparent method, but to be able to  sing with perfect facility from one end of the voice to the other,  emitting all the notes clearly and yet with power and having each note  of the scale sound the same in quality and tonal beauty as the ones  before and after.    There are many methods which lead to the goal of natural singing--that  is to say, the production of the voice with ease, beauty and with  perfect control.    Some of the greatest teachers in the world reach this point apparently  by diverging roads.    Around the art of singing there has been formed a cult which includes an  entire jargon of words meaning one thing to the singer and another thing  to the rest of the world and which very often doesn't mean the same  thing to two singers of different schools.    In these talks with you I am going to try to use the simplest words, and  the few idioms which I will have to take from my own language I will  translate to you as clearly as I can, so that there can be no  misunderstanding.    Certainly the highest art and a lifetime of work and study are  necessary to acquire an easy emission of tone.    There are quantities of wonderful natural voices, particularly among the  young people of Switzerland and Italy, and the American voice is  especially noted for its purity and the beauty of its tone in the high  registers. But these naturally untrained voices soon break or fail if  they are used much unless the singer supplements the natural, God-given  vocal gifts with a conscious understanding of how the vocal apparatus  should be used.    The singer must have some knowledge of his or her anatomical structure,  particularly the structure of the throat, mouth and face, with its  resonant cavities, which are so necessary for the right production of  the voice.    Besides that, the lungs and diaphragm and the whole breathing apparatus  must be understood, because the foundation of singing is breathing and  breath control.    A singer must be able to rely on his breath, just as he relies upon the  solidity of the ground beneath his feet.    A shaky, uncontrolled breath is like a rickety foundation on which  nothing can be built, and until that foundation has been developed and  strengthened the would-be singer need expect no satisfactory results.    From the girls to whom I am talking especially I must now ask a  sacrifice--the singer cannot wear tight corsets and should not wear  corsets of any kind which come up higher than the lowest rib.    In other words, the corset must be nothing but a belt, but with as much  hip length as the wearer finds convenient and necessary.    In order to insure proper breathing capacity it is understood that the  clothing must be absolutely loose around the chest and also across the  lower part of the back, for one should breathe with the back of the  lungs as well as with the front.    In my years of study and work I have developed my own breathing capacity  until I am somewhat the despair of the fashionable modiste, but I have a  diaphragm and a breath on which I can rely at all times.

IN PARTICULAR                          This Work is Dedicated                      By a Humble Native of Flatland                             In the Hope that                Even as he was Initiated into the Mysteries                            Of THREE Dimensions                     Having been previously conversant                               With ONLY TWO                 So the Citizens of that Celestial Region                     May aspire yet higher and higher            To the Secrets of FOUR FIVE OR EVEN SIX Dimensions                           Thereby contributing                   To the Enlargement of THE IMAGINATION                       And the possible Development              Of that most rare and excellent Gift of MODESTY                         Among the Superior Races                             Of SOLID HUMANITY              Preface to the Second and Revised Edition, 1884.    By the Editor        If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed  when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to  represent him in this preface, in which he desires, firstly, to return  his thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland, whose appreciation  has, with unexpected celerity, required a second edition of his work;  secondly, to apologize for certain errors and misprints (for which,  however, he is not entirely responsible); and, thirdly, to explain one  or two misconceptions.  But he is not the Square he once was.  Years of  imprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general incredulity and  mockery, have combined with the natural decay of old age to erase from  his mind many of the thoughts and notions, and much also of the  terminology, which he acquired during his short stay in Spaceland.  He  has, therefore, requested me to reply in his behalf to two special  objections, one of an intellectual, the other of a moral nature.    The first objection is, that a Flatlander, seeing a Line, sees  something that must be THICK to the eye as well as LONG to the eye  (otherwise it would not be visible, if it had not some thickness); and  consequently he ought (it is argued) to acknowledge that his countrymen  are not only long and broad, but also (though doubtless in a very  slight degree) THICK or HIGH.  This objection is plausible, and, to  Spacelanders, almost irresistible, so that, I confess, when I first  heard it, I knew not what to reply.  But my poor old friend's answer  appears to me completely to meet it.    \"I admit,\" said he--when I mentioned to him this objection--\"I admit  the truth of your critic's facts, but I deny his conclusions.  It is  true that we have really in Flatland a Third unrecognized Dimension  called 'height', just as it is also true that you have really in  Spaceland a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, called by no name at  present, but which I will call 'extra-height'.  But we can no more take  cognizance of our 'height' than you can of your 'extra-height'.  Even  I--who have been in Spaceland, and have had the privilege of  understanding for twenty-four hours the meaning of 'height'--even I  cannot now comprehend it, nor realize it by the sense of sight or by  any process of reason; I can but apprehend it by faith.    \"The reason is obvious.  Dimension implies direction, implies  measurement, implies the more and the less.  Now, all our lines are  EQUALLY and INFINITESIMALLY thick (or high, whichever you like);  consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the  conception of that Dimension.  No 'delicate micrometer'--as has been  suggested by one too hasty Spaceland critic--would in the least avail  us; for we should not know WHAT TO MEASURE, NOR IN WHAT DIRECTION.  When we see a Line, we see something that is long and BRIGHT;  BRIGHTNESS, as well as length, is necessary to the existence of a Line;  if the brightness vanishes, the Line is extinguished.  Hence, all my  Flatland friends--when I talk to them about the unrecognized Dimension  which is somehow visible in a Line--say, 'Ah, you mean BRIGHTNESS':  and when I reply, 'No, I mean a real Dimension', they at once retort,  'Then measure it, or tell us in what direction it extends'; and this  silences me, for I can do neither.  Only yesterday, when the Chief  Circle (in other words our High Priest) came to inspect the State  Prison and paid me his seventh annual visit, and when for the seventh  time he put me the question, 'Was I any better?' I tried to prove to  him that he was 'high', as well as long and broad, although he did not  know it.  But what was his reply?  'You say I am \"high\"; measure my  \"high-ness\" and I will believe you.'  What could I do?  How could I  meet his challenge?  I was crushed; and he left the room triumphant.    \"Does this still seem strange to you?  Then put yourself in a similar  position.  Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension, condescending to  visit you, were to say, 'Whenever you open your eyes, you see a Plane  (which is of Two Dimensions) and you INFER a Solid (which is of Three);  but in reality you also see (though you do not recognize) a Fourth  Dimension, which is not colour nor brightness nor anything of the kind,  but a true Dimension, although I cannot point out to you its direction,  nor can you possibly measure it.'  What would you say to such a  visitor?  Would not you have him locked up?  Well, that is my fate: and  it is as natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for preaching  the Third Dimension, as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube  for preaching the Fourth.  Alas, how strong a family likeness runs  through blind and persecuting humanity in all Dimensions!  Points,  Lines, Squares, Cubes, Extra-Cubes--we are all liable to the same  errors, all alike the Slaves of our respective Dimensional prejudices,  as one of your Spaceland poets has said--         'One touch of Nature makes all worlds akin'.\"    [Note:  The Author desires me to add, that the misconception of some of  his critics on this matter has induced him to insert in his dialogue  with the Sphere, certain remarks which have a bearing on the point in  question, and which he had previously omitted as being tedious and  unnecessary.]    On this point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable.  I wish I could say that his answer to the second (or moral) objection  was equally clear and cogent.  It has been objected that he is a  woman-hater; and as this objection has been vehemently urged by those  whom Nature's decree has constituted the somewhat larger half of the  Spaceland race, I should like to remove it, so far as I can honestly do  so.  But the Square is so unaccustomed to the use of the moral  terminology of Spaceland that I should be doing him an injustice if I  were literally to transcribe his defence against this charge.  Acting,  therefore, as his interpreter and summarizer, I gather that in the  course of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modified his  own personal views, both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles  or Lower Classes.  Personally, he now inclines to the opinion of the  Sphere that the Straight Lines are in many important respects superior  to the Circles.  But, writing as a Historian, he has identified himself  (perhaps too closely) with the views generally adopted by Flatland, and  (as he has been informed) even by Spaceland, Historians; in whose pages  (until very recent times) the destinies of Women and of the masses of  mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of mention and never of careful  consideration.    In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow the Circular  or aristocratic tendencies with which some critics have naturally  credited him.  While doing justice to the intellectual power with which  a few Circles have for many generations maintained their supremacy over  immense multitudes of their countrymen, he believes that the facts of  Flatland, speaking for themselves without comment on his part, declare  that Revolutions cannot always be suppressed by slaughter, and that  Nature, in sentencing the Circles to infecundity, has condemned them to  ultimate failure--\"and herein,\" he says, \"I see a fulfilment of the  great Law of all worlds, that while the wisdom of Man thinks it is  working one thing, the wisdom of Nature constrains it to work another,  and quite a different and far better thing.\"  For the rest, he begs his "]]]
