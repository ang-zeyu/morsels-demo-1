CITY OF BENARES (_Troopship_).      _Tuesday, 8 P.M., August 18th._--Orders just gone round that there are  to be no lights after dark, so I am hasting to write this.    We had a great send-off in Sackville Street in our motor-bus, and went  on board about 2 P.M. From then till 7 we watched the embarkation going  on, on our own ship and another. We have a lot of R.E. and R.F.A. and  A.S.C., and a great many horses and pontoons and ambulance waggons: the  horses were very difficult to embark, poor dears. It was an exciting  scene all the time. I don't remember anything quite so thrilling as our  start off from Ireland. All the 600 khaki men on board, and every one on  every other ship, and all the crowds on the quay, and in boats and on  lighthouses, waved and yelled. Then we and the officers and the men,  severally, had the King's proclamation read out to us about doing our  duty for our country, and God blessing us, and how the King is following  our every movement.    We are now going to snatch up a very scratch supper and turn in, only  rugs and blankets.      _Wednesday, August 19th._--We are having a lovely calm and sunny  voyage--slowed down in the night for a fog. I had a berth by an open  port-hole, and though rather cold with one blanket and a rug  (dressing-gown in my trunk), enjoyed it very much--cold sea bath in the  morning. We live on oatmeal biscuits and potted meat, with chocolate and  tea and soup squares, some bread and butter sometimes, and cocoa at  bed-time.    There is a routine by bugle-call on troopships, with a guard, police,  and fatigues. The Tommies sleep on bales of forage in the after  well-deck and all over the place. We have one end of the 1st class cabin  forrard, and the officers have the 2nd class aft for sleeping and meals,  but there is a sociable blend on deck all day. Two medical officers here  were both in South Africa at No. 7 when I was (Captains in those days),  and we have had great cracks on old times and all the people we knew.  One is commanding a Field Ambulance and goes with the fighting line.  There are 200 men for Field Ambulances on board. They don't carry  Sisters, worse luck, only Padres.    We had an impromptu service on deck this afternoon; I played the  hymns,--never been on a voyage yet without being let in for that. It was  run by the three C. of E. Padres and the Wesleyan hand in hand: the  latter has been in the Nile Expedition of '98 and all through South  Africa. We had Mission Hymns roared by the Tommies, and then a C. of E.  Padre gave a short address--quite good. The Wesleyan did an extempore  prayer, rather well, and a very nice huge C. of E. man gave the  Blessing. Now they are having a Tommies' concert--a talented boy at the  piano.    At midday we passed a French cruiser, going the opposite way. They waved  and yelled, and we waved and yelled. We are out of sight of English or  French coast now. I believe we are to be in early to-morrow morning, and  will have a long train journey probably, but nobody knows anything for  certain except where we land--Havre.    It seems so long since we heard anything about the war, but it is only  since yesterday morning. (The concert is rather distracting, and the  wind is getting up--one of the Tommies has an angelic black puppy on  his lap, with a red cross on its collar, and there is a black cat  about.)      _Thursday, August 20th_, 5 P.M., _Havre._--We got in about 9 o'clock  this morning. Havre is a very picturesque town, with very high houses,  and a great many docks and quays, and an enormous amount of shipping.  The wharves were as usual lined with waving yelling crowds, and a great  exchange of Vive l'Angleterre from them, and Vive la France from us went  on, and a lusty roar of the Marseillaise from us. During the morning the  horses and pontoons and waggons were disembarked, and the R.E. and Field  Ambulances went off to enormous sheds on the wharf. We went off in a  taxi in batches of five to the Convent de St Jeanne d'Arc, an enormous  empty school, totally devoid of any furniture except crucifixes! Luckily  the school washhouse has quite good basins and taps, and we are all  camping out, three in a room, to sleep on the floor, as our camp kit  isn't available. No one knows if we shall be here one night, or a week,  or for ever! It is a glorious place, with huge high rooms, and huge open  casements, and broad staircases and halls, windows looking over the town  to the sea. We are high up on a hill. There's no food here, so we sit on  the floor and make our own breakfast and tea, and go to a very swanky  hotel for lunch and dinner. We are billeted here for quarters, and at  the hotel for meals.    A room full of mattresses has just been discovered to our joy, and we  have all hauled one up to our rooms, so we shall be in luxury.    Just got a French paper and seen the Pope is dead, and a very  enthusiastic account of the British troops at Dunkerque, their  marvellous organisation, their cheerfulness, and their behaviour.    Just seen on the Official War News placarded in the town that the  Germans have crossed the Meuse between Liege and Namur, and the Belgians  are retiring on to Antwerp. The Allies must buck up.    The whole town is flying flags since the troops began to come in; all  the biggest shops and buildings fly all four of the Allies.      _Friday, August 21st._--Intercession Day at home. There is a beautiful  chapel in the Convent.    There is almost as much censoring about the movement of the French  troops in the French papers as there is about ours in the English, and  not a great deal about the movements of the Germans.
