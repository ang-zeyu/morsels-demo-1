This plan has proved so successful in my later life that I  feel emboldened to offer it for the consideration of speakers and  singers.    While twenty-five years ago few of the principles here described were  acknowledged or even recognized, within the last decade almost all  have been advocated separately by different teachers or writers. At  the present time, therefore, originality consists only in the  classification of the principles into a systematic, progressive whole,  and in arranging a simpler and more practical method of applying them,  thus making the desired results much more quickly attainable.    It is attempted in this volume only to describe the value of each  element in the production of the perfect tone and to demonstrate the  principles which, if properly and faithfully applied, will develop the  best that is possible in each individual voice and prepare the pupil  to enter upon the more advanced arts of speaking and singing.    In 1903 I prepared a series of papers on _The Art of Vocalism_, which  were published in _The Etude_ in May, June, and July of that year.  These articles are incorporated in this work. In connection with  different organs and conditions, important principles are stated and  restated. This repetition is thought desirable in order that the  fundamentals may be kept prominently before the mind and impressed  upon the attention.    I believe that a careful study of this volume will prove of essential  service to teachers and advanced pupils of singing and oratory,  especially to young teachers just entering upon their duties. Its  method will be found adapted to the instruction of pupils of all  grades, from the kindergarten to the Conservatory of Music and the  School of Oratory.    I shall be gratified if this outcome of years of experience, constant  study, and tested methods shall prove helpful to those who seek  mastery of the art of beautiful speaking and singing.

At middle life I had given up all attempt at  singing and had difficulty in speaking so as to be heard at any  considerable distance or for any considerable length of time.  Professional obligations to my patients, however, compelled me later  to take up the subject of vocal physiology. This I did, guided by the  ideas current on the subject.    About 1880 I became satisfied that many of the current ideas were  incorrect, and determined to start anew, and to note in detail the  action of each organ used in vocalization and articulation. To this  end I sought vocal instruction and advice, which, modified by my own  observations, have produced the most gratifying results.    Up to that time it had been held that the nasal cavities must be cut  off from the mouth by the closing of the soft palate against the back  of the throat; that the passage of ever so little of the sound above  the palate would give a nasal twang, and that the sound was reinforced  and developed only in the cavities of the throat and mouth. My  practice in Oral Surgery, coupled with my own vocal studies exposed  this fallacy and revealed to me the true value of nasal resonance.    The late Mme. Rudersdorff had begun to recognize the effect of nasal  resonance, but she left no published record of her conclusions. It  does not appear that she or her contemporaries realized the true value  of the nasal and head cavities as reinforcing agents in the production  of tone, or appreciated their influence upon its quality and power.    There are perhaps few subjects on which a greater variety of opinion  exists than on that of voice culture, and few upon which so many  volumes have been written. Few points are uncontested, and exactly  opposite statements are made in regard to each.    Formerly great stress was laid upon the distinction between \"head  tones\" and \"chest tones,\" \"closed tones\" and \"open tones.\" The whole  musical world was in bondage to \"registers of the voice,\" and the one  great task confronting the singer and vocal teacher was to \"blend the  registers,\" a feat still baffling the efforts of many instructors.    Many teachers and singers have now reached what they consider a  demonstrated conclusion that registers are not a natural feature of  the voice; yet a large contingent still adhere to the doctrine of  \"register,\" depending for their justification upon the unreliable  evidence furnished by the laryngoscope, not realizing that there will  be found in the little lens as many different conditions as the  observers have eyes to see. Garcia himself, the inventor of the  laryngoscope, soon modified his first claims as to its value in vocal  culture.    On this point we have the testimony of his biographer, M.S. McKinley:    \"As far as Garcia was concerned, the laryngoscope ceased to be of any  special use as soon as his first investigations were concluded. By his  examination of the glottis he had the satisfaction of proving that all  his theories with regard to the emission of the voice were absolutely  correct. Beyond that he did not see that anything further was to be  gained except to satisfy the curiosity of those who might be  interested in seeing for themselves the forms and changes which the  inside of the larynx assumed during singing and speaking.\"    Of similar purport is the word of the eminent baritone, Sir Charles  Santley, who, in his _Art of Singing_, says:    \"Manuel Garcia is held up as the pioneer of scientific teaching of  singing. He was--but he taught singing, not surgery! I was a pupil of  his in 1858 and a friend of his while he lived;[1] and in all the  conversations I had with him I never heard him say a word about larynx  or pharynx, glottis or any other organ used in the production and  emission of the voice. He was perfectly acquainted with their  functions, but he used his knowledge for his own direction, not to  parade it before his pupils.\"    [Footnote 1: Garcia died July 1, 1906, at the age of 101.]    The eminent London surgeon and voice specialist, Dr. Morell Mackenzie,  says of the laryngoscope, \"It can scarcely be said to have thrown any  new light on the mechanism of the voice\"; and Dr. Lennox Browne  confesses that, \"Valuable as has been the laryngoscope in a  physiological, as undoubtedly it is in a medical sense, it has been  the means of making all theories of voice production too dependent on  the vocal cords, and thus the importance of the other parts of the  vocal apparatus has been overlooked.\"    Not only in regard to \"registers\" but in regard to resonance, focus,  articulation, and the offices and uses of the various vocal organs,  similar antagonistic opinions exist. Out of this chaos must some time  come a demonstrable system.    A generation ago the art of breathing was beginning to be more an  object of study, but the true value of correct lateral abdominal  breathing was by no means generally admitted or appreciated. It was  still taught that the larynx (voice-box) should bob up and down like a  jack-in-a-box with each change of pitch, and that \"female breathing\"  must be performed with a pumping action of the chest and the  elevation and depression of the collar bone.    Fortunately, teachers and singers recognized a good tone when they  heard it, and many taught much better than they knew, so that the  public did not have to wait for the development of accurate knowledge  of the subject "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19142"],[0,"The Devil Doctor (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                                                     THE                               DEVIL DOCTOR                          HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED ADVENTURES IN                       THE CAREER OF THE MYSTERIOUS                              DR.

I paused, my hand on the siphon, reflecting for a moment.    \"Two months ago,\" I said: \"he's a poor correspondent and rather  soured, I fancy.\"    \"What--a woman or something?\"    \"Some affair of that sort. He's such a reticent beggar, I really know  very little about it.\"    I placed a whisky and soda before the Rev. J. D. Eltham, also sliding  the tobacco jar nearer to his hand. The refined and sensitive face of  the clergyman offered no indication to the truculent character of the  man. His scanty fair hair, already grey over the temples, was silken  and soft-looking: in appearance he was indeed a typical English  churchman; but in China he had been known as \"the fighting  missionary,\" and had fully deserved the title. In fact, this  peaceful-looking gentleman had directly brought about the Boxer  Risings!    \"You know,\" he said in his clerical voice, but meanwhile stuffing  tobacco into an old pipe with fierce energy, \"I have often wondered,  Petrie--I have never left off wondering--\"    \"What?\"    \"That accursed Chinaman! Since the cellar place beneath the site of  the burnt-out cottage in Dulwich Village--I have wondered more than  ever.\"    He lighted his pipe and walked to the hearth to throw the match in the  grate.    \"You see,\" he continued, peering across at me in his oddly nervous  way--\"one never knows, does one? If I thought that Dr. Fu-Manchu lived;  if I seriously suspected that that stupendous intellect, that wonderful  genius, Petrie, er\"--he hesitated characteristically--\"survived, I  should feel it my duty--\"    \"Well?\" I said, leaning my elbows on the table and smiling slightly.    \"If that Satanic genius were not indeed destroyed, then the peace of  the world might be threatened anew at any moment!\"    He was becoming excited, shooting out his jaw in the truculent manner  I knew, and snapping his fingers to emphasize his words; a man  composed of the oddest complexities that ever dwelt beneath a clerical  frock.    \"He may have got back to China, doctor!\" he cried, and his eyes had  the fighting glint in them. \"Could you rest in peace if you thought  that he lived? Should you not fear for your life every time that a  night-call took you out alone? Why, man alive, it is only two years  since he was here amongst us, since we were searching every shadow for  those awful green eyes! What became of his band of assassins--his  stranglers, his dacoits, his damnable poisons and insects and  what-not--the army of creatures--\"    He paused, taking a drink.    \"You\"--he hesitated diffidently--\"searched in Egypt with Nayland  Smith, did you not?\"    I nodded.    \"Contradict me if I am wrong,\" he continued; \"but my impression is  that you were searching for the girl--the girl--Karamaneh, I think  she was called?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied shortly; \"but we could find no trace--no trace.\"    \"You--er--were interested?\"    \"More than I knew,\" I replied, \"until I realized that I had--lost  her.\"    \"I never met Karamaneh, but from your account, and from others, she  was quite unusually--\"    \"She was very beautiful,\" I said, and stood up, for I was anxious to  terminate that phase of the conversation.    Eltham regarded me sympathetically; he knew something of my search  with Nayland Smith for the dark-eyed Eastern girl who had brought  romance into my drab life; he knew that I treasured my memories of her  as I loathed and abhorred those of the fiendish, brilliant Chinese  doctor who had been her master.    Eltham began to pace up and down the rug, his pipe bubbling furiously;  and something in the way he carried his head reminded me momentarily  of Nayland Smith. Certainly, between this pink-faced clergyman, with  his deceptively mild appearance, and the gaunt, bronzed and  steely-eyed Burmese commissioner, there was externally little in  common; but it was some little nervous trick in his carriage that  conjured up through the smoke-haze one distant summer evening when  Smith had paced that very room as Eltham paced it now, when before my  startled eyes he had rung up the curtain upon the savage drama in  which, though I little suspected it then, Fate had cast me for a  leading role.    I wondered if Eltham's thoughts ran parallel with mine. My own were  centred upon the unforgettable figure of the murderous Chinaman. These  words, exactly as Smith had used them, seemed once again to sound in  my ears: \"Imagine a person, tall, lean and feline, high-shouldered,  with a brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan, a close-shaven  skull and long magnetic eyes of the true cat green. Invest him with  all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern race accumulated in one  giant intellect, with all the resources of science, past and present,  and you have a mental picture of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the 'Yellow Peril'  incarnate in one man.\"    This visit of Eltham's no doubt was responsible for my mood; for this  singular clergyman had played his part in the drama of two years ago.    \"I should like to see Smith again,\" he said suddenly; \"it seems a pity  that a man like that should be buried in Burma. Burma makes a mess of  the best of men, doctor. You said he was not married?\"    \"No,\" I replied shortly, \"and is never likely to be, now.\"    \"Ah, you hinted at something of the kind.\"    \"I know very little of it. Nayland Smith is not the kind of man to  talk much.\"    \"Quite so--quite so! And, you know, doctor, neither am I; but\"--he was  growing painfully embarrassed--\"it may be your due--I--er--I have a  correspondent, in the interior of China--\"    \"Well?\" I said, watching him in sudden eagerness.    \"Well, I would not desire to raise--vain hopes--nor to occasion, shall  I say, empty fears; but--er ... no, doctor!\" He flushed like a girl.  \"It was wrong of me to open this conversation. Perhaps, when I know  more--will you forget my words, for the time?\"    The 'phone bell rang.    \"Hullo!\" cried Eltham--\"hard luck, doctor!\"--but I could see that he  welcomed the interruption. \"Why!\" he added, \"it is one o'clock!\"    I went to the telephone.    \"Is that Dr. Petrie?\" inquired a woman's voice.    \"Yes; who is speaking?\"    \"Mrs. Hewett has been taken more seriously ill. Could you come at  once?\"    \"Certainly,\" I replied, for Mrs. Hewett was not only a profitable  patient but an estimable lady. \"I shall be with you in a quarter of an  hour.\"    I hung up the receiver.    \"Something urgent?\" asked Eltham, emptying his pipe.    \"Sounds like it. You had better turn in.\"    \"I should much prefer to walk over with you, if it would not be  intruding. Our conversation has ill prepared me for sleep.\"    \"Right!\" I said, for I welcomed his company; and three minutes later  we were striding across the deserted common.    A sort of mist floated amongst the trees, seeming in the moonlight  like a veil draped from trunk to trunk, as in silence we passed the  Mound Pond, and struck out for the north side of the common.    I suppose the presence of Eltham and the irritating recollection of  his half-confidence were the responsible factors, but my mind  persistently dwelt upon the subject of Fu-Manchu and the atrocities  which he had committed during his sojourn in England. So actively was  my imagination at work that I felt again the menace which so long had  hung over me; I felt as though that murderous yellow cloud still cast  its shadow upon England. And I found myself longing for the company of  Nayland Smith. I cannot state what was the nature of Eltham's  reflections, but I can guess; for he was as silent as I.    It was with a conscious effort that I shook myself out of this  morbidly reflective mood, on finding that we had crossed the common  and were come to the abode of my patient.    \"I shall take a little walk,\" announced Eltham; \"for I gather that you  don't expect to be detained long? I shall never be out of sight of the  door, of course.\"    \"Very well,\" I replied, and ran up the steps.    There were no lights to be seen in any of the windows, which  circumstance rather surprised me, as my patient occupied, or had  occupied when last I had visited her, a first-floor bedroom in the  front of the house. My knocking and "]]]
