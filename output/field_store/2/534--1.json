[January 20, 1947]            CALL TO FULLER PARTICIPATION      Acclaim with grateful heart evidences of steadily accelerating movement of  pioneers, multiplication of conferences, consolidation of activities of  national committees, progress in preliminaries of internal ornamentation  of Temple, and formulation of teaching policy in southern states.  Overwhelmed by tributes paid my own humble efforts by stalwart company  whose championship of Faith of Baha'u'llah during last quarter century  provided greatest support and solace, enabling me to sustain the weight of  cares and responsibilities of Guardianship.    Impelled to plead afresh to ponder responsibilities incurred in  transatlantic field of service. Time is flying. First year of Second Seven  Year Plan is drawing to a close. Shadow of war's tragic aftermath is  deepening. Initial stage of colossal task undertaken in European continent  still in balance. Urge stress for entire community extreme urgency to  reinforce promptly, at whatever cost, however inadequate the instruments,  the number of volunteers, both settlers and itinerant teachers, whom  posterity will rightly recognize as vanguard of torch-bearers of  Baha'u'llah's resistless, world-redeeming order to despairing millions of  diversified races, conflicting nationalities in darkest, most severely  tested, spiritually depleted continent of globe. Prayerfully awaiting  response by all ranks of community to supreme call to fuller participation  in glorious enterprise.    [January 30, 1947]            CONSOLIDATION IN EUROPE      Overjoyed, grateful, proud of notable expansion of manifold activities in  three continents. Vital significance of preeminent objective in European  continent cannot be overemphasized. Intense, sustained, self-sacrificing  efforts aimed at rapid consolidation of American Community's recently  initiated fate-laden transatlantic enterprise are urgent, imperative,  highly meritorious.

VOL. I. APRIL, 1895. No. 4.      BYZANTINE-ROMANESQUE WINDOWS IN  SOUTHERN ITALY.      The collection of photographs from which the plates in this and the  February number were selected was only recently made under the direction  of Signor Boni, an official of the Italian government, charged with the  care and restoration of historic monuments.    The province of Apulia has been so little invaded by the march of modern  improvement, and its present inhabitants are, as a rule, so poor, that  it is difficult to travel here except on the line of a few main  thoroughfares, and strangers seldom visit more than one or two of the  principal towns on the coast. Bari and Brindisi are known to tourists,  as they are in the line of travel to and from Greece, but the inland  towns are isolated in a barren priest-ridden country in which strangers  are not welcome. The hardships which it is necessary to face deter all  but the most adventurous even of the Italians, familiar with the  language and manners of the people. Architects seldom visit this  neighborhood, and little is known of its rich treasure of mediaeval  buildings, except through the few published works treating of it. Signor  Boni expressed himself as surprised at the great amount of beautiful  work scattered through this region, of which he previously had no  knowledge. The opinion of Fergusson has already been quoted in the  preceding article.    The mixture in the work here illustrated of Byzantine and Romanesque  elements has also been referred to in the preceding article, but the  special characteristics of each style were not particularly pointed out.  In the present consideration the peculiarities of detail and ornament  are all that need be taken up, as the views given furnish no opportunity  for the study of plan or general design. The derivation of the Byzantine  style was indicated in the March number of THE BROCHURE SERIES in  describing the Ravenna capitals there illustrated.    Byzantine conventional ornament appears to be of two types,--the one  usually used in mosaics, of thin scrolls, terminating in flowers or  symbols, displayed upon a ground which is much greater in quantity than  is the ornament; the other, usually confined to sculpture, an intricate  interlace of ribbon lines with spaces filled with Byzantine acanthus,  the ornament much greater in proportion than the ground, which only  shows in small separate pieces. Apart from these are the borders,  occasionally of overlapping leaves, often of small repeated units, such  as Greek crosses and squares and diamonds, or else meanders or  guilloches. The guilloche takes a new form in Byzantine design, and  instead of being a continuous succession of small circles enclosed in an  interlacing ribbon, it assumes the form of alternating small and large  circles, or of small circles alternating with large squares, and often  progressing in both directions at once, horizontally and  perpendicularly, and thus forming an all-over pattern. The roses of  ornament are often incorporated into this form of guilloche. Sculpture  of the human form becomes more and more feeble and crude. The acanthus,  however, went steadily through successive variation until it attained  the virile form seen in the best Byzantine work. It is no longer the  olive type of the Romans, or the heavy, stupid leaf of the earlier  centuries of the Christian era, but has again turned towards the  sharp-pointed, vigorous leaf of the Greeks. Its lobes are divided into  three or five tines, each sharp at the tip; its centre lines, radiating  from a central stem, bend like flames; its surfaces are concave, with  deep V cutting, and it has one very marked peculiarity, that is, that as  far as possible no tine is left displayed alone on the ground, but the  tip of each is made to touch either the tip of a neighboring tine or the  ribbon or moulding bounding the space in which the ornament occurs. The  tines are of nearly equal size throughout, and the spaces of ground left  by the ornament are also of comparatively equal size, and if possible  symmetrically grouped. The one almost universal moulding is decorated  with acanthus units, and the capitals have acanthus leaves around their  bells. These caps are of two types. One, that is manifestly an  adaptation of a classic cap, is a union of an Ionic and a Corinthian, or  at other times of a Roman Doric and a Corinthian capital. The other is  peculiar to Byzantine work, and is that shown in Plates XXI. to XXIV. in  the last number. This cap, as at S. Vitale, is often supplemented by  another plainer cap above. The lower cap has its faces decorated with  scrolls, acanthus wreaths, etc., and usually the corners are  strengthened with a decorative unit, leaf or other motive.    The difference between the Byzantine and the Romanesque arises from the  differences of the races and their environments. The art of seaport  towns, when Commerce was most largely carried on by sea, much more  nearly resembled the art of some great commercial centre on the  seaboard than it did that of its own neighbors inland.    The art of the seaboard cities in Europe was, then, for many years a  borrowed art from the East, as their people were to great extent Eastern  colonists. It was carried on with a full knowledge of constructive  methods, and a facility in obtaining materials that the inland towns did  not possess; and in consequence it is along the seaboard that is to be  found the persistence of the Byzantine influence. On the other hand, the  interior was peopled by descendants of Ostrogothic tribes mingling with  numberless local peoples. Whatever they touch is necessarily crude at  first, but constantly gaining as they gain facility in working. A  precedent of some kind they must have, and they find it close at hand in  the Roman basilicas. Uncertain, from the result of woful experiments, of  arches of great span, they pack their columns close together and  surmount them with sturdy little arches that have scarcely any thrust.  This arcade of heavy columns carrying absurdly disproportionate arches  is their only motive, and applied inside between aisles and nave, and  outside in successive stories rising one above another. As the masons  begin better to understand their art, the span of the arch increases,  though a large arch for some time does duty merely as a discharging  arch, and has smaller arches beneath and within it. The capitals, at  first crude imitations of classic prototypes, soon become the field for  the grotesque imagination of the workmen, and each differs from the  other and is a mass of light and shade shot with all sorts of uncouth  fancies. Wherever, for some constructive reason, a column is omitted  against a wall, the capital becomes a corbel, carrying the arches. In  many cases the corbels alone are used, and an arcaded corbel course  becomes the favorite termination of a wall in the place of a classic  entablature. Finally the arches are omitted, and the corbels alone  support the eaves.    It will be noticed that while the Byzantine decorated the interior of  the churches, the Romanesque builder merely constructed the interior and  wrought out the most of his design upon the facade. As a large arch was  to him for a long time a _tour de force_, he naturally beautified the  necessarily large entrance, and the beginning of the development of the  beautiful Gothic portals is seen in the early Romanesque churches.    The Romanesque is an architecture of inertia, with arches heavily  weighted by great masses of wall, and with broadly contrasting masses of  light and shade. It does not depend for its effect upon intellectual  quality beyond a rigorous sense of simplicity, or upon refinement of  conception or detail, but rather upon size, picturesque mass, and  staccato light and shade. The proportion of capital to column in  quantity of surface was very slight. The proportion of voussoirs to  arches naturally depended upon the size of the arch,--large voussoirs to  large arches, small voussoirs to small arches. Columns were only grouped  around piers and on either side of openings; and lastly, the natural  development of the column in Romanesque work was toward  attenuation,--the later and the better the work, the more slender became  the columns, until at last they were merged into the Gothic  multiple-columned piers. The carving upon the arch-mouldings is, to a  great extent, geometric, consisting of numerous facets cut in the stone,  lozenges, etc.; the so-called dogtooth moulding is a very favorite form  of decoration. All these carved mouldings were picked out in color,  usually in red and green. The acanthus in the Romanesque has lost much  of its vigor, is flat, heavy-tipped, round-edged, and scratched with  V-cuts, and the vine is the leaf preferred by designers. Frequently  masses of wall are cut in geometric diaper patterns, also touched with  color. Borders are not broad; and circular forms, except in the arches,  are seldom used. Romanesque was a barbaric art at the best, and has the  usual virtue of the barbarian,--a directness of attack at the problem in  hand and a simplicity in treating it which is invigorating to see.

TERESIA, TRANI, ITALY.    These two windows have very little to suggest Byzantine influence in  their design. The form and detail are essentially Romanesque, although  there is a certain crispness and piquancy of treatment in the first  (Plate XXV.) which belongs to the Byzantine work.
