And it has been proved that      their music-sense can be developed to a remarkable degree         21      A happy family of polar bears. The young cubs wrestle and tumble,      as playfully as two puppies. This play has much to do with their      physical and mental development                                   34      Dryptosaurus. The prehistoric animals, too, undoubtedly had their      play time, with games and \"setting up\" exercises                  35      The mother opossum is never happier than when she has her little ones      playing hide-and-seek over her back                               38      This young fox came from his home in the woods daily to play with a      young fox-terrier. He is now resting after a romp                 39      Naosaurus and Dimetrodon, two extinct armour-bearers who should      have been well able to protect themselves                         50      An armour-bearer of prehistoric times whose shield was an effective      protection against enemy horns                                    51      To the polar bear the ice and snow of the Far North means warmth      and protection. The mother bear digs herself into a snowbank,      where she lives quite comfortably throughout the winter           84      The sharp claws of the ground squirrel are efficacious tools in digging      his cosy underground burrow                                       85      The coyote can readily distinguish whether a herd of sheep is guarded      by one or more dogs, and will plan his attack accordingly         94      The zebu, the sacred bull of India, in spite of its domestication,      has an agile body and a quick, alert mind                         95      Roosevelt's Colobus. These horse-tailed monkeys chatter together in      a language exclusively their own, yet they seem to have no difficulty      in making themselves understood by other monkey-tribes           112      A tamed deer of Texas, whose constant companion and playmate was      a rabbit dog. Between the two, there developed, necessarily, a      common language                                                  113      Water-loving animals, like the beavers, seemingly take great pride in      their toilets. Their fur is always sleek and clean               122      Great forest pigs of Central Africa. Like the common domesticated      hogs, they will seek a clay bath to heal their wounds            123      The Rocky Mountain goat has many means of defence, not the least of      which is his agility in climbing to inaccessible places          134      Wild boars are among the most ferocious of animals. By means of      their great strength alone they are well able to defend      themselves                                                       135      Brontosaurus. The animals that seemed best equipped to defend themselves      are the ones that, thousands of years ago, became extinct        144      This prehistoric monster was equipped not only with a pair of strong      horns but with a shield back of them as well                     145      The beaver is the greatest of all animal architects. His skill is      equalled only by his patience (in Colours)                       158      The skunk mother tries to keep on hand a good supply of such delicacies      as frogs and toads, so that her young may never go hungry        172      The porcupine and the hedgehog have a unique method of collecting      food for their young. After shaking down berries or grapes,      they roll in them, then hurry home with the food attached to      their quills                                                     173      The black bear is not one of the great migrating animals. The thickness      of his coat must therefore change with the seasons               188      Rabbits seem to have a well-devised system in their road-building,      running their paths in and out of underbrush in a truly ingenious      manner                                                           189      The mongoose, a scavenger of the worst type, feeding on rats and      mice and snakes, and even poultry                                202      Diplodocus. The prehistoric animals, also, undoubtedly had their      scavengers and criminals                                         203      The Esquimo-dog is man's greatest friend in the Far North          218      Chipmunks are among the most easily tamed of man's wild friends,      and they even seem fond of human companionship                   219      Men cruelly take the lives of these denizens of the wildwood, rejoicing      in their slaughter, but the animal soul they cannot kill         244      Two pals. There is between man and dog a kinship of spirit that cannot      be denied                                                        245          FOREWORD      _\"And in the lion or the frog--    In all the life of moor or fen--    In ass and peacock, stork and dog,    He read similitudes of men.\"_    More and more science is being taught in a new way. More and more men  are beginning to discard the lumber of the brain's workshop to get at  real facts, real conclusions. Laboratories, experiments, tables,  classifications are all very vital and all very necessary but sometimes  their net result is only to befog and confuse. Occasionally it becomes  important for us to cast aside all dogmatic restraints and approach the  wonders of life from a new angle and with the untrammelled spirit of a  little child.    In this book I have attempted to bring together many old and new  observations which tend to show the human-like qualities of animals. The  treatment is neither formal nor scholastic, in fact I do not always  remain within the logical confines of the title. My sole purpose is to  make the reader self-active, observative, free from hide-bound  prejudice, and reborn as a participant in the wonderful experiences of  life which fill the universe. I hope to lead him into a new wonderland  of truth, beauty and love, a land where his heart as well as his eyes  will be opened.    In attempting to understand the animals I have used a method a great  deal like that of the village boy, who when questioned as to how he  located the stray horse for which a reward of twenty dollars had been  offered, replied, \"I just thought what I would do if I were a horse and  where I would go--and there I went and found him.\" In some such way I  have tried to think why animals do certain things, I have studied them  in many places and under all conditions, and those acts of theirs which,  if performed by children, would come under the head of wisdom and  intelligence, I have classified as such.    Life is one throughout. The love that fills a mother's heart when she  sees her first-born babe, is also felt by the mother bear, only in a  different way, when she sees her baby cubs playing before her humble  cave dwelling. The sorrow that is felt by the human heart when a beloved  one dies is experienced in only a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19855"],[0,"Louis' School Days: A Story for Boys (#1)"],[1,"http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously  made available by The University of Florida, The Internet  Archive/Children's Library)              LOUIS' SCHOOL DAYS,      A STORY FOR BOYS.    By E. J. May      [Illustration: Louis and Meredith on Brandon Hill. Page 76.]      NEW-YORK:  D. APPLETON & COMPANY, 200 BROADWAY.  1852.                PREFACE.      It was originally my intention to leave the child of my imagination  to make its way where it would, without any letter of introduction in  the form of the usual prefatory address to the reader; but having been  assured that a preface is indispensable, I am laid under the necessity  of formally giving a little insight into the character of the possible  inmate of many a happy home.    Reader, the following pages claim no interest on the score of  authenticity. They are no fiction _founded on facts_. They profess  to be nothing but fiction, used as a vehicle for illustrating certain  broad and fundamental truths in our holy religion.    It has often struck me, in recalling religious stories (to which I  acknowledge myself much indebted), that many of them fell into an error  which might have the effect of confusing the mind of a thinking child,  namely, that of drawing a perfect character as soon as the soul has  laid hold of Christ, without any mention of those struggles through  which the Christian must pass, in order to preserve a holy consistency  before men. This would seem to exclude the necessity of maintaining  a _warfare_.    The doctrine I have endeavored to maintain in the following pages is,  that man being born in \"sin, a child of wrath,\" has, by nature, all his  affections estranged from God; that, when by grace, through faith in  Christ, a new life has been implanted within him, his affections are  restored to their rightful Lord, every thought and imagination is  brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ; and his whole being  longs to praise Him who has called him \"out of darkness into light\"--to  praise Him \"not only with his lips, but in his life.\" Then commences the  struggle between light and darkness, between the flesh and the spirit,  between the old and new man; and the results of this conflict are seen  in the outward conduct of the Christian soldier.    The character of the child of God does not essentially alter, but a  new impulse is given him. Whatever good quality was in his natural  state conspicuous in him, will, in a state of grace and newness of  life, shine forth with double lustre; and he will find his besetting  sin his greatest hindrance in pressing forward to the attainment of  personal holiness. The great wide difference is, that he _desires_ to  be holy, and the Lord, who gives him this desire, gives him also the  strength to overcome his natural mind; and the more closely he waits  on his heavenly Father for His promised aid, the more holily and  consistently he will walk; and when, through the deceits of his heart,  the allurements of the world, or the temptations of Satan, he relaxes  his vigilance, and draws less largely from the fountain of his strength,  a sad falling away is the inevitable consequence. This warfare, this  danger of backsliding, ends only with the life, when, and when _only_,  he will be perfect, for he shall be like his Saviour.    As a writer for the young, I dare not plead even the humble pretensions  of my little volume in deprecation of the criticism which ought to be the  lot of every work professing to instruct others. In choosing the arena  of a boy's school for the scene of my hero's actions, I have necessarily  been compelled to introduce many incidents and phrases to which, perhaps,  some very scrupulous critics might object as out of place in a religious  work; but my readers will do well to recollect, that to be useful, a  story must be attractive, and to be attractive, it must be natural; and  I trust that they who candidly examine mine will find nothing therein  that can produce a wrong impression. It has not been without an anxious  sense of the great responsibility dependent on me in my present capacity,  that this little effort has been made. Should it be the instrument of  strengthening in one young one the best lessons he has received, it will,  indeed, not have been in vain. To the service of Him who is the strength  and help of all His people, it is dedicated.                  \"Be Thou alone exalted:            If there's a thought of favor placed on me--                THINE be it all!            Forgive its evil and accept its good--            I cast it at Thy feet.\"                                                          E.J.M.          CHAPTER I.      Doleful were the accounts received from time to time of Louis Mortimer's  life with his tutor at Dashwood Rectory; and, if implicit credence might  be yielded to them, it would be supposed that no poor mortal was ever so  persecuted by Latin verses, early rising, and difficult problems, as our  hero. His eldest brother, to whom these pathetic relations were made,  failed not to stimulate him with exciting passages of school life--and  these, at last, had the desired effect, drawing from Louis the following  epistle:        \"My dear Reginald,      \"Your letter was as welcome as usual. You cannot imagine what    a treat it is to hear from you. Mr. Phillips is kind, but so    very different from dear Mr. Daunton. What I dislike most is,    that he says so often, 'What _did_ Mr. Daunton teach you? I    never saw a boy so ignorant in my life!' I do not care how    much he says of me, but I cannot bear to hear him accuse dear    Mr. Daunton of not teaching me properly. I believe I am really    idle often, but sometimes, when I try most, it seems to give    least satisfaction. The other day I was busy two hours at    some Latin verses, and I took so much pains with them--I had    written an 'Ode to the Rising Sun,' and felt quite interested,    and thought Mr. Phillips would be pleased; but when I took it    to him, he just looked at it, and taking a pen dashed out word    after word, and said, so disagreeably, 'Shocking! Shocking,    Louis! Disgraceful, after all that I said yesterday--the pains    that I took with you,' 'Indeed, sir,' I said, 'I tried a great    deal,' 'Fine ideas! fine ideas! no doubt,' he said, 'but I have    told you dozens of times that I do not want _ideas_--I want    _feet_.' I wish those same feet would run away to Clifton with    me, Reginald; I hope I have not been saying any thing wrong    about Mr. Phillips--I should be very sorry to do so, for he    is very kind in his way: he tells me I do not know what I am    wishing for, and that school will not suit me, and a great deal    about my having to fag much harder and getting into disgrace;    but never mind, I should like to make the experiment, for I    shall be with you; and, dear as Dashwood is, it is _so_ dull    without papa and mamma--I can hardly bear to go into the    Priory now they are away. I seem to want Freddy's baby-voice    in the nursery; and sober Neville and Mary are quite a part    of home--how long it seems since I saw them! Well, I hope I    shall come to you at Easter. Do you not wish it were here?    I had a nice letter from mamma yesterday--she was at Florence    when she wrote, and is getting quite strong, and so is little    Mary. I have now no more time; mamma said papa had written    to you, or I would have told you all the news. I wanted to    tell you very much how our pigeons are, and the rabbits, and    Mary's hen, which I shall give in Mrs. Colthrop's care when    I leave Dashwood. But good bye, in a great hurry. With much    love, I remain your very affectionate brother,                                  \"LOUIS FRANCIS MORTIMER.      \"P.S. Do you remember cousin Vernon's laughing at    our embrace at Heronhurst? I wonder when I shall have    another--I am longing so to see you.\"      It would not concern my readers much were I to describe the precise  locality of the renowned Dr. Wilkinson's establishment for young  gentlemen--suffice it to say, that somewhere near Durdham Down,  within a short walk of Clifton, stood Ashfield House, a large  rambling building, part of which looked gray and timeworn when  compared with the modern school-room, and sundry dormitories, that  had been added at different periods as the school grew out of its  original domains. Attached to the house was a considerable extent  of park land, which was constituted the general play-ground.    At the time of which I am writing, Dr. Wilkinson's school consisted  of nearly eighty pupils, all of whom were boarders, and who were  sent from different parts of the kingdom; for the doctor's fame, as  an excellent man, and what, in the eyes of some was even a greater  recommendation, as a first-rate classical scholar, was spread far and  wide. At the door of this house, one fine April day, Louis presented  himself; and, after descending from the vehicle which brought him from  Bristol, followed the servant into the doctor's dining-room, where we  will leave him in solitary grandeur, or, more correctly speaking,  in agitating expectation, while we take a peep at the room on the  opposite side of the hall. In this, Dr. Wilkinson was giving audience  to a gentleman who had brought back his little boy a few minutes before  Louis arrived. Having some private business to transact, the child was  sent to the school-room, and then Mr. Percy entered into a discussion  respecting the capabilities of his son, and many other particulars,  which, however interesting to himself, would fail of being so to us.    At length these topics were exhausted, and it seemed nearly decided  how much was to be done or discontinued in Master Percy's education.  Mr. Percy paused to consider if any thing were left unsaid.    \"Oh! by the by, Dr. Wilkinson,\" he said, letting fall the pencil with  which he had been tapping the table during his"]]]
