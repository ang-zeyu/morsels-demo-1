(p. v)      It is perhaps a matter rather for regret than for surprise that so few  attempts have been made to describe, as a whole, the life and  character of Henry VIII. No ruler has left a deeper impress on the  history of his country, or done work which has been the subject of  more keen and lasting contention. Courts of law are still debating the  intention of statutes, the tenor of which he dictated; and the moral,  political, and religious, are as much in dispute as the legal, results  of his reign. He is still the Great Erastian, the protagonist of laity  against clergy. His policy is inextricably interwoven with the high  and eternal dilemma of Church and State; and it is well-nigh  impossible for one who feels keenly on these questions to treat the  reign of Henry VIII. in a reasonably judicial spirit. No period  illustrates more vividly the contradiction between morals and  politics. In our desire to reprobate the immorality of Henry's  methods, we are led to deny their success; or, in our appreciation of  the greatness of the ends he achieved, we seek to excuse the means he  took to achieve them. As with his policy, so with his character.    (p. vi)  There was nothing commonplace about him; his good and his bad  qualities alike were exceptional. It is easy, by suppressing the one  or the other, to paint him a hero or a villain. He lends himself  readily to polemic; but to depict his character in all its varied  aspects, extenuating nothing nor setting down aught in malice, is a  task of no little difficulty. It is two centuries and a half since  Lord Herbert produced his _Life and Reign of Henry VIII_.[1] The late  Mr. Brewer, in his prefaces to the first four volumes of the _Letters  and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII._, published under the direction  of the Master of the Rolls, dealt adequately with the earlier portion  of Henry's career. But Mr. Brewer died when his work reached the year  1530; his successor, Dr. James Gairdner, was directed to confine his  prefaces to the later volumes within the narrowest possible limits;  and students of history were deprived of the prospect of a  satisfactory account of Henry's later years from a writer of  unrivalled learning.                       [Footnote 1: The edition cited in the text is that                     of 1672.]    Henry's reign, from 1530 onwards, has been described by the late Mr.  Froude in one of the most brilliant and fascinating masterpieces of  historical literature, a work which still holds the field in popular,  if not in scholarly, estimation. But Mr. Froude does not begin until  Henry's reign was half over, until his character had been determined  by influences and events which lie outside the scope of Mr.        (p. vii)  Froude's inquiry. Moreover, since Mr. Froude wrote, a flood of light  has been thrown on the period by the publication of the above-mentioned  _Letters and Papers_;[2] they already comprise a summary of between  thirty and forty thousand documents in twenty thousand closely printed  pages, and, when completed, will constitute the most magnificent body  of materials for the history of any reign, ancient or modern, English  or foreign. Simultaneously there have appeared a dozen volumes  containing the State papers preserved at Simancas,[3] Vienna and  Brussels and similar series comprising the correspondence relating to  Venice,[4] Scotland[5] and Ireland;[6] while the despatches of French  ambassadors have been published under the auspices of the Ministry for  Foreign Affairs at Paris.[7] Still further information has been   (p. viii)  provided by the labours of the Historical Manuscripts Commission,[8]  the Camden,[9] the Royal Historical,[10] and other learned Societies.                       [Footnote 2: This series, unlike the _Calendars of                     State Papers_, includes documents not preserved at                     the Record Office; it is often inaccurately cited                     as _Calendar of State Papers_, but the word                     \"Calendar\" does not appear in the title and it                     includes much besides State papers; such a                     description also tends to confuse it with the                     eleven volumes of Henry VIII.'s State papers                     published _in extenso_ in 1830-51. The series now                     extends to Dec., 1544, and is cited in the text as                     _L. and P._.]                       [Footnote 3: Cited as _Spanish Calendar_; the                     volume completing Henry's reign was published in                     1904.]                       [Footnote 4: Cited as _Ven. Cal._; this                     correspondence diminishes in importance as the                     reign proceeds, and also, after 1530, the documents                     are epitomised afresh in _L. and P._.]                       [Footnote 5: Three series, _viz._, that edited by                     Thorp (2 vols., 1858), a second edited by Bain (2                     vols., 1898) and the _Hamilton Papers_ (2 vols.,                     1890-92).]                       [Footnote 6: Vol. i. of the _Irish Calendar_, and                     also of the _Carew MSS._; see also the _Calendar of                     Fiants_ published by the Deputy-Keeper of Records                     for Ireland.]                       [Footnote 7: _Correspondance de MM.

Mr. Froude has  expressed his concurrence in the dictum that the facts of history are  like the letters of the alphabet; by selection and arrangement they  can be made to spell anything, and nothing can be arranged so easily  as facts. _Experto crede_. Yet selection is inevitable, and  arrangement essential. The historian has no option if he wishes to be  intelligible. He will naturally arrange his facts so that they spell  what he believes to be the truth; and he must of necessity suppress  those facts which he judges to be immaterial or inconsistent with the  scale on which he is writing. But if the superabundance of facts  compels both selection and suppression, it counsels no less a  restraint of judgment.

To produce a good balance staff requires more skill than to produce any  other turned portion of a watch, and your success will depend not alone  on your knowledge of its proper shape and measurements, nor the tools at  your command, but rather upon your skill with the graver and your success  in hardening and tempering. There are many points worthy of consideration  in the making of a balance staff that are too often neglected. I have  seen staffs that were models as regards execution and finish, that were  nearly worthless from a practical standpoint, simply because the maker  had devoted all his time and energy to the execution of a beautiful piece  of lathe work, and had given no thought or study to the form and size of  the pivots. On the other hand, one often sees staffs whose pivots are  faultless in shape, but the execution and finish so bungling as to offset  all the good qualities as regards shape. To have good tools and the right  ideas is one thing, and to use these tools properly and make a practical  demonstration of your theory is another.    I shall endeavor to take up every point in connection with the balance  staff, from the steel to the jewels, and their relation to the pivots,  and I believe this will then convey to the reader all the necessary  points, not only as regards staffs, but pivots also, whether applied to a  balance or a pinion staff.    It may be argued, and we often do hear material dealers advance the  theory, that to-day, with our interchangeable parts and the cheapness of  all material, it is a waste of time to make a balance staff. To the  reader who takes this view of the situation I simply want to say, kindly  follow me to the end of this paragraph, and if you are still of the same  opinion, then you are wasting your time in following me farther. For a  material dealer to advance this theory I can find some excuse; he is an  interested party, and the selling of material is his bread and butter;  but the other fellow, well I never could understand him and possibly  never shall. When we seriously consider the various styles and series in  \"old model\" and \"new model,\" of only one of the leading manufacturers of  watches in this country, to say nothing of the legion of small and large  concerns who are manufacturing or have manufactured in the past, and then  think of carrying these staffs in stock, all ready for use, we then begin  to realize how utterly absurd the idea is, to say nothing of how  expensive! On the other hand, if you reside in a large city and propose  to rely on the stock of your material dealer, you will find yourself in  an embarrasing situation very often, for as likely as not the movement  requiring a new staff was made by a company that went out of business  back in the '80s, or it is a new movement, the material for which has  not yet been placed on the market. This state of affairs leads to  makeshifts, and they in turn lead to botch work. The watchmaker who does  not possess the experience or necessary qualifications to make a new  balance staff and make it in a neat and workmanlike manner, is never  certain of having exactly what is needed, and cannot hope to long retain  the confidence of his customers. In fact, he is not a watchmaker at all,  but simply an apprentice or student, even though he be working for a  salary or be his own master. There are undoubtedly many worthy members of  the trade, who are not familiar with the making of a balance staff, who  will take exceptions to this statement; but it is nevertheless true. They  may be good workmen as far as they go; they may be painstaking; but they  cannot be classed as watchmakers.    This article is intended for the benefit of that large class whose  opportunities for obtaining instruction are limited, and who are ready  and willing to learn, and for that still larger class of practical  workmen who can make a new staff in a creditable manner, but who are  always glad to read others people's ideas on any subject connected with  the trade and who are not yet too old to learn new tricks should they  find any such.    [Illustration: _Fig. 1._]    Good tools, in good condition, are the most essential requisites in  making a new staff. I would not advise any particular make of lathe, as  the most expensive lathe in the world will not produce a true staff if  the workman cannot center his work accurately and does not know how to  handle his graver, while on the other hand fine work can be done on the  simplest and cheapest lathe by a workman possessing the requisite skill.  I will take it for granted that you use an American-made lathe of some  kind, or a foreign-made lathe manufactured on American lines. It is  advisable, though not absolutely necessary, to have three gravers similar  to those illustrated in Fig. 1, A being used for turning the staff down  in the rough; B for the conical pivots and square shoulders and C for the  under-cutting. The other tools and attachments needed will be described  as I come to them in use.    The balance staff should be made of the best steel, tempered to such a  degree as to give the longest service and yet not so hard as to endanger  the breakage of the pivots. Select a piece of Stubb's steel wire, say No.  46, or a little larger than the largest part of the finished staff is to  be, and center it in a split chuck of your lathe. Be careful in selecting  your chuck that you pick one that fits the wire fairly close. The chuck  holds the work truest that comes the nearest to fitting it. If you try to  use a chuck that is too large or too small for the work, you will only  ruin the chuck for truth. Turn the wire to the form of a rough staff, as  shown in Fig. 2, leaving on a small part of the original wire, as shown  at A. After the wire is roughed out to this general form, remove from the  chuck and get ready to harden and temper it. The hardening and tempering  may be effected in various ways, and I am scarcely prepared to say which  method is the best, as there are several which give about the same  general results. One method of hardening is to smear the blank with  common yellow soap, heat it to a cherry red, and drop endwise into  linseed oil. Petroleum is preferred by some to linseed oil, but, to tell  the truth, I can see no difference in the action of linseed, petroleum or  olive oil. Be sure and have enough oil to thoroughly cool the blank, and  a deep vessel, such as a large-mouthed vial, is preferable to a saucer.  The blank will now be found too hard to work easily with the graver, and  we must therefore draw the temper down to that of fine spring steel.  Before doing this the blank should be brightened, in order that we may  see to just what color we are drawing it. The main object in using the  soap in hardening is that it may form a scale upon the blank, and if the  heating is effected gradually the soap will melt and form a practically  air-tight case around the blank. This scale, if the hardening is  carefully and properly done, will generally chip and fall off when the  blank is plunged in the oil, particularly if the oil is cool, and if it  does not fall off of its own accord, it can easily be removed by rolling  the blank upon the bench. If it does not come out clean, or if soap is  not used, it may be brightened by again inserting in the lathe and  bringing it in contact with a piece of fine emery paper or cloth.    [Illustration: _Fig. 2._]    I draw the temper in the following manner: Place some fine brass filings  in a boiling-out cup or bluing pan and lay the blank upon these filings,  holding the pan over the flame of an alcohol lamp until the blank assumes  a dark purple color, which it will reach when the heat gets to about 500 deg.  F. This I consider the right hardness for a balance staff, as it is not  too hard to work well under the graver nor too soft for the pivots. At  this degree of hardness steel will assume an exquisite polish if properly  treated. Another method of tempering is to place the staff on a piece of  sheet iron or copper (say 1 inch wide by 4 long), "]]]
