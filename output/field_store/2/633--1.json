[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2070"],[0,"To the Last Man (#1)"],[1,"The Last Man      by    Zane Grey            FOREWORD    It was inevitable that in my efforts to write romantic history of the  great West I should at length come to the story of a feud.  For long I  have steered clear of this rock.  But at last I have reached it and  must go over it, driven by my desire to chronicle the stirring events  of pioneer days.    Even to-day it is not possible to travel into the remote corners of the  West without seeing the lives of people still affected by a fighting  past.  How can the truth be told about the pioneering of the West if  the struggle, the fight, the blood be left out?  It cannot be done.  How can a novel be stirring and thrilling, as were those times, unless  it be full of sensation?  My long labors have been devoted to making  stories resemble the times they depict.  I have loved the West for its  vastness, its contrast, its beauty and color and life, for its wildness  and violence, and for the fact that I have seen how it developed great  men and women who died unknown and unsung.    In this materialistic age, this hard, practical, swift, greedy age of  realism, it seems there is no place for writers of romance, no place  for romance itself.  For many years all the events leading up to the  great war were realistic, and the war itself was horribly realistic,  and the aftermath is likewise.  Romance is only another name for  idealism; and I contend that life without ideals is not worth living.  Never in the history of the world were ideals needed so terribly as  now.  Walter Scott wrote romance; so did Victor Hugo; and likewise  Kipling, Hawthorne, Stevenson.  It was Stevenson, particularly, who  wielded a bludgeon against the realists.  People live for the dream in  their hearts.  And I have yet to know anyone who has not some secret  dream, some hope, however dim, some storied wall to look at in the  dusk, some painted window leading to the soul. How strange indeed to  find that the realists have ideals and dreams! To read them one would  think their lives held nothing significant. But they love, they hope,  they dream, they sacrifice, they struggle on with that dream in their  hearts just the same as others.  We all are dreamers, if not in the  heavy-lidded wasting of time, then in the meaning of life that makes us  work on.    It was Wordsworth who wrote, \"The world is too much with us\"; and if I  could give the secret of my ambition as a novelist in a few words it  would be contained in that quotation.  My inspiration to write has  always come from nature.  Character and action are subordinated to  setting.  In all that I have done I have tried to make people see how  the world is too much with them.  Getting and spending they lay waste  their powers, with never a breath of the free and wonderful life of the  open!    So I come back to the main point of this foreword, in which I am trying  to tell why and how I came to write the story of a feud notorious in  Arizona as the Pleasant Valley War.    Some years ago Mr. Harry Adams, a cattleman of Vermajo Park, New  Mexico, told me he had been in the Tonto Basin of Arizona and thought I  might find interesting material there concerning this Pleasant Valley  War. His version of the war between cattlemen and sheepmen certainly  determined me to look over the ground.  My old guide, Al Doyle of  Flagstaff, had led me over half of Arizona, but never down into that  wonderful wild and rugged basin between the Mogollon Mesa and the  Mazatzal Mountains.  Doyle had long lived on the frontier and his  version of the Pleasant Valley War differed markedly from that of Mr.  Adams.  I asked other old timers about it, and their remarks further  excited my curiosity.    Once down there, Doyle and I found the wildest, most rugged, roughest,  and most remarkable country either of us had visited; and the few  inhabitants were like the country.  I went in ostensibly to hunt bear  and lion and turkey, but what I really was hunting for was the story of  that Pleasant Valley War.  I engaged the services of a bear hunter who  had three strapping sons as reserved and strange and aloof as he was.  No wheel tracks of any kind had ever come within miles of their cabin.  I spent two wonderful months hunting game and reveling in the beauty  and grandeur of that Rim Rock country, but I came out knowing no more  about the Pleasant Valley War.  These Texans and their few neighbors,  likewise from Texas, did not talk.  But all I saw and felt only  inspired me the more.  This trip was in the fall of 1918.    The next year I went again with the best horses, outfit, and men the  Doyles could provide.  And this time I did not ask any questions. But I  rode horses--some of them too wild for me--and packed a rifle many a  hundred miles, riding sometimes thirty and forty miles a day, and I  climbed in and out of the deep canyons, desperately staying at the  heels of one of those long-legged Texans.  I learned the life of those  backwoodsmen, but I did not get the story of the Pleasant Valley War.  I had, however, won the friendship of that hardy people.    In 1920 I went back with a still larger outfit, equipped to stay as  long as I liked.  And this time, without my asking it, different  natives of the Tonto came to tell me about the Pleasant Valley War. No  two of them agreed on anything concerning it, except that only one of  the active participants survived the fighting.  Whence comes my title,  TO THE LAST MAN.  Thus I was swamped in a mass of material out of which  I could only flounder to my own conclusion.  Some of the stories told  me are singularly tempting to a novelist.  But, though I believe them  myself, I cannot risk their improbability to those who have no idea of  the wildness of wild men at a wild time.  There really was a terrible  and bloody feud, perhaps the most deadly and least known in all the  annals of the West.  I saw the ground, the cabins, the graves, all so  darkly suggestive of what must have happened.    I never learned the truth of the cause of the Pleasant Valley War, or  if I did hear it I had no means of recognizing it.  All the given  causes were plausible and convincing.  Strange to state, there is still  secrecy and reticence all over the Tonto Basin as to the facts of this  feud.  Many descendents of those killed are living there now. But no  one likes to talk about it.  Assuredly many of the incidents told me  really occurred, as, for example, the terrible one of the two women, in  the face of relentless enemies, saving the bodies of their dead  husbands from being devoured by wild hogs.  Suffice it to say that this  romance is true to my conception of the war, and I base it upon the  setting I learned to know and love so well, upon the strange passions  of primitive people, and upon my instinctive reaction to the facts and  rumors that I gathered.    ZANE GREY.    AVALON, CALIFORNIA,      April, 1921        CHAPTER I    At the end of a dry, uphill ride over barren country Jean Isbel  unpacked to camp at the edge of the cedars where a little rocky canyon  green with willow and cottonwood, promised water and grass.    His animals were tired, especially the pack mule that had carried a  heavy load; and with slow heave of relief they knelt and rolled in the  dust.  Jean experienced something of relief himself as he threw off his  chaps.  He had not been used to hot, dusty, glaring days on the barren  lands.  Stretching his long length beside a tiny rill of clear water  that tinkled over the red stones, he drank thirstily. The water was  cool, but it had an acrid taste--an alkali bite that he did not like.  Not since he had left Oregon had he tasted clear, sweet, cold water;  and he missed it just as he longed for the stately shady forests he had  loved.  This wild, endless Arizona land bade fair to earn his hatred.    By the time he had leisurely completed his tasks twilight had fallen  and coyotes had begun their barking.  Jean listened to the yelps and to  the moan of the cool wind in the cedars with a sense of satisfaction  that these lonely sounds were familiar.  This cedar wood burned into a  pretty fire and the smell of its smoke was newly pleasant.    \"Reckon maybe I'll learn to like Arizona,\" he mused, half aloud. \"But  I've a hankerin' for waterfalls an' dark-green forests. Must be the  Indian in me.... Anyway, dad needs me bad, an' I reckon I'm here for  keeps.\"    Jean threw some cedar branches on the fire, in the light of which he  opened his father's letter, hoping by repeated reading to grasp more of  its strange portent.  It had been two months in reaching him, coming by  traveler, by stage and train, and then by boat, and finally by stage  again.  Written in lead pencil on a leaf torn from an old ledger, it  would have been hard to read even if the writing had been more legible.    \"Dad's writin' was always bad, but I never saw it so shaky,\" said Jean,  thinking aloud.         GRASS VALLY, ARIZONA.       Son Jean,--Come home.  Here is your home and here your needed.     When we left Oregon we all reckoned you would not be long behind.     But its years now.  I am growing old, son, and you was always my     steadiest boy.  Not that you ever was so dam steady.  Only your     wildness seemed more for the woods.  You take after mother, and     your brothers Bill and Guy take after me.  That is the red and     white of it.  Your part Indian, Jean, and that Indian I reckon     I am going to need bad.  I am rich in cattle and horses.  And my     range here is the best I ever seen.  Lately we have been losing     stock.  But that is not all nor so bad.  Sheepmen have moved into     the Tonto and are grazing down on Grass Vally.  Cattlemen and     sheepmen can never bide in this country.  We have bad times ahead.     Reckon I have more reasons to worry and need you, but you must wait     to hear that by word of mouth.  Whatever your doing, chuck it and     rustle for Grass Vally so to make here by spring.
