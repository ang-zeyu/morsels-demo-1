THE TIME TRADERS          CHAPTER 1      To anyone who glanced casually inside the detention room the young man  sitting there did not seem very formidable. In height he might have been  a little above average, but not enough to make him noticeable. His brown  hair was cropped conservatively; his unlined boy's face was not one to  be remembered--unless one was observant enough to note those light-gray  eyes and catch a chilling, measuring expression showing now and then for  an instant in their depths.    Neatly and inconspicuously dressed, in this last quarter of the  twentieth century his like was to be found on any street of the city ten  floors below--to all outward appearances. But that other person under  the protective coloring so assiduously cultivated could touch heights of  encased and controlled fury which Murdock himself did not understand and  was only just learning to use as a weapon against a world he had always  found hostile.    He was aware, though he gave no sign of it, that a guard was watching  him. The cop on duty was an old hand--he probably expected some reaction  other than passive acceptance from the prisoner. But he was not going  to get it. The law had Ross sewed up tight this time. Why didn't they  get about the business of shipping him off? Why had he had that  afternoon session with the skull thumper? Ross had been on the defensive  then, and he had not liked it. He had given to the other's questions all  the attention his shrewd mind could muster, but a faint, very faint,  apprehension still clung to the memory of that meeting.    The door of the detention room opened. Ross did not turn his head, but  the guard cleared his throat as if their hour of mutual silence had  dried his vocal cords. \"On your feet, Murdock! The judge wants to see  you.\"    Ross rose smoothly, with every muscle under fluid control. It never paid  to talk back, to allow any sign of defiance to show. He would go through  the motions as if he were a bad little boy who had realized his errors.  It was a meek-and-mild act that had paid off more than once in Ross's  checkered past. So he faced the man seated behind the desk in the other  room with an uncertain, diffident smile, standing with boyish  awkwardness, respectfully waiting for the other to speak first.    Judge Ord Rawle. It was his rotten luck to pull old Eagle Beak on his  case. Well, he would simply have to take it when the old boy dished it  out. Not that he had to remain stuck with it later....    \"You have a bad record, young man.\"    Ross allowed his smile to fade; his shoulders slumped. But under  concealing lids his eyes showed an instant of cold defiance.    \"Yes, sir,\" he agreed in a voice carefully cultivated to shake  convincingly about the edges. Then suddenly all Ross's pleasure in the  skill of his act was wiped away. Judge Rawle was not alone; that blasted  skull thumper was sitting there, watching the prisoner with the same  keenness he had shown the other day.    \"A very bad record for the few years you have had to make it.\" Eagle  Beak was staring at him, too, but without the same look of penetration,  luckily for Ross. \"By rights, you should be turned over to the new  Rehabilitation Service....\"    Ross froze inside. That was the \"treatment,\" icy rumors of which had  spread throughout his particular world. For the second time since he had  entered the room his self-confidence was jarred. Then he clung with a  degree of hope to the phrasing of that last sentence.    \"Instead, I have been authorized to offer you a choice, Murdock. One  which I shall state--and on record--I do not in the least approve.\"    Ross's twinge of fear faded. If the judge didn't like it, there must be  something in it to the advantage of Ross Murdock. He'd grab it for sure!    \"There is a government project in need of volunteers. It seems that you  have tested out as possible material for this assignment. If you sign  for it, the law will consider the time spent on it as part of your  sentence. Thus you may aid the country which you have heretofore  disgraced----\"    \"And if I refuse, I go to this rehabilitation. Is that right, sir?\"    \"I certainly consider you a fit candidate for rehabilitation. Your  record--\" He shuffled through the papers on his desk.    \"I choose to volunteer for the project, sir.\"    The judge snorted and pushed all the papers into a folder. He spoke to a  man waiting in the shadows. \"Here then is your volunteer, Major.\"    Ross bottled in his relief. He was over the first hump. And since his  luck had held so far, he might be about to win all the way....    The man Judge Rawle called \"Major\" moved into the light. At the first  glance Ross, to his hidden annoyance, found himself uneasy. To face up  to Eagle Beak was all part of the game. But somehow he sensed one did  not play such games with this man.    \"Thank you, your honor. We will be on our way at once. This weather is  not very promising.\"    Before he realized what was happening, Ross found himself walking meekly  to the door. He considered trying to give the major the slip when they  left the building, losing himself in a storm-darkened city. But they did  not take the elevator downstairs. Instead, they climbed two or three  flights up the emergency stairs. And to his humiliation Ross found  himself panting and slowing, while the other man, who must have been a  good dozen years his senior, showed no signs of discomfort.    They came out into the snow on the roof, and the major flashed a torch  skyward, guiding in a dark shadow which touched down before them. A  helicopter! For the first time Ross began to doubt the wisdom of his  choice.    \"On your way, Murdock!\" The voice was impersonal enough, but that very  impersonality got under one's skin.    Bundled into the machine between the silent major and an equally quiet  pilot in uniform, Ross was lifted over the city, whose ways he knew as  well as he knew the lines on his own palm, into the unknown he was  already beginning to regard dubiously. The lighted streets and  buildings, their outlines softened by the soft wet snow, fell out of  sight. Now they could mark the outer highways. Ross refused to ask any  questions. He could take this silent treatment; he _had_ taken a lot of  tougher things in the past.    The patches of light disappeared, and the country opened out. The plane  banked. Ross, with all the familiar landmarks of his world gone, could  not have said if they were headed north or south. But moments later not  even the thick curtain of snowflakes could blot out the pattern of red  lights on the ground, and the helicopter settled down.    \"Come on!\"    For the second time Ross obeyed. He stood shivering, engulfed in a  miniature blizzard. His clothing, protection enough in the city, did  little good against the push of the wind. A hand gripped his upper arm,  and he was drawn forward to a low building. A door banged and Ross and  his companion came into a region of light and very welcome heat.    \"Sit down--over there!\"    Too bewildered to resent orders, Ross sat. There were other men in the  room. One, wearing a queer suit of padded clothing, a bulbous headgear  hooked over his arm, was reading a paper. The major crossed to speak to  him and after they conferred for a moment, the major beckoned Ross with  a crooked finger. Ross trailed the officer into an inner room lined with  lockers.    From one of the lockers the major pulled a suit like the pilot's, and  began to measure it against Ross. \"All right,\" he snapped. \"Climb into  this! We haven't all night.\"    Ross climbed into the suit. As soon as he fastened the last zipper his  companion jammed one of the domed helmets on his head. The pilot looked  in the door. \"We'd better scramble, Kelgarries, or we may be grounded  for the duration!\"    They hurried back to the flying field. If the helicopter had been a  surprising mode of travel, this new machine was something straight out  of the future--a needle-slim ship poised on fins, its sharp nose lifting  vertically into the heavens. There was a scaffolding along one side,  which the pilot scaled to enter the ship.    Unwillingly, Ross climbed the same ladder and found that he must wedge  himself in on his back, his knees hunched up almost under his chin. To  make it worse, cramped as those quarters were, he had to share them with  the major. A transparent hood snapped down and was secured, sealing them  in.    During his short lifetime Ross had often been afraid, bitterly afraid.  He had fought to toughen his mind and body against such fears. But what  he experienced now was no ordinary fear; it was panic so strong that it  made him feel sick. To be shut in this small place with the knowledge  that he had no control over his immediate future brought him face to  face with every terror he had ever known, all of them combined into one  horrible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's note:  Transliteration of Greek words appears between + signs.]                  Library Edition    THE COMPLETE WORKS OF JOHN RUSKIN             CROWN OF WILD OLIVE             TIME AND TIDE            QUEEN OF THE AIR      LECTURES ON ART AND LANDSCAPE             ARATRA PENTELICI           NATIONAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION            NEW YORK CHICAGO                   ***              LECTURES ON ART.

COLOUR                              123          PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1887.      The following lectures were the most important piece of my literary work  done with unabated power, best motive, and happiest concurrence of  circumstance. They were written and delivered while my mother yet lived,  and had vividest sympathy in all I was attempting;--while also my  friends put unbroken trust in me, and the course of study I had followed  seemed to fit me for the acceptance of noble tasks and graver  responsibilities than those only of a curious traveler, or casual  teacher.    Men of the present world may smile at the sanguine utterances of the  first four lectures: but it has not been wholly my own fault that they  have remained unfulfilled; nor do I retract one word of hope for the  success of other masters, nor a single promise made to the sincerity of  the student's labor, on the lines here indicated. It would have been  necessary to my success, that I should have accepted permanent residence  in Oxford, and scattered none of my energy in other tasks. But I chose  to spend half my time at Coniston Waterhead; and to use half my force in  attempts to form a new social organization,--the St. George's  Guild,--which made all my Oxford colleagues distrustful of me, and many  of my Oxford hearers contemptuous. My mother's death in 1871, and that  of a dear friend in 1875, took away the personal joy I had in anything I  wrote or designed: and in 1876, feeling unable for Oxford duty, I  obtained a year's leave of rest, and, by the kind and wise counsel of  Prince Leopold, went to Venice, to reconsider the form into which I had  cast her history in the abstract of it given in the \"Stones of Venice.\"    The more true and close view of that history, begun in \"St. Mark's  Rest,\" and the fresh architectural drawings made under the stimulus of  it, led me forward into new fields of thought, inconsistent with the  daily attendance needed by my Oxford classes; and in my discontent with  the state I saw them in, and my inability to return to their guidance  without abandonment of all my designs of Venetian and Italian history,  began the series of vexations which ended in the very nearly mortal  illness of 1878.    Since, therefore, the period of my effective action in Oxford was only  from 1870 to 1875, it can scarcely be matter of surprise or reproof that  I could not in that time obtain general trust in a system of teaching  which, though founded on that of Da Vinci and Reynolds, was at variance  with the practice of all recent European academy schools; nor  establish--on the unassisted resources of the Slade Professorship--the  schools of Sculpture, Architecture, Metal-work, and manuscript  Illumination, of which the design is confidently traced in the four  inaugural lectures.    In revising the book, I have indicated as in the last edition of the  \"Seven Lamps,\" passages which the student will find generally  applicable, and in all their bearings useful, as distinguished from  those regarding only their immediate subject. The relative importance of  these broader statements, I again indicate by the use of capitals or  italics; and if the reader will index the sentences he finds useful for  his own work, in the blank pages left for that purpose at the close of  the volume, he will certainly get more good of them than if they had  been grouped for him according to the author's notion of their contents.    SANDGATE, _10th January, 1888_.          LECTURES ON ART          LECTURE I    INAUGURAL      1. The duty which is to-day laid on me, of introducing, among the  elements of education appointed in this great University, one not only  new, but such as to involve in its possible results some modification of  the rest, is, as you well feel, so grave, that no man could undertake it  without laying himself open to the imputation of a kind of insolence;  and no man could undertake it rightly, without being in danger of having  his hands shortened by dread of his task, and mistrust of himself.    And it has chanced to me, of late, to be so little acquainted either  with pride or hope, that I can scarcely recover so much as I now need,  of the one for strength, and of the other for foresight, except by  remembering that noble persons, and friends of the high temper that  judges most clearly where it loves best, have desired that this trust  should be given me: and by resting also in the conviction that the  goodly tree whose roots, by God's help, we set in earth to-day, will not  fail of its height because the planting of it is under poor auspices, or  the first shoots of it enfeebled by ill gardening.      2. The munificence of the English gentleman to whom we owe the founding  of this Professorship at once in our three great Universities, has  accomplished the first great group of a series of changes now taking  gradual effect in our system of public education, which, as you well  know, are the sign of a vital change in the national mind, respecting  both the principles on which that education should be conducted, and the  ranks of society to which it should extend. For, whereas it was formerly  thought that the discipline necessary to form the character of youth was  best given in the study of abstract branches of literature and  philosophy, it is now thought that the same, or a better, discipline may  be given by informing men in early years of the things it will be of  chief practical advantage to them afterwards to know; and by permitting  to them the choice of any field of study which they may feel to be best  adapted to their personal dispositions. I have always used what poor  influence I possessed in advancing this change; nor can any one rejoice  more than I in its practical results. But the completion--I will not  venture to say, correction--of a system established by the highest  wisdom of noble ancestors, cannot be too reverently undertaken: and it  is necessary for the English people, who are sometimes violent in change  in proportion to the reluctance with which they admit its necessity, to  be now, oftener than at other times, reminded that the object of  instruction here is not primarily attainment, but discipline; and that a  youth is sent to our Universities, not (hitherto at least) to be  apprenticed to a trade, nor even always to be advanced in a profession;  but, always, to be made a gentleman and a scholar.      3. To be made these,--if there is in him the making of either. The  populaces of civilised countries have lately been under a feverish  impression that it is possible for all men to be both; and that having  once become, by passing through certain mechanical processes of  instruction, gentle and learned, they are sure to attain in the sequel  the consummate beatitude of being rich.    Rich, in the way and measure in which it is well for them to be so, they  may, without doubt, _all_ become. There is indeed a land of Havilah open  to them, of which the wonderful sentence is literally true--\"The gold of  _that_ land is good.\" But they must first understand, that education, in  its deepest sense, is not the equaliser, but the discerner, of men;[1]  and that, so far from being instruments for the collection of riches,  the first lesson of wisdom is to disdain them, and of gentleness, to  diffuse.    [Footnote 1: The full meaning of this sentence, and of that which closes  the paragraph, can only be understood by reference to my more developed  statements on the subject of Education in \"Modern Painters\" and in \"Time  and Tide.\" The following fourth paragraph is the most pregnant summary  of my political and social principles I have ever been able to give.]    It is not therefore, as far as we can judge, yet possible for all men to  be gentlemen and scholars. Even under the best training some will remain  too selfish to refuse wealth, and some too dull to desire leisure. But  many more might be so than are now; nay, perhaps all men in England  might one day be so, if England truly desired her supremacy among the  nations to be in kindness and in learning. To which good end, it will  indeed contribute that we add some practice of the lower arts to our  scheme of University education; but the thing which is vitally necessary  is, that we should extend the spirit of University education to the  practice of the lower arts.      4. And, above all, it is needful that we do this by redeeming them from  their present pain of self-contempt, and by giving them _rest_. It has  been too long boasted as the pride of England, that out of a vast  multitude of men, confessed to be in evil case, it was possible for  individuals, by strenuous effort, and rare good fortune, occasionally to  emerge into the light, and look back with self-gratulatory scorn upon  the occupations of their parents, and the circumstances of their  infancy. Ought we not rather to aim at an ideal of national life,"]]]
