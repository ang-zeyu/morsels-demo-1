The dawn of the Sun of Reality is assuredly for the illumination of the  world and for the manifestation of mercy. In the assemblage of the family  of Adam results and fruits are praiseworthy, and the holy bestowals of  every bounty are abundant. It is an absolute mercy and a complete bounty,  the illumination of the world, fellowship and harmony, love and union;  nay, rather, mercifulness and oneness, the elimination of discord and the  unity of whosoever are on the earth in the utmost of freedom and dignity.  The Blessed Beauty said: \"All are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of  one branch.\" He likened the world of existence to one tree and all the  souls to leaves, blossoms and fruits. Therefore all the branches, leaves,  blossoms and fruits must be in the utmost of freshness, and the bringing  about of this delicacy and sweetness depends upon union and fellowship.  Therefore they must assist each other with all their power and seek  everlasting life. Thus the friends of God must manifest the mercy of the  Compassionate Lord in the world of existence and must show forth the  bounty of the visible and invisible King. They must purify their sight,  and look upon mankind as the leaves, blossoms and fruits of the tree of  creation, and must always be thinking of doing good to someone, of love,  consideration, affection and assistance to somebody. They must see no  enemy and count no one as an ill wisher. They must consider every one on  the earth as a friend; regard the stranger as an intimate, and the alien  as a companion. They must not be bound by any tie, nay, rather, they  should be free from every bond. In this day the one who is favored in the  threshold of grandeur is the one who offers the cup of faithfulness and  bestows the pearl of gift to the enemies, even to the fallen oppressor,  lends a helping hand, and considers every bitter foe as an affectionate  friend.    These are the commands of the Blessed Beauty, these are the counsels of  the Greatest Name. O ye dear friends! The world is engaged in war and  struggle, and mankind is in the utmost conflict and danger. The darkness  of unfaithfulness has enshrouded the earth and the illumination of  faithfulness has become concealed. All nations and tribes of the world  have sharpened their claws and are warring and fighting with each other.  The edifice of man is shattered. Thousands of families are wandering  disconsolate. Thousands of souls are besmeared with dust and blood in the  arena of battle and struggle every year, and the tent of happiness and  life is overthrown. The prominent men become commanders and boast of  bloodshed, and glory in destruction. One says: \"I have severed with my  sword the necks of a nation,\" and one: \"I have levelled a kingdom to the  dust\"; and another: \"I have overthrown the foundation of a government.\"  This is the pivot around which the pride and glory of mankind are  revolving. In all regions friendship and uprightness are denounced and  reconciliation and regard for truth are despised. The herald of peace,  reformation, love and reconciliation is the Religion of the Blessed Beauty  which has pitched its tent on the apex of the world and proclaimed its  summons to the people.    Then, O ye friends of God! Appreciate the value of this precious  Revelation, move and act in accordance with it and walk in the straight  path and the right way. Show it to the people. Raise the melody of the  Kingdom and spread abroad the teachings and ordinances of the loving Lord  so that the world may become another world, the darkened earth may become  illumined and the dead body of the people may obtain new life. Every soul  may seek everlasting life through the breath of the Merciful. Life in this  mortal world will quickly come to an end, and this earthly glory, wealth,  comfort and happiness will soon vanish and be no more. Summon ye the  people to God and call the souls to the manners and conduct of the Supreme  Concourse. To the orphans be ye kind fathers, and to the unfortunate a  refuge and shelter. To the poor be a treasure of wealth, and to the sick a  remedy and healing. Be a helper of every oppressed one, the protector of  every destitute one, be ye ever mindful to serve any soul of mankind.  Attach no importance to self-seeking, rejection, arrogance, oppression and  enmity. Heed them not. Deal in the contrary way. Be kind in truth, not  only in appearance and outwardly. Every soul of the friends of God must  concentrate his mind on this, that he may manifest the mercy of God and  the bounty of the Forgiving One. He must do good to every soul whom he  encounters, and render benefit to him, becoming the cause of improving the  morals and correcting the thoughts so that the light of guidance may shine  forth and the bounty of His Holiness the Merciful "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19240"],[0,"Bahá'í Prayers (#1)"],[1,"Baha'i Prayers: A Selection of Prayers Revealed by Baha'u'llah, the Bab,  and 'Abdu'l-Baha      by Baha'u'llah, The Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha          Edition 1, (September 2006)                                       BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.
