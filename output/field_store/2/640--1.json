COWPER WITH DRAWINGS BY R. CALDECOTT]          John Gilpin was a citizen          Of credit and renown,      A train-band captain eke was he,          Of famous London town.        John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,          \"Though wedded we have been      These twice ten tedious years, yet we          No holiday have seen.        \"To-morrow is our wedding-day,          And we will then repair      Unto the 'Bell' at Edmonton,          All in a chaise and pair.        \"My sister, and my sister's child,          Myself, and children three,      Will fill the chaise; so you must ride          On horseback after we.\"            [Illustration: The Linendraper bold]        He soon replied, \"I do admire          Of womankind but one,      And you are she, my dearest dear,          Therefore it shall be done.        \"I am a linendraper bold,          As all the world doth know,      And my good friend the calender          Will lend his horse to go.\"            [Illustration]        Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, \"That's well said;          And for that wine is dear,      We will be furnished with our own,          Which is both bright and clear.\"        John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;          O'erjoyed was he to find,      That though on pleasure she was bent,          She had a frugal mind.            [Illustration]        The morning came, the chaise was brought,          But yet was not allowed      To drive up to the door, lest all          Should say that she was proud.        So three doors off the chaise was stayed,          Where they did all get in;      Six precious souls, and all agog          To dash through thick and thin.        Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,          Were never folks so glad!      The stones did rattle underneath,          As if Cheapside were mad.        John Gilpin at his horse's side          Seized fast the flowing mane,      And up he got, in haste to ride,          But soon came down again;            [Illustration: The 3 Customers]        For saddletree scarce reached had he,          His journey to begin,      When, turning round his head, he saw          Three customers come in.        So down he came; for loss of time,          Although it grieved him sore,      Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,          Would trouble him much more.            [Illustration]        'Twas long before the customers          Were suited to their mind,      When Betty screaming came downstairs,          \"The wine is left behind!\"        \"Good lack!\" quoth he, \"yet bring it me,          My leathern belt likewise,      In which I bear my trusty sword          When I do exercise.\"        Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)          Had two stone bottles found,      To hold the liquor that she loved,          And keep it safe and sound.        Each bottle had a curling ear,          Through which the belt he drew      And hung a bottle on each side,          To make his balance true.            [Illustration]        Then over all, that he might be          Equipped from top to toe,      His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,          He manfully did throw.        Now see him mounted once again          Upon his nimble steed,      Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,          With caution and good heed.        But finding soon a smoother road          Beneath his well-shod feet,      The snorting beast began to trot,          Which galled him in his seat.            [Illustration]        \"So, fair and softly!\" John he cried,          But John he cried in vain;      That trot became a gallop soon,          In spite of curb and rein.        So stooping down, as needs he must          Who cannot sit upright,      He grasped the mane with both his hands,          And eke with all his might.        His horse, who never in that sort          Had handled been before,      What thing upon his back had got,          Did wonder more and more.        Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;          Away went hat and wig;      He little dreamt, when he set out,          Of running such a rig.        The wind did blow, the cloak did fly          Like streamer long and gay,      Till, loop and button failing both,          At last it flew away.            [Illustration]        Then might all people well discern          The bottles he had slung;      A bottle swinging at each side,          As hath been said or sung.        The dogs did bark, the children screamed,          Up flew the windows all;      And every soul cried out, \"Well done!\"          As loud as he could bawl.            [Illustration]        Away went Gilpin--who but he?          His fame soon spread around;      \"He carries weight! he rides a race!          'Tis for a thousand pound!\"            [Illustration]        And still as fast as he drew near,          'Twas wonderful to view      How in a trice the turnpike-men          Their gates wide open threw.            [Illustration]        And now, as he went bowing down          His reeking head full low,      The bottles twain behind his back          Were shattered at a blow.        Down ran the wine into the road,          Most piteous to be seen,      Which made the horse's flanks to smoke,          As they had basted been.            [Illustration]        But still he seemed to carry weight,          With leathern girdle braced;      For all might see the bottle-necks          Still dangling at his waist.            [Illustration]        Thus all through merry Islington          These gambols he did play,      Until he came unto the Wash          Of Edmonton so gay;        And there he threw the wash about          On both sides of the way,      Just like unto a trundling mop,          Or a wild goose at play.            [Illustration]        At Edmonton his loving wife          From the balcony spied      Her tender husband, wondering much          To see how he did ride.        \"Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house!\"          They all at once did cry;      \"The dinner waits, and we are tired;\"          Said Gilpin--\"So am I!\"            [Illustration]        But yet his horse was not a whit          Inclined to tarry there;      For why?--his owner had a house          Full ten miles off, at Ware.        So like an arrow swift he flew,          Shot by an archer strong;      So did he fly--which brings me to          The middle of my song.            [Illustration]        Away went Gilpin, out of breath,          And sore against his will,      Till at his friend the calender's          His horse at last stood still.        The calender, amazed to see          His neighbour in such trim,      Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,          And thus accosted him:            [Illustration]        \"What news? what news? your tidings tell;          Tell me you must and shall--      Say why bareheaded you are come,          Or why you come at all?\"        Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,          And loved a timely joke;      And thus unto the calender          In merry guise he spoke:        \"I came because your horse would come:          And, if I well forebode,      My hat and wig will soon be here,          They are upon the road.\"        The calender, right glad to find          His friend in merry pin,      Returned him not a single word,          But to the house went in;            [Illustration]        Whence straight he came with hat and wig,          A wig that flowed behind,      A hat not much the worse for wear,          Each comely in its kind.        He held them up, and in his turn          Thus showed his ready wit:      \"My head is twice as big as yours,          They therefore needs must fit.\"            [Illustration]        \"But let me scrape the dirt away,          That hangs upon your face;      And stop and eat, for well you may          Be in a hungry case.\"        Said John, \"It is my wedding-day,          And all the world would stare      If wife should dine at Edmonton,          And I should dine at Ware.\"        So turning to his horse, he said          \"I am in haste to dine;      'Twas for your pleasure you came here,          You shall go back for mine.\"        Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast          For which he paid full dear;      For while he spake, a braying ass          Did sing most loud and clear;        Whereat his horse did snort, as he          Had heard a lion roar,      And galloped off with all his might,          As he had done before.            [Illustration]        Away went Gilpin, and away          Went Gilpin's hat and wig;      He lost them sooner than at first,          For why?--they were too big.            [Illustration]        Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw          Her husband posting down      Into the country far away,          She pulled out half-a-crown;        And thus unto the youth she said          That drove them to the \"Bell,\"      \"This shall be yours when you bring back          My husband safe and well.\"            [Illustration]        The youth did ride, and soon did meet          John coming back amain;      Whom in a trice he tried to stop,          By catching at his rein.        But not performing what he meant,          And gladly would have done,      The frighted steed he frighted more,   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20778"],[0,"Sylva; Or, A Discourse of Forest Trees.

I    _Evelyn & his literary contemporaries Isaac Walton & Samuel Pepys._    Among the prose writers of the second half of the seventeenth century  John Evelyn holds a very distinguished position. The age of the  Restoration and the Revolution is indeed rich in many names that have  won for themselves an enduring place in the history of English  literature. South, Tillotson, and Barrow among theologians, Newton in  mathematical science, Locke and Bentley in philosophy and classical  learning, Clarendon and Burnet in history, L'Estrange, Butler, Marvell  and Dryden in miscellaneous prose, and Temple as an essayist, have all  made their mark by prose writings which will endure for all time. But  the names which stand out most prominently in popular estimation as  authors of great masterpieces in the prose of this period are certainly  those of John Bunyan, John Evelyn, and Izaak Walton. And along with them  Samuel Pepys is also well entitled to be ranked as a great contemporary  writer, though he was at pains to try and ensure his being permitted to  remain free from the publicity of authorship, for such time at least as  the curious might allow his Diary to remain hidden in the cipher he  employed.    With the great though untrained genius of Bunyan none of these other  three celebrated prose authors of this time has anything in common. He  stands apart from them in his fervently religious and romantic  temperament, in his richness of representation and ingenuity of  analogy, and in his forcible quaintness of style, as completely as he  did in social status and in personal surroundings. In complete contrast  to the romantic productions of the self-educated tinker of Bedford, the  works of Walton and Evelyn were at any rate influenced by, though they  can hardly be said to have been moulded upon, the style of the preceding  age of old English prose writers ending with Milton. The influence of  the latter is, indeed, plainly noticeable both in the diction and in the  general sentiment of these two great masters of the pure, nervous  English of their period.    It would serve no good purpose to make any attempt here to trace the  points of resemblance between the works of Walton and Evelyn, and then  to note their differences in style. Each has contributed a masterpiece  towards our national literature, and it would be a mere waste of time to  make comparisons between their chief productions. This much, however,  may be remarked, that the conditions under which each worked were  completely different from those surrounding the other. Izaak Walton, the  author of many singularly interesting biographies, and of the quaint  half-poetical _Compleat Angler or the Contemplative Man's Recreation_,  the great classic \"Discourse of Fish and Fishing,\" was a London  tradesman, while his equally celebrated contemporary John Evelyn, author  of _Sylva, or a Discourse of Forest Trees_, the classic of British  Forestry, was a more highly cultured man, who wrote, in the leisure of  official duties and amid the surroundings of easy refinement, many  useful and tasteful works both in prose and poetry, ranging over a wide  variety of subjects. Judging from the number of editions which appeared  of their principal works, they were both held in great favour by the  reading public, though on the whole the advantage in some respects lay  with Evelyn.
