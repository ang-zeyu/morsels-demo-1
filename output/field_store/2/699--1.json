BY MRS. R. LEE,    FORMERLY MRS. T. E. BOWDICH,  AUTHOR OF \"THE AFRICAN WANDERERS,\" \"ADVENTURES IN AUSTRALIA,\"  \"MEMOIRS OF CUVIER,\" ETC.    WITH    ILLUSTRATIONS BY HARRISON WEIR.    LONDON:  GRANT AND GRIFFITH,  SUCCESSORS TO J. HARRIS,  CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.    M.DCCC.LII.    LONDON:  PRINTED BY J. WERTHEIMER AND CO.,  CIRCUS PLACE, FINSBURY.          PREFACE.      In making a selection of anecdotes, those have been assembled which were  supplied by me to other works, and in most instances have received  considerable amplification; others have been given which never before  were printed--perhaps not even written; while all which have been  transferred from other pages to mine have received the stamp of  authenticity. Besides those whose names are already mentioned, I have to  thank several friends who have drawn from their private stores for my  advantage, and thus enabled me to offer much that is perfectly new.           *       *       *       *       *    Dry details of science and classification have been laid aside, but a  certain order has been kept to avoid confusion; and, although endeavours  have been made to throw as much interest as possible over these  recorded habits and actions of the brute creation; I love the latter too  well to raise a doubt by one word of embellishment, even if I did not  abstain from principle.           *       *       *       *       *    The intentions with which this work was commenced have not been carried  out, inasmuch as materials have crowded upon me beyond all calculation;  and, although a large portion has been rejected, the anecdotes related  go no farther than the Mammalia, while almost all animals were to have  been included.           *       *       *       *       *    With regard to the remaining orders--if the present work should meet  with a favourable reception, I shall hope next year to present the  public with touching and amusing proofs of the sagacity and dispositions  of birds, and of \"hair-breadth scapes\" from reptiles, etc., some of  which will, like those in the present volume, be carefully selected from  the works of travellers, from the resources of friends, and from my own  experience.           *       *       *       *       *    To the pleasing task of enlightening those, who, shut up in close  cities, have no opportunity of observing for themselves, and to the  still higher enjoyment of directing young minds to an elevating pursuit,  the naturalist adds a gratification even better than all, by making  known the hidden wonders of nature; and leaving to those who delight in  argument, the ever unsolved question of where instinct ends and reason  begins, he sets forth the love of the great Creator towards all His  creatures, and the ways He takes to show His wisdom.

THE QUADRUMANA, OR MONKEY TRIBE.      Formed like man, and practicing similar gestures, but with thumbs  instead of great toes upon their feet, and with so narrow a heel-bone,  that even those who constantly walk upright have not the firm and  dignified step of human beings; the Quadrumana yet approximate so  closely to us, that they demand the first place in a book devoted  principally to the intellectual (whether it be reason or instinct)  history of animals. This approximation is a matter of amusement to some;  but to the larger portion of mankind, I should say, it is a source of  disgust. \"Rapoynda,\" I exclaimed, one day, to a troublesome,  inquisitive, restless negro, pointing to a black monkey, which much  resembled him in character, \"that is your brother.\" Never shall I forget  the malignant scowl which passed over the man's features at my heedless  comparison. No apology, no kindness, not even the gift of a smart  waistcoat, which he greatly coveted, ever restored me to his good  graces; and I was not sorry when his Chief summoned him from my  vicinity, for I dreaded his revenge.    A few years after, I stood lost in admiration before Sir Edwin  Landseer's inimitable picture of \"the monkey who had seen the world,\" in  which nature and truth lend their tone and force to the highest efforts  of art; when a voice exclaimed, \"How can you waste your time looking at  that thing; such creatures ought never to have been painted;\" and  although the speaker was a religious man, he muttered to himself, \"I am  not sure they ought ever to have been made.\" The voice proceeded from  one of the finest instances of manly beauty; one famed also for talent  and acquirement. Rapoynda started into my recollection; and as I slowly  left the talented picture, I could not help smiling at the common  feeling between the savage and the gentleman, thereby proving its  universality.    Never did any one start for a tropical climate with a greater antipathy  towards these \"wild men\" than I did; I lived years in their vicinity and  yet contrived to avoid all contact with them, and it was not till I was  homeward-bound that my conversion was effected. The ship in which Mr.  Bowdich and myself took a round-about course to England, was floating  on a wide expanse of water, disturbed only by the heavy swell, which  forms the sole motion in a calm; the watch on deck were seated near the  bows of the vessel, the passengers and officers were almost all below,  there was only myself and the helmsman on the after-deck; he stood  listlessly by the binnacle, and I was wholly occupied in reading. A  noise between a squeak and a chatter suddenly met my ears; and before I  could turn my head to see whence it proceeded, a heavy, living creature  jumped on to my shoulders from behind, and its tail encircled my throat.  I felt it was Jack, the cook's monkey; the mischievous, malicious,  mocking, but inimitable Jack, whose pranks had often made me laugh  against my will, as I watched him from a distance, but with whom I had  never made the least acquaintance. Whether from fear or presence of mind  I do not pretend to say, but I remained perfectly still, and in a minute  or two Jack put his head forward and stared me in the face, uttering a  sort of croak; he then descended on to my knees, examined my hands as if  he were counting my fingers, tried to take off my rings, and when I gave  him some biscuit, curled himself compactly into my lap. We were friends  from that moment. My aversion thus cured, I have ever since felt  indescribable interest and entertainment in watching, studying, and  protecting monkeys. We had several on board the above-mentioned vessel,  but Jack was the prince of them all.    Exclusively belonging to the cook, although a favourite with the whole  crew, my friend (a Cercopithecus from Senegal) had been at first kept by  means of a cord, attached to the caboose; but, as he became more and  more tame, his liberty was extended, till at last he was allowed the  whole range of the ship, with the exception of the captain's and  passengers' cabins. The occupations which he marked out for himself  began at early dawn, by overturning the steward's parrot-cage whenever  he could get at it, in order to secure the lump of sugar which then  rolled out, or lick up the water which ran from the upset cup; he  evidently intended to pull the parrot's feathers, but the latter, by  turning round as fast as Jack turned, always faced him, and his beak was  too formidable to be encountered. I was frequently awakened by the quick  trampling of feet at this early hour, and knew it arose from a pursuit  of Jack, in consequence of some mischief on his part.

PREFACE.      MY DEAR LADS,    The story of the Nile Expedition is so recent that no word of  introduction is necessary to the historical portion of the tale. The  moral, such as it is, of the story of the two lads brought up as  brothers is--Never act in haste, for repentance is sure to follow. In  this case great anxiety and unhappiness were caused through a lad acting  as he believed for the best, but without consulting those who had every  right to a voice in the matter. That all came right in the end in no way  affects this excellent rule, for all might have gone wrong. We are often  misled by a generous impulse, more often perhaps than by an evil one,  but the consequences may be just as serious in the one case as the  other. When in trouble you should always go freely to your best friends  and natural advisers, and lay the case fully before them. It may be  that, if the trouble has arisen from your own fault, you will have to  bear their temporary displeasure, but this is a small thing in  comparison with the permanent injury that may arise from acting on your  own impulse. In most cases, cowardice lies at the bottom of concealment,  and cowardice is of all vices the most contemptible; while the fear of  the displeasure of a parent has ruined many a boy's life. Therefore,  when you are in serious trouble always go to your best friend, your  father, and lay the case frankly and honestly before him; for you may  be sure that present displeasure and even punishment are but small  things in comparison with the trouble that may arise from trying to get  out of the difficulty in other ways.    Yours sincerely,    G. A. HENTY          CONTENTS.      CHAP.                                     Page         I.  MIXED!                             11        II.

CHAPTER I    MIXED!      In a room in the married non-commissioned officers' quarters in the  cantonments at Agra, a young woman was sitting looking thoughtfully at  two infants, who lay sleeping together on the outside of a bed with a  shawl thrown lightly over them. Jane Humphreys had been married about a  year. She was the daughter of the regimental sergeant-major, and had  been a spoilt child. She was good looking, and had, so the wives and  daughters of the other non-commissioned officers said, laid herself out  to catch one of the young officers of the regiment, and was bitterly  disappointed at the failure of her efforts.    The report may have been untrue, for Jane Farran was by no means popular  with the other women, taking far too much upon herself, as they  considered, upon the strength of her father's rank, and giving herself  airs as if she were better than those around her. There were girls in  the regiment just as good looking as she was without any of her airs and  tempers. Why should she set herself up above the rest?    When, however, Sergeant-major Farran died suddenly of sunstroke after a  heavy field-day, whatever plans and hopes his daughter may have  entertained came to an end. Her name and that of her mother were put  down among the women to be sent, with the next batch of invalids, home  to England, and she suddenly accepted the offer of marriage of young  Sergeant Humphreys, whose advances she had previously treated with  scorn. They were married six weeks later, on the day before her mother  was to go down by train with a party of invalids to Calcutta. The  universal opinion of the women in the regiment was that the sergeant had  got a bad bargain.    \"No man of spirit,\" one of them said, \"would have taken up with a girl  who only accepted him because she could not do any better. She has got  her temper written in her face, and a nice time of it he is likely to  have.\"    It may have been true that Jane Humphreys had during her father's  lifetime had her ambitions, but she was a clever woman and adapted  herself to her circumstances. If, as the sergeant-major's daughter, she  had given herself airs, and had thrown herself in the way of the young  officers, and had been light and flighty in her manner, all this was  changed as soon as she was married, and even the most censorious were  obliged to admit that she made Sergeant Humphreys a better wife than  they had expected. His home was admirably kept, the gay dresses that had  been somewhat beyond her station were cut up and altered, and she  dressed neatly and quietly.    She was handy with her fingers, her things always fitted her well, and  she gained the approbation of the officers' wives, who had previously  looked upon her with some disfavour as a forward young person. She made  every effort to get on good terms with the wives of the other  non-commissioned officers, and succeeded at last in overcoming the  prejudice which, as Jane Farran, she had excited. There was no doubt  that she was a clever woman, and it was equally beyond doubt that she  completely managed her husband. She was much his superior in education,  and possessing far greater abilities could twist him round her little  finger, although she did it so cleverly that he never suspected that he  was the victim of such an operation.    A month previous to the opening of the story she had been confined of a  boy, and two days later Mrs. Clinton, the wife of the captain of her  husband's company, also became a mother. Before the week was over Mrs.  Clinton was taken dangerously ill, and as it was impossible for her to  nurse her child, the surgeon of the regiment recommended that it should  be given into the"]]]
