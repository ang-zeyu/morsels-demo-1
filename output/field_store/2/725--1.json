With Illustrations in Color by Walter Crane                Thomas Nelson and Sons  New York, Edinburgh, London  Toronto, And Paris          In tholde dayes of the King Arthour,    Of which that Britons speken great honour,    All was this land fulfilled of faery.                           _The Canterbury Tales._        Printed in the United States of America          PREFACE      This book is an attempt to tell some of the stories of King Arthur and  his Knights in a way which will be interesting to every boy and girl  who loves adventures.    Although tales of these old British heroes have been published before  in a form intended for young people, it is believed that they have  never been related quite in the same spirit nor from the same point of  view; and it is hoped that the book will fill a place hitherto vacant  in the hearts of all boys and girls.    No doubt many of you, my young readers, have at some time or another  taken down the _Morte D'Arthur_ from your father's bookshelves and read  a few pages of it here and there. But I doubt if any of you have ever  gone very far in the volume. You found generally, I think, that it was  written in a puzzling, old-fashioned language, that though it spoke of  many interesting things, and seemed that it ought to be well worth  reading, yet somehow it was tedious and dry.    In the tales as I have retold them for you, I hope you will not find  any of these faults. Besides writing them in simple language, I have  chosen only those episodes which I know would appeal to you. I have  added or altered here and there, for in places it struck me that there  was just wanting a word or two to make you feel the magic that was  everywhere abroad in those days. It seemed to me that some mysterious  adventure might easily be waiting in the ruined and deserted Roman town  on the desolate moor, or even just round the mossy trunk of the next  oak in the forest-drive, through which the knight was riding; or that  any fair lady or questing dog which he might meet could turn out to be  a wizard seeking to work woe upon him. Nevertheless, I was always sure  that in those bright days when the world was young, whatever evil power  might get the mastery for a little while, the knight's courage,  humility, and faith would win through every peril at the end.    In this book, besides reading of wonderful adventures and brave  fighting, you will learn just what sort of man a perfect knight was  required to be in the chivalrous times when men wore armour and rode on  errantry. The duties of a 'good and faithful knight' were quite simple,  but they were often very hard to perform. They were--to protect the  distressed, to speak the truth, to keep his word to all, to be  courteous and gentle to women, to defend right against might, and to do  or say nothing that should sully the fair name of Christian knighthood.    Although, therefore, these stories of King Arthur and his men treat of  knights and their ladies, of magical trolls and wonder-working wizards,  and it might seem for that reason that they can have little or nothing  in common with life of the present day, it will be seen that the spirit  in which they are told conveys something which every boy can learn.    Indeed, the great and simple lesson of chivalry which the tales of King  Arthur teach is, in a few words, to merit 'the fine old name of  gentleman.'    The history of King Arthur and his Knights is contained in two books,  one being the _Morte D'Arthur_, written by Sir Thomas Malory, the other  being the _Mabinogion_, a collection of old Welsh stories, first  translated by Lady Charlotte Guest in 1838. I have selected thirteen  tales from the number which these two books contain; but there are many  more, equally as interesting, which remain.    Little is known about Sir Thomas Malory, who lived in the fifteenth  century. We only learn that he was a Welshman, a man of heroic mind  who, as an old writer relates, 'from his youth, greatly shone in the  gifts of mind and body.' Though much busied with cares of state, his  favourite recreation was said to be the reading of history, and in this  pursuit 'he made selections from various authors concerning the valour  and the victories of the most renowned King Arthur of the Britons.' We  know, further, that these selections or tales were translated mostly  from poems about Arthur written by old French poets in the eleventh and  twelfth centuries, and that Sir Thomas Malory finished his translation  in the ninth year of King Edward the Fourth (1469). This, of course,  was before printing was introduced into England, but no doubt many  written copies were made of the book, so as to enable the stories to be  read to the lords and ladies and other rich people who would desire to  hear about the flower of kings and chivalry, the great King Arthur.  When, in 1477, Caxton set up his printing press at Westminster, the  _Morte D'Arthur_ was one of the books which then saw the light of day.    The _Mabinogion_, which contains other tales about King Arthur, is a  collection of old Welsh romances. Though our earliest collection of  them is to be found in a manuscript written in the thirteenth or  fourteenth century, some of them are probably as old as the time when  Welshmen clothed themselves in the skins of the beaver and the bear,  and used stone for their tools and weapons.    It may be that, when you get older, you will go back to the two books I  have mentioned, and you will find them so fascinating that you will be  impatient of any other book which pretends to tell you the same tales.  But until that time arrives, I hope you will find the stories as I have  told them quite interesting and exciting.    HENRY GILBERT.    _June_ 1911.

He had been long sick with a wasting  disease, and forced to lie in his bed, gnawing his beard with wrath at  his weakness, while the pagan Saxons ravened up and down the fair broad  lands, leaving in their tracks the smoking ruin of broken towns and  desolated villages, where mothers lay dead beside their children on the  hearths, fair churches stood pillaged and desecrated, and priests and  nuns wandered in the wilds.    At length, when the pagans, bold and insolent, had ventured near  London, the king had been able to bear his shame and anguish no longer.  He had put himself, in a litter, at the head of his army, and meeting  the fierce, brave pagans at Verulam (now called St. Albans) he had, in  a battle day-long and stubborn, forced them at length to fly with heavy  slaughter.    That was three days ago, and since then he had lain in his bed as still  as if he were dead; and beside him sat the wise wizard Merlin, white  with great age, and in his eyes the calmness of deep learning.    It was the third night when the king suddenly awoke from his stupor and  clutched the hand of Merlin.    'I have dreamed!' he said in a low shaken voice. 'I have seen two  dragons fighting--one white, the other red. First the white dragon got  the mastery, and clawed with iron talons the red one's crest, and drove  him hither and thither into holes and crannies of the rocks. And then  the red one took heart, and with a fury that was marvellous to see, he  drove and tore the white dragon full terribly, and anon the white one  crawled away sore wounded. And the red dragon walked up and down in the  place of his triumph, and grew proud, and fought smaller red dragons  and conquered. Thus for a long time he stayed, and was secure and  boastful. Then I saw the white dragon return with a rage that was very  terrible, and the red dragon fought with him; but his pride had  softened him, so he drew off. Then other red dragons came upon him in  his wounds and beat him sore, which seeing, the white dragon dashed  upon them all--and I awoke. Merlin, tell me what this may mean, for my  mind is sore distraught with the vision.'    Then Merlin looked at the trembling king, wasted with disease, and in  his wise heart was great pity.    'It means, lord,' he said in slow grave tones, 'that thy people shall  conquer--that a red dragon shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#1)"],[1,"(https://www.pgdp.net)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the many original illustrations.

Among those who have more recently devoted  their energies to the subject may be mentioned W.J. Lawrence, T.S.  Graves, G.F. Reynolds, V.E. Albright, A.H. Thorndike, and B.  Neuendorff, each of whom has embodied the results of his  investigations in one or more noteworthy volumes. But the history of  the playhouses themselves, a topic equally important, has not hitherto  been attempted. If we omit the brief notices of the theatres in Edmond  Malone's _The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare_ (1790) and John  Payne Collier's _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1831), the  sole book dealing even in part with the topic is T.F. Ordish's _The  Early London Theatres in the Fields_. This book, however, though good  for its time, was written a quarter of a century ago, before most of  the documents relating to early theatrical history were discovered,  and it discusses only six playhouses. The present volume takes  advantage of all the materials made available by the industry of later  scholars, and records the history of seventeen regular, and five  temporary or projected, theatres. The book is throughout the result of  a first-hand examination of original sources, and represents an  independent interpretation of the historical evidences. As a  consequence of this, as well as of a comparison (now for the first  time possible) of the detailed records of the several playhouses, many  conclusions long held by scholars have been set aside. I have made no  systematic attempt to point out the cases in which I depart from  previously accepted opinions, for the scholar will discover them for  himself; but I believe I have never thus departed without being aware  of it, and without having carefully weighed the entire evidence.  Sometimes the evidence has been too voluminous or complex for detailed  presentation; in these instances I have had to content myself with  reference by footnotes to the more significant documents bearing on  the point.    In a task involving so many details I cannot hope to have escaped  errors--errors due not only to oversight, but also to the limitations  of my knowledge or to mistaken interpretation. For such I can offer no  excuse, though I may request from my readers the same degree of  tolerance which I have tried to show other laborers in the field. In  reproducing old documents I have as a rule modernized the spelling and  the punctuation, for in a work of this character there seems to be no  advantage in preserving the accidents and perversities of early  scribes and printers. I have also consistently altered the dates when  the Old Style conflicted with our present usage.    I desire especially to record my indebtedness to the researches of  Professor C.W. Wallace, the extent of whose services to the study of  the Tudor-Stuart drama has not yet been generally realized, and has  sometimes been grudgingly acknowledged; and to the labors of Mr. E.K.  Chambers and Mr. W.W. Greg, who, in the _Collections_ of The Malone  Society, and elsewhere, have rendered accessible a wealth of important  material dealing with the early history of the stage.    Finally, I desire to express my gratitude to Mr. Hamilton Bell and the  editor of _The Architectural Record_ for permission to reproduce the  illustration and description of Inigo Jones's plan of the Cockpit; to  the Governors of Dulwich College for permission to reproduce three  portraits from the Dulwich Picture Gallery, one of which, that of Joan  Alleyn, has not previously been reproduced; to Mr. C.W. Redwood,  formerly technical artist at Cornell University, for expert assistance  in making the large map of London showing the sites of the playhouses,  and for other help generously rendered; and to my colleagues,  Professor Lane Cooper and Professor Clark S. Northup, for their  kindness in reading the proofs.    JOSEPH QUINCY ADAMS    ITHACA, NEW YORK          CONTENTS          I. THE INN-YARDS                                                 1       II.
