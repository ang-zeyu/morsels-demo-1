The story of the war in which the power of the great Mahratta  confederacy was broken is one of the most stirring pages of the  campaigns which, begun by Clive, ended in the firm establishment of  our great empire in the Indian Peninsula. When the struggle began,  the Mahrattas were masters of no small portion of India; their  territory comprising the whole country between Bombay and Delhi,  and stretching down from Rajputana to Allahabad; while in the south  they were lords of the district of Cuttack, thereby separating  Madras from Calcutta. The jealousies of the great Mahratta leaders,  Holkar and Scindia, who were constantly at war with each other, or  with the Peishwa at Poona, greatly facilitated our operations; and  enabled us, although at the cost of much blood, to free a large  portion of India from a race that was a scourge--faithless,  intriguing and crafty; cruel, and reckless of life. The Mahrattas,  conquering race as they were, yet failed in the one virtue of  courage. They could sweep the land with hordes of wild horsemen,  could harry peaceful districts and tyrannize over the towns they  conquered; but they were unable to make an effective stand against  British bayonets and British sabres. They were a race of  freebooters; and even the most sentimental humanitarian can feel no  regret at the overthrow of a power that possessed no single claim  to our admiration, and weighed like an incubus upon the peoples it  oppressed. The history of the Mahrattas, as written by Grant Duff,  whose account I have, throughout, followed, is one long record of  perfidy, murder, and crime of all sorts.        Chapter 1: A Faithful Nurse.      On a swell of ground, in the wild country extending from Bombay to  the foot of the Ghauts, stood a small camp. In the centre was a  large pavilion; the residence, for the time, of Major Lindsay, an  officer whose charge was to keep the peace in the district. It was  no easy matter. The inhabitants, wild and lawless, lived in small  villages scattered about the rough country, for the most part  covered with forest, and subject to depredations by the robber  bands who had their strongholds among the hills. Major Lindsay had  with him a party of twenty troopers, not for defence--there was  little fear of attack by the natives of the Concan--but to add to  his authority, to aid in the collection of the small tax paid by  each community, and to deter the mountain robbers from descending  on to the plain. He generally spent the cool season in going his  rounds while, during the hot weather, his headquarters were at  Bombay.    He had with him his wife and infant child. The child was some three  months old, and was looked after by an ayah, who had been in Major  Lindsay's service ten years; for three elder children had been born  to him--all, however, dying from the effects of the climate before  reaching the age of five. The ayah had nursed each, in succession,  and had become greatly attached to the family, especially to her  youngest charge. She had come to speak English well; but with the  child she always talked in her native tongue, as the major saw the  advantage it would prove to the boy, when he grew up, to be able to  speak fluently one, at least, of the native languages.    The nurse was a Mahratta. She had been in the service of the  British Resident at Poona and, when he was recalled, had entered  that of Major Lindsay, at that time a captain who acted as  secretary to the Resident.    A young officer from Bombay had just ridden out, to spend a day or  two with the major, and was sitting with him at the entrance to the  tent.    \"The news from the army,\" he said, \"is most unsatisfactory. As you  know, to the astonishment of everyone Colonel Egerton was appointed  to the command, in spite of the fact that he was so infirm as to be  altogether unfit for active service; and Mostyn, our late Resident  at Poona, and Carnac accompanied him as deputies of the Council.\"    \"That is altogether a bad arrangement,\" the major said. \"It has  always been a great disadvantage for a general to be accompanied by  civilians, with power to thwart his combinations. Against Mostyn's  appointment no one could raise any objection as, having been for  some years at Poona, he understands the Mahrattas, and indeed is  much liked by them, so that in any negotiations he would have far  more chance of success than a stranger; but Carnac is hot headed  and obstinate, with a very high idea of his own importance, and it  is certain that there will be difficulties between him and  Egerton.\"    \"I am sorry to say, Major, that these anticipations were very  speedily verified. As you know, the advance party landed at Aptee,  on November 23rd, and seized the roads over the gorge; and on the  25th the main body disembarked at Panwell. No sooner had they got  there than there was a quarrel between Egerton and Carnac. Most  unfortunately Mostyn, who would have acted as mediator, was taken  ill on the very day after landing, and was obliged to return to  Bombay; and I hear there is hardly any chance of his recovery. The  army did not reach the top of the Ghauts till the 23rd of  December--instead of, at the latest, three days after landing--and  actually spent eleven days before it arrived at Karlee, only eight  miles in advance of the Bhore Ghauts. Of course this encouraged the  enemy, and gave plenty of time for them to assemble and make all  their arrangements and, when we last heard, they were harassing our  march. For the past two days no news has arrived, and there seems  to be little doubt that the Mahrattas have closed in round their  rear, and cut off all communications.\"    \"It is monstrous that they should march so slowly. The whole thing  has been a hideous blunder, and the idea of encumbering a force of  four thousand men with something like thirty thousand camp  followers, and with a train of no less than nineteen thousand  bullocks, to say nothing of other draught animals, is the most  preposterous thing I ever heard of. In fact, the whole thing has  been grossly mismanaged.    \"I don't say that the conduct of the Mahrattas has not for some  time been doubtful, if not threatening. It is well known that the  Governor General and the Council at Calcutta have most strongly  disapproved of the whole conduct of the Council at Bombay. Indeed,  no explanation has ever been given as to why they took up the cause  of Rugoba, the scoundrel who grasped the crown; and who was privy  to, if he did not instigate, the murder of his nephew, the young  Peishwa.    \"He was not unopposed, for Nana Furnuwees and Hurry Punt, two of  the leading Mahratta ministers, formed a regency under Gunga Bye,  the widow of the murdered Peishwa. While matters were undecided,  the Bombay Council opened communications with Rugoba, who they  thought was likely to be successful; and promised to assist him, if  he would advance a considerable sum of money, and cede to the  Company Salsette, the small islands contiguous to Bombay and  Bassein, which had been captured from the Portuguese by the  Mahrattas--an altogether inexcusable arrangement, as the Mahrattas  were at peace with us, and Rugoba was not in a position to hand the  islands over. That matter, however, was settled by sending an  expedition, which captured Salsette and Tannah in 1775, four years  ago. Since then Rugoba has become a fugitive and, without a shadow  of reason, is making war against the whole force of the Mahratta  confederacy; who, although divided amongst themselves and  frequently engaged in the struggles for supremacy, have united  against us--for they say that Scindia, Holkar, and Hurry Punt are  in command of their army. To send four thousand men, of whom less  than six hundred are Europeans, against the whole Mahratta power is  a desperate step.    \"I know we have fought and won against greater odds, many times in  the history of India; but our forces have always been well led,  marched with the smallest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net/c/)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustration.

A SURPRISE 249          FOR THE SAKE OF THE SCHOOL          CHAPTER I    The Woodlands      \"Are they never going to turn up?\"    \"It's almost four now!\"    \"They'll be left till the six-thirty!\"    \"Oh, don't alarm yourself! The valley train always waits for the  express.\"    \"It's coming in now!\"    \"Oh, good, so it is!\"    \"Late by twenty minutes exactly!\"    \"Stand back there!\" yelled a porter, setting down a box with a slam, and  motioning the excited, fluttering group of girls to a position of  greater safety than the extreme edge of the platform. \"Llangarmon  Junction! Change for Glanafon and Graigwen!\"    Snorting and puffing, as if in agitated apology for the tardiness of its  arrival, the train came steaming into the station, the drag of its  brakes adding yet another item of noise to the prevailing babel.  Intending passengers clutched bags and baskets; fathers of families gave  a last eye to the luggage; mothers grasped children firmly by the hand;  a distracted youth, seeking vainly for his portmanteau, upset a stack of  bicycles with a crash; while above all the din and turmoil rose the  strident, rasping voice of a book-stall boy, crying his selection of  papers with ear-splitting zeal.    From the windows of the in-coming express waved seventeen agitated  pocket-handkerchiefs, and the signal was answered by a counter-display  of cambric from the twenty girls hustled back by an inspector in the  direction of the weighing-machine.    \"There's Helen!\"    \"And Ruth, surely!\"    \"Oh! where's Marjorie?\"    \"There! Can't you see her, with Doris?\"    \"That's Mamie, waving to me!\"    \"What's become of Kathleen?\"    One moment more, and the neat school hats of the new-comers had swelled  the group of similar school hats already collected on the platform;  ecstatic greetings were exchanged, urgent questions asked and hasty  answers given, and items of choice information poured forth with the  utmost volubility of which the English tongue is capable. Urged by brief  directions from a mistress in charge, the chattering crew surged towards  a siding, and made for a particular corridor carriage marked \"Reserved\".  Here handbags, umbrellas, wraps, and lunch-baskets were hastily stowed  away in the racks, and, Miss Moseley having assured herself that not a  single lamb of her flock was left behind, the grinning porter slammed  the doors, the green flag waved, and the local train, long overdue,  started with a jerk for the Craigwen Valley.    Past the grey old castle that looked seawards over the estuary, past the  little white town of Llangarmon, with its ancient walls and fortified  gates, past the quay where the fishing smacks were lying idly at anchor  and a pleasure-steamer was unloading its human cargo, past the long  stretch of sandy common, where the white tents of the Territorials  evoked an outcry of interest, then up alongside the broad tidal river  towards where the mountains, faint and misty, rose shouldering one  another till they merged into the white nebulous region of the  cloud-flecked sky. Those lucky ones who had secured window seats on the  river side of the carriage were loud in their acclamations of  satisfaction as familiar objects in the landscape came into sight.    \"There's Cwm Dinas. I wish they could float a big Union Jack on the  summit.\"    \"It would be a landmark all right.\"    \"Oh, the flag's up at Plas Cafn!\"    \"We'll have one at school this term?\"    \"Oh, I say! Move a scrap,\" pleaded Ulyth Stanton plaintively. \"We only  get fields and woods on our side. I can't see anything at all for your  heads. You might move. What selfish pigs you are! Well, I don't care;  I'm going to talk.\"    \"You have been talking already. You've never stopped, in fact,\" remarked  Beth Broadway, proffering a swiftly disappearing packet of pear drops  with a generosity born of the knowledge that all sweets would be  confiscated on arrival at The Woodlands.    \"I know I have, but that was merely by the way. It wasn't anything very  particular, and I've got something I want to tell you--something  fearfully important. Absolutely super! D'you know, she's actually coming  to school. Isn't it great? She's to be my room-mate. I'm just wild to  see her. I hope her ship won't be stopped by storms.\"    \"By the Muses, whom are you talking about?\"    \"'She' means the cat,\" sniggered Gertrude Oliver.    \"Why! can't you guess? What stupids you are! It's Rona, of course--Rona  Mitchell from New Zealand.\"    \"You're ragging!\"    \"It's a fact. It is indeed!\"    The incredulity on the countenances of her companions having yielded to  an expression of interest, Ulyth continued her information with  increased zest, and a conscious though would-be nonchalant air of  importance.    \"Her father wants her to go to school in England, so he decided to send  her to The Woodlands, so that she might be with me!\"    \"Do you mean that girl you were so very proud of corresponding with? I  forget how the whole business began,\" broke in Stephanie Radford.    \"Don't you remember? It was through a magazine we take. The editor  arranged for readers of the magazine in England to exchange letters with  other readers overseas. He gave me Rona. We've been writing to each  other every month for two years.\"    \"I had an Australian, but she wouldn't write regularly, so we dropped  it,\" volunteered Beth Broadway. \"I believe Gertrude had somebody too.\"    \"Yes, a girl in Canada. I never got farther than one short letter and a  picture post card, though. I do so loathe writing,\" sighed Gertrude.  \"Ulyth's the only one who's kept the thing up.\"    \"And do you mean to say this New Zealander's actually coming to our  school?\" asked Stephanie.    \"That's the joysome gist of my remarks! I can't tell you how I'm pining  and yearning to see her. She seems like a girl out of a story. To think  of it! Rona Mitchell at school with us!\"    \"Suppose you don't like her?\"    \"Oh, I'm certain I shall! She's written me the jolliest, loveliest,  funniest letters! I feel I know her already. We shall be the very best  of friends. Her father has a huge farm of I can't tell you how many  miles, and she has two horses of her own, and fords rivers when she's  out riding.\"    \"When's she to arrive?\"    \"Probably to-morrow. She's travelling by the _King George_, and coming  up straight from London to school directly she lands. I hope she's got  to England safely. She must have left home ever such a long time ago.  How fearfully exciting for her to----\"    But here Ulyth's reflections were brought to an abrupt close, for the  train was approaching Glanafon Ferry, and her comrades, busily  collecting their various handbags, would lend no further ear to her  remarks.    The little wayside station, erstwhile the quietest and sleepiest on the  line, was soon overflowing with girls and their belongings. Miss Moseley  flitted up and down the platform, marshalling her charges like a  faithful collie, the one porter did his slow best, and after a few  agitated returns to the compartments for forgotten articles, everything  was successfully collected, and the train went steaming away down the  valley in the direction of Craigwen. It seemed to take the last link of  civilization with it, and to leave only the pure, unsullied country  behind. The girls crossed the line and walked through the white station  gate with pleased anticipation writ large on their faces. It was the  cult at The Woodlands to idolize nature and the picturesque, and they  had reached a part of their journey which was a particular source of  pride to the school.    Any admirer of scenery would have been struck with the lovely and  romantic view which burst upon the eye as the travellers left the  platform at Glanafon and walked down the short, grassy road that led to  the ferry. To the south stretched the wide pool of the river, blue as  the heaven above where it caught the reflection of the September sky,  but dark and mysterious where it mirrored the thick woods that shaded  its banks. Near at hand towered the tall, heather-crowned crag of Cwm  Dinas, while the rugged peaks of Penllwyd and Penglaslyn frowned in  majesty of clouds beyond. The ferry itself was one of those delightful  survivals of mediaevalism which linger here and there in a few"]]]
