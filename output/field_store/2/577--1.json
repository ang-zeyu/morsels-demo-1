[Illustration]    THE TALE OF MR. TOD      I have made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I  am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy  Brock and Mr. Tod.    Nobody could call Mr. Tod \"nice.\" The rabbits could not bear him; they  could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had  foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.    [Illustration]    One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to  the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard  willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.    In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth  amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.    He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.    The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved _out_; because  sometimes Tommy Brock moved _in_; (without asking leave).    Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he  grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp  nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging  things up.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always  went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was  generally Mr. Tod's.    Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very  little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He  was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked  otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.    Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine  outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.    He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who  had a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that  afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes  and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow  burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth--old Mr.  Bouncer had forgotten them.    He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was  passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for  digging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the  scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And  the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in  winter--\"I have not had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living  on pig-nuts. I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!\" said  Tommy Brock.    [Illustration]    It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy  Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.    So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to  taste a slice of seed-cake and \"a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip  wine.\" Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.    [Illustration]    Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage  leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more  than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and  laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.    And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the  cabbage smoke....    When Flopsy and Benjamin came back--old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock  and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!    Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the  rabbit hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were  round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her  ears, and slapped him.    [Illustration]    Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.    There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot-mark  and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had  rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole  for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the  way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps  showed plainly in the mud.    The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared;  there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths--but the smell  that made Benjamin stop, was _not_ the smell of flowers!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Mr. Tod's stick house was before him and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home.  There was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it--there was smoke  coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.    Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick  house somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his  foot, and bolted.    He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently  Tommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there  were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught  on a briar.    Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole  trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was  getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy  the evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily  hunting for dandelions.--\"Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!\"  shouted Benjamin Bunny.    The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears--    [Illustration]    \"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat  Ferret?\"    \"No, no, no! He's bagged my family--Tommy Brock--in a sack--have you  seen him?\"    \"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?\"    \"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way?  Please tell me quick!\"    [Illustration]    \"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since ... he said they were _caterpillars_; I  did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars.\"    \"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?\"    \"He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole  trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning.\"  Benjamin did so.    [Illustration]    \"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his  years;\" said Peter reflectively, \"but there are two hopeful  circumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had  refreshment. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast.\"  \"Which way?\" \"Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which  way. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to Mr.  Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he  offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be  passing.\" (Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on  the hill).    Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was  all of a twitter. They crossed several fields and began to climb the  hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to  have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.    \"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent. What a  nasty person!\" said Peter.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way  up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown  little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.    Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether  her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice  while she watched him.    He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with  laughing.--\"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!\"  said Benjamin Bunny.    They climbed up and up;--\"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping  out of the hole.\" \"They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their  neighbours. Come on, Cousin Benjamin!\"    When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went  cautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a  crag--Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep  bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully,  listening and peeping.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown  pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.    The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the  kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the  rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.    Benjamin sighed with relief.    [Illustration]    But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him  shudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and  a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.    At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate,  a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair--in short,  preparations for one person's supper.    [Illustration]    No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty  and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their  noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.    Then they scrambled round "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19807"],[0,"Sketch of Grammar of the Chippeway Languages (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by the Canadian Institute for Historical Microreproductions  (www.canadiana.org))          [Transcriber's Note:    This is an updated version of an e-text originally produced in November  2006; see end of text for additions and corrections.
