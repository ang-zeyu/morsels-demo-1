The object of this series of text-books is to provide concise  teachable histories of art for class-room use in schools and colleges.  The limited time given to the study of art in the average educational  institution has not only dictated the condensed style of the volumes,  but has limited their scope of matter to the general features of art  history. Archaeological discussions on special subjects and aesthetic  theories have been avoided. The main facts of history as settled by  the best authorities are given. If the reader choose to enter into  particulars the bibliography cited at the head of each chapter will be  found helpful. Illustrations have been introduced as sight-help to the  text, and, to avoid repetition, abbreviations have been used wherever  practicable. The enumeration of the principal extant works of an  artist, school, or period, and where they may be found, which follows  each chapter, may be serviceable not only as a summary of individual  or school achievement, but for reference by travelling students in  Europe.    This volume on painting, the first of the series, omits mention of  such work in Arabic, Indian, Chinese, and Persian art as may come  properly under the head of Ornament--a subject proposed for separate  treatment hereafter. In treating of individual painters it has been  thought best to give a short critical estimate of the man and his rank  among the painters of his time rather than the detailed facts of his  life. Students who wish accounts of the lives of the painters should  use Vasari, Larousse, and the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ in connection  with this text-book.    Acknowledgments are made to the respective publishers of Woltmann and  Woermann's History of Painting, and the fine series of art histories  by Perrot and Chipiez, for permission to reproduce some few  illustrations from these publications.
