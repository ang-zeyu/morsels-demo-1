About the year 1890 the writer was requested by the Director of the  Bureau of Ethnology to prepare certain papers on aboriginal art, to  accompany the final report of Dr. Cyrus Thomas on his explorations of  mounds and other ancient remains in eastern United States. These papers  were to treat of those arts represented most fully by relics recovered  in the field explored. They included studies of the art of pottery, of  the textile art and of art in shell, and a paper on native tobacco  pipes. Three of these papers were already completed when it was decided  to issue the main work of Dr. Thomas independently of the several papers  prepared by his associates. It thus happens that the present paper,  written to form a limited section of a work restricted to narrow  geographic limits, covers so small a fragment of the aboriginal textile  field.    The materials considered in this paper include little not germane to the  studies conducted by Dr. Thomas in the mound region, the collections  used having been made largely by members of the Bureau of Ethnology  acting under his supervision. Two or three papers have already been  published in the annual reports of the Bureau in which parts of the same  collections have been utilized, and a few of the illustrations prepared  for these papers are reproduced in this more comprehensive study.    Until within the last few years textile fabrics have hardly been  recognized as having a place among the materials to be utilized in the  discussion of North American archeology. Recent studies of the art of  the mound-building tribes have, however, served to demonstrate their  importance, and the evidence now furnished by this art can be placed  alongside of that of arts in clay, stone, and metal, as a factor in  determining the culture status of the prehistoric peoples and in  defining their relations to the historic Indians. This change is due to  the more careful investigations of recent times, to the utilization of  new lines of archeologic research, and to the better knowledge of the  character and scope of historic and modern native art. A comparison of  the textiles obtained from ancient mounds and graves with the work of  living tribes has demonstrated their practical identity in materials, in  processes of manufacture, and in articles produced. Thus another  important link is added to the chain that binds together the ancient and  the modern tribes.      DEFINITION OF THE ART.    The textile art dates back to the very inception of culture, and its  practice is next to universal among living peoples. In very early stages  of culture progress it embraced the stems of numerous branches of  industry afterward differentiated through the utilization of other  materials or through the employment of distinct systems of construction.  At all periods of cultural development it has been a most indispensable  art, and with some peoples it has reached a marvelous perfection, both  technically and esthetically.    Woven fabrics include all those products of art in which the elements or  parts employed in construction are more or less filamental, and are  combined by methods conditioned chiefly by their flexibility. The  processes employed are known by such terms as wattling, interlacing,  plaiting, netting, weaving, sewing, and embroidering.      MATERIALS AND PROCESSES.    Viewing the entire textile field, we find that the range of products is  extremely wide. On the one hand there is the rude interlacing of  branches, vines, roots, and canes in constructing houses, weirs, cages,  rafts, bridges, and the like, and on the other, the spinning of threads  of almost microscopic fineness and the weaving of textures of marvelous  delicacy and beauty.    The more cultured peoples of Central America and South America had  accomplished wonders in the use of the loom and the embroidery frame,  but the work of the natives of the United States was on a decidedly  lower plane. In basketry and certain classes of garment-making, the  inhabitants of the Mississippi valley were well advanced at the period  of European conquest, and there is ample evidence to show that the  mound-building peoples were not behind historic tribes in this matter.  In many sections of our country the art is still practiced, and with a  technical perfection and an artistic refinement of high order, as the  splendid collections in our museums amply show.    The degree of success in the textile art is not necessarily a reliable  index of the culture status of the peoples concerned, as progress in a  particular art depends much upon the encouragement given to it by local  features of environment. The tribe that had good clay used earthenware  and neglected basketry, and the community well supplied with skins of  animals did not need to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)                    VILLA ELSA    _A Story of German Family Life_    BY    STUART HENRY      NEW YORK  E. P. DUTTON & COMPANY  681 FIFTH AVENUE      COPYRIGHT 1920, BY  E. P. DUTTON & COMPANY    _All Rights Reserved_    _Printed in the United States of America_          TO    Pat and Anna    IN LOVING TOKEN OF OUR WINTER'S  CONVERSATIONS ON THE GERMANS          FOREWORD      This narrative offers a gentle but permanent answer to the problem  presented to humanity by the German people. It seeks to go beyond  the stage of indemnities, diplomatic or trade control, peace by  armed preponderance. These agencies do not take into account Teuton  nature, character, manner of living, beliefs.    Unless the Germans are changed, the world will live at swords'  points with them both in theory and in practice. Whether they are  characteristically Huns or not, it should be tragically realized  that something ought to be done to alter their type. Their minds,  hearts, souls, should be touched in a direct, personal, intimate  way. There should be a natural relationship of good feeling, an  intelligent and _lived_ mutual experience, worked up, brought  about. A League of Nations, of Peace, inevitably based on some sort  of force, should be followed by a truly human programme leading to  the amicable conversion of that race, if it is at heart unrepentant,  crafty, murderous.    In the absence of any particular heed being paid to this underlying,  fundamental subject, the present pages suggest for it a vital  solution that seems both easy and practical and would promise to  relieve anxiety as to an indefinitely uncertain, ugly future ahead  of harassed mankind.    How shall the German be treated in the present century and beyond?    To try to answer this aright, it is obviously necessary to know what  the German is--what he is really like. To know him at his best, in  his truest colors, is to live with him in his most normal condition,  and that is at his fireside, surrounded by his family. This aspect  has been the least fully presented during the war. What the Teuton  military and political chieftains, clergymen, professors, captains  of industry, editors and other men of position have said, how they  have conducted themselves toward the rest of humanity, is  notoriously and distressingly familiar. But what the ordinary,  educated German of peaceful pursuits, staying by his hearthstone  far behind and safe from the battle line, thought and wished to  say, has been beyond our ken. There has been no way to get at him  or hear from him as to what lay frankly in his mind.    His leaders loudly proclaimed themselves to be as terrifying as Huns  and unblushingly gloried in this profession. Has he agreed or has he  silently disagreed? Has he too wished this or has he been unwilling?  Is he essentially a Hun, are his family essentially Huns, or are  they in reality good and kindly people like our people? Are they  temporarily misled?    The humble German families of education who are hospitable, who sing  and weep over sentimental songs in their homes, whose duties are  modest and revenues small, who have never been out of their  provinces, who have had no relations with foreigners and could have  no personal cause for hatred--have they been so bloodthirsty about  killing and pillaging in alien lands?    Villa Elsa contains a family immune from any foreign influence and  matured in the most regular and unsuspecting Teuton way. The German  household is the most thoroughly instructed of all households. Its  members are disciplined to do most things well. How can it then be  Hun in any considerable degree? Impossible, said the nations, and so  they remained illy prepared against a frenzied onslaught. But a  shocked public has beheld how readily the most erudite of mankind,  as the Germans were generally held to be, could officially,  deliberately and repeatedly as soldiers, singly and _en masse_,  act like their ancestors--the barbarians of the days of Attila.    These are all puzzling queries which this story attempts to  illuminate and solve by its pictures and observations of the  life of such a modest and typical Teuton home in 1913 and 1914.  Admittedly too much light, too much study, cannot be given to  the greatest issue civilization as a whole has faced.    Villa Elsa is but Germany in miniature. In the significant  character, habits and activities of this household may be found  the true pith and essence of real Germanism as normally developed.  This Germanism appears ready to continue after the War to be the  malignant and would-be assassin of other civilizations. It is,  therefore, tragically important to find and act on the right  answer to the question:    Is there any possible way to make the Germans become true,  peace-loving friends with us--with the rest of mankind?

A SOLUTION          347          VILLA ELSA    CHAPTER I    TRIUMPHANT GERMANY IN 1913      In the late summer of 1913 a quiet American college man of  twenty-three, tall, lean, somewhat listless in bearing, who had  been idling on a trip in Germany without a thought of adventure,  was observing, without being able to define or understand, one of  the most remarkable conditions of national and racial exhilaration  that ever blessed a country in time of ripest peace.    He had never been out of America, and supposed his Yankee people,  with all their wide liberty, contemplated life with as much  enjoyment as any other. But in that land which is governed with  iron, where (as Bismarck said) a man cannot even get up out of his  bed and walk to a window without breaking a law, Gard Kirtley was  finding something different, strange, wonderful, in the way of  marked happiness. It pulsated everywhere, in every man, woman and  child. It seemed to be a sensation of victory, yet there had been  no victory. It appeared to reflect some mighty distinctive human  achievement or event of which a whole race could be proud in  unison. There had been nothing of the sort.    And yet it was there, a certain exuberance. The people, with heads  carried high, quickly moving feet and pockets full of money, were  enlivened by a public joyousness because they were humans and,  above all, because they were Germans. It seemed a joy of human  prestige, of wholesale well-being, of an assuredly auspicious  future. Multitudes of toasts were being drunk. The marching and  counter-marching of soldiers looked excessive even for Germany. A  season of patriotic holidays was apparently at hand. Festivals,  public rites, celebrated the widespread exultation. The whole  country conducted itself as on parade, _en fete_.    Wages were higher and comforts greater than ever known there. For  the first time chambermaids often drank champagne and wore on their  heads lop-sided creations of expensive millinery with confident  awkwardness--creations which they said came from Paris. The chimney  sweeps had high hats and smoked good tobacco which they may have  thought came from London. For the imported was the high water mark  of plenty in Germany as always elsewhere, though she claimed to make  the best goods.    The scene should not be painted in too high colors--colors too  fixed. To the careless observer it doubtless appeared little  different from the annual flowering forth of the German "]]]
