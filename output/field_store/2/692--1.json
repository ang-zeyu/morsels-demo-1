SEVEN DISCOURSES ON ART  by Joshua Reyonds      INTRODUCTION      It is a happy memory that associates the foundation of our Royal Academy  with the delivery of these inaugural discourses by Sir Joshua Reynolds,  on the opening of the schools, and at the first annual meetings for the  distribution of its prizes.  They laid down principles of art from the  point of view of a man of genius who had made his power felt, and with  the clear good sense which is the foundation of all work that looks  upward and may hope to live.  The truths here expressed concerning Art  may, with slight adjustment of the way of thought, be applied to  Literature or to any exercise of the best powers of mind for shaping the  delights that raise us to the larger sense of life.  In his separation of  the utterance of whole truths from insistance upon accidents of detail,  Reynolds was right, because he guarded the expression of his view with  careful definitions of its limits.  In the same way Boileau was right, as  a critic of Literature, in demanding everywhere good sense, in condemning  the paste brilliants of a style then in decay, and fixing attention upon  the masterly simplicity of Roman poets in the time of Augustus.  Critics  by rule of thumb reduced the principles clearly defined by Boileau to a  dull convention, against which there came in course of time a strong  reaction.  In like manner the teaching of Reynolds was applied by dull  men to much vague and conventional generalisation in the name of dignity.  Nevertheless, Reynolds taught essential truths of Art.  The principles  laid down by him will never fail to give strength to the right artist, or  true guidance towards the appreciation of good art, though here and there  we may not wholly assent to some passing application of them, where the  difference may be great between a fashion of thought in his time and in  ours.  A righteous enforcement of exact truth in our day has led many  into a readiness to appreciate more really the minute imitation of a  satin dress, or a red herring, than the noblest figure in the best of  Raffaelle's cartoons.  Much good should come of the diffusion of this  wise little book.    Joshua Reynolds was born on the 15th of July, 1723, the son of a  clergyman and schoolmaster, at Plympton in Devonshire.  His bent for Art  was clear and strong from his childhood.  In 1741 at the age of nineteen,  he began study, and studied for two yours in London under Thomas Hudson,  a successful portrait painter.  Then he went back to Devonshire and  painted portraits, aided for some time in his education by attention to  the work of William Gandy of Exeter.  When twenty-six years old, in May,  1749, Reynolds was taken away by Captain Keppel to the Mediterranean, and  brought into contact with the works of the great painters of Italy.  He  stayed two years in Rome, and in accordance with the principles  afterwards laid down in these lectures, he refused, when in Rome,  commissions for copying, and gave his mind to minute observation of the  art of the great masters by whose works he was surrounded.  He spent two  months in Florence, six weeks in Venice, a few days in Bologna and Parma.  \"If,\" he said, \"I had never seen any of the fine works of Correggio, I  should never, perhaps, have remarked in Nature the expression which I  find in one of his pieces; or if I had remarked it, I might have thought  it too difficult, or perhaps impossible to execute.\"    In 1753 Reynolds came back to England, and stayed three months in  Devonshire before setting up a studio in London, in St. Martin's Lane,  which was then an artists' quarter.  His success was rapid.  In 1755 he  had one hundred and twenty-five sitters.  Samuel Johnson found in him his  most congenial friend.  He moved to Newport Street, and he built himself  a studio--where there is now an auction room--at 47, Lincoln's Inn  Fields.  There he remained for life.    In 1760 the artists opened, in a room lent by the Society of Arts, a free  Exhibition for the sale of their works.  This was continued the next year  at Spring Gardens, with a charge of a shilling for admission.  In 1765  they obtained a charter of incorporation, and in 1768 the King gave his  support to the foundation of a Royal Academy of Arts by seceders from the  preceding \"Incorporated Society of Artists,\" into which personal feelings  had brought much division.  It was to consist, like the French Academy,  of forty members, and was to maintain Schools open to all students of  good character who could give evidence that they had fully learnt the  rudiments of Art.  The foundation by the King dates from the 10th of  December, 1768.  The Schools were opened on the 2nd of January next  following, and on that occasion Joshua Reynolds, who had been elected  President--his age was then between forty-five and forty-six--gave the  Inaugural Address which formed the first of these Seven Discourses.  The  other six were given by him, as President, at the next six annual  meetings: and they were all shaped to form, when collected into a volume,  a coherent body of good counsel upon the foundations of the painter's  art.    H. M.          TO THE KING      The regular progress of cultivated life is from necessaries to  accommodations, from accommodations to ornaments.  By your illustrious  predecessors were established marts for manufactures, and colleges for  science; but for the arts of elegance, those arts by which manufactures  are embellished and science is refined, to found an academy was reserved  for your Majesty.    Had such patronage been without effect, there had been reason to believe  that nature had, by some insurmountable impediment, obstructed our  proficiency; but the annual improvement of the exhibitions which your  Majesty has been pleased to encourage shows that only encouragement had  been wanting.    To give advice to those who are contending for royal liberality has been  for some years the duty of my station in the Academy; and these  Discourses hope for your Majesty's acceptance as well-intended endeavours  to incite that emulation which your notice has kindled, and direct those  studies which your bounty has rewarded.    May it please your Majesty,  Your Majesty's  Most dutiful servant,  And most faithful subject,  JOSHUA REYNOLDS.          TO THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY.      Gentlemen,--That you have ordered the publication of this Discourse is  not only very flattering to me, as it implies your approbation of the  method of study which I have recommended; but likewise, as this method  receives from that act such an additional weight and authority as demands  from the students that deference and respect, which can be due only to  the united sense of so considerable a body of artists.    I am,  With the greatest esteem and respect,  GENTLEMEN,  Your most humble  And obedient servant,  JOSHUA REYNOLDS          SEVEN DISCOURSES ON ART      A DISCOURSE  Delivered at the Opening of the Royal Academy, January 2nd, 1769, by the  President.      Gentlemen,--An academy in which the polite arts may be regularly  cultivated is at last opened among us by royal munificence.  This must  appear an event in the highest degree interesting, not only to the  artists, but to the whole nation.    It is indeed difficult to give any other reason why an Empire like that  of Britain should so long have wanted an ornament so suitable to its  greatness than that slow progression of things which naturally makes  elegance and refinement the last effect of opulence and power.    An institution like this has often been recommended upon considerations  merely mercantile.  But an academy founded upon such principles can never  effect even its own narrow purposes.  If it has an origin no higher, no  taste can ever be formed in it which can be useful even in manufactures;  but if the higher arts of design flourish, these inferior ends will be  answered of course.    We are happy in having a prince who has conceived the design of such an  institution, according to its true dignity, and promotes the arts, as the  head of a great, a learned, a polite, and a commercial nation; and I can  now congratulate you, gentlemen, on the accomplishment of your long and  ardent wishes.    The numberless and ineffectual consultations that I have had with many in  this assembly, to form plans and concert schemes for an academy, afford a  sufficient proof of the impossibility of succeeding but by the influence  of Majesty.  But there have, perhaps, been times when even the influence  of Majesty would have been ineffectual, and it is pleasing to reflect  that we are thus embodied, when every circumstance seems to concur from  which honour and prosperity can probably arise.    There are at this time a greater number of excellent artists than were  ever known before at one period in this nation; there is a general desire  among our nobility to be distinguished as lovers and judges of the arts;  there is a greater superfluity of wealth among the people to reward the  professors; and, above all, we are patronised by a monarch, who, knowing  the value of science and of elegance, thinks every art worthy of his  notice that tends to soften and humanise the mind.    After so much has been done by his Majesty, it will be wholly our fault  if our progress is not in some degree correspondent to the wisdom and,  generosity of the institution; let us show our gratitude in our  diligence, that, though our merit may not answer his expectations, yet,  at least, our industry may deserve his protection.    But whatever may be our proportion of success, of this we may be sure,  that the present institution will at least contribute to advance our  knowledge of the arts, and bring us nearer to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#1)"],[1,"VERTEBRATA***      E-text Prepared by \"Teary Eyes\" Anderson  and Dedicated To Destanie;  With Hopes Her Dream of Becoming A veterinarian Comes True    Special Thanks to Deborah Furness of the University College London  for her help, and research, in learning about this book, and helping  me understand it better.

I        use the -- for an em-dash, with a space either before or after        it depending on its usage. This helps to keep certain programs        from squishing the words together, such as down-stairs. Also to        help voice speech programs I've enclosed upper case text        between - and _ (-UPPER CASE TEXT_), and used underscores to        show chapter and section headers. I also added a second        contents that shows the other sections of this e-text. This        e-text was made with a \"Top can\" text scanner, with a bit of        correcting here and there.          This book is volume one of two. It was later reworked by A. M.        Davies in 1898 under the title \"Text-book of Zoology\",        then revised and rewritten by J. T. Cunningham about 1909 and        W. H. Leigh-Sharpe around 1932. Although these editions gave        Wells the main credit, most of Wells' writing and all his        drawings were removed; only his rough outline seems to have        been used. It was re-published by University Tutorial Press.          The First Edition, as well as The Second and Revised Edition        (with dissections redrawn by Miss A. C. Robbins) are used in this        e-text. The First Edition had some small minor errors, as well as        dissection abbreviations that are shown on the Dissection Sheets,        but no mention of them was listed in the text. Certain figures on        the Dissections Sheets are missing (such as Figures 1, 2, 4, with        no mention to a 3, as if Mr. Wells drew a Figure 3 but found it        was not needed and removed it from the book). Rather then leaving        it as is, I put {} marks around my notes saying things like        {No Figure 3}. For the \"Second and Revised Edition\" Wells was        able to change some of these errors and missing parts, but many of        the same printing tablets were used and with almost each addition        other things were removed, (in one instance one entire section        from a chapter), and many of the helpful suggestions were        shortened or removed so other things could be explained more. In        an ideal version of the book both could have been used, but with        reprinting the entire book from the first to the second editions        almost as many things were lost as were gained, so I've tried to        indicate where both text go separate paths with the following;        [Second Edition only text] and -First Edition only text,- and also        {Lines from Second Edition only.} and {Lines from First Edition        only.} were more then just a sentence is added or removed. Other        things to notice is how some words are spelt or punctuated        differently throughout the book, such as;        Blood Vessels        Blood-Vessels        Bloodvessels        I've tried to keep these as close to the original book as possible.

Although disposed at the time to ridicule the idea of  imparting instruction in natural science by letter, I gladly accepted  the opportunity thus afforded me of ascertaining for myself what  could and could not be accomplished in that direction. Anyone  familiar with the scope of biological enquiry, and the methods of  biological instruction, will not need to be reminded that it is only by  the most rigorous employment of precise directions for observation,  that any good results are to be looked for at the hand of the  elementary student. True to this principle, I determined to issue to  my correspondence pupils rigid instructions, and to demand in return  faithful annotated drawings of facts observed in their usage. In the  case of two among the few students who passed through my hands,  the result far exceeded my most sanguine anticipations. The notes  sent in by one of them-- a man working at a distance, alone and  unaided-- far excelled those wrung from many a student placed  under the most favourable surroundings; and their promise for the  future has been fulfilled to the utmost, the individual in question  being now a recognised investigator. It thus became clear that,  not-with-standing the complex conditions of work in the biological  field, tuition by correspondence would suffice to awaken the latent  abilities of a naturally qualified enquirer. The average members of a  University Correspondence Class will be found neither better nor  worse than those of any other, and they may therefore pass  unnoticed; if however, the correspondence system of tuition may  furnish the means of arousing a latent aptitude, when the  possibilities of other methods of approach are excluded-- and in  so doing, of elevating the individual to that position for which he was  by nature qualified, ensuring him the introduction to the one sphere  of labour for which he was born-- it will have created its own defence,  and have merited the confidence of all right-thinking people. The  plucking of one such brand from the burning is ample compensation  for the energy expended on any number of average dullards, who but  require to be left alone to find their natural level.    Mr. Wells' little book is avowedly written for examination purposes,  and in conformity with the requirements of the now familiar \"type  system\" of teaching. Recent attempts have been made to depreciate  this. While affording a discipline in detailed observation and  manipulation second to that of no other branch of learning, it  provides for that \"deduction\" and \"verification\" by which all science  has been built up; and this appears to me ample justification for its  retention, as the most rational system which can be to-day adopted.  Evidence that its alleged shortcomings are due rather to defective  handling than to any inherent weakness of its own, would not be  difficult to produce. Although rigid in its discipline, it admits of  commentatorial treatment which, while heightening the interest of  the student, is calculated to stimulate alike his ambition and his  imagination. That the sister sciences of Botany and Zoology fall  under one discipline, is expressed in the English usage of the term  \"Biology.\" Experience has shown that the best work in either  department has been produced by those who have acquired on  all-round knowledge of at least the elementary stages of both; and,  that the advanced morphologist and physiologist are alike the better  for a familiarity with the principles-- not to say with the progressive  advancement-- of each other's domain, is to-day undeniable. These  and other allied considerations, render it advisable that the  elementary facts of morphology and physiology should be presented  to the beginner side by side-- a principle too frequently neglected in  books which, like this one, are specially written for the biological  neophyte. Although the student is the wiser for the actual  observation of the fact of nature, he becomes the better only when  able to apply them, as for example, by the judicious construction of  elementary generalizations, such as are introduced into the pages of  this work. So long as these generalizations, regarded as first  attempts to deduce \"laws\" in the form of \"generalized statement of  facts based observation,\" are properly introduced into an elementary  text-book, intended for the isolated worker cut off from the lecture  room, their intercalation is both healthy and desirable.    Mr. Wells has kept these precepts constantly in mind in the  preparation of his work, and in the formulation of his plans for its  future extension, thereby enhancing the value of the book itself, and  at the same time, discouraging the system of pure"]]]
