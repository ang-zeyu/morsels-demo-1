The literal meaning is \"big  love\", or \"much love\" or \"great love\". And, like most words in most  languages, it has several meanings. In naming this book, \"Arohanui:  Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand\", \"Arohanui\" is used in its  more expressive meaning, \"enfolding love\", or \"that love which binds a  community together\", or \"that love which creates bonds of mutual trust and  loyalty\", or \"that love which builds and carries forward culture or  civilization\".            Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand    Baha'i publishing trust  Suva, Fiji  Approved for publication by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is  of New Zealand Inc.  (c) 1982 BAHA'I PUBLISHING TRUST SUVA, FIJI ISLANDS                \"You are destined to achieve great things for our beloved Cause      and my constant prayer is that your vision may be clear, your      purpose unshaken, your zeal undiminished, your hopes undimmed. Let      not obstacles and disappointments, which are inevitable,      dishearten you and whenever you are faced with trials recall our      Beloved's innumerable sufferings.\"          From a letter to the first New Zealand Baha'i dated August 12th, 1926.    The letters in this compilation were written by various secretaries of the  Guardian at his specific direction. Spelling and other inconsistencies are  a reflection of the fact that different secretaries were used. Those  passages actually written by the Guardian himself are printed in italics.    The messages are numbered sequentially for the convenience of the reader  and as an aid to indexing. The numbers appear before the date of each  letter.            PART I  LETTERS TO INDIVIDUALS, BEFORE APRIL 21ST, 1926.      These were written prior to the formation of the first Local Spiritual  Assembly in New Zealand.          (1) June 22nd, 1923      My dear Baha'i sister,    Your beautiful letter of April 3rd written to the Beloved Guardian of the  Cause of God, our dear Shoghi Effendi, was received.[+E1] He was much  impressed and charmed with the spirit of your letter, which indicated deep  devotion to and absolute dependence on the Holy Spirit of the Beloved  Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha.    He instructed me with a heart overflowing with love to answer your letter,  conveying to you his high estimation for the beauty of the faith of the  New Zealand friends, and deep appreciation towards the splendid services  of our dear Mr and Mrs Dunn,[+E2] who are so wonderfully blessed and  assisted by the power of the Holy Ghost. He loves you all and prays for  your happiness and spiritual growth.    It is true that your group is now still small, but he assures you that  your group will before long grow larger and larger day by day. It has been  always the case with the growth of every religion. Some pure soul or souls  go to some land and sow the seeds of the heavenly teachings in the hearts  of few who are most pure and so most receptive. The seeds will germinate  and grow in them. The fruits of these seeds appear in the regeneration of  the lives of these primary adherents. These primary adherents share the  bounties they have received with other souls, who through them obtain new  life and light and in turn illumine other people.    The primary adherents are the stars of great magnitude in every land in  the firmament of the Kingdom of God. They are the chosen people. They are  like candles which, through their sacrificial efforts, are weeping their  lives away in order to give light to the world and establish the purpose  of their Lord and Saviour, which purpose is the salvation of mankind. His  Holiness, Jesus Christ! see how small the group of His disciples was! No  matter how few the number of the disciples was, yet they through His power  illumined the world. Our Era is similar to that, but through the  development of humanity it is greater, and through the evils of the  material civilization and negligence of mankind our sacrifices must be  greater. Divine light must make itself manifest in our daily life deeds.    In the early days of the appearance of our Saviour, virtue was to save  ourselves. When we are once established in our faith, then virtue is to  save others. The three mottoes of education hold true in our case too.  First grow, then become and then contribute. We have developed; we have  established ourselves, and now it is time to contribute to others. We have  inexhaustible capital. The candles of our spiritual lives constantly weep  away their lives in shedding light to the world, but they never become  exhausted. For there is connection between our lives and that of  Baha'u'llah and our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha.    It cannot be described how much we long to see our dear New Zealand  brethren and sisters. We hope the day will come when they can come to us  and we to them. Meanwhile, we are praying at the Holy Threshold of our  beloved Master for your success and happiness. We hope you will pray for  us too. The effect of the prayers of the pure hearts is tremendously  great.    Our dear Shoghi Effendi wants you not to look at your own capacity, but at  the power of the Holy Ghost of God. He sends you all his loving greeting  and tender affection.    With warm wishes and Baha'i love, I remain,    Your humble brother in His love,  Azizullah S. Bahadur          (2) May 8th, 1925      Allah-u-abha    Dear Baha'i Sister,    Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to receive this morning your letter of  28th April, but we were very sorry to hear you have been ill and hope your  health will soon be completely restored.[+E"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19252"],[0,"Bahá'í Administration (#1)"],[1,"Baha'i Administration      by Shoghi Effendi          Edition 1, (September 2006)                                       BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.

PART ONE: EXCERPTS FROM THE WILL AND TESTAMENT OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA          \"All-praise to Him Who, by the Shield of His Covenant, hath...\"      All-praise to Him Who, by the Shield of His Covenant, hath guarded the  Temple of His Cause from the darts of doubtfulness, Who by the Hosts of  His Testament hath preserved the Sanctuary of His Most Beneficent Law and  protected His Straight and Luminous Path, staying thereby the onslaught of  the company of Covenant-breakers, that have threatened to subvert His  Divine Edifice; Who hath watched over His Mighty Stronghold and  All-glorious Faith, through the aid of men whom the slander of the  slanderer affects not, whom no earthly calling, glory and power can turn  aside from the Covenant of God and His Testament, established firmly by  His clear and manifest words, writ and revealed by His All-glorious Pen  and recorded in the Preserved Tablet.    Salutation and praise, blessing and glory rest upon that primal branch of  the Divine and Sacred Lote-Tree, grown out, blest, tender, verdant and  flourishing from the Twin Holy Trees; the most wondrous, unique and  priceless pearl that doth gleam from out the twin surging seas; upon the  offshoots of the Tree of Holiness, the twigs of the Celestial Tree, they  that in the Day of the Great Dividing have stood fast and firm in the  Covenant; upon the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God that have diffused  widely the Divine Fragrances, declared His Proofs, proclaimed His Faith,  published abroad His Law, detached themselves from all things but Him,  stood for righteousness in this world, and kindled the Fire of the Love of  God in the very hearts and souls of His servants; upon them that have  believed, rested assured, stood steadfast in His Covenant and followed the  Light that after my passing shineth from the Dayspring of Divine  Guidance--for behold! he is the blest and sacred bough that hath branched  out from the Twin Holy Trees. Well is it with him that seeketh the shelter  of his shade that shadoweth all mankind.          \"O ye beloved of the Lord! The greatest of all things is the...\"      O ye beloved of the Lord! The greatest of all things is the protection of  the True Faith of God, the preservation of His Law, the safeguarding of  His Cause and service unto His Word. Ten thousand souls have shed streams  of their sacred blood in this path, their precious lives they offered in  sacrifice unto Him, hastened wrapt in holy ecstasy unto the glorious field  of martyrdom, upraised the Standard of God's Faith and writ with their  life-blood upon the Tablet of the world the verses of His Divine Unity.  The sacred breast of His Holiness, the Exalted One, (may my life be a  sacrifice unto Him) was made a target to many a dart of woe, and in  Mazandaran, the Blessed feet of the Abha Beauty (may my life be offered up  for His loved ones) were so grievously scourged as to bleed and be sore  wounded. His neck also was put into captive chains and His feet made fast  in the stocks. In every hour, for a period of fifty"]]]
