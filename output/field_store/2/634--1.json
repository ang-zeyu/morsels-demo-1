L. Stevenson       QUEEN TITA'S WAGER,            William Black          THE BIRD ON ITS JOURNEY, By Beatrice Harraden      It was about four in the afternoon when a young girl came into the salon  of the little hotel at C---- in Switzerland, and drew her chair up to  the fire.    \"You are soaked through,\" said an elderly lady, who was herself trying  to get roasted. \"You ought to lose no time in changing your clothes.\"    \"I have not anything to change,\" said the young girl, laughing. \"Oh, I  shall soon be dry!\"    \"Have you lost all your luggage?\" asked the lady, sympathetically.    \"No,\" said the young girl; \"I had none to lose.\" And she smiled a little  mischievously, as though she knew by instinct that her companion's  sympathy would at once degenerate into suspicion!    \"I don't mean to say that I have not a knapsack,\" she added,  considerately. \"I have walked a long distance--in fact, from Z----.\"    \"And where did you leave your companions?\" asked the lady, with a touch  of forgiveness in her voice.    \"I am without companions, just as I am without luggage,\" laughed the  girl.    And then she opened the piano, and struck a few notes. There was  something caressing in the way in which she touched the keys; whoever  she was, she knew how to make sweet music; sad music, too, full of that  undefinable longing, like the holding out of one's arms to one's friends  in the hopeless distance.    The lady bending over the fire looked up at the little girl, and forgot  that she had brought neither friends nor luggage with her. She hesitated  for one moment, and then she took the childish face between her hands  and kissed it.    \"Thank you, dear, for your music,\" she said, gently.    \"The piano is terribly out of tune,\" said the little girl, suddenly; and  she ran out of the room, and came back carrying her knapsack.    \"What are you going to do?\" asked her companion.    \"I am going to tune the piano,\" the little girl said; and she took a  tuning-hammer out of her knapsack, and began her work in real earnest.  She evidently knew what she was about, and pegged away at the notes as  though her whole life depended upon the result.    The lady by the fire was lost in amazement. Who could she be? Without  luggage and without friends, and with a tuning-hammer!    Meanwhile one of the gentlemen had strolled into the salon; but hearing  the sound of tuning, and being in secret possession of nerves, he fled,  saying, \"The tuner, by Jove!\"    A few minutes afterward Miss Blake, whose nerves were no secret  possession, hastened into the salon, and, in her usual imperious  fashion, demanded instant silence.    \"I have just done,\" said the little girl. \"The piano was so terribly out  of tune, I could not resist the temptation.\"    Miss Blake, who never listened to what any one said, took it for granted  that the little girl was the tuner for whom M. le Proprietaire had  promised to send; and having bestowed on her a condescending nod, passed  out into the garden, where she told some of the visitors that the piano  had been tuned at last, and that the tuner was a young woman of rather  eccentric appearance.    \"Really, it is quite abominable how women thrust themselves into every  profession,\" she remarked, in her masculine voice. \"It is so unfeminine,  so unseemly.\"    There was nothing of the feminine about Miss Blake; her horse-cloth  dress, her waistcoat and high collar, and her billycock hat were of the  masculine genus; even her nerves could not be called feminine, since we  learn from two or three doctors (taken off their guard) that nerves are  neither feminine nor masculine, but common.    \"I should like to see this tuner,\" said one of the tennis-players,  leaning against a tree.    \"Here she comes,\" said Miss Blake, as the little girl was seen  sauntering into the garden.    The men put up their eye-glasses, and saw a little lady with a childish  face and soft brown hair, of strictly feminine appearance and bearing.  The goat came toward her and began nibbling at her frock. She seemed  to understand the manner of goats, and played with him to his heart's  content. One of the tennis players, Oswald Everard by name, strolled  down to the bank where she was having her frolic.    \"Good-afternoon,\" he said, raising his cap. \"I hope the goat is not  worrying you. Poor little fellow! this is his last day of play. He is to  be killed to-morrow for _table d'hote_.\"    \"What a shame!\" she said. \"Fancy to be killed, and then grumbled at!\"    \"That is precisely what we do here,\" he said, laughing. \"We grumble at  everything we eat. And I own to being one of the grumpiest; though the  lady in the horse-cloth dress yonder follows close upon my heels.\"    \"She was the lady who was annoyed at me because I tuned the piano,\" the  little girl said. \"Still, it had to be done. It was plainly my duty. I  seemed to have come for that purpose.\"    \"It has been confoundedly annoying having it out of tune,\" he said.  \"I've had to give up singing altogether. But what a strange profession  you have chosen! Very unusual, isn't it?\"    \"Why, surely not,\" she answered, amused. \"It seems to me that every  other woman has taken to it. The wonder to me is that any one ever  scores a success. Nowadays, however, no one could amass a huge fortune  out of it.\"    \"No one, indeed!\" replied Oswald Everard, laughing. \"What on earth made  you take to it?\"    \"It took to me,\" she said simply. \"It wrapped me round with enthusiasm.  I could think of nothing else. I vowed that I would rise to the top of  my profession. I worked day and night. But it means incessant toil for  years if one wants to make any headway.\"    \"Good gracious! I thought it was merely a matter of a few months,\" he  said, smiling at the little girl.    \"A few months!\" she repeated, scornfully. \"You are speaking the language  of an amateur. No; one has to work faithfully year after year; to grasp  the possibilities, and pass on to greater possibilities. You imagine  what it must feel like to touch the notes, and know that you are keeping  the listeners spellbound; that you are taking them into a fairy-land of  sound, where petty personality is lost in vague longing and regret.\"    \"I confess I had not thought of it in that way,\" he said, humbly. \"I  have only regarded it as a necessary every-day evil; and to be quite  honest with you, I fail to see now how it can inspire enthusiasm. I wish  I could see,\" he added, looking up at the engaging little figure before  him.    \"Never mind,\" she said, laughing at his distress; \"I forgive you. And,  after all, you are not the only person who looks upon it as a necessary  evil. My poor old guardian abominated it. He made many sacrifices to  come and listen to me. He knew I liked to see his kind old face, and  that the presence of a real friend inspired me with confidence.\"    \"I should not have thought it was nervous work,\" he said.    \"Try it and see,\" she answered. \"But surely you spoke of singing. Are  you not nervous when you sing?\"    \"Sometimes,\" he replied, rather stiffly. \"But that is slightly  different.\" (He was very proud of his singing, and made a great fuss  about it.) \"Your profession, as I remarked before, is an unavoidable  nuisance. When I think what I have suffered from the gentlemen of  your profession, I only wonder that I have any brains left. But I am  uncourteous.\"    \"No, no,\" she said; \"let me hear about your sufferings.\"    \"Whenever I have specially wanted to be quiet,\" he said--and then he  glanced at her childish little face, and he hesitated. \"It seems so  rude of me,\" he added. He was the soul of courtesy, although he was an  amateur tenor singer.    \"Please tell me,\" the little girl said, in her winning way.    \"Well,\" he said, gathering himself together, \"it is the one subject on  which I can be eloquent. Ever since I can remember, I have been worried  and tortured by those rascals. I have tried in every way to escape from  them, but there is no hope for me. Yes; I believe that all the tuners in  the universe are in league against me, and have marked me out for their  special prey.\"    \"_All the what_?\" asked the little girl, with a jerk in her voice.    \"All the tuners, of course,\" he replied, rather snappishly. \"I know  that we cannot do without them; but good heavens! they have no tact, no  consideration, no mercy. Whenever I've wanted to write or read quietly,  that fatal knock has come at the door, and I've known by instinct that  all chance of peace was over. Whenever I've been giving a luncheon  party, the tuner has arrived, with his abominable black bag, and his  abominable card which has to be signed at once. On one occasion I was  just proposing to a girl in her father's library when the tuner struck  up in the drawing-room. I left off suddenly, and fled from the house.  But there is no escape from these fiends; I believe they are swarming  about in the air like so many bacteria. And how, in the name of  goodness, you should deliberately choose to be one of them, and should  be so enthusiastic over your work, puzzles me beyond all words. Don't  say that you carry a black bag, and present cards which have to be  filled up at the most inconvenient time; don't--\"    He stopped suddenly, for the little girl was convulsed with laughter.  She laughed until the tears rolled down her cheeks, and then she dried  her eyes and laughed again.    \"Excuse me,\" she said; \"I can't help myself; it's so funny.\"    \"It may be funny to you,\" he said, laughing in spite of himself; \"but it  is not funny to me.\"    \"Of course it isn't,\" she replied, making a desperate effort to be  serious. \"Well, tell me something more about these tuners.\"    \"Not another word,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20715"],[0,"Marriage and Love (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net  (This book was produced from scanned images of public  domain material from the Google Print project.)

Like most popular notions this also rests not on actual facts, but on  superstition.    Marriage and love have nothing in common; they are as far apart as the  poles; are, in fact, antagonistic to each other. No doubt some marriages  have been the result of love. Not, however, because love could assert  itself only in marriage; much rather is it because few people can  completely outgrow a convention. There are today large numbers of men  and women to whom marriage is naught but a farce, but who submit to it  for the sake of public opinion. At any rate, while it is true that some  marriages are based on love, and while it is equally true that in some  cases love continues in married life, I maintain that it does so  regardless of marriage, and not because of it.    On the other hand, it is utterly false that love results from marriage.  On rare occasions one does hear of a miraculous case of a married couple  falling in love after marriage, but on close examination it will be  found that it is a mere adjustment to the inevitable. Certainly the  growing-used to each other is far away from the spontaneity, the  intensity, and beauty of love, without which the intimacy of marriage  must prove degrading to both the woman and the man.    Marriage is primarily an economic arrangement, an insurance pact. It  differs from the ordinary life insurance agreement only in that it is  more binding, more exacting. Its returns are insignificantly small  compared with the investments. In taking out an insurance policy one  pays for it in dollars and cents, always at liberty to discontinue  payments. If, however, woman's premium is a husband, she pays for it  with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life, \"until  death doth part.\" Moreover, the marriage insurance condemns her to  life-long dependency, to parasitism, to complete uselessness, individual  as well as social. Man, too, pays his toll, but as his sphere is wider,  marriage does not limit him as much as woman. He feels his chains more  in an economic sense.    Thus Dante's motto over Inferno applies with equal force to marriage.  \"Ye who enter here leave all hope behind.\"    That marriage is a failure none but the very stupid will deny. One has  but to glance over the statistics of divorce to realize how bitter a  failure marriage really is. Nor will the stereotyped Philistine argument  that the laxity of divorce laws and the growing looseness of woman  account for the fact that: first, every twelfth marriage ends in  divorce; second, that since 1870 divorces have increased from 28 to 73  for every hundred thousand population; third, that adultery, since 1867,  as ground for divorce, has increased 270.8 per cent.; fourth, that  desertion increased 369.8 per cent.    Added to these startling figures is a vast amount of material, dramatic  and literary, further elucidating this subject. Robert Herrick, in  _Together_; Pinero, in _Mid-Channel_; Eugene Walter, in _Paid in Full_,  and scores of other writers are discussing the barrenness, the monotony,  the sordidness, the inadequacy of marriage as a factor for harmony and  understanding.    The thoughtful social student will not content himself with the popular  superficial excuse for this phenomenon. He will have to dig down deeper  into the very life of the sexes to know why marriage proves so  disastrous.    Edward Carpenter says that behind every marriage stands the life-long  environment of the two sexes; an environment so different from each  other that man and woman must remain strangers. Separated by an  insurmountable wall of superstition, custom, and habit, marriage has not  the potentiality of developing knowledge of, and respect for, each  other, without which every union is doomed to failure.    Henrik Ibsen, the hater of all social shams, was probably the first to  realize this great truth. Nora leaves her husband, not--as the stupid  critic would have it--because she is tired of her responsibilities or  feels the need of woman's rights, but because she has come to know that  for eight years she had lived with a stranger and borne him children.  Can there be anything more humiliating, more degrading than a life-long  proximity between two strangers? No need for the woman to know anything  of the man, save his income. As to the knowledge of the woman--what is  there to know except that she has a pleasing appearance? We have not yet  outgrown the theologic myth that woman has no soul, that she is a mere  appendix to man, made out of his rib just for the convenience of the  gentleman who was so strong that he was afraid of his own shadow.    Perchance the poor quality of the material whence woman comes is  responsible for her inferiority. At any rate, woman has no soul--what is  there to know about her? Besides, the less soul a woman has the greater  her asset as a wife, the more readily will she absorb herself in her  husband. It is this slavish acquiescence to man's superiority that has  kept the marriage institution seemingly intact for so long a period. Now  that woman is coming into her own, now that she is actually growing  aware of herself as a being outside of the master's grace, the sacred  institution of marriage is gradually being undermined, and no amount of  sentimental lamentation can stay it.    From infancy, almost, the average girl is told that marriage is her  ultimate goal; therefore her training and education must be directed  towards that end. Like the mute beast fattened for slaughter, she is  prepared for that. Yet, strange to say, she is allowed to know much less  about her function as wife and mother than the ordinary artisan of his  trade. It is indecent and filthy for a respectable girl to know anything  of the marital relation. Oh, for the inconsistency of respectability,  that needs the marriage vow to turn something which is filthy into the  purest and most sacred arrangement that none dare question or criticize.  Yet that is exactly the attitude of the average upholder of marriage.  The prospective wife and mother is kept in complete ignorance of her  only asset in the competitive field--sex. Thus she enters into life-long  relations with a man only to find herself shocked, repelled, outraged  beyond measure by the most natural and healthy instinct, sex. It is safe  to say that a large percentage of the unhappiness, misery, distress, and  physical suffering of matrimony is due to the criminal ignorance in sex  matters that is being extolled as a great virtue. Nor is it at all an  exaggeration when I say that more than one home has been broken up  because of this deplorable fact.      If, however, woman is free and big enough to learn the mystery of sex  without the sanction of State or Church, she will stand condemned as  utterly unfit to become the wife of a \"good\" man, his goodness  consisting of an empty brain and plenty of money. Can there be anything  more outrageous than the idea that a healthy, grown woman, full of life  and passion, must deny nature's demand, must subdue her most intense  craving, undermine her health and break her spirit, must stunt her  vision, abstain from the depth and glory of sex experience until a  \"good\" man comes along to take her unto himself as a wife? That is  precisely what marriage means. How can such an arrangement end except in  failure? This is one, though not the least important, factor of  marriage, which differentiates it from love.    Ours is a practical age. The time when Romeo and Juliet risked the wrath  of their fathers for love, when Gretchen exposed herself to the gossip  of her neighbors for love, is no more. If, on rare occasions, young  people allow themselves the luxury of romance, they are taken in care by  the elders, drilled and pounded until they become \"sensible.\"    The moral lesson instilled in the girl is not whether the man has  aroused her love, but rather is it, \"How much?\" The important and only  God of practical American life: Can the man make a living? can he  support a wife? That is the only thing that justifies marriage.  Gradually this saturates every thought of the girl; her dreams are not  of moonlight and kisses, of laughter and tears; she dreams of shopping  tours and bargain counters. This soul poverty and sordidness are the  elements inherent in the marriage institution. The State and the Church  approve of no other ideal, simply because it is the one that  necessitates the State and Church control of men and women.    Doubtless there are people who continue to consider love above dollars  and cents. Particularly is this true of that class whom economic  necessity has forced to become self-supporting. The tremendous change in  woman's position, wrought by that"]]]
