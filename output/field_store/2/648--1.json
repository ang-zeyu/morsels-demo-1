HAW!\"       HE WAS SO SURPRISED HE FORGOT TO CLOSE IT          MOTHER WEST WIND'S CHILDREN      I    DANNY MEADOW MOUSE LEARNS WHY HIS TAIL IS SHORT    Danny Meadow Mouse sat in his doorway and looked down the Lone Little  Path across the Green Meadows.  Way, way over near the Smiling Pool he  could see Old Mother West Wind's Children, the Merry Little Breezes, at  play.  Sammy Jay was sitting on a fence post.  He pretended to be  taking a sun bath, but really he was planning mischief.  You never see  Sammy Jay that he isn't in mischief or planning it.    Reddy Fox had trotted past an hour before in a great hurry.  Up on the  hill Danny Meadow Mouse could just see Jimmy Skunk pulling over every  old stick and stone he could find, no matter whose house it might be,  and excusing himself because he was hungry and was looking for beetles.    Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was playing at hide and seek behind some  fleecy white clouds.  All the birds were singing and singing, and the  world was happy--all but Danny Meadow Mouse.    No, Danny Meadow Mouse was not happy.  Indeed, he was very far from  happy, and all because his tail was short.    By and by up came old Mr. Toad.  It was a warm day and Mr. Toad was  very hot and very, very thirsty.  He stopped to rest beside the house  of Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"Good morning, Danny Meadow Mouse,\" said old Mr. Toad, \"it's a fine  morning.\"    \"Morning,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse, grumpily.    \"I hope your health is good this morning,\" continued old Mr. Toad, just  as if he hadn't noticed how short and cross Danny Meadow Mouse had  answered.    Now old Mr. Toad is very ugly to look upon, but the ugliness is all in  his looks.  He has the sunniest of hearts and always he is looking for  a chance to help someone.    \"Danny Meadow Mouse,\" said old Mr. Toad, \"you make me think of your  grandfather a thousand times removed.  You do indeed.  You look just as  he did when he lost the half of his tail and realized that he never,  never could get it back again.\"    Danny Meadow Mouse sat up suddenly.    \"What are you talking about, old Mr. Toad?  What are you talking  about?\" he asked.  \"Did my grandfather a thousand times removed lose  the half of his tail, and was it shorter then than mine is now?  Was  it, old Mr. Toad?  And how did he come to lose the half of it?\"    Old Mr. Toad laughed a funny silent laugh.  \"It's a long story,\" said  old Mr. Toad, \"and I'm afraid I can't tell it.  Go down to the Smiling  Pool and ask Great-Grandfather Frog, who is my first cousin, how it  happened your grandfather a thousand times removed lost the half of his  tail.  But before you go catch three fat, foolish, green flies and take  them with you as a present to Grandfather Frog.\"    Danny Meadow Mouse could hardly wait for old Mr. Toad to stop speaking.  In fact, he was in such a hurry that he almost forgot his manners.  Not  quite, however, for he shouted \"Thank you, Mr. Toad, thank you!\" over  his shoulder as he rushed off down the Lone Little Path.    You see his short tail had always been a matter of mortification to  Danny Meadow Mouse.  All his cousins in the Mouse family and the Rat  family have long, smooth, tapering tails, and they have always been a  source of envy to Danny Meadow Mouse.  He had felt his queer short tail  to be a sort of disgrace.  So when he would meet one of his cousins  dancing down the Lone Little Path, with his long, slim, tapering tail  behind him, Danny Meadow Mouse would slip out of sight under the long  grass, he was so ashamed of his own little tail.  It looked so mean and  small!  He had wondered and wondered if the Meadow Mice had always had  short tails.  He used to ask everyone who came his way if they had ever  seen a Meadow Mouse with a long tail, but he had never found any one  who had.    \"Perhaps,\" thought Danny Meadow Mouse as he hurried down the Lone  Little Path, \"perhaps Grandfather Frog, who is very wise, will know why  my tail is short.\"    So he hurried this way and he hurried that way over the Green Meadows  in search of fat, foolish, green flies.  And when he had caught three,  he caught one more for good measure.  Then he started for the Smiling  Pool as fast as his short legs would take him.    When finally he reached the edge of the Smiling Pool he was quite out  of breath.  There sat Great-Grandfather Frog on his big, green lily  pad.  He was blinking his great goggle eyes at jolly, round, red Mr.  Sun.    \"Oh, Grandfather Frog,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse in a very small voice,  for you know he was quite out of breath with running, \"Oh, Grandfather  Frog, I've brought you four fat, foolish, green flies.\"    Grandfather Frog put a hand behind an ear and listened.  \"Did I hear  someone say 'foolish, green flies?'\" asked Grandfather Frog.    \"Yes, Grandfather Frog, here they are,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse, still  in a very small voice.  Then he gave Grandfather Frog the four fat,  foolish, green flies.    \"What is it that you want me to do for you, Danny Meadow Mouse?\" asked  Grandfather Frog as he smacked his lips, for he knew that Danny Meadow  Mouse must want something to bring him four fat, foolish, green flies.    \"If you please,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse, very politely, \"if you  please, Grandfather Frog, old Mr. Toad told me that you could tell me  how Grandfather Meadow Mouse a thousand times removed lost half of his  tail.  Will you, Grandfather Frog--will you?\"    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"My cousin, Mr. Toad, talks too  much.\"    But he settled himself comfortably on the big lily pad, and this is  what he told Danny Meadow Mouse:    \"Once upon a time, when the world was young, Mr. Meadow Mouse, your  grandfather a thousand times removed, was a very fine gentleman.  He  took a great deal of pride in his appearance, did Mr. Meadow Mouse, and  they used to say on the Green Meadows that he spent an hour, a full  hour, every day combing his whiskers and brushing his coat.    \"Anyway, he was very fine to look upon, was Mr. Meadow Mouse, and not  the least attractive thing about him was his beautiful, long, slim  tail, of which he was very proud.    \"Now about this time there was a great deal of trouble on the Green  Meadows and in the Green Forest, for some one was stealing--yes,  stealing!  Mr. Rabbit complained first.  To be sure, Mr. Rabbit was  lazy and his cabbage patch had grown little more than weeds while he  had been minding other folks' affairs rather than his own, but, then,  that was no reason why he should lose half of the little which he did  raise.  And that is just what he said had happened.    \"No one really believed what Mr. Rabbit said, for he had such a bad  name for telling things which were not so that when he did tell the  truth no one could be quite sure of it.    \"So no one paid much heed to what Mr. Rabbit said until Happy Jack  Squirrel one day went to his snug little hollow in the big chestnut  tree where he stores his nuts and discovered half had been stolen.  Then Striped Chipmunk lost the greater part of his winter store of  corn.  A fat trout was stolen from Billy Mink.    \"It was a terrible time, for every one suspected every one else, and no  one on the Green Meadows was happy.    \"One evening Mr. Meadow Mouse went for a stroll along the Crooked  Little Path up the hill.  It was dark, very dark indeed.  But just as  he passed Striped Chipmunk's granary, the place where he stores his  supply of corn and acorns for the winter, Mr. Meadow Mouse met his  cousin, Mr. Wharf Rat.  Now Mr. Wharf Rat was very big and strong and  Mr. Meadow Mouse had for a long time looked up to and admired him.    \"'Good evening, Cousin Meadow Mouse,' said Mr. Wharf Rat, swinging a  bag down from his shoulder.  'Will you do a favor for me?'    \"Now Mr. Meadow Mouse felt very much flattered, and as he was a very  obliging fellow anyway, he promptly said he would.    \"'All right,' said Mr. Wharf Rat.  'I'm going to get you to tote this  bag down the Crooked Little Path to the hollow chestnut tree.  I've got  an errand back on top of the hill.'    \"So Mr. Meadow Mouse picked up the bag, which was very heavy, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#1)"],[1,"*       *       *       *       *        +-----------------------------------------------------------+      | Transcriber's Note:                                       |      |                                                           |      | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the original     |      | document have been preserved.                             |      |                                                           |      | The Glossary at the end of the document includes an       |      | explanatory note on special characters and diacritics.    |      |                                                           |      | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in this  |      | text.

Is it not time to  write my life's story? I am just as much out of the way as if I were  dead, for I am absolutely other than the person whose story I have to  tell. Physical continuity with my earlier self is no disadvantage. I  could speak in the third person and not feel that I was masquerading.  I can analyze my subject, I can reveal everything; for _she_, and not  _I_, is my real heroine. My life I have still to live; her life ended  when mine began.    A generation is sometimes a more satisfactory unit for the study of  humanity than a lifetime; and spiritual generations are as easy to  demark as physical ones. Now I am the spiritual offspring of the  marriage within my conscious experience of the Past and the Present.  My second birth was no less a birth because there was no distinct  incarnation. Surely it has happened before that one body served more  than one spiritual organization. Nor am I disowning my father and  mother of the flesh, for they were also partners in the generation of  my second self; copartners with my entire line of ancestors. They gave  me body, so that I have eyes like my father's and hair like my  mother's. The spirit also they gave me, so that I reason like my  father and endure like my mother. But did they set me down in a  sheltered garden, where the sun should warm me, and no winter should  hurt, while they fed me from their hands? No; they early let me run in  the fields--perhaps because I would not be held--and eat of the wild  fruits and drink of the dew. Did they teach me from books, and tell me  what to believe? I soon chose my own books, and built me a world of my  own.    In these discriminations _I_ emerged, a new being, something that had  not been before. And when I discovered my own friends, and ran home  with them to convert my parents to a belief in their excellence, did I  not begin to make my father and mother, as truly as they had ever made  me? Did I not become the parent and they the children, in those  relations of teacher and learner? And so I can say that there has been  more than one birth of myself, and I can regard my earlier self as a  separate being, and make it a subject of study.    A proper autobiography is a death-bed confession. A true man finds so  much work to do that he has no time to contemplate his yesterdays; for  to-day and to-morrow are here, with their impatient tasks. The world  is so busy, too, that it cannot afford to study any man's unfinished  work; for the end may prove it a failure, and the world needs  masterpieces. Still there are circumstances by which a man is  justified in pausing in the middle of his life to contemplate the  years already passed. One who has completed early in life a distinct  task may stop to give an account of it. One who has encountered  unusual adventures under vanishing conditions may pause to describe  them before passing into the stable world. And perhaps he also might  be given an early hearing, who, without having ventured out of the  familiar paths, without having achieved any signal triumph, has lived  his simple life so intensely, so thoughtfully, as to have discovered  in his own experience an interpretation of the universal life.    I am not yet thirty, counting in years, and I am writing my life  history. Under which of the above categories do I find my  justification? I have not accomplished anything, I have not discovered  anything, not even by accident, as Columbus discovered America. My  life has been unusual, but by no means unique. And this is the very  core of the matter. It is because I understand my history, in its  larger outlines, to be typical of many, that I consider it worth  recording. My life is a concrete illustration of a multitude of  statistical facts. Although I have written a genuine personal memoir,  I believe that its chief interest lies in the fact that it is  illustrative of scores of unwritten lives. I am only one of many whose  fate it has been to live a page of modern history. We are the strands  of the cable that binds the Old World to the New. As the ships that  brought us link the shores of Europe and America, so our lives span  the bitter sea of racial differences and misunderstandings. Before we  came, the New World knew not the Old; but since we have begun to come,  the Young World has taken the Old by the hand, and the two are  learning to march side by side, seeking a common destiny.    Perhaps I have taken needless trouble to furnish an excuse for my  autobiography. My age alone, my true age, would be reason enough for  my writing. I began life in the Middle Ages, as I shall prove, and  here am I still, your contemporary in the twentieth century, thrilling  with your latest thought.    Had I no better excuse for writing, I still might be driven to it by  my private needs. It is in one sense a matter of my personal  salvation. I was at a most impressionable age when I was transplanted  to the new soil. I was in that period when even normal children,  undisturbed in their customary environment, begin to explore their own  hearts, and"]]]
