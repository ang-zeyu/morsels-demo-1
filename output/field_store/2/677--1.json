It is thus with facts. They are the frame-work of history, not the  drapery. They are like the cold, hard, dishevelled, damp, and  uncomfortable body under the knife of the demonstrator, not the bright  and bounding boy, clothed in graceful garments and filled to every  tingling capillary with a soul.    We, each of us, the artist and the author, respect facts. We have never,  either of us, said an unkind word regarding facts. But we believe that  they should not be placed before the public exactly as they were born.  We want to see them embellished and beautified. That is why this history  is written.    Certain facts have come into the possession of the artist and author of  this book regarding the history of the Republic down to the present day.  We find, upon looking over the records and documents on file in the  various archives of state and nation, that they are absolutely beyond  question, and it is our object to give these truthfully. These rough and  untidy, but impregnable truths, dressed in the sweet persuasive language  of the author, and fluted, embossed, embroidered, and embellished by the  skilful hand of the artist, are now before you.    History is but the record of the public and official acts of human  beings. It is our object, therefore, to humanize our history and deal  with people past and present; people who ate and possibly drank; people  who were born, flourished, and died; not grave tragedians, posing  perpetually for their photographs.    If we succeed in this way, and administer historical truth in the smooth  capsule of the cartoonist and the commentator, we are content. If not,  we know whose fault it will be, but will not get mad and swear about it.

THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.      It was a beautiful evening at the close of a warm, luscious day in old  Spain. It was such an evening as one would select for trysting purposes.  The honeysuckle gave out the sweet announcement of its arrival on the  summer breeze, and the bulbul sang in the dark vistas of  olive-trees,--sang of his love and his hope, and of the victory he  anticipated in the morrow's bulbul-fight, and the plaudits of the royal  couple who would be there. The pink west paled away to the touch of  twilight, and the soft zenith was sown with stars coming like celestial  fire-flies on the breast of a mighty meadow.    Across the dusk, with bowed head, came a woman. Her air was one of proud  humility. It was the air of royalty in the presence of an overruling  power. It was Isabella. She was on her way to confession. She carried a  large, beautifully-bound volume containing a memorandum of her sins for  the day. Ever and anon she would refer to it, but the twilight had come  on so fast that she could not read it.    [Illustration: ISABELLA AT CONFESSIONAL.]    Reaching the confessional, she kneeled, and, by the aid of her notes,  she told off to the good Father and receptacle of the queen's trifling  sins, Fernando de Talavera, how wicked she had been. When it was over  and the queen had risen to go, Fernando came forth, and with a solemn  obeisance said,--    \"May it please your Majesty, I have to-day received a letter from my  good friend the prior of the Franciscan convent of St. Mary's of Rabida  in Andalusia. With your Majesty's permission, I will read it to you.\"    \"Proceed,\" exclaimed Isabella, gravely, taking a piece of crochet-work  from her apron and seating herself comfortably near the dim light.    \"It is dated the sixth month and tenth day of the month, and reads as  follows:         \"DEAR BROTHER:         \"This letter will be conveyed unto your hands by the bearer hereof.       His name is Christopher Columbus, a native of Genoa, who has been       living on me for two years. But he is a good man, devout and       honest. He is willing to work, but I have nothing to do in his       line. Times, as you know, are dull, and in his own profession       nothing seems to be doing.         \"He is by profession a discoverer. He has been successful in the       work where he has had opportunities, and there has been no       complaint so far on the part of those who have employed him.       Everything he has ever discovered has remained that way, so he is       willing to let his work show for itself.         \"Should you be able to bring this to the notice of her Majesty, who       is tender of heart, I would be most glad; and should her most       gracious Majesty have any discovering to be done, or should she       contemplate a change or desire to substitute another in the place       of the present discoverer, she will do well to consider the       qualifications of my friend.                       \"Very sincerely and fraternally thine,                                                  \"Etc., etc.\"    The queen inquired still further regarding Columbus, and, taking the  letter, asked Talavera to send him to the royal sitting-room at ten  o'clock the following day.    When Columbus arose the next morning he found a note from the royal  confessor, and, without waiting for breakfast, for he had almost  overcome the habit of eating, he reversed his cuffs, and, taking a fresh  handkerchief from his valise and putting it in his pocket so that the  corners would coyly stick out a little, he was soon on his way to the  palace. He carried also a small globe wrapped up in a newspaper.    The interview was encouraging until the matter of money necessary for  the trip was touched upon.

Ben-Hur:  A Tale of the Christ    by Lew Wallace          to THE WIFE OF MY YOUTH who still abides with me          BOOK FIRST          CHAPTER I      The Jebel es Zubleh is a mountain fifty miles and more in length,  and so narrow that its tracery on the map gives it a likeness to  a caterpillar crawling from the south to the north. Standing on  its red-and-white cliffs, and looking off under the path of the  rising sun, one sees only the Desert of Arabia, where the east  winds, so hateful to vinegrowers of Jericho, have kept their  playgrounds since the beginning. Its feet are well covered by  sands tossed from the Euphrates, there to lie, for the mountain  is a wall to the pasture-lands of Moab and Ammon on the west--lands  which else had been of the desert a part.    The Arab has impressed his language upon everything south and  east of Judea, so, in his tongue, the old Jebel is the parent of  numberless wadies which, intersecting the Roman road--now a dim  suggestion of what once it was, a dusty path for Syrian pilgrims  to and from Mecca--run their furrows, deepening as they go, to  pass the torrents of the rainy season into the Jordan, or their  last receptacle, the Dead Sea. Out of one of these wadies--or,  more particularly, out of that one which rises at the extreme end  of the Jebel, and, extending east of north, becomes at length  the bed of the Jabbok River--a traveller passed, going to the  table-lands of the desert. To this person the attention of the  reader is first besought.    Judged by his appearance, he was quite forty-five years old.  His beard, once of the deepest black, flowing broadly over his  breast, was streaked with white. His face was brown as a parched  coffee-berry, and so hidden by a red kufiyeh (as the kerchief of  the head is at this day called by the children of the desert)  as to be but in part visible. Now and then he raised his eyes,  and they were large and dark. He was clad in the flowing garments  so universal in the East; but their style may not be described  more particularly, for he sat under a miniature tent, and rode  a great white dromedary.    It may be doubted if the people of the West ever overcome the impression  made upon them by the first view of a camel equipped and loaded for  the desert. Custom, so fatal to other novelties, affects this feeling  but little. At the end of long journeys with caravans, after years of  residence with the Bedawin, the Western-born, wherever they may be,  will stop and wait the passing of the stately brute. The charm is  not in the figure, which not even love can make beautiful; nor in  the movement, the noiseless stepping, or the broad careen. As is  the kindness of the sea to a ship, so that of the desert to its  creature. It clothes him with all its mysteries; in such manner,  too, that while we are looking at him we are thinking of them:  therein is the wonder. The animal which now came out of the wady  might well have claimed the customary homage. Its color and height;  its breadth of foot; its bulk of body, not fat, but overlaid with  muscle; its long, slender neck, of swanlike curvature; the head,  wide between the eyes, and tapering to a muzzle which a lady's  bracelet might have almost clasped; its motion, step long and elastic,  tread sure and soundless--all certified its Syrian blood, old as the  days of Cyrus, and absolutely priceless. There was the usual bridle,  covering the forehead with scarlet fringe, and garnishing the throat  with pendent brazen chains, each ending with a tinkling silver bell;  but to the bridle there was neither rein for the rider nor strap  for a driver. The furniture perched on the back was an invention  which with any other people than of the East would have made the  inventor renowned. It consisted of two wooden boxes, scarce four  feet in length, balanced so that one hung at each side; the inner  space, softly lined and carpeted, was arranged to allow the master  to sit or lie half reclined; over it all was stretched a green  awning. Broad back and breast straps, and girths, secured with  countless knots and ties, held the device in place. In such manner  the ingenious sons of Cush had contrived to make comfortable the  sunburnt ways of the wilderness, along which lay their duty as  often as their pleasure.    When the dromedary lifted itself out of the last break of the wady,  the traveller had passed the boundary of El Belka, the ancient  Ammon. It was morning-time. Before him was the sun, half curtained  in fleecy mist; before him also spread the desert; not the realm  of drifting sands, which was farther on, but the region where the  herbage began to dwarf; where the surface is strewn with boulders  of granite, and gray and brown stones, interspersed with languishing  acacias and tufts of camel-grass. The oak, bramble, and arbutus  lay behind, as if they had come to a line, looked over into the  well-less waste and crouched with fear.    And now there was an end of path or road. More than ever the camel  seemed insensibly driven; it lengthened and quickened its pace, its  head pointed straight towards the horizon; through the wide nostrils  it drank the wind in great draughts. The litter swayed, and rose  and fell like a boat in the waves. Dried leaves in occasional beds  rustled underfoot. Sometimes a perfume like absinthe sweetened all  the air. Lark and chat and rock-swallow leaped to wing, and white  partridges ran whistling and clucking out of the way. More rarely  a fox or a hyena quickened his gallop, to study the intruders at  a safe distance. Off to the right rose the hills of the Jebel,  the pearl-gray veil resting upon them changing momentarily into  a purple which the sun would make matchless a little later.  Over their highest peaks a vulture sailed on broad wings into  widening circles. But of all these things the tenant under the  green tent saw nothing, or, at least, made no sign of recognition.  His eyes were fixed and dreamy. The going of the man, like that of  the animal, was as one being led.    For two hours the dromedary swung forward, keeping the trot  steadily and the line due east. In that time the traveller never  changed his position, nor looked to the right or left. On the  desert, distance is not measured by miles or leagues, but by the  saat, or hour, and the manzil, or halt: three and a half leagues  fill the former, fifteen or twenty-five the latter; but they are  the rates for the common camel. A carrier of the genuine Syrian  stock can make three leagues easily. At full speed he overtakes  the ordinary winds. As one of the results of the rapid advance,  the face of the landscape underwent a change. The Jebel stretched  along the western horizon, like a pale-blue ribbon. A tell, or hummock  of clay and cemented sand, arose here and there. Now and then basaltic  stones lifted their round crowns, outposts of the mountain against the  forces of the plain; all else, however, was sand, sometimes smooth as  the beaten beach, then heaped in rolling ridges; here chopped waves,  there long swells. So, too, the condition of the atmosphere changed.  The sun, high risen, had drunk his fill of dew and mist, and warmed  the breeze that kissed the wanderer under the awning; far and near  he was tinting the earth with faint milk-whiteness, and shimmering  all the sky.    Two hours more passed without rest or deviation from the course.  Vegetation entirely ceased. The sand, so crusted on the surface  that it broke into rattling flakes at every step, held undisputed  sway. The Jebel was out of view, and there was no landmark visible.  The shadow that before followed had now shifted to the north, and was  keeping even race with the objects which cast it; and as there was  no sign of halting, the conduct of the traveller became each moment  more strange.    No one, be it remembered, seeks the desert for a pleasure-ground.  Life and business traverse it by paths along which the bones of things  dead are strewn as so many blazons. Such are the roads from well to  well, from pasture to pasture. The heart of the most veteran sheik  beats quicker when he finds himself alone in the pathless tracts.  So the man with whom we are dealing could not have been in search  of pleasure; neither was his manner that of a fugitive; not once  did he look behind him. In such situations fear and curiosity are  the most common sensations; he was not moved by them. When men are  lonely, they stoop to any companionship; the dog becomes a comrade,  the horse a friend, and it is no shame to shower them with caresses  and speeches of love. The camel received no such token, not a touch,  not a word.    Exactly at noon the dromedary, of its own will, stopped, and uttered  the cry or moan, peculiarly piteous, by which its kind always protest  against an overload, and sometimes crave attention and rest. The master  thereupon bestirred himself, waking, as it were, from sleep. He threw  the curtains of the houdah up, looked at the sun, surveyed the country  on every side long and carefully, as if to identify an appointed place.  Satisfied with the inspection, he drew a deep breath and nodded,  much as to say, \"At last, at last!\" A moment after, he crossed  his hands upon his breast, bowed his head, and prayed silently.  The pious duty done, he prepared to dismount. From his throat  proceeded the sound heard doubtless by the favorite camels of  Job--Ikh! ikh!--the signal to kneel. Slowly the animal obeyed,  grunting the while. The rider then put his foot upon the slender  neck, and stepped upon the sand.          CHAPTER II      The man as now revealed was of admirable proportions, not so tall  as powerful. Loosening the silken rope which held the kufiyeh on his  head, he brushed the fringed folds back until his face was bare--a  strong face, almost negro in color; yet the low, broad forehead,  aquiline nose, the outer corners of the eyes turned slightly"]]]
