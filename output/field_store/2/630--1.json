The following pages embody a study of Islam during a residence of fifteen  years in India, the greater part of which time I have been in daily  intercourse with Musalmans. I have given in the footnotes the authorities  from which I quote. I was not able to procure in Madras a copy of the  Arabic edition of Ibn Khaldoun's great work, but the French translation by  Baron M. de Slane, to which I so frequently refer, is thoroughly reliable.  The quotations from the Quran are made from Rodwell's translation. The  original has been consulted when necessary.    A few slight and occasional errors in transliteration have occurred, such  as Sulat for Salat, Munkar for Munkir, &c., but in no case is the meaning  affected.    In some words, such as Khalif, Khalifate, and Omar, I have retained the  anglicised form instead of using the more correct terms, Khalifa, Khilafat,  'Umr. The letter Q has been used to distinguish the Kaf-i-Karashat from the  Kaf-i-Tazi.    E. S.

It is necessary to enter into some explanation as regards the contents of  this work. It does not fall in with its plan to enter into an account  either of the life of Muhammad or of the wide and rapid spread of the  system founded by him. The first has been done by able writers in England,  France and Germany. I could add nothing new to this portion of the subject,  nor throw new light upon it. The political growth of Muslim nations has  also been set forth in various ways.    It seems to me that the more important study at this time is that of the  religious system which has grown out of the Prophet's teaching, and of its  effect upon the individual and the community. What the Church in her  missionary enterprise has to deal with, what European Governments in the  political world have to do with is Islam as it is, and as it now influences  those who rule and those who are ruled under it.    I have, therefore, tried to show from authentic sources, and from a  practical knowledge of it, what the Faith of Islam really is, and how it  influences men and nations in the present day. I think that recent Fatvas  delivered by the 'Ulama in Constantinople show how firmly a Muslim State is  bound in the fetters of an unchangeable Law, whilst the present practice of  orthodox Muslims all the world {x} over is a constant carrying out of the  precepts given in the Quran and the Sunnat, and an illustration of the  principles I have shown to belong to Islam. On this subject it is not too  much to say that there is, except amongst Oriental scholars, much  misconception.    Again, much that is written on Islam is written either in ignorant  prejudice, or from an ideal standpoint. To understand it aright, one should  know its literature and live amongst its people. I have tried faithfully to  prove every statement I have made; and if, now and again, I have quoted  European authors, it is only by way of illustration. I rest my case  entirely upon Musalman authorities themselves. Still more, I have  ascertained from living witnesses that the principles I have tried to show  as existing in Islam, are really at work now and are as potent as at any  previous period.    I have thus traced up from the very foundations the rise and development of  the system, seeking wherever possible to link the past with the present. In  order not to interfere with this unity of plan, I have had to leave many  subjects untouched, such as those connected with the civil law, with  slavery, divorce, jihad or religious wars, &c. A good digest of Muhammadan  Law[1] will give all necessary information on these points. The basis of  the Law which determines these questions is what I have described in my  first chapter. Ijtihad, for example, rules quite as effectually in a  question of domestic {xi} economy or political jurisprudence as on points  of dogma. It was not, therefore, necessary for me to go into details on  these points.    When I have drawn any conclusion from data which Muhammadan literature, and  the present practice of Muslims have afforded me, I have striven to give  what seems to me a just and right one. Still, I gladly take this  opportunity of stating that I have found many Muslims better than their  creed, men with whom it is a pleasure to associate, and whom I respect for  many virtues and esteem as friends. I judge the system, not any individual  in it.    In India, there are a number of enlightened Muhammadans, ornaments to  native society, useful servants of the State, men who show a laudable zeal  in all social reforms, so far as is consistent with a reputation for  orthodoxy. Their number is far too few, and they do not, in many cases,  represent orthodox Islam, nor do I believe their counterpart would be found  amongst the 'Ulama of a Muslim State. The fact is that the wave of  scepticism which has passed over Europe has not left the East untouched.  Hindu and Muslim alike have felt its influence, but to judge of either the  one system or the other from the very liberal utterances of a few men who  expound their views before English audiences is to yield oneself up to  delusion on the subject.    Islam in India has also felt the influence of contact with other races and  creeds, though, theologically speaking, the Iman and the Din, the faith and  the practice, are unchanged, and remain as I have {xii} described them in  chapters four and five. If Islam in India has lost some of its original  fierceness, it has also adopted many superstitious practices, such as those  against which the Wahhabis protest. The great mass of the Musalman people  are quite as superstitious, if not more so, than their heathen neighbours.  Still the manliness, the suavity of manner, the deep learning, after an  oriental fashion, of many Indian Musalmans render them a very attractive  people. It is true there is a darker side--much bigotry, pride of race,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net                            THE AMERICAN PRACTICAL BREWER AND TANNER:                            IN WHICH IS EXHIBITED                            THE WHOLE PROCESS OF      Brewing without boiling.
