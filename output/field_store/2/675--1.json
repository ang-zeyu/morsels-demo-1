In the following stories, drawn from the annals of Ohio, I have tried to  possess the reader with a knowledge, in outline at least, of the history  of the State from the earliest times. I cannot suppose that I have done  this with unfailing accuracy in respect to fact, but with regard to the  truth, I am quite sure of my purpose at all times to impart it.    The books which have been of most use to me in writing this are the  histories of Francis Parkman; the various publications of Messrs. Robert  Clarke and Co. in the \"Ohio Valley Series\"; McClung's \"Sketches of  Western Adventure\"; \"Ohio\" (in the American Commonwealths Series) by Ruf  us King; \"History and Civil Government of Ohio,\" by B. A. Hinsdale and  Mary Hinsdale; \"Beginnings of Literary Culture in the Ohio Valley,\"  by W. H. Venable; Theodore Roosevelt's \"Winning of the West\"; Whitelaw  Reid's \"Ohio in the War\"; and above all others, the delightful and  inexhaustible volumes of Henry Howe's \"Historical Collections of Ohio.\"    W.

The first Ohio stories are part of the common story of the wonderful Ice  Age, when a frozen deluge pushed down from the north, and covered a vast  part of the earth's surface with slowly moving glaciers. The traces that  this age left in Ohio are much the same as it left elsewhere, and the  signs that there were people here ten thousand years ago, when the  glaciers began to melt and the land became fit to live in again, are  such as have been found in the glacier drift in many other countries.  Even before the ice came creeping southwestwardly from the region of  Niagara, and passed over two thirds of our state, from Lake Erie to the  Ohio River there were people here of a race older than the hills, as the  hills now are; for the glaciers ground away the hills as they once were,  and made new ones, with new valleys between them, and new channels for  the streams to run where there had never been water courses before.  These earliest Ohioans must have been the same as the Ohioans of the  Ice Age, and when they had fled southward before the glaciers, they must  have followed the retreat of the melting ice back into Ohio again. No  one knows how long they dwelt here along its edges in a climate like  that of Greenland, where the glaciers are now to be seen as they once  were in the region of Cincinnati. But it is believed that these Ice  Folk, as we may call them, were of the race which still roams the Arctic  snows. They seem to have lived as the Eskimos of our day live: they were  hunters and fishers, and in the gravelly banks of the new rivers, which  the glaciers upheaved, the Ice Folk dropped the axes of chipped stone  which are now found there. They left nothing else behind them; but  similar tools or weapons are found in the glacier-built river banks  of Europe, and so it is thought that the race of the earliest Ohio men  lived pretty much all over the world in the Ice Age.    [Illustration: Stone Axes 017L]    One of the learned writers[*] who is surest of them and has told us  most about them, holds that they were for their time and place as worthy  ancestors as any people could have; and we could well believe this  because the Ohio man has, in all ages, been one of the foremost men.         * Professor G. F. Wright.    Our Ice Folk were sturdy, valiant, and cunning enough to cope with the  fierce brute life and the terrible climate of their day, but all they  have left to prove it is the same kind of stone axes that have been  found in the drift of the glaciers, along the water courses in Northern  France and Southern England.    Our Ice Folk must have dressed like their far-descended children, the  Eskimos, in furs and skins, and like them they must have lived upon fish  and the flesh of wild beasts. The least terrible of these beasts would  have been the white bear; the mammoth and mastodon were among the  animals the Ice Folk hunted for game, and slew without bows or arrows,  for there was no wood to make these of. The only weapon the Ice Folk had  was the stone ax which they may have struck into their huge prey when  they came upon it sleeping or followed in the chase till it dropped with  fatigue. Such an ax was dug up out of the glacial terrace, as the bank  of this drift is called, in the valley of the Tuscarawas, in 1889,  perhaps ten thousand years after it was left there. It was wrought from  a piece of black flint, four inches long and two inches wide; at the  larger end it was nearly as thick as it was wide, and it was chipped  to a sharp edge all round. Within the present year another of the  Ice Folk's axes has been found near New London, twenty-two feet under  ground, in the same kind of glacial drift as the first. But it seems to  have been made of a different kind of stone, and to have been so deeply  rotted by the long ages it had been buried that when its outer substance  was scratched away, hardly anything of the hard green rock was left.    After the glaciers were gone, the Ohio climate was still very cold, and  vast lakes stretched over the state, freezing in the long winters,  and thawing in the short summers. One of these spread upward from the  neighborhood of Akron to the east and west of where Cleveland stands;  but by far the largest flooded nearly all that part of Ohio which  the glaciers failed to cover, from beyond where Pittsburg is to where  Cincinnati is. At the last point a mighty ice dam formed every winter  till as the climate grew warmer and the ice thawed more and more, the  waters burst the dam, and poured their tide down the Ohio River to  the Mississippi, while those of the northern lake rushed through the  Cuyahoga to Lake Erie, and both lakes disappeared forever. For the next  four or five thousand years the early Ohio men kept very quiet; but we  need not suppose for that reason that there were none. Our Ice Folk, who  dropped their stone axes in the river banks, may have passed away with  the Ice Age, or they may have remained in Ohio, and begun slowly to take  on some faint likeness of civilization. There is nothing to prove that  they went, and there is nothing to prove that they staid; but Ohio must  always have been a pleasant place to live in after the great thaw, and  it seems reasonable to think that the Ice Folk lingered, in part at  least, and changed with the changing climate, and became at last the  people who left the signs of their presence in almost every part of the  state.    Those were the Mound Builders, whose works are said to be two or three  thousand years old, though we cannot be very sure of that. There are  some who think that the mounds are only a few hundred years old, and  that their builders were the race of red men whom the white men found  here. One may think very much as one likes, and I like to think that the  Mound Builders were a very ancient people, who vanished many ages before  the Indians came here. They could not have been savages, for the region  where they dwelt could not have fed savages enough to heap up the  multitude of their mounds. Each wild man needs fifty thousand acres to  live upon, as the wild man lives by hunting and fishing; in the whole  Ohio country, the earliest white adventurers found only two or three  thousand Indians at the most; and the people who built those forts and  temples and tombs, and shaped from the earth the mighty images of their  strange bird-gods and reptile-gods, could have lived only by tilling  the soil. Their mounds are found everywhere in the west between the  Alleghany Mountains and the Mississippi River, but they are found mostly  in Ohio, where their farms and gardens once bordered the Muskingum, the  Scioto, the two Miamis, and our other large streams, which they probably  used as highways to the rivers of the southwest.    Their forts were earthworks, but they were skillfully planned, with a  knowledge which no savage race has shown. They were real strongholds,  and they are so large that some of them inclose hundreds of acres within  walls of earth which still rise ten and twelve feet from the ground.  They are on a far grander scale than the supposed temples or religious  works; and there are more of them than of all the other ruins, except  the small detached mounds, which are almost numberless.    These, from the charred bones found among the ashes in them, are known  to be tombs, and they were probably the sepulchers of the common people,  whose bodies were burned. The large mounds are heaped above walled  chambers, and in these were platforms, supposed to have been altars, and  whole skeletons, supposed to be the skeletons of priests buried there.  The priests are supposed to have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],[0,"Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#1)"],[1,"African Travellers, from Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley, by  W.H.G. Kingston.    ________________________________________________________________________    At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the coastal parts of Africa  were of course well-known, and in any of the territories round the  coasts there were European officials, such as consuls, and European  traders.  This becomes very apparent as you read this book, as many of  the travels described involve sorties from an existing European base.    On the other hand the very sources of the various major rivers were not  on the map, and the object of many of the travellers was to find these  sources, for instance that of the Nile, or rather, that of any one of  its major components, such as the Red Nile and the Blue Nile.    On the whole the various regions they passed through had already a  settled African regime.  In most cases this regime was friendly, but in  some cases the opposite was the case.  These explorations and travels  could only take place if the native rulers could be brought to give  assistance, and in most cases this was forthcoming.  On the other hand  some of the lesser-known early travellers were murdered, and the goods  they travelled with, stolen.  It is really only those travellers who  were able to complete their self-imposed tasks, and return to Britain,  that have become famous.    Written in an easy style, this book is a good read, and very worth the  while of even today's teenagers.  There are too many names to make an  audiobook very easily, so we have not done so, and have no comments on  that.    ________________________________________________________________________    GREAT AFRICAN TRAVELLERS, FROM MUNGO PARK TO LIVINGSTONE AND STANLEY, BY  W.H.G. KINGSTON.    FROM MUNGO PARK TO LIVINGSTONE AND STANLEY.        CHAPTER ONE.    INTRODUCTORY.    INTRODUCTION--THE AFRICAN ASSOCIATION--LEDYARD--LUCAS--FIRST INFORMATION  RESPECTING THE NIGER, OR QUORRA, AND THE GAMBIA--TIMBUCTOO HEARD OF--  THOMPSON AND JOBSON'S VOYAGE UP THE GAMBIA--MAJOR HAUGHTON'S EXPEDITION  AND DEATH.    When the fathers of the present generation were young men, and George  the Third ruled the land, they imagined that the whole interior of  Africa was one howling wilderness of burning sand, roamed over by brown  tribes in the north and south, and by black tribes--if human beings  there were--on either side of the equator, and along the west coast.    The maps then existing afforded them no information.  Of the Mountains  of the Moon they knew about as much as of the mountains in the moon.  The Nile was not explored--its sources unknown--the course of the Niger  was a mystery.  They were aware that the elephant, rhinoceros,  cameleopard, zebra, lion and many other strange beasts ranged over its  sandy deserts; but very little more about them than the fact of their  existence was known.  They knew that on the north coast dwelt the  descendants of the Greek and Roman colonists, and of their Arab  conquerors--that there were such places as Tangiers, Tripoli, Tunis,  Algiers with its piratical cruisers who carried off white men into  slavery; Morocco, with an emperor addicted to cutting off heads; Salee,  which sent forth its rovers far over the ocean to plunder merchantmen;  and a few other towns and forts, for the possession of which Europeans  had occasionally knocked their heads together.    From the west coast they had heard that ivory and gold-dust was to be  procured, as well as an abundant supply of negroes, whose happy lot it  was to be carried off to cultivate the plantations of the West Indies  and America; but, except that they worshipped fetishes, of their manners  and customs, or at what distance from the coast they came, their  ignorance was profound.  They possibly were acquainted with the fact  that the Portuguese had settlements at Loango, Angola, and Benguela; and  that Hottentots and Kaffirs were to be found at the Cape, where a colony  had been taken from the Dutch, but with that colony, except in the  immediate neighbourhood of Cape Town, where ships to and from India  touched, they were but slightly acquainted.    Eastward, if they troubled their heads about the matter, they had a  notion that there was a terribly wild coast, inhabited by fierce  savages, and northward, inside the big island of Madagascar, that the  Portuguese had some settlements for slaving purposes; that further north  again was Zanzibar, and that the mainland was without a town or spot  where civilised man was to be found, till the Strait of Bab el Mandeb,  at the mouth of the Red Sea, was reached.  That there, towards the  interior, was the wonderful country of Abyssinia, in which the Queen of  Sheba once ruled, and Nubia, the birthplace from time immemorial of  black slaves, and that, flowing northward, the mysterious Nile made its  way down numerous cataracts, fertilising the land of Egypt on its annual  overflows, till, passing the great city of Cairo, it entered the  Mediterranean by its numberless mouths.    About Egypt, to be sure, more was known than of all the rest of the  continent together--that there were pyramids and ruined cities, colossal  statues, temples and tombs, crocodiles and hippopotami in the waters of  the sacred river, and Christian Copts and dark-skinned Mahommedans  dwelling on its banks.  But few had explored the mighty remains of its  past glory, or made their way either to the summits or into the  interiors of its mountain-like edifices.    Those who had read Herodotus believed in a good many wonders which that  not incredulous historian narrates.  The late discoveries of  Livingstone, however, prove that Herodotus had obtained a more correct  account of the sources of the Nile than has hitherto been supposed.  Indeed, free range was allowed to the wildest imagination, and the most  extravagant stories found ready believers, there being no one with  authority to contradict them.    When, however, Bruce and other travellers made their way further than  any civilised man had before penetrated into the interior of the  continent, their accounts were discredited, and people were disappointed  when they were told that many of their cherished notions had no  foundation in truth; in fact, up to the commencement of the present  century the greater part of Africa was a _terra incognita_, and only by  slow and painful degrees, and during a comparatively late period, has a  knowledge of some of its more important geographical features been  obtained.    We will now set forth and accompany in succession the most noted of the  various travellers who, pushing their way into that long unknown  interior, bravely encountering its savage and treacherous tribes, its  fever-giving climate, famine, hardships, dangers and difficulties of  every description, have contributed to fill up some of the numerous  blank places on the map.  Although, by their showing, sand enough and to  spare and vast rocky deserts are to be found, there are wide districts  of the greatest fertility, possessed of many natural beauties--elevated  and cool regions, where even the European can retain his health and  strength and enjoy existence; lofty mountains, magnificent rivers and  broad lakes, and many curious and interesting objects, not more  wonderful, however, than those of other parts of the globe, while the  inhabitants in _every_ direction, though often savage and debased,  differ in no material degree from the other descendants of Ham.    Although our fathers knew very little about Africa, their interest had  been excited by the wonders it was supposed to contain, and they were  anxious to obtain all possible information respecting it.  This was,  however, no easy matter, as most of the travellers who endeavoured to  make their way into the interior had died in the attempt.    A society called the African Association, to which the Marquis of  Hastings and Sir John Banks belonged, was at length formed to open up  the mighty continent to British commerce and civilisation.    The first explorer they despatched was Ledyard, who as a sergeant of  marines had sailed round the world with Captain Cook, and after living  among the American Indians had pushed his way to the remotest parts of  Asiatic Russia.  If any man could succeed, it was thought he would.    He proceeded to Egypt, intending to make his way to Sennaar, and thence  to traverse the entire breadth of the African continent; but, seized  with an illness at Cairo, he died just as he was about to start with a  caravan.    The next traveller engaged by the society was Mr Lucas, who, having  been captured by a Salee rover, had been several years a slave in  Morocco.  He started from Tripoli, but was compelled by the disturbed  state of the country to the south of that place to put back.    It should have been said that it had been long known that two mighty  rivers flowed through the interior of Africa, one called the Gambia and  the other the Niger, or Quorra; but whereabouts they rose, or the  direction they took, or the nature of the country they traversed in  their course, no exact information was possessed.    From Arab traders, also, accounts had been received of a vast city,  situated near the banks of the Niger, far away across the desert, called  Timbuctoo, said to possess palaces, temples and numberless public  buildings, to be surrounded by lofty walls and glittering everywhere  with gold and precious stones, to rival the ancient cities of Mexico and  Peru in splendour and those of Asia in the amount of its population.    A century and a half before, two sea captains, Thompson and Jobson, sent  out by a company for the purpose, had made their way some distance up  the Gambia in boats, and early in the eighteenth century Captain Stibbs  had gallantly sailed up the same river to a considerable distance, but,  his native crew refusing to proceed, he was compelled to return without  having gained"]]]
