Two weeks later she had there a great patch of purple  violets. And all Old Trail Town, which takes account of its neighbours'  flowers, of the migratory birds, of eclipses, and the like, came to see  the wonder.    \"Mary Chavah!\" said most of the village, \"you're the luckiest woman  alive. If a miracle was bound to happen, it'd get itself happened to  you.\"    \"I don't believe in miracles, though,\" Mary wrote to Jenny Wing. \"These  come just natural--only we don't know how.\"    \"That _is_ miracles,\" Jenny wrote back. \"They do come natural--we don't  know how.\"    \"At this rate,\" said Ellen Bourne, one of Mary's neighbours, \"you'll be  having roses bloom in your yard about Christmas time. For a Christmas  present.\"    \"I don't believe in Christmas,\" Mary said. \"I thought you knew that. But  I'll take the roses, though, if they come in the Winter,\" she added,  with her queer flash of smile.    When it was dusk, or early in the morning, Mary Chavah, with her long  shawl over her head, stooped beside the violets and loosened the earth  about them with her whole hand, and as if she reverenced violets more  than finger tips. And she thought:--    \"Ain't it just as if Spring was right over back of the air all the  time--and it could come if we knew how to call it? But we don't know.\"    But whatever she thought about it, Mary kept in her heart. For it was as  if not only Spring, but new life, or some other holy thing were nearer  than one thought and had spoken to her, there on the edge of Winter.    And Old Trail Town asked itself:--    \"Ain't Mary Chavah the funniest? Look how nice she is about  everything--and yet you know she won't never keep Christmas at all. No,  sir. She ain't kept a single Christmas in years. I donno why....\"          II      Moving about on his little lawn in the dark, Ebenezer Rule was aware of  two deeper shadows before him. They were between him and the leafless  lilacs and mulberries that lined the street wall. A moment before he had  been looking at that darkness and remembering how, once, as a little  boy, he had slept there under the wall and had dreamed that he had a  kingdom.    \"Who is't?\" he asked sharply.    \"Hello, Ebenezer,\" said Simeon Buck, \"it's only me and Abel. We're all.\"    Ebenezer Rule came toward them. It was so dark that they could barely  distinguish each other. Their voices had to do it all.    \"What you doing out here?\" one of the deeper shadows demanded.    \"Oh, nothing,\" said Ebenezer, irritably, \"not a thing.\"    He did not ask them to go in the house, and the three stood there  awkwardly, handling the time like a blunt instrument. Then Simeon Buck,  proprietor of the Simeon Buck North American Dry Goods Exchange, plunged  into what they had come to say.    \"Ebenezer,\" he said, with those variations of intonation which mean an  effort to be delicate, \"is--is there any likelihood that the factory  will open up this Fall?\"    \"No, there ain't,\" Ebenezer said, like something shutting.    \"Nor--nor this Winter?\" Simeon pursued.    \"No, sir,\" said Ebenezer, like something opening again to shut with a  bang.    \"Well, if you're sure--\" said Simeon.    Ebenezer cut him short. \"I'm dead sure,\" he said. \"I've turned over my  orders to my brother's house in the City. He can handle 'em all and not  have to pay his men a cent more wages.\" And this was as if something had  been locked.    \"Well,\" said Simeon, \"then, Abel, I move we go ahead.\"    Abel Ames, proprietor of the Granger County Merchandise Emporium (\"The  A. T. Stewart's of the Middle West,\" he advertised it), sighed  heavily--a vast, triple sigh, that seemed to sigh both in and out, as a  schoolboy whistles.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I hate to do it. But I'll be billblowed if I want to  think of paying for a third or so of this town's Christmas presents and  carrying 'em right through the Winter. I done that last year, and Fourth  of July I had all I could do to keep from wishing most of the crowd  Merry Christmas, 'count of their still owing me. I'm a merchant and a  citizen, but I ain't no patent adjustable Christmas tree.\"    \"Me neither,\" Simeon said. \"Last year it was _me_ give a silk cloak and  a Five Dollar umbrella and a fur bore and a bushel of knick-knicks to  the folks in this town. My name wa'n't on the cards, but it's me that's  paid for 'em--_up_ to now. I'm sick of it. The storekeepers of this town  may make a good thing out of Christmas, but they'd ought to get some of  the credit instead of giving it all, by Josh.\"    \"What you going to do?\" inquired Ebenezer, dryly.    \"Well, of course last year was an exceptional year,\" said Abel,  \"owing--\"    He hesitated to say \"owing to the failure of the Ebenezer Rule Factory  Company,\" and so stammered with the utmost delicacy, and skipped a  measure.    \"And we thought,\" Simeon finished, \"that if the factory wasn't going to  open up this Winter, we'd work things so's to have little or no  Christmas in town this year--being so much of the present giving falls  on us to carry on our books.\"    \"It ain't only the factory wages, of course,\" Abel interposed, \"it's the  folks's savings being et up in--\"    \"--the failure,\" he would have added, but skipped a mere beat instead.    \"--and we want to try to give 'em a chance to pay us up for last  Christmas before they come on to themselves with another celebration,\"  he added reasonably.    Ebenezer Rule laughed--a descending scale of laughter that seemed to  have no organs wherewith to function in the open, and so never got  beyond the gutturals.    \"How you going to fix it?\" he inquired again.    \"Why,\" said Simeon, \"everybody in town's talking that they ain't going  to give anybody anything for Christmas. Some means it and some don't.  Some'll do it and some'll back out. But the churches has decided to omit  Christmas exercises altogether this year. Some thought to have speaking  pieces, but everybody concluded if they had exercises without oranges  and candy the children'd go home disappointed, so they've left the whole  thing slide--\"    \"It don't seem just right for 'em not to celebrate the birth of our Lord  just because they can't afford the candy,\" Abel Ames observed mildly,  but Simeon hurried on:--    \"--slide, and my idea and Abel's is to get the town meeting to vote a  petition to the same effect asking the town not to try to do anything  with their Christmas this year. We heard the factory wasn't going to  open, and we thought if we could tell 'em that for sure, it would settle  it--and save him and me and all the rest of 'em. Would--would you be  willing for us to tell the town meeting that? It's to-night--we're on  the way there.\"    \"Sure,\" said Ebenezer Rule, \"tell 'em. And you might point out to 'em,\"  he added, with his spasm of gutturals, \"that failures is often salutary  measures. Public benefactions. Fixes folks so's they can't spend their  money fool.\"    He walked with them across the lawn, going between them and guiding them  among the empty aster beds.    \"They think I et up their savings in the failure,\" he went on, \"when all  I done is to bring 'em face to face with the fact that for years they've  been overspending themselves. It takes Christmas to show that up. This  whole Christmas business is about wore out, anyhow. Ain't it?\"    \"That's what,\" Simeon said, \"it's a spendin' sham, from edge to edge.\"    Abel Ames was silent. The three skirted the flower beds and came out on  the level sweep of turf before the house that was no house in the  darkness, save that they remembered how it looked: a square, smoked  thing, with a beard of dead creepers and white shades lidded over its  never-lighted windows--a fit home for this man least-liked of the three  hundred neighbours who made Old Trail Town. He touched the elbows of the  other two men as they walked in the dark, but he rarely touched any  human being.

How Turkey Went to War    By Ottoman Authorities      _Immediately on receiving official notification of the rupture of  diplomatic relations between Austria and Servia, the Turkish Grand  Vizier hastened to inform the Diplomatic Corps in Constantinople that  Turkey would remain neutral in the conflict. Explaining this official  Turkish declaration, the following editorial article appeared early in  August in the Ministerial paper, Tasfiri-Efkiar, published in  Constantinople:_    The declarations made by the Grand Vizier to the Ambassadors of the  powers, in order to reassure them as to the dispositions of Turkey, do  not constitute from a legal point of view a declaration of neutrality,  according to the stipulations of The Hague Conventions; likewise the  Austrian ultimatum to Servia, viewed in the same light, is not  tantamount to a declaration of war. In fact, The Hague Conventions  demand a formal declaration in both cases. But if the formal  declaration of Turkish neutrality cannot be made before she has  received an official notification of the existing war, it is  nevertheless true that the head of the Government, in his  conversations with the Ambassadors, has given them to understand what  the opinion of the people is here. And even without this, the efforts  of the Turkish Government, the desire, and the policy of Turkey, are  so explicit that there is no ground for doubt as to the significance  of the declarations of the Grand Vizier.    Turkey has never asked for war, as she always has worked toward  avoiding it. But we must not misunderstand the meaning of certain  terms. Neutrality does not mean indifference. The present  Austro-Servian conflict is to a supreme degree interesting to us. In  the first place, one of our erstwhile opponents is fighting against a  much stronger enemy. In the natural course of things Servia, which  till lately was expressing, in a rather open way, her solidarity as a  nation, still provoking us, and Greece will be materially weakened. In  the second place, the results of this war may surpass the limits of a  conflict between two countries, and in that case our interests will be  just as materially affected.    We must therefore keep our eyes open, as the circumstances are  momentarily changing, and do not permit us to let escape certain  advantages which we can secure by an active and rightly acting  diplomacy.    The policy of neutrality will impose on us the obligation of avoiding  to side with either of the belligerents, but the same policy will  force us to take all the necessary measures for safeguarding our  interests and our frontiers. If it be true, as reported, that the  pacificist tendencies of Turkey constitute one of the safest  guarantees of peace in the Balkans, then we must hope that on the day  when a general settlement of accounts will be made Europe will be  willing to recognize the important part played by Turkey in the  preservation of peace in the Near East, and will be eager to rectify,  if not all, at least one part of the wrongs she has caused to our  country.      TURKEY LEARNS OF THE WAR.    _Turkish mobilization was still at its first stages when the European  war began on Aug. 1, 1914. The Turkish Government in particular and  the Turkish population in general were overwhelmed by the unexpected  turn of European events, and it was at the height of the crisis that  Turkey received the news of her two battleships building in British  yards being taken over by England. A correspondent of The Daily  Atlantis of New York, writing in Constantinople on Aug. 10, said:_    The European war makes the Turks think that this is their golden  opportunity for turkifying the empire from the one end to the other.  All non-Moslems, mere boys and young men of 25 to 30 years of age and  grown men up to 45, are being arrested by the police and secret  service force, and dragged to the barracks, like convicts, and if they  fail to pay the fifty or eighty pounds Turkish ($230 or $350) for  exemption from military service, they are forced to work as  \"assistant-soldiers.\"    The soldiers thus designated are not given rifles, nor are they  trained for service, but are simply employed as servants to the  regular soldiers. It is easy to understand that no one can endure such  conditions of military life, the result being that each and every one  of these non-Moslems sells whatever property he has in order to pay  the ransom and get away from the army, and from Turkey as well. In ten  days, since this peculiar recruiting began, fully ten thousand Greeks  found a way of escaping from Constantinople, many of them finding a  refuge in the free and hospitable United States. This getting away is  not so easy, writes the same correspondent, because officials of the  various ports are exacting heavy sums from the fugitives before  letting them go. Graft and extortion in this case reign supreme, and  it costs anywhere from three to fifteen pounds ($13 to $70) to \"buy\" a  police or port official. This process, originating in Constantinople,  is widespread in the provinces, and the sums paid in this way by the  non-Moslems to escape military service amount to millions. \"Let the  infidels pay!\" say the Turkish officials. \"They have taken our ships,  and they have to pay for it.\"    The popular feeling against England in these first days of the  European war is fierce. Numerous manifestations, in which the younger  element was largely represented, proceeded to attack the British  stores and British subjects, and there have been serious attempts  against the British Embassy in Constantinople and the British  Consulate at Smyrna.    [Illustration: H.R.H. PRINCESS MARIE JOSE    Only Daughter of the King of the Belgians.    (_Photo from Underwood & Underwood._)]    [Illustration: HIS EMINENCE, CARDINAL MERCIER    Archbishop of Mechlin, Primate of Belgium.]      CONSTANTINOPLE IN AUGUST.    _Another letter from the same source, dated Constantinople, Aug. 6,  gives the following picture of the Turkish capital in the early  days of the European war:_    It is impossible to describe the way in which the Porte is trying to  put the country on a war footing, notwithstanding the terrible odds  she has to fight against. God only knows what the Turks are expecting  if the Austro-Servian conflict turns out according to their desires,  or if the European conflict takes the form of a decisive Austro-German  victory. We now have ample proof to show that the Turkish mobilization  is in such a way conducted as to be ready to act in common with  Bulgaria, in a simultaneous attack against Greek and Servian  Macedonia, as soon as the Austrians have a first decisive victory over  the Servians. This scheme, however, seems to be doomed since the entry  of Great Britain into the general war, and there are indications that  Turkey, warned by England and Russia, will disband her already  mobilized army. On the other hand, the news reaches Constantinople  that the Russian forces have crossed the frontier into Turkish  Armenia, and occupied Erzeroum, while Enver Pasha was seen yesterday,  (Aug. 5,) paying hasty visits to the Russian and British Embassies.  While such is the political situation, matters are still worse in the  business world of the Turkish capital. It is almost impossible to give  an idea of the general upheaval brought about by greedy speculators,  who are taking advantage of this anomalous situation, and by the  Government itself, requisitioning everything they can lay their hands  on, regardless of reason or necessity.    Policemen and Sheriffs, followed by military officers, are taking by  force everything in the way of foodstuffs, entering the bakeries and  other shops selling victuals, boarding ships with cargoes of flour,  potatoes, wheat, rice, &c., and taking over virtually everything,  giving in lieu of payment a receipt which is not worth even the paper  on which it is written.    In this way many shops are forced to close, bread has entirely  disappeared from the bakeries, and Constantinople, the capital of a  neutral country, is already feeling all the troubles and privations  of a besieged city. Prices for foodstuffs have soared to inaccessible  heights as provisions are becoming scarce. Actual hand-to-hand combats  are taking place in the streets outside the bakeries for the  possession of a loaf of bread, and hungry women with children in their  arms are seen crying and weeping in despair.    Many merchants, afraid lest the Government requisition their goods,  hastened to have their orders canceled, the result being that no  merchandise of any kind is coming to Constantinople either from Europe  or from Anatolia.    Both on account of the recruiting of their employes and of shortage of  coal the companies operating the electric tramways of the city have  reduced their service to the minimum, as no power is available for the  running of the cars.    Heartrending scenes are witnessed in front of the closed doors of the  various banking establishments, where large posters are to be seen,  bearing the inscription: _Closed temporarily, by order of the  Government._ The most popular of these institutions is the Wiener  Bankverein. This bank, by making special inducements to small  depositors and by paying a higher interest than the others, succeeded  in concentrating the savings of many"]]]
