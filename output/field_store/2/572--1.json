A preface is usually an excrescence on a good book, and a vain apology  for a worthless one; but, in the present instance, a few explanatory  words seem necessary.    This is meant to be the best collection attainable of that delight of  all children, and of many grown people who retain the child-heart  still--the old-fashioned, time-honored classic Fairy-tale. It has been  compiled from all sources--far-off and familiar; when familiar, the  stories have been traced with care to their original form, which, if  foreign, has been retranslated, condensed, and in any other needful  way made suitable for modern British children. Perrault, Madame  d'Aulnois, and Grimm have thus been laid under contribution. Where it  was not possible to get at the original of a tale, its various  versions have been collated, compared, and combined; and in some  instances, when this proved still unsatisfactory, the whole story has  been written afresh. The few English fairy tales extant, such as _Jack  the Giant Killer, Tom Thumb_, etc., whose authorship is lost in  obscurity, but whose charming Saxon simplicity of style, and intense  realism of narration, make for them an ever-green immortality--these  have been left intact, for no later touch would improve them. All  modern stories have been excluded.    Of course, in fairy tales, instruction is not expected; we find in  them only the rude moral of virtue rewarded and vice punished. But  children will soon discover for themselves that in real life all  beautiful people are not good, nor all ugly ones wicked; that every  elder sister is not ungenerous, nor every stepmother cruel. And the  tender baby-heart is often reached quite as soon by the fancy as by  the reason. Nevertheless, without any direct appeal to conscience or  morality, the Editor of this collection has been especially careful  that there should be nothing in it which could really harm a child.    She trusts that, whatever its defects, the Fairy Book will not deserve  one criticism, almost the sharpest that can be given to any  work--\"that it would have been better if the author had taken more  pains.\"           *       *       *       *       *          CONTENTS.

Once there was a royal couple who grieved excessively because they had  no children. When at last, after long waiting, the queen presented her  husband with a little daughter, his majesty showed his joy by giving a  christening feast, so grand that the like of it was never known. He  invited all the fairies in the land--there were seven altogether--to  stand godmothers to the little princess; hoping that each might bestow  on her some good gift, as was the custom of good fairies in those  days.    After the ceremony, all the guests returned to the palace, where there  was set before each fairy-godmother a magnificent covered dish, with  an embroidered table-napkin, and a knife and fork of pure gold,  studded with diamonds and rubies. But alas! as they placed themselves  at table, there entered an old fairy who had never been invited,  because more than fifty years since she had left the king's dominion  on a tour of pleasure, and had not been heard of until this day. His  majesty, much troubled, desired a cover to be placed for her, but it  was of common delf, for he had ordered from his jeweller only seven  gold dishes for the seven fairies aforesaid. The elderly fairy thought  herself neglected, and muttered angry menaces, which were overheard by  one of the younger fairies, who chanced to sit beside her. This good  godmother, afraid of harm to the pretty baby, hastened to hide herself  behind the tapestry in the hall. She did this, because she wished all  the others to speak first--so that if any ill gift were bestowed on  the child, she might be able to counteract it.    The six now offered their good wishes--which, unlike most wishes, were  sure to come true. The fortunate little princess was to grow up the  fairest woman in the world; to have a temper sweet as an angel; to be  perfectly graceful and gracious; to sing like a nightingale; to dance  like a leaf on a tree; and to possess every accomplishment under the  sun. Then the old fairy's turn came. Shaking her head spitefully, she  uttered the wish that when the baby grew up into a young lady, and  learned to spin, she might prick her finger with the spindle and die  of the wound.    At this terrible prophecy all the guests shuddered; and some of the  more tender-hearted began to weep. The lately happy parents were  almost out of their wits with grief. Upon which the wise young fairy  appeared from behind the tapestry, saying cheerfully \"Your majesties  may comfort yourselves; the princess shall not die. I have no power  to alter the ill-fortune just wished her by my ancient sister--her  finger must be pierced; and she shall then sink, not into the sleep of  death, but into a sleep that will last a hundred years. After that  time is ended, the son of a king will find her, awaken her, and marry  her.\"    Immediately all the fairies vanished.    The king, in the hope of avoiding his daughter's doom, issued an  edict, forbidding all persons to spin, and even to have  spinning-wheels in their houses, on pain of instant death. But it was  in vain. One day, when she was just fifteen years of age, the king and  queen left their daughter alone in one of their castles, when,  wandering about at her will, she came to an ancient donjon tower,  climbed to the top of it, and there found a very old woman--so old and  deaf that she had never heard of the king's edict--busy with her  wheel.    \"What are you doing, good old woman?\" said the princess.    \"I'm spinning, my pretty child.\"    \"Ah, how charming! Let me try if I can spin also.\"    She had no sooner taken up the spindle than, being lively and  obstinate, she handled it so awkwardly and carelessly that the point  pierced her finger. Though it was so small a wound, she fainted away  at once, and dropped silently down on the floor. The poor frightened  old woman called for help; shortly came the ladies in waiting, who  tried every means to restore their young mistress, but all their care  was useless. She lay, beautiful as an angel, the colour still  lingering in her lips and cheeks; her fair bosom softly stirred with  her breath: only her eyes were fast closed. When the king her father  and the queen her mother beheld her thus, they knew regret was  idle--all had happened as the cruel fairy meant. But they also knew  that their daughter would not sleep for ever, though after one hundred  years it was not likely they would either of them behold her  awakening. Until that happy hour should arrive, they determined to  leave her in repose. They sent away all the physicians and attendants,  and themselves sorrowfully laid her upon a bed of embroidery, in the  most elegant apartment of the palace. There she slept and looked like  a sleeping angel still.    When this misfortune happened, the kindly young fairy who had saved  the princess by changing her sleep of death into this sleep of a  hundred years, was twelve thousand leagues away in the kingdom of  Mataquin. But being informed of everything, she arrived speedily, in a  chariot of fire drawn by dragons. The king was somewhat startled by  the sight, but nevertheless went to the door of his palace, and, with  a mournful countenance, presented her his hand to descend.    The fairy condoled with his majesty, and approved of all he had done.  Then, being a fairy of great common sense and foresight, she suggested  that the princess, awakening after a hundred years in this ancient  castle, might be a good deal embarrassed, especially with a young  prince by her side, to find herself alone. Accordingly, without asking  any one's leave, she touched with her magic wand the entire population  of the palace--except the king and queen; governesses, ladies of  honour, waiting-maids, gentlemen ushers, cooks, kitchen-girls, pages,  footmen--down to the horses that were in the stables, and the grooms  that attended them, she touched each and all. Nay, with kind  consideration for the feelings of the princess, she even touched the  little fat lap-dog, Puffy, who had laid himself down beside his  mistress on her splendid bed. He, like all the rest, fell fast asleep  in a moment.

ON THE ORIGIN, PROGRESS, AND DECLINE OF GOTHIC OR ENGLISH ECCLESIASTICAL  ARCHITECTURE.      Amongst the vestiges of antiquity which abound in this country, are the  visible memorials of those nations which have succeeded one another in the  occupancy of this island. To the age of our Celtic ancestors, the earliest  possessors of its soil, is ascribed the erection of those altars and  temples of all but primeval antiquity, the Cromlechs and Stone Circles  which lie scattered over the land; and these are conceived to have been  derived from the Phoenicians, whose merchants first introduced amongst  the aboriginal Britons the arts of incipient civilization. Of these most  ancient relics the prototypes appear, as described in Holy Writ, in the  pillar raised at Bethel by Jacob, in the altars erected by the Patriarchs,  and in the circles of stone set up by Moses at the foot of Mount Sinai,  and by Joshua at Gilgal. Many of these structures, perhaps from their very  rudeness, have survived the vicissitudes of time, whilst there scarce  remains a vestige of the temples erected in this island by the Romans; yet  it is from Roman edifices that we derive, and can trace by a gradual  transition, the progress of that peculiar kind of architecture called  GOTHIC, which presents in its later stages the most striking contrast that  can be imagined to its original precursor.    The Romans having conquered almost the whole of Britain in the first  century, retained possession of the southern parts for nearly four hundred  years; and during their occupancy they not only instructed the natives in  the arts of civilization, but also with their aid, as we learn from  Tacitus, began at an early period to erect temples and public edifices,  though doubtless much inferior to those at Rome, in their municipal towns  and cities. The Christian religion was also early introduced,[3-*] but for  a time its progress was slow; nor was it till the conversion of  Constantine, in the fourth century, that it was openly tolerated by the  state, and churches were publicly constructed for its worshippers; though  even before that event, as we are led to infer from the testimony of  Gildas, the most ancient of our native historians, particular structures  were appropriated for the performance of its divine mysteries: for that  historian alludes to the British Christians as reconstructing the churches  which had, in the Dioclesian persecution, been levelled to the ground. But  in the fifth century Rome, oppressed on every side by enemies, and  distracted with the vastness of her conquests, which she was no longer  able to maintain, recalled her legions from Britain; and the Romanized  Britons being left without protection, and having, during their subjection  to the Romans, lost their ancient valour and love of liberty, in a short  time fell a prey to the Northern Barbarians; in their extremity they  called over the Saxons to assist them, when the latter perceiving their  defenceless condition, turned round upon them, and made an easy conquest  of this country. In the struggle which then took place, the churches were  again destroyed, the priests were slain at the very altars,[4-*] and  though the British Church was never annihilated, Paganism for a while  became triumphant.    Towards the end of the sixth century, when Christianity was again  propagated in this country by Augustine, Mellitus, and other zealous  monks, St. Gregory, the head of the Papal church, and the originator of  this mission, wrote to Mellitus not to suffer the Heathen temples to be  destroyed, but only the idols found within them. These, and such churches  built by the Romans as were then, though in a dilapidated state, existing,  may reasonably be supposed to have been the prototypes of the Christian  churches afterwards erected in this country.    In the early period of the empire the Romans imitated the Grecians in  their buildings of magnitude and beauty, forming, however, a style of  greater richness in detail, though less chaste in effect; and columns of  the different orders, with their entablatures, were used to support and  adorn their public structures: but in the fourth century, when the arts  were declining, the style of architecture became debased, and the  predominant features consisted of massive square piers or columns, without  entablatures, from the imposts of which sprung arches of a semicircular  form; and it was in rude imitation of this latter style that the Saxon  churches were constructed.    The Roman basilicas, or halls of justice, some of which were subsequently  converted into churches, to which also their names were given, furnished  the plan for the internal arrangement of churches of a large size, being  divided in the interior by rows of columns. From this division the nave  and aisles of a church were derived; and in the semicircular recess at the  one end for the tribune, we perceive the origin of the apsis, or  semicircular east end, which one of the Anglo-Saxon, and many of our  ancient Norman churches still present.    But independent of examples afforded by some few ancient Roman churches,  and such of the temples and public buildings of the Romans as were then  remaining in Britain, the Saxon converts were directed and assisted in the  science of architecture by those missionaries from Rome who propagated  Christianity amongst them; and during the Saxon dynasty architects and  workmen were frequently procured from abroad, to plan and raise  ecclesiastical structures. The Anglo-Saxon churches were, however, rudely  built, and, as far as can be ascertained, with some few exceptions, were  of no great dimensions and almost entirely devoid of ornamental mouldings,  though in some instances decorative sculpture and mouldings are to be met  with; but in the repeated incursions of the Danes, in the ninth and tenth  centuries, so general was the destruction of the monasteries and churches,  which, when the country became tranquil, were rebuilt by the Normans, that  we have, in fact, comparatively few churches existing which we may  reasonably presume, or really know, to have been erected in an Anglo-Saxon  age. Many of the earlier writers on this subject have, however, caused  much confusion by applying the term 'SAXON' to all churches and other  edifices contradistinguished from the pointed style by semicircular-headed  doorways, windows, and arches. But the vestiges of Anglo-Saxon  architecture have been as yet so little studied or known, as to render it  difficult to point out, either generally or in detail, in what their  peculiarities consist: the style may, however, be said to have  approximated in"]]]
