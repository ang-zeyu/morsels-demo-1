In this case an added responsibility is involved, since one  who had so much to give to the world has been taken in his prime. M.  Petrucci has written at length of art in the Far East in his exhaustive  work _La Philosophie de la Nature dans l'Art d'Extreme Orient_ and  elsewhere, and has demonstrated the wide scope of his thought and  learning. The form and style in _Peintres Chinois_ are the result of much  condensation of material and have thus presented problems in translation,  to which earnest thought has been given.    In deference to the author's wish the margin has not been overladen and  only a short tribute, by one able to speak of him from personal knowledge,  has been included, together with a few footnotes and a short bibliography  of works of reference indispensable to the student who will pursue this  absorbing study. The translator takes this opportunity to make grateful  acknowledgement of her debt to the authors named, who have made such  valuable information available, and to those friends who have read the  manuscript and made many helpful suggestions.                                                  FRANCES SEAVER             *       *       *       *       *      BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE      In Raphael Petrucci, who died early in 1917, the world has lost one of the  ablest and most devoted students and interpreters of the art of the Far  East. He was only forty-five years of age, in the prime of his powers,  brimming with energy and full of enterprises that promised richly. Though  he did not die in the field, he was none the less a victim of the war. He  had exhausted himself by his labours with the Belgian ambulances at La  Panne, for Belgium was his adopted country. He had a house in Brussels,  filled with a collection of Chinese and Japanese art, and a little cottage  near the coast just over the borders of Holland. He came of the great and  ancient Sienese family of the Petrucci, but his mother was French and he  spent much of his earlier life in Paris, before settling in Brussels and  marrying one of the daughters of the painter Verwee. He had also spent  some time in Russia. In Brussels he was attached to the Institut Solvay.    He was a man of science, a student of and writer on sociology and biology.  He lectured on art and had a knowledge of the art of the world which few  men in Europe rivalled. He wrote a philosophic novel, _La Porte de l'Amour  et de la Mort_, which has run through several editions. He published a  book on Michelangelo's poetry. At the same time he was a scientific  engineer. When war broke out Petrucci was on his way home from Italy,  where he had been engaged, I believe, on some large engineering project  and he only got out of Switzerland into France by the last train which  left Basle. He came to England for a time, looking after a number of  Belgian refugees, including some very distinguished artists. At the end of  1914 he was engaged by the India office to do some valuable work in London  on the collection of Chinese and Tibetan paintings brought back from  Tun-huang by Sir Aurel Stein. He then worked at La Panne for the Belgian  army hospital (he had had a medical training in his youth), went to  Provence for a rest, fell ill and died in Paris after an operation.    Raphael Petrucci was a man who seemed to reincarnate the boundless  curiosity and the various ability of the men of the Italian Renaissance.  But for some years before his death he had concentrated his powers chiefly  on the study of Oriental art, of the Chinese language, and of Buddhist  iconography. His most important work in this line is _La Philosophie de la  Nature dans l'Art d'Extreme Orient_, a sumptuously printed folio published  by Laurens in Paris, with illustrations by the _Kokka_ Company, and  written with as much charm as insight. Petrucci's knowledge of Chinese  gave him an authority in interpreting Chinese art which writers on the  subject have rarely combined with so much understanding of art in  general, though as a connoisseur he was sometimes over-sanguine. His  translation from a classic of Chinese art-criticism, originally published  in a learned magazine, has lately appeared in book form. With his friend,  Professor Chavannes, whose death, also in the prime of life, we have had  to deplore still more recently, Petrucci edited the first volume of the  splendid series _Ars Asiatica_. The present work, intended for the general  reader and lover of art, illustrates his gift for luminous condensation  and the happy treatment of a large theme.    A man of winning manners, a most generous and loyal friend, Petrucci wore  his manifold learning lightly; with immense energy and force of character,  he was simple and warm-hearted and interested in the small things as well  as the great things of life.

The Fairy Tale of Father Brown            ONE -- The Absence of Mr Glass      THE consulting-rooms of Dr Orion Hood, the eminent criminologist and  specialist in certain moral disorders, lay along the sea-front at  Scarborough, in a series of very large and well-lighted french windows,  which showed the North Sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green  marble. In such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a  blue-green dado: for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a  terrible tidiness not unlike the terrible tidiness of the sea. It must  not be supposed that Dr Hood's apartments excluded luxury, or even  poetry. These things were there, in their place; but one felt that they  were never allowed out of their place. Luxury was there: there stood  upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars; but they  were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always nearest the  wall and the mildest nearest the window. A tantalus containing three  kinds of spirit, all of a liqueur excellence, stood always on this table  of luxury; but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky, brandy, and  rum seemed always to stand at the same level. Poetry was there: the  left-hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of  English classics as the right hand could show of English and foreign  physiologists. But if one took a volume of Chaucer or Shelley from that  rank, its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man's front teeth.  One could not say the books were never read; probably they were, but  there was a sense of their being chained to their places, like the  Bibles in the old churches. Dr Hood treated his private book-shelf as  if it were a public library. And if this strict scientific intangibility  steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables  laden with drink and tobacco, it goes without saying that yet more  of such heathen holiness protected the other shelves that held the  specialist's library, and the other tables that sustained the frail and  even fairylike instruments of chemistry or mechanics.    Dr Hood paced the length of his string of apartments, bounded--as the  boys' geographies say--on the east by the North Sea and on the west by  the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist library. He was  clad in an artist's velvet, but with none of an artist's negligence; his  hair was heavily shot with grey, but growing thick and healthy; his face  was lean, but sanguine and expectant. Everything about him and his room  indicated something at once rigid and restless, like that great northern  sea by which (on pure principles of hygiene) he had built his home.    Fate, being in a funny mood, pushed the door open and introduced into  those long, strict, sea-flanked apartments one who was perhaps the most  startling opposite of them and their master. In answer to a curt but  civil summons, the door opened inwards and there shambled into the room  a shapeless little figure, which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella  as unmanageable as a mass of luggage. The umbrella was a black and  prosaic bundle long past repair; the hat was a broad-curved black hat,  clerical but not common in England; the man was the very embodiment of  all that is homely and helpless.    The doctor regarded the new-comer with a restrained astonishment, not  unlike that he would have shown if some huge but obviously harmless  sea-beast had crawled into his room. The new-comer regarded the doctor  with that beaming but breathless geniality which characterizes a  corpulent charwoman who has just managed to stuff herself into an  omnibus. It is a rich confusion of social self-congratulation and bodily  disarray. His hat tumbled to the carpet, his heavy umbrella slipped  between his knees with a thud; he reached after the one and ducked  after the other, but with an unimpaired smile on his round face spoke  simultaneously as follows:    \"My name is Brown. Pray excuse me. I've come about that business of the  MacNabs. I have heard, you often help people out of such troubles. Pray  excuse me if I am wrong.\"    By this time he had sprawlingly recovered the hat, and made an odd  little bobbing bow over it, as if setting everything quite right.    \"I hardly understand you,\" replied the scientist, with a cold intensity  of manner. \"I fear you have mistaken the chambers. I am Dr Hood, and my  work is almost entirely literary and educational. It is true that I have  sometimes been consulted by the police in cases of peculiar difficulty  and importance, but--\"    \"Oh, this is of the greatest importance,\" broke in the little man called  Brown. \"Why, her mother won't let them get engaged.\" And he leaned back  in his chair in radiant rationality.    The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly, but the eyes under them  were bright with something that might be anger or might be amusement.  \"And still,\" he said, \"I do not quite understand.\"    \"You see, they want to get married,\" said the man with the clerical hat.  \"Maggie MacNab and young Todhunter want to get married. Now, what can be  more important than that?\"    The great Orion Hood's scientific triumphs had deprived him of many  things--some said of his health, others of his God; but they had not  wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd. At the last plea of the  ingenuous priest a chuckle broke out of him from inside, and he threw  himself into an arm-chair in an ironical attitude of the consulting  physician.    \"Mr Brown,\" he said gravely, \"it is quite fourteen and a half years  since I was personally asked to test a personal problem: then it was  the case of an attempt to poison the French President at a Lord Mayor's  Banquet. It is now, I understand, a question of whether some friend of  yours called Maggie is a suitable fiancee for some friend of hers called  Todhunter. Well, Mr Brown, I am a sportsman. I will take it on. I will  give the MacNab family my best advice, as good as I gave the French  Republic and the King of England--no, better: fourteen years better. I  have nothing else to do this afternoon. Tell me your story.\"    The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with unquestionable  warmth, but still with a queer kind of simplicity. It was rather as  if he were thanking a stranger in a smoking-room for some trouble in  passing the matches, than as if he were (as he was) practically thanking  the Curator of Kew Gardens for coming with him into a field to find a  four-leaved clover. With scarcely a semi-colon after his hearty thanks,  the little man began his recital:    \"I told you my name was Brown; well, that's the fact, and I'm the  priest of the little Catholic Church I dare say you've seen beyond those  straggly streets, where the town ends towards the north. In the last and  straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea like a sea-wall  there is a very honest but rather sharp-tempered member of my flock, a  widow called MacNab. She has one daughter, and she lets lodgings, and  between her and the daughter, and between her and the lodgers--well, I  dare say there is a great deal to be said on both sides. At present she  has only one lodger, the young man called Todhunter; but he has given  more trouble than all the rest, for he wants to marry the young woman of  the house.\"    \"And the young woman of the house,\" asked Dr Hood, with huge and silent  amusement, \"what does she want?\"    \"Why, she wants to marry him,\" cried Father Brown, sitting up eagerly.  \"That is just the awful complication.\"    \"It is indeed a hideous enigma,\" said Dr Hood.    \"This young James Todhunter,\" continued the cleric, \"is a very decent  man so far as I know; but then nobody knows very much. He is a bright,  brownish little fellow, agile like a monkey, clean-shaven like an actor,  and obliging like a born courtier. He seems to have quite a pocketful of  money, but nobody knows what his trade is. Mrs MacNab, therefore (being  of a pessimistic turn), is quite sure it is something dreadful, and  probably connected with dynamite. The dynamite must be of a shy and  noiseless sort, for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several  hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door. He declares  his privacy is temporary and justified, and promises to explain before  the wedding. That is all that anyone knows for certain, but Mrs MacNab  will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of. You know  how the tales grow like grass on such a patch of ignorance as that.  There are tales of two voices heard talking in the room; though, when  the door is opened, Todhunter is always found alone. There are tales of  a mysterious tall man in a silk hat, who once came out of the sea-mists  and apparently out of the sea, stepping softly across the sandy fields  and through the small back garden at twilight, till he was heard talking  to the lodger at his open window. The colloquy seemed to end in a  quarrel. Todhunter dashed down his window with violence, and the man in  the high hat melted into the sea-fog again. This story is told by the  family with the fiercest mystification; but I really think Mrs MacNab  prefers her own original tale: that the Other Man (or whatever it is)  crawls out every night from the big box in the corner, which is kept  locked all day. You see, therefore, how this sealed door of Todhunter's  is treated as the gate of all the fancies and monstrosities of the  'Thousand and One Nights'. And yet"]]]
