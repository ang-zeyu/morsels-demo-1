Peter lives upon a mountain    Pretty near the sun,    Knows the bears and birds and rabbits    Nearly every one;    Has a home among the alders,    Bed of cedar bark,    Walks alone beneath the pine trees    Even when it's dark.      Squirrels tell him everything    That happens in the trees,    Cricket in the gander-grass    Sings of all he sees;    Rimes from bats and butterflies,    Crabs and waterfowl;    But the best of all he gets    From his Uncle Owl.      Sometimes when its day-time,    But mostly in the night,    They sit beneath an oak tree    And hug each other tight,    And tell their rimes and riddles    Where the catty creatures prowl--    Funny little Peter Patter    And his Uncle Owl._            LIST OF THE RHYMES                                                  PAGE      A Copper Down a Crack                        9      I'm Much Too Big for a Fairy                 9      Did You Ever Play Tag with a Tiger?

BARNES AND COMPANY    _This book is fully protected by copyright and nothing  that appears in it may be reprinted or reproduced in any  manner, either wholly or in part, for any use whatever,  without special written permission of the copyright owner._      +Printed in the United States of America+          PREFACE      The following rhythmic plays compiled by Mr. John N. Richards of the  Newark Department of Physical Education have been devised to meet the  needs in the transition of Physical Education activities between the  kindergarten and the first few years of the primary school.    The physiologist tells us that the nervous organism of early childhood  is injured by the strain of strict, immobile attention required in  formal gymnastics. Therefore it is wise to hold the child's interest and  attention by means of dramatized nursery plays. These make little strain  on mental application and the child is able to dramatize in motion the  words and music which are planned to develop his motor co-ordination. In  this way the child is gradually and interestingly led from the freedom  of expression, characteristic of babyhood to the more specialized formal  activities of the third and fourth years in the school.    Mr. Richards' contribution merits widespread usage because he has  clearly and definitely described his rhythm plays so that the classroom  teacher can easily make use of them without having to draw on her  imagination or having to guess at the written explanation.    The book should be useful and welcomed too, not only by the classroom  teacher but also by the specialist and supervisor of Physical Education.      Randall D. Warden    Director of Physical Education, Newark, N.J., Public Schools          INTRODUCTION      The young people of to-day are most fortunate in their opportunities and  advantages. The home, the school, the shop, social life and play offer  increasing fields for service. The ever increasing number of problems  which must be faced, in this reconstruction period of our nation's life,  demands leaders of broad intellect, clear vision and sound judgment.  Coupled with these qualifications there must be developed a moral  earnestness which will make for better citizenship.    The trend of society movement is undoubtedly toward congested city  life. There is lamentable lack of playgrounds and properly equipped  gymnasiums. The school buildings are crowded to capacity and there is a  rush and hurry of life which challenges the attention of all educators  who are interested in the physical well-being of children.    The priceless assets of our communities are the boys and girls who are  growing into manhood and womanhood. We should spare neither expense nor  energy in fitting them physically, mentally and spiritually for the  great problems which will all too soon be theirs.    Exercise habits and a spirit of fair play must be a part of their  training from the early school days. There is no better way of  inculcating these lessons than through story plays and games during  their first school years.    The material contained in this book is practical. The exercise movements  have been set to music which is popular both in the schools and in the  homes. It is carefully graded and should prove to be of great assistance  to the teachers in the lower grades. It tends to bridge over the gap  between the Kindergarten and the Primary Grade activities.    There is need for a manual of this type in our Physical Training  literature and it is hoped that this material will be used generally  throughout the schools of our country.      F. W.
