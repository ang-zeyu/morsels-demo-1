The object of this work has been from historical data to show that the  Southern States had rightfully the power to withdraw from a Union into  which they had, as sovereign communities, voluntarily entered; that the  denial of that right was a violation of the letter and spirit of the  compact between the States; and that the war waged by the Federal  Government against the seceding States was in disregard of the  limitations of the Constitution, and destructive of the principles of  the Declaration of Independence.    The author, from his official position, may claim to have known much of  the motives and acts of his countrymen immediately before and during the  war of 1861-'65, and he has sought to furnish material far the future  historian, who, when the passions and prejudices of the day shall have  given place to reason and sober thought, may, better than a  contemporary, investigate the causes, conduct, and results of the war.    The incentive to undertake the work now offered to the public was the  desire to correct misapprehensions created by industriously circulated  misrepresentations as to the acts and purposes of the people and the  General Government of the Confederate States. By the reiteration of such  unappropriate terms as \"rebellion\" and \"treason,\" and the asseveration  that the South was levying war against the United States, those ignorant  of the nature of the Union, and of the reserved powers of the States,  have been led to believe that the Confederate States were in the  condition of revolted provinces, and that the United States were forced  to resort to arms for the preservation of their existence. To those who  knew that the Union was formed for specific enumerated purposes, and  that the States had never surrendered their sovereignty it was a  palpable absurdity to apply to them, or to their citizens when obeying  their mandates, the terms \"rebellion\" and \"treason\"; and, further, it is  shown in the following pages that the Confederate States, so far from  making war or seeking to destroy the United States, as soon as they had  an official organ, strove earnestly, by peaceful recognition, to  equitably adjust all questions growing out of the separation from their  late associates.    Another great perversion of truth has been the arraignment of the men  who participated in the formation of the Confederacy and who bore arms  in its defense, as the instigators of a controversy leading to disunion.  Sectional issues appear conspicuously in the debates of the Convention  which framed the Federal Constitution, and its many compromises were  designed to secure an equilibrium between the sections, and to preserve  the interests as well as the liberties of the several States. African  servitude at that time was not confined to a section, but was  numerically greater in the South than in the North, with a tendency to  its continuance in the former and cessation in the latter. It therefore  thus early presents itself as a disturbing element, and the provisions  of the Constitution, which were known to be necessary for its adoption,  bound all the States to recognize and protect that species of property.  When at a subsequent period there arose in the Northern States an  antislavery agitation, it was a harmless and scarcely noticed movement  until political demagogues seized upon it as a means to acquire power.  Had it been left to pseudo-philanthropists and fanatics, most zealous  where least informed, it never could have shaken the foundations of the  Union and have incited one section to carry fire and sword into the  other. That the agitation was political in its character, and was  clearly developed as early as 1803, it is believed has been established  in these pages. To preserve a sectional equilibrium and to maintain the  equality of the States was the effort on one side, to acquire empire was  the manifest purpose on the other. This struggle began before the men of  the Confederacy were born; how it arose and how it progressed it has  been attempted briefly to show. Its last stage was on the question of  territorial governments; and, if in this work it has not been  demonstrated that the position of the South was justified by the  Constitution and the equal rights of the people of all the States, it  must be because the author has failed to present the subject with a  sufficient degree of force and clearness.    In describing the events of the war, space has not permitted, and the  loss of both books and papers has prevented, the notice of very many  entitled to consideration, as well for the humanity as the gallantry of  our men in the unequal combats they fought. These numerous omissions, it  is satisfactory to know, the official reports made at the time and the  subsequent contributions which have been and are being published by the  actors, will supply more fully and graphically than could have been done  in this work.    Usurpations of the Federal Government have been presented, not in a  spirit of hostility, but as a warning to the people against the dangers  by which their liberties are beset. When the war ceased, the pretext on  which it had been waged could no longer be alleged. The emancipation  proclamation of Mr. Lincoln, which, when it was issued, he humorously  admitted to be a nullity, had acquired validity by the action of the  highest authority known to our institutions--the people assembled in  their several State Conventions. The soldiers of the Confederacy had  laid down their arms, had in good faith pledged themselves to abstain  from further hostile operations, and had peacefully dispersed to their  homes; there could not, then, have been further dread of them by the  Government of the United States. The plea of necessity could, therefore,  no longer exist for hostile demonstration against the people and States  of the deceased Confederacy. Did vengeance, which stops at the grave,  subside? Did real peace and the restoration of the States to their  former rights and positions follow, as was promised on the restoration  of the Union? Let the recital of the invasion of the reserved powers of  the States, or the people, and the perversion of the republican form of  government guaranteed to each State by the Constitution, answer the  question. For the deplorable fact of the war, for the cruel manner in  which it was waged, for the sad physical and yet sadder moral results it  produced, the reader of these pages, I hope, will admit that the South,  in the forum of conscience, stands fully acquitted.    Much of the past is irremediable; the best hope for a restoration in the  future to the pristine purity and fraternity of the Union, rests on the  opinions and character of the men who are to succeed this generation:  that they maybe suited to that blessed work, one, whose public course is  ended, invokes them to draw their creed from the fountains of our  political history, rather than from the lower stream, polluted as it has  been by self-seeking place-hunters and by sectional strife.

[v.04 p.0773]    BULGARIA (_continued from part 3_)    ... the mean interval being 60 m.; the summits are, as a rule, rounded, and  the slopes gentle. The culminating points are in the centre of the range:  Yumrukchal (7835 ft.), Maraguduk (7808 ft.), and Kadimlia (7464 ft.). The  Balkans are known to the people of the country as the _Stara Planina_ or  \"Old Mountain,\" the adjective denoting their greater size as compared with  that of the adjacent ranges: \"Balkan\" is not a distinctive term, being  applied by the Bulgarians, as well as the Turks, to all mountains. Closely  parallel, on the south, are the minor ranges of the Sredna Gora or \"Middle  Mountains\" (highest summit 5167 ft.) and the Karaja Dagh, enclosing  respectively the sheltered valleys of Karlovo and Kazanlyk. At its eastern  extremity the Balkan chain divides into three ridges, the central  terminating in the Black Sea at Cape Emine (\"Haemus\"), the northern forming  the watershed between the tributaries of the Danube and the rivers falling  directly into the Black Sea. The Rhodope, or southern group, is altogether  distinct from the Balkans, with which, however, it is connected by the  Malka Planina and the Ikhtiman hills, respectively west and east of Sofia;  it may be regarded as a continuation of the great Alpine system which  traverses the Peninsula from the Dinaric Alps and the Shar Planina on the  west to the Shabkhana Dagh near the Aegean coast; its sharper outlines and  pine-clad steeps reproduce the scenery of the Alps rather than that of the  Balkans. The imposing summit of Musalla (9631 ft.), next to Olympus, the  highest in the Peninsula, forms the centre-point of the group; it stands  within the Bulgarian frontier at the head of the Mesta valley, on either  side of which the Perin Dagh and the Despoto Dagh descend south and  south-east respectively towards the Aegean. The chain of Rhodope proper  radiates to the east; owing to the retrocession of territory already  mentioned, its central ridge no longer completely coincides with the  Bulgarian boundary, but two of its principal summits, Sytke (7179 ft.) and  Karlyk (6828 ft.), are within the frontier. From Musalla in a westerly  direction extends the majestic range of the Rilska Planina, enclosing in a  picturesque valley the celebrated monastery of Rila; many summits of this  chain attain 7000 ft. Farther west, beyond the Struma valley, is the  Osogovska Planina, culminating in Ruyen (7392 ft.). To the north of the  Rilska Planina the almost isolated mass of Vitosha (7517 ft.) overhangs  Sofia. Snow and ice remain in the sheltered crevices of Rhodope and the  Balkans throughout the summer. The fertile slope trending northwards from  the Balkans to the Danube is for the most part gradual and broken by hills;  the eastern portion known as the _Deli Orman_, or \"Wild Wood,\" is covered  by forest, and thinly inhabited. The abrupt and sometimes precipitous  character of the Bulgarian bank of the Danube contrasts with the swampy  lowlands and lagoons of the Rumanian side. Northern Bulgaria is watered by  the Lom, Ogust, Iskr, Vid, Osem, Yantra and Eastern Lom, all, except the  Iskr, rising in the Balkans, and all flowing into the Danube. The channels  of these rivers are deeply furrowed and the fall is rapid; irrigation is  consequently difficult and navigation impossible. The course of the Iskr is  remarkable: rising in the Rilska Planina, the river descends into the basin  of Samakov, passing thence through a serpentine defile into the plateau of  Sofia, where in ancient times it formed a lake; it now forces its way  through the Balkans by the picturesque gorge of Iskretz. Somewhat similarly  the Deli, or \"Wild,\" Kamchik breaks the central chain of the Balkans near  their eastern extremity and, uniting with the Great Kamchik, falls into the  Black Sea. The Maritza, the ancient _Hebrus_, springs from the slopes of  Musalla, and, with its tributaries, the Tunja and Arda, waters the wide  plain of Eastern Rumelia. The Struma (ancient and modern Greek _Strymon_)  drains the valley of Kiustendil, and, like the Maritza, flows into the  Aegean. The elevated basins of Samakov (lowest altitude 3050 ft.), Trn  (2525 ft.), Breznik (2460 ft.), Radomir (2065 ft.), Sofia (1640 ft.), and  Kiustendil (1540 ft.), are a peculiar feature of the western highlands.    [Illustration]    _Geology._--The stratified formation presents a remarkable variety, almost  all the systems being exemplified. The Archean, composed of gneiss and  crystalline schists, and traversed by eruptive veins, extends over the  greater part of the Eastern Rumelian plain, the Rilska Planina, Rhodope,  and the adjacent ranges. North of the Balkans it appears only in the  neighbourhood of Berkovitza. The other earlier Palaeozoic systems are  wanting, but the Carboniferous appears in the western Balkans with a  continental _facies_ (Kulm). Here anthracitiferous coal is found in beds of  argillite and sandstone. Red sandstone and conglomerate, representing the  Permian system, appear especially around the basin of Sofia. Above these,  in the western Balkans, are Mesozoic deposits, from the Trias to the upper  Jurassic, also occurring in the central part of the range. The Cretaceous  system, from the infra-Cretaceous Hauterivien to the Senonian, appears  throughout the whole extent of Northern Bulgaria, from the summits of the  Balkans to the Danube. Gosau beds are found on the southern declivity of  the chain. Flysch, representing both the Cretaceous and Eocene systems, is  widely distributed. The Eocene, or older Tertiary, further appears with  nummulitic formations on both sides of the eastern Balkans; the Oligocene  only near the Black Sea coast at Burgas. Of the Neogene, or younger  Tertiary, the Mediterranean, or earlier, stage appears near Pleven (Plevna)  in the Leithakalk and Tegel forms, and between Varna and Burgas with beds  of spaniodons, as in the Crimea; the Sarmatian stage in the plain of the  Danube and in the districts of Silistria and Varna. A rich mammaliferous  deposit (_Hipparion_, _Rhinoceros_, _Dinotherium_, _Mastodon_, &c.) of this  period has been found near Mesemvria. Other Neogene strata occupy a more  limited space. The Quaternary era is represented by the typical loess,  which covers most of the Danubian plain; to its later epochs belong the  alluvial deposits of the riparian districts with remains of the _Ursus_,  _Equus_, &c., found in bone-caverns. Eruptive masses intrude in the Balkans  and Sredna Gora, as well as in the Archean formation of the southern [v.04  p.0774] ranges, presenting granite, syenite, diorite, diabase,  quartz-porphyry, melaphyre, liparite, trachyte, andesite, basalt, &c.    _Minerals._--The mineral wealth of Bulgaria is considerable, although, with  the exception of coal, it remains largely unexploited. The minerals which  are commercially valuable include gold (found in small quantities), silver,  graphite, galena, pyrite, marcasite, chalcosine, sphalerite, chalcopyrite,  bornite, cuprite, hematite, limonite, ochre, chromite, magnetite, azurite,  manganese, malachite, gypsum, &c. The combustibles are anthracitiferous  coal, coal, \"brown coal\" and lignite. The lignite mines opened by the  government at Pernik in 1891 yielded in 1904 142,000 tons. Coal beds have  been discovered at Trevna and elsewhere. Thermal springs, mostly  sulphureous, exist in forty-three localities along the southern slope of  the Balkans, in Rhodope, and in the districts of Sofia and Kiustendil;  maximum temperature at Zaparevo, near Dupnitza, 180.5 deg. (Fahrenheit), at  Sofia 118.4 deg.. Many of these are frequented now, as in Roman times, owing to  their valuable therapeutic qualities. The mineral springs on the north of  the Balkans are, with one exception (Vrshetz, near Berkovitza), cold.    _Climate._--The severity of the climate of Bulgaria in comparison with that  of other European regions of the same latitude is attributable in part to  the number and extent of its mountain ranges, in part to the general  configuration of the Balkan Peninsula. Extreme heat in summer and cold in  winter, great local contrasts, and rapid transitions of temperature occur  here as in the adjoining countries. The local contrasts are remarkable. In  the districts extending from the Balkans to the Danube, which are exposed  to the bitter north wind, the winter cold is intense, and the river,  notwithstanding the volume and rapidity of its current, is frequently  frozen over; the temperature has been known to fall to 24 deg. below zero.  Owing to the shelter afforded by the Balkans against hot southerly winds,  the summer heat in this region is not unbearable; its maximum is 99 deg.. The  high tableland of Sofia is generally covered with snow in the winter  months; it enjoys, however, a somewhat more equable climate than the  northern district, the maximum temperature being 86 deg., the minimum 2 deg.; the  air is bracing, and the summer nights are cool and fresh. In the eastern  districts the proximity of the sea moderates the extremes of heat and cold;  the sea is occasionally frozen at Varna. The coast-line is exposed to  violent north-east winds, and the Black Sea, the [Greek: pontos axeinos] or  \"inhospitable sea\" of the Greeks, maintains its evil reputation for storms.
