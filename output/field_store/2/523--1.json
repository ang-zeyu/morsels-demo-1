OGILVIE PUBLISHING COMPANY          _FOREWORD_      _This is the history of a Lie--of a cruel and terrible Lie invented for  the purpose of defaming the entire Jewish people. Given out as fiction,  by a German anti-Semitic writer, involved in the Waldeck forgery case,  who concealed his identity under the pen-name of an Englishman, it was  gradually changed and elaborated, and finally groomed as fact. Agents of  the Russian secret police department and of the unscrupulous \"Black  Hundreds\" then utilized this fiction as the framework for the  \"protocols\" through which they sought to crush the Jews and prop up the  tottering Russian dynasty._    _Tsarism destroyed itself, but the agents of Tsarism, still dreaming of  their past glory and of a restoration of their privileges, are at work  again, both here and abroad._    _Out of the scrapheap of Russian autocracy, they have exhumed their old  weapons and are striking at the Jews again. Upon the structure of the  old myths they are striving to erect new falsehoods in order to  intensify everywhere chaos and confusion and dissatisfaction so that  they may attain their own dastardly and selfish ends._    _In the war's aftermath the Jews are being blamed by the minions of  autocracy and reaction for all the ills that have befallen mankind. Some  blame them for the war, and others for the peace. Some attack them for  the defeat of the German military machine, and others for the victory of  the allies. In Germany they are attacked by the Junkers for having  opposed the submarine warfare and thus assured Germany's defeat; while  in some of the allied countries the Jews are denounced for constituting  \"the brains of Germany.\" All the revolutionary leaders of Germany are  credited to the Jews, and bolshevism, which has as little in common with  Judaism as it has with Christianity, is branded as a Jewish movement;  and there are Jew-baiters who in their blind madness have gone so far as  to declare that ex-Kaiser Wilhelm was not only influenced by the Jews  but is himself of Jewish descent, and for this reason did not defend  Germany as loyally as he should have done. He conspired against the  Hohenzollern dynasty and undermined it. He destroyed his own throne  because he was serving the secret Jewish world organization._    _On such absurdities have people been fed, since the armistice, in  civilized countries by antisemitic agitators and their dupes, while Jews  have been slaughtered in the Ukraine, in Poland and in Hungary._    _I submit in this little book the documentary evidence showing how the  so-called \"Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" on which this new crusade  is predicated, were forged._    HERMAN BERNSTEIN.    _New York, February, 1921._          CONTENTS                                                                 PAGE  FOREWORD                                                      3      CHAPTER ONE  THE MYSTERIOUS PROTOCOLS    The Lie of a Jewish World Conspiracy--Is There a Jewish  Conspiracy?--Anonymous Accusations--The Mysterious  \"Protocols\" of Sergei Nilus--How did \"Nilus\" Secure  Them?--Contradictory Explanations--Who is \"Nilus\"?

Is there a Jewish conspiracy against the world or is there a conspiracy  against the Jews? What are the so-called \"Protocols of the Wise Men of  Zion?\" Who is \"the Russian mystic,\" Sergius Nilus, the sponsor of the  Protocols? What forces are behind the anti-Jewish propaganda that is  international in scope and that seeks at this time to spread all over  the world the poison of prejudice and hatred against the Jews, reviving  long-exploded mediaeval legends?    Many Americans have asked these questions ever since the publication of  \"The Cause of the World Unrest,\" \"The Protocols and World Revolution,\"  \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion,\" and the anti-Jewish articles in  Henry Ford's Dearborn Independent.    In 1919 a translation of extracts from what purports to be a book by one  Sergius Nilus was published in Germany. During 1920 a translation was  published in England under the name of \"The Jewish Peril,\" and under  various titles, in different versions, it was reproduced in the United  States, France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and even Japan. The Japanese  edition is in the Russian language. In all these books \"the Russian  mystic,\" Sergius Nilus, is given as the sponsor of a number of secret  \"documents\" by which it is intended to show that the Jews are  responsible for all the ills that have already befallen the world and  that are still to come.    The method is simple. Was there a revolution in Russia? Blame the Jews.  Was there a revolution in Germany? Blame the Jews. Who made the French  Revolution? The Jews. Who caused the World War? The Jews. Who profited  by the war? The Jews. Is there anywhere an industrial crisis? The Jews  are, of course, the cause of it. Has the World War brought forth  Bolshevism? The Jews are naturally the fathers of it. First the Jews  engineered the war, and then they pulled the strings behind the scenes  of the Peace Conference. They secured special privileges at the Peace  Table, because, according to the Protocols, they control the gold of the  world, the press of the world, the rulers of the world. And if, as a  result of the World War, millions of Jews have suffered untold agonies,  persecution, starvation, and pogroms, it is no doubt only part of their  deep-laid plot to gain control of the world for Zion through poverty and  suffering!    Are governments just to the Jews, giving them equal rights? Then it is  obvious that Jews are either at the head of such governments or are  hidden behind the present rulers. If the Jews cannot exert sufficient  influence over the rulers themselves, there are Jewesses in high places,  through whom the cause of Zion is served--and all this is done by the  Jews with but one aim in view--to dominate the world, to become its  autocratic masters, to break down the moral power of Christendom and set  up Israel as \"the despot\" over the peoples of the earth. According to  the Protocols, all this is engineered with the aid and through the  instrumentality of the Freemasons.    The propagandists everywhere, in Germany, England, France, the  Scandinavian countries, Japan and the United States, basing all their  arguments on the \"Protocols\" vouched for by \"the Russian mystic\" Sergius  Nilus, see in the present chaotic conditions the absolute fulfillment of  the prophecies outlined by the so-called \"Wise Men of Zion\" years ago.  The propagandists are violent and vicious, foaming at their mouths,  appealing to the basest passions,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19206"],[0,"Under Drake's Flag: A Tale of the Spanish Main (#1)"],[1,"Drake's Flag:    A Tale of the Spanish Main  by G A Henty.

Chapter 1: The Wreck on the Devon Coast.        It was a Stormy morning in the month of May, 1572; and the  fishermen of the little village of Westport, situate about five  miles from Plymouth, clustered in the public house of the place;  and discussed, not the storm, for that was a common topic, but the  fact that Master Francis Drake, whose ships lay now at Plymouth,  was visiting the Squire of Treadwood, had passed through the  village over night, and might go through it again, today. There was  not one of the hardy fishermen there but would gladly have joined  Drake's expedition, for marvellous tales had been told of the great  booty which he, and other well-known captains, had already obtained  from the Dons on the Spanish Main. The number, however, who could  go was limited, and even of these the seafaring men were but a  small proportion; for in those days, although a certain number of  sailors were required to trim the sails and navigate the ship, the  strength of the company were the fighting men, who were soldiers by  trade, and fought on board ship as if on land.    Captain Drake was accompanied by many men of good Devon blood, for  that county was then ahead of all England in its enterprise, and  its seamanship; and no captain of name or repute ever had any  difficulty in getting together a band of adventurers, from the  sturdy population of her shores.    \"I went over myself, last week,\" said a finely-built young sailor,  \"and I prayed the captain, on my knees, to take me on board; but he  said the tale had been full, long ago; and that so many were the  applicants that Master Drake and himself had sworn a great oath,  that they would take none beyond those already engaged.\"    \"Aye! I would have gone myself,\" said a grizzly, weatherbeaten old  sailor, \"if they would have had me. There was Will Trelawney, who  went on such another expedition as this, and came back with more  bags of Spanish dollars than he could carry. Truly they are a gold  mine, these Western seas; but even better than getting gold is the  thrashing of those haughty Spaniards, who seem to look upon  themselves as gods, and on all others as fit only to clean their  worships' boots.\"    \"They cannot fight neither, can they?\" asked a young sailor.    \"They can fight, boy, and have fought as well as we could; but,  somehow, they cannot stand against us, in those seas. Whether it is  that the curse of the poor natives, whom they kill, enslave, and  ill treat in every way, rises against them, and takes away their  courage and their nerve; but certain is it that, when our little  craft lay alongside their big galleons, fight as they will, the  battle is as good as over. Nothing less than four to one, at the  very least, has any chance against our buccaneers.\"    \"They ill treat those that fall into their hands, do they not?\"    \"Ay, do they!\" said the old sailor. \"They tear off their flesh with  hot pincers, wrench out their nails, and play all sorts of devil's  games; and then, at last, they burn what is left of them in the  marketplaces. I have heard tell of fearsome tales, lad; but the  Spaniards outwit themselves. Were our men to have fair treatment as  prisoners of war, it may be that the Spaniards would often be able  to hold their own against us; but the knowledge that, if we are  taken, this horrible fate is certain to be ours, makes our men  fight with a desperate fury; and never to give in, as long as one  is left. This it is that accounts for the wonderful victories which  we have gained there. He would be a coward, indeed, who would not  fight with thumbscrews and a bonfire behind him.\"    \"It is said that the queen and her ministers favor, though not  openly, these adventures.\"    \"She cannot do it openly,\" said the old man, \"for here in Europe we  are at peace with Spain--worse luck.\"    \"How is it, then, that if we are at peace here, we can be at war in  the Indian Seas?\"    \"That is more than I can tell thee, lad. I guess the queen's writ  runs not so far as that; and while her majesty's commands must be  obeyed, and the Spanish flag suffered to pass unchallenged, on  these seas; on the Spanish main there are none to keep the peace,  and the Don and the Englishman go at each other's throats, as a  thing of nature.\"    \"The storm is rising, methinks. It is not often I have heard the  wind howl more loudly. It is well that the adventurers have not yet  started. It would be bad for any craft caught in the Channel,  today.\"    As he spoke, he looked from the casement. Several people were seen  hurrying towards the beach.    \"Something is the matter, lads; maybe a ship is driving on the  rocks, even now.\"    Seizing their hats and cloaks, the party sallied out, and hurried  down to the shore. There they saw a large ship, driving in before  the wind into the bay. She was making every effort that seamanship  could suggest, to beat clear of the head; but the sailors saw, at  once, that her case was hopeless.    \"She will go on the Black Shoal, to a certainty,\" the old sailor  said; \"and then, may God have mercy on their souls.\"    \"Can we do nothing to help them?\" a woman standing near asked.    \"No, no,\" the sailor said; \"we could not launch a boat, in the  teeth of this tremendous sea. All we can do is to look out, and  throw a line to any who may be washed ashore, on a spar, when she  goes to pieces.\"    Presently a group of men, whose dress belonged to the upper class,  moved down through the street to the beach.    \"Aye! there is Mr. Trevelyan,\" said the sailor, \"and the gentleman  beside him is Captain Drake, himself.\"    The group moved on to where the fishermen were standing.    \"Is there no hope,\" they asked, \"of helping the ship?\"    The seamen shook their heads.    \"You will see for yourself, Master Drake, that no boat could live  in such a sea as this.\"    \"It could not put out from here,\" the Captain said; \"but if they  could lower one from the ship, it might live until it got into the  breakers.\"    \"Aye, aye,\" said a sailor; \"but there is no lowering a boat from a  ship which has begun to beat on the Black Shoal.\"    \"Another minute and she will strike,\" the old sailor said.    All gazed intently at the ship. The whole population of the village  were now on the shore, and were eager to render any assistance, if  it were possible. In another minute or two, a general cry announced  that the ship had struck. Rising high on a wave, she came down with  a force which caused her mainmast at once to go over the side.  Another lift on the next sea and then, high and fast, she was  jammed on the rocks of the Black Shoal. The distance from shore was  but small, not more than three hundred yards, and the shouts of the  sailors on board could be heard in the storm.    \"Why does not one of them jump over, with a rope?\" Captain Drake  said, impatiently. \"Are the men all cowards, or can none of them  swim? It would be easy to swim from that ship to the shore, while  it is next to impossible for anyone to make his way out, through  these breakers.    \"Is there no one who can reach her from here?\" he said, looking  round.    \"No one among us, your honor,\" the old sailor said. \"Few here can  keep themselves up in the water, in a calm sea; but if man or boy  could swim through that surf, it is the lad who is just coming down  from behind us. The Otter, as we call him, for he seems to be able  to live, in water, as well as on land.\"    The lad of whom they were speaking was a bright-faced boy, of some  fifteen years of age. He was squarely built, and his dress differed  a little from that of the fisher lads standing on the beach.    \"Who is he?\" asked Captain Drake.    \"He is the son of the schoolmaster here, a learned man, and they do  say one who was once wealthy. The lad himself would fain go to sea,  but his father keeps him here. It is a pity, for he is a bold boy,  and would make a fine sailor.\"    The Otter, as he had been called, had now come down to the beach;  and, with his hands shading his eyes from the spray, sheets of  which the wind carried along with blinding force, he gazed at the  ship and the sea, with a steady intentness.    \"I think I can get out to her,\" he said, to the fishermen.    \"It is madness, boy,\" Captain Drake said. \"There are few men,  indeed, so far as I know, in these climes--I talk not of the  heathens of the Western Islands--who could swim through a breaking  sea, like yonder.\"    \"I think I can do it,\" the boy said, quietly. \"I have been out in  as heavy seas before, and if one does but choose one's time, and  humor them a bit, the waves are not much to be feared, after all.    \"Get me the light line,\" he said, to the sailors, \"and I will be  off, at once.\"    So saying, he carelessly threw off his clothes. The fishermen  brought a light line. One end they fastened round his shoulders  and, with a cheerful goodbye, he ran down to the water's edge.    The sea was breaking with tremendous violence, and the chance of  the lad's getting out, through the breakers, appeared slight,  indeed. He watched, however, quietly for three or four minutes,  when a wave larger than usual broke on the beach. Following it out,  he stood"]]]
