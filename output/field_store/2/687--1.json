But in sciences of conceit the first author goeth  farthest, and time leeseth and corrupteth.... In the former, many wits  and industries contributed in one. In the latter, many men's wits spent  to deprave the wit of one.\"    I fear that literary criticism of the kind that I propose to myself in  these chapters on Milton must be classified with the \"sciences of  conceit.\" Indeed, Bacon puts it out of question that he himself would so  have regarded it, for he goes on to explain how, after the deliverances  of a master, \"then begin men to aspire to the second prizes, to be a  profound interpreter and commentor, to be a sharp champion and defender,  to be a methodical compounder and abridger. And this is the unfortunate  succession of wits which the world hath yet had, whereby the patrimony of  all knowledge goeth not on husbanded and improved, but wasted and  decayed.\"    The blow is aimed at the scholastic philosophers, but it falls heavy on  the critics of literature, on all who \"aspire to the second prizes,\" or  who think \"that a borrowed light can increase the original light from  whom it is taken.\" It is a searching arraignment of all who set  themselves to expound in words the meaning and purpose of a master of  verbal expression. Yet the very breadth of the indictment brings comfort  and a means of escape. For the chief difficulties of an attempt to  understand and judge Milton are difficulties inherent in the nature, not  only of all criticism in the large sense, but also of all reading. In  this association with great spirits which we call reading we receive but  what we give, and take away only what we are fit to carry. Milton himself  has stated the doctrine in its most absolute form, and has sought an  enhanced authority for it by attributing it to the Christ--                          Who reads    Incessantly, and to his reading brings not    A spirit and judgment equal or superior    (And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)    Uncertain and unsettled still remains,    Deep versed in books and shallow in himself,    Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys    And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge,    As children gathering pebbles on the shore.    Literally taken, this is the negation of all the higher functions of  criticism, and the paralysis of all learning. Only his peers, it is  argued, can read Shakespeare intelligently; and, as if that did not give  him few enough readers, they are further told that they will be wasting  their time! But love, unlike this proud Stoicism, is humble, and  contented with a little.

Gwen Gascoyne! Gwen! Anybody seen her? I say, have you all gone  deaf? Don't you hear me? Where's Gwen? I--want--Gwen--Gascoyne!\"    The speaker--Ida Bridge--a small, perky, spindle-legged Junior, jumped  on to the nearest seat, and raising her shrill voice to its topmost  pitch, twice shouted the \"Gwen Gascoyne\", with an aggressive energy  calculated to make herself heard above the babel of general chatter  that pervaded the schoolroom. Her effort, though far from musical, at  any rate secured her the notice she desired.    \"Hello, there! Stop that noise! It's like a dog howling!\" irately  commanded a girl in spectacles who was cleaning the blackboard.    \"And get down from my desk this minute! Who said you might climb up  there?\"    \"Look here, you kid, what are you doing in our classroom?\"    \"Take yourself off at once! Fly! Scoot!\"    The \"kid\", however, stood her ground.    \"Shan't move till you've answered my question,\" she replied with  aggravating impudence. \"I want Gwen Gascoyne.\"    \"Why, there she is all the time!\"    \"Where?\"    \"Under your very nose, you stupid baby! Get down from my desk, I tell  you!\"    The Junior cast what was intended to be a withering glance before she  descended.    \"Gwen Gascoyne, why couldn't you answer when I called you?\" she  demanded abruptly.    Gwen paused in the act of sharpening a lead pencil, and eyed the  intruder.    \"Who asked you to come in here?\" she retorted.    \"You babes must keep to your own classrooms! Hey, presto! Vanish! And  be quick about it!\" interposed Myra Johnson.    \"Shan't! Not till I've spoken to Gwen.\"    \"Cheek!\"    \"Suppress that kid!\"    \"But I've got a message!\" squeaked the babe, as sundry arms of justice  thrust her summarily in the direction of the door. \"Oh, I have  really--a message for Gwen from Miss Roscoe! She's to go to the  library--now!\"    \"Then why couldn't you say so at first?\"    \"You never gave me a chance!\"    Gwen threw the half-sharpened pencil inside her desk and banged down  the lid.    \"What does Miss Roscoe want with me?\" she asked in some consternation.  \"Are you sure she meant me?\"    A summons from the headmistress rarely boded good fortune to the  recipient, and the girls stared at Gwen with interested sympathy.    \"What have you been doing?\" murmured Eve Dawkins.    \"Glad I'm not in your shoes!\" proclaimed Daisy Hurst.    \"Oh, Gwen, I am sorry for you!\" bleated Alma Richardson.    \"I've not been doing anything!\" protested Gwen indignantly. \"You've no  need to look at me as if I were a cross between a criminal and a  martyr! Here, you babe, what did Miss Roscoe say?\"    \"Only that you're to go to the library; and you'd better be quick,  because she said: 'Tell her to come at once!' Said it in her snappiest  way, too! I shouldn't be a month about going if I were you. Hello!  There's the bell. Ta-ta, I'm off! I wish you luck!\" and Ida Bridge  fled to the region of her own classroom, with a grin on her impish  face.    Though she might rail at the impudence of the small fry, Gwen was not  above taking a hint--headmistresses do not lightly brook being kept  waiting--so she started at a run up the passage, turning over in her  mind every possible crime which she might unwittingly have committed.    \"Can't remember using the front gate, or not changing my boots, or  talking on the stairs, or--oh, wow! Here I am at the library! Well,  whatever I've done, I suppose I'm in for it now! I hope she won't  absolutely wither me up!\"    So far from looking withering as Gwen entered the room, the Principal  wore an unusually encouraging and benign expression. She was a  handsome, large, imposing woman, with a stern cast of features, and  was held in great awe by the whole school. As a rule, Seniors and  Juniors quailed alike under the glance of her keen dark eyes.    \"Come here, Gwen,\" she said blandly, as her pupil stood hesitating  near the door. \"I want to have a little talk with you. I've been  looking over your reports for the last few weeks, and I find that  you've done well--so well, that I consider the standard of the Upper  Fourth is too easy for you. I think you ought to be able to manage the  work of the Fifth Form, and I'm going to move you there.\"    Gwen stared at Miss Roscoe, too surprised to answer. Such a proposal  as a change of Form was absolutely the last thing she could have  expected. In the middle of a term it was surely an unprecedented  happening. For the moment she scarcely knew whether to be alarmed or  flattered at the honour thus thrust upon her.    \"You may find the mathematics a little difficult,\" continued Miss  Roscoe; \"but Miss Woodville shall coach you until you've caught up the  rest of the class. She can also go over the arrears of Latin  translation with you. With that help you shouldn't be so far behind.  I've spoken to both Miss Slade and Miss Douglas about it, and they  fully agree with me. Do you think yourself you'll be able to manage  the work?\"    \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" stammered Gwen. \"I expect I'm behind in  maths.--but--\"    \"But you must try your best. I shall trust you to make a great effort.  I should be very sorry to have to put you down again. Come with me  now, and I'll take you to your new Form.\"    Gwen followed the Principal with her head in a buzzing whirl. It  seemed like a dream to be suddenly translated from the Lower School to  the Upper. She wished she could have had a little time to get  accustomed to the idea: she would have liked a day's preparation at  least, so as to think the change over and discuss it at home. Miss  Roscoe, however, always did things in a hurry; she never had a moment  to waste, and at present she whisked her pupil along the corridor and  into the Fifth Form room with almost breathless energy.    \"Here's Gwen Gascoyne, Miss Douglas,\" she announced. \"We'll try if she  can manage the work, and I've arranged with Miss Woodville to give her  the extra coaching we spoke about. She can bring her books from her  old classroom at eleven.\"    Thus saying, she bustled away to take a history lecture, leaving the  new member of the Fifth standing in much embarrassment. The eyes of  every girl in the room naturally were glued upon Gwen, who felt  herself twitching with nervousness under the scrutiny; but Miss  Douglas motioned her to an empty desk in the back row, and went on  with the lesson as if nothing had happened. I am afraid Gwen was too  agitated to absorb much knowledge that morning. She had not brought  notebook or pencil with her, and though at Miss Douglas's request her  neighbour rather ungraciously lent her a sheet of paper and a stump of  pencil, the notes which she took were scrappy and inadequate. She kept  stealing peeps at the other girls, but turning away when she met the  anything but friendly glances directed at her. The teacher asked her  one or two questions, then, seeing that she did not quite grasp the  subject, kindly ignored her.    \"Talk of a fish out of water,\" thought Gwen; \"I feel like an eel in a  frying pan. I believe these girls are going to be detestable. I shall  have to look out for squalls.\"    Nor was she mistaken. At eleven o'clock the storm broke. Directly Miss  Douglas had left the room for the interval the seventeen members of  the Fifth turned upon the newcomer.    \"What are you doing here, Gwen Gascoyne, I'd like to know?\" demanded  Edith Arnold, opening the attack.    \"We don't want any Fourth Form girls foisted on us!\" proclaimed Rachel  Hunter.    \"You don't belong to the Upper School!\" urged Charlotte Perry hotly.    \"I didn't yesterday, but I do now,\" retorted Gwen. \"Miss Roscoe's  moved me up. Yes--and I mean to stay here, too!\" she added, facing her  opponents stubbornly.    \"Miss Roscoe must be mad!\"    \"What can she be thinking of?\"    \"Better go and ask her yourself,\" said Gwen, \"if you think she's  likely to listen to you. She isn't generally very ready to enter into  explanations.\"    \"But this is monstrous! It's an unheard-of thing!\" exclaimed Louise  Mawson excitedly. \"A chit like you to be brought into the Fifth! Why,  how old are"]]]
