[Condensed from Nature.]      There has recently been a most interesting discussion at the Literary  and Philosophical Society, Manchester, on the above subject.    The paper which gave rise to the discussion was by Mr. Brockbank, who  detailed many experiments, and ended by stating his opinion that iron  does become much weaker, both in its cast and wrought states, under  the influence of low temperature; but Mr. Brockbank's paper was  immediately followed by others by Sir W. Fairbairn, Dr. Joule, and Mr.  Spence, which at once put an entirely new complexion on the matter.    Dr. Joule says:    \"As is usual in a severe frost, we have recently heard of many severe  accidents consequent upon the fracture of the tires of the wheels of  railway carriages. The common-sense explanation of these accidents is,  that the ground being harder than usual, the metal with which it  is brought into contact is more severely tried than in ordinary  circumstances. In order apparently to excuse certain railway  companies, a pretence has been set up that iron and steel become  brittle at a low temperature. This pretence, although put forth in  defiance, not only of all we know, of the properties of materials, but  also of the experience of everyday life, has yet obtained the credence  of so many people that I thought it would be useful to make the  following simple experiments:    \"1st. A freezing mixture of salt and snow was placed on a table. Wires  of steel and of iron were stretched, so that a part of them was in  contact with the freezing mixture and another part out of it. In every  case I tried the wire broke outside of the mixture, showing that it  was weaker at 50 deg. F., than at about 12 deg. F.    \"2d. I took twelve darning needles of good quality, 3 in. long, 1/24  in. thick. The ends of these were placed against steel props, 2-1/8  in. asunder. In making an experiment, a wire was fastened to  the middle of a needle, the other end being attached to a spring  weighing-machine. This was then pulled until the needle gave way. Six  of the needles, taken at random, were tried at a temperature of 55 deg.  F., and the remaining six in a freezing mixture which brought down  their temperature to 12 deg. F. The results were as follow:--            Warm Needles.          Cold Needles.           64 ounces broke        55 ounces broke           65   \"      \"          64   \"      \"           55   \"      \"          72   \"      \"           62   \"      \"          60   \"    bent           44   \"      \"          68   \"    broke           60   \"    bent         40   \"      \"           ---                    ---  Average, 58-1/3        Average, 59-5/6    \"I did not notice any perceptible difference in the perfection of  elasticity in the two sets of needles. The result, as far as it goes,  is in favor of the cold metal.    \"3d. The above are doubtless decisive of the question at issue. But  as it might be alleged that the violence to which a railway wheel is  subjected is more akin to a blow than a steady pull; and as, moreover,  the pretended brittleness is attributed more to cast iron than any  other description of the metal, I have made yet another kind of  experiment. I got a quantity of cast iron garden nails, an inch and  a quarter long and 1/8 in. thick in the middle. These I weighed,  and selected such as were nearly of the same weight. I then arranged  matters so that by removing a prop I could cause the blunt edge of a  steel chisel weighted to 4lb. 2oz., to fall from a given height upon  the middle of the nail as it was supported from each end, 1-1/16 in.  asunder. In order to secure the absolute fairness of the trials, the  nails were taken at random, and an experiment with a cold nail was  always alternated with one at the ordinary temperature. The nails to  be cooled were placed in a mixture of salt and snow, from which they  were removed and struck with the hammer in less than 5\".\"    The collective result of the experiments, the details of which need  not be given, was that 21 cold nails broke and 20 warm ones.    Dr. Joule adds, \"The experiments of Lavoisier and Laplace, of Smeaton,  of Dulong and Petit, and of Troughton, conspire in giving a less  expansion by heat to steel than iron, especially if the former be in  an untempered state; but this, would in certain limits have the effect  of strengthening rather than of weakening an iron wheel with a tire of  steel.    \"The general conclusion is this: Frost does _not_ make either iron  (cast or wrought), or steel, brittle.    Mr. Spence, in his experiments, decided on having some lengths of  cast iron made of a uniform thickness of 1/2 in. square, from the same  metal and the same mould.    He writes:--\"Two of the four castings I got seemed to be good ones,  and I got the surface taken off, and made them as regular a thickness  as was practicable.    \"I then fixed two knife-edged wedges upon the surface of a plank, at  exactly nine inches distance from each other, with an opening in the  plank in the intervening space, the bar being laid across the wedges,  a knife-edged hook was hung in the middle of the suspended piece of  the bar, and to the hook was hung a large scale on which to place  weights.    \"The bar was tried first at a temperature of 60 deg. F.; to find the  breaking weight I placed 56lb. weights one after another on the scale,  and when the ninth was put on the bar snapped. This was the only  unsatisfactory experiment, as 14 or 28lb. might have done it, but I  include it among others. I now adopted another precaution, by placing  the one end of the plank on a fixed point and the other end on to a  screw-jack, by raising which I could, without any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19192"],[0,"What is Darwinism?

This is a question which needs an answer. Great confusion and diversity  of opinion prevail as to the real views of the man whose writings have  agitated the whole world, scientific and religious. If a man says he is  a Darwinian, many understand him to avow himself virtually an atheist;  while another understands him as saying that he adopts some harmless  form of the doctrine of evolution. This is a great evil.    It is obviously useless to discuss any theory until we are agreed as to  what that theory is. The question, therefore, What is Darwinism? must  take precedence of all discussion of its merits.    The great fact of experience is that the universe exists. The great  problem which has ever pressed upon the human mind is to account for its  existence. What was its origin? To what causes are the changes we  witness around us to be referred? As we are a part of the universe,  these questions concern ourselves. What are the origin, nature, and  destiny of man? Professor Huxley is right in saying, \"The question of  questions for mankind--the problem which underlies all others, and is  more interesting than any other--is the ascertainment of the place which  Man occupies in nature and of his relation to the universe of things.  Whence our race has come, what are the limits of our power over nature,  and of nature's power over us, to what goal are we tending, are the  problems which present themselves anew and with undiminished interest to  every man born into the world.\"[1] Mr. Darwin undertakes to answer these  questions. He proposes a solution of the problem which thus deeply  concerns every living man. Darwinism is, therefore, a theory of the  universe, at least so far as the living organisms on this earth are  concerned. This being the case, it may be well to state, in few words,  the other prevalent theories on this great subject, that the points of  agreement and of difference between them and the views of Mr. Darwin may  be the more clearly seen.      _The Scriptural Solution of the Problem of the Universe_.    That solution is stated in words equally simple and sublime: \"In the  beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" We have here, first,  the idea of God. The word God has in the Bible a definite meaning. It  does not stand for an abstraction, for mere force, for law or ordered  sequence. God is a spirit, and as we are spirits, we know from  consciousness that God is, (1.) A Substance; (2.) That He is a person;  and, therefore, a self-conscious, intelligent, voluntary agent. He can  say I; we can address Him as Thou; we can speak of Him as He or Him.  This idea of God pervades the Scriptures. It lies at the foundation of  natural religion. It is involved in our religious consciousness. It  enters essentially into our sense of moral obligation. It is inscribed  ineffaceably, in letters more or less legible, on the heart of every  human being. The man who is trying to be an atheist is trying to free  himself from the laws of his being. He might as well try to free himself  from liability to hunger or thirst.    The God of the Bible, then, is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and  unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, goodness, and truth.  As every theory must begin with some postulate, this is the grand  postulate with which the Bible begins. This is the first point.    The second point concerns the origin of the universe. It is not eternal  either as to matter or form. It is not independent of God. It is not an  evolution of his being, or his existence form. He is extramundane as  well as antemundane. The universe owes its existence to his will.    Thirdly, as to the nature of the universe; it is not a mere phenomenon.  It is an entity, having real objective existence, or actuality. This  implies that matter is a substance endowed with certain properties, in  virtue of which it is capable of acting and of being acted upon. These  properties being uniform and constant, are physical laws to which, as  their proximate causes, all the phenomena of nature are to be referred.    Fourthly, although God is extramundane, He is nevertheless everywhere  present. That presence is not only a presence of essence, but also of  knowledge and power. He upholds all things. He controls all physical  causes, working through them, with them, and without them, as He sees  fit. As we, in our limited spheres, can use physical causes to  accomplish our purposes, so God everywhere and always cooeperates with  them to accomplish his infinitely wise and merciful designs.    Fifthly, man a part of the universe, is, according to the Scriptures, as  concerns his body, of the earth. So far, he belongs to the animal  kingdom. As to his soul, he is a child of God, who is declared to be the  Father of the spirits of all men. God is a spirit, and we are spirits.  We are, therefore, of the same nature with God. We are God-like; so that  in knowing ourselves we know God. No man conscious of his manhood can be  ignorant of his relationship to God as his Father.    The truth of this theory of the universe rests, in the first place, so  far as it has been correctly stated, on the infallible authority of the  Word of God. In the second place, it is a satisfactory solution of the  problem to be solved,--(1.) It accounts for the origin of the universe.  (2.) It accounts for all the universe contains, and gives a satisfactory  explanation of the marvellous contrivances which abound in living  organisms, of the adaptations of these organisms to conditions external  to themselves, and for those provisions for the future, which on any  other assumption are utterly inexplicable. (3.) It is in conflict with  no truth of reason and with no fact of experience.[2] (4.) The  Scriptural doctrine accounts for the spiritual nature of man, and meets  all his spiritual necessities. It gives him an object of adoration,  love, and confidence. It reveals the Being on whom his indestructible  sense of responsibility terminates. The truth of this doctrine,  therefore, rests not only on the authority of the Scriptures, but on the  very constitution of our nature. The Bible has little charity for those  who reject it. It pronounces them to be either derationalized or  demoralized, or both.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] _Evidences of Man's Place in Nature._ London, 1864, p. 57.
