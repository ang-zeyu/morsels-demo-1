November 1899_    _Reprinted, December 1899_          TO    THE COMPANION OF MY JOURNEY          PREFATORY CHAPTER      This new edition has been carefully revised throughout, and, as far as  possible, brought up to date by noting, in their proper places, the  chief events of importance that have occurred since the book first  appeared. In the historical chapters, however, and in those which deal  with recent politics, no changes have been made save such as were needed  for the correction of one or two slight errors of fact, and for the  mention of new facts, later in date than the first edition. I have left  the statements of my own views exactly as they were first written, even  where I thought that the form of a statement might be verbally improved,  not only because I still adhere to those views, but also because I  desire it to be clearly understood that they were formed and expressed  before the events of the last few months, and without any reference to  the controversies of the moment.    When the first edition of the book was published (at the end of 1897)  there was strong reason to believe as well as to hope that a race  conflict in South Africa would be avoided, and that the political  problems it presents, acute as they had become early in 1896, would be  solved in a peaceable way. To this belief and hope I gave expression in  the concluding chapter of the book, indicating \"tact, coolness and  patience, above all, patience,\" as the qualities needed to attain that  result which all friends of the country must unite in desiring.    Now, however, (October 1899), Britain and her South African Colonies and  territories find themselves at war with the South African Republic and  the Orange Free State. A new chapter is opened in the history of the  country which completely alters the situation, and must necessarily  leave things very different from what it found them. Readers of this new  edition may reasonably expect to find in it some account of the events  which have within the last two years led up to this catastrophe, or at  any rate some estimate of that conduct of affairs by the three  governments concerned which has brought about a result all three ought  to have sought to avert.    There are, however, conclusive reasons against attempting to continue  down to the outbreak of the war (October 11th) the historical sketch  given in Chapters II to XII. The materials for the historian are still  scanty and imperfect, leaving him with data scarcely sufficient for  judging the intention and motives with which some things were done.  Round the acts and words of the representatives of the three governments  concerned, there rages such a storm of controversy, that whoever places  a particular construction upon those acts and words must need support  his construction by citations from documents and arguments based on  those citations. To do this would need a space much larger than I can  command. The most serious difficulty, however, is that when events are  close to us and excite strong feelings, men distrust the impartiality of  a historian even when he does his best to be impartial. I shall not,  therefore, attempt to write a history of the last two fateful years, but  content myself first, with calling the reader's attention to a few  salient facts that have occurred since 1896, and to some aspects of the  case which have been little considered in England; and secondly, with  describing as clearly and estimating as cautiously as I can, the forces  that have worked during those years with such swift and deadly effect.    Some of these facts may be dismissed with a word or two, because they  lie outside the present crisis. One is the entrance of the Colony of  Natal into the South African Customs Union, an event which created one  uniform tariff system for the whole of British and Dutch South Africa  except the Transvaal. Another is the extension of the two great lines of  railway from the coast into the interior. This extension has given  Bulawayo and Matabililand a swift and easy communication with Cape Town,  thereby strengthening immensely the hold of Britain upon the interior,  and lessening any risk that might be feared of future native risings. It  has also opened up a new and quick route from the coast of the Indian  Ocean at Beira into the heart of Mashonaland, and brought the  construction of a railway from Mashonaland across the Zambesi to Lake  Tanganyika within the horizon of practicable enterprises. A scheme of  government has been settled for the territories of the British South  Africa Company south of the Zambesi (Southern Rhodesia), which is now  at work. The prospects of gold mining in that region are believed to  have improved, and the increase of gold production in the mines of the  Witwatersrand has proved even more rapid than was expected in 1896. An  agreement has been concluded between Britain and the German Empire  relating to their interests on the coast of the Indian Ocean, which,  though its terms have not been disclosed, is generally understood to  have removed an obstacle which might have been feared to the acquisition  by Britain of such rights at Delagoa Bay as she may be able to obtain  from Portugal, and to have withdrawn from the South African Republic any  hope that State might have cherished of support from Germany in the  event of a breach with Britain.    These events, however, great as is their bearing on the future, are of  less present moment than those which have sprung from Dr. Jameson's  expedition into the Transvaal in December, 1895, and the internal  troubles in that State which caused and accompanied his enterprise. It  rekindled race feeling all over South Africa, and has had the most  disastrous effects upon every part of the country. To understand these  effects it is necessary to understand the state of opinion in the  British Colonies and in the two Republics before it took place. Let us  examine these communities separately.    In Cape Colony and Natal there was before December, 1895, no hostility  at all between the British and the Dutch elements. Political parties in  Cape Colony were, in a broad sense, British and Dutch, but the  distinction was really based not so much on racial differences as on  economic interests. The rural element which desired a protective tariff  and laws regulating native labour, was mainly Dutch, the commercial  element almost wholly British. Mr. Rhodes, the embodiment of British  Imperialism, was Prime Minister through the support of the Dutch element  and the Africander Bond. Englishmen and Dutchmen were everywhere in the  best social relations. The old blood sympathy of the Dutch element for  the Transvaal Boers which had been so strongly manifested in 1881, when  the latter were struggling for their independence, had been superseded,  or at least thrown into the background, by displeasure at the  unneighbourly policy of the Transvaal Government in refusing public  employment to Cape Dutchmen as well as to Englishmen, and in throwing  obstacles in the way of trade in agricultural products. This displeasure  culminated when the Transvaal Government, in the summer of 1895, closed  the Drifts (fords) on the Vaal River, to the detriment of imports from  the Colony and the Orange Free State.    In the Orange Free State there was, as has been pointed out in Chapter  XIX., perfect good feeling and cordial co-operation in all public  matters between the Dutch and the English elements. There was also  perfect friendliness to Britain, the old grievances of the Diamond  Fields dispute (see page 144) and of the arrest of the Free State  conquest of Basutoland having been virtually forgotten. Towards the  Transvaal there was a political sympathy based partly on kinship, partly  on a similarity of republican institutions. But there was also some  annoyance at the policy which the Transvaal Government, and especially  its Hollander advisers, were pursuing; coupled with a desire to see  reforms effected in the Transvaal, and the franchise granted to  immigrants on more liberal terms.    Of the Transvaal itself I need say the less, because its condition is  fully described in Chapter XXV. There was of course much irritation  among the Uitlanders of English and Colonial stock, with an arrogant  refusal on the part of the ruling section and the more extreme  old-fashioned Boers to admit the claims of these new-comers. But there  was also a party among the burghers, important more by the character and  ability of its members than by its numbers, yet growing in influence,  which desired reform, perceived that the existing state of things could  not continue, and was ready to join the Uitlanders in agitating for  sweeping changes in the Constitution and in administration.    The events of December, 1895, changed the face of things swiftly and  decisively in all these communities.    In Cape Colony Dutch feeling, which as a political force was almost  expiring, revived at once. The unexpected attack on the Transvaal  evolved an outburst of sympathy for it, in which the faults of its  government were forgotten. Mr. Rhodes retired from office. The  reconstructed Ministry which succeeded fell in 1898, and a new Ministry  supported by the Africander Bond came into power after a general  election. Its majority was narrow, and was accused of not fairly  representing the country, owing to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],[0,"A Damsel in Distress (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Note for edition 11: in para. 4 of Chapter 19, the  word \"leafy\" has been changed to \"leaky\". \"leafy\" was the word used  in the printed edition, but was an obvious misprint.

Inasmuch as the scene of this story is that historic pile, Belpher  Castle, in the county of Hampshire, it would be an agreeable task  to open it with a leisurely description of the place, followed by  some notes on the history of the Earls of Marshmoreton, who have  owned it since the fifteenth century. Unfortunately, in these days  of rush and hurry, a novelist works at a disadvantage. He must  leap into the middle of his tale with as little delay as he would  employ in boarding a moving tramcar. He must get off the mark with  the smooth swiftness of a jack-rabbit surprised while lunching.  Otherwise, people throw him aside and go out to picture palaces.    I may briefly remark that the present Lord Marshmoreton is a  widower of some forty-eight years: that he has two children--a son,  Percy Wilbraham Marsh, Lord Belpher, who is on the brink of his  twenty-first birthday, and a daughter, Lady Patricia Maud Marsh,  who is just twenty: that the chatelaine of the castle is Lady  Caroline Byng, Lord Marshmoreton's sister, who married the very  wealthy colliery owner, Clifford Byng, a few years before his death  (which unkind people say she hastened): and that she has a  step-son, Reginald. Give me time to mention these few facts and I  am done. On the glorious past of the Marshmoretons I will not even  touch.    Luckily, the loss to literature is not irreparable. Lord  Marshmoreton himself is engaged upon a history of the family, which  will doubtless be on every bookshelf as soon as his lordship gets  it finished. And, as for the castle and its surroundings, including  the model dairy and the amber drawing-room, you may see them for  yourself any Thursday, when Belpher is thrown open to the public on  payment of a fee of one shilling a head. The money is collected by  Keggs the butler, and goes to a worthy local charity. At least,  that is the idea. But the voice of calumny is never silent, and  there exists a school of thought, headed by Albert, the page-boy,  which holds that Keggs sticks to these shillings like glue, and  adds them to his already considerable savings in the Farmers' and  Merchants' Bank, on the left side of the High Street in Belpher  village, next door to the Oddfellows' Hall.    With regard to this, one can only say that Keggs looks far too much  like a particularly saintly bishop to indulge in any such practices.  On the other hand, Albert knows Keggs. We must leave the matter  open.    Of course, appearances are deceptive. Anyone, for instance, who had  been standing outside the front entrance of the castle at eleven  o'clock on a certain June morning might easily have made a mistake.  Such a person would probably have jumped to the conclusion that the  middle-aged lady of a determined cast of countenance who was  standing near the rose-garden, talking to the gardener and watching  the young couple strolling on the terrace below, was the mother of  the pretty girl, and that she was smiling because the latter had  recently become engaged to the tall, pleasant-faced youth at her  side.    Sherlock Holmes himself might have been misled. One can hear him  explaining the thing to Watson in one of those lightning flashes of  inductive reasoning of his. \"It is the only explanation, my dear  Watson. If the lady were merely complimenting the gardener on his  rose-garden, and if her smile were merely caused by the excellent  appearance of that rose-garden, there would be an answering smile  on the face of the gardener. But, as you see, he looks morose and  gloomy.\"    As a matter of fact, the gardener--that is to say, the stocky,  brown-faced man in shirt sleeves and corduroy trousers who was  frowning into a can of whale-oil solution--was the Earl of  Marshmoreton, and there were two reasons for his gloom. He hated to  be interrupted while working, and, furthermore, Lady Caroline Byng  always got on his nerves, and never more so than when, as now, she  speculated on the possibility of a romance between her step-son  Reggie and his lordship's daughter Maud.    Only his intimates would have recognized in this curious  corduroy-trousered figure the seventh Earl of Marshmoreton. The  Lord Marshmoreton who made intermittent appearances in London, who  lunched among bishops at the Athenaeum Club without exciting  remark, was a correctly dressed gentleman whom no one would have  suspected of covering his sturdy legs in anything but the finest  cloth. But if you will glance at your copy of Who's Who, and turn  up the \"M's\", you will find in the space allotted to the Earl the  words \"Hobby--Gardening\". To which, in a burst of modest pride, his  lordship has added \"Awarded first prize for Hybrid Teas, Temple  Flower Show, 1911\". The words tell their own story.    Lord Marshmoreton was the most enthusiastic amateur gardener in a  land of enthusiastic amateur gardeners. He lived for his garden.  The love which other men expend on their nearest and dearest Lord  Marshmoreton lavished on seeds, roses and loamy soil. The hatred  which some of his order feel for Socialists and Demagogues Lord  Marshmoreton kept for rose slugs, rose-beetles and the small,  yellowish-white insect which is so depraved and sinister a  character that it goes through life with an alias--being sometimes  called a rose-hopper and sometimes a thrip. A simple soul, Lord  Marshmoreton--mild and pleasant. Yet put him among the thrips, and  he became a dealer-out of death and slaughter, a destroyer in the  class of Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan. Thrips feed on the  underside of rose leaves, sucking their juice and causing them to  turn yellow; and Lord Marshmoreton's views on these things were so  rigid that he would have poured whale-oil solution on his  grandmother if he had found her on the underside of one of his rose  leaves sucking its juice.    The only time in the day when he ceased to be the horny-handed  toiler and became the aristocrat was in the evening after dinner,  when, egged on by Lady Caroline, who gave him no rest in the  matter--he would retire to his private study and work on his  History of the Family, assisted by his able secretary, Alice  Faraday. His progress on that massive work was, however, slow. Ten  hours in the open air make a man drowsy, and too often Lord  Marshmoreton would fall asleep in mid-sentence to the annoyance of  Miss Faraday, who was a conscientious girl and liked to earn her  salary.    The couple on the terrace had turned. Reggie Byng's face, as he  bent over Maud, was earnest and animated, and even from a distance  it was possible to see how the girl's eyes lit up at what he was  saying. She was hanging on his words. Lady Caroline's smile became  more and more benevolent.    \"They make a charming pair,\" she murmured. \"I wonder what dear  Reggie is saying. Perhaps at this very moment--\"    She broke off with a sigh of content. She had had her troubles over  this affair. Dear Reggie, usually so plastic in her hands, had  displayed an unaccountable reluctance to offer his agreeable self  to Maud--in spite of the fact that never, not even on the public  platform which she adorned so well, had his step-mother reasoned  more clearly than she did when pointing out to him the advantages  of the match. It was not that Reggie disliked Maud. He admitted  that she was a \"topper\", on several occasions going so far as to  describe her as \"absolutely priceless\". But he seemed reluctant to  ask her to marry him. How could Lady Caroline know that Reggie's  entire world--or such of it as was not occupied by racing cars and  golf--was filled by Alice Faraday? Reggie had never told her. He  had not even told Miss Faraday.    \"Perhaps at this very moment,\" went on Lady Caroline, \"the dear boy  is proposing to her.\"    Lord Marshmoreton grunted, and continued to peer with a questioning  eye in the awesome brew which he had prepared for the thrips.    \"One thing is very satisfactory,\" said Lady Caroline. \"I mean that  Maud seems entirely to have got over that ridiculous infatuation of  hers for that man she met in Wales last summer. She could not be so  cheerful if she were still brooding on that. I hope you will admit  now, John, that I was right in keeping her practically a prisoner  here and never allowing her a chance of meeting the man again  either by accident or design. They say absence makes the heart grow  fonder. Stuff! A girl of Maud's age falls in and out of love half a  dozen times a year. I feel sure she has almost forgotten the man by  now.\"    \"Eh?\" said Lord Marshmoreton. His mind had been far away, dealing  with green flies.    \"I was speaking about that man Maud met when she was staying with  Brenda in Wales.\"    \"Oh, yes!\"    \"Oh, yes!\" echoed Lady Caroline, annoyed. \"Is that the only comment  you can find to make? Your only daughter becomes infatuated with a  perfect stranger--a man we have never seen--of whom we know nothing,  not even his name--nothing except that he is an American and hasn't  a penny--Maud admitted that. And all you say is 'Oh, yes'!\"    \"But it's all over now, isn't it? I understood the dashed affair  was all over.\"    \"We hope so. But I should feel safer if Maud were engaged to  Reggie. I do think you might take the trouble to speak to Maud.\"    \"Speak to her? I do speak to her.\" Lord Marshmoreton's brain moved  slowly when he was pre-occupied with his roses. \"We're on  excellent terms.\"    Lady Caroline frowned impatiently. Hers was an alert, vigorous  mind,"]]]
