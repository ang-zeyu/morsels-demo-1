This guide will help you recognize birds on the wing--it  emphasizes their fall and winter plumage patterns as well as size,  shape, and flight characteristics. It does not include local names.    Recognizing the species of ducks and geese can be rewarding to  birdwatchers and hunters--and the ducks.    Hunters can contribute to their own sport by not firing at those species  that are either protected or scarce, and needed as breeders to restore  the flocks. It can add to their daily limit; when extra birds of certain  species can be taken legally, hunters who know their ducks on the wing  come out ahead.    Knowing a mallard from a merganser has another side: gourmets prefer a  corn-fed mallard to the fish duck.          What to Look For      Differences in size, shape, plumage patterns and colors, wing beat,  flocking behavior, voice, and habitat--all help to distinguish one  species from another.    Flock maneuvers in the air are clues. Mallards, pintails, and wigeon  form loose groups; teal and shovelers flash by in small, compact  bunches; at a distance, canvasbacks shift from waving lines to temporary  V's.    Closer up, individual silhouettes are important. Variations of head  shapes and sizes, lengths of wings and tails, and fat bodies or slim can  be seen.    Within shotgun range, color areas can be important. Light conditions  might make them look different, but their size and location are positive  keys. The sound of their wings can help as much as their calls. Flying  goldeneyes make a whistling sound; wood ducks move with a swish;  canvasbacks make a steady rushing sound. Not all ducks quack; many  whistle, squeal, or grunt.    Although not a hard and fast rule, different species tend to use  different types of habitat. Puddle ducks like shallow marshes and creeks  while divers prefer larger, deeper, and more open waters.          Eclipse Plumage      Most ducks shed their body feathers twice each year. Nearly all drakes  lose their bright plumage after mating, and for a few weeks resemble  females. This hen-like appearance is called the eclipse plumage. The  return to breeding coloration varies in species and individuals of each  species. Blue-winged teal and shovelers may retain the eclipse plumage  until well into the winter.    Wing feathers are shed only once a year; wing colors are always the  same.          Puddle Ducks      Puddle ducks are typically birds of fresh, shallow marshes and rivers  rather than of large lakes and bays. They are good divers, but usually  feed by dabbling or tipping rather than submerging.    The speculum, or colored wing patch, is generally iridescent and  bright, and often a telltale field mark.    Any duck feeding in croplands will likely be a puddle duck, for most of  this group are sure-footed and can walk and run well on land. Their diet  is mostly vegetable, and grain-fed mallards or pintails or  acorn-fattened wood ducks are highly regarded as food.          Mallard      Length--24\"  Weight--2-3/4 lbs.    The mallard is our most common duck, found in all flyways. The males are  often called \"greenheads.\" The main wintering area is the lower  Mississippi basin, and along the gulf coast, but many stay as far north  as open waters permits.    Flocks often feed in early morning and late afternoon in nearby  harvested fields, returning to marshes and creeks to spend the night.    The flight is not particularly rapid. Hens have a loud _quack_; the  drake's voice is a low-pitched _kwek-kwek_.          Pintail      Length--26\"  Weight--1-3/4 lbs.    These ducks use all four flyways, but are most plentiful in the west.    They are extremely graceful and fast fliers, fond of zig-zagging from  great heights before leveling off to land.    The long neck and tail make them appear longer than mallards, but in  body size and weight they are smaller.    They are agile on land and often feed in grain fields. The drakes  whistle; the hens have a coarse _quack_.          Gadwall      Length--21\"  Weight--2 lbs.    Gadwalls are most numerous in the Central Flyway, but not too common  anywhere. They are often called \"gray mallards\" or \"gray ducks.\" They  are one of the earliest migrants, seldom facing cold weather.    They are the only puddle ducks with a white speculum.    Small, compact flocks fly swiftly, usually in a direct line. Wingbeats  are rapid.    Drakes whistle and _kack-kack_; hens _quack_ like a mallard, but softer.          Wigeon      Length--21\"  Weight--1-3/4 lbs.    These are nervous birds, quick to take alarm. Their flight is fast,  irregular, with many twists and turns. In a bunched flock, their  movements have been compared to those of pigeons.    When open water is handy, wigeons often raft up offshore until late  afternoon when they move to marshes and ponds to feed.    The white belly and forewing are very showy in the air. Drakes whistle;  hens have a loud _kaow_ and a lower _qua-awk_.          Shoveler      Length--19-1/2\"  Weight--1-1/2 lbs.    Shovelers, 'spoonbills' to many, are early migrants, moving out at the  first frost. The largest numbers are in the Central and Pacific flyways.    The usual flight is steady and direct. When startled, the small flocks  twist and turn in the air like teal.    They are not highly regarded as table birds, because one third of the  usual diet is animal matter.    Drakes call _woh-woh_ and _took-took_; the hen's _quack_ is feeble.          Blue-Winged Teal      Length--16\"  Weight--15 oz.    Their small size and twisting turning flight gives the illusion of great  speed. The small, compact flocks commonly fly low over the marshes, and  often take the hunter by surprise.    They are more vocal than most ducks--their high-pitched peeping and  nasal quacking is commonly heard in spring and to a lesser extent in  fall.    These teal are among the first ducks to migrate each fall, and one of  the last in the spring.          Cinnamon Teal      In the Pacific Flyway, cinnamon teal are far more common than  blue-wings. The hens look alike and the habits of both species are  similar.    The pale blue forewing patch is the best field mark, as drakes are  usually in eclipse until January or longer.    Drakes have a whistling _peep_; hens utter a low _quack_.          Green-Winged Teal      Length--15 in.  Weight--14 oz.    Quite hardy--some birds stay as far north as open water is found.    The smallest and one of the most common of our ducks. Their tiny size  gives the impression of great speed, but mallards can fly faster. Their  flight is often low, erratic, with the entire flock twisting and turning  as one unit.    They nest as far north as Alaska, and migrate in all four flyways. Early  fall drakes are usually still in full eclipse plumage.    Drakes whistle and twitter; hens have a slight _quack_.          Wood Duck      Length--18-1/2 in.  Weight--1-1/2 lbs.    Found in all flyways; most numerous in the Atlantic and Mississippi  flyways and fewest in the Central.    They are early migrants; most of them have left the northern States by  mid-November.    Frequents wooded streams and ponds; perches in trees. Flies through  thick timber with speed and ease and often feeds on acorns, berries, and  grapes on the forest floors.    Flight is swift and direct; flocks are usually small.    In the air, their wings make a rustling, swishing sound. Drakes call  _hoo-w-ett_, often in flight; hens have a _cr-r-ek_ when frightened.          Black Duck      Length--24 in.  Weight--2-3/4 lbs.    A bird of the eastern States, primarily the Atlantic Flyway and, to a  lesser extent, the Mississippi.    Shy and wary, regarded as the wariest of all ducks.    Often seen in company of mallards, but along the Atlantic coast  frequents the salt marshes and ocean much more than mallards.    Flight is swift, usually in small flocks.    White wing lining in contrast to very dark body plumage is a good  identification clue.    The hen's _quack_ and the drake's _kwek-kwek_ are duplicates of the  mallards.          Diving Ducks      Diving ducks frequent the larger, deeper lakes and rivers, and coastal  bays and inlets.    The colored wing patches of these birds lack the brilliance of the  speculums of puddle ducks. Since many of them have short tails, their  huge, paddle feet may be used as rudders in flight, and are often  visible on flying birds. When launching into flight, most of this group  patter along the water before becoming airborne.    They feed by diving, often to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: Dot and the Kangaroo]             *       *       *       *       *          _Australian Publications._      CONRAD MARTENS, THE MAN AND HIS ART.

She knew it, and was very  frightened.    She was too frightened in fact to cry, but stood in the middle of a  little dry, bare space, looking around her at the scraggy growths of  prickly shrubs that had torn her little dress to rags, scratched her  bare legs and feet till they bled, and pricked her hands and arms as  she had pushed madly through the bushes, for hours, seeking her home.  Sometimes she looked up to the sky. But little of it could be seen  because of the great tall trees that seemed to her to be trying to reach  heaven with their far-off crooked branches. She could see little patches  of blue sky between the tangled tufts of drooping leaves, and, as the  dazzling sunlight had faded, she began to think it was getting late, and  that very soon it would be night.    The thought of being lost and alone in the wild bush at night, took her  breath away with fear, and made her tired little legs tremble under her.  She gave up all hope of finding her home, and sat down at the foot of  the biggest blackbutt tree, with her face buried in her hands and knees,  and thought of all that had happened, and what might happen yet.    It seemed such a long, long time since her mother had told her that she  might gather some bush flowers whilst she cooked the dinner, and Dot  recollected how she was bid not to go out of sight of the cottage. How  she wished now that she had remembered this sooner! But whilst she was  picking the pretty flowers, a hare suddenly started at her feet and  sprang away into the bush, and she had run after it. When she found that  she could not catch the hare, she discovered that she could no longer  see the cottage. After wandering for a while she got frightened and ran,  and ran, little knowing that she was going further away from her home at  every step.    Where she was sitting under the blackbutt tree, she was miles away from  her father's selection, and it would be very difficult for anyone to  find her. She felt that she was a long way off, and she began to think  of what was happening at home. She remembered how, not very long ago, a  neighbour's little boy had been lost, and how his mother had come to  their cottage for help to find him, and that her father had ridden off"]]]
