A wolf there was, whose scanty fare  Had made his person lean and spare;  A dog there was, so amply fed,  His sides were plump and sleek; 'tis said  The wolf once met this prosp'rous cur,  And thus began: \"Your servant, sir;  I'm pleased to see you look so well,  Though how it is I cannot tell;  I have not broke my fast to-day;  Nor have I, I'm concern'd to say,  One bone in store or expectation,  And that I call a great vexation.\"    \"Indeed it is,\" the dog replied:  \"I know no ill so great beside;  But if you do not like to be  So poorly fed, come live with me.\"  \"Agreed,\" rejoined the wolf, \"I'll go:  But pray, what work am I to do?\"  \"Oh, guard the house, and do not fail  To bark at thieves, and wag your tail.\"    So off they jogg'd, and soon arrived  At where the friendly mastiff lived.  \"Well,\" said the wolf, \"I can't deny  You have a better house than I.\"  \"Not so,\" the other then replied,  \"If you with me will hence abide.\"  \"Oh,\" said the wolf, \"how kind you are!  But what d'ye call _that_, hanging there?  Is it an iron chain, or what?\"  \"Friend,\" said the dog, \"I quite forgot  To mention that; sometimes, you see,  They hook that little chain to _me_;  But it is only meant to keep  Us dogs from walking in our sleep,  And should you wear it, you would find,  It's nothing that you need to mind.\"    \"I'll take your word,\" the wolf replied.  \"It's truth by me shall ne'er be tried;  I'll have my liberty again,  And you your collar and your chain.\"      MORAL.    Our neighbors sometimes seem to be  A vast deal better off than we;  Yet seldom 'tis they really are,  Since _they_ have troubles too to bear,  Which, if the truth were really known,  Are quite as grievous as our own.          [Illustration]    THE HERDSMAN.      A herdsman, who lived at a time and a place  Which, should you not know, is but little disgrace,  Discover'd one morning, on counting his stock,  That a sheep had been stolen that night from the flock.    \"Oh, I wish I had caught ye, _whoever ye be_  I'd have soon let you know, I'd have soon let ye see,  What he had to expect,\" said the herdsman, \"I trow;  But I've thought of a scheme that will trouble you now.\"    So what did he do, sir, but put up a board,  Describing the thief, and proposed a reward  Of a lamb, to the man who would give information  Concerning the thief, and his true designation.    The project succeeded; for soon there applied  A certain near neighbor, with others beside.  \"But tell me the thief,\" said the herdsman, \"at least;\"  \"Come hither,\" said they, \"and we'll show you the beast!\"    \"The _beast_!\" said the rustic, who thought he should die on  The spot, when he found that the thief was a lion!  \"Ill luck to my hurry, what now shall I do?  I promised a lamb to detect you 'tis true;  But now I'd consent _all_ my substance to pay,  If I could but with safety get out of your way.\"      MORAL.    Silly people ask things that would ruin, if sent;  They demand them in haste, and at leisure repent.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE BOYS AND THE FROGS.      Some boys, beside a pond or lake,  Were playing once at _duck and drake?_  When, doubtless to their heart's content,  Volleys of stones were quickly sent.    But there were some (there will be such)  Who did not seem amused so much;  These were the frogs, to whom the game,  In point of sport was not the same.    For scarce a stone arrived, 'tis said,  But gave some frog a broken head;  And scores in less than half an hour,  Perished beneath the dreadful shower.    At last, said one, \"You silly folks, I say,  Do fling your stones another way;  Though _sport_ to _you_, to throw them thus,  Remember, pray, 'tis _death_ to us!\"      MORAL.    From hence this moral may be learn'd:  Let play _be play_ to _all concern'd_.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE COCK AND THE JEWEL.      A cock there was: a sage was he    (If Esop we may trust,)  Who wish'd to make a meal, you see,    As other sages must.    With this intent, as heretofore,    When on the hunt for grain;  Our hero scratch'd the litter o'er    With all his might and main.    But scarce a minute had he scratch'd,    When, to his great surprise,  A gem, with golden chain attach'd,    He saw with both his eyes.    \"Alack!\" quoth he, \"what have we here?    A diamond, I protest!  Which lords and ladies buy so dear,    And hold in such request.    \"But one good barley-corn to me    Has more intrinsic worth  Than all the pearls now in the sea,    Or gold now in the earth.\"      MORAL.    The moral here, in Esop's mind,    Was this, there's not a doubt:  Things have _most_ value, which we find    We _cannot_ do without.          [Illustration]    THE MAN AND THE LION.      A man and a lion once had a dispute,  Which was reckon'd the greatest, the man or the brute;  The lion discoursed on his side at some length,  And greatly enlarged on his courage and strength.    The man, one would think, had enough to reply  On _his_ side the question, which none could deny;  But like many others who make a pretence,  He talk'd perfect nonsense, and thought it good sense.    \"So,\" says he, \"don't be prating,--look yonder, I pray,  At that sculpture of marble, now what will you say?  The lion is vanquished; but as for the man  He is striding upon him; deny it who can.\"    \"But pray,\" said the lion, \"who sculptured that stone?\"  \"One of _us_,\" said the man, \"I must candidly own.\"  \"But when _we_ are sculptors,\" the other replied,  \"You will then on the man see the _lion_ astride.\"      MORAL.    The man might have added, if he had been wise,  \"But a beast _cannot_ sculpture a stone, _if he tries_.\"  _That_ sufficiently shows where the difference lies.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FOX AND THE CRANE.      \"I certainly think,\" said a fox to a crane,  \"That face, ma'am of yours is remarkably plain;  That beak that you wear is so frightful a feature,  It makes you appear a most singular creature.\"  The crane, much offended at what she had heard,  March'd off at full speed, without saying a word:  \"Oh dear!\" said the fox, \"Mrs. Crane, I protest  You misunderstand me, 'twas only a jest.\"  \"Come, don't be affronted--stay with me and dine;  You know very well 'tis this temper of mine  To say such odd things to my intimate friends;  But you know that poor Reynard no mischief intends.\"  So the crane thought it best not to break with him quite,  But to view his remarks in a good-natured light.  So she put on as pleasant a face as she could  When he ask'd her to dine, and replied that she would.  But alas! she perceived that his jokes were not over,  When Reynard removed from the victuals its cover  'Twas neither game, butcher's meat, chicken, not fish;  But plain gravy-soup, in a broad shallow dish.  Now this the fox lapp'd with his tongue very quick,  While the crane could scarce dip in the point of her beak;  \"You make a poor dinner,\" said he to his guest;  \"Oh, dear! by no means,\" said the bird, \"I protest.\"  But the crane ask'd the fox on a subsequent day,  When nothing, it seems, for their dinner had they  But some minced meat served up in a narrow-neck'd jar;  Too long, and narrow, for Reynard by far.  \"You make a poor dinner, I fear,\" said the bird;  \"Why, I think,\" said the fox, \"'twould be very absurd  To deny what you say, yet I cannot complain,  But confess, though a fox, that I'm matched by a crane.\"      MORAL.    Cunning folks who play tricks which good manners condemn,  Often find their own tricks play'd again upon them.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE TRAVELLER AND THE SATYR.      A luckless wight, in winter slow,  Travelling once a forest through  Cold and hungry, tired and wet,  Began in words like these to fret:  \"Oh, what a sharp inclement day!  And what a dismal, dreary way!  No friendly cot, no cheering fields,  No food this howling forest yields;  I've nought in store or expectation!  There's nought before me but starvation.\"    \"Not quite so bad,\" a voice replied;  Quickly the traveller turned aside,  And saw the satyr of the wood,  Who close beside his dwelling stood.  \"Here is my cave hard by,\" said he,  \"Walk in, you're welcome, pray be free.\"    The traveller did not hesitate,  Hoping for something good to eat,  But follow'd to his heart's content,  Blowing his finger as he went.    \"Pray,\" said the satyr, \"may I know  For what you blow your fingers so?\"    \"What! need you,\" said the man, \"be told?--  To _warm_ my fingers, 'numb'd with cold.\"    \"Indeed!\" was all his host replied,  Intent some pottage to provide,  Which heated well, with spice infused,  Was to his shivering guest produced:    So hot it was, as Esop sung,  It made our traveller scald his tongue;  And wishing not again to do it,  Our hero could not wait, but blew it.    \"What?\" said his host, in accent rough,  \"Is not your pottage hot enough?\"  \"Yes,\" said the man, \"full well I know it,  'Tis far too hot, that's why I blow it.\"  \"You artful villain! do you so?\"  His host replied, with angry brow;  \"My cave shall not a moment hold  A man that blows both hot and cold!  By none but rogues can that be done,  You double-dealing wretch, begone!\"      MORAL.

SHUCKBURGH, M.A.    LATE FELLOW OF EMMANUEL COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE  AUTHOR OF A TRANSLATION OF POLYBIUS, A HISTORY OF ROME, ETC      IN FOUR VOLUMES    VOL. I. B.C. 68-52      LONDON  GEORGE BELL AND SONS  1899      CHISWICK PRESS:--CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO.  TOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON.          PREFACE      The object of this book is to give the English-speaking public, in a  convenient form, as faithful and readable a copy as the translator was  capable of making of a document unique in the literature of antiquity.  Whether we regard the correspondence of Cicero from the point of view of  the biographer and observer of character, the historian, or the lover of  _belles lettres_, it is equally worthy of study. It seems needless to  dwell on the immense historical importance of letters written by  prominent actors in one of the decisive periods of the world's history,  when the great Republic, that had spread its victorious arms, and its  law and discipline, over the greater part of the known world, was in the  throes of its change from the old order to the new. If we would  understand--as who would not?--the motives and aims of the men who acted  in that great drama, there is nowhere that we can go with better hope of  doing so than to these letters. To the student of character also the  personality of Cicero must always have a great fascination. Statesman,  orator, man of letters, father, husband, brother, and friend--in all  these capacities he comes before us with singular vividness. In every  one of them he will doubtless rouse different feelings in different  minds. But though he will still, as he did in his lifetime, excite  vehement disapproval as well as strong admiration, he will never, I  think, appear to anyone dull or uninteresting. In the greater part of  his letters he is not posing or assuming a character; he lets us only  too frankly into his weaknesses and his vanities, as well as his  generous admirations and warm affections. Whether he is weeping, or  angry, or exulting, or eager for compliments, or vain of his abilities  and achievements, he is not a phantasm or a farceur, but a human being  with fiercely-beating pulse and hot blood.    The difficulty of the task which I have been bold enough to undertake  is well known to scholars, and may explain, though perhaps not excuse,  the defects of my work. One who undertakes to express the thoughts of  antiquity in modern idiom goes to his task with his eyes open, and has  no right at every stumbling-block or pitfall to bemoan his unhappy fate.  So also with the particular difficulties presented by the great founder  of Latin style--his constant use of superlatives, his doubling and  trebling of nearly synonymous terms, the endless shades of meaning in  such common words as _officium_, _fides_, _studium_, _humanitas_,  _dignitas_, and the like--all these the translator has to take in the  day's work. Finally, there are the hard nuts to crack--often very  hard--presented by corruption of the text. Such problems, though,  relatively with other ancient works, not perhaps excessively numerous,  are yet sufficiently numerous and sufficiently difficult. But besides  these, which are the natural incidents of such work, there is the  special difficulty that the letters are frequently answers to others  which we do not possess, and which alone can fully explain the meaning  of sentences which must remain enigmatical to us; or they refer to  matters by a word or phrase of almost telegraphic abruptness, with which  the recipient was well acquainted, but as to which we are reduced to  guessing. When, however, all such insoluble difficulties are allowed  for, which after all in absolute bulk are very small, there should (if  the present version is at all worthy) be enough that is perfectly plain  to everyone, and generally of the highest interest.    I had no intention of writing a commentary on the language of Cicero or  his correspondents, and my translation must, as a rule, be taken for the  only expression of my judgment formed after reading and weighing the  arguments of commentators. I meant only to add notes on persons and  things enabling the reader to use the letters for biographical, social,  and historical study. I should have liked to dedicate it by the words  _Boswellianus Boswellianis_. But I found that the difficulties of the  text compelled me to add a word here and there as to the solution of  them which I preferred, or had myself to suggest. Such notes are very  rare, and rather meant as danger signals than critical discussions. I  have followed in the main the chronological arrangement of the letters  adopted by Messrs. Tyrrell and Purser, to whose great work my  obligations are extremely numerous. If, as is the case, I have not  always been able to accept their conclusions, it is none the less true  that their brilliant labours have infinitely lightened my task, and  perhaps made it even possible.    I ought to mention that I have adopted the English mode of dating,  writing, for instance, July and August, though Cicero repudiated the  former and, of course, never heard of the latter. I have also refrained  generally from attempting to represent his Greek by French, partly  because I fear I should have done it ill, and partly because it is not  in him as in an English writer who lards his sentences with French. It  is almost confined to the letters to Atticus, to whom Greek was a second  mother-tongue, and often, I think, is a quotation from him. It does not  really represent Cicero's ordinary style.    One excuse for my boldness in venturing upon the work is the fact that  no complete translation exists in English. Mr. Jeans has published a  brilliant translation of a selection of some of the best of the letters.  But still it is not the whole. The last century versions of Melmoth and  Herbenden have many excellences; but they are not complete either (the  letters to Brutus, for instance, having been discovered since), and  need, at any rate, a somewhat searching revision. Besides, with many  graces of style, they may perhaps prove less attractive now than they  did a century ago. At any rate it is done, and I must bear with what  equanimity nature has given me the strictures of critics, who doubtless  will find, if so minded, many blemishes to set off against, and perhaps  outweigh, any merit my translation may have. I must bear that as well as  I may. But no critic can take from me the days and nights spent in close  communion with Rome's greatest intellect, or the endless pleasure of  solving the perpetually recurring problem of how best to transfer a  great writer's thoughts and feelings from one language to another:        \"Caesar in hoc potuit iuris habere nihil.\"          LETTERS IN VOLUME I                            Number                        in this                        Translation    Fam.
