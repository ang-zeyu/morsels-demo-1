LONDON          First published in 1922          {v}    PREFACE    The late convulsions in Greece and Turkey, and the consequent revival  of all the mis-statements which, during the War, flowed from ignorance  or malice, render the publication of this book particularly opportune.    Mr. Abbott deals with his subject in all its aspects, and presents for  the first time to the British public a complete and coherent view of  the complicated circumstances that made Greece, during the War, the  battle-ground of rival interests and intrigues, from which have grown  the present troubles.    In this book we get a clear account of the little-understood relations  between the Greek and the Serb; of the attitude of Greece towards the  Central Powers and the Entente; of the dealings between Greece and the  Entente and the complications that ensued therefrom.  Mr. Abbott traces  the evil to its source--the hidden pull of British versus French  interests in the Eastern Mediterranean, and the open antagonism between  M. Venizelos and King Constantine.    All these subjects are of acute interest, and not the least interesting  is the last.    The persecution of King Constantine by the Press of the Allied  countries, with some few good exceptions, has been one of the most  tragic affairs since the Dreyfus case.  Its effect on the state of  Europe during and since the War is remarkable.  If King Constantine's  advice had been followed, and the Greek plan for the taking of the  Dardanelles had been carried out, the war would probably have been  shortened by a very considerable period, Bulgaria and Rumania could  have been kept out of the War, and probably the Russian Revolution and  collapse would not have taken place; for, instead of having Turkey to  assist Bulgaria, the Allied forces would have been between and  separating these two countries.  {vi}    In this case King Constantine would not have been exiled from his  country, and consequently he would not have permitted the Greek Army to  be sent to Asia Minor, which he always stated would ruin Greece, as the  country was not rich enough or strong enough to maintain an overseas  colony next to an hereditary enemy like the Turk.    It is illuminating to remember that the Greek King's policy was fully  endorsed by the only competent authorities who had a full knowledge of  the subject, which was a purely military one.  These were the late  Field-Marshal Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the British Admiral at the  head of the Naval Mission in Greece, and Colonel Sir Thomas Cuninghame,  British Military Attache in Athens; but the advice tendered by these  three officers was disregarded in favour of that given by the  civilians, M. Venizelos and the Allied Ministers.    Mr. Abbott's book will do much to enlighten a misled public as to the  history of Greece during the last nine years, and many documents which  have not hitherto been before the public are quoted by him from the  official originals, to prove the case.    For the sake of truth and justice, which used to flourish in Great  Britain, I hope that this book will be read by everyone who has the  welfare of the British Empire at heart.      MARK KERR    4 _October_, 1922          {vii}    AUTHOR'S PREFACE    As this work goes to press, the British Empire finds itself forced to  vindicate its position in the East: a position purchased at the cost of  much blood and treasure during the war, to be jeopardized after the  conclusion of peace by the defeat of Greece and the defection of France.    In the following pages the reader will find the sequence of events  which have inevitably led up to this crisis: an account of transactions  hitherto obscured and distorted by every species of misrepresentation  and every known artifice for manipulating public opinion.    The volume is not a hasty essay produced to exploit an ephemeral  situation.  It embodies the fruit of investigations laboriously carried  on through six years.  A slight account of the earlier events appeared  as far back as the winter of 1916 in a book entitled, _Turkey, Greece,  and the Great Powers_: that was my first effort to place the subject in  its true perspective.  The results were interesting.  I was honoured by  the reproaches of several private and by the reprobation of several  public critics; some correspondents favoured me with their anonymous  scurrility, and some bigots relieved me of their acquaintance.  On the  other hand, there were people who, in the midst of a maelstrom of  passion, retained their respect for facts.    I pursued the subject further in a weekly journal.  Two of my  contributions saw the light; the third was suppressed by the  Authorities.  Its suppression furnished material for a debate in  Parliament: \"This is a cleverly written article,\" said Mr. John Dillon,  \"and I cannot find in it a single word which justifies suppression.  All that one can find in it is that it states certain facts which the  Government do not like to be known, not that they injure the military  situation in the least, but that they show that the Government, in the  opinion of the writer, made certain very bad blunders.\"  The Home  Secretary's answer was {viii} typical of departmental dialectics: \"It  is inconceivable to me,\" he declared, \"that the Government would  venture to say to the Press, or indicate to it in any way, 'This is our  view.  Publish it.  If you do not, you will suffer.'\"  What the  Government did, in effect, say to the Editor of the _National Weekly_  was: \"This is not our view.  Publish it not.  If you do, you will  suffer.\"    With an innocence perhaps pardonable in one who was too intent on the  evolution of the world drama to follow the daily development of  war-time prohibitions, I next essayed to present to the public through  the medium of a book the truth which had been banned from the columns  of a magazine.  The manuscript of that work, much fingered by the  printer, now lies before me, and together with it a letter from the  publisher stating that the Authorities had forbidden its publication on  pain of proceedings \"under 27 (b) of the Defence of the Realm  Regulations.\"    And so it came about that not until now has it been possible for the  voice of facts to refute the fables dictated by interest and accepted  by credulity.  The delay had its advantages: it gave the story, through  the natural progress of events, a completeness which otherwise it would  have lacked, and enabled me to test its accuracy on every point by a  fresh visit to Greece and by reference to sources previously  inaccessible, such as the Greek State Papers and the self-revealing  publications of persons directly concerned in the transactions here  related.    I venture to hope that so thorough an inquiry will convey some new  information respecting these transactions even to those who are best  acquainted with their general course.  If they find nothing attractive  in the style of the book, they may find perhaps something useful,  something that will deserve their serious reflection, in the matter of  it.  For let it not be said that a story starting in 1914 is ancient  history.  Unless one studies the record of Allied action in Greece from  the very beginning, he cannot approach with any clear understanding the  present crisis--a struggle between Greeks and Turks on the surface, but  at bottom a conflict between French and British policies affecting the  vital interests of the British Empire.    G. F. A.    5 _October_, 1922          {ix}    _Besides information acquired at first hand, my material is mainly  drawn from the following sources_:    Greek State Papers now utilized for the first time.    _White Book_, published by the Government of M. Venizelos under the  title, \"_Diplomatika Engrapha_, 1913-1917,\" 2nd edition, Athens, 1920.    _Orations_, delivered in the Greek Chamber in August, 1917, by M.  Venizelos, his followers, MM. Repoulis, Politis, and Kafandaris, and  his opponents, MM. Stratos and Rallis.  The Greek text (\"_Agoreuseis,  etc._,\" Athens, 1917) and the English translation (\"_A Report of  Speeches, etc.,_\" London, 1918), give them all, though the speech of M.  Stratos only in summary.  The French translation (\"_Discours, etc.,  Traduction de M. Leon Maccas, autorisee par le Gouvernement Grec,_\"  Paris, 1917) curiously omits both the Opposition speeches.    Skouloudis's _Apantesis_, 1917; _Apologia_, 1919; _Semeioseis_, 1921.  The first of these publications is the ex-Premier's Reply to statements  made in the Greek Chamber by M. Venizelos and others in August, 1917;  the second is his Defence; the third is a collection of Notes  concerning transactions in which he took part.  All three are of the  highest value for the eventful period of the Skouloudis Administration  from November, 1915, to June, 1916.    _Journal Officiel_, 24-30 October, 1919, containing a full report of  the Secret Committee of the French Chamber which sat from 16 June to 22  June, 1916.    Next in importance, though not inferior in historic interest, come some  personal narratives, of which I have also availed myself, by leading  French actors in the drama:    _Du Fournet_: \"Souvenirs de Guerre d'un Amiral, 1914-1916.\"  By  Vice-Admiral Dartige du Fournet, Paris, 1920.    _Sarrail_: \"Mon Commandement en Orient, 1916-1918.\"  By General  Sarrail, Paris, 1920."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

PREFACE.      The high estimation in which I have ever held the works of Rembrandt  has been greatly increased by my going through this examination of his  various excellencies, and such will ever be the case when the emanations  of genius are investigated; like the lustre of precious stones, their  luminous colour shines from the centre, not from the surface. With such  a mine of rich ore as the works of Rembrandt contain, it is necessary  to apologise for the paucity of examples offered, for in a work of this  kind I have been obliged to confine myself to a certain brevity and  a limited number of illustrations; still I must do my publisher the  justice to say, he has not grudged any expense that would be the means  of doing credit to the great artist, the enlightened patron, or my  own reputation. Another circumstance has been elicited in preparing  this work for publication--the great interest that all have shown in  this humble attempt to make Rembrandt and his works more generally  appreciated. His genius and productions seem to be congenial to the  English taste. As a colourist he will ultimately lay the foundation of  the British School of Painting, and prove the justice of Du Fresnoy's  lines--      \"He who colours well must colour bright;     Think not that praise to gain by sickly white.\"      Had it been possible, I would have given some examples of his colour as  well as of his chiaro-scuro; but I found his great charm consists more  in the tone of his colouring than its arrangement. I have mentioned in  the body of the work that Sir Joshua, certainly the greatest master of  colour we have yet had in England, frequently speaks ambiguously of many  of Rembrandt's pictures. I am therefore bound to quote a remark that he  makes to his praise. In his Memoranda he says--\"I considered myself as  playing a great game; and instead of beginning to save money, I laid it  out faster than I got it, in purchasing the best examples of art that  could be procured, for I even borrowed money for this purpose. The  possession of pictures by Titian, Vandyke, Rembrandt, &c., I considered  as the best kind of wealth.\"    With these remarks I must now launch the result of my labours, having  had constantly in mind that feeling which an advocate has in a good  cause, not to expect, by all his exertions, to increase the reputation  of his client, but an anxiety not to damage it by his weakness. Before  concluding I must again revert to the interest that all my friends  have taken in the success of this publication; and though it may  appear invidious to particularise any, I cannot omit mention of that  enthusiastic admirer of Rembrandt, my young friend Mr. E. W. Cooke;  the Messrs. Smith, of Lisle-street, the connoisseurs and extensive  dealers in his Etchings; Mr. Carpenter, the keeper of the prints in  the British Museum; and, lastly, my young literary friend, Mr. Peter  Cunningham, who has, from the beginning, entered heartily into the  cause of \"Rembrandt and his Works.\"    BROMPTON, November 4th, 1848.

In commencing an account of the life of Rembrandt Van Rhyn and his  works, I feel both a pleasure and a certain degree of confidence, as,  from my first using a pencil, his pictures have been my delight and  gratification, which have continued to increase through a long life of  investigation. Though I cannot expect to enhance the high estimation  in which Rembrandt is held by all persons competent to appreciate his  extraordinary powers, nevertheless, the publication of the results of  my study may tend to spread a knowledge of his principles and practice,  which may be advantageous to similar branches in other schools; for,  notwithstanding that his style is in the greatest degree original and  peculiar to himself, yet it is founded upon those effects existing in  nature which are to be discovered, more or less, in the works of all the  great masters of colouring and chiaro-scuro. Of his early life little  is known; for, unless cradled in the higher circles of society, the  early lives of eminent men frequently remain shrouded in obscurity.  The development of their genius alone draws attention to their history,  which is generally progressive; hence a retrospective view is ambiguous.  Little is known either of Rembrandt's birth or the place of his death;  what is known has already been related, from Houbraken to Bryan, and  from Bryan to Nieuwenhuys, and anecdotes have accumulated, for something  new must be said. It is, however, fortunate that in searching into  the source from which this extraordinary artist drew his knowledge,  we have only to look into the great book of Nature, which existed at  the time of Apelles and Raffaelle; and, notwithstanding the diversity of  styles adopted by all succeeding painters, beauties and peculiarities  are still left sufficient to establish the highest reputation for any  one who has the genius to perceive them, and the industry to make them  apparent. This was the cause of Rembrandt's captivating excellence;  neither a combination of Coreggio and Titian, nor of Murillo and  Velasquez, but as if all the great principles of chiaro-scuro and colour  were steeped and harmonized in the softening shades of twilight; and  this we perceive in nature, producing the most soothing and bewitching  results. These digressions may, however, come more properly into notice  when Rembrandt's principles of colour come under review.    Rembrandt Van Rhyn, the subject of this memoir, was born in the year  1606, between Leydendorp and Koukerk, in the neighbourhood of Leyden, on  the Rhyn, but certainly not in a mill, as there is no habitable dwelling  in the one now known as his father's. My excellent young friend, Mr. E.  W. Cooke, whose works breathe the true spirit of the best of the Dutch  school, in a letter upon this subject, says--        \"MY DEAR SIR,        \"I send you another sketch of the mill; the picture, including the      doorzigte, or view out of the window, I painted on the spot, and      that picture is now in the possession of the King of Holland, having      taken it back with me to show him. The mill was a magazine for powder      during the Spanish invasion; it was soon after converted into a corn      mill, and was in the possession of Hernan Geritz Van Rhyn when his      son Rembrandt was born; it is situated at Koukerk, on the old Rhyn,      near Leyden. I hope you will correct the vulgar error that Rembrandt      was born IN a mill. There are often dwelling houses attached to      water-mills, such as we have in England; but in Holland, not such a      structure as a water-mill, with water-power; the water-mills there      are only _draining mills_, such as we have in Lincolnshire, Norfolk,      &c. Surely the noise and movement of a windmill would ill accord with      the confinement of any lady, especially the mother of so glorious a      fellow as _Rembrandt_. For the honour of such association I hope you      will not omit my name in the work, for I painted three pictures of      that precious relic.        \"Yours, &c.        \"E. W. COOKE.\"      [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE MILL OF REMBRANDT'S FATHER]    [Illustration: EXTERIOR OF THE SAME]    The mill now known as the one possessed by Rembrandt's father is built  of stone, with an inscription, and \"_Rembrandt_,\" in gold letters, over  the door.
