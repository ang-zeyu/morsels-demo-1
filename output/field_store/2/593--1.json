As far as I can recollect, it was somewhat to  this effect: \"Comfortable home offered to a gentleman (a bachelor) at  moderate terms in an elderly Highland lady's house at Pitlochry. Must  be a strict teetotaller and non-smoker. F.M., Box so-and-so.\"    The naivete and originality of the advertisement pleased me. The idea  of obtaining as a boarder a young man combining such virtues as  abstinence from alcohol and tobacco amused me vastly. And then a  bachelor, too! Did she mean to make love to him herself? The sly old  thing! She took care to insert the epithet \"elderly,\" in order to  avoid suspicion; and there was no doubt about it--she thirsted for  matrimony. Being \"tabooed\" by all the men who had even as much as  caught a passing glimpse of her, this was her last resource--she would  entrap some unwary stranger, a man with money of course, and inveigle  him into marrying her. And there rose up before me visions of a tall,  angular, forty-year-old Scottish spinster, with high cheek-bones,  virulent, sandy hair, and brawny arms--the sort of woman that ought  not to have been a woman at all--the sort that sets all my teeth on  edge. Yet it was Pitlochry, heavenly Pitlochry, and there was no one  else advertising in that town. That I should suit her in every respect  but the matrimonial, I did not doubt. I can pass muster in any company  as a teetotaller; I abominate tobacco (leastways it abominates me,  which amounts to much about the same thing), and I am, or rather I can  be, tolerably amenable, if my surroundings are not positively  infernal, and there are no County Council children within shooting  distance.    But for once my instincts were all wrong. The advertiser--a Miss Flora  Macdonald of \"Donald Murray House\"--did _not_ resemble my  preconception of her in any respect. She was of medium height, and  dainty build--a fairy-like creature clad in rustling silks, with wavy,  white hair, bright, blue eyes, straight, delicate features, and hands,  the shape and slenderness of which at once pronounced her a psychic.  She greeted me with all the stately courtesy of the Old School; my  portmanteau was taken upstairs by a solemn-eyed lad in the Macdonald  tartan; and the tea bell rang me down to a most appetising repast of  strawberries and cream, scones, and delicious buttered toast. I fell  in love with my hostess--it would be sheer sacrilege to designate such  a divine creature by the vulgar term of \"landlady\"--at once. When  one's impressions of a place are at first exalted, they are often,  later on, apt to become equally abased. In this case, however, it was  otherwise. My appreciation both of Miss Flora Macdonald and of her  house daily increased. The food was all that could be desired, and my  bedroom, sweet with the perfume of jasmine and roses, presented such  a picture of dainty cleanliness, as awakened in me feelings of shame,  that it should be defiled by all my dusty, travel-worn accoutrements.  I flatter myself that Miss Macdonald liked me also. That she did not  regard me altogether as one of the common herd was doubtless, in some  degree, due to the fact that she was a Jacobite; and in a discussion  on the associations of her romantic namesake, \"Flora Macdonald,\" with  Perthshire, it leaked out that our respective ancestors had commanded  battalions in Louis XIV.'s far-famed Scottish and Irish Brigades. That  discovery bridged gulfs. We were no longer payer and paid--we were  friends--friends for life.    A lump comes into my throat as I pen these words, for it is only a  short time since I heard of her death.    A week or so after I had settled in her home, I took, at her  suggestion, a rest (and, I quite agree with her, it was a very  necessary rest) from my writing, and spent the day on Loch Tay,  leaving again for \"Donald Murray House\" at seven o'clock in the  evening. It was a brilliant, moonlight night. Not a cloud in the sky,  and the landscape stood out almost as clearly as in the daytime. I  cycled, and after a hard but thoroughly enjoyable spell of pedalling,  eventually came to a standstill on the high road, a mile or two from  the first lights of Pitlochry. I halted, not through fatigue, for I  was almost as fresh as when I started, but because I was entranced  with the delightful atmosphere, and wanted to draw in a few really  deep draughts of it before turning into bed. My halting-place was on a  triangular plot of grass at the junction of four roads. I propped my  machine against a hedge, and stood with my back leaning against a  sign-post, and my face in the direction whence I had come. I remained  in this attitude for some minutes, probably ten, and was about to  remount my bicycle, when I suddenly became icy cold, and a frightful,  hideous terror seized and gripped me so hard, that the machine,  slipping from my palsied hands, fell to the ground with a crash. The  next instant something--for the life of me I knew not what, its  outline was so blurred and indefinite--alighted on the open space in  front of me with a soft thud, and remained standing as bolt upright  as a cylindrical pillar. From afar off, there then came the low rumble  of wheels, which momentarily grew in intensity, until there thundered  into view a waggon, weighed down beneath a monstrous stack of hay, on  the top of which sat a man in a wide-brimmed straw hat, engaged in a  deep confabulation with a boy in corduroys who sprawled beside him.  The horse, catching sight of the motionless \"thing\" opposite me, at  once stood still and snorted violently. The man cried out, \"Hey! hey!  What's the matter with ye, beast?\" And then in an hysterical kind of  screech, \"Great God! What's yon figure that I see? What's yon figure,  Tammas?\"    The boy immediately raised himself into a kneeling position, and,  clutching hold of the man's arm, screamed, \"I dinna ken, I dinna ken,  Matthew; but take heed, mon, it does na touch me. It's me it's come  after, na ye.\"    The moonlight was so strong that the faces of the speakers were  revealed to me with extraordinary vividness, and their horrified  expressions were even more startling than was the silent, ghastly  figure of the Unknown. The scene comes back to me, here, in my little  room in Norwood, with its every detail as clearly marked as on the  night it was first enacted.

As you pass by in your limousine, or while  enjoying ten cents worth of fresh air on top of a green omnibus,  it jumps out and bites at you. Architects, confronted with it,  reel and throw up their hands defensively, and even the lay  observer has a sense of shock. The place resembles in almost  equal proportions a cathedral, a suburban villa, a hotel and a  Chinese pagoda. Many of its windows are of stained glass, and  above the porch stand two terra-cotta lions, considerably more  repulsive even than the complacent animals which guard New York's  Public Library. It is a house which is impossible to overlook:  and it was probably for this reason that Mrs. Pett insisted on  her husband buying it, for she was a woman who liked to be  noticed.    Through the rich interior of this mansion Mr. Pett, its nominal  proprietor, was wandering like a lost spirit. The hour was about  ten of a fine Sunday morning, but the Sabbath calm which was upon  the house had not communicated itself to him. There was a look of  exasperation on his usually patient face, and a muttered oath,  picked up no doubt on the godless Stock Exchange, escaped his  lips.    \"Darn it!\"    He was afflicted by a sense of the pathos of his position. It was  not as if he demanded much from life. He asked but little here  below. At that moment all that he wanted was a quiet spot where  he might read his Sunday paper in solitary peace, and he could  not find one. Intruders lurked behind every door. The place was  congested.    This sort of thing had been growing worse and worse ever since  his marriage two years previously. There was a strong literary  virus in Mrs. Pett's system. She not only wrote voluminously  herself--the name Nesta Ford Pett is familiar to all lovers of  sensational fiction--but aimed at maintaining a salon. Starting,  in pursuance of this aim, with a single specimen,--her nephew,  Willie Partridge, who was working on a new explosive which would  eventually revolutionise war--she had gradually added to her  collections, until now she gave shelter beneath her terra-cotta  roof to no fewer than six young and unrecognised geniuses. Six  brilliant youths, mostly novelists who had not yet started and  poets who were about to begin, cluttered up Mr. Pett's rooms on  this fair June morning, while he, clutching his Sunday paper,  wandered about, finding, like the dove in Genesis, no rest. It  was at such times that he was almost inclined to envy his wife's  first husband, a business friend of his named Elmer Ford, who had  perished suddenly of an apoplectic seizure: and the pity which he  generally felt for the deceased tended to shift its focus.    Marriage had certainly complicated life for Mr. Pett, as it  frequently does for the man who waits fifty years before trying  it. In addition to the geniuses, Mrs. Pett had brought with her  to her new home her only son, Ogden, a fourteen-year-old boy of a  singularly unloveable type. Years of grown-up society and the  absence of anything approaching discipline had given him a  precocity on which the earnest efforts of a series of private  tutors had expended themselves in vain. They came, full of  optimism and self-confidence, to retire after a brief interval,  shattered by the boy's stodgy resistance to education in any form  or shape. To Mr. Pett, never at his ease with boys, Ogden Ford  was a constant irritant. He disliked his stepson's personality,  and he more than suspected him of stealing his cigarettes. It  was an additional annoyance that he was fully aware of the  impossibility of ever catching him at it.    Mr. Pett resumed his journey. He had interrupted it for a moment  to listen at the door of the morning-room, but, a remark in a  high tenor voice about the essential Christianity of the poet  Shelley filtering through the oak, he had moved on.    Silence from behind another door farther down the passage  encouraged him to place his fingers on the handle, but a crashing  chord from an unseen piano made him remove them swiftly. He  roamed on, and a few minutes later the process of elimination had  brought him to what was technically his own private library--a  large, soothing room full of old books, of which his father had  been a great collector. Mr. Pett did not read old books himself,  but he liked to be among them, and it is proof of his pessimism  that he had not tried the library first. To his depressed mind it  had seemed hardly possible that there could be nobody there.    He stood outside the door, listening tensely. He could hear  nothing. He went in, and for an instant experienced that ecstatic  thrill which only comes to elderly gentlemen of solitary habit  who in a house full of their juniors find themselves alone at  last. Then a voice spoke, shattering his dream of solitude.    \"Hello, pop!\"    Ogden Ford was sprawling in a deep chair in the shadows.    \"Come in, pop, come in. Lots of room.\"    Mr. Pett stood in the doorway, regarding his step-son with a  sombre eye. He resented the boy's tone of easy patronage, all the  harder to endure with philosophic calm at the present moment from  the fact that the latter was lounging in his favourite chair.  Even from an aesthetic point of view the sight of the bulging  child offended him. Ogden Ford was round and blobby and looked  overfed. He had the plethoric habit of one to whom wholesome  exercise is a stranger and the sallow complexion of the confirmed  candy-fiend. Even now, a bare half hour after breakfast, his jaws  were moving with a rhythmical, champing motion.    \"What are you eating, boy?\" demanded Mr. Pett, his disappointment  turning to irritability.    \"Candy.\"    \"I wish you would not eat candy all day.\"    \"Mother gave it to me,\" said Ogden simply. As he had anticipated,  the shot silenced the enemy's battery. Mr. Pett grunted, but made  no verbal comment. Ogden celebrated his victory by putting  another piece of candy in his mouth.    \"Got a grouch this morning, haven't you, pop?\"    \"I will not be spoken to like that!\"    \"I thought you had,\" said his step-son complacently. \"I can  always tell. I don't see why you want to come picking on me,  though. I've done nothing.\"    Mr. Pett was sniffing suspiciously.    \"You've been smoking.\"    \"Me!!\"    \"Smoking cigarettes.\"    \"No, sir!\"    \"There are two butts in the ash-tray.\"    \"I didn't put them there.\"    \"One of them is warm.\"    \"It's a warm day.\"    \"You dropped it there when you heard me come in.\"    \"No, sir! I've only been here a few minutes. I guess one of the  fellows was in here before me. They're always swiping your  coffin-nails. You ought to do something about it, pop. You ought  to assert yourself.\"    A sense of helplessness came upon Mr. Pett. For the thousandth  time he felt himself baffled by this calm, goggle-eyed boy who  treated him with such supercilious coolness.    \"You ought to be out in the open air this lovely morning,\" he  said feebly.    \"All right. Let's go for a walk. I will if you will.\"    \"I--I have other things to do,\" said Mr. Pett, recoiling from the  prospect.    \"Well, this fresh-air stuff is overrated anyway. Where's the  sense of having a home if you don't stop in it?\"    \"When I was your age, I would have been out on a morning like  this--er--bowling my hoop.\"    \"And look at you now!\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Martyr to lumbago.\"    \"I am not a martyr to lumbago,\" said Mr. Pett, who was touchy on  the subject.    \"Have it your own way. All I know is--\"    \"Never mind!\"    \"I'm only saying what mother . . .\"    \"Be quiet!\"    Ogden made further researches in the candy box.    \"Have some, pop?\"    \"No.\"    \"Quite right. Got to be careful at your age.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Getting on, you know. Not so young as you used to be. Come in,  pop, if you're coming in. There's a draft from that door.\"    Mr. Pett retired, fermenting. He wondered how another man would  have handled this situation. The ridiculous inconsistency of the  human character infuriated him. Why should he be a totally  different man on Riverside Drive from the person he was in Pine  Street? Why should he be able to hold his own in Pine Street with  grown men--whiskered, square-jawed financiers--and yet be unable  on Riverside Drive to eject a fourteen-year-old boy from an easy  chair? It seemed to him sometimes that a curious paralysis of the  will came over him out of business hours.    Meanwhile, he had still to find a place where he could read his  Sunday paper.    He stood for a while in thought. Then his brow cleared, and he  began to mount the stairs. Reaching the top floor, he walked  along the passage and knocked on a door at the end of it. From  behind this door, as from behind those below, sounds proceeded,  but this time they did not seem to discourage Mr. Pett. It was  the tapping of a typewriter that he heard, and he listened to it  with an air of benevolent approval. He loved to hear the sound of  a typewriter: it made home so like the office.    \"Come in,\" called a girl's voice.    The room in which Mr. Pett found himself was small but cosy, and  its cosiness--oddly, considering the sex of its owner--had that  peculiar quality which belongs as a rule to the dens of men. A  large bookcase almost covered one side of it, its reds and blues  and browns smiling cheerfully at whoever entered. The walls were  hung with prints, judiciously chosen and arranged. Through a  window to the left, healthfully open at the bottom, the sun  streamed in, bringing with it the pleasantly subdued whirring of  automobiles out on the Drive. At a desk at right angles to this  window, her vivid red-gold hair rippling in the breeze from the  river, sat the girl who had been working at the typewriter. She  turned"]]]
