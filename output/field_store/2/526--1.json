TO MARY          CHAPTER XXIV.    [Illustration: 1-309-henry7.jpg  HENRY VII.]          HENRY VII.    {1485.} THE victory which the earl of Richmond gained at Bosworth was  entirely decisive; being attended, as well with the total rout and  dispersion of the royal army, as with the death of the king himself. Joy  for this great success suddenly prompted the soldiers, in the field of  battle, to bestow on their victorious general the appellation of king,  which he had not hitherto assumed; and the acclamations of \"Long live  Henry VII.,\" by a natural and unpremeditated movement, resounded from  all quarters. To bestow some appearance of formality on this species  of military election, Sir William Stanley brought a crown of ornament,  which Richard wore in battle, and which had been found among the spoils;  and he put it on the head of the victor. Henry himself remained not  in suspense; but immediately, without hesitation, accepted of the  magnificent present which was tendered him. He was come to the crisis  of his fortune; and being obliged suddenly to determine himself, amidst  great difficulties which he must have frequently revolved in his mind,  he chose that part which his ambition suggested to him, and to which he  seemed to be invited by his present success.    There were many titles on which Henry could found his right to the  crown; but no one of them free from great objections, if considered with  respect either to justice or to policy.    During some years, Henry had been regarded as heir to the house of  Lancaster by the party attached to that family; but the title of the  house of Lancaster itself was generally thought to be very ill founded.  Henry IV., who had first raised it to royal dignity, had never clearly  defined the foundation of his claim; and while he plainly invaded the  order of succession, he had not acknowledged the election of the people.  The parliament, it is true, had often recognized the title of the  Lancastrian princes; but these votes had little authority, being  considered as instances of complaisance towards a family in possession  of present power; and they had accordingly been often reversed during  the late prevalence of the house of York. Prudent men also, who had been  willing for the sake of peace to submit to any established authority,  desired not to see the claims of that family revived; claims which must  produce many convulsions at present, and which disjointed for the future  the whole system of hereditary right. Besides, allowing the title of the  house of Lancaster to be legal, Henry himself was not the true heir of  that family; and nothing but the obstinacy natural to faction, which  never without reluctance will submit to an antagonist, could have  engaged the Lancastrians to adopt the earl of Richmond as their head.  His mother indeed, Margaret, countess of Richmond, was sole daughter  and heir of the duke of Somerset, sprung from John of Gaunt, duke of  Lancaster: but the descent of the Somerset line was itself illegitimate,  and even adulterous. And though the duke of Lancaster had obtained  the legitimation of his natural children by a patent from Richard II.,  confirmed in parliament, it might justly be doubted whether this deed  could bestow any title to the crown: since in the patent itself all the  privileges conferred by it are fully enumerated, and the succession to  the kingdom is expressly excluded.[*] In all settlements of the crown  made during the reigns of the Lancastrian princes, the line of Somerset  had been entirely overlooked; and it was not till the failure of the  legitimate branch, that men had paid any attention to their claim. And  to add to the general dissatisfaction against Henry's title, his mother,  from whom he derived all his right was still alive; and evidently  preceded him in the order of succession.         * Rymer, tom. vii. p. 849. Coke's Inst. iv. Inst. part i. p.       37.    His title of the house of York, both from the plain reason of the case,  and from the late popular government of Edward IV., had universally  obtained the preference in the sentiments of the people; and Henry might  ingraft his claim on the rights of that family, by his intended marriage  with the princess Elizabeth, the heir of it; a marriage which he had  solemnly promised to celebrate, and to the expectation of which he had  chiefly owed all his past successes. But many reasons dissuaded Henry  from adopting this expedient. Were he to receive the crown only in right  of his consort, his power, he knew, would be very limited; and he must  expect rather to enjoy the bare title of king by a sort of courtesy,  than possess the real authority which belongs to it. Should the princess  die before him without issue, he must descend from the throne, and give  place to the next in succession; and even if his bed should be blest  with offspring, it seemed dangerous to expect that filial piety in his  children would prevail over the ambition of obtaining present possession  of regal power. An act of parliament, indeed, might easily be procured  to settle the crown on him during life; but Henry knew how much superior  the claim of succession by blood was to the authority of an assembly,[*]  which had always been overborne by violence in the shock of contending  titles, and which had ever been more governed by the conjunctures of the  times, than by any consideration derived from reason or public interest.    There was yet a third foundation on which Henry might rest his claim,  the right of conquest, by his victory over Richard, the present  possessor of the crown. But besides that Richard himself was deemed  no better than a usurper, the army which fought against him consisted  chiefly of Englishmen; and a right of conquest over England could  never be established by such a victory. Nothing also would give greater  umbrage to the nation than a claim of this nature; which might be  construed as an abolition of all their rights and privileges, and the  establishment of absolute authority in the sovereign.[**]         *Bacon in Kennet's Complete History, p. 579.         **Bacon, p. 579.    William himself, the Norman, though at the head of a powerful and  victorious army of foreigners, had at first declined the invidious  title of Conqueror; and it was not till the full establishment of his  authority, that he had ventured to advance so violent and destructive a  pretension.    But Henry was sensible that there remained another foundation of power,  somewhat resembling the right of conquest, namely, present possession;  and that this title, guarded by vigor and abilities, would be sufficient  to secure perpetual possession of the throne. He had before him the  example of Henry IV., who, supported by no better pretension, had  subdued many insurrections, and had been able to transmit the crown  peaceably to his posterity. He could perceive that this claim, which had  been perpetuated through three generations of the family of Lancaster,  might still have subsisted, notwithstanding the preferable title of the  house of York, had not the sceptre devolved into the hands of Henry  VI., which were too feeble to sustain it. Instructed by this recent  experience, Henry was determined to put himself in possession of regal  authority, and to show all opponents, that nothing but force of arms and  a successful war should be able to expel him. His claim as heir to the  house of Lancaster he was resolved to advance, and never allow it to  be discussed; and he hoped that this right, favored by the partisans of  that family, and seconded by present power, would secure him a perpetual  and an independent authority.    These views of Henry are not exposed to much blame; because founded on  good policy, and even on a species of necessity; but there entered into  all his measures and counsels another motive, which admits not of the  same apology. The violent contentions which, during so long a period,  had been maintained between the rival families, and the many sanguinary  revenges which they had alternately taken on each other, had inflamed  the opposite factions to a high pitch of animosity, Henry himself, who  had seen most of his near friends and relations perish in battle or  by the executioner, and who had been exposed in his own person to many  hardships and dangers, had imbibed a violent antipathy to the York  party, which no time or experience were ever able to efface. Instead  of embracing the present happy opportunity of abolishing these fatal  distinctions, of uniting his title with that of his consort, and of  bestowing favor indiscriminately on the friends of both families, he  carried to the throne all the partialities which belong to the head of  a faction, and even the passions which are carefully guarded against by  every true politician in that situation. To exalt the Lancastrian party,  to depress the adherents of the house of York, were still the favorite  objects of his pursuit; and through the whole course of his reign, he  never forgot these early prepossessions.

That princess had  discovered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her sister;  and as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which she was every  moment exposed, compassion towards her situation, and concern for her  safety, had rendered her, to an uncommon degree, the favorite of the  nation. A parliament had been assembled a few days before Mary's death;  and when Heathe, archbishop of York, then chancellor, notified to them  that event, scarcely an interval of regret appeared; and the two houses  immediately resounded with the joyful acclamations of \"God save Queen  Elizabeth: long and happily may she reign.\" The people, less actuated  by faction, and less influenced by private views, expressed a joy  still more general and hearty on her proclamation; and the auspicious  commencement of this reign prognosticated that felicity and glory which,  during its whole course, so uniformly attended it.[*]    Elizabeth was at Hatfield when she heard of her sister's death; and  after a few days she went thence to London, through crowds of people,  who strove with each other in giving her the strongest testimony of  their affection. On her entrance into the Tower, she could not forbear  reflecting on the great difference between her present fortune and that  which a few years before had attended her, when she was conducted to  that place as a prisoner, and lay there exposed to all the bigoted  malignity of her enemies. She fell on her knees, and expressed her  thanks to Heaven for the deliverance which the Almighty had granted her  from her bloody persecutors; a deliverance, she said, no less miraculous  than that which Daniel had received from the den of lions. This act of  pious gratitude seems to have been the last circumstance in which  she remembered any past hardships and injuries. With a prudence and  magnanimity truly laudable, she buried all offences in oblivion, and  received with affability even those who had acted with the greatest  malevolence against her. Sir Henry Benningfield himself, to whose  custody she had been committed, and who had treated her with severity,  never felt, during the whole course of her reign, any effects of her  resentment.[**] Yet was not the gracious reception which she gave,  prostitute and undistinguishing. When the bishops came in a body to  make their obeisance to her, she expressed to all of them sentiments  of regard; except to Bonner, from whom she turned aside, as from a man  polluted with blood, who was a just object of horror to every heart  susceptible of humanity.[***]         * Burnet, vol. ii. p. 373.         ** Burnet, vol. ii. p. 374.         *** Burnet, vol. ii. p. 374. Heylin, p. 102.    After employing a few days in ordering her domestic affairs, Elizabeth  notified to foreign courts her sister's death, and her own accession.  She sent Lord Cobham to the Low Countries, where Philip then resided;  and she took care to express to that monarch her gratitude for the  protection which he had afforded her, and her desire of persevering in  that friendship which had so happily commenced between them. Philip,  who had long foreseen this event, and who still hoped, by means of  Elizabeth, to obtain that dominion over England, of which he had failed  in espousing Mary, immediately despatched orders to the duke of Feria,  his ambassador at London, to make proposals of marriage to the queen;  and he offered to procure from Rome a dispensation for that purpose. But  Elizabeth soon came to the resolution of declining the proposal. She  saw that the nation had entertained an extreme aversion to the Spanish  alliance during her sister's reign; and that one great cause of the  popularity which she herself enjoyed, was the prospect of being freed by  her means from the danger of foreign subjection. She was sensible that  her affinity with Philip was exactly similar to that of her father with  Catharine of Arragon; and that her marrying that monarch was, in effect,  declaring herself illegitimate, and incapable of succeeding to the  throne. And though the power of the Spanish monarchy might still be  sufficient, in opposition to all pretenders, to support her title, her  masculine spirit disdained such precarious dominion, which, as it would  depend solely on the power of another, must be exercised according  to his inclinations.[*] But while these views prevented her from  entertaining any thoughts of a marriage with Philip, she gave him an  obliging, though evasive answer; and he still retained such hopes of  success, that he sent a messenger to Rome, with orders to solicit the  dispensation.         * Camden in Kennet, p. 370. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 375.    The queen too, on her sister's death, had written to Sir Edward Carne,  the English ambassador at Rome, to notify her accession to the pope; but  the precipitate nature of Paul broke through all the cautious measures  concerted by this young princess. He told Carne, that England was a fief  of the holy see; and it was great temerity in Elizabeth to have assumed,  without his participation, the title and authority of queen: that being  illegitimate, she could not possibly inherit that kingdom; nor could  he annul the sentence, pronounced by Clement VII. and Paul III., with  regard to Henry's marriage: that were he to proceed with rigor, he  should punish this criminal invasion of his rights, by rejecting all her  applications but being willing to treat her with paternal indulgence,  he would still keep the door of grace open to her, and that if she would  renounce all pretensions to the crown, and submit entirely to his will,  she should experience the utmost lenity compatible with the dignity of  the apostolic see.[*] When this answer was reported to Elizabeth,  she was astonished at the character of that aged pontiff; and having  recalled her ambassador, she continued with more determined resolution  to pursue those measures which already she had secretly embraced.    The queen, not to alarm the partisans of the Catholic religion, had  retained eleven of her sister's counsellors; but in order to balance  their authority, she added eight more, who were known to be inclined  to the Protestant communion: the marquis of Northampton, the earl of  Bedford, Sir Thomas Parry, Sir Edward Rogers, Sir Ambrose Cave, Sir  Francis Knolles, Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom she created lord keeper, and  Sir William Cecil, secretary of state.[**]         * Father Paul, lib. v.         ** Strype's Ann. vol. i. p. 5.    With these counsellors, particularly Cecil, she frequently deliberated  concerning the expediency of restoring the Protestant religion, and  the means of executing that great enterprise. Cecil told her, that the  greater part of the nation had, ever since her father's reign, inclined  to the reformation, and though her sister had constrained them to  profess the ancient faith, the cruelties exercised by her ministers  had still more alienated their affections from it: that happily the  interests of the sovereign here concurred with the inclinations of the  people; nor was her title to the crown compatible with the authority of  the Roman pontiff: that a sentence, so solemnly pronounced by two popes  against her mother's marriage, could not possibly be recalled without  inflicting a mortal wound on the credit of the see of Rome; and even if  she were allowed to retain the crown, it would only be on an uncertain  and dependent footing: that this circumstance alone counterbalanced all  dangers whatsoever; and these dangers themselves, if narrowly examined,  would be found very little formidable: that the curses and execrations  of the Romish church, when not seconded by military force, were, in the  present age, more an object of ridicule than of terror, and had now as  little influence in this world as in the next:"]]]
