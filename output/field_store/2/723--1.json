Egyptian  artists three thousand years B.C. used this method, and various mediums,  such as wax and mastic, were added as a fixative. It was what is now  known as tempera painting. The Greeks acquired their knowledge of the  art from the Egyptians, and later the Romans dispersed it throughout  Europe. They probably introduced tempera painting into this country for  decoration of the walls of their houses. The English monks visited the  Continent and learnt the art of miniature painting for illuminating  their manuscripts by the same process. Owing to opaque white being mixed  with the colours the term of painting in body-colour came in use.  Painting in this manner was employed by artists throughout Europe in  making sketches for their oil paintings.    Two such drawings by Albrecht Durer, produced with great freedom in  the early part of the sixteenth century, are in the British Museum.  The Dutch masters also employed the same means. Holbein introduced the  painting of miniature portraits into this country, for although the  monks inserted figures in their illuminations, little attempt was made  in producing likenesses. As early as the middle of the seventeenth  century the term \"water colours\" came into use. In an inventory, in  manuscript, of the personal estate of Charles I, which was sold by an  Act of Parliament, numerous pictures are thus described.    Wenceslaus Hollar, a native of Prague, came to England in 1637, and  became drawing-master to the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. The  painting of landscapes was first introduced by him into this country. He  made topographical drawings with a reed pen, and afterwards added slight  local colours. The earliest Englishman known to follow this style was  Francis Barlow. He is principally noted for his drawings with a pen,  slightly tinted, of animals and birds, with landscapes in the  background. Later, Peter Monamy, a marine painter who was born in  Jersey, produced drawings in a similar manner. Early in the eighteenth  century Pieter Tillemans came to England, and painted hunting scenes,  race-horses and country-seats. He worked in a free style in washes of  colour without any outlines with a pen or underlying grey tints. To a  \"Natural History of Birds,\" by George Edwards, library keeper to the  Royal College of Physicians, published in 1751, is added an appendix,  entitled, \"A Brief and General Idea of Drawing and Painting in Water  Colours: Intended for the amusement of the curious rather than the  instruction of artists.\" In it he states, \"There are two ways of  painting in water colours: one by mixing white with your colours and  laying on a thick body; the other is only washing your paper or vellum  with a thin water tinctured with colour.\" After giving details of the  methods to be employed he adds, \"the former method of using water  colours is called painting and the other washing or staining.\" During  the latter half of the century it became a fashion for landed gentry to  have engravings made of their country seats, and antiquarian  publications with illustrations were produced. These created a demand  for topographical draughtsmen to assist the engravers. In the catalogues  of the Exhibitions of the Society of Artists, the first of which was  held in 1760, the drawings by these men are styled as being \"stained,\"  \"tinted,\" or \"washed.\"    The English School of Water-Colour Painting was now firmly established,  and several artists have been claimed to be the \"father\" of it. Amongst  them were William Tavener, an amateur painter, whose drawings were never  topographically correct, as he exaggerated buildings to give them a  classic appearance; Samuel Scott, a marine painter and styled the  English Canaletto, he was called by Horace Walpole \"the first painter of  the age--one whose works will charm any age,\" and was also a friend of  Hogarth; also Alexander Cozens, born in Russia and the reputed son of  Peter the Great, but lately it has been suggested that Richard Cozens,  a ship-builder, who went to Russia in 1700, may have been his father.  He was sent to Italy to study art, and afterwards came to England. He  professed to teach amateurs how to produce pictures without study.  Edwards, in his \"Anecdotes of Painting,\" describes his process as  dashing out a number of accidental large blots and loose flourishes from  which he selected forms and sometimes produced very grand ideas. Dayes  called him \"Blotmaster-general to the town.\"    The painter, however, who is most generally regarded as being the father  of water-colour painting was Paul Sandby, R.A. He first obtained  employment in the Military Drawing Office of the Tower of London.  Afterwards he resided with his elder brother, Thomas Sandby, at Windsor.  At first he painted in the usual tinted manner of the period, but later  he worked with body-colour, by which manner he added considerable  richness to his drawings. _Windsor Castle: View of the Round and Devil's  Towers from the Black Rock_ (Plate I) is an admirable example of his  latter method. The drawing has been acquired through the Felton Bequest  Fund, and now hangs in the National Gallery of Victoria. Paul Sandby was  for many years the chief drawing-master at the Royal Military Academy at  Woolwich. He was also appointed by George III to give instruction in  drawing to his sons.    The work of Francis Towne has only of recent years come to be  appreciated. He belonged to a Devonshire family, but the exact place of  his birth is not known. He became a friend of William Pars, A.R.A., from  whom he received some instruction in drawing, and also went with him to  Rome in 1780. Although he spent considerable time on the Continent,  numerous drawings by him exist of scenes in his native country. _On the  Dart_ (Plate II) is a good example of his delicate method of painting.  His special skill lay \"in the management of even pen-line and in a  subtle modulation of colour upon a flat surface.\"    Amongst the early topographical men was Michael (Angelo) Rooker, A.R.A.  The additional Christian name is said to have been given to him by Paul  Sandby, under whom he studied for some time. He made pedestrian tours  through England, and executed a large number of drawings, which are  remarkable for their accuracy and delicate treatment, such as the  _Village Scene_ (Plate III).    Thomas Hearne was a contemporary with Rooker. It was a custom at this  period for topographical artists to travel abroad with British"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#1)"],[1,"HAND-BOOK OF MYTHOLOGY._           *       *       *       *       *    THE    MYTHS AND LEGENDS    OF    ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME.

The study of the classics themselves,  even where the attainments of the pupil have rendered this feasible, has  not been found altogether successful in giving to the student a clear and  succinct idea of the religious beliefs of the ancients, and it has been  suggested that a work which would so deal with the subject as to render it  at once interesting and instructive would be hailed as a valuable  introduction to the study of classic authors, and would be found to assist  materially the labours of both master and pupil.    In endeavouring to supply this want I have sought to place before the  reader a lifelike picture of the deities of classical times as they were  conceived and worshipped by the ancients themselves, and thereby to awaken  in the minds of young students a desire to become more intimately  acquainted with the noble productions of classical antiquity.    It has been my aim to render the Legends, which form the second portion of  the work, a picture, as it were, of old Greek life; its customs, its  superstitions, and its princely hospitalities, for which reason they are  given at somewhat greater length than is usual in works of the kind.    In a chapter devoted to the purpose some interesting particulars have been  collected respecting the public worship of the ancient Greeks and Romans  (more especially of the former), to which is subjoined an account of their  principal festivals.    I may add that no pains have been spared in order that, without passing  over details the omission of which would have {ii} marred the completeness  of the work, not a single passage should be found which could possibly  offend the most scrupulous delicacy; and also that I have purposely treated  the subject with that reverence which I consider due to every religious  system, however erroneous.    It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the importance of the study of  Mythology: our poems, our novels, and even our daily journals teem with  classical allusions; nor can a visit to our art galleries and museums be  fully enjoyed without something more than a mere superficial knowledge of a  subject which has in all ages inspired painters, sculptors, and poets. It  therefore only remains for me to express a hope that my little work may  prove useful, not only to teachers and scholars, but also to a large class  of general readers, who, in whiling away a leisure hour, may derive some  pleasure and profit from its perusal.
