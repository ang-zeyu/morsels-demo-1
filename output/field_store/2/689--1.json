Ballantyne.    ________________________________________________________________________    This book is well-written and carries the reader right up to the last  chapter, always panting to know what ever will happen next. It describes  a journey across central South America, at about the latitude of Buenos  Aires in Argentina. Lots of different sorts of nasty happenings, and  nasty people are encountered, and the problems are overcome one by one.  It seems quite realistic, but at anyrate it is a good product of the  writer's imagination and research. I enjoyed transcribing it very much.    Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was  educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with  the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northen  Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he  had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods  life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should  construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring  books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\",  \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences  with the HBC.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and  \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by  Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these  books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With  these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for  teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade,  the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph  cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the  life-boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet,  ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the  lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for  weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.    He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he  encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers  looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and  1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year,  all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last  ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.    He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for  very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".    For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what  we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in  those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red  River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little  dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how  they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.    Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books  formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less  pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched,  because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for  their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each  series.  Typical of these series is \"On the Coast\".    ________________________________________________________________________    THE ROVER OF THE ANDES, A TALE OF ADVENTURE IN SOUTH AMERICA, BY R.M.  BALLANTYNE.        CHAPTER ONE.    A TALE OF ADVENTURE IN SOUTH AMERICA.    AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE.    Towards the close of a bright and warm day, between fifty and sixty  years ago, a solitary man might have been seen, mounted on a mule,  wending his way slowly up the western slopes of the Andes.    Although decidedly inelegant and unhandsome, this specimen of the human  family was by no means uninteresting.  He was so large, and his legs  were so long, that the contrast between him and the little mule which he  bestrode was ridiculous.  He was what is sometimes styled \"loosely put  together;\" nevertheless, the various parts of him were so massive and  muscular that, however loosely he might have been built up, most men  would have found it rather difficult to take him down.  Although wanting  in grace, he was by no means repulsive, for his face, which was  ornamented with a soft flaxen beard and moustache of juvenile texture,  expressed wonderful depths of the milk of human kindness.    He wore boots with the trousers tucked into them, a grey tunic, or  hunting coat, belted at the waist, and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or  sombrero.    Evidently the times in which he travelled were troublous, for, besides  having a brace of large pistols in his belt, he wore a cavalry sabre at  his side.  As if to increase the eccentricity of his appearance, he  carried a heavy cudgel, by way of riding-whip; but it might have been  observed that, however much he flourished this whip about, he never  actually applied it to his steed.    On reaching a turn of the road at the brow of an eminence the mule  stopped, and, letting its head droop till almost as pendent as its tail,  silently expressed a desire for repose.  The cavalier stepped off.  It  would convey a false impression to say that he dismounted.  The mule  heaved a sigh.    \"Poor little thing!\" murmured the traveller in a soft, low voice, and in  a language which even a mule might have recognised as English; \"you may  well sigh.  I really feel ashamed of myself for asking you to carry such  a mass of flesh and bone.  But it's your own fault--you know it is--for  you _won't_ be led.  I'm quite willing to walk if you will only follow.  Come--let us try!\"    Gently, insinuatingly, persuasively, the traveller touched the reins,  and sought to lead the way.  He might as well have tried to lead one of  the snow-clad peaks of the mighty Cordillera which towered into the sky  before him.  With ears inclining to the neck, a resolute expression in  the eyes, his fore-legs thrown forward and a lean slightly backward, the  mule refused to move.    \"Come now, _do_ be amiable; there's a good little thing!  Come on,\" said  the strong youth, applying more force.    Peruvian mules are not open to flattery.  The advance of the fore-legs  became more decided, the lean backward more pronounced, the ears went  flat down, and incipient passion gleamed in the eyes.    \"Well, well, have it your own way,\" exclaimed the youth, with a laugh,  \"but don't blame me for riding you so much.\"    He once more re-m-; no, we forgot--he once more lifted his right leg  over the saddle and sat down.  Fired, no doubt, with the glow of  conscious victory the mule moved on and up at a more lively pace than  before.    Thus the pair advanced until they gained a rocky eminence, whence the  rich Peruvian plains could be seen stretching far-away toward the  glowing horizon, where the sun was about to dip into the Pacific.    Here again the mule stopped, and the rider getting off sat down on a  rock to take a look at the level horizon of the west--for he had reached  a spot where the next turn in the road would partially shut out the  plains and enclose him among the giant mountains.    As he sat there meditating, while the mule cropped the herbage at his  side, he observed two riders a considerable way down the circuitous road  by which he had ascended--a man and a boy, apparently.    Whether it was the fine stalwart figure of the man that influenced him,  or the mere presence of wayfarers in such a solitary place, our  traveller could not tell, but he certainly felt unusual interest, and  not only watched the pair as they approached, but sat still until they  came up.  As they drew near he perceived that the smaller of the two,  whom at a distance he had taken for a boy, was an Indian girl, who,  according to custom, bestrode her mule like a man.  Her companion was a  handsome Spanish-looking man--a Peruvian or it might be a Chilian--with  fine masculine features and magnificent black eyes.  He was well-armed,  and, to judge from his looks, seemed a little suspicious of the tall  Englishman.    The hearty salutation of the latter, however, in bad Spanish, at once  dissipated his suspicions.  Replying in the same tongue, he then added,  in good English:--    \"You are a stranger in this land, I perceive.\"    \"In truth I am,\" replied the other, while the Peruvian dismounted,  \"nevertheless, I ought scarcely to admit the fact, for I was born in  Peru.  This perhaps may seem contradictory, but it is not more so than  your being apparently a native of the soil yet speaking English like an  Englishman.\"    \"From which it follows,\" returned the Peruvian, \"that men ought not to  judge altogether by appearances.  But you are wrong in supposing me a  native of the soil, and yet--I am not an Englishman.  I have got a gift  of language, however--at least I feel myself equally at home in English,  Indian, Spanish, and Portuguese, which is not to be wondered at, seeing  that I have been forced to talk in all four languages for nigh a quarter  of a century.\"    \"Then you must have been but a boy when you came here,\" returned the  Englishman, \"for you seem to be not yet middle-aged.\"    \"Right, I was indeed a mere boy when I came to this land.\"    \"And I was a boy of seven when I left it to be educated in Europe,\"  returned the Englishman.  \"It is sixteen years since then, and I had  feared that my memory might have failed to recognise the old landmarks,  but I am rejoiced to find that I remember every turn of the road as if I  had left home but yesterday.\"    We have said that the tall youth's face was not handsome, but the glow  of animation which rested on it when he spoke of home, seemed for a  moment to transform it.    \"You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],[0,"Battles with the Sea (#1)"],[1,"WITH THE SEA, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.        CHAPTER ONE.    HEROES OF THE LIFEBOAT AND ROCKET.    SKIRMISHES WITH THE SUBJECT GENERALLY.    It ought to be known to all English boys that there is a terrible and  costly war in which the British nation is at all times engaged.  No  intervals of peace mark the course of this war.  Cessations of  hostilities there are for brief periods, but no treaties of peace.  \"War  to the knife\" is its character.  Quarter is neither given nor sought.  Our foe is unfeeling, unrelenting.  He wastes no time in diplomatic  preliminaries; he scorns the courtesies of national life.  No  ambassadors are recalled, no declarations of war made.  Like the Red  Savage he steals upon us unawares, and, with a roar of wrathful fury,  settles down to his deadly work.    How does this war progress?  It is needful to put and reiterate this  question from time to time, because new generations of boys are always  growing up, who, so far from being familiar with the stirring episodes  of this war, and the daring deeds of valour performed, scarcely realise  the fact that such a war is being carried on at all, much less that it  costs hundreds of lives and millions of money every year.    It may be styled a naval war, being waged chiefly in boats upon the sea.  It is a war which will never cease, because our foe is invincible, and  we will never give in; a war which, unlike much ordinary warfare, is  never unjust or unnecessary; which cannot be avoided, which is conducted  on the most barbarous principles of deathless enmity, but which,  nevertheless, brings true glory and honour to those heroes who are ever  ready, night and day, to take their lives in their hands and rush into  the thick of the furious fray.    Although this great war began--at least in a systematic manner--only  little more than fifty years ago, it will not end until the hearts of  brave and generous Britons cease to beat, and the wild winds cease to  blow, for the undying and unconquerable enemy of whom we write is--the  Storm!    \"Death or victory!\" the old familiar warwhoop, is not the final war-cry  here.  Death is, indeed, always faced--sometimes met--and victory is  often gained; but, final conquests being impossible, and the \"piping  times of peace\" being out of the question, the signal for the onset has  been altered, and the world's old battle-cry has been exchanged for the  soul-stirring shout of \"Rescue the perishing!\"    Though our foe cannot be slain, he can, like the genii of Eastern story,  be baffled.    In the days of old, the Storm had it nearly all his own way.  Hearts,  indeed, were not less brave, but munitions of war were wanting.  In this  matter, as in everything else, the world is better off now than it was  then.  Our weapons are more perfect, our engines more formidable.  We  can now dash at our enemy in the very heart of his own terrible  strongholds; fight him where even the boldest of the ancient Vikings did  not dare to venture, and rescue the prey from the very jaws of death  amid the scenes of its wildest revelry.    The heroes who recruit the battalions of our invincible army are the  bronzed and stalwart men of our sea-coast towns, villages, and hamlets--  men who have had much and long experience of the foe with whom they have  to deal.  Their panoply is familiar to most of us.  The helmet, a  sou'wester; the breastplate, a lifebelt of cork; the sword, a strong  short oar; their war-galley, a splendid _lifeboat_; and their shield--  the Hand of God.    In this and succeeding chapters I purpose to exhibit and explain in  detail our Lifeboats, and the great, the glorious work which they  annually accomplish; also the operations of the life-saving Rocket,  which has for many years rescued innumerable lives, where, from the  nature of circumstances, Lifeboats could not have gone into action.  I  hold that we--especially those of us who dwell in the interior of our  land--are not sufficiently alive to the deeds of daring, the thrilling  incidents, the terrible tragedies and the magnificent rescues which are  perpetually going on around our shores.  We are not sufficiently  impressed, perhaps, with the _nationality_ of the work done by the Royal  National Lifeboat Institution, which manages our fleet of 270 lifeboats.  We do not fully appreciate, it may be, the personal interest which we  ourselves have in the great war, and the duty--to say nothing of  privilege--which lies upon us to lend a helping hand in the good cause.    Before going into the marrow of the subject, let us put on the wings of  imagination, and soar to such a height that we shall be able to take in  at one eagle glance all the coasts of the United Kingdom--a sweep of  about 5000 miles all round!  It is a tremendous sight, for a storm is  raging!  Black clouds are driving across the murky sky; peals of thunder  rend the heavens; lightning gleams at intervals, revealing more clearly  the crested billows that here roar over the sands, or there churn and  seethe among the rocks.  The shrieking gale sweeps clouds of spray high  over our windward cliffs, and carries flecks of foam far inland, to tell  of the dread warfare that is raging on the maddened sea.    Near the shore itself numerous black specks are seen everywhere, like  ink-spots on the foam.  These are wrecks, and the shrieks and the  despairing cries of the perishing rise above even the roaring of the  gale.  Death is busy, gathering a rich harvest, for this is a notable  night in the great war.  The Storm-fiend is roused.  The enemy is abroad  in force, and has made one of his most violent assaults, so that from  Shetland to Cornwall, ships and boats are being battered to pieces on  the rocks and sands, and many lives are being swallowed up or dashed  out; while, if you turn your gaze further out to sea, you will descry  other ships and boats and victims hurrying onward to their doom.  Here,  a stately barque, with disordered topsails almost bursting from the  yards as she hurries her hapless crew--all ignorant, perchance, of its  proximity--towards the dread lee-shore.  Elsewhere, looming through the  murk, a ponderous merchantman, her mainmast and mizzen gone, and just  enough of the foremast left to support the bellying foresail that bears  her to destruction.    Think you, reader, that this sketch is exaggerated?  If so, let us  descend from our lofty outlook, and take a nearer view of facts in  detail.  I quote the substance of the following from a newspaper article  published some years ago.    The violence of the storm on Wednesday and Thursday night was terrific.  The damage to shipping has been fearful.  On sea the tremendous gale  proved disastrous beyond precedent.  Falmouth Harbour was the scene of  several collisions, and one barque and a tug steamer sank at their  anchors.  A wreck is reported at Lelant, to which the Penzance lifeboat  with a stout-hearted crew had started, when our despatch left, to rescue  thirteen men who could be descried hanging in the shrouds.  A fine new  ship is on Hayle bar, and another vessel is believed to be wrecked there  also.  Doubtless we have not yet heard of all the wrecks on the Cornish  coast; but it is in the magnificent bay which includes Torquay,  Paignton, and Brixham that the most terrible havoc has occurred.  On  Wednesday, about sixty sail were anchored in Torbay.  Eleven have gone  ashore at Broadsands, five of which are total wrecks.  The names of  those we could ascertain were the Fortitude, of Exeter; the Stately, of  Newcastle; the Dorset, of Falmouth, and a French brigantine.  At five  o'clock on Thursday evening some of the crews were being drawn ashore by  lines and baskets.  At Churston Cove one schooner is ashore and a total  wreck; there is also another, the Blue Jacket, which may yet be saved.  At Brixham there are two fine ships ashore inside the breakwater.  At  the back of the pier ten vessels have been pounded to matchwood, and all  that remains are a shattered barque, her masts still standing, two  brigs, and a schooner, all inextricably mingled together.  Twelve  trawlers have been sunk and destroyed.  Out of the sixty ships at anchor  on Wednesday night there were not more than ten left on Thursday  afternoon.  Many of these are disabled, some dismasted.  A fishing-boat  belonging to Brixham was upset in the outer harbour about eight o'clock,  and two married fishermen of the town and a boy were drowned.  At Elbury  a new brig, the Zouave, of Plymouth, has gone to pieces, and six out of  her crew of ten are drowned.  Eleven other vessels are on shore at  Elbury, many of the men belonging to which cannot be accounted for.  One  noble woman, named Wheaton, wife of a master mariner, saved two lives by  throwing a rope from the window of her house, which is built on the  rocks overhanging the bay at Furzeham Hill.  Scores of poor shipwrecked  men are wandering distractedly about Brixham and Churston, the greater  part of them having lost all they possessed.  The total loss of life  arising from these disasters is variously estimated at from seventy to a  hundred.    Is not this a tremendous account of the doings of one gale?  And let it  be observed that we have lifted only one corner of the curtain and  revealed the battlefield of only one small portion of our far-reaching  coasts.  What is to be said of the other parts of our shores during that  same wild storm?  It would take volumes instead of chapters to give the  thrilling incidents of disaster and heroism in full detail.  To convey  the truth in all its force is impossible, but a glimmering of it may be  obtained by a glance at the Wreck Chart which is published by the Board  of Trade every year.    Every black spot on that chart represents a wreck more or less  disastrous, which occurred in the twelve months.  It is an appalling  fact that about two thousand ships, upwards of seven hundred lives, and  nearly two millions sterling, are"]]]
