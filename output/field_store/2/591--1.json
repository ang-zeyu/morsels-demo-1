Very surprising it seems to assert that the Mother Country knows very  little about the finest colony which she possesses--and that an  enlightened people emigrate from sober, speculative England, sedate and  calculating Scotland, and trusting, unreflective Ireland, absolutely and  wholly ignorant of the total change of life to which they must  necessarily submit in their adopted home.    I recollect an old story, that an old gunner, in an old-fashioned,  three-cornered cocked hat, who was my favourite playfellow as a child,  used to tell about the way in which recruits were obtained for the Royal  Artillery.    The recruiting sergeant was in those days dressed much finer than any  field-marshal of this degenerate, railway era; in fact, the Horse Guards  always turned out to the sergeant-major of the Royal Military Academy of  Woolwich, when that functionary went periodically to the Golden Cross,  Charing Cross, to receive and escort the young gentlemen cadets from  Marlow College, who were abandoning the red coat and drill of the  foot-soldier to become neophytes in the art and mystery of great gunnery  and sapping.    \"The way they recruited was thus,\" said the bombadier. \"The gallant  sergeant, bedizened in copper lace from the crown of his head to the  sole of his foot, and with a swagger which no modern drum-major has ever  presumed to attempt, addressed a crowd of country bumpkins.    \"'Don't listen to those gentlemen in red; their sarvice is one which no  man who has brains will ever think of--footing it over the univarsal  world; they have usually been called by us the flatfoots. They uses the  musquet only, and have hands like feet, and feet like fireshovels.    \"'Mind me, gentlemen, the royal regiment of the Royal Artillery is a  sarvice which no gentleman need be ashamed of.    \"'We fights with real powder and ball, the flatfoots fights with  bird-shot. We knows the perry-ferry of the circumference of a round  shot. Did you ever see a mortar? Did you ever see a shell? I will answer  for it you never did, except the poticary's mortar, and the shell that  mortar so often renders necessary.    \"'Now, gentlemen, at the imperial city of Woolwich, in the Royal  Arsenal, you may, if you join the Royal Artillery, you may see shells in  earnest. Did you ever see a balloon? Yes! Then the shells there are  bigger than balloons, and are the largest hollow shot ever made--the  French has nothing like them.    \"'And the way we uses them! We fires them out of the mortars into the  enemy's towns, and stuffs them full of red sogers. Well, they bursts,  and out comes the flatfoots, opens the gates, and lets the Royal  Artillery in; and then every man fills his sack with silver, and gold,  and precious stones, after a leetle scrimmaging.    \"'Come along with me, my boys, and every one of you shall have a coat  like mine, which was made out of the plunder; and you shall have a horse  to ride, and a carriage behind it; and you shall see the glorious city  of Woolwich, where the streets are paved with penny loaves, and drink is  to be had for asking.'\"    So it is with nine-tenths of the emigrants to Canada in these  enlightened days; so it is with the emigrants from old England, and from  troubled Ireland, to the free and astonishing Union of the States of  America and Texas, that conjoint luminary of the new go-ahead world of  the West.    Dissatisfied with home, with visionary ideas of El Dorados, or starving  amidst plenty, the poorer classes obtain no correct information. Beset  generally with agents of companies, with agents of private enterprise,  with reckless adventurers, with ignorant priests, or missionaries of the  lowest stamp, with political agitators, and with miserable traitors to  the land of their birth and breeding, the poor emigrant starts from the  interior, where his ideas have never expanded beyond the weaver's loom  or factory labour, the plough or the spade, the hod, the plane, or the  trowel, and hastens with his wife and children to the nearest sea-port.    There he finds no friend to receive and guide him, but rapacious agents  ready to take every advantage of his ignorance, with an eye to his  scanty purse. A host of captains, mates, and sailors, eager to make up  so many heads for the voyage, pack them aboard like sheep, and cross the  Atlantic, either to New York or to Quebec, just as they have been able  to entice a cargo to either port. Then come the horrors of a long voyage  and short provisions, and high prices for stale salt junk and biscuit;  and, at the end, if illness has been on board, the quarantine, that most  dreadful visitation of all--for hope deferred maketh the heart sick.    From the first discovery of America, there has been a tendency to  exaggeration about the resources and capabilities of that country--a  magniloquence on its natural productions, which can be best exemplified  by referring the reader to the fac-simile of the one in Sir Walter  Raleigh's work on Guiana,[1] now in the British Museum. Shakespeare had,  no doubt, read Raleigh's fanciful description of \"the men whose heads do  grow beneath their shoulders,\" &c.; for he was thirty-four years of age  when this print was published, only seventeen years before his death.

M.D.XCIX.]    So expansive a mind as Raleigh's undoubtedly was, was not free from that  universal credulity which still reigns in the breasts of all men  respecting matters with which they are not personally acquainted; and  the glowing descriptions of Columbus and his followers respecting the  rich Cathay and the Spice Islands of the Indies have had so permanent a  hold upon the imagination, that even the best educated amongst us have,  in their youth, galloped over Pampas, in search of visionary  _Uspallatas_. Nor is it yet quite clear that the golden city of El  Dorado is wholly fabulous, the region in which it was said to exist not  having yet been penetrated by Science; but it soon will be, for a  steamboat is to ply up the Maranon, and Peru and Europe are to be  brought in contact, although the voyage down that mighty flood has  hitherto been a labour of several months.    The poor emigrant, for we must return to him, lands at New York. Sharks  beset him in every direction, boarding-houses and grogshops open their  doors, and he is frequently obliged, from the loss of all his  hard-earned money, to work out his existence either in that exclusively  mercantile emporium, or to labour on any canal or railroad to which his  kind new friends may think proper, or most advantageous to themselves,  to send him. If he escapes all these snares for the unwary, the chances  are that, fancying himself now as great a man as the Duke of Leinster,  O'Connell, the Lord Mayor of London, or the Provost of Edinburgh, free  and unshackled, gloriously free, he becomes entangled with a host of  land-jobbers, and walks off to the weary West, there to encounter a life  of unremitting toil in the solitary forests, with an occasional visit  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20019"],[0,"Lectures on Landscape (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                    LECTURES ON LANDSCAPE    DELIVERED AT OXFORD    IN LENT TERM, 1871.

I.    OUTLINE.      1. In my inaugural lecture,[1] I stated that while holding this  professorship I should direct you, in your practical exercises,  chiefly to natural history and landscape. And having in the course of  the past year laid the foundational elements of art sufficiently  before you, I will invite you, now, to enter on real work with me; and  accordingly I propose during this and the following term to give you  what practical leading I can in elementary study of landscape, and of  a branch of natural history which will form a kind of center for all  the rest--Ichthyology.    [Footnote 1: \"Lectures on Art, 1870,\" Sec. 23.]    In the outset I must shortly state to you the position which landscape  painting and animal painting hold towards the higher branches of art.    2. Landscape painting is the thoughtful and passionate representation  of the physical conditions appointed for human existence. It imitates  the aspects, and records the phenomena, of the visible things which  are dangerous or beneficial to men; and displays the human methods of  dealing with these, and of enjoying them or suffering from them, which  are either exemplary or deserving of sympathetic contemplation. Animal  painting investigates the laws of greater and less nobility of  character in organic form, as comparative anatomy examines those of  greater and less development in organic structure; and the function  of animal painting is to bring into notice the minor and unthought of  conditions of power or beauty, as that of physiology is to ascertain  the minor conditions of adaptation.    3. Questions as to the purpose of arrangements or the use of the  organs of an animal are, however, no less within the province of the  painter than of the physiologist, and are indeed more likely to  commend themselves to you through drawing than dissection. For as you  dissect an animal you generally assume its form to be necessary and  only examine how it is constructed; but in drawing the outer form  itself attentively you are led necessarily to consider the mode of  life for which it is disposed, and therefore to be struck by any  awkwardness or apparent uselessness in its parts. After sketching one  day several heads of birds it became a vital matter of interest to me  to know the use of the bony process on the head of the hornbill; but  on asking a great physiologist, I found that it appeared to him an  absurd question, and was certainly an unanswerable one.    4. I have limited, you have just heard, landscape painting to the  representation of phenomena relating to human life. You will scarcely  be disposed to admit the propriety of such a limitation; and you will  still less be likely to conceive its necessary strictness and  severity, unless I convince you of it by somewhat detailed examples.    Here are two landscapes by Turner in his greatest time--Vesuvius in  repose, Vesuvius in eruption.    One is a beautiful harmony of cool color; and the other of hot, and  they are both exquisitely designed in ornamental lines. But they are  not painted for those qualities. They are painted because the state of  the scene in one case is full of delight to men; and in the other of  pain and danger. And it is not Turner's object at all to exhibit or  illustrate natural phenomena, however interesting in themselves.    [Illustration: VESUVIUS IN ERUPTION.    From the painting by Turner.]    He does not want to paint blue mist in order to teach you the nature  of evaporation; nor this lava stream, to explain to you the operation  of gravity on ponderous and viscous materials. He paints the blue  mist, because it brings life and joy to men, and the lava stream  because it is death to them.    5. Again here are two sea-pieces by Turner of the same  period--photographs from them at least. One is a calm on the shore at  Scarborough; the other the wreck of an Indiaman.    These also are each painted with exquisitely artistic purpose: the  first in opposition of local black to diffused sunshine; the second in  the decorative grouping of white spots on a dark ground. That  decorative purpose of dappling, or [Greek: poikilia], is as studiously  and deliciously carried out by Turner with the Daedalus side of him, in  the inlaying of these white spots on the Indiaman's deck, as if he  were working a precious toy in ebony and ivory. But Turner did not  paint either of the sea-pieces for the sake of these decorous  arrangements; neither did he paint the Scarborough as a professor of  physical science, to show you the level of low tide on the Yorkshire  coast; nor the Indiaman to show you the force of impact in a liquid  mass of sea-water of given momentum. He painted this to show you the  daily course of quiet human work and happiness, and that, to enable  you to conceive something of uttermost human misery--both ordered by  the power of the great deep.    6. You may easily--you must, perhaps, for a little time--suspect me of  exaggeration in this statement. It is so natural to suppose that the  main interest of landscape is essentially in rocks and water and sky;  and that figures are to be put, like the salt and mustard to a dish,  only to give it a flavor.    Put all that out of your heads at once. The interest of a landscape  consists wholly in its relation either to figures present--or to  figures past--or to human powers conceived. The most splendid drawing  of the chain of the Alps, irrespective of their relation to humanity,  is no more a true landscape than a painting of this bit of stone. For,  as natural philosophers, there is no bigness or littleness to you.  This stone is just as interesting to you, or ought to be--as if it was  a million times as big. There is no more sublimity--_per se_--in  ground sloped at an angle of forty-five, than in ground level; nor in  a perpendicular fracture of a rock, than in a horizontal one. The only  thing that makes the one more interesting to you in a landscape than  the other, is that you could tumble over the perpendicular  fracture--and couldn't tumble over the other. A cloud, looked at as a  cloud only, is no more a subject for painting than so much feculence  in dirty water. It is merely dirty air, or at best a chemical solution  ill made. That it is worthy of being painted at all depends upon its  being the means of nourishment and chastisement to men, or the  dwelling place of imaginary gods. There's a bit of blue sky and cloud  by Turner--one of the loveliest ever painted by human hand. But, as a  mere pattern of blue and white, he had better have painted a jay's  wing: this was only painted by him--and is, in reality, only pleasant  to you--because it signifies the coming of a gleam of sweet sunshine  in windy weather; and the wind is worth thinking of only because it  fills the sails of ships, and the sun because it warms the sailors.    7. Now, it is most important that you should convince yourselves of  and fully enter into this truth, because all the difficulty in  choosing subject arises from mistakes about it. I daresay some of you  who are fond of sketching have gone out often in the most beautiful  country, and yet with the feeling that there was no good subject to be  found in it. That always arises from your not having sympathy enough  with its vital character, and looking for physical picturesqueness  instead. On the contrary, there are crude efforts at landscape-painting,  made continually upon the most splendid physical phenomena, in  America, and other countries without any history. It is not of the  slightest use. Niagara, or the North Pole and the Aurora Borealis,  won't make a landscape; but a ditch at Iffley will, if you have  humanity in you--enough in you to interpret the feelings of hedgers  and ditchers, and frogs.    8. Next, here is one of the most beautiful landscapes ever painted,  the best I have next to the Greta and Tees.    The subject physically is a mere bank of grass above a stream with  some wych-elms and willows. A level-topped bank; the water has cut its  way down through the soft alluvion of an elevated plain to the"]]]
