Hugh Fisher    London  George Bell and Sons    1898            GENERAL PREFACE.      This series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great  English Cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide-books at a  popular price. The aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled  with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of  Archaeology and History, and yet not too technical in language for the use  of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case  would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general  sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful  are:--(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in  questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2) the  numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the  Transactions of the Antiquarian and Archaeological Societies; (3) the  important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master of  the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the English  Cathedrals; and (5) the very excellent series of Handbooks to the  Cathedrals, originated by the late Mr. John Murray; to which the reader  may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in reference  to the histories of the respective sees.

In addition to the well-known books mentioned in the General Preface, the  \"Monastic Chronicles\" and many other works named in the text, some dealing  especially with Hereford have been of valuable assistance to me in  preparing this little book. Amongst these are the various careful studies  of the Rev. Francis Havergal, Dean Merewether's exhaustive \"Statement of  the Condition and Circumstances of the Cathedral Church of Hereford in the  Year 1841,\" and \"The Diocese of Hereford,\" by the Rev. H.W. Phillott.    My best thanks are also due to the Photochrom Company for their excellent  photographs.                                                               A. HUGH FISHER.

The early history of Hereford, like that of the majority of cathedral  churches, is veiled in the obscurity of doubtful speculation and shadowy  tradition. Although the see had existed from the sixth century, it is not  till much later that we have any information concerning the cathedral  itself.    From 755 to 794 there reigned in Mercia one of the most powerful and  important rulers of those times,--King Offa. He was a contemporary of  Charles the Great, and more than once these two sovereigns exchanged gifts  and letters. Under Offa Mercia became the first power in Britain, and in  addition to much fighting with the West Saxons and the Kentish men he  wrested a large piece of the country lying west of the Severn from the  Welsh, took the chief town of the district which was afterwards called  Shrewsbury, and like another Severus made a great dyke from the mouth of  the Wye to that of the Dee which became henceforth the boundary between  Wales and England, a position it has held with few changes to the present  day. In church history Offa is of no less importance than in secular, for  as the most powerful King in England he seems to have determined that  ecclesiastical affairs in this country should be more under his control,  or at least supervision, than they could possibly be with the Mercian  church subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 786, therefore, he  persuaded the Pope to create the Archbishopric of Lichfield. Although  Canterbury regained its supremacy upon Offa's death when Lichfield was  shorn by a new Pope of its recently acquired honours, the position gained  for the latter see by Offa, though temporary in itself, must have had  lasting and important influence. Offa is generally held responsible for  the murder, about 793, of AEthelberht, King of the East Angles, who had  been promised his daughter, AEthelthryth, in marriage.    Had AEthelberht been gifted with a knowledge of future events (which would  not have been a more wonderful attribute than many of the virtues which  were ascribed afterwards to his dead body), he could hardly have desired a  more glorious fate. His murder gained for him martyrdom with its immortal  glory, and he could scarce have met his death under happier auspices.  Visiting a king's residence to fetch his bride he died by the order of a  man whose memory is sullied by no other stain, a man renowned in war, a  maker of laws for the good of his people, and eminent in an ignorant age  as one who encouraged learning.    Legend and tradition have so obscured this event that beyond the bare fact  of the murder nothing can be positively asserted, and the brief statement  of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, \"792. This year Offa, King of the Mercians,  commanded the head of King AEthelberht to be struck off,\" contains all that  we may be certain of.    One writer speaks of a hired assassin, and others lay the crime at the  door of Cynethryth, Offa's Queen, who is said to have insinuated that the  marriage was only sought as a pretext to occupy the Mercian throne.  Finding her lord's courage not equal to the occasion, she herself arranged  the end of AEthelberht. There is talk of a pit dug in his sleeping-chamber  and a chair arranged thereover, which, with an appearance of luxurious  comfort, lured him to his fate. The body was, according to one writer,  privately buried on the bank of the river \"Lugg,\" near Hereford.    \"On the night of his burial,\" says the Monkish Annalist, \"a column of  light, brighter than the sun, arose towards heaven\"; and three nights  afterwards the figure (or ghost) of King AEthelberht appeared to Brithfrid,  a nobleman, and commanded him to convey the body to a place called  \"Stratus Waye,\" and to inter it near the monastery there. Guided by  another column of light, Brithfrid, having placed the body and the head on  a carriage, proceeded on his journey. The head fell from the vehicle, but  having been discovered by a \"blind man,\" to whom it miraculously  communicated sight, was restored by him to the careless driver. Arrived at  his place of destination, then called \"Fernlega\" or \"Saltus Silicis,\" and  which has since been termed Hereford, he there interred the body. Whatever  the motive for the crime, there is ample evidence of Offa's subsequent  remorse.  In atonement he built monasteries and churches, and is even said  by some to have gone on a pilgrimage to Rome, though this rests on slight  evidence.    The miracles worked at the tomb of the murdered King were, according to  Asser, so numerous and incredible that Offa, who had appropriated  AEthelberht's kingdom, was induced to send two bishops to Hereford to  ascertain the truth of them, and it is generally agreed that about A.D.  825 Milfrid, who was Viceroy to the Mercian King Egbert after the death of  Offa and of his son Egfrid, expended a large sum of money in building  \"_Ecclesiam egregiam, lapidea structura_\" at Hereford, which he  consecrated to the martyred monarch, and endowed with lands and enriched  with ornaments.    Although one of the old chroniclers calls it a church of stone, it is  quite uncertain what were the materials, size, or architectural character  of this edifice. It seems, however, that by 1012, when Bishop Athelstan  was promoted to the see, it had fallen into sheer ruin, or, at any rate,  sufficient decay to necessitate his beginning a new building. Of this no  clearer account has been handed down to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Sweeting, who had originally undertaken to write this  monograph on St. Albans, having been obliged, on account of ill-health,  to abandon the work, the Publishers asked me to write it in his stead.  My task was rendered much easier by Mr. Sweeting kindly sending me much  material that he had collected, and many valuable notes that he had  made, especially on the history of the Abbey.    My best thanks are due to the Dean for kindly allowing me permission to  examine every part of the Cathedral church, and to take the photographs  with which this book is illustrated. A few illustrations only are from  other sources, among them those on pages 9 and 11, for permission to use  which I have to thank Mr. John Murray. I have also to acknowledge the  courtesy of the vergers, Mr. Newell and Miss Davis from both of whom I  obtained much information; Miss Davis's long connection with the church,  and the interest she takes in every detail connected with it, rendered  her help most valuable. I have consulted many books on the Abbey, among  them Lord Grimthorpe's and Mr. Page's Guides, Mr. James Neale's  \"Architectural Notes on St. Albans Abbey,\" and papers read before the  St. Albans Archaeological Society by the Rev. Henry Fowler.                                                            THOMAS PERKINS.

ALBANS ABBEY, BEFORE 1874.]          ST. ALBANS CATHEDRAL          CHAPTER I.    HISTORY OF THE BUILDING.      Long before any church stood on the site of the present cathedral, long  before the time of Albanus, who is universally allowed to have been the  first Christian martyr whose blood was shed in this island, events that  have found a place in the early history of Britain occurred in the  immediate neighbourhood of the city we call St. Albans. Here in all  probability stood the _oppidum_ or stockaded stronghold of  Cassivellaunus, who was chosen to lead the tribes of South-Eastern  Britain when Julius Caesar in the year 54 B.C. made his second descent  on the island. We all know the story, how the Britons gave Caesar so  much trouble that, when at last Roman discipline had secured the  victory, he, demanding tribute and receiving hostages as guarantees for  its payment, left Britain and never cared to venture upon any fresh  invasion. We know that the Trinobantes were the first to sue for peace,  and, abandoning Cassivellaunus, left him to bear the brunt of Caesar's  attack upon his stronghold, how this was destroyed by Caesar, and how  Cassivellaunus also was obliged to make submission to the Romans.    Nearly a century passed before any Roman legionary again set foot on the  British shores; but when at last, in the days of Claudius, A.D. 42, the  Romans invaded the island, they came to conquer and occupy all except  the northern part of Britain. In the early days of their occupation a  walled town, which was soon raised to the rank of a _municipium_, was  built on the south-western side of the Ver, and from the name of the  river was called Verulamium or Verlamium. It soon became a populous  place, for when in A.D. 61 Boadicea, the Queen of the Iceni, stung by  the insults and injuries she and her daughters had received at the hands  of the Romans, raised her own and the neighbouring tribes to take  vengeance on their oppressors and        Ran the land with Roman slaughter, multitudinous agonies;      Perish'd many a maid and matron, many a valorous legionary;      Fell the colony, city, and citadel, London, Verulam, Camulodune.    It is recorded that no less than seventy thousand fell in these three  places and the villages around them.    But her vengeance, sharp and sudden, was not allowed to pass unpunished  by the Romans, and Suetonius Paulinus, hurrying from North Wales, though  too late to save the three towns, utterly routed the forces of Boadicea  somewhere between London and Colchester.    After this Verulamium became once more a prosperous town, inhabited  partly by Romans, partly by Britons, who under Roman influence embraced  the civilization and adopted the customs of their conquerors. By whom  Christianity was first introduced into Britain we do not know; probably  it was brought from Gaul. In the reign of Diocletian a great persecution  of the Christians arose throughout the Roman empire. The edict enjoining  this persecution was promulgated in February, 303 A.D., and the  persecution lasted until the Emperor abdicated in May, 305 A.D. It was  carried out in Britain by Maximianus Herculius and Asclepiodotus, and it  was during this persecution that St. Alban won the martyr's crown.  Though the story is embellished with certain miraculous incidents which  most of us will reject as accretions of later ages, yet there seems no  reason to doubt the main facts.    Albanus, or Alban, as we generally call him, was a young soldier and a  heathen, but being a man of a pitiful heart, he gave shelter to a  certain deacon named Amphibalus, who was in danger of death. Amphibalus  returned his"]]]
