HALL, M.D.        BOSTON AND NEW YORK    HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY    The Riverside Press Cambridge        COPYRIGHT, 1915, BY HERBERT J. HALL    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED    _Published May 1915_          PREFACE      A very wise physician has said that \"every illness has two parts--what  it is, and what the patient thinks about it.\" What the patient thinks  about it is often more important and more troublesome than the real  disease. What the patient thinks of life, what life means to him is also  of great importance and may be the bar that shuts out all real health  and happiness. The following pages are devoted to certain ideals of life  which I would like to give to my patients, the long-time patients who  have especially fallen to my lot.    They are not all here, the steps to health and happiness. The reader may  even be annoyed and baffled by my indirectness and unwillingness to be  specific. That I cannot help--it is a personal peculiarity; I cannot ask  any one to live by rule, because I do not believe that rules are  binding and final. There must be character behind the rule and then the  rule is unnecessary.    All that I have written has doubtless been presented before, in better  ways, by wiser men, but I believe that each writer may expect to find  his small public, his own particular public who can understand and  profit by his teachings, having partly or wholly failed with the others.  For that reason I am encouraged to write upon a subject usually shunned  by medical men, being assured of at least a small company of friendly  readers.    I am grateful to a number of friends and patients who have read the  manuscript of the following chapters. These reviewers have been frank  and kind and very helpful. I am particularly indebted to Dr. Richard C.  Cabot, who has given me much valuable assistance.          CONTENTS           I. THE UNTROUBLED MIND              1        II.

THE CURE BY FAITH               88          I    THE UNTROUBLED MIND          Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,      Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,      Raze out the written troubles of the brain,      And with some sweet oblivious antidote      Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff      Which weighs upon the heart?                  MACBETH.    When a man tells me he never worries, I am inclined to think that he is  either deceiving himself or trying to deceive me. The great roots of  worry are conscience, fear, and regret. Undoubtedly we ought to be  conscientious and we ought to fear and regret evil. But if it is to be  better than an impediment and a harm, our worry must be largely  unconscious, and intuitive. The moment we become conscious of worry we  are undone. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we cannot leave conscience to  its own devices unless our lives are big enough and fine enough to  warrant such a course. The remedy for the mental unrest, which is in  itself an illness, lies not in an enlightened knowledge of the  harmfulness and ineffectiveness of worry, not even in the acquirement of  an unconscious conscience, but in the living of a life so full and good  that worry cannot find place in it. That idea of worry and conscience,  that definition of serenity, simplifies life immensely. To overcome  worry by substituting development and growth need never be dull work. To  know life in its farther reaches, life in its better applications, is  the final remedy--the great undertaking--_it is life_. We must warn  ourselves, not infrequently, that the larger life is to be pursued for  its own glorious self and not for the sake of peace. Peace may come, a  peace so sure that death itself cannot shake it, but we must not expect  all our affairs to run smoothly. As a matter of fact they may run badly  enough; we shall have our ups and downs, we shall sin and repent, and  sin again, but if in the end we live according to our best intuitions,  we shall be justified, and we need not worry about the outcome. To put  it another way, if we would have the untroubled mind, we must transfer  our conscientious efforts from the small details of life--from the worry  and fret of common things--into another and a higher atmosphere. We must  transfigure common life, dignify it and ennoble it; then, although the  old causes of worry may continue, we shall have gained a stature that  will make us unconscious masters of the little troubles and in a great  degree equal to the larger requirements. Life will be easier, not  because we make less effort, but because we are working from another and  a better level.    If such a change, and it would be a change for most of us, could come  about instantly, in a flash of revelation, that would be ideal, but it  would not be life. We must return again and again to the old uninspired  state wherein we struggle conscientiously with perverse details. I would  not minimize the importance and value of this struggle; only the sooner  it changes its level the better for every one concerned. Large serenity  must, finally, be earned through the toughening of moral fibre that  comes in dealing squarely with perplexing details. Some of this struggle  must always be going on, but serener life will come when we begin to  concern ourselves with larger factors.    How are we to live the larger life? Partly through uninspired struggle  and through the brave meeting of adversity, but partly, also, in a way  that may be described as \"out of hand,\" by intuition, by exercise of the  quality of mind that sees visions and grasps truths beyond the realms of  common thought.    I am more and more impressed with the necessity of inspiration in life  if we are to be strong and serene, and so finally escape the pitfalls  of worry and conscience. By inspirations I do not mean belief in any  system or creed. It is not a stated belief that we need to begin with;  that may come in time. We need first to find in life, or at least in  nature, an essential beauty that makes its own true, inevitable response  within us. We must learn to love life so deeply that we feel its  tremendous significance, until we find in the sea and the sky the  evidence of an overbrooding spirit too great to be understood, but not  too great to satisfy the soul. This is a sort of mother religion--the  matrix from which all sects and creeds are born. Its existence in us  dignifies us and makes simple, purposeful, and receptive living almost  inevitable. We may not know why we are living according to the dictates  of our inspiration, but we shall live so and that is the important  consideration.    If I urge the acquirement of a religious conception that we may cure  the intolerable distress of worry, I do what I have already warned  against. It is so easy to make this mistake that I have virtually made  it on the same page with my warning. We have no right to seek so great a  thing as religious experience that we may be relieved of suffering.  Better go on with pain and distress than cheapen religion by making it a  remedy. We must seek it for its own sake, or rather, we must not seek it  at all, lest, like a dream, it elude us, or change into something else,  less holy. Nevertheless, it is true that if we will but look with open,  unprejudiced eyes, again and again, upon the sunrise or the stars above  us, we shall become conscious of a presence greater and more beautiful  than our minds can think. In the experience of that vision strength and  peace will come to us unbidden. We shall find our lives raised, as by an  unseen force, above the warfare of conscience and worry. We shall begin  to know the meaning of serenity and of that priceless, if not wholly to  be acquired, possession, the untroubled mind.    I am aware that I shall be misunderstood and perhaps ridiculed by my  colleagues when I attempt to discuss religion in any way. Theology is a  field in which I have had no training, but that is the very reason why I  dare write of it. I do not even assume that there is a God in the  traditional sense. The idea is too great to be made concrete and  literal. No single fact of nature can be fully understood by our finite  minds. But I do feel vaguely that the laws that compass us, and make our  lives possible, point always on--\"beyond the realms of time and  space\"--toward the existence of a mighty overruling spirit. If this is a  cold and inadequate conception of God, it is at least one that can be  held by any man without compromise.    The modern mind is apt to fail of religious understanding and support,  because of the arbitrary interpretations of religion which are  presented for our acceptance. It is what men say about religion, rather  than religion itself, that repels us. Let us think it out for ourselves.  If we are open to a simple, even primitive, conception of God, we may  still repudiate the creeds and doctrines, but we are likely to become  more tolerant of those who find them true and good. We shall be likely  in time to find the religion of Christ understandable and  acceptable--warm and quick with life. The man who ungrudgingly opens his  heart to the God of nature will be religious in the simplest possible  sense. He may worry because of the things he cannot altogether  understand, and because he falls so far short of the implied ideal. But  he will have enlarged his life so much that the common worries will find  little room--he will be too full of the joy of living to spend"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#1)"],[1,"& COMPY.,                               TEA MERCHANTS,                8, KING WILLIAM STREET, CITY, LONDON, E.C.,                              Invariably sell                           THE BEST AND CHEAPEST                        TEAS AND COFFEES IN ENGLAND.                     *       *       *       *       *                         GOOD STRONG USEFUL CONGOU,                2s. 6d., 2s. 8d., 2s. 10d., 3s., and 3s. 4d.

My object in writing this little book is to show you how you may prepare  and cook your daily food, so as to obtain from it the greatest amount of  nourishment at the least possible expense; and thus, by skill and  economy, add, at the same time, to your comfort and to your  comparatively slender means. The Recipes which it contains will afford  sufficient variety, from the simple every-day fare to more tasty dishes  for the birthday, Christmas-day, or other festive occasions.    In order to carry out my instructions properly, a few utensils will be  necessary. Industry, good health, and constant employment, have, in many  instances, I trust, enabled those whom I now address to lay by a little  sum of money. A portion of this will be well spent in the purchase of  the following articles:--A cooking-stove, with an oven at the side, or  placed under the grate, which should be so planned as to admit of the  fire being open or closed at will; by this contrivance much heat and  fuel are economized; there should also be a boiler at the back of the  grate. By this means you would have hot water always ready at hand, the  advantage of which is considerable. Such poor men's cooking-stoves  exist, on a large scale, in all modern-built lodging-houses. Also, a  three-gallon iron pot with a lid to it, a one-gallon saucepan, a  two-quart ditto, a frying-pan, a gridiron, and a strong tin baking-dish.    Here is a list of the cost prices at which the above-named articles, as  well as a few others equally necessary, may be obtained of all  ironmongers:--                                                        L  _s._ _d._    A cooking-stove, 2 ft. 6 in. wide, with oven only   1   10    0  Ditto, with oven and boiler                         1   18    0  A three-gallon oval boiling pot                     0    4    6  A one-gallon tin saucepan, and lid                  0    2    6  A two-quart ditto                                   0    1    6  A potato steamer                                    0    2    0  An oval frying-pan, from                            0    0   10  A gridiron, from                                    0    1    0  A copper for washing or brewing, twelve gallons     1   10    0  A mash-tub, from                                    0   10    0  Two cooling-tubs (or an old wine or beer cask cut    in halves, would be cheaper, and answer the same    purpose), each 6_s._                              0   12    0                                                     ------------                                                     L6   12    4                                                     ------------    To those of my readers who, from sickness or other hindrance, have not  money in store, I would say, strive to lay by a little of your weekly  wages to purchase these things, that your families may be well fed, and  your homes made comfortable.    And now a few words on baking your own bread. I assure you if you would  adopt this excellent practice, you would not only effect a great saving  in your expenditure, but you would also insure a more substantial and  wholesome kind of food; it would be free from potato, rice, bean or pea  flour, and alum, all of which substances are objectionable in the  composition of bread. The only utensil required for bread-making would  be a tub, or trough, capable of working a bushel or two of flour. This  tub would be useful in brewing, for which you will find in this book  plain and easy directions.    I have pointed out the necessity of procuring these articles for cooking  purposes, and with the injunction to use great care in keeping them  thoroughly clean, I will at once proceed to show you their value in a  course of practical and economical cookery, the soundness and plainness  of which I sincerely hope you will all be enabled to test in your own  homes.          COOKERY BOOK.      No. 1. BOILED BEEF.    This is an economical dinner, especially where there are many mouths to  feed. Buy a few pounds of either salt brisket, thick or thin flank, or  buttock of beef; these pieces are always to be had at a low rate. Let us  suppose you have bought a piece of salt beef for a Sunday's dinner,  weighing about five pounds, at 6-1/2_d._ per pound, that would come to  2_s._ 8-1/2_d._; two pounds of common flour, 4_d._, to be made into suet  pudding or dumplings, and say 8-1/2_d._ for cabbages, parsnips, and  potatoes; altogether 3_s._ 9_d._ This would produce a substantial dinner  for ten persons in family, and would, moreover, as children do not  require much meat when they have pudding, admit of there being enough  left to help out the next day's dinner, with potatoes.      No. 2. HOW TO BOIL BEEF.    Put the beef into your three or four gallon pot, three parts filled with  cold water, and set it on the fire to boil; remove all the scum that  rises to the surface, and then let it boil gently on the hob; when the  meat has boiled an hour and is about half done, add the parsnips in a  net, and at the end of another half hour put in the cabbages, also in a  net. A piece of beef weighing five or six pounds will require about two  hours' gentle boiling to cook it thoroughly. The dumplings may, of  course, be boiled with the beef, etc. I may here observe that the  dumplings and vegetables, with a small quantity of the meat, would be  all-sufficient for the children's meal.      No. 3. ECONOMICAL POT LIQUOR SOUP.    A thrifty housewife will not require that I should tell her to save the  liquor in which the beef has been boiled; I will therefore take it for  granted that the next day she carefully removes the grease, which will  have become set firm on the top of the broth, into her fat pot; this  must be kept to make a pie-crust, or to fry potatoes, or any remains of  vegetables, onions, or fish. The liquor must be tasted, and if it is  found to be too salt, some water must be added to lessen its saltness,  and render it palatable. The pot containing the liquor must then be  placed on the fire to boil, and when the scum rises to the surface it  should be removed with "]]]
