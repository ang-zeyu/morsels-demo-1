VOL. I. AUGUST, 1895 No. 8.    FRAGMENTS OF GREEK DETAIL.      The Art of Greece during the fifth century, B.C., was developed in an  amazingly short time from a condition of almost archaic rudeness to that  of the greatest perfection which the world has ever seen.    At the close of the Persian wars the Athenians, under Pericles, began  rebuilding their city and perfecting themselves in all the arts of  civilization, and their progress in the next half century will always be  a subject for wonder. It is especially wonderful that works of art of  the character produced at this time should have been the outcome of  political maneuvering: for if Plutarch is to be credited the scheming of  Pericles to obtain and hold possession of the government of Athens was  the immediate cause of the erection of these marvellous monuments. In  order to increase his influence with the common people Pericles devoted  the treasure which had been contributed by the other Greek cities for  defence against the barbarians to the beautifying of Athens, and to  furnishing them with games and amusements, and especially to the  erection of the group of temples upon the Acropolis, in this way  distributing patronage and keeping his people employed much as a modern  political \"boss\" does the same in our day.    The Parthenon, which is esteemed the grandest of all monuments of Greek  art, embodying as it does the highest achievement in sculpture and  architecture, was built just after the middle of the fifth century,  although the precise date at which it was begun and finished is  uncertain. The Erechtheion and Propylaea were probably built a few years  later, but their exact dates are also in doubt.    The sculptor, Phidias, was the friend and adviser of Pericles and to him  was given the general charge of all matters relating to art. Under him  were grouped architects, sculptors, and artisans of all schools and  trades--Ictinus and Calicrates as architects of the Parthenon, Mnesicles  of the Propylaea, and many others--such an assemblage as only Greece in  her most glorious epoch could bring together. The work of this period  shows that happy union of technical perfection and the expression of  only the loftiest ideas, in which, as Plutarch says, the architect made  it his ambition to \"surpass the magnificence of his design with the  elegance of its execution.\"    The skill and delicacy as well as the subtle appreciation of refinements  of form and finish exhibited in the treatment of details such as those  shown in our plates are almost beyond comprehension. The workmanship is  so perfect that it is difficult to see how it could be improved upon.  Stuart, in his account of the Parthenon, states that he found two  stones, one merely laid upon the other in the stylobate of this  building, which had been ground to so fine a joint that they had  actually united and become one. The refinements in measurements are such  that it has been asserted that a variation of one twentieth of an inch  from the dimensions intended is all that need be allowed--the width of  the two ends of the building agreeing to within this amount. The entasis  of columns and curvature of what would ordinarily be straight lines is  familiar to all students of architecture.    Photographs of Greek architecture are by no means common or easy to  obtain, and the subjects given as illustrations of the present issue of  THE BROCHURE SERIES are presented, not as in the preceding numbers,  either all from a single building, or of similar features from several  buildings, but merely as fragments of detail, representing the period of  Greek art when architecture and sculpture had reached their highest  development.          [Illustration: LVII. Capital from the Parthenon, Athens.]      LVII.    CAPITAL FROM THE PARTHENON, ATHENS.    The Parthenon of Pericles was built on the site of an older temple as a  treasury, and repository of the colossal statue of Athena, made by  Phidias from gold and ivory. The Doric order, the capital of which is  shown in our plate, needs no description here as probably no other  single order is so generally known. After various transformations the  building was blown up by the Venetians in 1687 and has since remained in  ruins.          [Illustration: LVIII. Capital from the Erechtheion, Athens.]    [Illustration: LIX. Base from the Erechtheion, Athens.]    [Illustration: LX. Capital of Anta, from the Erechtheion, Athens.]      LVIII.    CAPITAL FROM THE ERECHTHEION, ATHENS.    LIX.    BASE FROM THE ERECHTHEION, ATHENS.    LX.    CAP OF ANTA FROM THE ERECHTHEION, ATHENS.    The Ionic order of the Erechtheion is the one which is best known and  has been most frequently copied and adapted in modern work. It is at the  same time the richest and most delicately refined of the Greek Ionic  orders, and this is equivalent to saying of all orders whatsoever. This  order of which the cap and base are given in our plates belongs to the  north porch. There were two other fronts to the building which was, to  all intents and purposes, three temples united in one. The famous  caryatid porch faces the south, looking toward the Parthenon.          [Illustration: LXI. Fragment from South Side of the Acropolis, Athens.]      LXI.    FRAGMENT FROM SOUTH SIDE OF ACROPOLIS, ATHENS.    Although this fragment was found at some distance from the Erechtheion  it is without much doubt a portion of that building.          [Illustration: LXII. Capital from the Propylaea, Athens.]      LXII.    CAPITAL FROM THE PROPYLAEA, ATHENS.    The Propylaea, or gate to the Acropolis, was built at about the same time  as the Parthenon, between the years 436 and 431 B.C. It combines the  Doric and Ionic orders, but both are most skilfully used with equal  grace and nobleness of proportion.          [Illustration: LXIII. Fragment of Cyma from the Tholos, Epidauros.]      LXIII.    FRAGMENT OF CYMA FROM THE THOLOS AT EPIDAUROS.    The Tholos of Polykletos at Epidauros was a circular building 107 feet  in diameter, situated within the sacred enclosure. It had two concentric  rows of columns, the exterior order being Doric, and the interior Ionic,  but with Corinthian caps of the design shown in plate LXIV.          [Illustration: LXIV. Capital from the Tholos, Epidauros.]      LXIV.    CAP FROM THE THOLOS AT EPIDAUROS.    The two fragments shown are the result of recent excavations and are  among the most beautiful examples of Greek detail extant.          Architectural Schools.      HARVARD UNIVERSITY.    The writer of \"The Point of View\" in _Scribner's Magazine_ recently  called attention to the distinction between what he calls \"cultivation\"  and \"civilization.\" As he very aptly states it, \"culture according to  the common acceptance of it, is largely the cultivation of the mind;  civilization would seem to be the cultivation of the sympathies, the  tastes, and the capacity for giving and receiving sound pleasures. The  most civilized man is the man with the most catholic appreciation, the  man who can be the most things to the most people--the man, to put it  briefly, who knows best how to live. The man who is civilized can use  all the culture he can get, but he can get on and still be civilized  with a very moderate outfit of it. But the man who has culture and has  not civilization, is very badly handicapped.\"    Probably no walk of life offers more opportunities for the advantageous  application of what is meant in this quotation by civilization than that  of the architect; and probably in no other profession does the  \"civilized\" man have greater advantages over his less civilized fellows.    The successful architect requires a broad and catholic culture, but in  addition must be a man of the world in the best and most comprehensive  sense. Opportunities for social improvement will often make the  difference between success and failure in his professional life. On this  account too much stress can hardly be put upon the importance to a young  man of his social environment.    The life in an old university set in the midst of a community where the  traditions of generations of cultivated families have established a  social atmosphere, it might be said, is one of the best and most  powerful civilizing influences. Such an opportunity as this is offered  at Harvard, and it is this which gives to the architectural course at  Harvard its main advantage over that of other schools in this country.    The department itself is comparatively young, having only just completed  its second year. It is under the direction of the faculty of the  Lawrence Scientific School, one of the principal schools of the  University.    Its special corps of instructors consists of Prof. H. Langford Warren  assisted by Messrs. George F. Newton and John W. Bemis. In addition to  this, lectures and instruction are given by members of the Faculty of  Arts and Sciences, which includes the faculty of the Lawrence Scientific  School, Harvard College and the Graduate School, among whom are Prof.  Charles Eliot Norton, Prof. White, Prof. Greenough, Prof. Moore, Prof.  Hollis and others.    Although students in this department do much of their work in rooms  specially provided for them, in their general studies and lectures they  are associated with the other students of the University and thus reap  the advantages coming from such association.    Throughout, it has been the purpose in this school, to treat  architecture as a fine art and not merely as the science of  construction, and to this end instruction in the general history of the  Fine Arts and practice in design are made the central features about  which the other studies are grouped.    The course as laid out is intended to cover four years, and may be  supplemented by post-graduate work; while on the other hand a large  part of the general studies may be anticipated by students of the  College who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19780"],[0,"Report of the National Library Service for the Year Ended 31 March 1958 (#1)"],[1,"Zealand Parliamentary Library and the Online Distributed  Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                    [Coat of Arms]          REPORT    OF THE    NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICE    FOR THE YEAR ENDED    31 MARCH 1958      _Presented to the House of Representatives by Leave_      BY AUTHORITY: R.

Wellington, 16 July 1958.    SIR,    I have the honour to submit the following report of the activities of  the National Library Service. The report covers the work of the Service  as a whole and its four divisions--Country Library Service, School  Library Service, Library School, and National Library Centre.    The functions of the Service may be summed up as the provision of such  assistance to any New Zealand library maintained directly or indirectly  from public funds as circumstances and policy permit. More specifically,  help is given by a lending service to rural, borough, and county  libraries, by the provision of books for school libraries, by advancing  professional training through the Library School, and by maintenance of  records of all library holdings of books and periodicals, as well as  other facilities and stock to aid the cooperative use of this material.    The National Library Service was formed in 1945 from the Country Library  Service by Cabinet decision with the strong support of the New Zealand  Library Association. During the war the Country Library Service had been  given responsibility for several tasks of national scope, such as the  War Library Service, the Central Bureau for Library Book Imports, the  formation of a Union Catalogue, and the operation of part of the  inter-library loan scheme.    The Country Library Service, which began in 1938, has maintained  its van services to rural areas and has been brought into closer  contact with its districts by decentralisation to three district  offices--Christchurch in 1944, Palmerston North in 1948, and Hamilton  in 1953.    The number of free libraries regularly receiving service has grown to  112. Special assistance in a number of cases has been given to libraries  serving a population of up to 50,000 operating a free and rental  service. The assistance given to the Gisborne and Wanganui Public  Libraries has continued. New Plymouth Public Library which changed to  free service in November 1957, and Palmerston North Public Library,  which is expanding its service, have also received assistance. The  fundamental principle of encouraging full local responsibility for  adequate rate-supported libraries has continued.    The School Library Service has continued to bring a wide range and  variety of books to school children, the rate of issue now exceeding one  million copies annually. Distribution is effected through 15 centres.    During the year this Service received three valuable sets of books  chosen to represent all phases of American life and thought. The  Carnegie Corporation of New York made these sets available to some 26  libraries in New Zealand.    _Scientific, Technical, and Commercial Library Service_--A  recommendation has been made by the New Zealand Library Association that  impetus be given to scientific and technical library service, chiefly  through public libraries. At a time when increasing reliance is being  placed on the efficiency of our secondary industry the necessity of  providing the fullest technical information to aid manufacturers will be  apparent. Authority was obtained 12 years ago to establish such a  service but it was not then possible to obtain qualified persons to  begin it. It is hoped that conditions will permit a senior appointment  during the present financial year to inaugurate the service.    _Regional and District Library Service_--Study has continued on the  problems of ensuring an efficient and soundly based library service for  New Zealand's whole population. The problems facing a local authority  overseas with a population of 2,000,000 within a radius of a few miles  are minor ones compared with those facing New Zealand library  authorities, where the secondary cities are small, where the pattern of  local government is uneven, and where the population as a whole has a  high standard of education and is avid for books. Costs in New Zealand,  per head of population, are bound to be relatively high; vigilance is  necessary to ensure that they are no higher than they need be.    It has been apparent that cooperation between local authorities will be  the major factor in making economies on a national scale. A note of the  work of the Working Party on Library Cooperation of 27-28 August 1956  appeared in last year's annual report, and it was recorded that the  Minister of Education, at the request of the New Zealand Library  Association, had authorised payment of travelling expenses for its  Committee on Regional Planning to enable its work to be carried out.    The committee worked during the year and met in Wellington for two  full-day sessions on 6 and 7 June 1957 for consideration of the  \"establishment of regional and district library services as the best  method of providing a more effective library service for the whole  country\". Its report was made to the New Zealand Library Association.  After consideration by the executive of the Local Authorities Section,  some amendments were made and the report published by the Association as  _Co-operation: A New Phase_. Fifteen hundred copies were printed and  were circulated to all local authorities for discussion.    The report states:    \"1. The main problems facing public libraries are:         (i) The unfair distribution over the whole community of the costs           of library service.         (ii) The continuing growth of the cost of municipal government to            the point where it has become an embarrassment to the cities            and boroughs concerned.         (iii) The failure of some local authorities to provide for library             services.\"    \"8. The basic factor in improving library services will be cooperation  among local authorities. Such cooperation should be the condition of  increased Government assistance.\"    \"10. Government assistance to such federations should take the form of  cash subsidies on all expenditure approved for subsidy by the  federation, and by the Minister (or National Library Board).\"    This report formed the main topic of discussion at the New Zealand  Library Association conference in Invercargill in February 1958. The  Association approached the Government for favourable consideration of  the proposals contained in the report on 11 April 1958.    In the meantime the work of the Royal Commission on Local Government  Finance is being followed carefully, as its findings will have  considerable bearing on the problem of library finance.    An effort is also being made to foster among local authorities the  willingness to cooperate, but progress in this field is slow.    _National Library Proposal_--The report of the Working Party of the  Public Service Commission on the National Library proposal was earlier  considered by the Government, which had approved it in principle. The  House of Representatives last year approved the terms of reference of a  Select Committee to be appointed to make recommendations for \"ways and  means of carrying out the decision of the"]]]
