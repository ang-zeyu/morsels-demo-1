The doctor with whom he  is studying is rather a philanthropist for, instead of setting up trade  for the wealthy, in Harley Street, he is curing the poor for practically  nothing.    Dick's family circumstances take a turn for the worse, and he goes down  to the docks to work his passage to South Africa.  He has no idea how he  will proceed when he gets there, having no money, but he meets a rich  young man called Grosvenor on the ship, and, striking up a friendship,  they decide upon going together on a voyage of exploration.    After meeting a tribe whom this author, Collingwood, had written about  in a previous book, and sorting out various problems there, they proceed  on their way.  They had heard rumours of a mysterious white race living  not too far away, and they decide to investigate.  These turn out to be  one of the lost tribes of Israel.  They are eventually accepted there as  friends, after initially being taken prisoners.  Here again they are  able to sort out various problems.  Grosvenor marries the Queen, and  Dick, who in the course of these travels has managed to find some very  valuable jewels, eventually returns home with them.  He converts them  to cash, and is able to provide his poor old mother, whom he had left in  abject poverty, with a luxurious style of life.  He also puts lots of  money in the account of the doctor with whom he had been working before  these adventures began.  ________________________________________________________________________  DICK MAITLAND  A TALE OF UNKNOWN AFRICA    BY HARRY COLLINGWOOD        CHAPTER ONE.    THE CATASTROPHE.    Doctor Julian Humphreys was spoken of by those who believed that they  knew him best as an eccentric; because, being a physician and surgeon of  quite unusual ability, he chose--possessing a small independence  amounting to a bare three hundred pounds per annum--to establish himself  in the East-End of London, and there devote himself with zeal and  enthusiasm to the amelioration of the sufferings of the very poor,  instead of capitalising his income and setting up in Harley Street,  where his exceptional qualifications would speedily and inevitably have  brought him a handsome fortune.    An income of three hundred pounds per annum--out of which one has to  feed, clothe, and house oneself--does not afford very much scope for the  practice of philanthropy, as Dr Humphreys very well knew; his  establishment, therefore, was of very modest dimensions, consisting  merely of three rooms with the usual domestic offices, one room--the  front and largest one--being fitted up as surgery, dispensary, and  consulting room, while, of the other two, one served as a sleeping  apartment for himself and his pupil, Mr Richard Maitland, the third  being sacred to Polly Nevis, a sturdy and willing, but somewhat untidy  person, who discharged the united functions of parlour maid, housemaid,  chamber maid, cook, and scullery maid to the establishment.    The large red lamp which shone over Dr Humphreys' door at night was the  one and only picturesque feature of Paradise Street--surely so named by  an individual of singularly caustic and sardonic humour, for anything  less suggestive of the delights of Paradise than the squalid and  malodorous street so named it would indeed be difficult to conceive--and  in the course of the four years during which it had been in position  that lamp had become a familiar object to every man, woman, and child  within a radius of at least a mile; for the Doctor's fame had soon  spread, and his clientele comprised practically everybody within that  radius.    The apparently insignificant event that initiated the extraordinary  series of adventures, of which this is the narrative, occurred about the  hour of 8 a.m. on a certain day of September in the year of our Lord  19--; and it consisted in the delivery by the postman of a letter  addressed to Mr Richard Maitland, care of Dr J.  Humphreys, 19  Paradise Street, Whitechapel, E.  The letter was addressed in the well-  known handwriting of Dick's mother; but the recipient did not  immediately open it, for he was at the moment engaged in assisting the  Doctor to dress and bind up the wounds of Mrs William Taylor, whose  husband, having returned home furiously drunk upon the closing of the  public houses on the previous night, had proceeded to vent his spleen  upon his long-suffering wife, because, having no money and nothing that  she could pawn, she had failed to have a hot supper ready for him upon  his arrival.    When, however, Mrs Taylor, scarcely recognisable because of the  voluminous bandages that swathed her head and face, and carrying with  her a powerful odour of iodoform, was bowed out of the surgery by Dr  Humphreys, with a reminder--in reply to a murmur that she had no money  just then--that she was one of his free patients, and a message from the  Doctor to Mr William Taylor, which the poor woman had not the remotest  intention to deliver, Dick drew his mother's letter from his pocket and  opened it.  As he mastered its contents he went white to the lips, as  well he might; for this is what he read:                                                                 The Cedars,                                                  14 South Hill, Sydenham.                                                   _September 10th, 19--_.      \"My dear Dick,--      \"I am sorry to be obliged to call you away from your work, but I must    ask you to please come home to me as soon as you can possibly get    away, for I have just received news of so disastrous a character that    I dare not put it upon paper.  Besides, I am so distracted that I    scarcely know what I am writing, as you will no doubt understand when    I tell you that we are ruined--absolutely and irretrievably ruined!    Come as soon as you can, my dear, for I feel as though I shall go out    of my senses if I cannot soon have someone to counsel me as to what is    the best thing to be done under these dreadful circumstances.      \"Your loving but distracted mother,--      \"Edith Maitland.\"    \"Hillo, Dick! what's the matter?\" exclaimed the Doctor, catching a  glimpse of his assistant's drawn face and pallid lips as Maitland stared  incredulously at the letter in his hand.  \"Nothing wrong, I hope.  You  look as though you had just seen a ghost!\"    \"So I have; the ghosts of--many things,\" answered Dick.  \"Unless this  letter is--but no, it is the dear Mater's own handwriting beyond a  doubt.  Read it, Doctor; there are no secrets in it.\"  And Dick passed  the letter over to Humphreys.    \"Phew!\" whistled the Doctor, when he had read the letter twice--from the  date to the signature; \"that sounds pretty bad.  You had better be off  at once, and get at the rights of the thing.  And when you have done  so-- By the way, have you any friends with whom you can consult, should  you need help or advice of any sort?\"    \"Not a soul in the world, so far as I know, unless I may call you a  friend, Doctor,\" answered Dick.  \"Of course there is Cuthbertson, the  family solicitor and the sole executor of my father's will; but the  suggestion conveyed by this letter from my mother is that something has  somehow gone wrong with him, and he may not be available.\"    \"Quite so; he may not, as you say,\" agreed the Doctor.  \"In that case,  my dear Dick, come back to me after you have become acquainted with all  the facts, and we will discuss the matter together.  That you may call  me your friend goes without saying, as you ought to know by this time;  and although I am only an obscure East-End practitioner I am not wholly  without friends able and willing to do me, or any friend of mine, a good  turn, if necessary.  So come back here when you have threshed out the  matter, and we will see what--if anything--can be done.\"    \"Right!  I will.  And a thousand thanks to you for this fresh evidence  of your kindly feeling toward me,\" exclaimed Dick, grasping the doctor's  hand.  \"Are you quite sure that you will be able to get along without me  for a few hours?\"    \"Absolutely certain,\" was the cheery reply.  \"You are a very clever  young fellow, Dick, and have proved a marvellously apt pupil since you  have been with me, but I managed this practice single-handed before you  came to me, and I have no doubt I can do it again, if needs be.  So be  off with you at once, my lad; for your mother seems to be in sore need  of you.\"    Five minutes later Dick Maitland had boarded a tramcar, on his way to  London Bridge railway station, from whence he took train for the Crystal  Palace, the nearest station to his mother's home, which he reached  within two hours of his departure from Number 19 Paradise Street.    Now, as Dick Maitland happens to be the hero of this story it is  necessary he should be properly introduced to the reader, and this seems  as appropriate a moment as any.    To begin with, then, when we caught our first glimpse of him, assisting  Dr Humphreys to dress and bind up those tokens of affection which Mr  William Taylor had bestowed upon his wife, Dick Maitland was within  three months of his eighteenth birthday, a fine, tall, fairly good-  looking, and athletic specimen of the young public-school twentieth-  century Englishman.  He was an only son; and his mother was a widow, her  husband having died when Dick was a sturdy little toddler a trifle over  three years of age.  Mrs Maitland had been left quite comfortably off,  her husband having accumulated a sufficient sum to bring her in an  income of close upon seven hundred pounds per annum.  The provisions of  Mr Maitland's will stipulated that the income arising from his  carefully chosen investments was to be enjoyed by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#1)"],[1,"Middy of the Slave Squadron  A West African Story    By Harry Collingwood  ________________________________________________________________________  This was one of the last books written by \"Harry Collingwood\".  The copy  we worked from was very clearly printed, but with one very major  problem - the text was printed far too close to the centre of the book.  Therefore the book could not be scanned using the regular book-scanner,  but rather it was done using the scanner in flat-bed mode.  However, the  results were quite good, with the text coming through very clearly, and  only the hyphens needing a good amount of checking.  The hyphens get  affected by the cleaning-up process which takes out the unwanted dark  patches on the scans.    The book is exactly according to the title.  Remembering that \"Harry  Collingwood\" was in real life a naval architect, you can take good note  of the way he handles nautical terminology.  Other contemporary authors  were good, but in this respect Collingwood is a real master.    It makes a good audiobook, so you ought to enjoy it very greatly.  NH.  ________________________________________________________________________  A MIDDY OF THE SLAVE SQUADRON  A WEST AFRICAN STORY    BY HARRY COLLINGWOOD        CHAPTER ONE.    A SOUND THROUGH THE DARKNESS.    \"Phew!\" ejaculated Mr Perry, first lieutenant of His Britannic  Majesty's corvette _Psyche_, as he removed his hat and mopped the  perspiration from his streaming forehead with an enormous spotted  pocket-handkerchief.  \"I believe it's getting hotter instead of cooler;  although, by all the laws that are supposed to govern this pestiferous  climate, we ought to be close upon the coolest hour of the twenty-four!  Just step aft to the skylight, Mr Fortescue, and see what the time is,  will ye?  It must surely be nearing two bells.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir!\"  I dutifully answered; and, moving aft to the skylight,  raised the canvas cover which had been placed over it to mask the light  of the low-turned lamp which was kept burning all night in the fore  cabin, and glanced at the clock which, screwed to the coaming on one  side of the tell-tale compass, balanced the barometer which, hung in  gimbals, was suspended on the other side.  The clock marked the time as  two minutes to five a.m., or within two minutes of two bells in the  morning watch.    Dropping the canvas screen back into place, I was about to announce the  time to my superior officer, when I thought I caught, through the faint  creak of the ship's timbers and the light rustling of the canvas aloft,  a slight, far off sound, like the squeak of a sheave on a rusty pin.  Therefore, instead of proclaiming the time aloud, I stepped quietly to  the side of the first luff, and asked, almost in a whisper--    \"Did you hear anything just then, sir?\"    \"Hear anything?\" reiterated Mr Perry, unconsciously lowering his  usually stentorian voice in response to the suggestion of secrecy  conveyed by my whisper; \"no, I can't say that I did.  What d'ye mean,  Mr Fortescue?\"    \"I mean, sir,\" I replied, \"that I thought I caught, a moment ago, a  sound like that of--ah! did you hear _that_, then, sir?\" as a voice,  uttering some words of command, apparently in the Spanish language, came  floating to us, faint but clear, across the invisible water upon which  the _Psyche_ lay rolling almost imperceptibly.    \"Ay, I did,\" answered Mr Perry, modulating his voice still further.  \"No mistake about that, eh?  There's a craft of some sort out there,  less than a mile distant, I should say.  Did you catch the words?  They  sounded to me like some foreign lingo.\"    \"No, sir,\" I replied, \"I did not quite catch them, but, as you say, they  appeared to be foreign, and I believe they were Spanish.  What about  striking two bells, sir?  It only wanted two minutes--\"    \"On no account whatever, Mr Fortescue,\" hastily interrupted my  companion.  \"On the contrary, have the kindness to slip for'ard and  caution the watch not to sing out, or make the slightest noise, on any  account, but to come quietly aft if they happen to have anything to  report.  And when you have done that, kindly go down and call Captain  Harrison.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir!\"  I answered; and, kicking off my shoes, lest the sound of  them upon the deck should reach the stranger through that still and  breathless atmosphere, I proceeded upon my twofold errand.    But it is time to tell the reader where the _Psyche_ was upon this dark  and stifling night; what she was doing there; and why the precautions  above referred to were deemed necessary.    As has already been mentioned, the _Psyche_ was a British man-o'-war.  She was a sloop, armed with fourteen long 18-pounders; and carried a  crew which had originally consisted of one hundred and thirty men, but  which had now been reduced by sickness and casualties to one hundred and  four, all told.  She was a unit in the somewhat scanty Slave Squadron  which Great Britain had stationed on the West African coast for the  suppression of the infamous slave-trade; and when this story opens--  namely, about the middle of the year 1822--had been upon the station  nearly two years, during the whole of which period I, Richard Fortescue,  hailing from the neighbourhood of the good town of Plymouth, had been on  board her, and now held the responsible position of senior midshipman;  being, at the above date, just turned seventeen years of age.    The _Psyche_ was a fine, stout, roomy, and comfortable craft of her  class; but about as unsuitable for the work upon which she was now  engaged as could well be, for she was a converted merchant ship, built  for the purpose of carrying the biggest possible cargo that could be  packed into certain prescribed limits, and consequently, as might be  expected, phenomenally slow.  To commission such a vessel to chase and  capture the nimble craft that were usually employed to transport the  unhappy blacks across the Atlantic was simply a ghastly farce, and  caused us, her unfortunate crew, to be the laughing-stock of the entire  coast.  Yet, considering all things, we had not done so very badly; for  realising, early in the commission, that we need never hope for success  from the speed of our ship, we had invoked the aid of strategy, and by  dint of long practice had brought the trapping of slavers almost up to  the level of high art.  Consequently the _Psyche_, despite the  disabilities arising from her astonishing lack of speed, had acquired a  certain reputation among the slave-dealing fraternity, and was as  intensely detested by them as any ship on the station.    At the moment when the reader first finds himself a member of her crew  the _Psyche_ was lying near the mouth of the Benin river, some two miles  off the shore and about twice that distance from the river's mouth, at  which point we had arrived at midnight; having made our way thither in  consequence of \"information received,\" which led us to believe that a  large ship was at that moment in the river taking on board a full cargo  of blacks.  We had drifted down to the position which we then occupied  under the impulse of the last of the land-breeze, which had died out and  left us becalmed some two miles short of the precise spot for which we  were aiming.  Still, we were near enough for all practical purposes, or  believed that we were; for we thought that if a thoroughly smart look-  out were maintained--and we had grown to be adepts at that sort of  thing--it would be impossible for a slaver to attempt to slip out of the  river without our becoming cognisant of the fact.  And now, to return to  my story.    Having first stolen forward and warned the watch that a craft of some  sort was within hearing distance of us, and that they were therefore  carefully to avoid crying out, or making any other sound that might  betray our presence, I returned aft, in the same cautious manner, and  was on the point of descending the companion ladder to call the captain,  when _ting-ting_ came the soft chiming of a ship's bell, mellowed by  distance, from somewhere in the offing, evidencing--or so it seemed to  me--the fact that the stranger had not as yet discovered our proximity.    The skipper, accustomed to being disturbed at all hours of the night,  awoke at the first touch of my knuckles upon his cabin door.    \"Yes!\" he called; \"what is it?\"    \"There is a strange craft not far from us, sir,\" I answered; \"and Mr  Perry considered that you should be apprised of the fact.  We know  nothing whatever about her, except that she is there; for the night is  so intensely dark that we have been unable to catch the faintest glimpse  of her, but we have just heard them strike two bells aboard her.  We  have not struck our own bell, sir, thinking--\"    \"Yes, of course, quite right,\" interrupted the skipper, as he landed  with a soft thud on the floor of his state-room.  \"Tell Mr Perry that  I'll be on deck in a brace of shakes.\"    He followed close at my heels up the companion ladder, having paused  only long enough to slip into his nether garments, and came groping  blindly out on deck.    \"Phew!\" he muttered, as he emerged from the companion; \"it's as dark as  the inside of a cow.  Where are you, Mr Perry?\"    \"Here I am, sir; close alongside you,\" answered the first luff,  stretching out his hand and lightly touching the skipper's arm.  \"Yes,\"  he continued, \"it certainly _is_ dark, unusually so; so dark that I am  in hopes of keeping our presence a secret from the fellow out yonder  until you shall have decided what is to be done.\"    \"Mr Fortescue tells me that you have not seen anything of him thus  far,\" remarked the captain.  \"Whereabout is he, and how far off, do you  reckon?\"    \"Somewhere away in that direction,\" indicated the lieutenant, with a  flourish of his arm.  \"As to the distance--well, that is rather  difficult to judge.  Sound travels far on such a night as this; but I  should say that the craft is not"]]]
