CLARK, M.A., F.S.A.    REGISTRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND    FORMERLY FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.        CAMBRIDGE:    MACMILLAN AND BOWES.    1894              _The lecture was illustrated by lantern-slides. A brief notice      of each of these is printed in the text in Italics at the      place in the lecture where the slide was exhibited._          LIBRARIES.      A library may be considered from two very different points of view: as a  workshop, or as a Museum.    The former commends itself to the practical turn of mind characteristic of  the present day; common sense urges that mechanical ingenuity, which has  done so much in other directions, should be employed in making the  acquisition of knowledge less cumbrous and less tedious; that as we travel  by steam, so we should also read by steam, and be helped in our studies by  the varied resources of modern invention. There lies on my table at this  present moment a _Handbook of Library Appliances_, in which fifty-three  closely printed pages are devoted to this interesting subject, with  illustrations of various contrivances by which the working of a large  library is to be facilitated and brought up to date. In fact, from this  point of view a library may be described as a gigantic mincing-machine,  into which the labours of the past are flung, to be turned out again in a  slightly altered form as the literature of the present.    If, on the other hand, a library be regarded as a Museum--and I use the  word in its original sense as a temple or haunt of the Muses--very  different ideas are evoked. Such a place is as useful as the other--every  facility for study is given--but what I may call the personal element as  affecting the treasures there assembled is brought prominently forward.  The development of printing, as the result of individual effort; the art  of bookbinding, as practised by different persons in different countries;  the history of the books themselves, the libraries in which they have  found a home, the hands that have turned their pages, are there taken  note of. Modern literature is fully represented, but the men of past days  are not thrust out of sight; their footsteps seem to linger in the rooms  where once they walked--their shades seem to protect the books they once  handled. What Browning felt about frescoes may be applied--_mutatis  mutandis_--to books in such an asylum as I am trying to portray:        Wherever a fresco peels and drops,        Wherever an outline weakens and wanes      Till the latest life in the painting stops,        Stands One whom each fainter pulse-tick pains:      One, wishful each scrap should clutch the brick,        Each tinge not wholly escape the plaster,      A lion who dies of an ass's kick,        The wronged great soul of an ancient Master.    It may be safely asserted that at no time has a love of reading, a desire  to be fairly well-informed on all sorts of subjects, been so widely  diffused as at the present day. As a necessary consequence of this the  'workshop' view of a library has been very generally accepted. I have no  wish to undervalue it; I only plead for the recognition of another  sentiment which may at times be overlaid by the pressure of daily  avocations. In Cambridge, at least, there is no fear that it should ever  be obliterated altogether, for we have effected a happy alliance between  the present and the past, by which neither is neglected, neither is unduly  prominent. This being the case, it has occurred to me that I may be so  fortunate as to interest a Cambridge audience while I set before them some  of the results at which I have arrived in investigating the position, the  arrangement, and the fittings of libraries in the medieval and renaissance  periods. It will, of course, be impossible to attempt more than a sketch  of so extensive a subject, and I fear that I must omit the contents of the  bookcases altogether; but I shall hope, by a selection of typical  illustrations, to make you realise what some of the libraries, monastic,  public, or private, that fall within my period were like.    I must begin with a few words about Roman libraries, because their methods  influenced the Middle Ages, and are, in fact, the precursors of those in  fashion in our own times. The Romans preserved their books in two ways:  either in a small room or closet, for reading elsewhere; or in a large  apartment, fitted up with greater or less splendour, according to the  taste or the means of the possessor, in which the books were doubtless  studied as in a modern library. An instructive example of the former class  was one of the first discoveries at Herculaneum in 1754. It was a very  small room, so small in fact that a man who stood with his arms extended  in the centre of it could almost touch the walls on either side, yet 1700  rolls were found in it. These were kept in wooden presses (_armaria_)  which stood against the walls like a modern bookcase. Besides these a  rectangular case occupied the central space, with only a narrow passage to  the right and left between it and the wall-cases. These cases were about  a man's height, and had been numbered. It may be concluded from this that  a catalogue of the books had once existed. In larger libraries the books  were kept in similar presses, but they were ornamented with the busts or  pictures of illustrious men, under each of which was a suitable  inscription, usually in verse.    No ancient figure of one of these book-presses has been preserved, so far  as I have been able to ascertain; but, as furniture is apt to retain its  original forms with but little variation for a very long period, a  representation of a press containing the four Gospels, which occurs among  the mosaics in the Mausoleum of the Empress Galla Placidia at Ravenna,  though it could not have been executed before the middle of the fifth  century, may be taken as a fairly accurate picture of the book-presses of  an earlier age. It is unnecessary to describe it, for it is exactly like a  still later example which I am about to shew you. This picture occurs at  the beginning of the MS. of the Vulgate called the _Codex Amiatinus_,  which is now proved to have been written in England, at Wearmouth or  Jarrow, but probably by an Italian scribe, shortly before 716. The seated  figure represents Ezra writing the Law.      _Bookcase in the Codex Amiatinus: from Garrucci, \"Storia dell' arte  Cristiana,\"_ iii. pl. 126.    To get an idea of one of the larger Roman libraries in ancient times we  cannot do better than turn to that of the Vatican at the present day. It  was fitted up as we see it now--with presses, busts, and antique vases, by  Pope Sixtus V., in 1588. It is therefore, at best, only a modern antique;  but arranged so skilfully that an ancient Roman, if he could come to life  again, might imagine himself in his own library.      _Interior of part of the Vatican Library._      The library-era, as we may call it, of the Christian world, began with the  publication of the Rule of S. Benedict, early in the sixth century. But,  just as that Rule emphasized and arranged on the lines of an ordered  system observances which had long been practised by isolated congregations  or individuals living in solitude--so the part of it which deals with  study was evidently no new thing. S. Benedict did not invent literature or  libraries; he only lent the sanction of his name to the study of the one  and the formation of the other. That libraries existed before his period  is proved by allusions to them in the Fathers and other early writers;  but, as those allusions are general, and say nothing from which either  their size or their arrangement can be inferred, I shall dismiss them in  very few sentences. The earliest is said to have been the collection got  together at Jerusalem, by Bishop Alexander, at the beginning of the third  century. Another was founded about fifty years later at Caesarea by  Origen. This is described as not only extensive, but remarkable for the  importance of the manuscripts it contained. Others are recorded at Hippo,  at Cirta, at Constantinople, and at Rome, where both S. Peter's and the  Lateran had their special collections of books. I suspect that all these  libraries were in connexion with churches, possibly actually within their  walls. At Cirta, for example, it is recorded that during the persecution  of 303-304 the officers \"went to the church where the Christians used to  assemble, and spoiled it of chalices, lamps, etc., but when they came into  the library (_bibliothecam_), the presses (_armaria_) there were found  empty.\" This language seems to imply that the sacred vessels and the books  were in different parts of the same building. The instructions, again, of  the dying Augustine, who bequeathed his library to the church at Hippo,  lead to the same conclusion. The library of S. Peter's at Rome, though  added to the basilica erected by Constantine, long after its primitive  foundation, was on the ground-floor in the angle between the nave and the  north limb of the transept, a position which may perhaps have been  selected in accordance with early usage.    I now pass to the treatment of books in the libraries of the monastic  orders. These either adopted the Rule of S. Benedict, or based their own  Rule upon its provisions. It will therefore be desirable to examine what  he said on the subject of study, and I will translate a few lines from the  48th chapter of his Rule, _Of daily manual labour_.        Idleness is the enemy of the soul; hence brethren ought, at      certain seasons, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19420"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of York (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: York Minster, the West Front and Nave.]               THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF                  YORK       A DESCRIPTION OF ITS FABRIC     AND A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE        ARCHI-EPISCOPAL SEE                   BY          A.

The aim of each writer has been to produce a work  compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the  student of Archaeology and History, and yet not too technical in  language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.    To specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case  would be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general  sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful  are:--(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in  questions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2)  the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the  Transactions of the Antiquarian and Archaeological Societies; (3) the  important documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master  of the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the  English Cathedrals; and (5) the very excellent series of Handbooks to  the Cathedrals originated by the late Mr John Murray; to which the  reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in  reference to the histories of the respective sees.

Professor Willis made careful and extensive observations of the Crypt  and other parts of the Minster during the restoration, which gave him  opportunities for investigation now impossible. He also brought to these  observations a learning and sagacity probably greater than those of any  other writer on English Gothic Architecture, and his little book remains  the standard work on the history of the Minster.    I regret that I have been unable to agree with several of the theories  of that most enthusiastic and diligent writer, Mr John Browne, or even  to discuss them as I should have liked; but his books must always be of  great value to every one interested in the history of York. I am also  indebted to Canon Raine's excellent works and compilations; to Mr  Winston for his remarks on the glass in the Minster; and to Professor  Freeman for his interesting criticisms of the fabric generally.

Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose knowledge of Britain before the Roman  occupation is not shared by our modern historians, gives the following  account of its beginning:--\"Ebraucus, son of Mempricius, the third king  from Brute, did build a city north of Humber, which from his own name,  he called Kaer Ebrauc--that is, the City of Ebraucus--about the time  that David ruled in Judea.\" Thus, by tradition, as both Romulus and  Ebraucus were descended from Priam, Rome and York are sister cities; and  York is the older of the two. One can understand the eagerness of Drake,  the historian of York, to believe the story. According to him the verity  of Geoffrey's history has been excellently well vindicated, but in  Drake's time romance was preferred to evidence almost as easily as in  Geoffrey's, and he gives us no facts to support his belief, for the very  good reason that he has none to give.    Abandoning, therefore, the account of Geoffrey of Monmouth, we are  reduced to these facts and surmises. Before the Roman invasion the  valley of the Ouse was in the hands of a tribe called the Brigantes, who  probably had a settlement on or near the site of the present city of  York. Tools of flint and bronze and vessels of clay have been found in  the neighbourhood. The Brigantes, no doubt, waged intermittent war upon  the neighbouring tribes, and on the wolds surrounding the city are to be  found barrows and traces of fortifications to which they retired from  time to time for safety. The position of York would make it a favourable  one for a settlement. It stands at the head of a fertile and pleasant  valley and on the banks of a tidal river. Possibly there were tribal  settlements on the eastern wolds in the neighbourhood in earlier and  still more barbarous times, before the Brigantes found it safe to make a  permanent home in the valley, but this is all conjecture. It is not  until the Roman conquest of Britain that York enters into history. The  Brigantes were subdued between the years 70 and 80 A.D. by Patilius  Cerealis and Agricola. The Romans called the city by the name of  Eburacum. The derivation is not known. It has been suggested that it was  taken from the river Ure, a tributary of the Ouse, but variations of the  word are common in the Roman Empire, as, for example, Eburobriga,  Eburodunum, and the Eburovices. These are probably all derived from some  common Celtic word. In process of time, perhaps in the reign of the"]]]
