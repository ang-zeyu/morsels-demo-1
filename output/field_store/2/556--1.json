I am a native of _____, in the United States of America. My ancestors  migrated from England in the reign of Charles II.; and my grandfather  was not undistinguished in the War of Independence. My family,  therefore, enjoyed a somewhat high social position in right of birth;  and being also opulent, they were considered disqualified for the public  service. My father once ran for Congress, but was signally defeated by  his tailor. After that event he interfered little in politics, and lived  much in his library. I was the eldest of three sons, and sent at the age  of sixteen to the old country, partly to complete my literary education,  partly to commence my commercial training in a mercantile firm at  Liverpool. My father died shortly after I was twenty-one; and being left  well off, and having a taste for travel and adventure, I resigned, for  a time, all pursuit of the almighty dollar, and became a desultory  wanderer over the face of the earth.    In the year 18__, happening to be in _____, I was invited by a  professional engineer, with whom I had made acquaintance, to visit the  recesses of the ________ mine, upon which he was employed.    The reader will understand, ere he close this narrative, my reason for  concealing all clue to the district of which I write, and will perhaps  thank me for refraining from any description that may tend to its  discovery.    Let me say, then, as briefly as possible, that I accompanied the  engineer into the interior of the mine, and became so strangely  fascinated by its gloomy wonders, and so interested in my friend's  explorations, that I prolonged my stay in the neighbourhood, and  descended daily, for some weeks, into the vaults and galleries hollowed  by nature and art beneath the surface of the earth. The engineer was  persuaded that far richer deposits of mineral wealth than had yet been  detected, would be found in a new shaft that had been commenced under  his operations. In piercing this shaft we came one day upon a chasm  jagged and seemingly charred at the sides, as if burst asunder at some  distant period by volcanic fires. Down this chasm my friend caused  himself to be lowered in a 'cage,' having first tested the atmosphere  by the safety-lamp. He remained nearly an hour in the abyss. When he  returned he was very pale, and with an anxious, thoughtful expression  of face, very different from its ordinary character, which was open,  cheerful, and fearless.    He said briefly that the descent appeared to him unsafe, and leading to  no result; and, suspending further operations in the shaft, we returned  to the more familiar parts of the mine.    All the rest of that day the engineer seemed preoccupied by some  absorbing thought. He was unusually taciturn, and there was a scared,  bewildered look in his eyes, as that of a man who has seen a ghost. At  night, as we two were sitting alone in the lodging we shared together  near the mouth of the mine, I said to my friend,--    \"Tell me frankly what you saw in that chasm: I am sure it was something  strange and terrible. Whatever it be, it has left your mind in a state  of doubt. In such a case two heads are better than one. Confide in me.\"      The engineer long endeavoured to evade my inquiries; but as, while he  spoke, he helped himself unconsciously out of the brandy-flask to a  degree to which he was wholly unaccustomed, for he was a very temperate  man, his reserve gradually melted away. He who would keep himself to  himself should imitate the dumb animals, and drink water. At last he  said, \"I will tell you all. When the cage stopped, I found myself on  a ridge of rock; and below me, the chasm, taking a slanting direction,  shot down to a considerable depth, the darkness of which my lamp could  not have penetrated. But through it, to my infinite surprise, streamed  upward a steady brilliant light. Could it be any volcanic fire? In that  case, surely I should have felt the heat. Still, if on this there was  doubt, it was of the utmost importance to our common safety to clear it  up. I examined the sides of the descent, and found that I could venture  to trust myself to the irregular projection of ledges, at least for some  way. I left the cage and clambered down. As I drew nearer and nearer to  the light, the chasm became wider, and at last I saw, to my unspeakable  amaze, a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss, illumined as far  as the eye could reach by what seemed artificial gas-lamps placed at  regular intervals, as in the thoroughfare of a great city; and I heard  confusedly at a distance a hum as of human voices. I know, of course,  that no rival miners are at work in this district. Whose could be those  voices? What human hands could have levelled that road and marshalled  those lamps?    \"The superstitious belief, common to miners, that gnomes or fiends dwell  within the bowels of the earth, began to seize me. I shuddered at the  thought of descending further and braving the inhabitants of this nether  valley. Nor indeed could I have done so without ropes, as from the spot  I had reached to the bottom of the chasm the sides of the rock sank down  abrupt, smooth, and sheer. I retraced my steps with some difficulty. Now  I have told you all.\"    \"You will descend again?\"    \"I ought, yet I feel as if I durst not.\"    \"A trusty companion halves the journey and doubles the courage. I will  go with you. We will provide ourselves with ropes of suitable length and  strength--and--pardon me--you must not drink more to-night, our hands  and feet must be steady and firm tomorrow.\"        Chapter II.      With the morning my friend's nerves were rebraced, and he was not  less excited by curiosity than myself. Perhaps more; for he evidently  believed in his own story, and I felt considerable doubt of it; not that  he would have wilfully told an untruth, but that I thought he must have  been under one of those hallucinations which seize on our fancy or our  nerves in solitary, unaccustomed places, and in which we give shape to  the formless and sound to the dumb.    We selected six veteran miners to watch our descent; and as the cage  held only one at a time, the engineer descended first; and when he had  gained the ledge at which he had before halted, the cage rearose for me.  I soon gained his side. We had provided ourselves with a strong coil of  rope.    The light struck on my sight as it had done the day before on my  friend's. The hollow through which it came sloped diagonally: it seemed  to me a diffused atmospheric light, not like that from fire, but soft  and silvery, as from a northern star. Quitting the cage, we descended,  one after the other, easily enough, owing to the juts in the side, till  we reached the place at which my friend had previously halted, and which  was a projection just spacious enough to allow us to stand abreast. From  this spot the chasm widened rapidly like the lower end of a vast funnel,  and I saw distinctly the valley, the road, the lamps which my companion  had described. He had exaggerated nothing. I heard the sounds he had  heard--a mingled indescribable hum as of voices and a dull tramp as of  feet. Straining my eye farther down, I clearly beheld at a distance the  outline of some large building. It could not be mere natural rock, it  was too symmetrical, with huge heavy Egyptian-like columns, and the  whole lighted as from within. I had about me a small pocket-telescope,  and by the aid of this, I could distinguish, near the building I  mention, two forms which seemed human, though I could not be sure. At  least they were living, for they moved, and both vanished within the  building. We now proceeded to attach the end of the rope we had brought  with us to the ledge on which we stood, by the aid of clamps and  grappling hooks, with which, as well as with necessary tools, we were  provided.    We were almost silent in our work. We toiled like men afraid to speak to  each other. One end of the rope being thus apparently made firm to the  ledge, the other, to which we fastened a fragment of the rock, rested on  the ground below, a distance of some fifty feet. I was a younger man and  a more active man than my companion, and having served on board ship in  my boyhood, this mode of transit was more familiar to me than to him. In  a whisper I claimed the precedence, so that when I gained the ground I  might serve to hold the rope more steady for his descent. I got safely  to the ground beneath, and the engineer now began to lower himself.  But he had scarcely accomplished ten feet of the descent, when the  fastenings, which we had fancied so secure, gave way, or rather the  rock itself proved treacherous and crumbled beneath the strain; and the  unhappy man was precipitated to the bottom, falling just at my feet,  and bringing down with his fall splinters of the rock, one of which,  fortunately but a small one, struck and for the time stunned me. When I  recovered my senses I saw my companion an inanimate mass beside me,  life utterly extinct. While I was bending over his corpse in grief and  horror, I heard close at hand a strange sound between a snort and a  hiss; and turning instinctively to the quarter from which it came, I saw  emerging from a dark fissure in the rock a vast and terrible head,  with open jaws and dull, ghastly, hungry eyes--the head of a monstrous  reptile resembling that of the crocodile or alligator, but infinitely  larger than the largest creature of that kind I had ever beheld in my  travels. I started to my feet and fled down the valley at my utmost  speed. I stopped at last, ashamed of my panic and my flight, and  returned to the spot on which I had left the body of my friend. It  was gone; doubtless the monster had already drawn it into its den and  devoured it. The rope and the grappling-hooks still lay where they had  fallen, but they afforded me no chance of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

WIMBORNE MINSTER AND CHRISTCHURCH PRIORY    A Short History of Their Foundation and Description of Their Buildings    by    THE REV. THOMAS PERKINS  M.A., F.R.A.S.  Rector of Turnworth, Dorset    With Illustrations from Photographs by the Author                [Illustration]        London George Bell & Sons 1902  First Edition 1899  Second Edition, Revised, 1902          AUTHOR'S PREFACE      When writing the chapters of the present volume which treat of Wimborne  Minster, the author consulted the last edition of Hutchins' \"History of  Dorset,\" which contains a considerable amount of somewhat ill-arranged  information on the subject, verifying all the descriptions by actual  examination of the building; similarly, when preparing the part of  this volume dealing with Christchurch Priory, he made some use of  \"The Memorials of Christchurch Twynham,\" written originally by the Rev.  Mackenzie Walcott, F.S.A., and revised after his death in 1880 by Mr B.  Edmund Ferrey, F.S.A. He also consulted papers on the subject that have  appeared from time to time in various periodicals and MSS. that were  kindly placed at his disposal by the Secretary of the Society for the  Protection of Ancient Buildings.    He desires to express his thanks to the Vicars of the two churches  for permission to thoroughly examine every part of the buildings,  and to photograph them without let or hindrance; he also wishes to bear  testimony to the readiness shown by the clerks and vergers in imparting  local information and in facilitating his photographic work.
