Rhoda has been brought up as the child of rich parents. Her  brothers have done well, but she has been kept at home, and has been  taught by governesses and other visiting tutors.  The German fraulein  goes to her own home in Germany for a holiday, where she gets married  and never comes back.    This prompts Mr Chester to consider sending Rhoda away to a boarding  school.  There is a discussion, Rhoda's mother not being at all in  favour of the idea, but Rhoda is keen to go.    They settle on a school.  Rhoda goes there, and enjoys herself, doing  well.  Tom and the other girls are of course her schoolmates.  But there  is to be an important exam, for which Rhoda overworks, to the point  where her brain  no longer works when she is in the examination hall.  So life is downward, instead of upward, she realises.  We will leave  you to read the rest of the story.  Vaizey is at her best again.

A CHANGE.    \"Yes, she must go to school!\" repeated Mr Chester.    A plaintive sob greeted his words from the neighbourhood of the sofa.  For once in her life Mrs Chester's kindly, good-tempered face had lost  its smiles, and was puckered up into lines of distress.  She let one  fat, be-ringed hand drop to her side and wander restlessly over the  satin skirt in search of a pocket.  Presently out came a handkerchief,  which was applied to each eye in turn, and came away bedewed with tears.    \"It will break my heart to part from her!\" she faltered.  Her husband  laughed with masculine scepticism.    \"Oh, nonsense, dear,\" he said; \"hearts are not so easily broken.  You  are too sensible to grieve over what is for the child's good, and will  get used to the separation, as other mothers have done before you.  It  will be the making of Rhoda to leave home for a few years, to mix with  other girls, and find her level.  She is getting an altogether  exaggerated idea of her own importance!\"    \"Her level, indeed!  Find her level!  I should like to know the school  where you could find another girl like her!\" cried the mother, in a tone  which showed plainly enough who was responsible for Miss Rhoda's  conceit.  The tears dried on her face for very indignation, and she sat  upright in her seat, staring across the room.    It was a gorgeous apartment, this drawing-room of Erley Chase, the  residence of Henry Chester, Esquire, and Marianne his wife; a gorgeous  room in the literal acceptance of the term, for each separate article of  furniture looked as if it had been chosen more from the fact of its  intrinsic value than for its usefulness or beauty.    Mr Chester, the son of a country clergyman, had considered himself  passing rich when a manufacturer uncle took him into his employ, at a  salary of L400 a year.  The first thing he did after this position was  assured was to marry his old love, the daughter of the village doctor,  with whom he had played since childhood; and the young couple spent the  first dozen years of their married lives very happily and contentedly in  a little house in a smoky manufacturing town.  The bachelor uncle was  proud of his clever nephew and fond of the cheery little wife, who was  always kind and thoughtful even when gout and a naturally irritable  temper goaded him into conduct the reverse of amiable.  When Harold was  born, and christened after himself, he presented the child with a silver  mug, and remarked that he hoped he would turn out better than most young  men, and not break his parents' hearts as a return for their goodness.  When Jim followed, the mug was not forthcoming; but when little Rhoda  made her appearance six years later he gave her a rattle, and trusted  that she would improve in looks as she grew older, since he never  remembered seeing an uglier baby.  He was certainly neither a gracious  nor a liberal old gentleman, but the young couple were blessed with  contented minds and moderate ambitions, so they laughed good-naturedly  at his crusty speeches, and considered themselves rich, inasmuch as they  were able to pay their way and were spared anxiety for the future.  And  then an extraordinary thing happened!  The old man died suddenly, and  left to his beloved nephew a fortune which, even in these days of  millionaires, might truthfully be called enormous.  Henry Chester could  not believe the lawyers when the amount of his new wealth was broken to  him, for his uncle had lived so unostentatiously that he had had no idea  of the magnitude of his savings.  The little wife, who had never known  what it was to spend sixpence carelessly in all her thirty-five years,  grew quite hysterical with excitement when an arithmetical calculation  proved to her the daily riches at her disposal; but she recovered her  composure with wonderful celerity, and expressed her intention of  enjoying the goods which the gods had sent her.  No poking in gloomy  town houses after this!  No hoarding of riches as the poor old uncle had  done, while denying himself the common comforts of life!  She herself  had been economical from a sense of duty only, for her instincts were  all for lavishness and generosity--and now, now!  Did not Henry feel it  a provision of Providence that Erley Chase was empty, and, as it were,  waiting for their occupation?    Her husband gasped at the audacity of the idea.  Erley Chase! the finest  place around, one of the largest properties in the county, and Marianne  suggested that he should take it! that he should remove from his fifty-  pound house into that stately old pile!  The suggestion appalled him,  and yet why not?  His lawyer assured him that he could afford it; his  children were growing up, and he had their future to consider.  He  thought of his handsome boys, his curly-headed girl, and decided proudly  that nothing was too good for them; he looked into the future, and saw  his children's children reigning in his stead, and the name of Chester  honoured in the land.  So Erley Chase was bought, and little Mrs  Chester furnished it, as we have seen, to her own great contentment and  that of the tradespeople with whom she dealt; and in the course of a few  months the family moved into their new abode.    At first the country people were inclined to look coldly on the new-  comers, but it was impossible to keep up an unfriendly attitude towards  Mr and Mrs Chester.  They were utterly free from affectation, and, so  far from apeing that indifference to wealth adopted by most _nouveaux  riches_, were so frankly, transparently enchanted with their new  possessions that they were more like a couple of children with a new toy  than a steady-going, middle-aged couple.  They won first respect, and  then affection, and were felt to be a decided acquisition to the well-  being of the neighbourhood, since they were never appealed to in vain in  the cause of charity.    In the days of her own short means, when she had been obliged to look  helplessly at the trials of her neighbours, Mrs Chester had solaced  herself by dreaming of what she would do if she had money and to spare,  and to her credit be it said, she did not forget to put those dreams  into execution when the opportunity arose.  The days are past when fairy  godmothers flash suddenly before our raptured eyes, clad in spangled  robes, with real, true wings growing out of their shoulders, but the  race is not dead; they appear sometimes as stout little women, in satin  gowns and be-feathered bonnets, and with the most prosaic of red,  beaming faces.  The Chester barouche was not manufactured out of a  pumpkin, nor drawn by rats, but none the less had it spirited away many  a Cinderella to the longed-for ball, and, when the Prince was found, the  fairy godmother saw to it that there was no lack of satin gowns, or  glassy slippers.  Dick Whittingtons, too, sitting friendless by the  roadside, were helped on to fortune; and the Sleeping Beauty was rescued  from her dull little home, and taken about to see the world.  It is  wonderful what fairy deeds can be accomplished by a kind heart and a  full purse, and the recipients of Mrs Chester's bounty were relieved  from undue weight of obligation by the transparent evidence that her  enjoyment was even greater than their own!    Harold went to Eton and Oxford, and Jim to Sandhurst; but Rhoda stayed  at home and ruled supreme over her mother, her governesses, and the  servants of the establishment.  Her great-uncle's wish had been  fulfilled, inasmuch as she grew up tall and straight, with a mane of  reddish-gold hair and more than an average share of good looks.  She was  clever, too, and generous enough to have acknowledged her faults if it  had for one moment occurred to her that she possessed any; which it had  not.  It was one of Mrs Chester's articles of faith that her daughter  was the most beautiful, the most gifted, and the most perfect of created  beings, and Rhoda agreeably acquiesced in the decision, and was pitiful  of other girls who were not as herself.  Every morning when she had not  a headache, and did not feel \"floppy\" or \"nervey,\" she did lessons with  Fraulein, who adored her, and shed tears behind her spectacles when  obliged to point out a fault.  Then the two would repair together to the  tennis courts and play a set, the pupil winning by six games to love; or  go a bicycle ride, when Rhoda would practise fancy figures, while her  good, but cumbersome, companion picked herself up from recumbent  positions on the sidewalk, and shook the dust from her garments.

Two short chapters, one describing the life of an Ant-lion, and the  other the habits of a tame Toad, were added to the second edition, which  was in other respects a reproduction of the first.    The present edition has been improved by the adoption of a number of  illustrations which were designed for the German translation of this  book.        [Illustration]          INTRODUCTION.      I have often wished I could convey to others a little of the happiness I  have enjoyed all through my life in the study of Natural History. During  twenty years of variable health, the companionship of the animal world  has been my constant solace and delight. To keep my own memory fresh, in  the first instance, and afterwards with a distinct intention of  repeating my single experiences to others, I have kept notes of whatever  has seemed to me worthy of record in the life of my pets. Some of these  papers have already appeared in _The Animal World_; the majority are  now printed for the first time.    In the following chapters I shall try to have quiet talks with my  readers and tell them in a simple way about the many pleasant  friendships I have had with animals, birds, and insects. I use the word  friendships advisedly, because truly to know and enjoy the society of a  pet creature you must make it feel that you are, or wish to be, its  friend, one to whom it can always look for food, shelter, and solace; it  must be at ease and at home with you before its instincts and curious  ways will be shown. Sometimes when friends have wished me to see their  so-called \"pet,\" some scared animal or poor fluttering bird has been  brought, for whom my deepest sympathy has been excited; and yet there  may have been perhaps the kindest desire to make the creature happy,  food provided in abundance, and a pleasant home; but these alone will  not avail. For lack of the quiet gentle treatment which is so requisite,  the poor little captive will possibly be miserable, pining for liberty,  hating its prison, dreading the visits of its jailor, and so harassed in  its terror that in some cases the poor little heart is broken, and in a  few hours death is the result. In the following simple sketches of  animal, bird, and insect life, I have tried to show how confidence must  be gained, and the little wild heart won by quiet and unvarying  kindness, and also by the endeavour to imitate as much as possible the  natural surroundings of its own life before its capture. I must confess  it requires a large fund of patience to tame any wild creature, and it  is rarely possible to succeed unless one's efforts begin in its very  early days, before it has known the sweets of liberty.    In many cases I have kept a wild animal or bird for a few days to learn  something of its ways, possibly to make a drawing of its attitudes or  plumage, and then let it go, else nearly all my pets, except imported  creatures, have been reared from infancy, an invalid's life and  wakefulness making early-morning feeding of young fledglings less  difficult than it would have been in many cases, and often have painful  hours been made bearable and pleasant by the interest arising from  careful observation of the habits and ways of some new pet animal or  bird.    I have always strongly maintained that the love of animated nature  should be fostered far more than it usually is, and especially in the  minds of the young; and that, in fact, we lose an immense amount of  enjoyment by passing through life as so many do without a spark of  interest in the marvellous world of nature, that book whose pages are  ever lying open before us.    The beauties of the country might as well have been left uncreated for  all the interest that thousands take in them. Not only town dwellers,  who might be excused for their ignorance, but those who live in the  midst of fields and woods, often know so little about the curious  creatures in fur and feathers that exist around them that they are  surprised when told the simplest facts about these, their near  neighbours.    One reason may be, that it is now so much the fashion to spend the year  in various places, and those always moving about have neither the time  nor opportunity to cultivate the little undergrowths of quiet pleasures  which spring out of a settled home in the country, with its well-tended  garden and farmyard, greenhouses, stable, and fields--the horses and  cattle, petted and kindly cared for from their birth, dogs and poultry,  and all kinds of special favourites.    There is a healthy, happy tone about such a life, and where it exists  and is rightly maintained, good influence is, or ought to be, felt in  and around the home. Almost all children have a natural love of living  creatures, and if they are told interesting facts about them they soon  become ardent naturalists. I well remember that in my childhood I had a  great dread of toads and frogs, and a relative, to whom I owe much for  having directed my mind into the love of animated nature, took up a frog  in her hand and made me look at the beautiful gold circle round its  eyes, its curious webbed feet, its leaping power arising from the long  hind legs; she told me also of its wonderful tongue, so long and  flexible that it folded back in its mouth, and that the frog would sit  at the edge of an ant-hill and throwing out the tongue with its sticky  point, would pick off the ants one by one as they came out. When I  learnt all this, I began to watch such a curious reptile; my fears  vanished, and like Kingsley's little daughter, who had been wisely led  to care for all living things and came running to show her father a  \"dear delightful worm\" she had found! so I, too, have been led all  through my life to regard every created thing, great or small,  attractive or otherwise, as an object well worth the most reverent  study.    Perhaps I ought to explain that I have described methods of taming,  feeding, and housing one's pets with extreme minuteness in order to help  those of my readers who may be very fond of live creatures, and yet from  lack of opportunity may have gained no knowledge of their mode of life,  and what is required to keep them happily in health and vigour. I have  had to learn by experience that attention to very small details is the  road to success in keeping pets as well as in other things, and the  desire to pass on that experience must be my excuse to more scientific  readers for seeming triviality.    Many admirable books have been written by those well qualified to impart  their knowledge in every branch of"]]]
