NEAL.               *       *       *       *       *      To My Readers      It's no use; no use at all. The children won't let me stop telling tales  of the Land of Oz. I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tell  them, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won't allow  me. They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" and what can I do but  obey their commands?    This is Our Book--mine and the children's. For they have flooded me with  thousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly tried to  adopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story.    After the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothy  has become a firm fixture in these Oz stories. The little ones all love  Dorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn't a real  Oz story without her.\" So here she is again, as sweet and gentle and  innocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure.    There were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more about  the Wizard.\" It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the  first Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself  \"a humbug.\" The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a  balloon and they were all waiting for him to come down again. So what  could I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"? You will  find him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before.    There was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible to  do in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy's little  black dog, who has many friends among my readers. But you will see, when  you begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy was  in California, and so she had to start on her adventure without him. In  this book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog;  but in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write one, I intend to  tell a good deal about Toto's further history.    Princess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again introduced  in this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz. You will  also become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny Piglets,  and Eureka, the Kitten. I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved as  she ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn't brought up properly.  Dorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody knows.    I believe, my dears, that I am the proudest story-teller that ever  lived. Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while I  read the tender, loving, appealing letters that come to me in almost  every mail from my little readers. To have pleased you, to have  interested you, to have won your friendship, and perhaps your love,  through my stories, is to my mind as great an achievement as to become  President of the United States. Indeed, I would much rather be your  story-teller, under these conditions, than to be the President. So you  have helped me to fulfill my life's ambition, and I am more grateful to  you, my dears, than I can express in words.    I try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimes  there are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get  your answer. But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come,  and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of  preparing these books. Besides, I am proud to acknowledge that the books  are partly yours, for your suggestions often guide me in telling the  stories, and I am sure they would not be half so good without your  clever and thoughtful assistance.

THE EARTHQUAKE      The train from 'Frisco was very late. It should have arrived at Hugson's  siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the gray dawn  was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the  open shed that served for the station-house. As it came to a stop the  conductor called out in a loud voice:    \"Hugson's Siding!\"    At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the  car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage  covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked  under her arm. The conductor helped her off the car and then the  engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and  moved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was because  all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and  trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the  rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers. So he  moved the cars slowly and with caution.    The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared  around a curve; then she turned to see where she was.    The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and  did not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray light  not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person  in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy  standing near a group of trees a short distance away. She walked toward  it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its  head hanging down almost to the ground. It was a big horse, tall and  bony, with long legs and large knees and feet. She could count his ribs  easily where they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was  long and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit. His  tail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been broken in many  places and fastened together again with cords and bits of wire. The  buggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains.  Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw a  boy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.    She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. Presently  he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly.    \"Hello!\" he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"    \"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking  gray eyes. \"Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?\"    \"Of course,\" he answered. \"Train in?\"    \"I couldn't be here if it wasn't,\" she said.    He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping out of  the buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage on  the floor in front.    \"Canary-birds?\" he asked.    \"Oh, no; it's just Eureka, my kitten. I thought that was the best way to  carry her.\"    The boy nodded.    \"Eureka's a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked.    \"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained. \"Uncle Henry  says 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'\"    \"All right; hop in.\"    She climbed into the buggy and he followed her. Then the boy picked up  the reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\"    The horse did not stir. Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his  drooping ears, but that was all.    \"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again.    The horse stood still.    \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go.\"    The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.    \"Guess I'm half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse. \"But Jim knows  his business all right--don't you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of the  animal.    Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at  once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot  down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.    \"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy. \"I've waited"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22567"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 2 (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Notes]    The debt of England caused by the French and Indian War of 140,000,000  Pounds sterling is equivalent to about 19,000,000,000 Pounds in 2006.
