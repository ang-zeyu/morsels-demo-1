Macaulay          NOTE    HERODOTUS was born at Halicarnassus, on the southwest coast of Asia  Minor, in the early part of the fifth century, B. C. Of his life we know  almost nothing, except that he spent much of it traveling, to collect  the material for his writings, and that he finally settled down at  Thurii, in southern Italy, where his great work was composed. He died in  424 B. C.    The subject of the history of Herodotus is the struggle between the  Greeks and the barbarians, which he brings down to the battle of Mycale  in 479 B. C. The work, as we have it, is divided into nine books,  named after the nine Muses, but this division is probably due to the  Alexandrine grammarians. His information he gathered mainly from oral  sources, as he traveled through Asia Minor, down into Egypt, round  the Black Sea, and into various parts of Greece and the neighboring  countries. The chronological narrative halts from time to time to give  opportunity for descriptions of the country, the people, and their  customs and previous history; and the political account is constantly  varied by rare tales and wonders.    Among these descriptions of countries the most fascinating to the  modern, as it was to the ancient, reader is his account of the marvels  of the land of Egypt. From the priests at Memphis, Heliopolis, and the  Egyptian Thebes he learned what he reports of the size of the country,  the wonders of the Nile, the ceremonies of their religion, the  sacredness of their animals. He tells also of the strange ways of the  crocodile and of that marvelous bird, the Phoenix; of dress and funerals  and embalming; of the eating of lotos and papyrus; of the pyramids and  the great labyrinth; of their kings and queens and courtesans.    Yet Herodotus is not a mere teller of strange tales. However credulous  he may appear to a modern judgment, he takes care to keep separate what  he knows by his own observation from what he has merely inferred and  from what he has been told. He is candid about acknowledging ignorance,  and when versions differ he gives both. Thus the modern scientific  historian, with other means of corroboration, can sometimes learn from  Herodotus more than Herodotus himself knew.    There is abundant evidence, too, that Herodotus had a philosophy of  history. The unity which marks his work is due not only to the strong  Greek national feeling running through it, the feeling that rises to a  height in such passages as the descriptions of the battles of Marathon,  Thermopylae, and Salamis, but also to his profound belief in Fate and  in Nemesis. To his belief in Fate is due the frequent quoting of oracles  and their fulfilment, the frequent references to things foreordained by  Providence. The working of Nemesis he finds in the disasters that befall  men and nations whose towering prosperity awakens the jealousy of the  gods. The final overthrow of the Persians, which forms his main theme,  is only one specially conspicuous example of the operation of this force  from which human life can never free itself.    But, above all, he is the father of story-tellers. \"Herodotus is such  simple and delightful reading,\" says Jevons; \"he is so unaffected and  entertaining, his story flows so naturally and with such ease that  we have a difficulty in bearing in mind that, over and above the hard  writing which goes to make easy reading there is a perpetual marvel in  the work of Herodotus. It is the first artistic work in prose that Greek  literature produced. This prose work, which for pure literary merit no  subsequent work has surpassed, than which later generations, after  using the pen for centuries, have produced no prose more easy or more  readable, this was the first of histories and of literary prose.\"            AN ACCOUNT OF EGYPT    BY HERODOTUS          BEING THE SECOND BOOK OF HIS HISTORIES CALLED EUTERPE      When Cyrus had brought his life to an end, Cambyses received the royal  power in succession, being the son of Cyrus and of Cassandane the  daughter of Pharnaspes, for whose death, which came about before his  own, Cyrus had made great mourning himself and also had proclaimed to  all those over whom he bore rule that they should make mourning for her:  Cambyses, I say, being the son of this woman and of Cyrus, regarded  the Ionians and Aiolians as slaves inherited from his father; and he  proceeded to march an army against Egypt, taking with him as helpers not  only other nations of which he was ruler, but also those of the Hellenes  over whom he had power besides.      Now the Egyptians, before the time when Psammetichos became king over  them, were wont to suppose that they had come into being first of all  men; but since the time when Psammetichos having become king desired to  know what men had come into being first, they suppose that the Phrygians  came into being before themselves, but they themselves before all other  men. Now Psammetichos, when he was not able by inquiry to find out any  means of knowing who had come into being first of all men, contrived a  device of the following kind:--Taking two newborn children belonging to  persons of the common sort he gave them to a shepherd to bring up at  the place where his flocks were, with a manner of bringing up such as  I shall say, charging him namely that no man should utter any word in  their presence, and that they should be placed by themselves in a room  where none might come, and at the proper time he should bring them  she-goats, and when he had satisfied them with milk he should do for  them whatever else was needed. These things Psammetichos did and gave  him this charge wishing to hear what word the children would let break  forth first after they had ceased from wailings without sense. And  accordingly it came to pass; for after a space of two years had gone by,  during which the shepherd went on acting so, at length, when he opened  the door and entered, both children fell before him in entreaty and  uttered the word _bekos_, stretching forth their hands. At first when  he heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word was often  repeated, as he visited them constantly and attended to them, at last  he declared the matter to his master, and at his command he brought the  children before his face. Then Psammetichos having himself also heard  it, began to inquire what nation of men named anything _bekos_, and  inquiring he found that the Phrygians had this name for bread. In this  manner and guided by an indication such as this, the Egyptians were  brought to allow that the Phrygians were a more ancient people than  themselves. That so it came to pass I heard from the priests of that  Hephaistos who dwells at Memphis; but the Hellenes relate, besides many  other idle tales, that Psammetichos cut out the tongues of certain women  and then caused the children to live with these women.    With regard then to the rearing of the children they related so much as  I have said: and I heard also other things at Memphis when I had speech  with the priests of Hephaistos. Moreover I visited both Thebes and  Heliopolis for this very cause, namely because I wished to know whether  the priests at these places would agree in their accounts with those at  Memphis; for the men of Heliopolis are said to be the most learned in  records of the Egyptians. Those of their narrations which I heard with  regard to the gods I am not earnest to relate in full, but I shall name  them only because I consider that all men are equally ignorant of these  matters: and whatever things of them I may record I shall record only  because I am compelled by the course of the story. But as to those  matters which concern men, the priests agreed with one another in saying  that the Egyptians were the first of all men on earth to find out the  course of the year, having divided the seasons into twelve parts to make  up the whole; and this they said they found out from the stars: and they  reckon to this extent more wisely than the Hellenes, as it seems to  me, inasmuch as the Hellenes throw in an intercalated month every other  year, to make the seasons right, whereas the Egyptians, reckoning the  twelve months at thirty days each, bring in also every year five days  beyond number, and thus the circle of their season is completed and  comes round to the same point whence it set out. They said moreover that  the Egyptians were the first who brought into use appellations for the  twelve gods and the Hellenes took up the use from them; and that they  were the first who assigned altars and images and temples to the gods,  and who engraved figures on stones; and with regard to the greater  number of these things they showed me by actual facts that they had  happened so. They said also that the first man who became king of Egypt  was Min; and that in his time all Egypt except the district of Thebes  was a swamp, and none of the regions were then above water which now lie  below the lake of Moiris, to which lake it is a voyage of seven days  up the river from the sea: and I thought that they said well about the  land; for it is manifest in truth even to a person who has not heard it  beforehand but has only seen, at least if he have understanding, that  the Egypt to which the Hellenes come in ships is a land which has been  won by the Egyptians as an addition, and that it is a gift of the river:  moreover the regions which lie above this lake also for a distance of  three days' sail, about which they did not go on to say anything of  this kind, are nevertheless another instance of the same thing: for the  nature of the land of Egypt is as follows:--First when you are still  approaching it in a ship and are distant a day's run from the land, if  you let down a sounding-line you will bring up mud and you will find  yourself in eleven fathoms. This then so far shows that there is a  silting forward of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#1)"],[1,"Severn's Schooldays, by George Manville Fenn.    ________________________________________________________________________    Glyn Severn and the Maharajah of Dour, both about 15 or 16, have been  sent together to an English Boarding School.  Glyn's father has been for  many years a Colonel in the Maharajah's father's army, but now the old  Maharajah is dead, and his son, known at school as \"Singh\", has  inherited the title.  The Colonel is Singh's guardian.    There are the usual schoolboyish rivalries and fights, in particular  involving a nasty individual called Slegge.  A menagerie owner lives  nearby, and among his animals is an elephant who is sometimes in a bad  mood.  It turns out that Glyn and Singh, who have had dealings with  elephants in India, are rather good at bringing it under control.    Singh has brought one of his Princely regalia, a heavily bejewelled  belt.  One day it disappears.  Several people are known to be short of  cash, so are suspected of the theft.  Nearly half the book is spent in  chasing out the culprit, but we get there in the end.    However, there is a surprise ending to the book.    It should be mentioned that the title is a little misleading, for  \"schooldays\" covers well over a decade, but the action in this book  covers only a few days.  NH    ________________________________________________________________________    GLYN SEVERN'S SCHOOLDAYS, BY GEORGE MANVILE FENN.        CHAPTER ONE.    THE NEW BOYS.    Slegge said it was all \"bosh;\" for fifty years ago a boy at school had  not learned to declare that everything which did not suit his taste was  \"rot.\"  So Slegge stood leaning up against the playground wall with a  supercilious sneer upon his lip, and said it was all \"bosh,\" and only  fit for children.    The other fellows, he said, might make idiots of themselves if they  liked, he should stop in and read; for Dr Bewley, DD, Principal of the  world-famed establishment--a grey, handsome, elderly gentleman in the  truest sense of the word--had smilingly said after grace at breakfast  that when he was a boy he used to take a great deal of interest in  natural history, and that he presumed his pupils would feel much the  same as he did, and would have no objection to setting aside their  classical and mathematical studies for the morning and watching the  entrance of the procession when it entered the town at twelve o'clock.    The boys, who were all standing and waiting for the Doctor to leave the  dining-hall, gave a hearty cheer at this; and as the ragged volley died  out, after being unduly prolonged by the younger pupils, instead of  crossing to the door from the table, the Doctor continued, turning to  the mathematical master:    \"I think, Mr Morris, you might be kind enough to tell Wrench to get the  boy to help him and place a line of forms by the wall, so that the young  gentlemen can enjoy the privilege of having a prolonged private box  above the crowd; or, shall I say, a high bank in this modern form of the  classic amphitheatre?\"    \"Hear, hear!\" said Mr Rampson, the heavy, solid-looking classical  master, impressed by the Principal's allusion to the Roman sports; and  he grumbled out something in a subdued voice, with his eyes shut.  What  it was the boys did not hear, but it was evidently a Latin quotation,  and ended in _ibus_.    The Doctor then marched slowly towards the door, with his black gown  floating out around him, and carrying his mortar-board cap by the limp  corner; for while everything about him was spick and span--his cravat of  the stiffest and whitest as it supported his plump, pink, well-shaven  chin, and his gown of the glossiest black--a habit of holding his  college cap by its right-hand corner had resulted in the formation of a  kind of hinge which made the University headpiece float up and down in  concert with his stately steps as he turned his head from side to side  and nodded benignantly at first one and then another of his junior  pupils.    The masters followed, looking very severe indeed; and, following the  example set by Mr Morris, they all frowned and shook their heads at the  great waste of time that would follow the passing of the procession.    \"So childish of the old man,\" said Morris to the French master, Monsieur  Brohanne, a particularly plump-looking Gaul.  \"The boys will be fit for  nothing afterwards.\"    \"_Certainement_!\" said the French master.    \"But I suppose I must give orders for these seats to be placed;\" and as  soon as he was outside he summoned Wrench--the pale-faced and red-nosed  official whose principal duty it was, with the assistance of a sturdy  hobbledehoy (Mounseer Hobby-de-Hoy, as the boys called him) to keep  well-blackened the whole of the boots in the big establishment--and gave  orders to carry out and run a line of forms all along the outer wall of  the great playground, which was continued farther on by the  cricket-field hedge.    \"A great waste of time,\" said Morris; but he gave very strict orders to  the man-servant that the biggest and strongest form was to be chalked  \"Number One,\" and reserved for the masters only.    There was a buzz in the dining-hall which grew into a roar as the door  closed.  The boys, who had sat down to breakfast rather wanting in  appetite--from the fact that their consciences were not very clear  regarding studies in English and French or certain algebraic solutions  or arrangements in angles specified by \"A B C\" and \"D E F,\" according to  the declarations of a well-known gentleman named Euclid--felt in their  great relief as if they would like another cup of coffee and two slices  more, for the holiday was quite unexpected.    It was about this time that Slegge gave his opinion to his following,  which was rather large, he being the senior pupil and considering  himself head-chief of the school, not from his distinguished position as  a scholar, but from the fact that his allowance of cash from home was  the largest of that furnished to any pupil of the establishment, without  counting extra tips.  Slegge, Senior--not the pupil, for there was no  other boy of the same name in the school, but Slegge _pere_, as Monsieur  Brohanne would have termed him--being sole proprietor of the great  wholesale mercantile firm of Slegge, Gorrock and Dredge, Italian  warehousemen, whose place of business was in the City of London, and  was, as Slegge insisted, \"not a shop.\"    \"You fellows,\" he said, \"can do as you like.  Some of you had better set  up a wicket and the net, and come and bowl to me.  Ha, ha! look at  Thames and the Nigger!  It will just suit them.  Those Indian chaps  think of nothing else but show.  I shan't be at all surprised if the  nigger goes up to dress and comes down again in white muslin and a  turban.--I say!  Hi!  Thames!  Rivers!  What's your stupid name?  It's  going to be a hot day.  You ought to come out with the chow-chow.\"    \"No, no,\" whispered a boy beside him, \"chowri.\"    \"Well, chow-chow, chowri; it's all the same,\" said the big lad  impatiently.  \"Horse-tail to whisk the flies away.--Hi! do you hear?\"    \"Are you speaking to me?\" said the tall, very English-looking lad  addressed.    \"Of course I am.\"    \"Well, you might address me by my name.\"    \"Well, so I did.  Thames.  No, I remember, Severn!  What idiots your  people were to give themselves names like that!\"    \"Well, it's as good as Slegge anyhow,\" said the lad.    There was a little laugh at this, which made the owner of the latter  name turn sharply and fiercely upon the nearest boy, who shut his mouth  instantly and looked as innocent as a lamb.    \"Look here,\" said Slegge, turning again to the lad he had addressed,  \"don't you be cheeky, sir, or you'll find yourself walked down behind  the tennis-court some morning to have a first breakfast; and you won't  be the first that I have taught his place in this school.\"    \"Oh,\" said the lad quietly, \"you mean fighting?\"    \"Yes,\" said Slegge, thrusting out his chin, \"I mean fighting.  You are  new to this place, and you have been coming the stuck-up on the strength  of your father being a poor half-pay Company's colonel.  Honourable East  India Company indeed!  Shabby set of sham soldiers got-up to look like  the real.\"    The face of the boy he addressed changed colour a little, and he drew a  deep breath as he compressed his lips.    \"And don't you look at me like that,\" continued Slegge, who was  delighted to find a large audience gathering round him to listen while  he gave one of the new boys a good setting down, \"or you may find that,  after I have done with you, you won't be fit to show your ugly  mug in the row of grinning boobies staring over the wall at a  twopenny-halfpenny wild-beast show.\"    \"I don't want to quarrel,\" said the lad quietly.    \"Oh, don't you!\" continued Slegge, with a sneering laugh.  \"Well,  perhaps I do, and if I do I shall just give your master one for himself  as well.\"    \"My master,\" said the lad staring.    \"Yes, your master, the nigger--Howdah, Squashee, or whatever he calls  himself.  Here! hi! you, Aziz Singh-Song, or whatever your name is, why  don't you dress up and go and get leave from the Doctor to ride the  elephant in the procession?  Your father is a mahout out there in India,  isn't he?\"    The boy he addressed, who had just come up to lay his hand upon the  shoulder of Severn, to whisper, \"What's the matter, Glyn?\" started on  hearing this address, and his dark face, which was about the tint of a  _young_ Spaniard's, whom he resembled greatly in mien, flushed up and  the lips closed very tightly, but only to part again and show his  glistening white teeth.  \"My father--\" he began.    \"Bother! come on,\" cried Severn, putting his arm round the other and  half-pushing, half-dragging him through the crowd of lads who were  clustering round in expectation of a coming set-to.    There was a low murmur as of disgust as the two lads elbowed their way  through, whilst Slegge"]]]
