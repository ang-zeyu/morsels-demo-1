ADVERTISEMENT.      The writer of these pages ought, perhaps, to apologize for attempting a  work on a subject, of which he is not a _professional_ master, either in  design or execution. In the science of Farm buildings he claims no  better knowledge than a long practical observation has given him. The  thoughts herein submitted for the consideration of those interested in  the subject of Farm buildings are the result of that observation, added  to his experience in the use of such buildings, and a conviction of the  inconveniences attending many of those already planned and erected.    Nor is it intended, in the production of this work, to interfere with  the labors of the professional builder. To such builder all who may be  disposed to adopt any model or suggestion here presented, are referred,  for the various details, in their specifications, and estimates, that  may be required; presuming that the designs and descriptions of this  work will be sufficient for the guidance of any master builder, in their  erection and completion.    But for the solicitation of those who believe that the undersigned could  offer some improvements in the construction of Farm buildings for the  benefit of our landholders and practical farmers, these pages would  probably never have appeared. They are offered in the hope that they may  be useful in assisting to form the taste, and add to the comfort of  those who are the main instruments in embellishing the face of our  country in its most pleasing and agreeable features--the American  Farmer.

Otis & Brown,  architects, of Buffalo, to whose skill and experience he takes a  pleasure in recommending such as may wish instruction in the plans,  drawings, specifications, or estimates relating to either of the designs  here submitted, or for others of any kind that may be adapted to their  purposes.

This letter of ours corresponds to the first symbol in  the Phoenician alphabet and in almost all its descendants.  In  Phoenician, a, like the symbols for e and for o, did not  represent a vowel, but a breathing; the vowels originally were  not represented by any symbol.  When the alphabet was adopted by  the Greeks it was not very well fitted to represent the sounds  of their language.  The breathings which were not required in  Greek were accordingly employed to represent some of the vowel  sounds, other vowels, like i and u, being represented by  an adaptation of the symbols for the semi-vowels y and w.  The Phoenician name, which must have corresponded closely to  the Hebrew Aleph, was taken over by the Greeks in the form  Alpha (alpsa). The earliest authority for this, as for the  names of the other Greek letters, is the grammatical drama  (grammatike Ieoria) of Callias, an earlier contemporary of  Euripides, from whose works four trimeters, containing the names  of all the Greek letters, are preserved in Athenaeus x. 453 d.    The form of the letter has varied considerably.  In the  earliest of the Phoenician, Aramaic and Greek inscriptions  (the oldest Phoenician dating about 1000 B.C., the oldest  Aramaic from the 8th, and the oldest Greek from the 8th  or 7th century B.C.) A rests upon its side thus--@.  In  the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles  the modern capital letter, but many local varieties can be  distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle  at which the cross line is set-- @, &c. From the Greeks of  the west the alphabet was borrowed by the Romans and from them  has passed to the other nations of western Europe.  In the  earliest Latin inscriptions, such as the inscription found  in the excavation of the Roman Forum in 1899, or that on a  golden fibula found at Praeneste in 1886 (see ALPHABET).  Fine letters are still identical in form with those of the  western Greeks.  Latin develops early various forms, which  are comparatively rare in Greek, as @, or unknown, as  @.  Except possibly Faliscan, the other dialects of Italy  did not borrow their alphabet directly from the western Greeks  as the Romans did, but received it at second hand through the  Etruscans.  In Oscan, where the writing of early inscriptions  is no less careful than in Latin, the A takes the form  @, to which the nearest parallels are found in north Greece  (Boeotia, Locris and Thessaly, and there only sporadically) .    In Greek the symbol was used for both the long and the short  sound, as in English father (a) and German Ratte  a; English, except in dialects, has no sound corresponding  precisely to the Greek short a, which, so far as can be  ascertained, was a mid-back-wide sound, according to the  terminology of H. Sweet (Primer of Phonetics, p. 107).  Throughout the history of Greek the short sound remained practically  unchanged.  On the other hand, the long sound of a in the  Attic and Ionic dialects passed into an open e-sound, which  in the Ionic alphabet was represented by the same symbol as  the original e-sound (see ALPHABET: Greek). The vowel  sounds vary from language to language, and the a symbol has,  in consequence, to represent in many cases sounds which are  not identical with the Greek a whether long or short, and  also to represent several different vowel sounds in the same  language.  Thus the New English Dictionary distinguishes about  twelve separate vowel sounds, which are represented by a in  English.  In general it may be said that the chief changes  which affect the a-sound in different languages arise from  (1) rounding, (2) fronting, i.e. changing from a sound  produced far back in the mouth to a sound produced farther  forward.  The rounding is often produced by combination with  rounded consonants (as in English was, wall, &c.), the  rounding of the preceding consonant being continued into  the formation of the vowel sound.  Rounding has also been  produced by a following l-sound, as in the English fall,  small, bald, &c. (see Sweet's History of English Sounds,  2nd ed., sec. sec.  906, 784).  The effect of fronting is seen in  the Ionic and Attic dialects of Greek, where the original  name of the Medes, Madoi, with a in the first syllable  (which survives in Cyprian Greek as Madoi), is changed  into Medoi (Medoi), with an open e-sound instead  of the earlier a.  In the later history of Greek this  sound is steadily narrowed till it becomes identical with  i (as in English seed). The first part of the process  has been almost repeated by literary English, a (ah)  passing into e (eh), though in present-day pronunciation  the sound has developed further into a diphthongal ei  except before r, as in hare (Sweet, op. cit. sec.  783).    In English a represents unaccented forms of several  words, e.g. an (one), of, have, he, and or various  prefixes the history of which is given in detail in the New  English Dictionary (Oxford, 1888), vol. i. p. 4. (P. GI.)    As a symbol the letter is used in various connexions  and for various technical purposes, e.g. for a note in  music, for the first of the seven dominical letters (this  use is derived from its being the first of the litterae  nundinales at Rome), and generally as a sign of priority.    In Logic, the letter A is used as a symbol for the universal  affirmative proposition in the general form ``all x is y.''  The letters I, E and O are used respectively for the particular  affirmative ``some x is y,'' the universal negative ``no x  is y,'' and the particular negative ``some x is not y.''  The use of these letters is generally derived from the vowels  of the two Latin verbs AffIrmo (or AIo), ``I assert,'' and  nEgO, ``I deny.'' The use of the symbols dates from the 13th  century, though some authorities trace their origin to the Greek  logicians.  A is also used largely in abbreviations (q.v.).    In Shipping, A1 is a symbol used to dennote quality of  construction and material.  In the various shipping registers  ships are classed and given a rating after an official  examination, and assigned a classification mark, which  appears in addition to other particulars in those registers  after the name of the ship.  See SHIPBUILDING. It is  popularly used to indicate the highest degree of excellence.    AA, the name of a large number of small European rivers.  The word is derived from the Old German aha, cognate to  the Latin aqua, water (cf. Ger.-ach; Scand. a, aa,  pronounced o).  The following are the more important  streams of this name:--Two rivers in the west of Russia, both  falling into the Gulf of Riga, near Riga, which is situated  between them; a river in the north of France, falling into  the sea below Gravelines, and navigable as far as St Omer;  and a river of Switzerland, in the cantons of Lucerne and  Aargau, which carries the waters of Lakes Baldegger and  Hallwiler into the Aar. In Germany there are the Westphalian  Aa, rising in the Teutoburger Wald, and joining the Werre at  Herford, the Munster Aa, a tributary of the Ems, and others.    AAGESEN, ANDREW (1826-1879), Danish jurist, was educated  for the law at Kristianshavn and Copenhagen, and interrupted  his studies in 1848 to take part in the first Schleswig war,  in which he served as the leader of a reserve battalion.  In  1855 he became professor of jurisprudence at the university of  Copenhagen.  In 1870 he was appointed a member of the commission  for drawing up a maritime and commercial code, and the navigation  law of 1882 is mainly his work.  In 1879 he was elected a member  of the Landsthing; but it is as a teacher at the university  that he won his reputation.  Among his numerous juridical  works may be mentioned: Bidrag til Laeren om Overdragelse  af Ejendomsret, Bemaerkinger om Rettigheder over Ting  (Copenhagen, 1866, 1871-1872); Fortegnelse over Retssamlinger,  Retslitteratur i Danmark, Norge, Sverige (Copenhagen,  1876).  Aagesen was Hall's successor as lecturer on Roman law  at the university, and in this department his researches were  epoch-making.  All his pupils were profoundly impressed by  his exhaustive examination of the sources, his energetic  demonstration of his subject and his stringent search after  truth.  His noble, imposing, and yet most amiable personality  won for him, moreover, universal affection and respect.    See C. F. Bricka, Dansk.  Brog.  Lex. vol. i. (Copenhagen, 1887); Szmlade  Skrifter, edited by F. C. Bornemann (Copenhagen, 1863). (R. N. B.)    AAL, also known as A'L, ACH, or AICH, the Hindustani  names for the Morinda tinctoria and Morinda citrifalia,  plants extensively cultivated in India on account of the  reddish dye-stuff which their roots contain.
