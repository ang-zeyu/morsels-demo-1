The Norman bays which they replaced were  injured by the fall of the central Tower in 1322. The six eastern bays  (the Presbytery) are in the Early English Style, and were built by  Bishop Northwold (1235-1252).    Having entered the South aisle of the Choir by the iron gate marked 1  on the plan, and passed, on the right, the monuments of Bishop Allen,  and the Stewards, we come to 2. Bishop de Luda's monument (1298)  restored on the north side by Dean Peacock. 3. Bishop Barnet's tomb  (1373). 4. Tomb of John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, and his two wives  (1470). 5. Tomb of Bishop Hotham (1337) who left money for the  rebuilding of the three Decorated bays of the Choir. 6. On the south  side of the aisle is the monument erected in 1879 to Canon Selwyn. 7.  Bishop West's Chapel, built about 1534, containing the graves of  Bishops West, Keene, and Sparke, and on the south side the remains of  seven benefactors of the monastery removed from the Conventual Church  in 1154; and built in the north wall is the tomb of Cardinal de  Luxemburg, Bishop of Ely, who died 1443. 8. In the Retro-Choir is the  tomb of Dr. Mill, Canon of Ely, and Regius Professor of Hebrew at  Cambridge, who died in 1853. 9. Grave of Bishop and Mrs. Allen (1845).  10. The east wall on which are traces of painting of which no account  can be given. 11. Bishop Alcock's Chapel, containing his grave; he  died in 1500; he was founder of Jesus College, Cambridge. 12. Tomb of  Bishop Northwold, founder of the Presbytery, who was Abbot of Bury  before he became Bishop of Ely; died in 1254. 13. The monument  formerly placed over Bishop Hotham's tomb, but supposed to be part of  the shrine of St. Etheldreda as adapted by Alan de Walsingham. 14.  Tomb of Bishop Kilkenny (1250). 15. Tomb of Bishop Redman (1505). 16.  The Reredos, designed by Sir G.G. Scott, presented by John Dunn  Gardner, Esq., in memory of his wife (1851). 17. The spiral Staircase  leading to the organ loft: the organ was built by Hill and Son, of  London. 18 and 19. The Stalls--very ancient, though the carved panels  above them are modern; the north side represents a series of pictures  from the New Testament; on the south side are illustrations of the Old  Testament; they were carved by Abeloos of Louvain. The sub-stalls are  new. 20. The oaken Screen designed by Sir G.G. Scott.    For further particulars see \"Hand-Book to the Cathedral,\" published by  Messrs.

[Illustration: ST. ETHELDREDA.]          +Advertisement+    TO THE ELEVENTH EDITION.      When this Work first appeared as a candidate for public favour in  1852, the Compiler had but faint hopes of its ever attaining a  position of usefulness which the sale of the several editions has  proved it to have done. His constant aim has been to render it a  faithful as well as a convenient and useful companion to strangers and  others when examining this interesting Cathedral; and, in order to  render each succeeding edition more complete, his study has been to  give from time to time the best information in his power upon the  improvements which have for many years been in progress. He tenders  his best thanks for the kindness of many friends who have afforded him  information, and has availed himself of the important remarks of the  late Sir G.G. Scott at the Etheldreda Festival in 1873, and of the  valuable work of Mr. Stewart to correct as well as to verify and  support his own statements, for which his grateful acknowledgments are  due. The whole has been revised, and some additions have been made,  which he is induced to hope will enhance its value, and render it more  worthy of public favor.    _April, 1880._          +Advertisement+    TO THE FIRST EDITION.      This Hand-book is intended simply as a \"guide\" for those who visit Ely  for the purpose of seeing the Cathedral, the remains of the ancient  Monastery, and other objects of similar interest.    The Compiler acknowledges himself greatly indebted for much valuable  information to the elaborate works of Mr. Bentham and Mr. Millers;  and, although he is conscious that his task has been performed but  imperfectly, he still ventures to hope that, in the absence of the  larger works above referred to, his little compilation will prove both  interesting and useful.    _May, 1852._    [Illustration]          CONTENTS.

[Illustration]          +Introduction.+      The introductory chapter of a book is often passed over without the  careful perusal it very frequently deserves, when, perhaps, its  purpose is to promote a better understanding of the subject contained  in the main portion of the work. In the present instance our object is  to give our readers an outline--a very brief one it is true--of the  history and foundation of the monastery at Ely twelve centuries ago,  which led to the subsequent erection of one of the noblest Cathedrals  in the kingdom, in order to enable them to understand more fully some  of the remarks in our description of this grand edifice as we now see  it. To those who desire a more elaborate detail or fuller description  than we can offer in our limited space, we would recommend a reference  to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20925"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 1 (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Notes]    The appearance of the Word format closely approximates the original  text, except that sentence fragments are rejoined across page and  illustration boundaries.

HISTORY OF  THE UNITED STATES  FROM THE EARLIEST DISCOVERY OF  AMERICA TO THE PRESENT TIME      BY  E. BENJAMIN ANDREWS  CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA  FORMERLY PRESIDENT OF BROWN UNIVERSITY      With 650 Illustrations and Maps      VOLUME I.      NEW YORK  CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS  1912      COPYRIGHT, 1894, BY  CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS    [Illustration: Scribner logo.]        TO MY WIFE        PREFACE    Notwithstanding the number of United States histories already in  existence, and the excellence of many of them, I venture to think that  no apology is needed for bringing forward another.    1. The work now presented to the public is believed to utilize, more  than any of its predecessors, the many valuable researches of recent  years into the rich archives of this and other nations.    2. Most of the briefer treatments of the subject are manuals, intended  for pupils in schools, the conspicuous articulation so necessary for  this purpose greatly lessening their interest for the general reader.  The following narrative will be found continuous as well as of moderate  compass.    3. I have sought to make more prominent than popular histories have  usually done, at the same time the political evolution of our country on  the one hand, and the social culture, habits, and life of the people on  the other.    4. The work strives to observe scrupulous proportion in treating the  different parts and phases of our national career, neglecting none and  over-emphasizing none. Also, while pronouncedly national and patriotic,  it is careful to be perfectly fair and kind to the people of all  sections.    5. Effort has been made to present the matter in the most natural  periods and divisions, and to give such a title to each of these as to  render the table of contents a truthful and instructive epitome of our  national past.    6. With the same aim the Fore-history is exhibited in sharp separation  from the United States history proper, calling due attention to what is  too commonly missed, the truly epochal character of the adoption of our  present Constitution, in 1789.    7. Copious illustration has been employed, with diligent study to make  it for every reader in the highest degree an instrument of instruction,  delight, and cultivation in art.    8. No pains has been spared to secure perfect accuracy in all references  to dates, persons, and places, so that the volumes may be used with  confidence as a work of reference. I am persuaded that much success in  this has been attained, despite the uncertainty still attaching to many  matters of this sort in United States history, especially to dates.    BROWN UNIVERSITY, September 15. 1894.        PUBLISHERS' NOTE    The last edition of President Andrews's History was issued in 1905, in  five volumes, and brought the narrative down to the inauguration of  President Roosevelt in March of that year. In preparing the extension of  the work by the addition of a sixth volume, entrusted to the competent  hands of Professor James Alton James of Northwestern University, it has  been thought desirable to begin this final volume with the chapters  entitled \"The Rise of Roosevelt\" and \"Mr. Roosevelt's Presidency.\" This  has involved some expansion and revision of these chapters as well as  the continuance of the History from 1905 to the present time. The  Appendices, which include public documents of fundamental importance and  the significant results in various fields of the Census of 1910, are an  additional feature of the new edition.
