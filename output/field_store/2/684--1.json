The motives of any persons to pursue such a       profession must be different from those of trade, deeper       than pride, and stronger than interest.                                         GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE.      Among the men and women prominent in the public life of America there  are but few whose names are mentioned as often as that of Emma  Goldman.  Yet the real Emma Goldman is almost quite unknown.  The  sensational press has surrounded her name with so much  misrepresentation and slander, it would seem almost a miracle that,  in spite of this web of calumny, the truth breaks through and a  better appreciation of this much maligned idealist begins to manifest  itself.  There is but little consolation in the fact that almost  every representative of a new idea has had to struggle and suffer  under similar difficulties.  Is it of any avail that a former  president of a republic pays homage at Osawatomie to the memory of  John Brown?  Or that the president of another republic participates  in the unveiling of a statue in honor of Pierre Proudhon, and holds  up his life to the French nation as a model worthy of enthusiastic  emulation?  Of what avail is all this when, at the same time, the  LIVING John Browns and Proudhons are being crucified?  The honor and  glory of a Mary Wollstonecraft or of a Louise Michel are not enhanced  by the City Fathers of London or Paris naming a street after  them--the living generation should be concerned with doing justice to  the LIVING Mary Wollstonecrafts and Louise Michels.  Posterity  assigns to men like Wendel Phillips and Lloyd Garrison the proper  niche of honor in the temple of human emancipation; but it is the  duty of their contemporaries to bring them due recognition and  appreciation while they live.    The path of the propagandist of social justice is strewn with thorns.  The powers of darkness and injustice exert all their might lest a ray  of sunshine enter his cheerless life.  Nay, even his comrades in the  struggle--indeed, too often his most intimate friends--show but  little understanding for the personality of the pioneer.  Envy,  sometimes growing to hatred, vanity and jealousy, obstruct his way  and fill his heart with sadness.  It requires an inflexible will and  tremendous enthusiasm not to lose, under such conditions, all faith  in the Cause.  The representative of a revolutionizing idea stands  between two fires: on the one hand, the persecution of the existing  powers which hold him responsible for all acts resulting from social  conditions; and, on the other, the lack of understanding on the part  of his own followers who often judge all his activity from a narrow  standpoint.  Thus it happens that the agitator stands quite alone in  the midst of the multitude surrounding him.  Even his most intimate  friends rarely understand how solitary and deserted he feels.  That  is the tragedy of the person prominent in the public eye.    The mist in which the name of Emma Goldman has so long been enveloped  is gradually beginning to dissipate.  Her energy in the furtherance  of such an unpopular idea as Anarchism, her deep earnestness, her  courage and abilities, find growing understanding and admiration.    The debt American intellectual growth owes to the revolutionary  exiles has never been fully appreciated.  The seed disseminated by  them, though so little understood at the time, has brought a rich  harvest.  They have at all times held aloft the banner of liberty,  thus impregnating the social vitality of the Nation.  But very few  have succeeding in preserving their European education and culture  while at the same time assimilating themselves with American life.  It is difficult for the average man to form an adequate conception  what strength, energy, and perseverance are necessary to absorb the  unfamiliar language, habits, and customs of a new country, without  the loss of one's own personality.    Emma Goldman is one of the few who, while thoroughly preserving their  individuality, have become an important factor in the social and  intellectual atmosphere of America.  The life she leads is rich in  color, full of change and variety.  She has risen to the topmost  heights, and she has also tasted the bitter dregs of life.    Emma Goldman was born of Jewish parentage on the 27th day of June,  1869, in the Russian province of Kovno.  Surely these parents never  dreamed what unique position their child would some day occupy.  Like  all conservative parents they, too, were quite convinced that their  daughter would marry a respectable citizen, bear him children, and  round out her allotted years surrounded by a flock of grandchildren,  a good, religious woman.  As most parents, they had no inkling what a  strange, impassioned spirit would take hold of the soul of their  child, and carry it to the heights which separate generations in  eternal struggle.  They lived in a land and at a time when antagonism  between parent and offspring was fated to find its most acute  expression, irreconcilable hostility.  In this tremendous struggle  between fathers and sons--and especially between parents and  daughters--there was no compromise, no weak yielding, no truce.  The  spirit of liberty, of progress--an idealism which knew no  considerations and recognized no obstacles--drove the young  generation out of the parental house and away from the hearth of the  home.  Just as this same spirit once drove out the revolutionary  breeder of discontent, Jesus, and alienated him from his native  traditions.    What role the Jewish race--notwithstanding all anti-semitic calumnies  the race of transcendental idealism--played in the struggle of the  Old and the New will probably never be appreciated with complete  impartiality and clarity.  Only now are we beginning to perceive the  tremendous debt we owe to Jewish idealists in the realm of science,  art, and literature.  But very little is still known of the important  part the sons and daughters of Israel have played in the  revolutionary movement and, especially, in that of modern times.    The first years of her childhood Emma Goldman passed in a small,  idyllic place in the German-Russian province of Kurland, where her  father had charge of the government stage.  At the time Kurland was  thoroughly German; even the Russian bureaucracy of that Baltic  province was recruited mostly from German JUNKERS.  German fairy  tales and stories, rich in the miraculous deeds of the heroic knights  of Kurland, wove their spell over the youthful mind.  But the  beautiful idyl was of short duration.  Soon the soul of the growing  child was overcast by the dark shadows of life.  Already in her  tenderest youth the seeds of rebellion and unrelenting hatred of  oppression were to be planted in the heart of Emma Goldman.  Early  she learned to know the beauty of the State: she saw her father  harassed by the Christian CHINOVNIKS and doubly persecuted as petty  official and hated Jew.  The brutality of forced conscription ever  stood before her eyes: she beheld the young men, often the sole  supporter of a large family, brutally dragged to the barracks to lead  the miserable life of a soldier.  She heard the weeping of the poor  peasant women, and witnessed the shameful scenes of official venality  which relieved the rich from military service at the expense of the  poor.  She was outraged by the terrible treatment to which the female  servants were subjected: maltreated and exploited by their BARINYAS,  they fell to the tender mercies of the regimental officers, who  regarded them as their natural sexual prey.  The girls, made pregnant  by respectable gentlemen and driven out by their mistresses, often  found refuge in the Goldman home.  And the little girl, her heart  palpitating with sympathy, would abstract coins from the parental  drawer to clandestinely press the money into the hands of the  unfortunate women.  Thus Emma Goldman's most striking characteristic,  her sympathy with the underdog, already became manifest in these  early years.    At the age of seven little Emma was sent by her parents to her  grandmother at Konigsberg, the city of Emanuel Kant, in Eastern  Prussia.  Save for occasional interruptions, she remained there till her  13th birthday.  The first years in these surroundings do not exactly  belong to her happiest recollections.  The grandmother, indeed, was  very amiable, but the numerous aunts of the household were concerned  more with the spirit of practical rather than pure reason, and the  categoric imperative was applied all too frequently.  The situation  was changed when her parents migrated to Konigsberg, and little Emma  was relieved from her role of Cinderella.  She now regularly attended  public school and also enjoyed the advantages of private instruction,  customary in middle class life; French and music lessons played an  important part in the curriculum.  The future interpreter of Ibsen  and Shaw was then a little German Gretchen, quite at home in the  German atmosphere.  Her special predilections in literature were the  sentimental romances of Marlitt; she was a great admirer of the good  Queen Louise,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#1)"],[1,"IN    THE MIDDLE AGES    BY    F.

Somner Merryweather,  _with an Introduction by_ Charles Orr, _Librarian of Case Library._          INTRODUCTION.      In every century for more than two thousand years, many men have owed  their chief enjoyment of life to books. The bibliomaniac of today had his  prototype in ancient Rome, where book collecting was fashionable as early  as the first century of the Christian era. Four centuries earlier there  was an active trade in books at Athens, then the center of the book  production of the world. This center of literary activity shifted to  Alexandria during the third century B. C. through the patronage of  Ptolemy Soter, the founder of the Alexandrian Museum, and of his son,  Ptolemy Philadelphus; and later to Rome, where it remained for many  centuries, and where bibliophiles and bibliomaniacs were gradually  evolved, and from whence in time other countries were invaded.    For the purposes of the present work the middle ages cover the period  beginning with the seventh century and ending with the time of the  invention of printing, or about seven hundred years, though they are more  accurately bounded by the years 500 and 1500 A. D. It matters little,  however, since there is no attempt at chronological arrangement.    About the middle of the present century there began to be a disposition  to grant to mediaeval times their proper place in the history of the  preservation and dissemination of books, and Merryweather's _Bibliomania  in the Middle Ages_ was one of the earliest works in English devoted to  the subject. Previous to that time, those ten centuries lying between the  fall of the Roman Empire and the revival of learning were generally  referred to as the Dark Ages, and historians and other writers were wont  to treat them as having been without learning or scholarship of any kind.    Even Mr. Hallam,[1] with all that judicial temperament and patient  research to which we owe so much, could find no good to say of the Church  or its institutions, characterizing the early university as the abode of  \"indigent vagabonds withdrawn from usual labor,\" and all monks as  positive enemies of learning.    The gloomy survey of Mr. Hallam, clouded no doubt by his antipathy to all  things ecclesiastical, served, however, to arouse the interest of the  period, which led to other studies with different results, and later  writers were able to discern below the surface of religious fanaticism  and superstition so characteristic of those centuries, much of interest  in the history of literature; to show that every age produced learned and  inquisitive men by whom books were highly prized and industriously  collected for their own sakes; in short, to rescue the period from the  stigma of absolute illiteracy.    If the reader cares to pursue the subject further, after going through  the fervid defense of the love of books in the middle ages, of which this  is the introduction, he will find outside of its chapters abundant  evidence that the production and care of books was a matter of great  concern. In the pages of _Mores Catholici; or Ages of Faith_, by Mr.  Kenelm Digby,[2] or of _The Dark Ages_, by Dr. S. R. Maitland,[3] or of  that great work of recent years, _Books and their Makers during the  Middle Ages_, by Mr. George Haven Putnam,[4] he will see vivid and  interesting portraits of a great multitude of mediaeval worthies who were  almost lifelong lovers of learning and books, and zealous laborers in  preserving, increasing and transmitting them. And though little of the  mass that has come down to us was worthy of preservation on its own  account as literature, it is exceedingly interesting as a record of  centuries of industry in the face of such difficulties that to workers of  a later period might have seemed insurmountable.    A further fact worthy of mention is that book production was from the art  point of view fully abreast of the other arts during the period, as must  be apparent to any one who examines the collections in some of the  libraries of Europe. Much of this beauty was wrought for the love of the  art itself. In the earlier centuries religious institutions absorbed  nearly all the social intellectual movements as well as the possession of  material riches and land. Kings and princes were occupied with distant  wars which impoverished them and deprived literature and art of that  patronage accorded to it in later times. There is occasional mention,  however, of wealthy laymen, whose religious zeal induced them to give  large sums of money for the copying and ornamentation of books; and there  were in the abbeys and convents lay brothers whose fervent spirits,  burning with poetical imagination, sought in these monastic retreats and  the labor of writing, redemption from their past sins. These men of faith  were happy to consecrate their whole existence to the ornamentation of a  single sacred book, dedicated to the community, which gave them in  exchange the necessaries of life.    The labor of transcribing was held, in the monasteries, to be a full  equivalent of manual labor in the field. The rule of St. Ferreol, written  in the sixth century, says that, \"He who does not turn up the earth with  the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers.\"    Mention has been made of the difficulties under which books were  produced; and this is a matter which we who enjoy the conveniences of  modern writing and printing can little understand. The hardships of the  _scriptorium_ were greatest, of course, in winter. There were no fires in  the often damp and ill-lighted cells, and the cold in some of the parts  of Europe where books were produced must have been very severe.  Parchment, the material generally used for writing upon after the  seventh century, was at some periods so scarce that copyists were  compelled to resort to the expedient of effacing the writing on old and  less esteemed manuscripts.[5] The form of writing was stiff and regular  and therefore exceedingly slow and irksome.    In some of the monasteries the _scriptorium_ was at least at a later  period, conducted more as a matter of commerce, and making of books  became in time very profitable. The Church continued to hold the keys of  knowledge and to control the means of productions; but the cloistered  cell, where the monk or the layman, who had a penance to work off for a  grave sin, had worked in solitude, gave way to the apartment specially  set aside, where many persons could work together, usually under the  direction of a _librarius_ or chief scribe. In the more carefully  constructed monasteries this apartment was so placed as to adjoin the  calefactory, which allowed the introduction of hot air, when needed.    The seriousness with which the business of copying was considered is well  illustrated by the consecration of the _scriptorium_ which was often  done in words which may be thus translated: \"Vouchsafe, O Lord, to bless  this work-room of thy servants, that all which they write therein may be  comprehended by their intelligence and realized in their work.\"    While the work of the scribes was largely that of copying the scriptures,  gospels, and books of devotion required for the service of the church,  there was a considerable trade in books of a more secular kind.  Particularly was this so in England. The large measure of attention given  to the production of books of legends and romances was a distinguishing  feature of the literature of England at least three centuries previous to  the invention of printing. At about the twelfth century and after, there  was a very large production and sale of books under such headings as  chronicles, satires, sermons, works of science and medicine, treatises on  style, prose romances and epics in verse. Of course a large proportion of  these were written in or translated from the Latin, the former indicating  a pretty general knowledge of that language among those who could buy or  read books at all. That this familiarity with the Latin tongue was not  confined to any particular country is abundantly shown by various  authorities.    Mr. Merryweather, whose book, as has been intimated, is only a defense  of bibliomania itself as it actually existed in the middle ages, gives  the reader but scant information as to processes of book-making at that  time. But thanks to the painstaking research of others, these details are  now a part of the general knowledge of the development of the book. The  following, taken from Mr. Theodore De Vinne's _Invention of Printing_,  will, we think, be found interesting:    \"The size most in fashion was that now known as the demy folio, of which  the leaf is about ten inches wide and fifteen inches long, but smaller  sizes were often made. The space to be occupied by the written text was  mapped out with faint lines, so that the writer could keep his letters on  a line, at even distance from each other and within the prescribed  margin. Each letter was carefully drawn, and filled in or painted with  repeated touches of the pen. With good taste, black ink was most  frequently selected for the text; red ink was used only for the more  prominent words, and the catch-letters, then known as the rubricated  letters. Sometimes texts were written in blue, green, purple, gold or  silver inks, but it was soon discovered that"]]]
