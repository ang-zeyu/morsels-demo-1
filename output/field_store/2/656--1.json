Sketch of the History of Greek Literature                      from the Earliest Times to the Reign of                      Alexander the Great.          CHAPTER I.    GEOGRAPHY OF GREECE.    Greece is the southern portion of a great peninsula of Europe, washed  on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea.  It is bounded on the north by  the Cambunian mountains, which separate it from Macedonia.  It extends  from the fortieth degree of latitude to the thirty-sixth, its greatest  length being not more than 250 English miles, and its greatest breadth  only 180.  Its surface is considerably less than that of Portugal.  This small area was divided among a number of independent states, many  of them containing a territory of only a few square miles, and none of  them larger than an English county.  But the heroism and genius of the  Greeks have given an interest to the insignificant spot of earth  bearing their name, which the vastest empires have never equalled.    The name of Greece was not used by the inhabitants of the country.  They called their land HELLAS, and themselves HELLENES. At first the  word HELLAS signified only a small district in Thessaly, from which the  Hellenes gradually spread over the whole country.  The names of GREECE  and GREEKS come to us from the Romans, who gave the name of GRAECIA to  the country and of GRAECI to the inhabitants.    The two northerly provinces of Greece are THESSALY and EPIRUS,  separated from each other by Mount Pindus.  Thessaly is a fertile plain  enclosed by lofty mountains, and drained by the river Peneus, which  finds its way into the sea through the celebrated Vale of Tempe.  Epirus is covered by rugged ranges of mountains running from north to  south, through which the Achelous the largest river of Greece, flows  towards the Corinthian gulf.    In entering central Greece from Thessaly the road runs along the coast  through the narrow pass of Thermopylae, between the sea and a lofty  range of mountains.  The district along the coast was inhabited by the  EASTERN LOCRIANS, while to their west were DORIS and PHOCIS, the  greater part of the latter being occupied by Mount Parnassus, the abode  of the Muses, upon the slopes of which lay the town of Delphi with its  celebrated oracle of Apollo. South of Phocis is Boeotia, which is a  large hollow basin, enclosed on every side by mountains, which prevent  the waters from flowing into the sea.  Hence the atmosphere was damp  and thick, to which circumstance the witty Athenians attributed the  dullness of the inhabitants.  Thebes was the chief city of Boeotia.  South of Boeotia lies ATTICA, which is in the form of a triangle,  having two of its sides washed by the sea and its base united to the  land.  Its soil is light and dry and is better adapted for the growth  of fruit than of corn.  It was particularly celebrated for its olives,  which were regarded as the gift of Athena (Minerva), and were always  under the care of that goddess.  Athens was on the western coast,  between four and five miles from its port, Piraeus.  West of Attica,  towards the isthmus, is the small district of MEGARIS.    The western half of central Greece consists of WESTERN LOCRIS, AETOLIA  and ACARNANIA.  These districts were less civilised than the other  countries of Greece, and were the haunts of rude robber tribes even as  late as the Peloponnesian war.    Central Greece is connected with the southern peninsula by a narrow  isthmus, on which stood the city of Corinth.  So narrow is this isthmus  that the ancients regarded the peninsula as an island, and gave to it  the name of PELOPONNESUS, or the island of Pelops, from the mythical  hero of this name.  Its modern name, the MOREA, was bestowed upon it  from its resemblance to the leaf of the mulberry.    The mountains of Peloponnesus have their roots in the centre of the  country, from which they branch out towards the sea.  This central  region, called ARCADIA, is the Switzerland of the peninsula.  It is  surrounded by a ring of mountains, forming a kind of natural wall,  which separates it from the remaining Peloponnesian states.  The other  chief divisions of Peloponnesus were Achaia, Argolis, Laconia,  Messenia, and Elis.  ACHAIA is a narrow slip of country lying between  the northern barrier of Arcadia and the Corinthian gulf.  ARGOLIS, on  the east, contained several independent states, of which the most  important was Argos.  LACONIA and MESSENIA occupied the whole of the  south of the peninsula from sea to sea:  these two countries were  separated by the lofty range of Taygetus, running from north to south,  and terminating in the promontory of Taenarum (now Cape Matapan), the  southernmost point of Greece and Europe.  Sparta, the chief town of  Laconia, stood in the valley of the Eurotas, which opens out into a  plain of considerable extent towards the Laconian gulf. Messenia, in  like manner, was drained by the Pamisus, whose plain is still more  extensive and fertile than that of the Eurotas. ELIS, on the west of  Arcadia, contains the memorable plain of Olympia, through which the  Alpheus flows, and in which the city of Pisa stood.    Of the numerous islands which line the Grecian shores, the most  important was Euboea, stretching along the coasts of Boeotia and  Attica.  South of Euboea was the group of islands called the CYCLADES,  lying around Delos as a centre; and east of these were the SPORADES,  near the Asiatic coast.  South of these groups are the large islands of  CRETE and RHODES.    The physical features of the country exercised an important influence  upon the political destinies of the people.  Greece is one of the most  mountainous countries of Europe.  Its surface is occupied by a number  of small plains, either entirely surrounded by limestone mountains or  open only to the sea.  Each of the principal Grecian cities was founded  in one of these small plains; and, as the mountains which separated it  from its neighbours were lofty and rugged, each city grew up in  solitary independence.  But at the same time it had ready and easy  access to the sea, and Arcadia was almost the only political division  that did not possess some territory upon the coast.  Thus shut out from  their neighbours by mountains, the Greeks were naturally attracted to  the sea, and became a maritime people.  Hence they possessed the love  of freedom and the spirit of adventure, which have always  characterised, more or less the inhabitants of maritime districts.        CHAPTER II.    ORIGIN OF THE GREEKS AND THE HEROIC AGE.    No nation possesses a history till events are recorded in written  documents; and it was not till the epoch known by the name of the First  Olympiad, corresponding to the year 776 B.C., that the Greeks began to  employ writing as a means for perpetuating the memory of any historical  facts.  Before that period everything is vague and uncertain; and the  exploits of the heroes related by the poets must not be regarded as  historical facts.    The PELASGIANS are universally represented as the most ancient  inhabitants of Greece.  They were spread over the Italian as well as  the Grecian peninsula; and the Pelasgic language thus formed the basis  of the Latin as well as of the Greek.  They were divided into several  tribes, of which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20967"],[0,"A Guide to Peterborough Cathedral (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net              [Illustration: Peterborough Cathedral--West Front]      [ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.]        A GUIDE TO PETERBOROUGH CATHEDRAL;      COMPRISING A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MONASTERY    FROM ITS FOUNDATION TO THE PRESENT TIME,    WITH A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF ITS ARCHITECTURAL    PECULIARITIES AND RECENT IMPROVEMENTS;    COMPILED FROM THE WORKS OF GUNTON, BRITTON,    AND ORIGINAL & AUTHENTIC DOCUMENTS.

CHAPTER I.    _From the foundation of the monastery by Peada, A.D. 655, to its  destruction by fire in the reign of Henry the First;--embracing a  period of 461 years._      The history of our monastic establishments is but little regarded and  as little known. The obscurity in which all monastic institutions is  involved renders it difficult to give any certain and positive  information respecting the origin of the building to whose history  these pages are devoted; but it appears to have been founded at a very  early period--the churches of Canterbury, Rochester, London, Westminster,  York, and Winchester, being the only large sacred edifices that  preceded it. The date of the first building is stated to have been A.D.  655--fifty-eight years after the introduction of Christianity into  England by St. Augustine; and so large were the foundation stones, that  it required eight yoke of oxen to draw them. From this it may be  inferred that the structure was not, like many of the Anglo-Saxon  churches of this period--built entirely of wood; though it was probably  far inferior in size and style of architecture to the building which  succeeded it.    It was one of the kings of Mercia who laid the foundation of the  monastery of _Medeshamstede_[1] in 655; his name was Peada, the eldest  son of Penda, the fourth monarch of that kingdom. The facts are thus  related by the Saxon chronicler:--\"From the beginning of the world had  now elapsed 5,850 winters, when Peada the son of Penda assumed the  government of the Mercians. In his time came together himself and  Osway, brother of King Oswald, and said they would rear a _minster_ to  the glory of Christ and honour of Saint Peter; and they did so, and  gave it the name of _Medeshamstede_, because there is a well there  called _Medeswell_. And they began the ground-wall and wrought thereon,  after which they committed the work to a monk, whose name was Saxulf.  Peada reigned no while, for he was betrayed by his own queen in  Eastertide, 658.\"    Wolfere was the youngest son of Penda, and when Peada died, King Osway  assumed the government of Mercia, and ruled very despotically for about  three years, when the nobles, incensed at his conduct, rebelled against  him, drove him from the kingdom, and chose Wolfere for their king. It  was in his reign that \"_Medeshamstede_ waxed rich,\" for Wolfere not  only caused the monastery to be built, but he endowed it with a great  number of lands, and made it \"not subject except to Rome alone;\" and  the abbey, which was by this time completed, was dedicated with great  pomp and ceremony to \"Christ and St. Peter,\" and hallowed in the name  of \"Saint Peter and Saint Andrew.\"    Saxulf, who had superintended the building of the abbey, was the first  abbot whose name is mentioned in the monkish chronicles as its ruler.  He was remarkable for his learning, piety, and humility, and was  chiefly instrumental in bringing Christianity into the kingdom of  Mercia. Both Saxulf and Cuthbaldus who succeeded him were abbots of the  monastery during the rule of Wolfere, although there is little mention  made of either in the records which have been handed down to us.    Wolfere died in 683, and was succeeded by his brother Ethelred, who  contributed very largely to the monastery, and secured to it by his  interest extraordinary privileges. Those who could not afford to go to  Rome to offer up vows and get absolved from their sins were allowed  both indulgences at this monastery, and could likewise receive \"the  apostolical benediction.\" Ethelred built a house for the abbot, which  is now the palace of the bishop, but, excepting for its antiquity, it  possesses no features of interest.    After a reign of thirty years, Ethelred exchanged the insignia of  royalty for the rough garments of a monk, and became abbot of Bardney,  in Lincolnshire, where he died, in the year, 716.    From the death of Cuthbaldus to the accession of Beonna in 775, there  is a blank in the history of the monastery. During his rule one or two  important concessions were made to the monks by King Offa.    The name of the next abbot was Celredus, but of him nothing particular  is recorded. He was succeeded by Hedda, in 833, during whose abbacy the  first destruction of the monastery by the Danes occurred, which founded  an important era in the history of this institution. A band of savage  Danes, headed by Earl Hubba, invaded the territory of the Mercians, and  after committing numerous depredations in the country, they plundered  the monastery of Croyland, and proceeded to attack _Medeshamstede_.  The monks of this abbey had, however, gained intelligence of their  intentions, and having closed the gates, resolved to act on the  defensive. Hubba and his desperadoes soon surrounded them, and demanded  that the gates should be opened; and when he was told that he should  not enter, he commenced to batter the walls. In the course of the  attack, one of the monks hurled a great stone from the top of the  building upon the besiegers, and Tulba, the brother of Hubba, was  killed by it. This so incensed the earl, that he vowed to put every  monk to death by his own hand; and having forced the gates, proceeded  to put his horrible threat into execution,--robbed the monastery of  everything that was valuable, and then set it on fire. It burned  fifteen days. All the portable valuables were then packed on waggons  and taken away. The plunder, however, is said to have been lost,  \"either in the Nen or in the neighbouring marshes.\"[2] This was in 870.    In a short time a few monks who escaped at Croyland re-assembled at  their abbey there, and after electing Godric their abbot, proceeded to  _Medeshamstede_, and buried the monks of that monastery who had been  murdered by the Danish invaders in one vast tomb. Godric likewise had  their effigies cut out in stone (a representation of which is here  shown, the original being in the Lady Chapel),[3] and, to honour their  memory, he went every year to weep over the grave in which he had laid  his brethren.    From this time until the reign of Alfred the Great [872] the monastery  of _Medeshamstede_ was frequently invaded, and the lands which  belonged to it were seized by the conquerors. It was left for the  wisdom and courage of Alfred to restore that tranquility to England  which it had so long lost, and to give protection and security to his  subjects. The Danes who had committed so many depredations before his  accession to the throne were now beaten back and finally checked by the  powerful fleet which he built to protect the kingdom from invasion.  King Edgar, who succeeded Alfred, followed his example in this respect,  and kept up the strength of the fleet. By this means increased security  was given to England, and the people, comparatively happy in their  internal government, and freed from the fear of foreign interruption,  began to improve their public buildings and religious houses.    It was in 966 that the monastery of _Medeshamstede_ was rebuilt after  the old model, at the instigation of Athelwold, who was at that time  Bishop of Winchester. King Edgar assisted in the re-construction of the  monastery; and so important did he consider religion to be in the  amelioration of the morals of his subjects, that he is said to have  rebuilt upwards of forty religious establishments during his reign.    [Illustration: Ancient Monumental Stone in the Cathedral.]    After the abbey of _Medeshamstede_ was finished in 972, he ratified all  the former charters which it possessed, and gave it the name of Burgh.    The first abbot of the monastery, after its destruction, was called  Adulphus, formerly the king's chancellor; but having accidentally been  the cause of the death of his only son, he could no longer live happily  in the world, and he therefore endowed the abbey with all his wealth,  and was elected its first abbot.    The monastery of _Burgh_ was now in a more prosperous and wealthy  condition than ever; all the neighbouring country was subject to it,  and its possessions were so immense that its name was changed to  _Gildenburg_. Adulphus, wishing to increase the value of the estates of  the monastery and to encourage agriculture, had all the surrounding  forests cut down and the lands cultivated. He was afterwards made  Archbishop of York, [992,] and the eloquent Kenulfus succeeded him in  the reign of Ethelred. Kenulfus built a high wall round the monastery,  part of which is still in existence. He was translated to the see of  Winchester, in 1006, and was so celebrated for his virtue and learning,  that he gave a character to the monastery, and the monks were for a  long time afterwards considered the most enlightened and intelligent  men in the island.    Elsinus was the next abbot of whom we read in connection with the  monastery, and was remarkable for the number of relics which he had  collected. Gunton tells us that the arm of St. Oswald[4] was the most  famous, and Walter de Whittlesea informs us that King Stephen came to  _Peterburgh_ to witness the miracles which it is said to have  performed. During the abbacy of Elsinus, England "]]]
