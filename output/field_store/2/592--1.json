IN THREE VOLUMES      VOL. I.--1837-1843      LONDON  JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET, W.  1908    _Copyright in Great Britain and Dependencies, 1907, by_ H.M. THE KING.    _In the United States by_ Messrs LONGMANS, GREEN & CO.    _All rights reserved._          PREFACE      Entrusted by His Majesty the King with the duty of making a selection  from Queen Victoria's correspondence, we think it well to describe  briefly the nature of the documents which we have been privileged to  examine, as well as to indicate the principles which have guided us  throughout. It has been a task of no ordinary difficulty. Her Majesty  Queen Victoria dealt with her papers, from the first, in a most  methodical manner; she formed the habit in early days of preserving  her private letters, and after her accession to the Throne all her  official papers were similarly treated, and bound in volumes. The  Prince Consort instituted an elaborate system of classification,  annotating and even indexing many of the documents with his own hand.  The result is that the collected papers form what is probably the most  extraordinary series of State documents in the world. The papers which  deal with the Queen's life up to the year 1861 have been bound  in chronological order, and comprise between five and six hundred  volumes. They consist, in great part, of letters from Ministers  detailing the proceedings of Parliament, and of various political  memoranda dealing with home, foreign, and colonial policy; among these  are a few drafts of Her Majesty's replies. There are volumes concerned  with the affairs of almost every European country; with the history  of India, the British Army, the Civil List, the Royal Estates, and all  the complicated machinery of the Monarchy and the Constitution. There  are letters from monarchs and royal personages, and there is further  a whole series of volumes dealing with matters in which the  Prince Consort took a special interest. Some of them are arranged  chronologically, some by subjects. Among the most interesting volumes  are those containing the letters written by Her Majesty to her uncle  Leopold, King of the Belgians, and his replies.[1] The collection  of letters from and to Lord Melbourne forms another hardly less  interesting series. In many places Queen Victoria caused extracts,  copied from her own private Diaries, dealing with important political  events or describing momentous interviews, to be inserted in the  volumes, with the evident intention of illustrating and completing the  record.        [Footnote 1: A set of volumes containing the Queen's letters      to Lord John Russell came into our hands too late to be made      use of for the present publication.]    It became obvious at once that it was impossible to deal with these  papers exhaustively. They would provide material for a historical  series extending to several hundred volumes. Moreover, on the other  hand, there are many gaps, as a great deal of the business of State  was transacted by interviews of which no official record is preserved.    His Majesty the King having decided that no attempt should be made to  publish these papers _in extenso_, it was necessary to determine upon  some definite principle of selection. It became clear that the only  satisfactory plan was to publish specimens of such documents as  would serve to bring out the development of the Queen's character and  disposition, and to give typical instances of her methods in dealing  with political and social matters--to produce, in fact, a book for  British citizens and British subjects, rather than a book for  students of political history. That the inner working of the unwritten  constitution of the country; that some of the unrealised checks and  balances; that the delicate equipoise of the component parts of our  executive machinery, should stand revealed, was inevitable. We have  thought it best, throughout, to abstain from unnecessary comment and  illustration. The period is so recent, and has been so often traversed  by historians and biographers, that it appeared to us a waste of  valuable space to attempt to reconstruct the history of the years  from which this correspondence has been selected, especially as Sir  Theodore Martin, under the auspices of the Queen herself, has dealt so  minutely and exhaustively with the relations of the Queen's innermost  circle to the political and social life of the time. It is tempting,  of course, to add illustrative anecdotes from the abundant Biographies  and Memoirs of the period; but our aim has been to infringe as little  as possible upon the space available for the documents themselves,  and to provide just sufficient comment to enable an ordinary reader,  without special knowledge of the period, to follow the course of  events, and to realise the circumstances under which the Queen's  childhood was passed, the position of affairs at the time of her  accession, and the personalities of those who had influenced her in  early years, or by whom she was surrounded.    The development of the Queen's character is clearly indicated in the  papers, and it possesses an extraordinary interest. We see one of  highly vigorous and active temperament, of strong affections, and with  a deep sense of responsibility, placed at an early age, and after a  quiet girlhood, in a position the greatness of which it is impossible  to exaggerate. We see her character expand and deepen, schooled by  mighty experience into patience and sagacity and wisdom, and yet never  losing a particle of the strength, the decision, and the devotion with  which she had been originally endowed. Up to the year 1861 the  Queen's career was one of unexampled prosperity. She was happy in her  temperament, in her health, in her education, in her wedded life, in  her children. She saw a great Empire grow through troubled times in  liberty and power and greatness; yet this prosperity brought with it  no shadow of complacency, because the Queen felt with an increasing  depth the anxieties and responsibilities inseparable from her great  position. Her happiness, instead of making her self-absorbed, only  quickened her beneficence and her womanly desire that her subjects  should be enabled to enjoy a similar happiness based upon the same  simple virtues. Nothing comes out more strongly in these documents  than the laborious patience with which the Queen kept herself informed  of the minutest details of political and social movements both in her  own and other countries.    It is a deeply inspiring spectacle to see one surrounded by every  temptation which worldly greatness can present, living from day to  day so simple, vivid, and laborious a life; and it is impossible to  conceive a more fruitful example of duty and affection and energy,  displayed on so august a scale, and in the midst of such magnificent  surroundings. We would venture to believe that nothing could so deepen  the personal devotion of the Empire to the memory of that great Queen  who ruled it so wisely and so long, and its deeply-rooted attachment  to the principle of constitutional monarchy, as the gracious act of  His Majesty the King in allowing the inner side of that noble life and  career to be more clearly revealed to a nation whose devotion to their  ancient liberties is inseparably connected with their loyalty to the  Throne.

In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have  written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when  the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable  danger to the settlers. I have done this, not with the intention of  extending your knowledge, or even of pointing a moral, although the  story is not without one; but simply for a change--a change both  for you and myself, but frankly, more for myself than for you. You  know the old story of the boy who bothered his brains with Euclid,  until he came to dream regularly that he was an equilateral  triangle enclosed in a circle. Well, I feel that unless I break  away sometimes from history, I shall be haunted day and night by  visions of men in armour, and soldiers of all ages and times.    If, when I am away on a holiday I come across the ruins of a  castle, I find myself at once wondering how it could best have been  attacked, and defended. If I stroll down to the Thames, I begin to  plan schemes of crossing it in the face of an enemy; and if matters  go on, who can say but that I may find myself, some day, arrested  on the charge of surreptitiously entering the Tower of London, or  effecting an escalade of the keep of Windsor Castle! To avoid such  a misfortune--which would entail a total cessation of my stories,  for a term of years--I have turned to a new subject, which I can  only hope that you will find as interesting, if not as instructive,  as the other books which I have written.    G. A. Henty.        Chapter 1: The Broken Window.      \"You are the most troublesome boy in the village, Reuben Whitney,  and you will come to a bad end.\"    The words followed a shower of cuts with the cane. The speaker was  an elderly man, the master of the village school of Tipping, near  Lewes, in Sussex; and the words were elicited, in no small degree,  by the vexation of the speaker at his inability to wring a cry from  the boy whom he was striking. He was a lad of some thirteen years  of age, with a face naturally bright and intelligent; but at  present quivering with anger.    \"I don't care if I do,\" he said defiantly. \"It won't be my fault,  but yours, and the rest of them.\"    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" the master said, \"instead of  speaking in that way. You, who learn easier than anyone here, and  could always be at the top of your class, if you chose. I had hoped  better things of you, Reuben; but it's just the way, it's your  bright boys as mostly gets into mischief.\"    At this moment the door of the school room opened, and a lady with  two girls, one of about fourteen and the other eleven years of age,  entered.    \"What is the matter now?\" the lady asked, seeing the schoolmaster,  cane in hand, and the boy standing before him.    \"Reuben Whitney! What, in trouble again, Reuben? I am afraid you  are a very troublesome boy.\"    \"I am not troublesome, ma'm,\" the boy said sturdily. \"That is, I  wouldn't be if they would let me alone; but everything that is done  bad, they put it down to me.\"    \"But what have you been doing now, Reuben?\"    \"I have done nothing at all, ma'm; but he's always down on me,\" and  he pointed to the master, \"and when they are always down on a  fellow, it's no use his trying to do right.\"    \"What has the boy been doing now, Mr. White?\" the lady asked.    \"Look there, ma'm, at those four windows all smashed, and the  squire had all the broken panes mended only a fortnight ago.\"    \"How was it done, Mr. White?\"    \"By a big stone, ma'm, which caught the frame where they joined,  and smashed them all.\"    \"I did not do it, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I didn't.\"    \"Why do you suppose it was Reuben?\" Mrs. Ellison asked the master.    \"Because I had kept him in, half an hour after the others went home  to dinner, for pinching young Jones and making him call out; and he  had only just gone out of the gate when I heard the smash; so there  is no doubt about it, for all the others must have been in at their  dinner at that time.\"    \"I didn't do it, ma'm,\" the boy repeated. \"Directly I got out of  the gate, I started off to run home. I hadn't gone not twenty yards  when I heard a smash; but I wasn't going for to stop to see what it  was. It weren't no business of mine, and that's all I know about  it.\"    \"Mamma,\" the younger of the two girls said eagerly, \"what he says  is quite true. You know you let me run down the village with the  jelly for Mrs. Thomson's child, and as I was coming down the road I  saw a boy come out of the gate of the school and run away; and then  I heard a noise of broken glass, and I saw another boy jump over  the hedge opposite, and run, too. He came my way and, directly he  saw me, he ran to a gate and climbed over.\"    \"Do you know who it was, Kate?\" Mrs. Ellison asked.    \"Yes, mamma. It was Tom Thorne.\"    \"Is Thomas Thorne here?\" Mrs. Ellison asked in a loud voice.    There was a general turning of the heads of the children to the  point where a boy, somewhat bigger than the rest, had been  apparently studying his lessons with great diligence.    \"Come here, Tom Thorne,\" Mrs. Ellison said.    The boy slouched up with a sullen face.    \"You hear what my daughter says, Tom. What have you to say in  reply?\"    \"I didn't throw the stone at the window,\" the boy replied. \"I  chucked it at a sparrow, and it weren't my fault if it missed him  and broke the window.\"    \"I should say it was your fault, Tom,\" Mrs. Ellison said  sharply--\"very much your fault, if you throw a great stone at a  bird without taking care to see what it may hit. But that is  nothing to your fault in letting another boy be punished for what  you did. I shall report the matter to the squire, and he will speak  to your father about it. You are a wicked, bad boy.    \"Mr. White, I will speak to you outside.\"    Followed by her daughters, Mrs. Ellison went out; Kate giving a  little nod, in reply to the grateful look that Reuben Whitney cast  towards her, and his muttered:    \"Thank you, miss.\"    \"Walk on, my dears,\" Mrs. Ellison said. \"I will overtake you, in a  minute or two.    \"This will not do, Mr. White,\" she said, when she was alone with  the master. \"I have told you before that I did not approve of your  thrashing so much, and now it is proved that you punish without any  sufficient cause, and upon suspicion only. I shall report the case  at once to the squire and, unless I am greatly mistaken, you will  have to look out for another place.\"    \"I am very sorry, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I am; and it is not often I  use the cane, now. If it had been anyone else, I might have  believed him; but Reuben Whitney is always in mischief.\"    \"No wonder he is in mischief,\" the lady said severely, \"if he is  punished, without a hearing, for all the misdeeds of others. Well,  I shall leave the matter in the squire's hands; but I am sure he  will no more approve than I do of the children being ill treated.\"    Reuben Whitney was the son of a miller, near Tipping. John Whitney  had been considered a well-to-do man, but he had speculated in corn  and had got into difficulties; and his body was, one day, found  floating in the mill dam. No one knew whether it was the result of  intention or accident, but the jury of his neighbours who sat upon  the inquest gave him the benefit of the doubt, and brought in a  verdict of \"accidental death.\" He was but tenant of the mill and,  when all the creditors were satisfied, there were only a few pounds  remaining for the widow.    With these she opened a little shop in Tipping, with a  miscellaneous collection of tinware and cheap ironmongery; cottons,  tapes, and small articles of haberdashery; with toys, sweets, and  cakes for the children. The profits were small, but the squire, who  had known her husband, charged but a nominal rent for the cottage;  and this was more than paid by the fruit trees in the garden, which  also supplied her with potatoes and vegetables, so that she managed  to support her boy and herself in tolerable comfort.    She herself had been the daughter of a tradesman in Lewes, and many  wondered that she did not return to her father, upon her husband's  death. But her home had not been a comfortable one, before her  marriage; for her father had taken a second wife, and she did not  get on well with her stepmother. She thought, therefore, that  anything would be better than returning with her boy to a home  where, to the mistress at least, she would be most unwelcome.    She had, as a girl, received an education which raised her somewhat  above the other villagers of Tipping; and of an evening she was in  the habit of helping Reuben with his lessons, and trying to correct  the broadness of dialect which he picked up from the other boys.  She was an active and bustling woman, managed her little shop well,  and kept the garden, with Reuben's assistance, in excellent order.    Mrs. Ellison had, at her first arrival in the village three years  before, done much to give her a good start, by ordering that all  articles of use for the house, in which she dealt, should be  purchased of her; and she highly approved of the energy and"]]]
