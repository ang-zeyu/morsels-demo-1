For assistance in the preparation of this second edition, I desire  herewith to express my obligations to several friends:--To the late Rev.  L. G. Hasse, B.D., whose knowledge of Moravian history was profound, and  who guided me safely in many matters of detail; to the Rev. N. Libbey,  M.A., Principal of the Moravian Theological College, Fairfield, for the  loan of valuable books; to the Rev. J. T. Mueller, D.D., Archivist  at Herrnhut, for revising part of the MS., and for many helpful  suggestions; to Mr. W. T. Waugh, M.A., for assistance in correcting the  proof-sheets, and for much valuable criticism; to the members of the  Moravian Governing Board, not only for the loan of books and documents  from the Fetter Lane archives, but also for carefully reading through  the MS.; to the ministers who kindly supplied my pulpit for three  months; and last, but not least, to the members of my own congregation,  who relieved me from some pastoral duties to enable me to make good  speed with my task.    MORAVIAN MANSE,    HECKMONDWIKE.          BOOK ONE. THE BOHEMIAN BRETHREN.          CHAPTER I -- THE RISING STORM.    When an ordinary Englishman, in the course of his reading, sees mention  made of Moravians, he thinks forthwith of a foreign land, a foreign  people and a foreign Church. He wonders who these Moravians may be,  and wonders, as a rule, in vain. We have all heard of the Protestant  Reformation; we know its principles and admire its heroes; and the  famous names of Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, Latimer, Cranmer, Knox and  other great men are familiar in our ears as household words. But few  people in this country are aware of the fact that long before Luther had  burned the Pope's bull, and long before Cranmer died at the stake, there  had begun an earlier Reformation, and flourished a Reforming Church. It  is to tell the story of that Church--the Church of the Brethren--that  this little book is written.    For her cradle and her earliest home we turn to the distressful land  of Bohemia, and the people called Bohemians, or Czechs. To us English  readers Bohemia has many charms. As we call to mind our days at school,  we remember, in a dim and hazy way, how famous Bohemians in days of yore  have played some part in our national story. We have sung the praises at  Christmas time of the Bohemian Monarch, \"Good King Wenceslaus.\" We have  read how John, the blind King of Bohemia, fell mortally wounded at the  Battle of Crecy, how he died in the tent of King Edward III., and how  his generous conqueror exclaimed: \"The crown of chivalry has fallen  today; never was the like of this King of Bohemia.\" We have all read,  too, how Richard II. married Princess Anne of Bohemia; how the Princess,  so the story goes, brought a Bohemian Bible to England; how Bohemian  scholars, a few years later, came to study at Oxford; how there they  read the writings of Wycliffe, the \"Morning Star of the Reformation\";  and how, finally, copies of Wycliffe's books were carried to Bohemia,  and there gave rise to a religious revival of world-wide importance.  We have struck the trail of our journey. For one person that Wycliffe  stirred in England, he stirred hundreds in Bohemia. In England his  influence was fleeting; in Bohemia it was deep and abiding. In England  his followers were speedily suppressed by law; in Bohemia they became  a great national force, and prepared the way for the foundation of the  Church of the Brethren.    For this startling fact there was a very powerful reason. In many ways  the history of Bohemia is very like the history of Ireland, and the best  way to understand the character of the people is to think of our Irish  friends as we know them to-day. They sprang from the old Slavonic stock,  and the Slavonic is very like the Keltic in nature. They had fiery  Slavonic blood in their veins, and Slavonic hearts beat high with hope  in their bosoms. They had all the delightful Slavonic zeal, the Slavonic  dash, the Slavonic imagination. They were easy to stir, they were swift  in action, they were witty in speech, they were mystic and poetic in  soul, and, like the Irish of the present day, they revelled in the joy  of party politics, and discussed religious questions with the keenest  zest. With them religion came first and foremost. All their poetry was  religious; all their legends were religious; and thus the message of  Wycliffe fell on hearts prepared to give it a kindly welcome.    Again, Bohemia, like Ireland, was the home of two rival populations. The  one was the native Czech, the other was the intruding German; and the  two had not yet learned to love each other. From all sides except one  these German invaders had come. If the reader will consult a map of  Europe he will see that, except on the south-east frontier, where the  sister country, Moravia, lies, Bohemia is surrounded by German-speaking  States. On the north-east is Silesia, on the north-west Saxony, on the  west Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate, and thus Bohemia was flooded  with Germans from three sides at once. For years these Germans had  been increasing in power, and the whole early history of Bohemia is  one dreary succession of bloody wars against German Emperors and Kings.  Sometimes the land had been ravaged by German soldiers, sometimes a  German King had sat on the Bohemian throne. But now the German settlers  in Bohemia had become more powerful than ever. They had settled in large  numbers in the city of Prague, and had there obtained special privileges  for themselves. They had introduced hundreds of German clergymen, who  preached in the German language. They had married their daughters into  noble Bohemian families. They had tried to make German the language of  the court, had spoken with contempt of the Bohemian language, and had  said that it was only fit for slaves. They had introduced German laws  into many a town, and German customs into family life; and, worse than  all, they had overwhelming power in that pride of the country, the  University of Prague. For these Germans the hatred of the people was  intense. \"It is better,\" said one of their popular writers, \"for the  land to be a desert than to be held by Germans; it is better to marry a  Bohemian peasant girl than to marry a German queen.\" And Judas Iscariot  himself, said a popular poet, was in all probability a German.    Again, as in Ireland, these national feuds were mixed up with religious  differences. The seeds of future strife were early sown. Christianity  came from two opposite sources. On the one hand, two preachers, Cyril  and Methodius, had come from the Greek Church in Constantinople, had  received the blessing of the Pope, and had preached to the people in the  Bohemian language; on the other, the German Archbishop of Salzburg had  brought in hosts of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21003"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Ely (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the msny original illustrations.

It is hardly necessary to give a complete list of all the authorities  consulted in the preparation of this book. As specially valuable for Ely  may be named the \"Liber Eliensis\" and the \"Inquisitio Eliensis\"; the  histories of Bentham, Hewett, and Stewart; the \"Memorials of Ely,\" and  the Handbook to the Cathedral edited and revised by the late Dean;  Professor Freeman's Introduction to Farren's \"Cathedral Cities of Ely  and Norwich\"; and the various reports of Sir G. G. Scott. But numerous  other sources of information have been examined, and have supplied facts  or theories; and in nearly every instance, particularly where the very  words are quoted, the authority is given in the text or in the notes.    My best thanks are due to the Dean of Ely for his ready courtesy in  allowing free access to every part of the cathedral and for his solution  of various difficulties which had presented themselves in comparing  different accounts of the fabric. I have also to thank the Rev. T.  Perkins and the Photochrom Company for the use of the photographs from  which the illustrations have been prepared. For many curious details,  and for the loan of some books that are out of print and difficult to  obtain, I acknowledge my obligation to Mr. C. Johnson, of Ely.                                                       W. D. SWEETING.            LIST OF CONTENTS.      I. THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING                                  3    II.

The district known as the Isle of Ely--which now  includes the whole of the northern part of Cambridgeshire above the  River Ouse, together with a few parishes east of that river that are in  the county--is spoken of at the time of the marriage of the princess as  if it were a district well known and perhaps of some importance, as it  was assigned to her as a dowry. Some writers have held that the  expression the Isle of Ely applied only to the rising ground on which  the city now stands and to its immediate neighbourhood. If this were  ever the case, the name was soon used for a larger district. In the  \"Liber Eliensis\" the limits of the isle are given as seven miles in  length by four in breadth, while the extent of the two hundreds  belonging to Ely reaches from Tydd to Upware and from Bishop's Delf to  Peterborough. We have many examples of large inland districts where a  series of rivers has happened to isolate them being known as isles. The  Isles of Athelney, Axholme, Purbeck, Thanet, are familiar instances.  Perhaps the town is more likely to take its name from the district than  the district from the town. It will be seen that in none of the examples  just given is the name derived from a town. We have the authority of  Bede for the statement that Ely (_Elge_) was a region containing about  six hundred families, like an island (_in similitudinem insulae_), and  surrounded by marshes or waters.    When told that Ely means the \"Island of Eels,\" many persons suppose this  to be a fanciful etymology, and smile at the idea; but the best  authorities are agreed that this is the true derivation of the name.[1]  A suggestion that the willow-trees, so abundant in the region, gave the  name (Celtic, _Helyg_) has met with some support. A third suggestion,"]]]
