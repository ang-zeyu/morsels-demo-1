Upon my return, after a forced and prolonged absence, to the Holy Land, it  is my first and most ardent wish to renew and strengthen those ties of  brotherly love and fellowship that bind our hearts together in our common  servitude to His Sacred Threshold.    The two years that have elapsed since the passing of our beloved Master  have been for the Cause, as well as for mankind, years of deep anxiety and  strain. The momentous changes that are taking place in the history of both  have proved so swift and far-reaching as to arouse in certain hearts a  strange misgiving as to their stability and future.    On one hand the remarkable revelations of the Beloved's Will and Testament  so amazing in all its aspects, so emphatic in its injunctions, have  challenged and perplexed the keenest minds, whilst the ever-increasing  confusion of the world, threatened as never before with disruptive forces,  fierce rivalries, fresh commotions and grave disorder, have well-nigh  overwhelmed the heart and damped the zeal of even the most enthusiastic  believers in the destiny of mankind.    And yet, how often we seem to forget the clear and repeated warnings of  our beloved Master, who in particular during the concluding years of his  mission on earth, laid stress on the severe mental tests that would  inevitably sweep over his loved ones of the West ... tests that would  purge, purify and prepare them for their noble mission in life.    And as to the world's evil plight, we need but recall the writings and  sayings of Baha'u'llah, who, more than fifty years ago, declared in terms  prophetic the prime cause of the ills and sufferings of mankind, and set  forth their true and divine remedy. \"Should the lamp of Religion be  hidden\", He declared, \"chaos and confusion will ensue.\" How admirably  fitting and applicable are these words to the present state of mankind!    Ours then is the duty and privilege to labour, by day, by night, amidst  the storm and stress of these troublous days, that we may quicken the zeal  of our fellow-man, rekindle their hopes, stimulate their interests, open  their eyes to the true Faith of God and enlist their active support in the  carrying out of our common task for the peace and regeneration of the  world.    Let us take heart and be thankful to our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, as we  remember his manifold blessings and unfailing care and protection, ever  since the hour of his departure from our midst. The flames of sedition, so  maliciously kindled in the past by those who have dared to flout his will,  are gone out for ever, and the fondest hopes of these evil plotters are  now abandoned, doomed never to revive. He has indeed redeemed his promise!    It seemed not a long time ago that their agitation, so violently renewed  immediately after the passing of our Beloved, would for a time confuse the  Divine Message of Baha'u'llah, obscure His Covenant, retard the progress  of His Cause, and shatter its unity; and yet how well we see them all  today, not through our efforts, but by their own folly, and above all, by  the intervention of the hidden hand of God, reduced to the vilest and most  humiliating position.    And now, with the Cause purified and inwardly victorious, Its principles  vindicated, Its enemies silenced and sunk in unspeakable misery, may we  not, henceforth, direct all our efforts to collective action and  constructive achievement; and in utter disregard of the flickerings of  their fast-fading light, arise to carry out those urgent measures that  will secure the outward and complete triumph of the Cause?    I for my part, as I look back to the unfortunate circumstances of  ill-health and physical exhaustion that have attended the opening years of  my career of service to the Cause, feel hardly gratified, and would be  truly despondent but for the sustaining memory and inspiring example of  the diligent and ceaseless efforts which my fellow-workers the world over  have displayed during these two trying years in the service of the Cause.    I cherish the hope that, from now on the Beloved may bestow upon me all  the strength and vigour that will enable me to pursue over a long and  unbroken period of strenuous labour the supreme task of achieving, in  collaboration with the friends in every land, the speedy triumph of the  Cause of Baha'u'llah. This is the prayer I earnestly request all my fellow  brethren and sisters in the Faith to offer on my behalf.    Let us pray to God that in these days of world encircling gloom, when the  dark forces of nature, of hate, rebellion, anarchy and reaction are  threatening the very stability of human society, when the most precious  fruits of civilization are undergoing severe and unparalleled tests, we  may all realize, more profoundly than ever, that though but a mere handful  amidst the seething masses of the world, are in this day the chosen  instruments of God's Grace, that our Mission is most urgent and vital to  the fate of humanity and, fortified by these sentiments, arise to achieve  God's holy purpose for mankind.    Your brother in His service  Shoghi  for my beloved brethren and sisters in Australia and New Zealand--Shoghi.    Haifa, Palestine,  December 2, 1923.            LETTER OF MAY 15TH, 1934      May 15th, 1934    Dear Baha'i Friend,    The Guardian has deeply appreciated your message dated April 10th, and he  has asked me to convey to you once more his grateful thanks for the  services you are so continually rendering the Faith in your centre. The  gratifying news has just reached him of the opening of the first  Convention of the Baha'is of Australia and New-Zealand, and needless to  say how deeply he was moved by this historic step you have been inspired  to take for the consolidation of the Administration in your country. He  feels confident that through such remarkable evidences of the  self-sacrificing, heroic and united efforts of the Australian and New  Zealand believers an increasing number of hitherto skeptical and  unfriendly people will be gradually attracted to the Faith, and some of  them will eventually join the ranks of the faithful.    Assuring you again of the Guardian's fervent prayers for the continued  expansion of your Baha'i activities, and with his best wishes and  greetings to you and to all the friends in Adelaide,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.

It  will commemorate at once the hundreth anniversary of the inception of the  Babi Dispensation, of the inauguration of the Baha'i Era, of the  commencement of the Baha'i Cycle, and of the birth of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The  weight of the potentialities with which this Faith, possessing no peer or  equal in the world's spiritual history, and marking the culmination of a  universal prophetic cycle, has been endowed, staggers our imagination. The  brightness of the millennial glory which it must shed in the fullness of  time dazzles our eyes. The magnitude of the shadow which its Author will  continue to cast on successive Prophets destined to be raised up after Him  eludes our calculation.    Already in the space of less than a century the operation of the  mysterious processes generated by its creative spirit has provoked a  tumult in human society such as no mind can fathom. Itself undergoing a  period of incubation during its primitive age, it has, through the  emergence of its slowly-crystallizing system, induced a fermentation in  the general life of mankind designed to shake the very foundations of a  disordered society, to purify its life-blood, to reorientate and  reconstruct its institutions, and shape its final destiny.    To what else can the observant eye or the unprejudiced mind, acquainted  with the signs and portents heralding the birth, and accompanying the  rise, of the Faith of Baha'u'llah ascribe this dire, this planetary  upheaval, with its attendant destruction, misery and fear, if not to the  emergence of His embryonic World Order, which, as He Himself has  unequivocally proclaimed, has \"deranged the equilibrium of the world and  revolutionized mankind's ordered life\"? To what agency, if not to the  irresistible diffusion of that world-shaking, world-energizing,  world-redeeming spirit, which the Bab has affirmed is \"vibrating in the  innermost realities of all created things\" can the origins of this  portentous crisis, incomprehensible to man, and admittedly unprecedented  in the annals of the human race, be attributed? In the convulsions of  contemporary society, in the frenzied, world-wide ebullitions of men's  thoughts, in the fierce antagonisms inflaming races, creeds and classes,  in the shipwreck of nations, in the downfall of kings, in the  dismemberment of empires, in the extinction of dynasties, in the collapse  of ecclesiastical hierarchies, in the deterioration of time-honored  institutions, in the dissolution of ties, secular as well as religious,  that had for so long held together the members of the human race--all  manifesting themselves with ever-increasing gravity since the outbreak of  the first World War that immediately preceded the opening years of the  Formative Age of the Faith of Baha'u'llah--in these we can readily  recognize the evidences of the travail of an age that has sustained the  impact of His Revelation, that has ignored His summons, and is now  laboring to be delivered of its burden, as a direct consequence of the  impulse communicated to it by the generative, the purifying, the  transmuting influence of His Spirit.    It is my purpose, on the occasion of an anniversary of such profound  significance, to attempt in the succeeding pages a survey of the  outstanding events of the century that has seen this Spirit burst forth  upon the world, as well as the initial stages of its subsequent  incarnation in a System that must evolve into an Order designed to embrace  the whole of mankind, and capable of fulfilling the high destiny that  awaits man on this planet. I shall endeavor to review, in their proper  perspective and despite the comparatively brief space of time which  separates us from them, the events which the revolution of a hundred  years, unique alike in glory and tribulation, has unrolled before our  eyes. I shall seek to represent and correlate, in however cursory a  manner, those momentous happenings which have insensibly, relentlessly,  and under the very eyes of successive generations, perverse, indifferent  or hostile, transformed a heterodox and seemingly negligible offshoot of  the _Sh_ay_kh_i school of the I_th_na-'A_sh_'ariyyih sect of _Sh_i'ah  Islam into a world religion whose unnumbered followers are organically and  indissolubly united; whose light has overspread the earth as far as  Iceland in the North and Magellanes in the South; whose ramifications have  spread to no less than sixty countries of the world; whose literature has  been translated and disseminated in no less than forty languages; whose  endowments in the five continents of the globe, whether local, national or  international, already run into several million dollars; whose  incorporated elective bodies have secured the official recognition of a  number of governments in East and West; whose adherents are recruited from  the diversified races and chief religions of mankind; whose  representatives are to be found in hundreds of cities in both Persia and  the United States of America; to whose verities royalty has publicly and  repeatedly testified; whose independent status its enemies, from the ranks  of its parent religion and in the leading center of both the Arab and  Muslim worlds, have proclaimed and demonstrated; and whose claims have  been virtually recognized, entitling it to rank as the fourth religion of  a Land in which its world spiritual center has been established, and which  is at once the heart of Christendom, the holiest shrine of the Jewish  people, and, save Mecca alone, the most sacred spot in Islam.    It is not my purpose--nor does the occasion demand it,--to write a detailed  history of the last hundred years of the Baha'i Faith, nor do I intend to  trace the origins of so tremendous a Movement, or to portray the  conditions under which it was born, or to examine the character of the  religion from which it has sprung, or to arrive at an estimate of the  effects which its impact upon the fortunes of mankind has produced. I  shall rather content myself with a review of the salient features of its  birth and rise, as well as of the initial stages in the establishment of  its administrative institutions--institutions which must be regarded as the  nucleus and herald of that World Order that must incarnate the soul,  execute the laws, and fulfill the purpose of the Faith of God in this day.    Nor will it be my intention to ignore, whilst surveying the panorama which  the revolution of a hundred years spreads before our gaze, the swift  interweaving of seeming reverses with evident victories, out of which the  hand of an inscrutable Providence has chosen to form the pattern of the  Faith from its earliest days, or to minimize those disasters that have so  often proved themselves to be the prelude to fresh "]]]
