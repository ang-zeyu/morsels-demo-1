Nothing is more simple  than to realise this distinction when you do not go deeply into it;  nothing is more difficult when you analyse it a little. At first  sight, it seems impossible to confuse things so far apart as a thought  and a block of stone; but on reflection this great contrast vanishes,  and other differences have to be sought which are less apparent and of  which one has not hitherto dreamed.    First let us say how the question presents itself to us. The fact  which we must take as a starting point, for it is independent of  every kind of theory, is that there exists something which is  \"knowable.\" Not only science, but ordinary life and our everyday  conversation, imply that there are things that we know. It is with  regard to these things that we have to ask ourselves if some belong to  what we call the mind and others to what we call matter.    Let us suppose, by way of hypothesis, the knowable to be entirely and  absolutely homogeneous. In that case we should be obliged to set aside  the question as one already decided. Where everything is homogeneous,  there is no distinction to be drawn. But this hypothesis is, as we all  know, falsified by observation. The whole body of the knowable is  formed from an agglomeration of extremely varied elements, amongst  which it is easy to distinguish a large number of divisions. Things  may be classified according to their colour, their shape, their  weight, the pleasure they give us, their quality of being alive or  dead, and so on; one much given to classification would only be  troubled by the number of possible distinctions.    Since so many divisions are possible, at which shall we stop and say:  this is the one which corresponds exactly to the opposition of mind  and matter? The choice is not easy to make; for we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],[0,"The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#1)"],[1,"TALE OF                       MISS KITTY CAT                            _SLUMBER-TOWN TALES_                   (Trademark Registered)                              BY                    ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY                           AUTHOR OF                    _SLEEPY-TIME TALES_                   (Trademark Registered)                     _TUCK-ME-IN TALES_                   (Trademark Registered)                              BY                    ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY                   THE TALE OF THE MULEY COW                 THE TALE OF OLD DOG SPOT                 THE TALE OF GRUNTY PIG                 THE TALE OF HENRIETTA HEN                 THE TALE OF TURKEY PROUDFOOT                 THE TALE OF PONY TWINKLEHEELS                 THE TALE OF MISS KITTY CAT          [Illustration: Miss Kitty Cat Chased Old Dog Spot. _Frontispiece_]                            _SLUMBER-TOWN TALES_                   (Trademark Registered)                          THE TALE OF                      MISS KITTY CAT                              BY                    ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY                           Author of                     \"SLEEPY-TIME TALES\"                   (Trademark Registered)                            AND                     \"TUCK-ME-IN TALES\"                   (Trademark Registered)                        ILLUSTRATED BY                      HARRY L.

She was altogether too fond of hunting them. They agreed, however, that  in one way it was pleasant to have her about the farmhouse. When she  washed her face, while sitting on the doorsteps, they knew--so they  said!--that it was going to rain. And then Mrs. Rat never would let her  husband leave home without taking his umbrella.    As a rule Miss Kitty Cat didn't look at all frightful. Almost always she  appeared quite unruffled, going about her business in a quiet way and  making no fuss over anything. Of course when old dog Spot chased--and  cornered--her, she was quite a different sort of creature. Then she  arched her back, puffed her tail out to twice its usual size, and spat  fiercely at Spot. He learned not to get within reach of her sharp claws,  when she behaved in that fashion. For old Spot had a tender nose. And no  one knew it better than Miss Kitty Cat.    Around the farmhouse she was politeness itself--when there was anybody  to observe her. If her meals were late she never clamored, as Johnnie  Green sometimes did. To be sure, she might remind Mrs. Green gently, by  plaintive mewing, that she had not had her saucer of milk. But she was  always careful not to be rude about it. And though Miss Kitty liked a  warm place in winter, she never crowded anybody else away from the fire.  She crept under the kitchen range, where no one else cared to sit. And  there she would doze by the hour--especially after she had enjoyed a  hearty meal.    On summer nights, however, when she loved to hunt out of doors, Miss  Kitty Cat was far from appearing sleepy. She roamed about the fields, or  crept through the tree-tops with a stealthy tread and a tigerish working  of her tail. Folk smaller than Miss Kitty never cared to meet her at  such times. They knew that she would spring upon them if she had a  chance. So they took good care to keep out of her way. And if they  caught sight of her when she had her hunting manner they always gave  the alarm in their own fashion, warning their friends to beware of the  monster Miss Kitty Cat, because she was abroad and in a dangerous mood.    Johnnie Green liked Miss Kitty. Often she would come to him and rub  against him and purr, fairly begging him to stroke her back. Unless he  pulled her tail at such times she kept her claws carefully out of sight  and basked under Johnnie's petting.    If he had been her size and she had been his, Miss Kitty Cat might not  have been so harmless. She might have played with Johnnie, as she  sometimes played with a mouse. But Johnnie Green never stopped to think  of anything like that. And if he had, he would have thought it a great  joke. He would have laughed at the idea of Miss Kitty Cat holding him  beneath her paw.          II    DOG SPOT'S PLANS      SOMEHOW old dog Spot and Miss Kitty Cat never became good friends. By  the time Miss Kitty Cat arrived on the farm in Pleasant Valley Spot had  lived there several years.    From the first day he met Miss Kitty in the kitchen Spot hadn't liked  her. Yet he claimed at the time that he was glad to see her. He said  that he could tell at once that he was going to have great sport with  her. He knew it would be fun to chase her!    Inside the farmhouse old Spot was careful how he behaved. The moment  Miss Kitty first set eyes on him she scurried under the table, where  she crouched and glared at him. That was scarcely what you might call a  friendly greeting. And Spot would have barked at her had he dared.    Since he didn't, he only whined a bit through his nose. You couldn't  have told what he meant by the sound.    Miss Kitty Cat didn't like his whining. She even opened her mouth wide  and said as much. She made an odd hissing noise, which amused old Spot  greatly. And he told Miss Kitty, in what was almost a growl (except that  it wasn't loud enough for one), \"Wait till I catch you out of doors, my  lady! I'll have some fun with you.\"    Then Farmer Green's wife opened the door and told Spot to be gone.    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself--\" she scolded--\"teasing a poor  little cat!\"    Old dog Spot tucked his tail between his legs and crept through the  doorway, keeping one eye on the broom that Mrs. Green held in her hand.  And as soon as he was safely outside he gave two or three sharp yelps,  telling Miss Kitty Cat that he would watch for her the very first time  she set foot in the yard.    Somehow Miss Kitty Cat wasn't specially worried. She knew a thing or two  about dogs; and she didn't intend to let old Spot bully her. It took her  a few minutes to get over her anger. And then she came out from beneath  the table and lapped up the milk that Mrs. Green had set temptingly on  the floor, in a saucer.    When Miss Kitty had finished her meal she washed her face--a duty that  she performed with great care, for she prided herself on always looking  neat.    Watching her, no one would ever have guessed what was in her mind. \"I'd  like to wash that dog's face for him!\" Miss Kitty was saying to herself.  \"He'd have some reason then for yelping and whining.\"    Having completed her toilet Miss Kitty jumped into a chair that stood in  the sunshine, near a window. And there she composed herself for a nap.  When she was well fed and well warmed she liked nothing better than to  curl herself up and doze and dream.    Meanwhile old dog Spot was telling everybody in the farmyard about the  new cat and the fun he intended to have with her.    \"There'll be lively times around here when she comes outside the house,\"  he chuckled.          III    CHASING MISS KITTY      WHEN Miss Kitty Cat awoke from her nap she got up and stretched herself.  In her opinion, a nap was no nap at all if one didn't stretch after  taking it. \"There's nothing like a good stretch to make a person  limber,\" she often remarked.    Of course, in order to climb trees, or spring successfully at a rat or a  mouse, Miss Kitty had to keep her muscles supple. And since it happened,  now and then, that others jumped unexpectedly at her, she believed in  always being ready either to chase or to be chased.    After she had smoothed her fur to suit her, Miss Kitty went to the door  and mewed patiently until Farmer Green's wife opened it. Then Miss Kitty  Cat slipped out of the kitchen and found herself in the woodshed. A  highly interesting place, it seemed to her, with any number of crannies  to offer lurking-places for mice. She decided at once that the woodshed  would be a fine spot in which to hunt in stormy weather.    Feeling much pleased with her new home, Miss Kitty hopped down upon the  great flat stone that served as a step from the woodshed to the ground.  She couldn't help thinking, as she sat there, what a pleasant yard  Farmer Green had. She noticed that there were trees enough about the  farmhouse to furnish homes for plenty of birds.    And if there was one thing that Miss Kitty Cat liked it was to visit  birds right where they lived.    Seeing a faint stir in the grass not far away, she began to creep  towards it. Miss Kitty had found that it paid to look into such things.  Often she had surprised a meadow mouse in just that way.    This time, however, it was Miss Kitty Cat herself that was surprised.  She was so intent on her own important business that"]]]
