I am always thinking of those kind  friends! I beg for each and all of you confirmations and assistance from  the threshold of oneness, so that those gatherings may become ignited like  unto candles, in the republics of America, enkindling the light of the  love of God in the hearts; thus the rays of the heavenly teachings may  begem and brighten the states of America like the infinitude of immensity  with the stars of the Most Great Guidance.    3 The Northeastern States on the shores of the Atlantic--Maine, New  Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont,  Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York--in some of these states believers  are found, but in some of the cities of these states up to this date  people are not yet illumined with the lights of the Kingdom and are not  aware of the heavenly teachings; therefore, whenever it is possible for  each one of you, hasten ye to those cities and shine forth like unto the  stars with the light of the Most Great Guidance. God says in the glorious  Qur'an: \"The soil was black and dried. Then we caused the rain to descend  upon it and immediately it became green, verdant, and every kind of plant  sprouted up luxuriantly.\"(1) In other words, He says the earth is black,  but when the spring showers descend upon it that black soil is quickened,  and variegated flowers are pushed forth. This means the souls of humanity  belonging to the world of nature are black like unto the soil. But when  the heavenly outpourings descend and the radiant effulgences appear, the  hearts are resuscitated, are liberated from the darkness of nature and the  flowers of divine mysteries grow and become luxuriant. Consequently man  must become the cause of the illumination of the world of humanity and  propagate the holy teachings revealed in the sacred books through the  divine inspiration. It is stated in the blessed Gospel: Travel ye toward  the East and toward the West and enlighten the people with the light of  the Most Great Guidance, so that they may take a portion and share of  eternal life.(2) Praise be to God, that the Northeastern States are in the  utmost capacity. Because the ground is rich, the rain of the divine  outpouring is descending. Now you must become heavenly farmers and scatter  pure seeds in the prepared soil. The harvest of every other seed is  limited, but the bounty and the blessing of the seed of the divine  teachings is unlimited. Throughout the coming centuries and cycles many  harvests will be gathered. Consider the work of former generations. During  the lifetime of Jesus Christ the believing, firm souls were few and  numbered, but the heavenly blessings descended so plentifully that in a  number of years countless souls entered beneath the shadow of the Gospel.  God has said in the Qur'an: \"One grain will bring forth seven sheaves, and  every sheaf shall contain one hundred grains.\"(3) In other words, one  grain will become seven hundred; and if God so wills He will double these  also. It has often happened that one blessed soul has become the cause of  the guidance of a nation. Now we must not consider our ability and  capacity, nay, rather, we must fix our gaze upon the favors and bounties  of God, in these days, Who has made of the drop a sea, and of the atom a  sun.    4 Upon you be greeting and praise!            2: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES      _Revealed on March 27, 1916, in the garden adjacent to the Shrine of  Baha'u'llah, addressed to the Baha'is of sixteen Southern States of the  United States: Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North  Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,  Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. _    1 O ye heralds of the Kingdom of God:    2 A few days ago an epistle was written to those divine believers, but  because these days are the days of Naw-Ruz, you have come to my mind and I  am sending you this greeting for this glorious feast. All the days are  blessed, but this feast is the national fete of Persia. The Persians have  been holding it for several thousand years past. In reality every day  which man passes in the mention of God, the diffusion of the fragrances of  God and calling the people to the Kingdom of God, that day is his feast.  Praise be to God that you are occupied in the service of the Kingdom of  God and are engaged in the promulgation of the religion of God by day and  by night. Therefore all your days are feast days. There is no doubt that  the assistance and the bestowal of God shall descend upon you.    3 In the Southern States of the United States, the friends are few, that  is, in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South  Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky,  Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Consequently you must either go  yourselves or send a number of blessed souls to those states, so that they  may guide the people to the Kingdom of Heaven. One of the holy  Manifestations, addressing a believing soul, has said that, if a person  become the cause of the illumination of one soul, it is better than a  boundless treasury. \"O 'Ali! If God guide, through thee, one soul, it is  better for thee than all the riches!\" Again He says, \"Direct us to the  straight path!\"(4) that is, Show us the right road. It is also mentioned  in the Gospel: Travel ye to all parts of the world and give ye the glad  tidings of the appearance of the Kingdom of God.(5)    4 In brief, I hope you will display in this respect the greatest effort  and magnanimity. It is assured that you will become assisted and  confirmed. A person declaring the glad tidings of the appearance of the  realities and significances of the Kingdom is like unto a farmer who  scatters pure seeds in the rich soil. The spring cloud will pour upon them  the rain of bounty, and unquestionably the station of the farmer will be  raised in the estimation of the lord of the village, and many harvests  will be gathered.    5 Therefore, ye friends of God! Appreciate ye the value of this time and  be ye engaged in the sowing of the seeds, so that you may find the  heavenly blessing and the lordly bestowal. Upon you be Baha'u'l-Abha!            3: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE CENTRAL STATES      _Revealed on March 29, 1916, outside the house in Bahji, and addressed to  the Baha'is of twelve Central States of the United States: Michigan,  Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North  Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. _    1 O ye heavenly souls, O ye spiritual assemblies, O ye lordly meetings:    2 For some time past correspondence has been delayed, and this has been on  account of the difficulty of mailing and receiving letters. But because at  present a number of facilities are obtainable, therefore, I am engaged in  writing you this brief epistle so that my heart and soul may obtain joy  and fragrance through the remembrance of the friends. Continually this  wanderer supplicates and entreats at the threshold of His Holiness the One  and begs assistance, bounty and heavenly confirmations in behalf of the  believers. You are always in my thoughts. You are not nor shall you ever  be forgotten. I hope by the favor of His Holiness the Almighty that day by  day you may add to your faith, assurance, firmness and steadfastness, and  become instruments for the promotion of the holy fragrances.    3 Although in the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and  Minnesota--praise be to God--believers are found who are associating with  each other in the utmost "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#1)"],[1,"World Order of Baha'u'llah      by Shoghi Effendi          Edition 1, (September 2006)                                       BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.

Dearly-beloved co-workers:    I have been acquainted by the perusal of your latest communications with  the nature of the doubts that have been publicly expressed, by one who is  wholly misinformed as to the true precepts of the Cause, regarding the  validity of institutions that stand inextricably interwoven with the Faith  of Baha'u'llah. Not that I for a moment view such faint misgivings in the  light of an open challenge to the structure that embodies the Faith, nor  is it because I question in the least the unyielding tenacity of the faith  of the American believers, if I venture to dwell upon what seems to me  appropriate observations at the present stage of the evolution of our  beloved Cause. I am indeed inclined to welcome these expressed  apprehensions inasmuch as they afford me an opportunity to familiarize the  elected representatives of the believers with the origin and the character  of the institutions which stand at the very basis of the World Order  ushered in by Baha'u'llah. We should feel truly thankful for such futile  attempts to undermine our beloved Faith--attempts that protrude their ugly  face from time to time, seem for a while able to create a breach in the  ranks of the faithful, recede finally into the obscurity of oblivion, and  are thought of no more. Such incidents we should regard as the  interpositions of Providence, designed to fortify our faith, to clarify  our vision, and to deepen our understanding of the essentials of His  Divine Revelation.          Sources of the Baha'i World Order      It would, however, be helpful and instructive to bear in mind certain  basic principles with reference to the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  which, together with the Kitab-i-Aqdas, constitutes the chief depository  wherein are enshrined those priceless elements of that Divine  Civilization, the establishment of which is the primary mission of the  Baha'i Faith. A study of the provisions of these sacred documents will  reveal the close relationship that exists between them, as well as the  identity of purpose and method which they inculcate. Far from regarding  their specific provisions as incompatible and contradictory in spirit,  every fair-minded inquirer will readily admit that they are not only  complementary, but that they mutually confirm one another, and are  inseparable parts of one complete unit. A comparison of their contents  with the rest of Baha'i sacred Writings will similarly establish the  conformity of whatever they contain with the spirit as well as the letter  of the authenticated writings and sayings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha.  In fact, he who reads the Aqdas with care and diligence will not find it  hard to discover that the Most Holy Book itself anticipates in a number of  passages the institutions which 'Abdu'l-Baha ordains in His Will. By  leaving certain matters unspecified and unregulated in His Book of Laws,  Baha'u'llah seems to have deliberately left a gap in the general scheme of  Baha'i Dispensation, which the unequivocal provisions of the Master's Will  have filled. To attempt to divorce the one from the other, to insinuate  that the Teachings of Baha'u'llah have not been upheld, in their entirety  and with absolute integrity, by what 'Abdu'l-Baha has revealed in His  Will, is an unpardonable affront to the unswerving fidelity that has  characterized the life and labors of our beloved Master.    I will not attempt in the least to assert or demonstrate the authenticity  of the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, for that in itself would betray  an apprehension on my part as to the unanimous confidence of the believers  in the genuineness of the last written wishes of our departed Master. I  will only confine my observations to those issues which may assist them to  appreciate the essential unity that underlies the spiritual, the  humanitarian, and the administrative principles enunciated by the Author  and the Interpreter of the Baha'i Faith.    I am at a loss to explain that strange mentality that inclines to uphold  as the sole criterion of the truth of the Baha'i Teachings what is  admittedly only an obscure and unauthenticated translation of an oral  statement made by 'Abdu'l-Baha, in defiance and total disregard of the  available text of all of His universally recognized writings. I truly  deplore the unfortunate distortions that have resulted in days past from  the incapacity of the interpreter to grasp the meaning of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  and from his incompetence to render adequately such truths as have been  revealed to him by the Master's statements. Much of the confusion that has  obscured the understanding of the believers should be attributed to this  double error involved in the inexact rendering of an only partially  understood statement. Not infrequently has the interpreter even failed to  convey the exact purport of the inquirer's specific questions, and, by his  deficiency of understanding and expression in conveying the answer of  'Abdu'l-Baha, has been responsible for reports wholly at variance with the  true spirit and purpose of the Cause. It was chiefly in view of the  misleading nature of the reports of the informal conversations of  'Abdu'l-Baha with visiting pilgrims, that I have insistently urged the  believers of the West to regard such statements as merely personal  impressions of the sayings of their Master, and to quote and consider as  authentic only such translations as are based upon the authenticated text  of His recorded utterances in the original tongue.    It should be remembered by every follower of the Cause that the system of  Baha'i administration is not an innovation imposed arbitrarily upon the  Baha'is of the world since the Master's passing, but derives its authority  from the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, is specifically prescribed in  unnumbered Tablets, and rests in some of its essential features upon the  explicit provisions of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. It thus unifies and correlates  the principles separately laid down by Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, and  is indissolubly bound with the essential verities of the Faith. To  dissociate the administrative principles of the Cause from the purely  spiritual and humanitarian teachings would be tantamount to a mutilation  of the body of the Cause, a separation that can only result in the  disintegration of its component parts, and the"]]]
