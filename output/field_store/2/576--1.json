Conan Doyle      Do I know why Tom Donahue is called \"Lucky Tom\"? Yes, I do; and that is  more than one in ten of those who call him so can say. I have knocked  about a deal in my time, and seen some strange sights, but none stranger  than the way in which Tom gained that sobriquet, and his fortune with  it. For I was with him at the time. Tell it? Oh, certainly; but it is a  longish story and a very strange one; so fill up your glass again, and  light another cigar, while I try to reel it off. Yes, a very strange  one; beats some fairy stories I have heard; but it's true, sir, every  word of it. There are men alive at Cape Colony now who'll remember it  and confirm what I say. Many a time has the tale been told round the  fire in Boers' cabins from Orange state to Griqualand; yes, and out in  the bush and at the diamond-fields too.    I'm roughish now, sir; but I was entered at the Middle Temple once, and  studied for the bar. Tom--worse luck!--was one of my fellow-students;  and a wildish time we had of it, until at last our finances ran short,  and we were compelled to give up our so-called studies, and look about  for some part of the world where two young fellows with strong arms and  sound constitutions might make their mark. In those days the tide of  emigration had scarcely begun to set in toward Africa, and so we thought  our best chance would be down at Cape Colony. Well,--to make a long  story short,--we set sail, and were deposited in Cape Town with less  than five pounds in our pockets; and there we parted. We each tried our  hands at many things, and had ups and downs; but when, at the end of  three years, chance led each of us up-country and we met again, we were,  I regret to say, in almost as bad a plight as when we started.    Well, this was not much of a commencement; and very disheartened we  were, so disheartened that Tom spoke of going back to England and  getting a clerkship. For you see we didn't know that we had played out  all our small cards, and that the trumps were going to turn up. No; we  thought our \"hands\" were bad all through. It was a very lonely part of  the country that we were in, inhabited by a few scattered farms, whose  houses were stockaded and fenced in to defend them against the Kaffirs.  Tom Donahue and I had a little hut right out in the bush; but we were  known to possess nothing, and to be handy with our revolvers, so we  had little to fear. There we waited, doing odd jobs, and hoping that  something would turn up. Well, after we had been there about a month  something did turn up upon a certain night, something which was the  making of both of us; and it's about that night, sir, that I'm going to  tell you. I remember it well. The wind was howling past our cabin, and  the rain threatened to burst in our rude window. We had a great wood  fire crackling and sputtering on the hearth, by which I was sitting  mending a whip, while Tom was lying in his bunk groaning disconsolately  at the chance which had led him to such a place.    \"Cheer up, Tom--cheer up,\" said I. \"No man ever knows what may be  awaiting him.\"    \"Ill luck, ill luck, Jack,\" he answered. \"I always was an unlucky dog.  Here have I been three years in this abominable country; and I see lads  fresh from England jingling the money in their pockets, while I am as  poor as when I landed. Ah, Jack, if you want to keep your head above  water, old friend, you must try your fortune away from me.\"    \"Nonsense, Tom; you're down in your luck to-night. But hark! Here's some  one coming outside. Dick Wharton, by the tread; he'll rouse you, if any  man can.\"    Even as I spoke the door was flung open, and honest Dick Wharton, with  the water pouring from him, stepped in, his hearty red face looming  through the haze like a harvest-moon. He shook himself, and after  greeting us sat down by the fire to warm himself.    \"Where away, Dick, on such a night as this?\" said I. \"You'll find the  rheumatism a worse foe than the Kaffirs, unless you keep more regular  hours.\"    Dick was looking unusually serious, almost frightened, one would say,  if one did not know the man. \"Had to go,\" he replied--\"had to go. One  of Madison's cattle was seen straying down Sasassa Valley, and of course  none of our blacks would go down _that_ valley at night; and if we had  waited till morning, the brute would have been in Kaffirland.\"    \"Why wouldn't they go down Sasassa Valley at night?\" asked Tom.    \"Kaffirs, I suppose,\" said I.    \"Ghosts,\" said Dick.    We both laughed.    \"I suppose they didn't give such a matter-of-fact fellow as you a sight  of their charms?\" said Tom, from the bunk.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, seriously, \"yes; I saw what the niggers talk about;  and I promise you, lads, I don't want ever to see it again.\"    Tom sat up in his bed. \"Nonsense, Dick; you're joking, man! Come, tell  us all about it; the legend first, and your own experience afterward.  Pass him over the bottle, Jack.\"    \"Well, as to the legend,\" began Dick. \"It seems that the niggers have  had it handed down to them that Sasassa Valley is haunted by a frightful  fiend. Hunters and wanderers passing down the defile have seen its  glowing eyes under the shadows of the cliff; and the story goes  that whoever has chanced to encounter that baleful glare has had his  after-life blighted by the malignant power of this creature. Whether  that be true or not,\" continued Dick, ruefully, \"I may have an  opportunity of judging for myself.\"    \"Go on, Dick--go on,\" cried Tom. \"Let's hear about what you saw.\"    \"Well, I was groping down the valley, looking for that cow of Madison's,  and I had, I suppose, got half-way down, where a black craggy cliff juts  into the ravine on the right, when I halted to have a pull at my  flask. I had my eye fixed at the time upon the projecting cliff I have  mentioned, and noticed nothing unusual about it. I then put up my flask  and took a step or two forward, when in a moment there burst, apparently  from the base of the rock, about eight feet from the ground and  a hundred yards from me, a strange, lurid glare, flickering and  oscillating, gradually dying away and then reappearing again. No, no;  I've seen many a glow-worm and firefly--nothing of that sort. There it  was, burning away, and I suppose I gazed at it, trembling in every limb,  for fully ten minutes. Then I took a step forward, when instantly it  vanished, vanished like a candle blown out. I stepped back again; but it  was some time before I could find the exact spot and position from  which it was visible. At last, there it was, the weird reddish light,  flickering away as before. Then I screwed up my courage, and made for  the rock; but the ground was so uneven that it was impossible to steer  straight; and though I walked along the whole base of the cliff, I could  see nothing. Then I made tracks for home; and I can tell you, boys,  that, until you remarked it, I never knew it was raining, the whole way  along. But hollo! what's the matter with Tom?\"    What indeed? Tom was now sitting with his legs over the side of the  bunk, and his whole face betraying excitement so intense as to be almost  painful. \"The fiend would have two eyes. How many lights did you see,  Dick? Speak out!\"    \"Only one.\"    \"Hurrah!\" cried Tom, \"that's better.\" Whereupon he kicked the blankets  into the middle of the room, and began pacing up and down with long  feverish strides. Suddenly he stopped opposite Dick, and laid his hand  upon his shoulder. \"I say, Dick, could we get to Sasassa Valley before  sunrise?\"    \"Scarcely,\" said Dick.    \"Well, look here; we are old friends, Dick Wharton, you and I. Now don't  you tell any other man what you have told us, for a week. You'll promise  that, won't you?\"    I could see by the look on Dick's face as he acquiesced that he  considered poor Tom to be mad; and indeed I was myself completely  mystified by his conduct. I had, however, seen so many proofs of my  friend's good sense and quickness of apprehension that I thought it  quite possible that Wharton's story had had a meaning in his eyes which  I was too obtuse to take in.    All night Tom Donahue was greatly excited, and when Wharton left  he begged him to remember his promise, and also elicited from him a  description of the exact spot at which he had seen the apparition, as  well as the hour at which it appeared. After his departure, which must  have been about four in the morning, I turned into my bunk and watched  Tom sitting by the fire splicing two sticks together, until I fell  asleep. I suppose I must have slept about two hours; but when I awoke  Tom was still sitting working away in almost the same position. He had  fixed the one stick across the top of the other so as to form a rough T,  and was now busy in fitting a smaller stick into the angle between  them, by manipulating which, the cross one could be either cocked up or  depressed to any extent. He had cut notches, too, in the perpendicular  stick, so that, by the aid of the small prop, the cross one could be  kept in any position for an indefinite time.    \"Look here, Jack!\" he cried, when he saw that I was awake. \"Come and  give me your opinion. Suppose I put this cross-stick pointing straight  at a thing, and arranged this small one so as to keep it so, and left  it, I could find that thing again if I wanted it--don't you think I  could, Jack--don't you think so?\" he continued, nervously, clutching me  by the arm.    \"Well,\" I answered, \"it would depend on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: CHARTER OF WILLIAM I TO THE CITIZENS OF LONDON.]                 CHARTER OF WILLIAM I TO THE CITIZENS OF LONDON.

London and the Kingdom    A HISTORY--DERIVED MAINLY FROM THE ARCHIVES AT GUILDHALL IN THE CUSTODY OF  THE CORPORATION OF THE CITY OF LONDON.    By REGINALD R. SHARPE, D.C.L.,  RECORDS CLERK IN THE OFFICE OF THE TOWN CLERK OF THE CITY OF LONDON;  EDITOR OF \"CALENDAR OF WILLS ENROLLED IN THE COURT OF HUSTING,\" ETC.    IN THREE VOLUMES.    VOL. I.    _PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE CORPORATION UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE LIBRARY  COMMITTEE._    London  LONGMANS, GREEN & Co.  AND NEW YORK: 15 EAST 16TH STREET.    1894            LONDON:  PRINTED BY BLADES, EAST & BLADES,  23, ABCHURCH LANE, E.C.            PREFACE.      Of the numerous works that have been written on London, by which I mean  more especially the City of London, few have been devoted to an adequate,  if indeed any, consideration of its political importance in the history of  the Kingdom. The history of the City is so many-sided that writers have to  be content with the study of some particular phase or some special epoch.  Thus we have those who have concentrated their efforts to evolving out of  the remote past the municipal organization of the City. Their task has  been to unfold the origin and institution of the Mayoralty and Shrievalty  of London, the division of the City into wards with Aldermen at their  head, the development of the various trade and craft guilds, and the  respective powers and duties of the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council,  and of the Livery of London assembled in their Common Hall. Others have  devoted themselves to the study of the ecclesiastical and monastic side of  the City's history--its Cathedral, its religious houses, and hundred and  more parish churches, which occupied so large an extent of the City's  area. The ecclesiastical importance of the City, however, is too often  ignored. \"We are prone,\" writes Bishop Stubbs, \"in examining into the  municipal and mercantile history of London, to forget that it was a very  great ecclesiastical centre.\" Others, again, have confined themselves to  depicting the every-day life of the City burgess, his social condition,  his commercial pursuits, his amusements; whilst others have been content  to perpetuate the memory of streets and houses long since lost to the eye,  and thus to keep alive an interest in scenes and places which otherwise  would be forgotten.    The political aspect of the City's history has rarely been touched by  writers, and yet its geographical position combined with the innate  courage and enterprise of its citizens served to give it no small  political power and no insignificant place in the history of the Kingdom.  This being the case, the Corporation resolved to fill the void, and in  view of the year 1889 being the 700th Anniversary of the Mayoralty of  London--according to popular tradition--instructed the Library Committee to  prepare a work showing \"the pre-eminent position occupied by the City of  London and the important function it exercised in the shaping and making  of England.\"    It is in accordance with these instructions that this and succeeding  volumes have been compiled. As the title of the work has been taken from a  chapter in Mr. Loftie's book on London (\"Historic Towns\" series, chap.  ix), so its main features are delineated in that chapter. \"It would be  interesting\"--writes Mr. Loftie--\"to go over all the recorded instances in  which the City of London interfered directly in the affairs of the  Kingdom. Such a survey would be the history of England as seen from the  windows of the Guildhall.\" No words could better describe the character of  the work now submitted to the public. It has been compiled mainly from the  City's own archives. The City has been allowed to tell its own story. If,  therefore, its pages should appear to be too much taken up with accounts  of loans advanced by the City to impecunious monarchs or with wearisome  repetition of calls for troops to be raised in the City for foreign  service, it is because the City's records of the day are chiefly if not  wholly concerned with these matters. If, on the other hand, an event which  may be rightly deemed of national importance be here omitted, it is  because the citizens were little affected thereby, and the City's records  are almost, if not altogether, silent on the subject.    The work does not affect to be a critical history so much as a _chronique  pour servir_, to which the historical student may have recourse in order  to learn what was the attitude taken up by the citizens of London at  important crises in the nation's history. He will there see how, in the  contest between Stephen and the Empress Matilda, the City of London held  as it were the balance; how it helped to overthrow the tyranny of  Longchamp, and to wrest from the reluctant John the Great Charter of our  liberties; how it was with men and money supplied by the City that Edward  III and Henry V were enabled to conquer France, and how in after years the  London trained bands raised the siege of Gloucester and turned the tide of  the Civil War in favour of Parliament. He will not fail to note the  significant fact that before Monk put into execution his plan for  restoring Charles II to the Crown, the taciturn general--little given to  opening his mind to anyone--deemed it advisable to take up his abode in the  City in order to first test the feelings of the inhabitants as to whether  the Restoration would be acceptable to them or not. He will see that the  citizens of London have at times been bold of speech even in the presence  of their sovereign when the cause of justice and the liberty of the  subject were at stake, and that they did not hesitate to suffer for their  opinions; that, \"at many of the most critical periods of our history, the  influence of London and its Lord Mayors has turned the scale in favour of  those liberties of which we are so justly proud\"; and that had the  entreaties of the City been listened to by the King and his ministers, the  American Colonies would never have been lost to England.    There are two Appendices to the work; one comprising copies from the  City's Records of letters, early proclamations and documents of special  interest to which reference is made in the text; the other consisting of a  more complete list of the City's representatives in Parliament from the  earliest times than has yet been printed, supplemented as it has been by  returns to writs recorded in the City's archives and (apparently) no where  else. The returns for the City in the Blue Books published in 1878 and  1879 are very imperfect.                                                                      R. R. S.
