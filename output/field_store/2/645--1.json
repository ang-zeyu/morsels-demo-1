A.          INTRODUCTION      Before the dawn of history mankind was engaged in the study of dreaming.  The wise man among the ancients was preeminently the interpreter of  dreams. The ability to interpret successfully or plausibly was the  quickest road to royal favor, as Joseph and Daniel found it to be;  failure to give satisfaction in this respect led to banishment from  court or death. When a scholar laboriously translates a cuneiform tablet  dug up from a Babylonian mound where it has lain buried for five  thousand years or more, the chances are that it will turn out either an  astrological treatise or a dream book. If the former, we look upon it  with some indulgence; if the latter with pure contempt. For we know that  the study of the stars, though undertaken for selfish reasons and  pursued in the spirit of charlatanry, led at length to physical science,  while the study of dreams has proved as unprofitable as the dreaming of  them. Out of astrology grew astronomy. Out of oneiromancy has  grown--nothing.    That at least was substantially true up to the beginning of the present  century. Dream books in all languages continued to sell in cheap  editions and the interpreters of dreams made a decent or, at any rate, a  comfortable living out of the poorer classes. But the psychologist  rarely paid attention to dreams except incidentally in his study of  imagery, association and the speed of thought. But now a change has come  over the spirit of the times. The subject of the significance of dreams,  so long ignored, has suddenly become a matter of energetic study and of  fiery controversy the world over.    The cause of this revival of interest is the new point of view brought  forward by Professor Bergson in the paper which is here made accessible  to the English-reading public. This is the idea that we can explore the  unconscious substratum of our mentality, the storehouse of our memories,  by means of dreams, for these memories are by no means inert, but have,  as it were, a life and purpose of their own, and strive to rise into  consciousness whenever they get a chance, even into the  semi-consciousness of a dream. To use Professor Bergson's striking  metaphor, our memories are packed away under pressure like steam in a  boiler and the dream is their escape valve.    That this is more than a mere metaphor has been proved by Professor  Freud and others of the Vienna school, who cure cases of hysteria by  inducing the patient to give expression to the secret anxieties and  emotions which, unknown to him, have been preying upon his mind. The  clue to these disturbing thoughts is generally obtained in dreams or  similar states of relaxed consciousness. According to the Freudians a  dream always means something, but never what it appears to mean. It is  symbolic and expresses desires or fears which we refuse ordinarily to  admit to consciousness, either because they are painful or because they  are repugnant to our moral nature. A watchman is stationed at the gate  of consciousness to keep them back, but sometimes these unwelcome  intruders slip past him in disguise. In the hands of fanatical Freudians  this theory has developed the wildest extravagancies, and the voluminous  literature of psycho-analysis contains much that seems to the layman  quite as absurd as the stuff which fills the twenty-five cent dream  book.    It is impossible to believe that the subconsciousness of every one of us  contains nothing but the foul and monstrous specimens which they dredge  up from the mental depths of their neuropathic patients and exhibit with  such pride.    Bergson's view seems to me truer as it is certainly more agreeable, that  we keep stored away somewhere all our memories, the good as well as the  evil, the pleasant together with the unpleasant. There may be nightmares  down cellar, as we thought as a child, but even in those days we knew  how to dodge them when we went after apples; that is, take down a light  and slam the door quickly on coming up.    Maeterlinck, too, knew this trick of our childhood. When in the Palace  of Night scene of his fairy play, the redoubtable Tyltyl unlocks the  cage where are confined the nightmares and all other evil imaginings, he  shuts the door in time to keep them in and then opens another revealing  a lovely garden full of blue birds, which, though they fade and die when  brought into the light of common day, yet encourage him to continue his  search for the Blue Bird that never fades, but lives everlastingly. The  new science of dreams is giving a deeper significance to the trite wish  of \"Good night and pleasant dreams!\" It means sweet sanity and mental  health, pure thoughts and good will to all men.    Professor Bergson's theory of dreaming here set forth in untechnical  language, fits into a particular niche in his general system of  philosophy as well as does his little book on _Laughter_. With the main  features of his philosophy the English-reading public is better  acquainted than with any other contemporary system, for his books have  sold even more rapidly here than in France. When Professor Bergson  visited the United States two years ago the lecture-rooms of Columbia  University, like those of the College de France, were packed to the  doors and the effect of his message was enhanced by his eloquence of  delivery and charm of personality. The pragmatic character of his  philosophy appeals to the genius of the American people as is shown by  the influence of the teaching of William James and John Dewey, whose  point of view in this respect resembles Bergson's.    During the present generation chemistry and biology have passed from the  descriptive to the creative stage. Man is becoming the overlord of the  mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. He is learning to make gems and  perfumes, drugs and foods, to suit his tastes, instead of depending upon  the chance bounty of nature. He is beginning consciously to adapt means  to ends and to plan for the future even in the field of politics. He has  opened up the atom and finds in it a microcosm more complex than the  solar system. He beholds the elements melting with fervent heat and he  turns their rays to the healing of his sores. He drives the lightning  through the air and with the product feeds his crops. He makes the  desert to blossom as the rose and out of the sea he draws forth dry  land. He treats the earth as his habitation, remodeling it in accordance  with his ever-varying needs and increasing ambitions.    This modern man, planning, contriving and making, finds Paley's watch as  little to his mind as Lucretius's blind flow of atoms. A universe wound  up once for all and doing nothing thereafter but mark time is as  incomprehensible to him as a universe that never had a mind of its own  and knows no difference between past and future. The idea of eternal  recurrence does not frighten him as it did Nietzsche, for he feels it to  be impossible. The mechanistic interpretation of natural phenomena  developed during the last century he accepts at its full value, and  would extend experimentally as far as it will go, for he finds it not  invalid but inadequate.    To minds of this temperament it is no wonder that Bergson's _Creative  Evolution_ came with the force of an inspiration. Men felt themselves  akin to this upward impulse, this _elan vital_, which, struggling  throughout the ages with the intractableness of inert matter, yet  finally in some way or other forces it to its will, and ever strives  toward the increase of vitality, mentality, personality.    Bergson has been reluctant to commit himself on the question of  immortality, but he of late has become quite convinced of it. He even  goes so far as to think it possible that we may find experimental  evidence of personal persistence after death. This at least we might  infer from his recent acceptance of the presidency of the British  Society for Psychical Research. In his opening address before the  Society, May 28, 1913, he discussed the question of telepathy and in  that connection he explained his theory of the relation of mind and  brain in the following language. I quote from the report in the London  _Times_:           The _role_ of the brain is to bring back the remembrance of an       action, to prolong the remembrance in movements. If one could see       all that takes place in the interior of the brain, one would find       that that which takes place there corresponds to a small part only       of the life of the mind. The brain simply extracts from the life of       the mind that which is capable of representation in movement. The       cerebral life is to the mental life what the movements of the baton       of a conductor are to the Symphony.         The brain, then, is that which allows the mind to adjust itself       exactly to circumstances. It is the organ of attention to life.       Should it become deranged, however slightly, the mind is no longer       fitted to the circumstances; it wanders, dreams. Many forms of       mental alienation are nothing else. But from this it results that       one of the _roles_ of the brain is to limit the vision of the       mind, to render its action more efficacious. This is what we       observe in regard to the memory, where the _role_ of the brain is       to mask the useless part of our past in order to allow only the       useful remembrances to appear. Certain useless recollections, or       dream remembrances, manage nevertheless to appear also, and to form    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original 379 illustrations.

The rough and ready methods common in American logging operations are  the result partly of a tradition of inexhaustible supply, partly of  the fear of fire and the avoidance of taxes, partly of an eagerness to  get rich quick. Most of the logging has been done on privately owned  land or on shamelessly stolen public land, and the lumberman had no  further interest in the forest than to lumber it expeditiously.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Making a Valuation Survey.]    [Illustration: Fig. 2. \"Blazes\" on Trees.]    Preliminary to the actual logging are certain necessary steps. First  of all is _landlooking_. This includes the survey of the forest land  for the purpose of locating good timber. Fig. 1. Most of the woodland  has previously been roughly surveyed by the government and maps made  indicating which parts are private land and which are still held  by the government. The boundaries of townships, sections, quarter  sections, eighties, forties, etc., are indicated by \"blazes\" on trees,  Fig. 2, so that the \"cruiser\""]]]
