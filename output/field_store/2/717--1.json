The old man smiled. \"I  speck 'twuz one time er two times, er maybe a time an' a half. You know  when Johnny Ashcake 'gun ter bake? Well, 'twuz 'long in dem days. Once  'pon a time,\" he resumed, \"Mr. Man had a gyarden so fine dat all de  neighbors come ter see it. Some 'ud look at it over de fence, some 'ud  peep thoo de cracks, an' some 'ud come an' look at it by de light er de  stars. An' one un um wuz ol' Brer Rabbit; starlight, moonlight,  cloudlight, de nightlight wuz de light fer him. When de turn er de  mornin' come, he 'uz allers up an' about, an' a-feelin' purty well I  thank you, suh!    [Illustration]    \"Now, den, you done hear what I say. Dar wuz Mr. Man, yander wuz de  gyarden, an' here wuz ol' Brer Rabbit.\" Uncle Remus made a map of this  part of the story by marking in the sand with his walking-cane. \"Well,  dis bein' de case, what you speck gwineter happen? Nothin' in de roun'  worl' but what been happenin' sence greens an' sparrer-grass wuz planted  in de groun'. Dey look fine an' dey tas'e fine, an' long to'rds de shank  er de mornin', Brer Rabbit 'ud creep thoo de crack er de fence an'  nibble at um. He'd take de greens, but leave his tracks, mo' speshually  right atter a rain. Takin' an' leavin'--it's de way er de worl'.    [Illustration]    \"Well, one mornin', Mr. Man went out in his truck patch, an' he fin'  sump'n missin'--a cabbage here, a turnip dar, an' a mess er beans  yander, an' he ax how come dis? He look 'roun', he did, an' he seed Brer  Rabbit's tracks what he couldn't take wid 'im. Brer Rabbit had lef' his  shoes at home, an' come bar'footed.    [Illustration]    \"So Mr. Man, he call his dogs 'Here, Buck! Here, Brinjer! Here, Blue!'  an' he sicc'd um on de track, an' here dey went!    [Illustration]    \"You'd 'a' thunk dey wuz runnin' atter forty-lev'm rhinossyhosses fum de  fuss dey made. Brer Rabbit he hear um comin' an' he put out fer home,  kinder doublin' 'roun' des like he do deze days.    [Illustration]    \"When he got ter de p'int whar he kin set down fer ter rest his face an'  han's, he tuck a poplar leaf an' 'gun ter fan hisse'f. Den Brer Fox come  a-trottin' up. He say, 'Brer Rabbit, what's all dis fuss I hear in de  woods? What de name er goodness do it mean?' Brer Rabbit kinder scratch  his head an' 'low, 'Why, deyer tryin' fer drive me ter de big bobbycue  on de creek. Dey all ax me, an' when I 'fuse dey say deyer gwine ter  make me go any how. Dey aint no fun in bein' ez populous ez what I is,  Brer Fox. Ef you wanter go, des git in ahead er de houn's an' go  lickity-split down de big road!'    [Illustration]    \"Brer Fox roll his little eyes, an' lick his chops whar he dribble at de  mouf, an put out ter de bobbycue, an' he aint mo' dan made his  disappearance, 'fo' here come Brer Wolf, an' when he got de news, off he  put.    \"An' he aint mo'n got out'n sight, 'fo' here come ol' Brer B'ar, an'  when he hear talk er de bakin' meat an' de big pan er gravy, he sot up  on his behime legs an' snored. Den off he put, an' he aint got out'n  hearin', 'fo' Brer Coon come rackin' up, an' when he got de news, he put  out.    [Illustration]    \"So dar dey wuz an' what you gwine do 'bout it? It seem like dey all got  in front er de dogs, er de dogs got behime um, an' Brer Rabbit sot by de  creek-side laughin' an' hittin' at de snake doctors. An' dem po'  creeturs had ter go clean past de bobbycue--ef dey wuz any bobbycue,  which I don't skacely speck dey wuz. Dat what make me say what I  does--when you git a invite ter a bobbycue, you better fin' out when an'  whar it's at, an' who runnin' it.\"          BRER RABBIT'S FROLIC      [Illustration]    The little boy, when he next saw Uncle Remus, after hearing how the  animals went to the barbecue, wanted to know what happened to them: he  was anxious to learn if any of them were hurt by the dogs that had been  chasing Brother Rabbit. The old darkey closed his eyes and chuckled.  \"You sho is axin' sump'n now, honey. Und' his hat, ef he had any, Brer  Rabbit had a mighty quick thinkin' apple-ratus, an' mos' inginner'lly,  all de time, de pranks he played on de yuther creeturs pestered um bofe  ways a-comin' an' a-gwine. De dogs done mighty well, 'long ez dey had  dealin's wid de small fry, like Brer Fox, an' Brer Coon, an' Brer Wolf,  but when dey run ag'in' ol' Brer B'ar, dey sho struck a snag. De mos'  servigrous wuz de identual one dat got de wust hurted. He got too close  ter Brer B'ar, an' when he look at hisse'f in runnin' water, he tuck  notice dat he wuz split wide open fum flank ter dewlap.    [Illustration]    \"Atter de rucus wuz over, de creeturs hobbled off home de best dey  could, an' laid 'roun' in sun an' shade fer ter let der cuts an' gashes  git good an' well. When dey got so dey could segashuate, an' pay der  party calls, dey 'gree fer ter insemble some'rs, an' hit on some plan  fer ter outdo Brer Rabbit. Well, dey had der insembly, an' dey jower'd  an' jower'd des like yo' pa do when he aint feelin' right well; but,  bimeby, dey 'greed 'pon a plan dat look like it mought work. Dey 'gree  fer ter make out dat dey gwine ter have a dance. Dey know'd dat ol' Brer  Rabbit wuz allers keen fer dat, an' dey say dey'll gi' him a invite, an'  when he got dar, dey'd ax 'im fer ter play de fiddle, an' ef he 'fuse,  dey'll close in on 'im an' make way wid 'im.    [Illustration]    \"So fur, so good! But all de time dey wuz jowerin' an' confabbin', ol'  Brer Rabbit wus settin' in a shady place in de grass, a-hearin' eve'y  word dey say. When de time come, he crope out, he did, an' run 'roun',  an' de fust news dey know'd, here he come down de big  road--bookity-bookity--same ez a hoss dat's broke thoo de pastur' fence.  He say, sezee, 'Why, hello, frien's! an' howdy, too, kaze I aint seed  you-all sence de last time! Whar de name er goodness is you been deze  odd-come-shorts? an' how did you far' at de bobbycue? Ef my two eyeballs  aint gone an' got crooked, dar's ol' Brer B'ar, him er de short tail an'  sharp tush--de ve'y one I'm a-huntin' fer! An' dar's Brer Coon! I sho is  in big luck. Dar's gwineter be a big frolic at Miss Meadows', an' her  an' de gals want Brer B'ar fer ter show um de roas'n'-y'ar shuffle; an'  dey put Brer Coon down fer de jig dey calls rack-back-Davy.    [Illustration]    \"'I'm ter play de fiddle--sump'n I aint done sence my oldest gal had de  mumps an' de measles, bofe de same day an' hour! Well, dis mornin' I  tuck down de fiddle fum whar she wuz a-hangin' at, an' draw'd de bow  backerds an' forerds a time er two, an' den I shot my eyes an' hit some  er de ol'-time chunes, an' when I come ter myse'f, dar wuz my whole  blessed fambly skippin' an' sasshayin' 'roun' de room, spite er de fack  dat brekkus wuz ter be cooked!'    [Illustration]    \"Wid dat, Brer Rabbit bow'd, he did, an' went back down de road like de  dogs wuz atter 'im.\"    [Illustration]    \"But what happened then?\" the little boy asked. \"Nothin' 't all,\"  replied Uncle Remus, taking up the chuckle where he had left off. \"De  creeturs aint had no dance, an' when dey went ter Miss Meadows', she put  her head out de winder, an' say ef dey don't go off fum dar she'll have  de law on um!\"          BROTHER BEAR'S BIG HOUSE      [Illustration]    \"Uv all de creeturs\", said Uncle Remus, in response to a questioning  took on the part of the little boy, \"ol Brer B'ar had de biggest an' de  warmest house. I dunner why ner wharfo', but I'm a-tellin' you de plain  fack, des ez dey to!' it unter me. Ef I kin he'p it I never will be  deceivin' you, ner lead you inter no bad habits. Yo' pappy trotted wid  me a mighty long time, an' ef you'll ax him he'll tell you dat de one  thing I never did do wuz ter deceive him whiles he had his eyes open;  not ef I knows myse'f. Well, ol' Brer B'ar had de big house I'm  a-tellin' you about. Ef he y'ever is brag un it, it aint never come down  ter me. Yit dat's des what he had--a big house an' plenty er room fer  him an' his fambly; an' he aint had mo' dan he need, kaze all er his  fambly wuz fat an' had what folks calls heft--de nachal plunkness.    [Illustration]    \"He had a son name Simmon, an' a gal name Sue, not countin' his ol'  'oman, an' dey all live wid one an'er day atter day, an' night atter  night; an' when one un um went abroad, dey'd be spected home 'bout  meal-time, ef not befo', an' dey segashuated right along fum day ter  day, washin' der face an' han's in de same wash-pan in de back po'ch,  an' wipin' on de same towel same ez all happy famblies allers does.

Brer B'ar holla out, he did, 'Don't  t'ar down my house! Who is you, anyhow, an' what you want?' An' de  answer come, 'I'm one an' darfo' not two; ef youer mo' dan one, who is  you an' what you doin' in dar?' Brer B'ar, he say, sezee, 'I'm all er  one an' mighty nigh two, but I'd thank you fer ter tell me yo' full  fambly name.' Den de answer come.

The young men of which this  second group was composed represented the various newspapers of New York  City, and while a \"beat\" was evidently impossible, each of them was  determined to get a line for his own journal from the returning hero,  Dr. John Earl, which he would not share with the others of the  fraternity, and several of them held anxious consultations with their  photographers who, by special permit, had been allowed upon the pier.    The other group had moved a number of times to escape the cameras, and a  red-haired youth was expatiating upon the glories of American scientific  achievement, concluding with a peroration that called forth an  exclamation from one of the older men:    \"Oh, shut up, Bedford; you sound like a Fourth of July oration. Who are  the people you are trying to snapshot for your lurid sheet?\" he said  wearily, as becomes a Chicago newspaper man when in New York.    The red-headed one looked at him with cheerful surprise. \"Don't you know  anybody?\" he asked. \"The tall, handsome blonde is Mrs. Ramsey, wife of  George Ramsey, at whose frown the great gods sit tight and the little  ones scuttle to cover. Luckily, he is a kindly disposed arbiter and the  Street basks under his smile.\"    The Chicagoan turned and looked at the lady curiously, and the reporter  went on: \"The fair-haired lady with the wild-rose face is old Gordon  Kimball's daughter; born with a diamond teething ring in her mouth, but  has never succeeded in getting anything else of value inside her pretty  head.\"    \"Well, she doesn't have to,\" said the Westerner.    Young Bedford grinned. \"That's what Dr. Earl thinks; he can furnish  brains for the family. Their engagement was reported two months ago. The  man with them is Earl's brother, Frank Earl, corporation lawyer, amateur  actor, one of those guys that does everything well, and never gives away  his own hand. Go after him for a story about some combination his road  has gone into and you come away with a great spiel about bumper crops;  always gives you the glad hand, but nothing in it. You'd never take him  for Mrs. Ramsey's brother, would you? She's a looker, all right. So is  Dr. Earl, one of these big, handsome, powerful-looking men that makes  folks ask who he is.\"    \"What's all the hullabaloo about, anyhow?\" asked the Chicago man.    \"Where have you been that you don't know about Earl?\" answered Bedford.  \"Why, I thought everybody in the country had heard of him. He's the chap  that raises the dead, you know; just takes 'em by the hand, makes a few  passes, and says, 'Say, it's time to wake up, old fellow,' and the dead  one sits up and asks for beefsteak. He's the man that saved Hall, the  copper mines king, over in Paris. Hall was finished, all done but  putting him in a box, when in comes Dr. Earl. 'Let him alone,' he says.  'He's tired out. When he finishes this nap he'll be just as good as  new.' But you know how impetuous the French are, and they were going to  have poor old Hall done for, sure enough, when this Earl man stands them  off, and promises to bring Hall 'round in six hours. And he does it  after the whole bunch of them have parleyed over him and waved  looking-glasses across his mouth, and found him as dead as Rameses.\"    There was a general buzz among the newspaper men, and one of them, older  and more dignified in manner than the others, said quietly, \"Bedford,  you ought not to hand out that kind of fiction, even in your unreliable  journal.\"    Bedford winked slyly at the Chicagoan. \"It was my only hope,\" he said in  a rapid aside. \"That's Tourney. He was over there at the time, and he'll  tell us all about it trying to put me right.\"    \"If you don't like my story you can give us the straight steer yourself,  Tourney,\" he said, and, nothing loath, the older man told how Hall had  been suddenly stricken with appendicitis in such severe form that an  operation was necessary at once. Upon this the French surgeons agreed,  but his heart action was so bad that they dared not administer an  anaesthetic, and one of them, who was a noted hypnotist, expressed a  doubt whether he would be able to rouse the patient from a hypnosis  sufficiently profound to enable them to perform the operation.    \"This Frenchman,\" Tourney went on, warming to his subject, \"had seen  Earl do some wonderful things and he knew he was in Paris and where he  was stopping. He put the case to Hall, and seeing that it was all day  with him unless something was done, he told them to send for Earl and  they got him there on the double-quick. I was waiting in the hall when  he went into the operating room and I stayed there until he came out,  and as I had done him one or two good turns he told me about it before  he realized that I was a newspaper man. When he saw me last I was  coaching Harvard students with more money than brains. That has nothing  to do with it, except to show that he isn't one of these 'for  publication only' wonder workers.\"    \"Hurry up,\" said the Chicagoan, \"he'll be here in a few minutes, and if  he's one of these human clams you are the hope of the press. What did he  tell you?\"    \"He agreed with the others in the main points, but he said if Hall was  willing to take the chance, he believed he could pull him through by a  system he had seen used in India. Then he cleared them all out, and when  they came back Hall was comatose. The appendix was removed in record  time, and the wound cleansed. Just before Earl finished, one of the  Frenchmen noticed that the patient was not breathing, apparently, and  exclaimed that he was dead. Dr. Earl pointed out the fact that the blood  showed no signs of other than a normal condition, such as would be found  in a patient under hypnosis. His idea, as I got it, was that the patient  must be kept unconscious long enough for the body to regain its  functions and get over the strain of the operation. He told them if he  were more familiar with Hall's constitution, he would be inclined to  prolong his condition of suspended animation, but under the  circumstances he would restore him to consciousness in three hours.    \"One or two of them got excited and swore the man was dead, and  according to a lot of tests he was, but the rest, knowing he would have  died anyhow, were willing to wait, and at the end of the time Earl  brought him back to consciousness in such good condition that the other  doctors were wild over it. In their enthusiastic French way they  heralded the story everywhere. I thought he'd never be allowed to leave  Paris. They wanted to keep him right there and string medals around his  neck and pin ribbons all over his coat, but he wouldn't"]]]
