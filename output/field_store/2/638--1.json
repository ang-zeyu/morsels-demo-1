A FIELD BOOK    OF    THE STARS        BY    WILLIAM TYLER OLCOTT      _Second Edition, revised and enlarged_      WITH FIFTY DIAGRAMS          G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS    NEW YORK AND LONDON    The Knickerbocker Press      COPYRIGHT, 1907    BY    WILLIAM TYLER OLCOTT    COPYRIGHT, 1914    BY    WILLIAM TYLER OLCOTT    (For Second Edition)    [Illustration: The Knickerbocker Press, New York]    _Printed in the United States of America_          INTRODUCTION.      Considering the ease with which a knowledge of the constellations can  be acquired, it seems a remarkable fact that so few are conversant  with these time-honored configurations of the heavens. Aside from a  knowledge of \"the Dipper\" and \"the Pleiades,\" the constellations to  the vast majority, are utterly unknown.    To facilitate and popularize if possible this fascinating recreation  of star-gazing the author has designed this field-book. It is limited  in scope solely to that purpose, and all matter of a technical or  theoretical nature has been omitted.    The endeavor has been to include in these pages only such matter as  the reader can observe with the naked eye, or an opera-glass.  Simplicity and brevity have been aimed at, the main idea being that  whatever is bulky or verbose is a hindrance rather than a help when  actually engaged in the observation of the heavens.    The constellations embraced in this manual are only those visible from  the average latitude of the New England and Middle States, and owe  their place in the particular season in which they are found to the  fact that in that season they are favorably situated for observation.    With this brief explanatory note of the purpose and design of the  book, the author proceeds to outline the scheme of study.          SCHEME OF STUDY.      The table of contents shows the scheme of study to be pursued, and to  facilitate the work it is desirable that the student follow the  therein circumscribed order.    A knowledge on the part of the reader of Ursa Major, or \"the Dipper\"  as it is commonly called, and \"the Pleiades,\" the well-known group in  Taurus, is presupposed by the author.    With this knowledge as a basis, the student is enabled in any season  to take up the study of the constellations. By following out the order  dictated, he will in a few nights of observation be enabled to  identify the various configurations making up the several  constellations that are set apart for study in that particular season.    A large plate, showing the appearance of the heavens at a designated  time on the first night of the quarter, is inserted before each  season's work. This should be consulted by the student before he makes  an observation, in order that he may obtain a comprehensive idea of  the relative position of the constellations, and also know in what  part of the heavens to locate the constellation which he wishes to  identify.    A knowledge of one constellation enables the student to determine the  position of the next in order. In this work, the identification of  each constellation depends on a knowledge of what precedes, always  bearing in mind the fact that each season starts as a new and distinct  part to be taken by itself, and has no bearing on that which comes  before.
