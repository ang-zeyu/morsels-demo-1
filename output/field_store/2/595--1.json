MARSHAL SOULT, DUKE OF DALMATIA.      On the preceding page is a portrait, and under the head of Recent Deaths,  in another part of this magazine, is a sketch of the history of NICHOLAS  JEAN-DE-DIEU SOULT, the last of the great Marshals created by the Emperor  Napoleon. He was unquestionably possessed of extraordinary abilities,  fitting him for eminence in many and diverse capacities, but it cannot be  said that he was of the first rank of illustrious generals, as the world  has been led to suppose, chiefly by the masterly but partial delineations  of his career in the Peninsula by General Napier. He had a genius for war  which qualified him for every position in connection with it but that of  leader in the field. The subtle and irreversible decisions of Napoleon  followed his astonishingly quick apprehensions of facts, as suddenly as  the thunderbolt follows lightning; but Soult, profoundly familiar with all  the arts of war, and surpassing any of the great commanders with whom he  was associated except only his chief, in the wisdom of his judgments, was  yet so slow in his intellectual operations, so destitute of the  enthusiasm, passion, and fire, which in high circumstance give an almost  miraculous activity to the minds of the first order of men, that he could  never have entitled himself to all the precedences he has received in  history. Napoleon understood him, and in a few pregnant words addressed to  O'Meara, gave that measure of his character which will be adopted as the  final opinion of the world. \"He is,\" said Napoleon, \"an excellent minister  at war, or major-general of an army, one who knows much better how to  manage an army than to command in chief.\"    The course of Soult as a citizen, a legislator, and a minister, was not  one upon which his best biographers will linger with much satisfaction.  The glory he had achieved as one of the lieutenants of Napoleon, in that  turbulent and grand career which has no parallel for interest or  importance in human history, was his only claim to distinction in  politics. His master had an ambition as fair in its proportions as it was  vast in its extent, and brought to every purpose the same forces of  character and preternatural energy of intelligence; but Soult had no love  for civil duties, but little capacity for them, and he accepted place as a  gratification of vanity or a means of success in mercenary aims. We see in  all his private and political life \"the soilure of his revolutionary  origin,\"--proofs that he loved money and power far more than he loved  honor, and himself far more than his country or mankind.    The last of the imperial marshals, the last of that gigantic race who  filled the world with a red glory like the gloom which will precede the  judgment, closed his stormy life peacefully in the place where he was  born, and thence was borne to the Invalides, to \"sleep well\" with his old  companions.\"            THE HOMES OF COWLEY AND FOX.      We have in the last _Art Journal_ another of the pleasant gossipping  _Pilgrimages to English Shrines_, by Mrs. S. C. HALL, and the following  abridgement of it will please all who have perused the previous papers of  the series. In Chertsey and its neighborhood are memorials of some of the  noblest men of England.                         [Illustration: ABRAHAM COWLEY.]                                 ABRAHAM COWLEY.            CHERTSEY AND ITS FAMOUS CHARACTERS.      The county of Surrey is rich to overflowing in memories, both of persons  and events, and the little quaint and quiet town of Chertsey could tell of  the gorgeous and gloomy past as much as many of its ancient neighbors  within a day's drive of the city. Had its old abbey stones but tongues,  how they could discourse of years when a visit to Chertsey was an  undertaking; though now the distance is but half an hour.    Nowhere within twenty miles of London does the Thames appear more queenly,  or sweep with greater grace through its fertile dominions, than it does at  Chertsey. It is, indeed, delightful to stand on the bridge in the glowing  sunset of a summer evening, and turning from the refreshing green of the  Shepperton Range, look into the deep clear blue of the flowing river,  while the murmur of the waters rushing through Laleham Lock give a sort of  spirit music to the scene. On the right, as you leave Chertsey, the river  bends gracefully towards the double bridge of Walton, and to the left, it  undulates smoothly along, having passed Runnymede and Staines, while the  almost conical hill of St. Anne's attracts attention by its abrupt and  singular form when viewed from the vale of the Thames.    About a mile, on the Walton side, from our favorite bridge (Old Camden  tells us so), is the spot where Caesar crossed the Thames. Were the  peasantry as imaginative as their brethren of Killarney, what legends  would have grown out of this tradition; how often would the \"noblest Roman  of them all\" have been seen by the pale moonlight leading his steed over  the waters of the rapid river--how many would have heard Cassivelaunus  himself during the stillness of some particular Midsummer night working at  the rude defence which can still be traced beneath the blue waters of the  Thames. What hosts of pale and ghastly spectres would have risen from  those tranquil banks, and from the deepest hollows of the rushing current,  and--like the Huns, who almost live on the inspired canvas of  Kaulbach,--fought their last earthly battle, again and again, in the spirit  world, amid the stars! But ours is no region of romance; even remnants of  history, which go beyond the commonest capacity, are rejected as dreams,  or put aside as legends. But history has enough to tell to interest us  all; and we may be satisfied with the abundant enjoyment we have in  delicious rambles through the lanes and up the hills, along the fair  river's banks, and among the many traditional ruins of ancient and  beautiful Surrey.    Never was desolation more complete than in the ruin of the Mitred Abbey of  Chertsey; hardly one stone remains above another to tell where this  stately edifice--since the far-away year 664--grew and flourished, lording  it with imperial sway over, not only the surrounding villages, but  extending its paternal wings into Middlesex and even as far as London. The  abbey was of the Benedictine order, and founded, almost as soon as the  Saxons were converted from Paganism; but it was finished and chiefly  endowed by Frithwald, Earl of Surrey. The endowment prospered rarely; the  establishment increased in the reputation of wealth and sanctity; that it  was \"thickly populated\" is certain, for when the abbey was sacked and  burnt by the Danes, in the ninth century, the abbot, and ninety monks,  were barbarously murdered by the invaders.    Standing upon the site of their now obliterated cloisters and towers,  their aisles and dormitories, cells and confessionals, seeing nothing but  the dank, damp grass, and the tracings of the fish-ponds--stagnant pools in  our day--it is almost impossible to realize the onslaught of these wild  barbarians panting for plunder, the earnest defence of men who fought (the  monks of old could wield either sword or crosier) for life or death, the  terrible destruction, the treasures and relics, and painted glass, and  monuments, the plunder of the secret almerys, the intoxicated triumph of  those rude northern hordes let loose in our fair and lovely island; what  scenes of savagery, where now the jackdaw builds, and the blackbird  whistles, and the wild water-rat plays with her brood amongst the tangled  weeds!    The fierce sea-kings being driven back to their frozen land, King Edgar,  willing to serve God after the fashion of his times, refounded the Abbey  of Chertsey, dedicating it to St. Peter, and vying with Pope Alexander in  augmenting its privileges and its wealth.    Some of the abbots took great interest in home improvements, planting  woods, conducting streams, enlarging ponds--building, now a mill, now a  dove-cot, according to the wants of the abbey or their own fancies. Henry  I. granted them permission to keep dogs, that, according to the old  chronicle, they might take \"hare, fox, and cats.\" King John, in the first  year of his reign, gave them ample confirmation of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20112"],[0,"Lill's Travels in Santa Claus Land (#1)"],[1,"LILL'S TRAVELS                      IN SANTA CLAUS LAND.

LILL'S TRAVELS IN SANTA CLAUS LAND.      Effie had been playing with her dolls one cold December morning, and  Lill had been reading, until both were tired. But it stormed too hard to  go out, and, as Mrs. Pelerine had said they need not do anything for two  hours, their little jaws might have been dislocated by yawning before  they would as much as pick up a pin. Presently Lill said, \"Effie, shall  I tell you a story.\"    \"O yes! do!\" said Effie, and she climbed up by Lill in the large  rocking-chair in front of the grate. She kept very still, for she knew  Lill's stories were not to be interrupted by a sound, or even a motion.  The first thing Lill did was to fix her eyes on the fire, and rock  backward and forward quite hard for a little while, and then she said,  \"Now I am going to tell you about my _thought travels_, and they are apt  to be a little queerer, but O! ever so much nicer, than the other kind!\"    As Lill's stories usually had a formal introduction she began: \"Once  upon a time, when I was taking a walk through the great field beyond the  orchard, I went way on, 'round where the path turns behind the hill. And  after I had walked a little way, I came to a high wall--built right up  into the sky. At first I thought I had discovered the 'ends of the  earth,' or perhaps I had somehow come to the great wall of China. But  after walking a long way I came to a large gate, and over it was printed  in beautiful gold letters, 'Santa Claus Land,' and the letters were  large enough for a baby to read!\"    How large that might be Lill did not stop to explain.    \"But the gate was shut tight,\" she continued, \"and though I knocked and  knocked and knocked, as hard as I could, nobody came to open it. I was  dreadfully disappointed, because I felt as if Santa Claus must live here  all of the year except when he went out to pay Christmas visits, and  it would be so lovely to see him in his own home, you know. But what was  I to do? The gate was entirely too high to climb over, and there wasn't  even a crack to peek through!\"    Here Lill paused, and Effie drew a long breath, and looked greatly  disappointed. Then Lill went on:    \"But you see, as I was poking about, I pressed a bell-spring, and in a  moment--jingle, jingle, jingle, the bells went ringing far and near,  with such a merry sound as was never heard before. While they were still  ringing the gate slowly opened and I walked in. I didn't even stop to  inquire if Santa Claus was at home, for I forgot all about myself and my  manners, it was so lovely. First there was a small paved square like a  court; it was surrounded by rows and rows of dark green trees, with  several avenues opening between them.    \"In the centre of the court was a beautiful marble fountain, with  streams of sugar plums and bon-bons tumbling out of it. Funny-looking  little men were filling cornucopias at the fountain, and pretty little  barefoot children, with chubby hands and dimpled shoulders, took them as  soon as they were filled, and ran off with them. They were all too much  occupied to speak to me, but as I came up to the fountain one of the  funny little fellows gave me a cornucopia, and I marched on with the  babies.    \"We went down one of the avenues, which would have been very dark only  it was splendidly lighted up with Christmas candles. I saw the babies  were slyly eating a candy or two, so I tasted mine, and they were  delicious--the real Christmas kind. After we had gone a little way, the  trees were smaller and not so close together, and here there were other  funny little fellows who were climbing up on ladders and tying toys and  bon-bons to the trees. The children stopped and delivered their  packages, but I walked on, for there was something in the distance that  I was curious to see. I could see that it was a large garden, that  looked as if it might be well cared for, and had many things growing in  it. But even in the distance it didn't look natural, and when I reached  it I found it was a very uncommon kind of a garden indeed. I could  scarcely believe my eyes, but there were dolls and donkeys and drays and  cars and croquet coming up in long, straight rows, and ever so many  other things beside. In one place the wooden dolls had only just  started; their funny little heads were just above ground, and I thought  they looked very much surprised at their surroundings. Farther on were  china dolls, that looked quite grown up, and I suppose were ready to  pull; and a gardener was hoeing a row of soldiers that didn't look in a  very healthy condition, or as if they had done very well.    \"The gardener looked familiar, I thought, and as I approached him he  stopped work and, leaning on his hoe he said, 'How do you do, Lilian? I  am very glad to see you.'    \"The moment he raised his face I knew it was Santa Claus, for he looked  exactly like the portrait we have of him. You can easily believe I was  glad then! I ran and put both of my hands in his, fairly shouting that I  was so glad to find him.    \"He laughed and said:    \"'Why, I am generally to be found here or hereabouts, for I work in the  grounds every day.'    \"And I laughed too, because his laugh sounded so funny; like the brook  going over stones, and the wind up in the trees. Two or three times,  when I thought he had done he would burst out again, laughing the vowels  in this way: 'Ha, ha, ha, ha! He, he, he, he, he! Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!  Ho, ho, ho, h-o-oo!'\"    Lill did it very well, and Effie laughed till the tears came to her  eyes; and she could quite believe Lill when she said, \"It grew to be so  funny that I couldn't stand, but fell over into one of the little chairs  that were growing in a bed just beyond the soldiers.    \"When Santa Claus saw that he stopped suddenly, saying:    \"'There, that will do. I take a hearty laugh every day, for the sake of  digestion.'    \"Then he added, in a whisper, 'That is the reason I live so long and  don't grow old. I've been the same age ever since the chroniclers began  to take notes, and those who are best able to judge think I'll continue  to be this way for about one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six  years longer,--they probably took a new observation at the Centennial,  and they know exactly.'    \"I was greatly delighted to hear this, and I told him so. He nodded and  winked and said it was 'all right,' and then asked if I'd like to see  the place. I said I would, so he threw down the hoe with a sigh, saying,  'I don't believe I shall have more than half a crop of soldiers this  season. They came up well, but the arms and legs seem to be weak. When I  get to town I'll have to send out some girls with glue pots, to stick  them fast.'    \"The town was at some distance, and our path took us by flower-beds  where some exquisite little toys were growing, and a hot-bed where new  varieties were being prop--_propagated_. Pretty soon we came to a  plantation of young trees, with rattles, and rubber balls, and ivory  rings growing on the branches, and as we went past they rang and bounded  about in the merriest sort of a way.    \"'There's a nice growth,' said Santa Claus, and it _was_ a nice growth  for babies; but just beyond I saw something so perfectly splendid that I  didn't care about the plantation.\"    \"Well,\" said Lill impressively, seeing that Effie was sufficiently  expectant, \"It was a lovely grove. The trees were large, with long  drooping branches, and the branches were just loaded with dolls'  clothes. There were elegant silk dresses, with lovely sashes of every  color--\"    Just here Effie couldn't help saying \"O!\" for she had a weakness for  sashes. Lill looked stern, and put a warning hand over her mouth, and  went on.    \"There was everything that the most fashionable doll could want, growing  in the greatest profusion. Some of the clothes had fallen, and there  were funny-looking girls picking them up, and packing them in trunks and  boxes. 'These are all ripe,' said Santa Claus, stopping to shake a tree,  and the clothes came tumbling down so fast that the workers were busier  than ever. The grove was on a hill, so that we had a beautiful view of  the country. First there was a park filled with reindeer, and beyond  that was the town, and at one side a large farm-yard filled with  animals of all sorts.    \"But as Santa Claus seemed in a hurry I did not stop long to look. Our  path led through the park, and we stopped to call 'Prancer' and 'Dancer'  and 'Donder' and 'Blitzen,' and Santa Claus fed them with lumps of sugar  from his pocket. He pointed out 'Comet' and 'Cupid' in a distant part of  the park; 'Dasher' and 'Vixen' were nowhere to be seen.    \"Here I found most of the houses were Swiss cottages, but there were  some fine churches and public buildings, all of beautifully illustrated  building blocks, and we stopped for a moment at a long depot, in which a  locomotive was just _smashing up_.    \"Santa Claus' house stood in the middle of the town. It was an  old-fashioned looking house, very broad and low, with an enormous  chimney. There was a wide step in front of the door, shaded by a  fig-tree and grape-vine, and morning-glories and scarlet beans clambered  by the side of the latticed windows; and there were great round  rose-bushes, with great, round roses, on either side of the walk leading  to the door.\"    \"O! it must have smelled like a party,\" said Effie, and then subsided,  as she remembered that she was interrupting.    \"Inside, the house was just cozy and comfortable, a real"]]]
