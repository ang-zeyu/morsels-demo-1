And the Whig as a wit never expressed his political point more  clearly than in Pope's line which ran: \"The right divine of kings to  govern wrong.\" It will be apparent, when I deal with that period, that I  do not palliate the real unreason in divine right as Filmer and some of  the pedantic cavaliers construed it. They professed the impossible ideal  of \"non-resistance\" to any national and legitimate power; though I  cannot see that even that was so servile and superstitious as the more  modern ideal of \"non-resistance\" even to a foreign and lawless power.  But the seventeenth century was an age of sects, that is of fads; and  the Filmerites made a fad of divine right. Its roots were older, equally  religious but much more realistic; and though tangled with many other  and even opposite things of the Middle Ages, ramify through all the  changes we have now to consider. The connection can hardly be stated  better than by taking Pope's easy epigram and pointing out that it is,  after all, very weak in philosophy. \"The right divine of kings to  govern wrong,\" considered as a sneer, really evades all that we mean by  \"a right.\" To have a right to do a thing is not at all the same as to be  right in doing it. What Pope says satirically about a divine right is  what we all say quite seriously about a human right. If a man has a  right to vote, has he not a right to vote wrong? If a man has a right to  choose his wife, has he not a right to choose wrong? I have a right to  express the opinion which I am now setting down; but I should hesitate  to make the controversial claim that this proves the opinion to be  right.    Now mediaeval monarchy, though only one aspect of mediaeval rule, was  roughly represented in the idea that the ruler had a right to rule as a  voter has a right to vote. He might govern wrong, but unless he governed  horribly and extravagantly wrong, he retained his position of right; as  a private man retains his right to marriage and locomotion unless he  goes horribly and extravagantly off his head. It was not really even so  simple as this; for the Middle Ages were not, as it is often the fashion  to fancy, under a single and steely discipline. They were very  controversial and therefore very complex; and it is easy, by isolating  items whether about _jus divinum_ or _primus inter pares_, to maintain  that the mediaevals were almost anything; it has been seriously  maintained that they were all Germans. But it is true that the influence  of the Church, though by no means of all the great churchmen,  encouraged the sense of a sort of sacrament of government, which was  meant to make the monarch terrible and therefore often made the man  tyrannical. The disadvantage of such despotism is obvious enough. The  precise nature of its advantage must be better understood than it is,  not for its own sake so much as for the story we have now to tell.    The advantage of \"divine right,\" or irremovable legitimacy, is this;  that there is a limit to the ambitions of the rich. \"_Roi ne puis_\"; the  royal power, whether it was or was not the power of heaven, was in one  respect like the power of heaven. It was not for sale. Constitutional  moralists have often implied that a tyrant and a rabble have the same  vices. It has perhaps been less noticed that a tyrant and a rabble most  emphatically have the same virtues. And one virtue which they very  markedly share is that neither tyrants nor rabbles are snobs; they do  not care a button what they do to wealthy people. It is true that  tyranny was sometimes treated as coming from the heavens almost in the  lesser and more literal sense of coming from the sky; a man no more  expected to be the king than to be the west wind or the morning star.  But at least no wicked miller can chain the wind to turn only his own  mill; no pedantic scholar can trim the morning star to be his own  reading-lamp. Yet something very like this is what really happened to  England in the later Middle Ages; and the first sign of it, I fancy, was  the fall of Richard II.    Shakespeare's historical plays are something truer than historical;  they are traditional; the living memory of many things lingered, though  the memory of others was lost. He is right in making Richard II.  incarnate the claim to divine right; and Bolingbroke the baronial  ambition which ultimately broke up the old mediaeval order. But divine  right had become at once drier and more fantastic by the time of the  Tudors. Shakespeare could not recover the fresh and popular part of the  thing; for he came at a later stage in a process of stiffening which is  the main thing to be studied in later mediaevalism. Richard himself was  possibly a wayward and exasperating prince; it might well be the weak  link that snapped in the strong chain of the Plantagenets. There may  have been a real case against the _coup d'etat_ which he effected in  1397, and his kinsman Henry of Bolingbroke may have had strong sections  of disappointed opinion on his side when he effected in 1399 the first  true usurpation in English history. But if we wish to understand that  larger tradition which even Shakespeare had lost, we must glance back at  something which befell Richard even in the first years of his reign. It  was certainly the greatest event of his reign; and it was possibly the  greatest event of all the reigns which are rapidly considered in this  book. The real English people, the men who work with their hands, lifted  their hands to strike their masters, probably for the first and  certainly for the last time in history.    Pagan slavery had slowly perished, not so much by decaying as by  developing into something better. In one sense it did not die, but  rather came to life. The slave-owner was like a man who should set up a  row of sticks for a fence, and then find they had struck root and were  budding into small trees. They would be at once more valuable and less  manageable, especially less portable; and such a difference between a  stick and a tree was precisely the difference between a slave and a  serf--or even the free peasant which the serf seemed rapidly tending to  become. It was, in the best sense of a battered phrase, a social  evolution, and it had the great evil of one. The evil was that while it  was essentially orderly, it was still literally lawless. That is, the  emancipation of the commons had already advanced very far, but it had  not yet advanced far enough to be embodied in a law. The custom was  \"unwritten,\" like the British Constitution, and (like that evolutionary,  not to say evasive entity) could always be overridden by the rich, who  now drive their great coaches through Acts of Parliament. The new  peasant was still legally a slave, and was to learn it by one of those  turns of fortune which confound a foolish faith in the common sense of  unwritten constitutions. The French Wars gradually grew to be almost as  much of a scourge to England as they were to France. England was  despoiled by her own victories; luxury and poverty increased at the  extremes of society; and, by a process more proper to an ensuing  chapter, the balance of the better mediaevalism was lost. Finally, a  furious plague, called the Black Death, burst like a blast on the land,  thinning the population and throwing the work of the world into ruin.  There was a shortage of labour; a difficulty of getting luxuries; and  the great lords did what one would expect them to do. They became  lawyers, and upholders of the letter of the law. They appealed to a rule  already nearly obsolete, to drive the serf back to the more direct  servitude of the Dark Ages. They announced their decision to the people,  and the people rose in arms.    The two dramatic stories which connect Wat Tyler, doubtfully with the  beginning, and definitely with the end of the revolt, are far from  unimportant, despite the desire of our present prosaic historians to  pretend that all dramatic stories are unimportant. The tale of Tyler's  first blow is significant in the sense that it is not only dramatic but  domestic. It avenged an insult to the family, and made the legend of the  whole riot, whatever its incidental indecencies, a sort of demonstration  on behalf of decency. This is important; for the dignity of the poor is  almost unmeaning in modern debates; and an inspector need only bring a  printed form and a few long words to do the same thing without having  his head broken. The occasion of the protest, and the form which the  feudal reaction had first taken, was a Poll Tax; but this was but a  part of a general process of pressing the population to servile labour,  which fully explains the ferocious language held by the government after  the rising had failed; the language in which it threatened to make the  state of the serf more servile than before. The facts attending the  failure in question are less in dispute. The mediaeval populace showed  considerable military energy and co-operation, stormed its way to  London, and was met outside the city by a company containing the King  and the Lord Mayor, who were forced to consent to a parley. The  treacherous stabbing of Tyler by the Mayor gave the signal for battle  and massacre on the spot. The peasants closed in roaring, \"They have  killed our leader\"; when a strange thing happened; something which gives  us a fleeting and a final glimpse of the crowned sacramental man of the  Middle Ages. For one wild moment divine right was divine.    The King was no more than a boy; his very voice must have rung out to  that multitude almost like the voice of a child. But the power of his  fathers and the great Christendom from which he came fell in some  strange fashion upon him; and riding out alone before the people, he  cried out, \"I am your leader\"; and himself promised to grant them all  they asked.

God knows  I never wished to harass him, but I felt that merely, at this, to turn  my back on him was to abandon or, to put it more truly, to lose him.  \"I've just begun a letter to your uncle,\" I said.    \"Well, then, finish it!\"    I waited a minute. \"What happened before?\"    He gazed up at me again. \"Before what?\"    \"Before you came back. And before you went away.\"    For some time he was silent, but he continued to meet my eyes. \"What  happened?\"    It made me, the sound of the words, in which it seemed to me that  I caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting  consciousness--it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize  once more the chance of possessing him. \"Dear little Miles, dear little  Miles, if you KNEW how I want to help you! It's only that, it's nothing  but that, and I'd rather die than give you a pain or do you a wrong--I'd  rather die than hurt a hair of you. Dear little Miles\"--oh, I brought it  out now even if I SHOULD go too far--\"I just want you to help me to save  you!\" But I knew in a moment after this that I had gone too far. The  answer to my appeal was instantaneous, but it came in the form of an  extraordinary blast and chill, a gust of frozen air, and a shake of the  room as great as if, in the wild wind, the casement had crashed in. The  boy gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the shock of  sound, might have seemed, indistinctly, though I was so close to him,  a note either of jubilation or of terror. I jumped to my feet again and  was conscious of darkness. So for a moment we remained, while I stared  about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred and the window  tight. \"Why, the candle's out!\" I then cried.    \"It was I who blew it, dear!\" said Miles.          XVIII      The next day, after lessons, Mrs. Grose found a moment to say to me  quietly: \"Have you written, miss?\"    \"Yes--I've written.\" But I didn't add--for the hour--that my letter,  sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. There would be time enough  to send it before the messenger should go to the village. Meanwhile  there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more  exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to  gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest feats  of arithmetic, soaring quite out of MY feeble range, and perpetrated,  in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical jokes. It was  conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he appeared to wish to  show how easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really  lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate;  there was a distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never  was a small natural creature, to the uninitiated eye all frankness and  freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little gentleman. I had  perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation into which my  initiated view betrayed me; to check the irrelevant gaze and discouraged  sigh in which I constantly both attacked and renounced the enigma of  what such a little gentleman could have done that deserved a penalty.  Say that, by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of all evil HAD  been opened up to him: all the justice within me ached for the proof  that it could ever have flowered into an act.    He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after  our early dinner on this dreadful day, he came round to me and asked if  I shouldn't like him, for half an hour, to play to me. David playing  to Saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion. It was  literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite  tantamount to his saying outright: \"The true knights we love to read  about never push an advantage too far. I know what you mean now: you  mean that--to be let alone yourself and not followed up--you'll cease to  worry and spy upon me, won't keep me so close to you, will let me go  and come. Well, I 'come,' you see--but I don't go! There'll be plenty of  time for that. I do really delight in your society, and I only want to  show you that I contended for a principle.\" It may be imagined whether I  resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand, to  the schoolroom. He sat down at the old piano and played as he had never  played; and if there are those who think he had better have been kicking  a football I can only say that I wholly agree with them. For at the  end of a time that under his influence I had quite ceased to measure, I  started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at my post. It  was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I hadn't  really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much worse--I had  forgotten. Where, all this time, was Flora? When I put the question to  Miles, he played on a minute before answering and then could only say:  \"Why, my dear, how do _I_ know?\"--breaking moreover into a happy laugh  which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he  prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.    I went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before  going downstairs, I looked into several others. As she was nowhere  about she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, in the comfort of that  theory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of. I found her where I had  found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with blank,  scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had  carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right,  for it was the very first time I had allowed the little girl out of my  sight without some special provision. Of course now indeed she might be  with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look for her without  an air of alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but when, ten  minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the hall,  it was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we  had altogether failed to trace her. For a minute there, apart from  observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I could feel with what high  interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first given her.    \"She'll be above,\" she presently said--\"in one of the rooms you haven't  searched.\"    \"No; she's at a distance.\" I had made up my mind. \"She has gone out.\"    Mrs. Grose stared. \"Without a hat?\"    I naturally also looked volumes. \"Isn't that woman always without one?\"    \"She's with HER?\"    \"She's with HER!\" I declared. \"We must find them.\"    My hand was on my friend's arm, but she failed for the moment,  confronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to my  pressure. She communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her  uneasiness. \"And where's Master Miles?\"    \"Oh, HE'S with Quint. They're in the schoolroom.\"    \"Lord, miss!\" My view, I was myself aware--and therefore I suppose my  tone--had never yet reached so calm an assurance.    \"The trick's played,\" I went on; \"they've successfully worked their  plan. He found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she  went off.\"    \"'Divine'?\" Mrs. Grose bewilderedly echoed.    \"Infernal, then!\" I almost cheerfully rejoined. \"He has provided for  himself as well. But come!\"    She had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions. \"You leave him--?\"    \"So long with Quint? Yes--I don't mind that now.\"    She always ended, at these moments, by getting possession of my hand,  and in this manner she could at present still stay me. But after gasping  an instant at my sudden resignation, \"Because of your letter?\" she  eagerly brought out.    I quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter, drew it forth, held it  up, and then, freeing myself, went and laid it on the great hall table.  \"Luke will take it,\" I said as I came back. I reached the house door and  opened it; I was already on the steps.    My companion still demurred: the storm of the night and the early  morning had dropped, but the afternoon was damp and gray. I came down to  the drive while she stood in the doorway. \"You go with nothing on?\"    \"What do I care when the child has nothing? I can't wait to dress,\" I  cried, \"and if you must do so, I leave you. Try meanwhile, yourself,  upstairs.\"    \"With THEM?\" Oh, on this, the poor woman promptly joined me!          XIX      We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay  rightly called, though I reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet  of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes. My  acquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at all  events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection of  my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat moored  there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its  agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the  house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might  be, she was not near home. She had not given me the slip for any small  adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that I had shared  with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to  which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to Mrs. Grose's  steps so marked a direction--a direction that made her, when she  perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly  mystified. \"You're going to the water, Miss?--you think she's IN--?\"    \"She may be, though the depth is, I believe, nowhere very great. But  what I judge most likely is that she's on the spot from which, the other  day, we saw together what I told you.\"    \"When she pretended not to see--?\"    \"With that astounding self-possession? I've always been sure she wanted  to go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her.\"    Mrs. Grose still stood where she had stopped. \"You suppose "]]]
