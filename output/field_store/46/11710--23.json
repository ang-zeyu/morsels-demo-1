All that need be said of the original establishment at Ely has already  been told in the account of the foundress. There is no doubt that in the  monastery there were religious persons of both sexes. Dean Stubbs says  \"the mixed community was the fashion of the time\"[1] and he gives  Coldingham, Kildare, and three in Normandy--Chelles, Autun Brie, and  Fontevrault--as examples of similar foundations. In this instance the  abbess was the head of all; and this accounts for Bede's calling the  house a nunnery. What name was given to the superior of the men's part  does not appear.    Of all the abbesses who ruled over this \"twin monastery\" we know only  the names of the first four; and all these were in due time canonised.  These were S. Etheldreda (673-679), S. Sexburga (679-699), S. Ermenilda  (699-?), and S. Werburga (dates unknown). If we allow ten years for the  duration of the rule of the last two, we still have the names of the  abbesses for only thirty-six years out of the one hundred and  ninety-seven years that the institution lasted. It is said to have been  in a very flourishing condition when the Danes came to destroy it; and  there is no hint anywhere that there was not a continuous succession of  abbesses during the whole period.    S. Sexburga, the elder sister of the foundress, succeeded her as abbess.  She was the widowed queen of Ercombert, King of Kent, and had herself  founded the monastery of Sheppey, at the place now known as Minster, and  set over it her daughter Ermenilda, another widowed queen. S. Sexburga  joined the house at Ely, and had resided there some time before her  sister's death. The body of S. Etheldreda was in her time removed into  the church, under the superintendence of Archbishop Wilfrid. Bede gives  a full account of the translation. The monks who had the charge of  providing a stone coffin suitable for the reception of the remains of  the foundress are said to have \"found\" one of marble among the ruins of  Grantchester, the name of the old town of Cambridge. When disinterred,  the body was reported free from all corruption. The account would not be  complete without the customary miracles--marvellous cures effected by  touching the clothes and coffin, and by the healing efficacy of a spring  that flowed from the place of the first interment. This translation took  place on October 17th, 695. This is the day assigned to the  commemoration of S. Etheldreda. The importance of this festival is  sometimes held to account for the fact that the Feast of S. Luke, on  October 18th, is not preceded by a fast. But as no fast is assigned to  the vigils of the Conversion of S. Paul, S. Mark, or Saints Philip and  James, it is questionable if this opinion is sound. Upon the death of S.  Sexburga, in 699, her body was laid in the church next to that of her  sister.    The next abbess was her daughter, S. Ermenilda. Her husband had been  Wulphere, King of Mercia, who died in 675. She had been professed at  Ely, and left to become the head of her mother's foundation at Sheppey.  The date of her death is not known. She was succeeded, both at Sheppey  and at Ely, by her daughter, S. Werburga. How long she ruled at Ely is  not recorded. She was buried by her own desire at Hanbury, in  Staffordshire. When the Danes reached Derbyshire in their incursions,  this was deemed no longer a safe place, and her body was removed to  Chester, where the cathedral was afterwards placed under the joint  invocation of S. Werburga and S. Oswald.[2] The reason why it is  suggested above that ten years may be taken as the limit of time to be  assigned to the rules of S. Ermenilda and S. Werburga is that the author  of her Life[3] says that her body was taken up \"9 years after her  decease, to translate it to a more eminent part\" of Hanbury Church, by  order of Ceolred, King of Mercia. As this king died at latest in 717, it  would follow that S. Werburga must have died not later than 708.    Probably in the Isle of Ely more special respect was paid to the  festivals of these four sainted abbesses than elsewhere. But we find no  churches dedicated to any of the four in the isle except those  previously named as dedicated to S. Etheldreda, the cathedral, Histon,  and a chapel at Swaffham Prior. Minster Church, in Kent, is dedicated to  Saints Mary and Sexburga. In a tenth-century will of the widowed queen  of Edmund I. we read: \"I give to S. Peter's, and to S. AEtheldryth, and  to S. Wihtburh, and to S. Sexburh, and to S. Eormenhild at Ely where my  lord's body rests, the three lands which we both promised to God and His  saint.\"[4] There were no doubt side-altars erected in honour of one or  more of the four. At Wisbech, for instance, there was a \"light\" of S.  Etheldreda, to which we find persons bequeathing small sums.    Of the monastery of S. Etheldreda and that of Bishop Ethelwold,  Professor Freeman writes that there is \"no continuity between the  two.\"[5] By this we must probably understand that he considered the  original monastery absolutely at an end after its destruction by the  Danes; and that the monastery founded in its place a century later was  something quite new, that had no claim to be regarded as the  continuation of the former one. But the history of the place during the  interval was not an absolute blank.    The Danish destruction took place in 870. The reconstruction by King  Edgar and Bishop Ethelwold took place in 970. In the monastery so  founded, or, as most would prefer to say, resuscitated, there were no  nuns. It has been pointed out that at Ely, unlike other religious houses  in the district, there was not complete desolation during the century  intervening between the destruction of the former and the construction  of the latter house. Some clergy banded themselves together and formed a  religious community, of what precise character is not known, but  apparently it was something in the nature of a college of secular  priests. When the second monastery arose, these clergy were either  absorbed or evicted.    #Brithnoth# (970-981) was the first abbot. He had been Prior of  Winchester. He devoted his energies to the consolidation of the new  house, securing many fresh endowments, settling the boundaries of the  Isle of Ely, and laying out the grounds of the abbey in beautiful order.  The church possessed only the bodies of three of the four saints  connected with the original foundation. There being no hope of  recovering the fourth, Bishop Ethelwold and the abbot resolved to find a  substitute in the body of S. Withburga, the youngest sister of S.  Etheldreda. Her youth had been spent at Holkham, in Norfolk, where the  church is now said to be dedicated to her, and afterwards founded a  nunnery at Dereham, in the same county, where she died and was buried. A  long account is given by Bentham[6] of the trickery by which her body  was purloined and brought to Ely, where it was interred near the bodies  of the three abbesses.[7] Brithnoth is said to have been murdered at  the instigation of Queen Elfrida, having grievously offended her in many  ways, especially by reproving her infamous and abandoned life. This is  the same Elfrida who, two years before, had caused her stepson, King  Edward (thence called the Martyr), to be assassinated in order that her  own son, Ethelred (the Unready), might have the crown. Edward only  reigned four years; but during that time much that his father, King  Edgar, had done towards establishing the monastic rule in England was  set aside. In some instances \"the monastic rule was quashed, and  minsters dissolved, and monks driven out, and God's servants put down,  whom King Edgar had ordered the holy bishop Ethelwold to establish.\"[8]  The queen confessed before her death to having compassed the death of  Abbot Brithnoth. His body was conveyed to Ely for interment.    He was succeeded by #Elsin# (981-1016), \"of a noble family.\" In his  time very considerable donations and bequests were made to the  monastery. In some cases members of the house who rose to eminence and  obtained lucrative appointments became benefactors; sometimes the  parents of young men who joined the society testified their confidence  by munificent gifts; sometimes widows gave manors and lands in their  lifetimes or in their wills. In one case at least much wealth was  acquired by way of penance. Leofwin, a man of large possessions, in a  violent fit of anger had occasioned the death of his own father. In his  remorse he betook himself to Rome to obtain absolution, undertaking to  perform any penance that might be enjoined. The pope required him to  dedicate his eldest son to the religious life in some monastery which he  was liberally to endow, and to bestow largely of his substance to the  relief of the poor. His son Edelmor was accordingly devoted to the  service of God at Ely, and very large estates were assigned by Leofwin  to the monastery. He further improved the church, rebuilding and  enlarging the south aisle, and joining it to the rest of the building;  and in one of its porches, or side-chapels (_in uno porticu_), he built  an altar to the Virgin Mary, erecting over it a stately image of gold  and silver, adorned with valuable jewels. It is probably to this altar  that reference is made when we find some speak as if there were a  lady-chapel in existence before the present one. At Leofwin's death his  body was buried in the church, and to it he bequeathed his entire  property.    Alderman Brithnoth, a man of great rank and eminence, and of great  reputation as a soldier, was another considerable benefactor. On one  occasion he was marching with his forces from the north to encounter the  Danes, who had been plundering in Suffolk and had reached Essex. Passing  Ramsey Abbey, he sent word to the abbot that he proposed to stop there  with his men for refreshment. But the abbot, though willing to entertain  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#18)"],[1,"numbers with the passing of years.  For example, between  the years 1901 to 1910, North {168} Carolina alone passed three hundred  and six different game laws.  As various forms of game birds or animals  showed indications of decreasing in numbers new laws were called into  existence in an attempt to conserve the supply for the benefit of the  people.  Not infrequently laws were passed offering bounties or  otherwise encouraging the killing of wolves, pumas, and other predatory  animals, or of birds regarded as injurious to growing crops or to  poultry raising.    State laws intended primarily for the protection of wild life may be  grouped as follows: (1) naming the time of the year when various kinds  of game may be hunted; these hunting periods are called \"open seasons.\"  (2) The prohibition of certain methods formally employed in taking  game, as, for example, netting, trapping, and shooting at night.  (3)  Prohibiting or regulating the sale of game.  By destroying the market  the incentive for much excessive killing is removed.  (4) Bag limit;  that is, indicating the number of birds or animals that may be shot in  a day; for example, in Louisiana one may kill twenty-five {169} Ducks  in a day, and in Arizona one may shoot two male deer in a season.  (5)  Providing protection at all seasons for useful birds not recognized as  game species.    _Definition of Game._--Game animals as defined today include bears,  coons, deer, mountain sheep, caribou, cougars, musk oxen, white goats,  rabbits, squirrels, opossums, wolves, antelopes, and moose.  Game birds  include Swans, Geese, Ducks, Rails, Coots, Woodcocks, Snipes, Plovers,  Curlews, Wild Turkeys, Grouse, Pheasants, Partridges, and Quails.  Sometimes other birds or animals have been regarded as game.  Robins  and Mourning Doves, for example, are still shot in some of the Southern  States as game birds.    _The Audubon Law._--Little was done in the way of securing laws for the  benefit of song and insectivorous birds and birds of plumage until  1886, when the bird-protection committee of the American  Ornithologists' Union drafted a bill for this specific purpose.  This  bill, besides extending protection to all useful {170} non-game birds,  gave the first clear statutory terminology for defining \"game birds.\"  It also provided for the issuing of permits for the collecting of wild  birds and their eggs for scientific purposes.  The States of New York  and Massachusetts that year adopted the law.  Arkansas followed eleven  years later, but it was not until the Audubon Society workers took up  the subject in 1909 that any special headway was made in getting States  to pass this measure.  To-day it is on the statute books of all the  States of the Union but eight, and is generally known as the Audubon  Law.    _Game Law Enforcement._--In all the States but Florida there are  special State officers charged with enforcing the bird and game  protective laws.  Usually there is a Game Commission of three or more  members whose duty it is to select an executive officer who in turn  appoints game wardens throughout the State.  These men in some cases  are paid salaries, in others they receive only a _per diem_ wage or  receive certain fees for convictions.  License {171} fees are usually  required of hunters, and the moneys thus collected form the basis of a  fund used for paying the wardens and meeting the other expenses  incident to the game law enforcement.    _The Lacey Law._--The Federal Government is taking a share of the  responsibility in preserving the wild life of the Union.    On July 2, 1897, Congressman Lacey introduced in the House a bill to  prohibit the export of big game from some of the Western States.  In  1909 amendments were made to the Lacey Law, one of which prohibited the  shipment of birds or parts thereof from a State in which they had been  illegally killed, or from which it was illegal to ship them.  The  enforcement of this by Federal officers has been most efficacious in  breaking up a great system of smuggling Quails, Grouse, Ducks, and  other game birds.    _Federal Migratory Bird Law._--Probably the most important game law as  yet enacted in the United States is the one known as the Federal  Migratory Game Law or the McLean Law.  A somewhat {172} extended  discussion of this important measure seems justifiable at this time.    [Illustration: Migrative Birds Are Protected by the Government]    When, in 1913, the first breath of autumn swept over the tule sloughs  and reedy lakes of the North-west, the wild fowl and shore birds of  that vast region rose in clouds, and by stages began to journey toward  {173} their winter quarters beneath Southern skies.  If the older birds  that had often taken the same trip thought anything about the subject,  they must have been impressed, when they crossed the border into the  United States, with the fact that changes had taken place in reference  to shooting.    It is true that in Minnesota, for instance, the firing of guns began in  September, as in other years; but those Ducks that reached the  Mississippi River below St. Paul found no one waiting to kill them.  As  they proceeded, by occasional flights, farther down the river there was  still a marked absence of gunners.  The same conditions prevailed all  the way down the valley until the sunken grounds of Arkansas and  Mississippi came into view.  What did this mean?  Heretofore, at this  season, hunters had always lined the river.  This had been the case  ever since the oldest Duck could remember.  The Missouri River, too,  was free from shooting throughout the greater part of its length, which  was sufficient cause for many a grateful quack.    {174}    What was the reason for this great change?  Had the killing of wild  fowl suddenly lost its attraction for those who had been accustomed to  seek pleasure afield with gun and decoys?  No, indeed, banish the  thought, for it is written that so long as man shall live, Wild Duck  shall grace his table and gratify his palate.    The remarkable changes which had so affected the fortunes of the wild  fowl were due to the enactment of a United States law known as the  Federal Migratory Game Law.  Let us see something of this law and of  what led to its establishment.    _History of Game Laws._--When the United States of America became a  free and independent nation the lawmakers in various commonwealths soon  addressed themselves to the task of enacting protective measures for  insuring the continuance of the supply of desirable game birds and  animals.  But as the years went by, and the game showed every  indication of continuing to decrease despite the measures that had been  adopted for their benefit, other and more stringent game laws were  enacted.    {175}    In the fullness of time there came into being in every state in the  Union an extensive, complex system of prohibitive measures regarding  seasons for hunting, methods of killing, size of bag limit,  restrictions on sale, and limiting the kinds of game that might be  killed.    Many states also went into the business of rearing, in a condition of  semi-captivity.  Pheasants, grouse, Hungarian Partridges, Quail, Ducks,  and some other species of birds highly esteemed as food, the object of  this being to restock covers that had been depleted of bird-life by  excessive shooting, or to supply new attraction for field-sports in  regions where other game was limited.    Theoretically the methods adopted by the several states were sure to  keep the numbers of game birds up to a point where a reasonable amount  of sport might be engaged in by those of our citizens who enjoy the  excitement and recreation of going afield with gun and dog.  It could  easily be proven on paper that by judiciously regulating the shooting,  {176} and having this conform to the available game supply, every state  could at one and the same time preserve the different species, and  furnish satisfactory shooting for its sportsmen.    But in practice the theory failed to work as expected; the gunners were  on hand every fall in increasing numbers but the birds continued to  grow scarcer.    In the vernacular of the sportsman, birds that may legitimately be shot  are divided for convenience into three groups, viz., upland game birds,  water fowl, and shore birds.  It is in reference to the fortunes of the  water fowl and shore birds that the greatest apprehension has been  felt.  Approximately all of the species concerned are of migratory  habits.  The open seasons when these may be hunted vary greatly in  different states and all attempts to get anything like uniform laws in  the various hunting territories have been attended with failure.    It became clear in time that the most important action that could be  taken to conserve these birds {177} was to prohibit shooting during the  spring migration, when the birds were on their way to their northern  breeding grounds.  Some states adopted this measure and the results  bore out the predictions of those who urged the passage of such laws.  New York State, for example, tried the experiment, and within two years  thousands of Black Ducks were breeding where for a long time they had  not been known to occur in summer.  So the feeling became general among  bird protectors that it would be an excellent thing if spring shooting  of all migratory game birds should be stopped everywhere.  But the  legislatures of many states paid small heed to the little minority of  their constituents who voiced such sentiments, and the problem of how  to bring about the desired results remained unsolved.
