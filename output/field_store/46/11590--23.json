Of the burghers from Winburg, Kroonstad and Heilbron, many had already  laid down their arms, and the drain upon our troops in these districts  was still continuing.    None of the burghers belonging to the districts of Ficksburg,  Bethlehem,[44] Harrismith and Vrede had yet surrendered--their turn was  to come.    All told, we were 8,000 burghers.    After my men had gone northwards, those burghers of Hoopstad, Jacobsdal,  Fauresmith, Philippolis, Bethulie, Smithfield, Rouxville, Wepener,  Bloemfontein and the southern part of Ladybrand, who had laid down their  arms and remained at home between the beginning of March and the end of  May, were left undisturbed by Lord Roberts--so far as their private  liberty was concerned.           *       *       *       *       *    I was now camped at Frankfort, waiting for the ammunition, which ought  to have already arrived from Greylingstad Station. It was about this  time that the Government decided, on the recommendation of some of the  officers, that the rank of Vechtgeneraal should be abolished. In  consequence of this decision all the officers of that rank resigned. I  did not approve of this course of action, and obtained from the  Government the rank of Assistant Commander-in-Chief. I was thus able to  re-appoint the old Vechtgeneraals, Piet de Wet, C.C. Froneman, Philip  Botha and Paul Roux, and I at once proceeded to do so.    [Footnote 43: Afterwards Commandant, and, still later, Assistant  Commander-in-Chief.]    [Footnote 44: At the conclusion of peace it was the Bethlehem commando  which had the greatest number of burghers under arms.]          CHAPTER XIV    Roodewal      The ammunition arrived safely, and towards the end of May I made my way  to a certain hill, some twelve miles from Heilbron, to which we had  given the name of Presidentskopje, and where Commandants Steenekamp and  J.H. Olivier were posted.    Here I left the greater part of my commandos. But I myself, on the 2nd  of June, set out in the direction of Roodewal Station, taking with me  six hundred burghers, mounted on the best horses that were to be  obtained. I reached the farm of Leeuwfontein the same night, and found  it an excellent place in which to hide my men out of sight of the  Heilbron garrison. The farm stood about nine miles to the south of that  town.    The following evening we moved on as far as Smithsdrift, which is a  drift on the road from Heilbron to Kroonstad. There again I concealed my  men.    On the afternoon of the next day, June the 4th, news was brought me that  a convoy was on its way to Heilbron from Rhenoster River. This convoy  encamped that evening at the distance of a mile from the farm of  Zwavelkrans; the spot chosen was about five hundred paces from the  Rhenoster River, and quite unprotected.    Before sunrise I sent a party of burghers down to the river, some five  hundred paces from where the convoy was encamped, and by daybreak we had  entirely surrounded the enemy.    No sooner had the sun appeared than I despatched a burgher with a white  flag to the English officer in command. I ordered my messenger to  inform the officer that he was surrounded, that escape was out of the  question, and that if he wished to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, his only  course was to surrender.    [Illustration: ROODEWAL.    FROM A SKETCH BY THE AUTHOR.]    On hearing this one of their men came to me with the object of demanding  certain conditions. It goes without saying that my answer  was--\"Unconditional surrender!\"    He asked for time to communicate this to the officer in command. I  granted this request, and he returned to the convoy.    We were not left in suspense for long. The white flag was hoisted almost  immediately, and two hundred _Bergschotten_,[45] with fifty-six heavily  laden waggons, fell into our hands.    Fortunately, all this occurred out of sight of Roodewal Station and  Heilbron, and, as not a single shot had been fired, I had no reason so  far to fear that there was any obstacle in the way of my main  project--the capture of the valuable booty at Roodewal.    I at once returned with my capture to the spot where we had been the  previous night. General Philip Botha conducted the prisoners and the  booty to the President's camp, returning to our laager on the following  morning.    On the evening of the 6th of June I started on my road to Roodewal. At  Walfontein I divided my troops into three parties. The first party,  consisting of three hundred men with one Krupp, I despatched under  Commandant Steenekamp to Vredefort Road Station, with orders to attack  it the following day at sunrise. General Froneman, with Commandants Nel  and Du Plooij, were in command of the second party, which consisted of  three hundred burghers, with two Krupps and one quick-firing gun. My  orders were that, at daybreak, they were to attack an English camp which  was lying a mile to the north of the railway station at Rhenoster River,  and close to some brick-coloured ridges. The third party I commanded  myself. It consisted of Commandant Fourie and eighty burghers, with one  Krupp; and with this force I pushed on to Roodewal Station.    At Doorndraai I left behind me a few waggons, with twenty men to guard  them. I had previously stationed a hundred burghers there, with the  object of keeping in touch with the enemy.    The information which Captain Scheepers had gained while scouting was  amply sufficient to show me how the land lay.    Although I had heard that there were not more than fifty of the enemy at  Vredefort Road Station, I had nevertheless sent three hundred burghers  there. This was because I was aware that the main English force lay to  the north of the station, so that these fifty men might be reinforced at  the shortest possible notice. The numbers which General Froneman had to  encounter were much greater, and the enemy held safe positions. But as  General Froneman was himself able to take quite as good positions, I  only gave him the same number of troops as I had assigned to Commandant  Steenekamp. I also gave orders that two guns should proceed with him.    I was informed that there were only one hundred of the English at  Roodewal, but that these hundred were very securely entrenched. My  information was, however, at fault, for I discovered later on that there  were at least double that number.    I arrived at Roodewal very early in the morning of the 7th of June. I  brought my men up to within eight hundred paces of the station, and  ordered them to unharness the horses which were attached to the Krupp,  and to place it in position.    But listen! There is the crack of rifles in the distance! That must be  the sound of the enemy's fire on General Froneman. Again, and yet again,  the sound meets my ears. Then all is quiet once more.    It was still two hours before the sun would rise, and I took full  advantage of the opportunities which the darkness gave me. I ordered  four of my burghers to approach as close to the station as was possible,  and to find out everything they could about the enemy's position.  Following my directions, they crept with extreme caution towards the  English lines, until only a hundred paces separated them from the  station. They returned before it was light, and brought back word that  unless the enemy had thrown up unusually high _schanzes_, there must be  an untold quantity of provisions piled up there. Everything had been  very quiet, and they had seen no one stirring.    The day now began to dawn, and as soon as it was light I sent a message  to the enemy demanding their surrender. The answer came back at once. On  the back of my note these words had been written:    \"We refuse to surrender.\"    I instantly opened a hot fire upon them, bringing the Krupp as well as  the Mausers into action. But the reply of the enemy was no less severe.    We had no cover. There was only a shallow _pan_[46]--so shallow that it  scarcely afforded protection to the horses' hoofs! A thousand paces to  the north-west of the railway I had observed a deep _pan_ where the  horses would have had better cover, but even there our men would have  been just as exposed as they now were. I had decided against taking up  my position in this _pan_, because I should have been obliged to cross  the line to reach it, and in doing so should have run the risk of being  observed by the English.    Thus it was that the burghers were compelled to lie flat down in order  to afford as little mark as possible to the enemy. But the men who  served the Krupp were naturally unable to do this; and, seeing that the  gun must be moved, I gave this order: \"Inspan the gun, gallop it three  thousand paces back; then blaze away again as fiercely as you can!\"    Under a hail of bullets the horses were attached to the gun. Whilst  this was being done, I ordered my men to fire upon the English  entrenchments with redoubled energy, and thus, if possible, prevent the  enemy from taking careful aim.    Incredible though it may appear, Captain Muller got the gun away without  a single man or horse being hit. When he had covered three thousand  paces, he halted, and turning the Krupp on the enemy, he shelled them  with good effect.    At about ten o'clock, General Froneman succeeded in forcing the English  troops which he had attacked to surrender. I therefore ordered the two  Krupps which he had with him to be brought up with the utmost despatch.  At half-past seven they arrived, and immediately opened fire on the  English.    When the enemy had been under the fire of three guns and eighty Mausers  for an hour, they thought it best to hoist the white flag. We  accordingly ceased firing, and I rode out towards the station. Before I  had reached it, I was met by two of the officers.

Then back and forth  Carley's gaze went from one end to the other of that scene. And suddenly  it was arrested and held by the huge fellow who handled the sheep so  brutally. Every time he dragged one and threw it into the pit he yelled:  \"Ho! Ho!\" Carley was impelled to look at his face, and she was amazed to  meet the rawest and boldest stare from evil eyes that had ever been her  misfortune to incite. She felt herself stiffen with a shock that was  unfamiliar. This man was scarcely many years older than Glenn, yet he  had grizzled hair, a seamed and scarred visage, coarse, thick lips, and  beetling brows, from under which peered gleaming light eyes. At every  turn he flashed them upon Carley's face, her neck, the swell of her  bosom. It was instinct that caused her hastily to close her riding coat.  She felt as if her flesh had been burned. Like a snake he fascinated  her. The intelligence in his bold gaze made the beastliness of it all  the harder to endure, all the stronger to arouse.    \"Come, Carley, let's rustle out of this stinkin' mess,\" cried Flo.    Indeed, Carley needed Flo's assistance in clambering down out of the  choking smoke and horrid odor.    \"Adios, pretty eyes,\" called the big man from the pen.    \"Well,\" ejaculated Flo, when they got out, \"I'll bet I call Glenn good  and hard for letting you go down there.\"    \"It was--my--fault,\" panted Carley. \"I said I'd stand it.\"    \"Oh, you're game, all right. I didn't mean the dip.... That  sheep-slinger is Haze Ruff, the toughest hombre on this range. Shore,  now, wouldn't I like to take a shot at him?... I'm going to tell dad and  Glenn.\"    \"Please don't,\" returned Carley, appealingly.    \"I shore am. Dad needs hands these days. That's why he's lenient. But  Glenn will cowhide Ruff and I want to see him do it.\"    In Flo Hutter then Carley saw another and a different spirit of the  West, a violence unrestrained and fierce that showed in the girl's even  voice and in the piercing light of her eyes.    They went back to the horses, got their lunches from the saddlebags,  and, finding comfortable seats in a sunny, protected place, they ate  and talked. Carley had to force herself to swallow. It seemed that the  horrid odor of dip and sheep had permeated everything. Glenn had known  her better than she had known herself, and he had wished to spare her an  unnecessary and disgusting experience. Yet so stubborn was Carley that  she did not regret going through with it.    \"Carley, I don't mind telling you that you've stuck it out better than  any tenderfoot we ever had here,\" said Flo.    \"Thank you. That from a Western girl is a compliment I'll not soon  forget,\" replied Carley.    \"I shore mean it. We've had rotten weather. And to end the little trip  at this sheep-dip hole! Why, Glenn certainly wanted you to stack up  against the real thing!\"    \"Flo, he did not want me to come on the trip, and especially here,\"  protested Carley.    \"Shore I know. But he let you.\"    \"Neither Glenn nor any other man could prevent me from doing what I  wanted to do.\"    \"Well, if you'll excuse me,\" drawled Flo, \"I'll differ with you. I  reckon Glenn Kilbourne is not the man you knew before the war.\"    \"No, he is not. But that does not alter the case.\"    \"Carley, we're not well acquainted,\" went on Flo, more carefully feeling  her way, \"and I'm not your kind. I don't know your Eastern ways. But I  know what the West does to a man. The war ruined your friend--both his  body and mind.... How sorry mother and I were for Glenn, those days  when it looked he'd sure 'go west,' for good!... Did you know he'd been  gassed and that he had five hemorrhages?\"    \"Oh! I knew his lungs had been weakened by gas. But he never told me  about having hemorrhages.\"    \"Well, he shore had them. The last one I'll never forget. Every time  he'd cough it would fetch the blood. I could tell!... Oh, it was awful.  I begged him not to cough. He smiled--like a ghost smiling--and he  whispered, 'I'll quit.'... And he did. The doctor came from Flagstaff  and packed him in ice. Glenn sat propped up all night and never moved a  muscle. Never coughed again! And the bleeding stopped. After that we  put him out on the porch where he could breathe fresh air all the time.  There's something wonderfully healing in Arizona air. It's from the dry  desert and here it's full of cedar and pine. Anyway Glenn got well. And  I think the West has cured his mind, too.\"    \"Of what?\" queried Carley, in an intense curiosity she could scarcely  hide.    \"Oh, God only knows!\" exclaimed Flo, throwing up her gloved hands. \"I  never could understand. But I hated what the war did to him.\"    Carley leaned back against the log, quite spent. Flo was unwittingly  torturing her. Carley wanted passionately to give in to jealousy of this  Western girl, but she could not do it. Flo Hutter deserved better than  that. And Carley's baser nature seemed in conflict with all that was  noble in her. The victory did not yet go to either side. This was a bad  hour for Carley. Her strength had about played out, and her spirit was  at low ebb.    \"Carley, you're all in,\" declared Flo. \"You needn't deny it. I'm shore  you've made good with me as a tenderfoot who stayed the limit. But  there's no sense in your killing yourself, nor in me letting you. So I'm  going to tell dad we want to go home.\"    She left Carley there. The word home had struck strangely into Carley's  mind and remained there. Suddenly she realized what it was to be  homesick. The comfort, the ease, the luxury, the rest, the sweetness,  the pleasure, the cleanliness, the gratification to eye and ear--to all  the senses--how these thoughts came to haunt her! All of Carley's will  power had been needed to sustain her on this trip to keep her from  miserably failing. She had not failed. But contact with the West had  affronted, disgusted, shocked, and alienated her. In that moment she  could not be fair minded; she knew it; she did not care.    Carley gazed around her. Only one of the cabins was in sight from this  position. Evidently it was a home for some of these men. On one side the  peaked rough roof had been built out beyond the wall, evidently to serve  as a kind of porch. On that wall hung the motliest assortment of things  Carley had ever seen--utensils, sheep and cow hides, saddles, harness,  leather clothes, ropes, old sombreros, shovels, stove pipe, and many  other articles for which she could find no name. The most striking  characteristic manifest in this collection was that of service. How  they had been used! They had enabled people to live under primitive  conditions. Somehow this fact inhibited Carley's sense of repulsion at  their rude and uncouth appearance. Had any of her forefathers ever been  pioneers? Carley did not know, but the thought was disturbing. It was  thought-provoking. Many times at home, when she was dressing for dinner,  she had gazed into the mirror at the graceful lines of her throat and  arms, at the proud poise of her head, at the alabaster whiteness of her  skin, and wonderingly she had asked of her image: \"Can it be possible  that I am a descendant of cavemen?\" She had never been able to realize  it, yet she knew it was true. Perhaps somewhere not far back along her  line there had been a great-great-grandmother who had lived some kind of  a primitive life, using such implements and necessaries as hung on this  cabin wall, and thereby helped some man to conquer the wilderness, to  live in it, and reproduce his kind. Like flashes Glenn's words came back  to Carley--\"Work and children!\"    Some interpretation of his meaning and how it related to this hour held  aloof from Carley. If she would ever be big enough to understand it and  broad enough to accept it the time was far distant. Just now she was  sore and sick physically, and therefore certainly not in a receptive  state of mind. Yet how could she have keener impressions than these she  was receiving? It was all a problem. She grew tired of thinking. But  even then her mind pondered on, a stream of consciousness over which she  had no control. This dreary woods was deserted. No birds, no squirrels,  no creatures such as fancy anticipated! In another direction, across the  canyon, she saw cattle, gaunt, ragged, lumbering, and stolid. And on the  moment the scent of sheep came on the breeze. Time seemed to stand still  here, and what Carley wanted most was for the hours and days to fly, so  that she would be home again.    At last Flo returned with the men. One quick glance at Glenn convinced  Carley that Flo had not yet told him about the sheep dipper, Haze Ruff.    \"Carley, you're a real sport,\" declared Glenn, with the rare smile she  loved. \"It's a dreadful mess. And to think you stood it!... Why, old  Fifth Avenue, if you needed to make another hit with me you've done it!\"    His warmth amazed and pleased Carley. She could not quite understand  why it would have made any difference to him whether she had stood the  ordeal or not. But then every day she seemed to drift a little farther  from a real understanding of her lover. His praise gladdened her, and  fortified her to face the rest of this ride back to Oak Creek.    Four hours later, in a twilight so shadowy that no one saw her distress,  Carley half slipped and half fell from her horse and managed somehow to  mount the steps and enter the bright living room. A cheerful red fire  blazed on the hearth; Glenn's hound, Moze, trembled eagerly at sight of  her and looked up with humble dark eyes; the white-clothed dinner table  steamed with savory dishes. Flo stood before the blaze, warming her  hands. Lee Stanton leaned against the mantel, with eyes on her, and  every line of his lean, hard face expressed his devotion to her.  Hutter was taking his seat at the head of the table. \"Come an' get  it--you-all,\" he"]]]
