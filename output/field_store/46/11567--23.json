It is generally believed that the parent  birds carry them. Mr. Stuart Baker writes that a very intelligent  native once told him that, early one morning, before it was light, he  was fishing in a tank, when he saw a bird flutter heavily into the  water from a tree in front of him and some twenty paces distant. The  bird returned to the tree, and again, with much beating of the wings,  fluttered down to the surface of the tank; this performance was  repeated again and again at intervals of some minutes. At first the  native could only make out that the cause of the commotion was a bird  of some kind, but after a few minutes, he, remaining crouched among  the reeds and bushes, saw distinctly that it was a cotton-teal, and  that each time it flopped into the water and rose again it left a  gosling behind it. The young ones were carried somehow in the feet,  but the parent bird seemed to find the carriage of its offspring no  easy matter; it flew with difficulty, and fell into the water with  considerable force.    August is the month in which some fortunate observer will one year be  able to confirm or refute this story.    The comb-duck or _nukta_ (_Sarcidiornis melanotus_), which looks more  like a freak of some domesticated breed than one of nature's own  creatures, makes, in July or August, a nest of grass and sticks in a  hole in a tree or in the fork of a stout branch. Sometimes disused  nests of other species are utilised. About a dozen eggs is the usual  number of the clutch, but Anderson once found a nest containing no  fewer than forty eggs.    The lesser whistling-teal (_Dendrocygna javanica_) usually builds its  nest in a hollow in a tree. Sometimes it makes use of the deserted  nursery of another species, and there are many cases on record of the  nest being on the ground, a _bund_, or a piece of high ground in a  _jhil_. Eight or ten eggs are laid.    The little grebe or dabchick (_Podiceps albipennis_) is another  species that lays in July or August. This bird, which looks like a  miniature greyish-brown duck without a tail, must be familiar to  Anglo-Indians, since at least one pair are to be seen on almost every  pond or tank in Northern India. Although permanent residents in this  country, little grebes leave, in the \"rains,\" those tanks that do not  afford plenty of cover, and betake themselves to a _jhil_ where  vegetation is luxuriant. The nest, like that of other species that  build floating cradles, is a tangle of weeds and rushes. When the  incubating bird leaves the nest she invariably covers the white eggs  with wet weeds, and, as Hume remarks, it is almost impossible to catch  the old bird on the nest or to take her so much by surprise as not to  allow her time to cover up the eggs. As a matter of fact, these birds  spend very little time upon the nest in the day-time. The sun's rays  are powerful enough not only to supply the heat necessary for  incubation but to bake the eggs. This _contretemps_, however, is  avoided by placing wet weeds on the eggs and by the general moisture  of the nest. No better idea of the heat of India during the monsoon  can be furnished than that afforded by the case of some cattle-egrets'  eggs taken by a friend of the writer's in August, 1913. He found a  clutch of four eggs; not having leisure at the time to blow them, he  placed them in a bowl on the drawing-room mantelshelf. On the evening  of the following day he heard some squeaks, but, thinking that these  sounds emanated from a musk-rat or one of the other numerous rent-free  tenants of every Indian bungalow, paid little heed to them. When,  however, the same sounds were heard some hours later and appeared to  emanate from the mantelpiece, he went to the bowl, and, lo and behold,  two young egrets had emerged! These were at once fed. They lived for  three days and appeared to be in good health, when they suddenly gave  up the ghost.          SEPTEMBER      And sweet it is by lonely meres    To sit, with heart and soul awake,    Where water-lilies lie afloat,    Each anchored like a fairy boat    Amid some fabled elfin lake:    To see the birds flit to and fro    Along the dark-green reedy edge.                              MARY HOWITT.      September is a much-abused month. Many people assert that it is the  most unpleasant and unhealthy season of the year.    Malarial and muggy though it is, September scarcely merits all the  evil epithets that are applied to it. The truth is that, after the  torrid days of the hot weather and the humid heat of the rainy season,  the European is thoroughly weary of his tropical surroundings, his  vitality is at a low ebb, he is languid and irritable, thus he  complains bitterly of the climate of September, notwithstanding the  fact that it is a distinct improvement on that of the two preceding  months.    In the early part of the month the weather differs little from that of  July and August. The days are somewhat shorter and the sun's rays  somewhat less powerful, in consequence the average temperature is  slightly lower. Normally the rains cease in the second half of the  month. Then the sky resumes the fleckless blueness which characterises  it during the greater part of the year. The blue of the sky is more  pure and more intense in September than at other times, except during  breaks in the monsoon, because the rain has washed from the atmosphere  the myriads of specks of dust that are usually suspended in it.    The cessation of the rains is followed by a period of steamy heat. As  the moisture of the air gradually diminishes the temperature rises.  But each September day is shorter than the one before it, and, hour by  hour, the rays of the sun part with some of their power. Towards the  end of the month the nights are cooler than they have been for some  time. At sunset the village smoke begins to hang low in a diaphanous  cloud--a sure sign of the approaching cold weather. The night dews are  heavy. In the morning the blades of grass and the webs of the spiders  are bespangled with pearly dewdrops. Cool zephyrs greet the rising  sun. At dawn there is, in the last days of the month, a touch of cold  in the air.    The Indian countryside displays a greenness which is almost  spring-like; not quite spring-like, because the fierce greens induced  by the monsoon rains are not of the same hues as those of the young  leaves of spring. The foliage is almost entirely free from dust. This  fact adds to the vernal appearance of the landscape. The _jhils_ and  tanks are filled with water, and, being overgrown with luxuriant  vegetation, enhance the beauty of the scene. But, almost immediately  after the cessation of the rains, the country begins to assume its  usual look. Day by day the grass loses a little of its greenness. The  earth dries up gradually, and its surface once more becomes dusty. The  dust is carried to the foliage, on which it settles, subduing the  natural greenery of the leaves. No sooner do the rains cease than the  rivers begin to fall. By November most of them will be sandy wastes in  which the insignificant stream is almost lost to view.    The mimosas flower in September. Their yellow spherical blossoms are  rendered pale by contrast with the deep gold hue of the blooms of the  _san_ (hemp) which now form a conspicuous feature of the landscape in  many districts. The cork trees (_Millingtonia hortensis_) become  bespangled with hanging clusters of white, long-tubed, star-like  flowers that give out fragrant perfume at night.    The first-fruits of the autumn harvest are being gathered in. Acre  upon acre of the early-sown rice falls before the sickle. The  threshing-floors once again become the scene of animation. The fallow  fields are being prepared for the spring crops and the sowing of the  grain is beginning.    Throughout the month insect life is as rich and varied as it was in  July and August.    The brain-fever bird and the koel call so seldom in September that  their cries, when heard, cause surprise. The voice of the pied  crested-cuckoo no longer falls upon the ear, nor does the song of the  magpie-robin. The green barbets lift up their voices fairly  frequently, but it is only on rare occasions that their cousins--the  coppersmiths--hammer on their anvils. The pied mynas are far less  vociferous than they were in July and August.    By the end of September the bird chorus has assumed its winter form,  except that the grey-headed flycatchers have not joined it in numbers.    Apart from the sharp notes of the warblers, the cooing of the doves,  the hooting of the crow-pheasants, the wailing of the kites, the  cawing of the crows, the screaming of the green parrots, the  chattering of the mynas and the seven sisters, the trumpeting of the  sarus cranes and the clamouring of the lapwings, almost the only bird  voices commonly heard are those of the fantail flycatcher, the  amadavat, the wagtail, the oriole, the roller and the sunbird.    The cock sunbirds are singing brilliantly although they are still  wearing their workaday garments, which are quaker brown save for one  purple streak along the median line of the breast and abdomen.    Many birds are beginning to moult. They are casting off worn feathers  and assuming the new ones that will keep them warm during the cool  winter months. With most birds the new feathers grow as fast as the  old ones fall out. In a few, however, the process of renewal does not  keep pace with that of shedding; the result is that the moulting bird  presents a mangy appearance. The mynas afford conspicuous examples of  this; when moulting their necks often become almost nude, so that the  birds bear some resemblance to miniature vultures.    Great changes in the avifauna take place in September.    The yellow-throated sparrows, the koels, the sunbirds, the bee-eaters,  the red turtle-doves and the majority of the king-crows leave the  Punjab."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#18)"],[1,"s, commaunded a generall Proclamation, that all Iustices of  Peace that had taken any Recognisaunces, or Examinations of Prisoners,  should make Returne of them: And all such as were bound to prosecute  Indictmentes, and giue Euidence against Witches, should proceede, and  giue attendance: For hee now intended to proceede to the Arraignement  and Tryall of Witches.

[Illustration: decoration]    The Arraignement and  Tryall of Anne Whittle, _alias_ Chattox,  of the Forrest of _Pendle_, in the Countie  of _Lancaster_, Widdow;  about the age of Fourescore  yeares, or thereaboutes.    _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox._    If in this damnable course of life, and offences, more horrible and  odious, then any man is able to expresse: any man lyuing could lament  the estate of any such like vpon earth: The example of this poore  creature, would haue moued pittie, in respect of her great contrition  and repentance, after she was committed to the Castle at _Lancaster_,  vntill the comming of his Maiesties Iudges of Assise. But such was the  nature of her offences, & the multitude of her crying sinnes, as it  tooke away all sense of humanity. And the repetition of her hellish  practises, and Reuenge; being the chiefest thinges wherein she alwayes  tooke great delight, togeather with a particular declaration of the  Murders shee had committed, layde open to the world, and giuen in  Euidence against her at the time of her Arraignement and Tryall; as  certainely it did beget contempt in the Audience, and such as she  neuer offended.    This _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, was a very old withered spent  and decreped creature, her sight almost gone: A dangerous Witch, of  very long continuance; alwayes opposite to old _Demdike_: For whom the  one fauoured, the other hated deadly: [Sidenote: _Her owne  examination_] and how they enuie and accuse one an other, in their  Examinations, may appeare.    In her Witchcraft, alwayes more ready to doe mischiefe to mens goods,  then themselues. Her lippes euer chattering and walking:[D2_a_1] but  no man knew what. She liued in the Forrest of _Pendle_, amongst this  wicked company of dangerous Witches. Yet in her Examination and  Confession, she dealt alwayes very plainely and truely: for vpon a  speciall occasion being oftentimes examined in open Court, shee was  neuer found to vary, but alwayes to agree in one, and the selfe same  thing.    I place her in order, next to that wicked fire-brand of mischiefe, old  _Demdike_, because from these two, sprung all the rest in  order:[D2_a_2] and were the Children and Friendes, of these two  notorious Witches.    Many thinges in the discouery of them, shall be very worthy your  obseruation. As the times and occasions to execute their mischiefe.  And this in generall: the Spirit could neuer hurt, till they gaue  consent.    And, but that it is my charge, to set foorth a particular Declaration  of the Euidence against them, vpon their Arraignement and Tryall; with  their Diuelish practises, consultations, meetings, and murders  committed by them, in such sort, as they were giuen in Euidence  against them; for the which, I shall haue matter vpon Record. I could  make a large Comentarie of them: But it is my humble duety, to obserue  the Charge and Commaundement of these my Honorable good Lordes the  Iudges of Assise, and not to exceed the limits of my Commission.  Wherefore I shall now bring this auncient Witch, to the due course of  her Tryall, in order. _viz._      Indictment.    This _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, of the Forrest of _Pendle_ in  the Countie of _Lancaster_ Widdow, being Indicted, for that shee  feloniously had practised, vsed, and exercised diuers wicked and  diuelish Artes called Witchcraftes, Inchauntmentes, Charmes, and  Sorceries, in and vpon one _Robert Nutter_ of _Greenehead_, in the  Forrest of _Pendle_, in the Countie of _Lanc_: and by force of the  same Witchcraft, feloniously the sayd _Robert Nutter_ had killed,  _Contra Pacem, &c._ Being at the Barre, was arraigned.    To this Indictment, vpon her Arraignement, shee pleaded, Not guiltie:  and for the tryall of her life, put her selfe vpon God and her  Country.    Wherevpon my Lord _Bromley_ commaunded M. Sheriffe of the County of  _Lancaster_ in open Court, to returne a Iurie of worthy sufficient  Gentlemen of vnderstanding, to passe betweene our soueraigne Lord the  Kinges Maiestie, and her, and others the Prisoners, vpon their liues  and deathes; as hereafter follow in order: who were afterwardes  sworne, according to the forme and order of the Court, the Prisoners  being admitted to their lawfull challenges.

Viz.    The sayd _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, vpon her Examination,  voluntarily confesseth, and sayth, That about foureteene or fifteene  yeares agoe, a thing like a Christian man for foure yeares togeather,  did sundry times come to this Examinate, and requested this Examinate  to giue him her Soule: And in the end, this Examinate was contented to  giue him her sayd Soule, shee being then in her owne house, in the  Forrest of _Pendle_; wherevpon the Deuill then in the shape of a Man,  sayd to this Examinate: Thou shalt want nothing; and be reuenged of  whom thou list. And the Deuill then further commaunded this  Examinate, to call him by the name of _Fancie_;[D3_a_] and when she  wanted any thing, or would be reuenged of any, call on _Fancie_, and  he would be ready. And the sayd Spirit or Deuill, did appeare vnto her  not long after, in mans likenesse, and would haue had this Examinate  to haue consented, that he might hurt the wife of _Richard Baldwin_ of  _Pendle_;[D3_b_1] But this Examinate would not then consent vnto him:  For which cause, the sayd Deuill would then haue bitten her by the  arme; and so vanished away, for that time.    And this Examinate further sayth, that _Robert Nutter_[D3_b_2] did  desire her Daughter one _Redfearns_ wife, to haue his pleasure of her,  being then in _Redfearns_ house: but the sayd _Redfearns_ wife denyed  the sayd _Robert_; wherevpon the sayd _Robert_ seeming to be greatly  displeased therewith, in a great anger tooke his Horse, and went away,  saying in a great rage, that if euer the Ground came to him, shee  should neuer dwell vpon his Land. Wherevpon this Examinate called  _Fancie_ to her; who came to her in the likenesse of a Man in a  parcell of Ground called, _The Laund_; asking this Examinate, what  shee would haue him to doe? And this Examinate bade him goe reuenge  her of the sayd _Robert Nutter_. After which time, the sayd _Robert  Nutter_ liued about a quarter of a yeare, and then dyed.    And this Examinate further sayth, that _Elizabeth Nutter_, wife to old  _Robert Nutter_, did request this Examinate, and _Loomeshaws_ wife of  _Burley_, and one _Iane Boothman_, of the same, who are now both dead,  (which time of request, was before that _Robert Nutter_ desired the  company of _Redfearns_ wife) to get young _Robert Nutter_ his death,  if they could; all being togeather then at that time, to that end,  that if _Robert_ were dead, then the Women their Coosens might haue  the Land: By whose perswasion, they all consented vnto it. After which  time, this Examinates Sonne in law _Thomas Redfearne_, did perswade  this Examinate, not to kill or hurt the sayd _Robert Nutter_; for  which perswasion, the sayd _Loomeshaws_ Wife, had like to haue killed  the sayd _Redfearne_, but that one M. _Baldwyn_ (the late  Schoole-maister at _Coulne_) did by his learning, stay the sayd  _Loomeshaws_ wife, and therefore had a Capon from _Redfearne_.[D4_a_]    And this Examinate further sayth, that she thinketh the sayd  _Loomeshaws_ wife, and _Iane Boothman_, did what they could to kill  the sayd _Robert Nutter_, as well as this Examinate did.           *       *       *       *       *    _The Examination of_ ELIZABETH  SOTHERNES, alias OLD DEMBDIKE: _taken at  the Fence in the Forrest of Pendle in the Countie of Lancaster,  the day and yeare aforesaid._    Before,    ROGER NOWEL _Esquire, one of the Kings Maiesties  Iustices of Peace in the said Countie, against_ ANNE  WHITTLE, alias CHATTOX.
