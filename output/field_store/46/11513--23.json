Tell me, if ye are men of  truth.\"(113) And now, be fair; How could those people living in the days  of Muhammad have existed, thousands of years before, in the age of Adam or  other Prophets? Why should Muhammad, that Essence of truthfulness, have  charged the people of His day with the murder of Abel or other Prophets?  Thou hast none other alternative except to regard Muhammad as an impostor  or a fool--which God forbid!--or to maintain that those people of wickedness  were the self-same people who in every age opposed and caviled at the  Prophets and Messengers of God, till they finally caused them all to  suffer martyrdom.    Ponder this in thine heart, that the sweet gales of divine knowledge,  blowing from the meads of mercy, may waft upon thee the fragrance of the  Beloved's utterance, and cause thy soul to attain the Ridvan of  understanding. As the wayward of every age have failed to fathom the  deeper import of these weighty and pregnant utterances, and imagined the  answer of the Prophets of God to be irrelevant to the questions they asked  them, they therefore have attributed ignorance and folly to those Essences  of knowledge and understanding.    Likewise, Muhammad, in another verse, uttereth His protest against the  people of that age. He saith: \"Although they had before prayed for victory  over those who believed not, yet when there came unto them, He of Whom  they had knowledge, they disbelieved in Him. The curse of God on the  infidels!\"(114) Reflect how this verse also implieth that the people  living in the days of Muhammad were the same people who in the days of the  Prophets of old contended and fought in order to promote the Faith, and  teach the Cause, of God. And yet, how could the generations living at the  time of Jesus and Moses, and those who lived in the days of Muhammad, be  regarded as being actually one and the same people? Moreover, those whom  they had formerly known were Moses, the Revealer of the Pentateuch, and  Jesus, the Author of the Gospel. Notwithstanding, why did Muhammad say:  \"When He of Whom they had knowledge came unto them\"--that is Jesus or  Moses--\"they disbelieved in Him?\" Was not Muhammad to outward seeming  called by a different name? Did He not come forth out of a different city?  Did He not speak a different language, and reveal a different Law? How  then can the truth of this verse be established, and its meaning be made  clear?    Strive therefore to comprehend the meaning of \"return\" which hath been so  explicitly revealed in the Qur'an itself, and which none hath as yet  understood. What sayest thou? If thou sayest that Muhammad was the  \"return\" of the Prophets of old, as is witnessed by this verse, His  Companions must likewise be the \"return\" of the bygone Companions, even as  the \"return\" of the former people is clearly attested by the text of the  above-mentioned verses. And if thou deniest this, thou hast surely  repudiated the truth of the Qur'an, the surest testimony of God unto men.  In like manner, endeavour to grasp the significance of \"return,\"  \"revelation,\" and \"resurrection,\" as witnessed in the days of the  Manifestations of the divine Essence, that thou mayest behold with thine  own eyes the \"return\" of the holy souls into sanctified and illumined  bodies, and mayest wash away the dust of ignorance, and cleanse the  darkened self with the waters of mercy flowing from the Source of divine  Knowledge; that perchance thou mayest, through the power of God and the  light of divine guidance, distinguish the Morn of everlasting splendour  from the darksome night of error.    Furthermore, it is evident to thee that the Bearers of the trust of God  are made manifest unto the peoples of the earth as the Exponents of a new  Cause and the Bearers of a new Message. Inasmuch as these Birds of the  Celestial Throne are all sent down from the heaven of the Will of God, and  as they all arise to proclaim His irresistible Faith, they therefore are  regarded as one soul and the same person. For they all drink from the one  Cup of the love of God, and all partake of the fruit of the same Tree of  Oneness. These Manifestations of God have each a twofold station. One is  the station of pure abstraction and essential unity. In this respect, if  thou callest them all by one name, and dost ascribe to them the same  attribute, thou hast not erred from the truth. Even as He hath revealed:  \"No distinction do We make between any of His Messengers!\"(115) For they  one and all summon the people of the earth to acknowledge the Unity of  God, and herald unto them the Kawthar of an infinite grace and bounty.  They are all invested with the robe of Prophethood, and honoured with the  mantle of glory. Thus hath Muhammad, the Point of the Qur'an, revealed: \"I  am all the Prophets.\" Likewise, He saith: \"I am the first Adam, Noah,  Moses, and Jesus.\" Similar statements have been made by 'Ali. Sayings such  as this, which indicate the essential unity of those Exponents of Oneness,  have also emanated from the Channels of God's immortal utterance, and the  Treasuries of the gems of divine knowledge, and have been recorded in the  scriptures. These Countenances are the recipients of the Divine Command,  and the day-springs of His Revelation. This Revelation is exalted above  the veils of plurality and the exigencies of number. Thus He saith: \"Our  Cause is but one.\"(116) Inasmuch as the Cause is one and the same, the  Exponents thereof also must needs be one and the same. Likewise, the Imams  of the Muhammadan Faith, those lamps of certitude, have said: \"Muhammad is  our first, Muhammad our last, Muhammad our all.\"    It is clear and evident to thee that all the Prophets are the Temples of  the Cause of God, Who have appeared clothed in divers attire. If thou wilt  observe with discriminating eyes, thou wilt behold them all abiding in the  same tabernacle, soaring in the same heaven, seated upon the same throne,  uttering the same speech, and proclaiming the same Faith. Such is the  unity of those Essences of being, those Luminaries of infinite and  immeasurable splendour. Wherefore, should one of these Manifestations of  Holiness proclaim saying: \"I am the return of all the Prophets,\" He verily  speaketh the truth. In like manner, in every subsequent Revelation, the  return of the former Revelation is a fact, the truth of which is firmly  established. Inasmuch as the return of the Prophets of God, as attested by  verses and traditions, hath been conclusively demonstrated, the return of  their chosen ones also is therefore definitely proven. This return is too  manifest in itself to require any evidence or proof. For instance,  consider that among the Prophets was Noah. When He was invested with the  robe of Prophethood, and was moved by the Spirit of God to arise and  proclaim His Cause, whoever believed in Him and acknowledged His Faith,  was endowed with the grace of a new life. Of him it could be truly said  that he was reborn and revived, inasmuch as previous to his belief in God  and his acceptance of His Manifestation, he had set his affections on the  things of the world, such as attachment to earthly goods, to wife,  children, food, drink, and the like, so much so that in the day-time and  in the night season his one concern had been to amass riches and procure  for himself the means of enjoyment and pleasure. Aside from these things,  before his partaking of the reviving waters of faith, he had been so  wedded to the traditions of his forefathers, and so passionately devoted  to the observance of their customs and laws, that he would have preferred  to suffer death rather than violate one letter of those superstitious  forms and manners current amongst his people. Even as the people have  cried: \"Verily we found our fathers with a faith, and verily, in their  footsteps we follow.\"(117)    These same people, though wrapt in all these veils of limitation, and  despite the restraint of such observances, as soon as they drank the  immortal draught of faith, from the cup of certitude, at the hand of the  Manifestation of the All-Glorious, were so transformed that they would  renounce for His sake their kindred, their substance, their lives, their  beliefs, yea, all else save God! So overpowering was their yearning for  God, so uplifting their transports of ecstatic delight, that the world and  all that is therein faded before their eyes into nothingness. Have not  this people exemplified the mysteries of \"rebirth\" and \"return\"? Hath it  not been witnessed that these same people, ere they were endued with the  new and wondrous grace of God, sought through innumerable devices, to  ensure the protection of their lives against destruction? Would not a  thorn fill them with terror, and the sight of a fox put them to flight?  But once having been honoured with God's supreme distinction, and having  been vouchsafed His bountiful grace, they would, if they were able, have  freely offered up ten thousand lives in His path! Nay, their blessed  souls, contemptuous of the cage of their bodies, would yearn for  deliverance. A single warrior of that host would face and fight a  multitude! And yet, how could they, but for the transformation wrought in  their lives, be capable of manifesting such deeds which are contrary to  the ways of men and incompatible with their worldly desires?    It is evident that nothing short of this mystic transformation could cause  such spirit and behaviour, so utterly unlike their previous habits and  manners, to be made manifest in the world of being. For their agitation  was turned into peace, their doubt into certitude, their timidity into  courage. Such is the potency of the Divine Elixir, which, swift as the  twinkling of an eye, transmuteth the souls of men!    For instance, consider the substance of copper. Were it to be protected in  its own mine from becoming solidified, it would, within the space of  seventy years, attain to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#18)"],[1,"might. Gather, then, together Thy  loved ones beneath the shadow of the Tree of Thy oneness, and of the  Manifestation of the effulgent light of Thy unity.    Thou art, verily, the One Whose power is immense, Whose vengeance is  terrible. No God is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.            LXXIV: \"MAGNIFIED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD, INASMUCH...\"      Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God, inasmuch as Thou hast inclined mine  ear to Thy voice, and called me to Thyself, and opened mine eyes to gaze  on Thy beauty, and illumined my heart with Thy knowledge, and sanctified  my breast from the doubts of the infidels in Thy days. I am the one, O my  God, who lay fast asleep on his couch, when lo, the messengers of Thy  manifold mercies were sent down upon me by Thee, and the gentle winds of  Thy loving-kindness blew over me, and roused me up, and caused me to set  my face towards the sanctuary of Thy knowledge, and to fix mine eyes upon  the splendors of the light of Thy face.    I am but a poor creature, O my Lord! Behold me clinging to the hem of Thy  riches. I have fled from darkness and from waywardness unto the brightness  of the light of Thy countenance. Were I--and to this Thy glory beareth me  witness--to render thanksgiving unto Thee, through the whole continuance of  Thy kingdom and the duration of the heaven of Thine omnipotence, I would  still have failed to repay Thy manifold bestowals.    I implore Thee, O my Lord, by Thy name, the Ever-Abiding, and by Thy name  which Thou didst ordain to be the most great Instrument binding Thee to  Thy servants, to grant that I may flee for shelter to Thy door, and speak  forth Thy praise. Write down, then, for me, in every world of Thine, that  which will enable me to enter beneath Thy shadow and within the borders of  Thy court.    Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful, the Most Exalted, the  Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.            LXXV: \"ALL-PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD, MY GOD! I KNOW...\"      All-praise be to Thee, O Lord, my God! I know not how to sing Thy praise,  how to describe Thy glory, how to call upon Thy Name. If I call upon Thee  by Thy Name, the All-Possessing, I am compelled to recognize that He Who  holdeth in His hand the immediate destinies of all created things is but a  vassal dependent upon Thee, and is the creation of but a word proceeding  from Thy mouth. And if I proclaim Thee by the name of Him Who is the  All-Compelling, I readily discover that He is but a suppliant fallen upon  the dust, awe-stricken by Thy dreadful might, Thy sovereignty and power.  And if I attempt to describe Thee by glorifying the oneness of Thy Being,  I soon realize that such a conception is but a notion which mine own fancy  hath woven, and that Thou hast ever been immeasurably exalted above the  vain imaginations which the hearts of men have devised.    The glory of Thy might beareth me witness! Whoso claimeth to have known  Thee hath, by virtue of such a claim, testified to his own ignorance; and  whoso believeth himself to have attained unto Thee, all the atoms of the  earth would attest his powerlessness and proclaim his failure. Thou hast,  however, by virtue of Thy mercy that hath surpassed the kingdoms of earth  and heaven, deigned to accept from Thy servants the laud and honor they  pay to Thine own exalted Self, and hast bidden them celebrate Thy glory,  that the ensigns of Thy guidance may be unfurled in Thy cities and the  tokens of Thy mercy be spread abroad among Thy nations, and that each and  all may be enabled to attain unto that which Thou hast destined for them  by Thy decree, and ordained unto them through Thine irrevocable will and  purpose.    Having testified, therefore, unto mine own impotence and the impotence of  Thy servants, I beseech Thee, by the brightness of the light of Thy  beauty, not to refuse Thy creatures attainment to the shores of Thy most  holy ocean. Draw them, then, O my God, through the Divine sweetness of Thy  melodies, towards the throne of Thy glory and the seat of Thine eternal  holiness. Thou art, verily, the Most Powerful, the Supreme Ruler, the  Great Giver, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Desired.    Grant, then, O my God, that Thy servant who hath turned towards Thee, hath  fixed his gaze upon Thee, and clung to the cord of Thy mercifulness and  favor, may be enabled to partake of the living waters of Thy mercy and  grace. Cause him, then, to ascend unto the heights to which he aspireth,  and withhold him not from that which Thou dost possess. Thou art, verily,  the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.            LXXVI: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! EVERY TIME I...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Every time I attempt to make mention of  Thee, I am hindered by the sublimity of Thy station and the overpowering  greatness of Thy might. For were I to praise Thee throughout the length of  Thy dominion and the duration of Thy sovereignty, I would find that my  praise of Thee can befit only such as are like unto me, who are themselves  Thy creatures, and who have been generated through the power of Thy decree  and been fashioned through the potency of Thy will. And at whatever time  my pen ascribeth glory to any one of Thy names, methinks I can hear the  voice of its lamentation in its remoteness from Thee, and can recognize  its cry because of its separation from Thy Self. I testify that everything  other than Thee is but Thy creation and is held in the hollow of Thy hand.  To have accepted any act or praise from Thy creatures is but an evidence  of the wonders of Thy grace and bountiful favors, and a manifestation of  Thy generosity and providence.    I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Most Great Name whereby Thou didst  separate light from fire, and truth from denial, to send down upon me and  upon such of my loved ones as are in my company the good of this world and  of the next. Supply us, then, with Thy wondrous gifts that are hid from  the eyes of men. Thou art, verily, the Fashioner of all creation. No God  is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most High.            LXXVII: \"O THOU, AT WHOSE DREADFUL MAJESTY ALL THINGS HAVE...\"      O Thou, at Whose dreadful majesty all things have trembled, in Whose grasp  are the affairs of all men, towards Whose grace and mercy are set the  faces of all Thy creatures! I entreat Thee, by Thy Name which Thou hast  ordained to be the spirit of all names that are in the kingdom of names,  to shield us from the whisperings of those who have turned away from Thee,  and have repudiated the truth of Thy most august and most exalted Self, in  this Revelation that hath caused the kingdom of Thy names to tremble.    I am one of Thy handmaidens, O my Lord! I have turned my face towards the  sanctuary of Thy gracious favors and the adored tabernacle of Thy glory.  Purify me of all that is not of Thee, and strengthen me to love Thee and  to fulfill Thy pleasure, that I may delight myself in the contemplation of  Thy beauty, and be rid of all attachment to any of Thy creatures, and may,  at every moment, proclaim: \"Magnified be God, the Lord of the worlds!\"    Let my food, O my Lord, be Thy beauty, and my drink the light of Thy  presence, and my hope Thy pleasure, and my work Thy praise, and my  companion Thy remembrance, and my aid Thy sovereignty, and my  dwelling-place Thy habitation, and my home the seat which Thou hast  exalted above the limitations of them that are shut out as by a veil from  Thee.    Thou art, in truth, the God of power, of strength and glory.            LXXVIII: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! EVERY TIME I...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Every time I am reminded of Thee and muse  on Thy virtues, I am seized with such ecstasies and am so enravished by  Thee that I find myself unable to make mention of Thy name and to extol  Thee. I am carried back to such heights that I recognize my self to be the  same as the remembrance of Thee in Thy realm, and the essence of Thy  praise among Thy servants. As long as that self endureth, so long will Thy  praise continue to be shed abroad among Thy creatures and Thy remembrance  glorified by Thy people.    Every man endued with insight among Thy servants is persuaded that my self  liveth eternally and can never perish, inasmuch as remembrance of Thee is  eternal and will endure so long as Thine own Self endureth, and Thy praise  is everlasting and will last as long as Thine own sovereignty will last.  By its means Thou art glorified by such of Thy chosen ones as call upon  Thee and by the sincere among Thy servants. Nay, the praise wherewith any  one, in the entire creation, praiseth Thee proceedeth from this exalted  self and returneth unto it, even as the sun which, while it shineth,  sheddeth its splendor upon whatsoever may be exposed to its rays. From  this sun is generated, and unto it must return, the light which is shed  over all things.    Exalted, immeasurably exalted art Thou above any attempt to measure the  greatness of Thy Cause, above any comparison that one may seek to make,  above the efforts of the human tongue to utter its import! From  everlasting Thou hast existed, alone with no one else beside Thee, and  wilt, to everlasting, continue to remain the same, in the sublimity of  Thine essence and the inaccessible heights of Thy glory.    And when Thou didst purpose to make Thyself known unto men, Thou didst  successively reveal the Manifestations of Thy Cause, and ordained each to  be a sign of Thy Revelation among Thy people, and the Day-Spring of Thine  invisible Self amidst Thy creatures, until the time when, as decreed by  Thee, all Thy previous Revelations culminated in Him Whom Thou hast  appointed as the Lord of all who are in the heaven of revelation and the  kingdom of creation, Him Whom Thou hast established as the Sovereign Lord  of all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. He it was Whom  Thou hast determined to be the "]]]
