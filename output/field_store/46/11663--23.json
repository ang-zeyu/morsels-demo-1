He  would have had to admit that the words \"High though his titles,  proud his name, boundless his wealth as wish can claim\" did not  apply to Jimmy Crocker. The latter may have been \"concentred all  on self,\" but his wealth consisted of one hundred and  thirty-three dollars and forty cents and his name was so far from  being proud that the mere sight of it in the files of the New  York _Sunday Chronicle_, the record-room of which he had just been  visiting, had made him consider the fact that he had changed it  to Bayliss the most sensible act of his career.    The reason for Jimmy's lack of enthusiasm as he surveyed the  portion of his native land visible from his doorway is not far to  seek. The _Atlantic_ had docked on Saturday night, and Jimmy,  having driven to an excellent hotel and engaged an expensive room  therein, had left instructions at the desk that breakfast should  be served to him at ten o'clock and with it the Sunday issue of  the _Chronicle_. Five years had passed since he had seen the dear  old rag for which he had reported so many fires, murders,  street-accidents, and weddings: and he looked forward to its  perusal as a formal taking _seisin_ of his long-neglected country.  Nothing could be more fitting and symbolic than that the first  morning of his return to America should find him propped up in  bed reading the good old _Chronicle_. Among his final meditations  as he dropped off to sleep was a gentle speculation as to who was  City editor now and whether the comic supplement was still  featuring the sprightly adventures of the Doughnut family.    A wave of not unmanly sentiment passed over him on the following  morning as he reached out for the paper. The sky-line of New  York, seen as the boat comes up the bay, has its points, and the  rattle of the Elevated trains and the quaint odour of the Subway  extend a kindly welcome, but the thing that really convinces the  returned traveller that he is back on Manhattan Island is the  first Sunday paper. Jimmy, like every one else, began by opening  the comic supplement: and as he scanned it a chilly discomfort,  almost a premonition of evil, came upon him. The Doughnut Family  was no more. He knew that it was unreasonable of him to feel as  if he had just been informed of the death of a dear friend, for  Pa Doughnut and his associates had been having their adventures  five years before he had left the country, and even the toughest  comic supplementary hero rarely endures for a decade: but  nevertheless the shadow did fall upon his morning optimism, and  he derived no pleasure whatever from the artificial rollickings  of a degraded creature called Old Pop Dill-Pickle who was offered  as a substitute.    But this, he was to discover almost immediately, was a trifling  disaster. It distressed him, but it did not affect his material  welfare. Tragedy really began when he turned to the magazine  section. Scarcely had he started to glance at it when this  headline struck him like a bullet:                PICCADILLY JIM AT IT AGAIN    And beneath it his own name.    Nothing is so capable of diversity as the emotion we feel on  seeing our name unexpectedly in print. We may soar to the heights  or we may sink to the depths. Jimmy did the latter. A mere  cursory first inspection of the article revealed the fact that it  was no eulogy. With an unsparing hand the writer had muck-raked  his eventful past, the text on which he hung his remarks being  that ill-fated encounter with Lord Percy Whipple at the Six  Hundred Club. This the scribe had recounted at a length and with  a boisterous vim which outdid even Bill Blake's effort in the  London _Daily Sun_. Bill Blake had been handicapped by  consideration of space and the fact that he had turned in his  copy at an advanced hour when the paper was almost made up. The  present writer was shackled by no restrictions. He had plenty of  room to spread himself in, and he had spread himself. So liberal  had been the editor's views in the respect that, in addition to  the letter-press, the pages contained an unspeakably offensive  picture of a burly young man in an obviously advanced condition  of alcoholism raising his fist to strike a monocled youth in  evening dress who had so little chin that Jimmy was surprised  that he had ever been able to hit it. The only gleam of  consolation that he could discover in this repellent drawing was  the fact that the artist had treated Lord Percy even more  scurvily than himself. Among other things, the second son of the  Duke of Devizes was depicted as wearing a coronet--a thing which  would have excited remark even in a London night-club.    Jimmy read the thing through in its entirety three times before  he appreciated a _nuance_ which his disordered mind had at first  failed to grasp--to wit, that this character-sketch of himself  was no mere isolated outburst but apparently one of a series. In  several places the writer alluded unmistakeably to other theses  on the same subject.    Jimmy's breakfast congealed on its tray, untouched. That boon  which the gods so seldom bestow, of seeing ourselves as others  see us, had been accorded to him in full measure. By the time he  had completed his third reading he was regarding himself in a  purely objective fashion not unlike the attitude of a naturalist  towards some strange and loathesome manifestation of insect life.  So this was the sort of fellow he was! He wondered they had let  him in at a reputable hotel.    The rest of the day he passed in a state of such humility that he  could have wept when the waiters were civil to him. On the Monday  morning he made his way to Park Row to read the files of the  _Chronicle_--a morbid enterprise, akin to the eccentric behaviour  of those priests of Baal who gashed themselves with knives or of  authors who subscribe to press-clipping agencies.    He came upon another of the articles almost at once, in an issue  not a month old. Then there was a gap of several weeks, and hope  revived that things might not be as bad as he had feared--only to  be crushed by another trenchant screed. After that he set about  his excavations methodically, resolved to know the worst. He  knew it in just under two hours. There it all was--his row with  the bookie, his bad behaviour at the political meeting, his  breach-of-promise case. It was a complete biography.    And the name they called him. Piccadilly Jim! Ugh!    He went out into Park Row, and sought a quiet doorway where he  could brood upon these matters.    It was not immediately that the practical or financial aspect of  the affair came to scourge him. For an appreciable time he  suffered in his self-esteem alone. It seemed to him that all  these bustling persons who passed knew him, that they were  casting sidelong glances at him and laughing derisively, that  those who chewed gum chewed it sneeringly and that those who ate  their cigars ate them with thinly-veiled disapproval and scorn.  Then, the passage of time blunting sensitiveness, he found that  there were other and weightier things to consider.    As far as he had had any connected plan of action in his sudden  casting-off of the flesh-pots of London, he had determined as  soon as possible after landing to report at the office of his old  paper and apply for his ancient position. So little thought had  he given to the minutiae of his future plans that it had not  occurred to him that he had anything to do but walk in, slap the  gang on the back, and announce that he was ready to work. Work!--on  the staff of a paper whose chief diversion appeared to be the  satirising of his escapades! Even had he possessed the moral  courage--or gall--to make the application, what good would it be?  He was a by-word in a world where he had once been a worthy  citizen. What paper would trust Piccadilly Jim with an  assignment? What paper would consider Piccadilly Jim even on  space rates? A chill dismay crept over him. He seemed to hear the  grave voice of Bayliss the butler speaking in his car as he had  spoken so short a while before at Paddington Station.    \"Is it not a little rash, Mr. James?\"    Rash was the word. Here he stood, in a country that had no  possible use for him, a country where competition was keen and  jobs for the unskilled infrequent. What on earth was there that  he could do?    Well, he could go home. . . . No, he couldn't. His pride revolted  at that solution. Prodigal Son stuff was all very well in its  way, but it lost its impressiveness if you turned up again at  home two weeks after you had left. A decent interval among the  husks and swine was essential. Besides, there was his father to  consider. He might be a poor specimen of a fellow, as witness the  _Sunday Chronicle_ _passim_, but he was not so poor as to come  slinking back to upset things for his father just when he had  done the only decent thing by removing himself. No, that was out  of the question.    What remained? The air of New York is bracing and healthy, but a  man cannot live on it. Obviously he must find a job. But what  job?    What could he do?    A gnawing sensation in the region of the waistcoat answered the  question. The solution--which it put forward was, it was true,  but a temporary one, yet it appealed strongly to Jimmy. He had  found it admirable at many crises. He would go and lunch, and it  might be that food would bring inspiration.    He moved from his doorway and crossed to the entrance of the  subway. He caught a timely express, and a few minutes later  emerged into the sunlight again at Grand Central. He made his way  westward along Forty-second Street to the hotel which he thought  would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#18)"],[1,"s,\" said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council,  \"there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives, to  which I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence happened  on the last two millennial commencements.  You will, of course, say  nothing of these trifles outside the Cabinet.\"    Raising his voice, he now summoned the guards.  \"Arrest the policemen;  gag them.  You know your duty.\"  After he had consigned to their fate  the wretched policemen--ill-fated and unwilling witnesses of a  State-secret which they were not to be permitted to reveal--he again  addressed the Counsellors.  \"My Lords, the business of the Council  being concluded, I have only to wish you a happy New Year.\"  Before  departing, he expressed, at some length, to the Clerk, my excellent but  most unfortunate brother, his sincere regret that, in accordance with  precedent and for the sake of secrecy, he must condemn him to perpetual  imprisonment, but added his satisfaction that, unless some mention were  made by him of that day's incident, his life would be spared.          Section 19.  How, though the Sphere shewed me other mysteries                 of Spaceland, I still desired more; and what came of it        When I saw my poor brother led away to imprisonment, I attempted to  leap down into the Council Chamber, desiring to intercede on his  behalf, or at least bid him farewell.  But I found that I had no motion  of my own.  I absolutely depended on the volition of my Guide, who said  in gloomy tones, \"Heed not thy brother; haply thou shalt have ample  time hereafter to condole with him.  Follow me.\"      [Illustration 10]    [ASCII approximation follows]               (1)                    (2)        __________             __________       |\\         |\\          |           \\       |  \\       |  \\        |             \\       |    \\ ____|____\\      |               \\       |     |    |     |     |                |       |_____|____|     |     |                |        \\    |     \\    |      \\               |          \\  |       \\  |        \\             |            \\|_________\\|          \\ __________|      Once more we ascended into space.  \"Hitherto,\" said the Sphere, \"I have  shewn you naught save Plane Figures and their interiors.  Now I must  introduce you to Solids, and reveal to you the plan upon which they are  constructed.  Behold this multitude of moveable square cards.  See, I  put one on another, not, as you supposed, Northward of the other, but  ON the other.  Now a second, now a third.  See, I am building up a  Solid by a multitude of Squares parallel to one another.  Now the Solid  is complete, being as high as it is long and broad, and we call it a  Cube.\"    \"Pardon me, my Lord,\" replied I; \"but to my eye the appearance is as of  an Irregular Figure whose inside is laid open to the view; in other  words, methinks I see no Solid, but a Plane such as we infer in  Flatland; only of an Irregularity which betokens some monstrous  criminal, so that the very sight of it is painful to my eyes.\"    \"True,\" said the Sphere, \"it appears to you a Plane, because you are  not accustomed to light and shade and perspective; just as in Flatland  a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of  Sight Recognition.  But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by  the sense of Feeling.\"    He then introduced me to the Cube, and I found that this marvellous  Being was indeed no Plane, but a Solid; and that he was endowed with  six plane sides and eight terminal points called solid angles; and I  remembered the saying of the Sphere that just such a Creature as this  would be formed by a Square moving, in Space, parallel to himself:  and  I rejoiced to think that so insignificant a Creature as I could in some  sense be called the Progenitor of so illustrious an offspring.    But still I could not fully understand the meaning of what my Teacher  had told me concerning \"light\" and \"shade\" and \"perspective\"; and I did  not hesitate to put my difficulties before him.    Were I to give the Sphere's explanation of these matters, succinct and  clear though it was, it would be tedious to an inhabitant of Space, who  knows these things already.  Suffice it, that by his lucid statements,  and by changing the position of objects and lights, and by allowing me  to feel the several objects and even his own sacred Person, he at last  made all things clear to me, so that I could now readily distinguish  between a Circle and a Sphere, a Plane Figure and a Solid.    This was the Climax, the Paradise, of my strange eventful History.  Henceforth I have to relate the story of my miserable Fall:--most  miserable, yet surely most undeserved!  For why should the thirst for  knowledge be aroused, only to be disappointed and punished?  My  volition shrinks from the painful task of recalling my humiliation;  yet, like a second Prometheus, I will endure this and worse, if by any  means I may arouse in the interiors of Plane and Solid Humanity a  spirit of rebellion against the Conceit which would limit our  Dimensions to Two or Three or any number short of Infinity.  Away then  with all personal considerations!  Let me continue to the end, as I  began, without further digressions or anticipations, pursuing the plain  path of dispassionate History.  The exact facts, the exact words,--and  they are burnt in upon my brain,--shall be set down without alteration  of an iota; and let my Readers judge between me and Destiny.    The Sphere would willingly have continued his lessons by indoctrinating  me in the conformation of all regular Solids, Cylinders, Cones,  Pyramids, Pentahedrons, Hexahedrons, Dodecahedrons, and Spheres:  but I  ventured to interrupt him.  Not that I was wearied of knowledge.  On  the contrary, I thirsted for yet deeper and fuller draughts than he was  offering to me.    \"Pardon me,\" said I, \"O Thou Whom I must no longer address as the  Perfection of all Beauty; but let me beg thee to vouchsafe thy servant  a sight of thine interior.\"    SPHERE.  My what?    I.  Thine interior:  thy stomach, thy intestines.    SPHERE.  Whence this ill-timed impertinent request?  And what mean you  by saying that I am no longer the Perfection of all Beauty?    I.  My Lord, your own wisdom has taught me to aspire to One even more  great, more beautiful, and more closely approximate to Perfection than  yourself.  As you yourself, superior to all Flatland forms, combine  many Circles in One, so doubtless there is One above you who combines  many Spheres in One Supreme Existence, surpassing even the Solids of  Spaceland.  And even as we, who are now in Space, look down on Flatland  and see the insides of all things, so of a certainty there is yet above  us some higher, purer region, whither thou dost surely purpose to lead  me--O Thou Whom I shall always call, everywhere and in all Dimensions,  my Priest, Philosopher, and Friend--some yet more spacious Space, some  more dimensionable Dimensionality, from the vantage-ground of which we  shall look down together upon the revealed insides of Solid things, and  where thine own intestines, and those of thy kindred Spheres, will lie  exposed to the view of the poor wandering exile from Flatland, to whom  so much has already been vouchsafed.    SPHERE.  Pooh!  Stuff!  Enough of this trifling!  The time is short,  and much remains to be done before you are fit to proclaim the Gospel  of Three Dimensions to your blind benighted countrymen in Flatland.    I.  Nay, gracious Teacher, deny me not what I know it is in thy power  to perform.  Grant me but one glimpse of thine interior, and I am  satisfied for ever, remaining henceforth thy docile pupil, thy  unemancipable slave, ready to receive all thy teachings and to feed  upon the words that fall from thy lips.    SPHERE.  Well, then, to content and silence you, let me say at once, I  would shew you what you wish if I could; but I cannot.  Would you have  me turn my stomach inside out to oblige you?    I.  But my Lord has shewn me the intestines of all my countrymen in the  Land of Two Dimensions by taking me with him into the Land of Three.  What therefore more easy than now to take his servant on a second  journey into the blessed region of the Fourth Dimension, where I shall  look down with him once more upon this land of Three Dimensions, and  see the inside of every three-dimensioned house, the secrets of the  solid earth, the treasures of the mines in Spaceland, and the  intestines of every solid living creature, even of the noble and  adorable Spheres.    SPHERE.  But where is this land of Four Dimensions?    I.  I know not:  but doubtless my Teacher knows.    SPHERE.  Not I.  There is no such land.  The very idea of it is utterly  inconceivable.    I.  Not inconceivable, my Lord, to me, and therefore still less  inconceivable to my Master.  Nay, I despair not that, even here, in  this region of Three Dimensions, your Lordship's art may make the  Fourth Dimension visible to me; just as in the Land of Two Dimensions  my Teacher's skill would fain have opened the eyes of his blind servant  to the invisible presence of a Third Dimension, though I saw it not.    Let me recall the past.  Was I not taught below that when I saw a Line  and inferred a Plane, I in reality saw a Third unrecognized Dimension,  not the same as brightness, called \"height\"?  And does it not now  follow that, in this region, when I see a Plane and infer a Solid, I  really see a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, not the same as colour, but  existent, though infinitesimal and incapable of measurement?    And besides this, there is the Argument from Analogy of Figures.    SPHERE.  Analogy!  Nonsense:  what analogy?    I.  Your Lordship tempts his servant to see whether he remembers the  revelations imparted to him.  Trifle not with me, my Lord; I crave, I  thirst, for more knowledge.  Doubtless we cannot SEE that other higher  Spaceland now, because"]]]
