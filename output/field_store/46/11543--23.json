Remove the stones and fill the centres with a mixture of chopped  nuts and ginger. Roll in granulated sugar. Prunes may be filled with  fondant or fudge.      PRUNE CHARLOTTE    Soak three level tablespoons of gelatine in one-half cup of cold water  for one-half hour. Then set in hot water bath to melt. Strain into a  bowl and add      One cup of prune juice,    Juice of one lemon,    One-half cup of sugar.    Heat to dissolve sugar and then cool before adding to the gelatine.  Now place a few spoonfuls of the prepared gelatine mixture in a mould  and turn to thoroughly coat the mould. Then line the mould with cooked  and stoned prunes. Pour a few spoonfuls of the gelatine mixture over  the prunes and set them in place before pouring in the remainder of  the mixture; then set aside to mould. When ready to serve unmould on  platter and serve with prune sauce.      PRUNE SAUCE    Rub one cup of cooked and stoned prunes through a fine sieve and add      One cup of prune juice,    Juice of one lemon,    Six tablespoons of sugar.    Heat to dissolve sugar and then cool before serving.      RHUBARB    To cook rhubarb, cut it into inch pieces and remove the stringy peel.  Cook in a glass or earthen casserole dish in the oven until it is  soft, adding just enough sugar to sweeten. This will give you a  splendid product.    Do not use the leaves of the rhubarb. And do not cook rhubarb in tin;  the mineral salt or acid content of the fruit reacts upon the metal  and sets up an active poison.      TO COOK RHUBARB FOR PIES    Prepare the rhubarb and then sprinkle well with flour and add sugar,  and cook slowly until tender. The flour will thicken the mixture.  Then pour into the prepared pie plate and cover with pastry. Bake in  a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Pie made in this way will be far  superior to that made where the rhubarb is cut and placed in the pie  and then cooked.      RHUBARB AND RAISIN CONSERVE    Wash and peel and then cut the rhubarb into one-half inch pieces.  Measure one quart of the cut pieces and place in a baking dish, adding      One cup of seeded raisins,    Two cups of sugar.    Do not add water; cover and cook until the fruit is tender, usually  about forty minutes.      RHUBARB FRUIT SAUCE    Place the whites of two eggs in a bowl and then add one-half glass  of jelly. Beat until very stiff and then add one cup of very thick  rhubarb sauce.      RHUBARB SHORTCAKE    Place two cups of flour in a bowl and add      One teaspoon of salt,    Four teaspoons of baking powder,    One-half cup of sugar.    Sift to mix and then rub in six tablespoons of shortening. Mix to a  dough with two-thirds cup of milk. Cut with a large cookie cutter and  then bake in a hot oven for fifteen minutes. Split and butter, and  then fill with the cooked rhubarb and serve with either plain or  whipped cream or custard sauce.      RHUBARB COCKTAIL    Place three tablespoons of rhubarb conserve in a cocktail glass. Add  layer of thinly sliced bananas and then a layer of shredded orange.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and top with whipped cream or stiffly  beaten white of egg. Garnish with maraschino cherries.      RHUBARB PUFFS      Three-quarters cup of sugar,    One-half cup of water,    Five tablespoons of shortening.    Place in a bowl and then add      One egg,    Two cups of flour,    Four teaspoons of baking powder,    One-half teaspoon of salt,    One cup of finely chopped rhubarb (raw).    Beat to mix and then fill into well-greased custard cups and bake for  thirty minutes in a hot oven.      VERMONT RHUBARB GRIDDLE CAKES    Soak stale bread in cold water to soften. Press very dry and then rub  through a fine sieve. Now measure two cups and place in a bowl and add      One and one-half cups of sweetened rhubarb,    One egg,    One and three-quarters cups of sifted flour,    Four teaspoons of baking powder,    One teaspoon of salt,    One tablespoon of shortening.    Mix well and then bake on a griddle and serve with sugar, cinnamon and  butter or syrup.      RHUBARB GELATINE      Two cups of cold, cooked and sweetened rhubarb.    Add      Four level tablespoons of gelatine,    Juice of one orange,    One-half cup of water.    Add the gelatine to the mixture and then set aside for one-half hour  to soften. Then heat slowly until the boiling point is reached,  remove from the fire and pour into moulds. Let set until firm and  then unmould and serve with whipped cream. Use a china or earthenware  mould.      RHUBARB AND TAPIOCA PUDDING    Wash one-half cup of pearl tapioca in plenty of water to remove the  starch. Place in a glass or earthenware baking dish and add four cups  of cooked and sweetened rhubarb. Cook in the oven until the tapioca is  transparent or soft. Place a meringue made of the white of one egg on  top. Cool, and then serve.      RHUBARB DUMPLINGS    Roll the pastry out one-quarter inch thick and then cut into four-inch  squares. Fill with pieces of rhubarb cut in one-half inch pieces,  adding 2 tablespoons sugar. Fold the dough over, pressing it tightly,  and then brush with egg-wash and bake in a slow oven for thirty  minutes.      GINGER JELLY    Soak one-half package of gelatine in one cupful of cold water for  thirty minutes and then add      Juice of one lemon,    One orange,    One-half cup of sugar,    One cup of boiling water.    Beat thoroughly to mix and then let cool. Just before it begins to  thicken stir in one-half cup of finely chopped candied ginger.    GINGER CREAM    Soak one-half box of gelatine in one and one-half cups of cold milk  for one-half hour. Now add one-half cup of sugar and set in a pan of  warm water. Stir until gelatine is dissolved and then set aside to  cool. While cooling place      White of one egg,    One-half glass of jelly    in a bowl and beat with a Dover egg-beater until light and fluffy.  Add one-half cup of finely shredded candied ginger and then cooled  gelatine. Whip until it begins to thicken and then pour into moulds to  become firm.    NOTE.--Do not add the gelatine mixture to the fruit whip until just  before it thickens.      GINGER DELICACIES    The West Indians make and serve many delicious desserts and conserves  made with ginger. Either the prepared ginger in pots may be used or  the ordinary ginger root may be obtained from the grocery shops. Ask  for stem ginger, as this kind is less apt to be stringy and coarse.    To prepare: Soak the ginger in warm water over night and then in the  morning wash, using a vegetable brush. Now scrape well and then place  in fresh water enough to cover--and cook gently on the back of the  stove until tender. Or it may be placed in the fireless cooker over  night. When the root is tender, place      Three cupfuls of sugar,    Three-quarters cup of water,    Juice of one lemon    in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook for ten minutes and then add  the ginger. Now place where it will just keep warm and simmer until  the syrup is absorbed. Remove and stand in a cool place for two  days. Reheat and then drain on a sieve and roll in sugar. Pack in an  air-tight tin box and the ginger will keep indefinitely.      PINEAPPLE MOUSSE    Drain and mince sufficient pineapple fine to measure two cups. Put  through a fine sieve and then place in a bowl; place whites of two  eggs in a second bowl and add one glass of apple jelly. Beat until  very stiff. Whip one cup of cream stiff and add one-half cup of sugar.  Gently combine the fruit whip, whipped cream and puree of pineapple  by cutting and folding until well mixed. Pour into two-quart mould and  cover with wax paper; then place on the lid, and use one pint of salt  to two and one-half pints of finely crushed ice, to set the mousse to  freeze.      TO STUFF DATES WITH GINGER    Remove the stones from the dates and then fill the centre With a piece  of candied ginger. Press firmly and then roll between the hands to  restore to shape of date. Roll the finished date in granulated sugar.  Prunes may be used to replace the dates.      EGGLESS MAYONNAISE    Place in soup plate      Two tablespoons evaporated milk,    One-half teaspoon mustard,    One-half teaspoon paprika.    Blend by beating with fork and when smooth add slowly three-quarters  cup of salad oil. Beat hard for few minutes. Now add      One teaspoon sugar,    One teaspoon salt,    One teaspoon vinegar.    Then beat again until thoroughly mixed.      COOKED SALAD DRESSING      One-half cup of vinegar,    Three-quarters cup of water,    Three level tablespoons of cornstarch.    Dissolve the starch in the water and add the vinegar and bring to a  boil. Cook for three minutes and then remove, and add      One egg,    One teaspoon of salt,    One teaspoon of paprika,    Three-quarters teaspoon of mustard,    One teaspoon of sugar.    Beat to mix and then beat in one cup of sour cream. This dressing may  be used on potatoes, chicken and celery salad and with cold meat or  plain lettuce.      FROZEN LEMON CUSTARD    Place in a saucepan      One quart of milk,    One-half cup of cornstarch.    Stir until dissolved and then bring to a boil. Cook for ten minutes.  Remove from the fire and add      Three well-beaten eggs.    Beat to thoroughly mix, then cool. Now grate the rind lightly from one  lemon. Place in a bowl and add      Juice of three lemons,    Juice of one orange,    One and one-half cups of sugar.    Blend well and when ready to freeze beat the lemon mixture into  the custard. Add the lemon mixture very slowly. Freeze in the usual  manner, using three parts of ice to one of salt. Pack, and then set  aside for two hours to ripen.      GINGER-ALE SALAD    Soak four tablespoons of gelatine in four tablespoons of cold water  for twenty minutes. Now add to the gelatine one-half cup of boiling  ginger-ale. Stir until gelatine is dissolved and then strain. Add the  balance of the one pint bottle of ginger-ale. Let cool, and then rinse  off mould in ice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17451"],[0,"Sign Language Among North American Indians Compared With That Among Other (#18)"],[1,"was brushed toward the right over that of  the left (_nothing_), and the right hand made to grasp the palm of  the left, thumbs extended over and lying upon the back of the opposing  hand.    This was readily understood by the deaf-mutes.    Deaf-mute sign of milking a cow and drinking the milk was fully and  quickly understood.    The narrative of a boy going to an apple-tree, hunting for ripe fruit  and filling his pockets, being surprised by the owner and hit upon the  head with a stone, was much appreciated by the Indians and completely  understood.    A deaf-mute asked Alejandro how long it took him to come to Washington  from his country. He replied by placing the index and second finger of  the right hand astride the extended forefinger (others closed) of the  left; then elevating the fingers of the left hand (except thumb and  forefinger) back forward (_three_); then extending the fingers of both  hands and bringing them to a point, thumbs resting on palmar sides and  extended, placing the hands in front of the body, the tips opposite  the opposing wrist, and about four inches apart; then, revolving them  in imitation of _wheels_, he elevated the extended forefinger of  the left hand (_one_); then placing the extended flat hands, thumbs  touching, the backs sloping downward towards the respective right  and left sides, like the roof of a house; then repeating the sign of  wheels as in the preceding, after which the left hand was extended  before the body, fingers toward the right, horizontal, palm down and  slightly arched, the right wrist held under it, the fingers extending  upward beyond it, and quickly and repeatedly snapped upward (_smoke_);  the last three signs being _covered--wagon--smoke_, i.e., _cars_; then  elevating four fingers of the left hand (_four_).    _Translation_.--Traveled three days on horseback, one in a wagon, and  four in the cars.    The deaf-mutes understood all but the sign for wheel, which they make  as a large circle, with _one_ hand.    Another example: A deaf-mute pretended to hunt something; found birds,  took his bow and arrows and killed several.    This was fully understood.    A narrative given by Alejandro was also understood by the deaf-mutes,  to the effect that he made search for deer, shot one with a gun,  killed and skinned it, and packed it up.    It will be observed that many of the above signs admitted of and were  expressed by pantomime, yet that was not the case with all that were  made. President GALLAUDET made also some remarks in gesture which were  understood by the Indians, yet were not strictly pantomimic.    The opinion of all present at the test was that two intelligent mimes  would seldom fail of mutual understanding, their attention being  exclusively directed to the expression of thoughts by the means of  comprehension and reply equally possessed by both, without the mental  confusion of conventional sounds only intelligible to one.    A large collection has been made of natural deaf-mute signs, and also  of those more conventional, which have been collated with those of the  several tribes of Indians. Many of them show marked similarity, not  only in principle but often in detail.           *       *       *       *       *    The result of the studies so far as prosecuted is that what is  called _the_ sign language of Indians is not, properly speaking, one  language, but that it and the gesture systems of deaf-mutes and of  all peoples constitute together one language--the gesture speech of  mankind--of which each system is a dialect.        _TO WHAT EXTENT PREVALENT AS A SYSTEM._    The assertion has been made by many writers, and is currently repeated  by Indian traders and some Army officers, that all the tribes of North  America have long had and still use a _common_ and _identical_  sign language, in which they can communicate freely without oral  assistance. Although this remarkable statement is at variance with  some of the principles of the formation and use of signs set forth  by Dr. E.B. TYLOR, whose admirable chapters on gesture speech in his  _Researches into the Early History of Mankind_ have in a great degree  prompted the present inquiries, that eminent authority did not see fit  to discredit it. He repeats the report as he received it, in the words  that \"the same signs serve as a medium of converse from Hudson Bay to  the Gulf of Mexico.\" Its truth or falsity can only be established by  careful comparison of lists or vocabularies of signs taken under test  conditions at widely different times and places. For this purpose  lists have been collated by the writer, taken in different parts of  the country at several dates, from the last century to the last month,  comprising together several thousand signs, many of them, however,  being mere variants or synonyms for the same object or quality, some  being repetitions of others and some of small value from uncertainty  in description or authority, or both.      ONCE PROBABLY UNIVERSAL IN NORTH AMERICA.    The conclusion reached from the researches made is to the effect  that before the changes wrought by the Columbian discovery the use of  gesture illustrated the remark of Quintilian upon the same subject  (l. xi, c. 3) that \"_In tanta per omnes gentes nationesque linguae  diversitate hic mihi omnium hominum communis sermo videatur._\"    Quotations may be taken from some old authorities referring to widely  separated regions. The Indians of Tampa Bay, identified with the  Timucua, met by Cabeca de Vaca in 1528, were active in the use of  signs, and in his journeying for eight subsequent years, probably  through Texas and Mexico, he remarks that he passed through many  dissimilar tongues, but that he questioned and received the answers  of the Indians by signs \"just as if they spoke our language and we  theirs.\" Michaelius, writing in 1628, says of the Algonkins on or near  the Hudson River: \"For purposes of trading as much was done by signs  with the thumb and fingers as by speaking.\" In Bossu's _Travels  through that part of North America formerly called Louisiana_,  _London_, 1771 (Forster's translation), an account is given of  Monsieur de Belle-Isle some years previously captured by the Atak-apa,  who remained with them two years and \"conversed in their pantomimes  with them.\" He was rescued by Governor Bienville and was sufficiently  expert in the sign language to interpret between Bienville and the  tribe. In Bushmann's _Spuren_, p. 424, there is a reference to the  \"Accocessaws on the west side of the Colorado, two hundred miles  southwest of Nacogdoches,\" who use thumb signs which they understand:  \"_Theilen sich aber auch durch Daum-Zeichen mit, die sie alle  verstehen._\"    Omitting many authorities, and for brevity allowing a break in the  continuity of time, reference may be made to the statement in Major  Long's expedition of 1819, concerning the Arapahos, Kaiowas, Ietans,  and Cheyennes, to the effect that, being ignorant of each other's  languages, many of them when they met would communicate by means  of signs, and would thus maintain a conversation without the least  difficulty or interruption. A list of the tribes reported upon by  Prince Maximilian von Wied-Neuweid, in 1832-'34, appears elsewhere  in this paper. In Fremont's expedition of 1844 special and repeated  allusion is made to the expertness of the Pai-Utes in signs, which is  contradictory to the statement above made by correspondents. The same  is mentioned regarding a band of Shoshonis met near the summit of the  Sierra Nevada, and one of \"Diggers,\" probably Chemehuevas, encountered  on a tributary of the Rio Virgen.    Ruxton, in his _Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains_, _New  York_, 1848, p. 278, sums up his experience with regard to the Western  tribes so well as to require quotation: \"The language of signs is  so perfectly understood in the Western country, and the Indians  themselves are such admirable pantomimists, that, after a little use,  no difficulty whatever exists in carrying on a conversation by such  a channel; and there are few mountain men who are at a loss in  thoroughly understanding and making themselves intelligible by signs  alone, although they neither speak nor understand a word of the Indian  tongue.\"    Passing to the correspondents of the writer from remote parts of  North America, it is important to notice that Mr. J.W. Powell, Indian  superintendent, reports the use of sign language among the Kutine,  and Mr. James Lenihan, Indian agent, among the Selish, both tribes  of British Columbia. The Very Rev. Edward Jacker, while contributing  information upon the present use of gesture language among the Ojibwas  of Lake Superior, mentions that it has fallen into comparative neglect  because for three generations they had not been in contact with  tribes of a different speech. Dr. Francis H. Atkins, acting assistant  surgeon, United States Army, in forwarding a contribution of signs  of the Mescalero Apaches remarks: \"I think it probable that they have  used sign language rather less than many other Indians. They do not  seem to use it to any extent at home, and abroad the only tribes they  were likely to come into contact with were the Navajos, the Lipans  of old Mexico, and the Comanches. Probably the last have been almost  alone their visiting neighbors. They have also seen the Pueblos  a little, these appearing to be, like the Phoenicians of old, the  traders of this region.\" He also alludes to the effect of the Spanish,  or rather _lingua Mexicana_, upon all the Southern tribes and, indeed,  upon those as far north as the Utes, by which recourse to signs is now  rendered less necessary.    Before leaving this particular topic it is proper to admit that, while  there is not only recorded testimony to the past use of gesture  signs by several tribes of the Iroquoian and Algonkian families, but  evidence that it still remains, it is, however, noticeable that"]]]
