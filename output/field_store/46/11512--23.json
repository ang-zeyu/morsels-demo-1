In 1897 was celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the Queen's reign,  and every colony sent a detachment of troops to represent it. At the  steps of St Paul's Cathedral the Queen remained to return thanks to  God for all the blessings of her reign, and after the magnificent  procession had returned she once again sent a message to her people:    \"In weal and woe I have ever had the true sympathy of all my people,  which has been warmly reciprocated by myself. It has given me  unbounded pleasure to see so many of my subjects from all parts of  the world assembled here, and to find them joining in the  acclamations of loyal devotion to myself, and I wish to thank them  all from the depth of my grateful heart.\"          _Appendix to Chapter XIII_      THE BRITISH EMPIRE    The population of the Empire is estimated to be 355 millions of  coloured and 60 millions of white people.      CANADA    1840. The Act of Union passed. The two colonies of Upper and Lower  Canada united, and a representative Assembly formed.    1867. Bill for the Federation of Canada passed. The various provinces  united under the title of Dominion of Canada, ruled by a  Governor-General, nominated by the Crown. The Central Parliament,  which dealt with matters relating to the Dominion, established at  Ottawa.    1885. Completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which led to the  opening up of the North-West. The great stream of emigration from  Europe commences.      AUSTRALIA    Australia became a United Commonwealth at the beginning of the  present century.    From 1851 onward the transportation of convicts was prohibited.    The expansion of the Commonwealth has taken place to a great extent  during the reign of Queen Victoria. The majority of the settlers are  of British descent.      SOUTH AFRICA    South Africa finally united in 1910 with self-government.      INDIA    Disraeli, in 1876, introduced the Royal Titles Bill, by means of  which the Queen was able to assume the title of Empress of India.          CHAPTER XIV: _Stress and Strain_        Forward, forward let us range,  Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.                                     TENNYSON      The greatest Revolutions are not always those which are accompanied  by riot and bloodshed. England's Revolution was peaceful, but it  worked vast and almost incredible changes.    We find, in the first place, that after the great Napoleonic Wars  and during the 'forty years' peace' a new class, the 'Middle Class,'  came into being. It had, of course, existed before this time, but  it had been unable to make its power felt. The astonishing increase  of trade and consequently of wealth, the application of steam power  with special influence upon land and sea transit, transformed  England into \"the Workshop of the World.\"    By the year 1840 railways were no longer regarded as something in  the nature of an experiment, which might or might not prove  a success; they had, indeed, become an integral part of the social  life of the nation. In 1840 the Railway Regulation Act was passed,  followed in 1844 by the Cheap Trains Act, which required that  passengers must be carried in covered waggons at a charge of not more  than one penny a mile and at a speed of not less than twelve miles  an hour.    From 1844 onward the construction of railways proceeded apace, until  by the year 1874 no less than 16,449 miles had been laid. Ocean  traffic under steam progressed equally rapidly; in 1812 the first  steamer appeared upon the Clyde, and in 1838 the famous _Great  Western_ steamed from Bristol to New York.    The quickening and cheapening of transport called for new and  improved methods of manufacture; small business concerns grew into  great mercantile houses with interests all over the face of the globe.  Everywhere movement and expansion; everywhere change. A powerful  commercial class came into existence, and power--that is, voting  power--passed to this class and was held by it until the year 1865.  From this year, roughly speaking, the power passed into the hands  of the democracy.    Education, which had been to a great extent a class monopoly,  gradually penetrated to all ranks and grades of society. In 1867 the  second Reform Act was passed; a very large proportion of the urban  working classes were given the power of voting, and it was naturally  impossible to entrust such powers for long to an illiterate democracy.  Therefore, in 1870, Mr Forster's Education Act was passed, which  required that in every district where sufficient voluntary schools  did not exist a School Board should be formed to build and maintain  the necessary school accommodation at the cost of the rates. By a  later Act of 1876 school attendance was made compulsory. Every effort  was made in succeeding years to raise the level of intelligence among  present and future citizens. Education became national and  universal.    During the period 1865-85 the population of the kingdom increased,  and the emigration to the British colonial possessions reached its  maximum in the year 1883, when the figures were 183,236.    The rapid rise in population of the large towns drew attention more  and more urgently to the question of public health. Every city and  every town had its own problems to face, and the necessity for solving  these cultivated and strengthened the sense of civic pride and  responsibility. We find during this period an ever-growing interest  throughout the country in the welfare, both moral and mental, of the  great mass of the workers. Municipal life became the training-ground  where many a member of Parliament served his apprenticeship.    Municipalities took charge of baths and washhouses, organized and  built public markets, ensured a cheap and ample supply of pure water,  installed modern systems of drainage, provided housing  accommodation at low rents for the poorer classes, built hospitals  for infectious diseases, and, finally, carried on the great and  important work of educating its citizens.    The power of Labour began, at last, to make itself felt. The first  attempt at co-operation made by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844  stimulated others to follow their example, and in 1869 the  Co-operative Union was formed. The Trade Unions showed an increased  interest in education, in forming libraries and classes, and in  extending their somewhat narrow policy as their voting power  increased. Out of this movement sprang Working Men's Clubs attached  to the Unions and carrying on all branches of work, educational and  beneficial, amongst its members.    The standard of society was continually rising, and it was already  a far cry to the Early Victorian England described in an earlier  chapter.    The world was growing smaller--that is to say, communications  between country and country, between continent and continent, were  growing more easy. The first insulated cable was laid in 1848, across  the Hudson River, from Jersey City to New York, and in 1857  an unsuccessful attempt was made to connect the New and the Old World.  In 1866 the _Great Eastern_, after two trials, succeeded in laying  a complete cable. The expansion of the powers of human invention led  to a great increase in the growth of comfort of all classes. To take  only a few striking examples: at the beginning of the century matches  were not yet invented, and only in 1827 were the 'Congreve' sulphur  matches put on the market; they were sold at the rate of one shilling  a box containing eighty-four matches! In the year 1821 gas was still  considered a luxury; soap and candles were both greatly improved and  cheapened. By the withdrawal of the window tax in 1851 obvious and  necessary advantages were gained in the building of houses.    In 1855 the stamp duty on newspapers was abolished. In these days  of cheap halfpenny papers with immense circulations it is difficult  to realize that at a date not very far distant from us, the poor  scarcely, if ever, saw a newspaper at all. Friends used to club  together to reduce the great expense of buying a single copy, and  agents hired out copies for the sum of one penny per hour. The only  effect of the stamp duty had been to cut off the poorer classes from  all sources of trustworthy information.    In 1834 not a single town in the kingdom with the exception of London  possessed a daily paper. The invention of steam printing, and the  introduction of shorthand reporting and the use of telegraph and  railways, revolutionized the whole world of journalism.    Charles Dickens, on the occasion of his presiding, in May 1865, at  the second annual dinner of the Newspaper Press Fund, gave his  hearers an idea of what newspaper reporters were and what they  suffered in the early days. \"I have pursued the calling of a reporter  under circumstances of which many of my brethren here can form no  adequate conception. I have often transcribed for the printer, from  my shorthand notes, important public speeches in which the strictest  accuracy was required, and a mistake in which would have been to a  young man severely compromising, writing on the palm of my hand, by  the light of a dark lantern, in a post-chaise and four, galloping  through a wild country, and through the dead of the night, at the  then surprising rate of fifteen miles an hour. . . . I have worn my  knees by writing on them on the old back-row of the old gallery of  the old House of Commons; and I have worn my feet by standing to write  in a preposterous pen in the old House of Lords, where we used to  be huddled together like so many sheep--kept in waiting, say, until  the woolsack might want re-stu"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#18)"],[1,"emorial? Where can you find young redwoods growing more thriftily  than among their giant ancestors, nearly or quite as old as the  Christian era?    The question why the original growth is not reproduced can best be  answered by some illustrations. When a pine forest is burned over,  both trees and seeds are destroyed, and as the burned trees cannot  sprout from the stump like oaks and many other trees, the land is left  in a condition well suited for the germination of tree seeds, but  there are no seeds to germinate. It is an open field for pioneers to  enter, and the seeds which arrive there first have the right of  possession. The aspen poplar (_Populus tremuloides_) has the advantage  over all other trees. It is a native of all our northern forests, from  the Atlantic to the Pacific. Even fires cannot eradicate it, as it  grows in moist as well as dry places, and sprouts from any part of the  root. It is a short-lived tree, consequently it seeds when quite young  and seeds abundantly; the seeds are light, almost infinitesimal, and  are carried on wings of down. Its seeds ripen in spring, and are  carried to great distances at the very time when the ground is in the  best condition for them. Even on the dry mountain sides in Colorado,  the snows are just melting and the ground is moist where they fall.    To grow this tree from seed would require the greatest skill of the  nurseryman, but the burnt land is its paradise. Wherever you see it on  high, dry land you may rest assured that a fire has been there. On  land slides you will not find its seeds germinating, although they  have been deposited there as abundantly as on the burned land.    Next to the aspen and poplars comes the canoe birch, and further north  the yellow birch, and such other trees as have provision for  scattering their seeds. I have seen acorns and nuts germinating in  clusters on burned lands in a few instances. They had evidently been  buried there by animals and had escaped the fires. I have seen the red  cherry (_Prunus Pennsylvanica_) coming up in great quantities where  they might never have germinated had not the fires destroyed the  debris which covered the seed too deeply.    A careful examination around the margin of a burned forest will show  the trees of surrounding kinds working in again. Thus by the time the  short-lived aspens (and they are very short-lived on high land) have  made a covering on the burned land, the surrounding kinds will be  found re-established in the new forest, the seeds of the conifers,  carried in by the winds, the berries by the birds, the nuts and acorns  by the squirrels, the mixture varying more or less from the kinds  which grew there before the fire.    It is wonderful how far the seeds of berries are carried by birds. The  waxwings and cedar birds carry seeds of our tartarean honeysuckles,  purple barberries and many other kinds four miles distant, where we  see them spring up on the lake shore, where these birds fly in flocks  to feed on the juniper berries. It seems to be the same everywhere. I  found European mountain ash trees last summer in a forest in New  Hampshire; the seed must have been carried over two miles as the crow  flies.    While this alternation is going on in the East, and may have been  going on for thousands of years, the Rocky Mountain district is not so  fortunate. When a forest is burned down in that dry region, it is  doubtful if coniferous trees will ever grow again, except in some  localities specially favored. I have seen localities where short-lived  trees were dying out and no others taking their places. Such spots  will hereafter take their places above the timber line, which seems to  me to be a line governed by circumstances more than by altitude or  quality of soil.    There are a few exceptions where pines will succeed pines in a  burned-down forest. _Pinus Murrayana_ grows up near the timber line in  the Rocky Mountains. This tree has persistent cones which adhere to  the trees for many years. I have counted the cones of sixteen years on  one of these trees, and examined burned forests of this species, where  many of the cones had apparently been bedded in the earth as the trees  fell. The heat had opened the cones and the seedlings were growing up  in myriads; but not a conifer of any other kind could be seen as far  as the fire had reached.    In the Michigan Peninsula, northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, _P.  Banksiana_, a comparatively worthless tree, is replacing the valuable  red pine (_P. resinosa_), and in the Sierras _P. Murrayana_ and _P.  tuberculata_ are replacing the more valuable species by the same  process.    In this case, also, the worthless trees are the shortest lived. So we  see that nature is doing all that she can to remedy the evil. Man only  is reckless, and especially the American man. The Mexican will cut  large limbs off his trees for fuel, but will spare the tree. Even the  poor Indian, when at the starvation point, stripping the bark from the  yellow pine (_P. ponderosa_), for the mucilaginous matter being formed  into sap wood, will never take a strip wider than one third the  circumference of the tree, so that its growth may not be injured.    We often read that oaks are springing up in destroyed forests where  oaks had never grown before. The writers are no doubt sincere, but  they are careless. The only pine forests where oaks are not intermixed  are either in land so sandy that oaks cannot be made to grow on them  at all, or so far north that they are beyond their northern limit. In  the Green Mountains and in the New England forests, in the pine  forests in Pennsylvania, in the Adirondacks, in Wisconsin and  Michigan--except in sand--I have found oaks mixed with the pines and  spruces. In northwestern Minnesota and in northern Dakota the oaks are  near their northern limit, but even there the burr oak drags on a bare  existence among the pines and spruces. In the Black Hills, in Dakota,  poor, forlorn, scrubby burr oaks are scattered through the hills among  the yellow pines. In Colorado we find them as shrubs among the pines  and Douglas spruces. In New Mexico we find them scattered among the  pinons. In Arizona they grow like hazel bushes among the yellow pines.  On the Sierra Nevada the oak region crosses the pine region, and  scattering oaks reach far up into the mountains. Yet oaks will not  flourish between the one hundredth meridian and the eastern base of  the Sierras, owing to the aridity of the climate. I recently found  oaks scattered among the redwoods on both sides of the Coast Range  Mountains.    Darwin has truly said, \"The oaks are driving the pines to the sands.\"  Wherever the oak is established--and we have seen that it is already  established whereever it can endure the soil and climate--there it  will remain and keep on advancing. The oak produces comparatively few  seeds. Where it produces a hundred, the ash and maple will yield a  thousand, the elm ten thousand, and many other trees a hundred  thousand. The acorn has no provision for protection and transportation  like many tree seeds. Many kinds are furnished with wings to float  them on the water and carry them in the air. Nearly every tree seed,  except the acorn, has a case to protect it while growing, either  opening and casting the seeds off to a distance when ripe or falling  with them to protect them till they begin to germinate. Even the  equally large seeds of other kinds are protected in some way. The  hickory nut has a hard shell, which shell itself is protected by a  strong covering until ripe. The black walnut has both a hard shell and  a fleshy covering. The acorn is the only seed I can think of which is  left by nature to take care of itself. It matures without protection,  falls heavily and helplessly to the ground, to be eaten and trodden on  by animals, yet the few which escape and those which are trodden under  are well able to compete in the race for life. While the elm and maple  seeds are drying up on the surface, the hickories and the walnuts  waiting to be cracked, the acorn is at work with its coat off. It  drives its tap root into the earth in spite of grass, and brush, and  litter. No matter if it is shaded by forest trees so that the sun  cannot penetrate, it will manage to make a short stem and a few leaves  the first season, enough to keep life in the root, which will drill in  deeper and deeper. When age or accident removes the tree which has  overshadowed it, then it will assert itself. Fires may run over the  land, destroying almost everything else, the oak will be killed to the  ground, but it will throw up a new shoot the next spring, the root  will keep enlarging, and when the opportunity arrives it will make a  vigorous growth, in proportion to the strength of the root, and throw  out strong side roots, and after that care no more for its tap root,  which has been its only support, than the frog cares for the tail of  the tadpole after it has got on its own legs.    There is no mystery about the succession of forest growths, nothing in  nature is more plain and simple. We cannot but admire her wisdom,  economy, and justness, compensating in another direction for any  disadvantage a species may have to labor under. Every kind of tree has  an interesting history in itself. Seeds with a hard shell, or with a  pulpy or resinous covering which retards their germination, are often  saved from becoming extinct by these means.    The red cedar (_Juniperus Virginiana_) reaches from Florida to and  beyond Cape Cod; it is among the hills of Tennessee, through the  Middle States and New England. It is scattered through the Western  States and Territories, at long distances apart, creeping up the  Platte River, in Nebraska. (I found only three in the Black Hills, in  Dakota, in an extended search for the different trees which grow  there. Found only one in a long ramble in the hills at Las Vegas, New  Mexico.)
