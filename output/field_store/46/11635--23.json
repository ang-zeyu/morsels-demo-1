When Abbot Michael died the Prior of Wymondham was  elected, but declined the abbacy, whereupon Thomas de la Mare was  elected. One of the proctors who started with him to Rome died on the  way of the Black Death. The new Abbot himself, after his appointment had  been confirmed, was taken seriously ill at Rome, but recovered with  great suddenness. He was a great favourite with Edward III., and it is  said that King John of France, who was taken prisoner at Poictiers in  1356, was for a time committed to his charge; he treated John with great  moderation and respect, and King John afterwards showed his appreciation  of his treatment by releasing some St. Albans men who were prisoners of  war in France, bidding them tell the Abbot that they owed their release  to him. The Abbot was strict in correcting faults, curbing excesses,  cutting away abuses, and putting things right; he was revered by all,  feared by many. He was appointed by the King as visitor to numerous  monasteries, and in 1351 was President of a general chapter of  Benedictines. Moreover his knowledge of painting was such that Edward  III. appointed him master of the painters assigned for the works to be  executed at the chapel of the Palace of Westminster, and the ornamental  painting and glazing of St. Stephen's Chapel was carried on for several  years under his supervision. After having been Abbot for some years he  wished to resign, but Edward III. would not hear of it. In the time of  Richard II. an attack was made by the followers of Wat Tyler on the  Abbey. They succeeded in extorting certain charters from the Abbot, but  after the collapse of the rebellion the King himself came to the Abbey  and stayed there for eight days, summoning all the commons of the county  to make oath to do suit and service to the Abbot and the convent in the  customary manner. He rebuilt the Great Gate of the Abbey (see Appendix).  He died on September 15th, 1396, having been Abbot for forty-seven  years, a longer period than any of his predecessors or successors. He  was buried before the high altar and a brass to his memory may now be  seen in the Wheathampstead chantry.    31. #John de la Moots# (1396-1401). He had held several offices in the  Abbey before his election as Abbot, and when Cellarer had been put in  the pillory in Luton Market, \"in hatred to the Abbot and utter contempt  of religion.\" The conspiracy to dethrone Richard II. was first formed at  the dinner table of this Abbot, when the Duke of Gloucester and the  Prior of Westminster were dining with him. In 1399 the body of John of  Gaunt rested in the Abbey on its way to London, his son, Henry Beaufort,  Bishop of Lincoln, being allowed to conduct a service in the Abbey; and  in the same year Richard II. and Henry, Duke of Lancaster, lodged at St.  Albans. On arrival in London Richard II. was dethroned, and the Bishop  of Carlisle, who took his side, was seized by order of the Duke of  Lancaster, soon to be known as Henry IV., and carried as a prisoner to  St. Albans; he was, however, afterwards pardoned by Henry. A dispute for  precedence between this Abbot and the Abbot of Westminster occurred.  John died in 1401.    32. #William Heyworth# (1401-1420). This Abbot was promoted to the see  of Lichfield in 1420, died in 1446 or 1447, and was buried in St.  Alban's Abbey.    [Illustration: JOHN OF WHEATHAMPSTEAD'S CHANTRY.]    33. #John of Wheathampstead# (1420-1440 and 1451-1464). The Abbot's  surname was Bostock, and it is supposed, as on his mother's grave in  Wheathampstead Church a shield bearing the Heyworth arms is found, that  John was a kinsman of his predecessor. To increase the revenue he  admitted many gentlemen and ladies of high rank to the confraternity;  this admission was a mere honour, conferring indeed the right to vote in  the chapter, but not imposing any duties or monastic restrictions on  those thus admitted. Among the names of those admitted in 1423 we find  those of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and Jaqueline his wife, whom he  subsequently divorced; in 1431 his new wife, Eleanor, was admitted. John  procured by royal grant lands in various quarters, and also, in order  that he might secure himself against any charges which might be made  against him, a pardon for diverse offences, of none of which was he in  all probability guilty--treason, murder, rape, rebellion, conspiracy,  etc. A strange light is thrown by this upon monkish morals of the day;  one would have thought no abbot would ever have been supposed possible  of committing such offences. These were disturbed times, for the King,  Henry VI., was imbecile and various nobles were intriguing against each  other for power. The star of Humphrey of Gloucester, the Abbot's friend,  was setting, and other troubles threatened the nation, so Abbot John  resigned in 1440.    34. #John Stokes# (1440-1451). This Abbot ruled for eleven years, and  then either died or resigned. During his rule Eleanor, Duchess of  Gloucester, was tried for witchcraft, was imprisoned in the Tower, and  did penance in the streets of London. Her husband died, or more probably  was murdered, in 1447, and was buried in the Abbey on the south side of  St. Alban's shrine.    33. In 1451 Abbot John of Wheathampstead, though over eighty years of  age, was re-elected. Soon after his election he gave his church a \"pair  of organs,\" surpassing all others in England in size, tone, and  workmanship.    In 1455 the Wars of the Roses began with the first battle of St. Albans  (May 23rd), fought to the east of the town. In this the White Rose party  were victorious; the King was taken prisoner and lodged for the night in  the Abbey. The victorious army plundered the town, but the Abbot by  sending out plenty of wine and food saved his monastery.    In 1459 King Henry was again at the Abbey and spent Easter there,  ordering his best robe to be given to the Prior when he left.    Another battle was fought, this time to the north of the town, on  February 17th, 1461. Henry was at this time in the hands of the Yorkists  and at St. Albans. The Queen, having defeated and slain the Duke of York  at Wakefield, marched southward at the head of an undisciplined horde of  18,000 men--Scotch, Irish, Welsh, and English--to rescue her husband.  The Earl of Warwick at first drove the Queen's troops out of St. Peter's  Street to Barnard's Heath with great slaughter, but, owing to treachery  on the part of one of the Yorkist leaders, the fortunes of the day  changed, and Margaret drove Warwick before her towards the town. He,  however, rallied his forces and retreated in good order to London,  though he had to leave Henry behind him. The royal party went to the  Abbey, where they were enthusiastically received by the monks, who  chanted thanksgivings for the victory; they were led to the high altar  and to the shrine of St. Alban. But the victorious troops, being little  better than barbarians, flushed with unexpected victory, committed  fearful excesses in the town, and even plundered the Abbey. Hitherto  Abbot John had been a strong partisan of the Lancastrians, but the  treatment he received turned him into a staunch Yorkist. Edward IV. when  he came to the throne granted the Abbot the right to hear and try all  causes, even treason, with full power of sentencing to death. The Abbots  continued to exercise these powers till 1533. In 1462 the Abbot  presented a petition to the King, setting forth the impoverished state  of the Abbey; this led to further powers being granted to the Abbot.  Wheathampstead had been ordained in 1382 and, according to canon law,  must have been twenty-five years of age, so he must have been over a  hundred and five when he died in 1463. He, as we have seen (Chap. I.),  made many changes for the worse in the fabric of the church; the  character of the work was partly due to the time in which he lived, for  the age of great architecture was over, and partly to lack of funds.    35. #William Alban# (1464-1476).    36. #William of Wallingford# (1476-1484). This Abbot's name will be  remembered because the high altar screen was his work, and is generally  called Wallingford's screen. It is said that his management of the  revenues of the Abbey was prudent, and that he was energetic in  defending his rights; but it would seem that he was not equally  energetic in repressing irregularities within its walls. During the  interregnum that followed his tenure of office things went on from bad  to worse, so that the Archbishop sent a monition to the Abbey reciting a  bull which had been sent to him as legate. This bull directed the  Archbishop to visit all the larger monasteries in which he had reason to  suspect that evil practices prevailed, and the Archbishop threatens to  visit St. Albans because he has heard of cases of simony, usury, lavish  expenditure, and immorality. He says unless within sixty days things are  reduced to order, not only in the monastery but also in the nunneries of  Pre and Sopwell and other cells, he will visit personally or by  commission to inquire into matters and set things in order. The Abbot  died in 1484, but his successor was not appointed until 1492.    37. #Thomas Ramryge# (1492- ). No details of events during the rule of  this Abbot exist, nor is the date of his death known.    38. #Thomas Wolsey# (1521-1529). This great cardinal was invested with  the temporalities on December 7th, 1521, and held the Abbey \"in  commendam.\" There is no record of his ever having resided in the Abbey,  but he probably put a stop to the printing which had been carried on in  the Abbey from 1480 onwards. He also made a gift of plate to the Abbey.  He held the office of Abbot until his disgrace in 1529.    39. #Robert Catton# (1530-1538). This Abbot was really appointed by  Henry VIII., but was nominally elected by the chapter. He had been Prior  of Norwich.

[Illustration: Fig. 66.]    200. When the root is not the bass note, figures are sometimes used to  show what chord is to be played or written. Thus, _e.g._, the figure 6  over a bass note means that the note given is the _third_ of a chord,  the root being found by going up a sixth from the bass note: _i.e._, the  chord is to be sounded in its first inversion. In the same way the  figures 6/4 indicate that the note given is the _fifth_ of the chord,  the root and fifth being found by going up a sixth and a fourth from the  note given; _i.e._, the chord is to be sounded in its second inversion.    The use of these and other similar figures and signs is called _figured  bass_ (or _thorough bass_) _notation_. An example of a _figured bass_ is  given in Fig. 67.    [Illustration: Fig. 67.]         _Thorough bass notation_ was formerly used extensively in       writing accompaniments to vocal works, the accompanist having       to interpret the notes and signs given, and then to make up an       interesting accompaniment as he went along. Much of Handel's       music was written in this way, but in modern editions of these       works the chords have been printed in full and the signs       omitted.    201. A _seventh chord_ consists of a fundamental tone with its third,  fifth, and seventh. The fifth is sometimes omitted. A _ninth chord_  consists of a fundamental with its third, fifth, seventh, and ninth.    202. A _cadence_ is the close of a musical phrase: in melody it refers  to the last two tones; in harmony to the last two chords.         The word _cadence_ is derived from _cadere_, a Latin word       meaning to _fall_, the reference being to the falling of the       voice (_i.e._, the dropping to the normal pitch) at the close       of a sentence.    203. The most frequent cadence in harmony is that involving the chord on  I preceded by the chord on V. Because of its directness the cadence V--I  is called the _authentic cadence_.    204. The most satisfactory form (to the ear) of the authentic cadence is  that in which the highest voice (the soprano) of the final chord is the  _root_ of that chord. When the final chord appears in this position the  cadence is called _perfect_[36] _authentic_, and when the third or  fifth of the chord appear in the soprano, the cadence is called  _imperfect authentic_. Fig. 68 shows the chord G--B--D cadencing to  C--E--G in three different ways. The first one (a) is called a _perfect  authentic cadence_, but the last two (c) and (d) are _imperfect  authentic_.    [Footnote 36: Many theorists (including Durand in his monumental  \"Treatise on Harmony\") consider the V--I cadence to be the only one  which may legitimately be called _perfect_, but the majority of writers  seem to take the view that either authentic or plagal cadence may be  either perfect or imperfect, depending upon the soprano tone, as noted  above.]    [Illustration: Fig. 68.]    205. A _plagal cadence_ is one in which the tonic chord is preceded by  the sub-dominant chord (IV--I). The _plagal cadence_ (sometimes called  the _church cadence_, or _amen cadence_), like the authentic, is  described as being _perfect_ when the soprano of the tonic chord is the  root of that chord, and _imperfect_ when the soprano of the final chord  is the third or fifth of that chord. Fig. 69 shows the chord F--A--C  cadencing to C--E--G in three ways. The first one (a) is called a  _perfect plagal cadence_, the last two are _imperfect plagal_.    [Illustration: Fig. 69.]    206. A _half-cadence_ occurs when the dominant chord is used as the  final chord of a phrase, and is immediately preceded by the tonic chord.  This form is used to give variety in the course of a composition, but is  not available at the end because it does not give a definite close in  the tonic key. Fig. 70 shows the use of the _half-cadence_ at the close  of such a phrase.    [Illustration: Fig. 70. BACH]    207. A _deceptive cadence_ is the progression of the dominant chord to  some other chord than the tonic, the word _deceptive_ implying that the  ear expects to hear V resolve to I and is deceived when it does not do  so. The most common form of _deceptive cadence_ is that in which V (or  V^7) resolves to VI. It is used to give variety, but as in the case of  the half-cadence, is not available at the end of a composition. Fig. 71  gives an example.    [Illustration: Fig. 71. WM. MATHER]    208. A _sequence_ is a succession of similar harmonic progressions,  these resulting from a typical or symmetrical movement of the bass part.  See Fig. 72.    [Illustration: Fig. 72.]    The word _sequence_ is also applied to a succession of similar melodic  progressions, as in Fig. 73.    [Illustration: Fig. 73.]    209. _Modulation_ is a change of key without any break in the continuity  of chords or melody tones. _Harmonic modulations_ are usually effected  through the medium of a chord, some or all of whose tones are common to  both keys. Examples of both _harmonic_ and _melodic modulations_ are  shown in Figs. 74 and 75.    [Illustration: Fig. 74.]    The chord most frequently used in modulating is the _dominant seventh_,  _i.e._, a seventh chord (see Sec. 201) on the dominant tone of the key.  In the key of C this chord is G--B--D--F; in the key of D it is  A--C[sharp]--E--G; in the key of A[flat] it is E[flat]--G--B[flat]--D[flat],  etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 75.]    210. A _suspension_ is the temporary substitution of a tone a degree  higher than the regular chord-tone, this temporary tone being later  replaced by the regular chord-tone. See Fig. 76 (_a_).    [Illustration: Fig. 76.]    211. A _retardation_ is the temporary substitution of a tone a degree  lower than the regular tone, this tone (as in the case of the  suspension) being later replaced by the regular chord tone. See Fig. 77  (_a_).    [Illustration: Fig. 77.]    The \"regular chord tone\" to which both suspension and retardation  resolve is called the _tone of resolution_.    212. The _anticipation_ is a chord-tone introduced just before the rest  of the chord to which it belongs is sounded. See Fig. 78 (_a_).    [Illustration: Fig. 78.]    213. A _pedal point_ (or _organ point_) is a tone sustained through a  succession of harmonic progressions, to the chords of some of which it  usually belongs. The term _pedal point_ originated in organ playing,  (where the foot on a pedal can sustain a tone while the hands are  playing a succession of harmonies), but as now used it may be applied to  any kind of music. The dominant and tonic are the tones most often used  in this way. See Fig. 79.    [Illustration: Fig. 79. SCHUMANN]    214. When the upper three voices of a four-voice composition are written  close together (the soprano and tenor never appearing more than an  octave apart), the term _close position_ is applied. But when the upper  voices are not written close together, the term _open position_ is  applied.    215. By _transposition_ is meant playing, singing, or writing a piece of  music in some other key than the original. Thus _e.g._, if a song  written in the key of G is too high in range for a soloist, the  accompanist sometimes _transposes_ it to a lower key (as F or E), thus  causing all tones to sound a second or a third lower than they did when  the same song was played in the original key.          CHAPTER XIX    MISCELLANEOUS TERMS      _A battuta_--with the beat; in strict rhythm. [Transcriber's Note:  Corrected error \"battua\" in original.]    _A quatre mains_--for four hands.    _Accompagnamento_--the accompaniment.    _All'unisono_--in unison.    _Alla breve_--2/2 measure.         The term _alla breve_ is also sometimes used as a tempo       indication, to show a rate of speed so great that a half-note       has a beat, _i.e._, only two beats in a measure--hence twice as       fast as before.    _Alla capella_--usually the same as a capella (see p. 76, Sec. 162) but  sometimes _used_ in the same sense as _alla breve_.    _Alla marcia_--in march style.    _Alla zingara_--in gypsy style.    _Alt_--see _in alt_.    _Alto_--the lowest female voice. Range approximately g-e''.         The word _alto_ is derived from the Latin word _altus_, meaning       _high_, the term being formerly applied to the highest male       voice, which originally sang (and still does so in many male       choirs) the alto part.    _Animato come sopra_--in animated style as above.    _Antiphony_ (_antiphonal_)--the responsive singing of two choirs,  usually one at either end of the church, or at either side of the  chancel.    _Arabesque_--an instrumental composition in light, somewhat fantastic  style.         The term _arabesque_ is derived from the word _Arabian_, and       was originally applied to a style of decoration.    _Arioso_--in the style of an air or song, _i.e._, a flowing, vocal  style.    _Attacca_--attack the next division without any pause.    _Attacca subito_--same as _attacca_.    _Attacca subito il seguente_--attack at once that which follows.

Its characteristic effect is the  continuous sounding of a low tone (sometimes several tones) while the  melody is being played on the higher reeds.    _Barcarole_ (or _barcarolle_)--a boat song. Also applied to a vocal or  instrumental composition in the style of the gondolier's boat song.    _Baritone_ (or _barytone_)--the male voice having a range between that  of the tenor and that of the bass.
