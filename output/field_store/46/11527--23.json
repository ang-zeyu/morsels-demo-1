And Athene told them the tale of the many woes  of Odysseus, recalling them to mind; for near her heart was  he that then abode in the dwelling of the nymph:    'Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for  ever, henceforth let not any sceptred king be kind and  gentle with all his heart, nor minded to do righteously,  but let him alway be a hard man and work unrighteousness,  for behold, there is none that remembereth divine Odysseus  of the people whose lord he was, and was gentle as a  father. Howbeit, as for him he lieth in an island suffering  strong pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who  holdeth him perforce; so he may not reach his own country,  for he hath no ships by him with oars, and no companions to  send him on his way over the broad back of the sea. And  now, again, they are set on slaying his beloved son on his  homeward way, for he is gone to fair Pylos and to goodly  Lacedaemon, to seek tidings of his father.'    And Zeus, gatherer of the clouds, answered and spake unto  her: 'My child, what word hath escaped the door of thy  lips? Nay, didst thou not thyself plan this device, that  Odysseus may assuredly take vengeance on those men at his  coming? As for Telemachus, do thou guide him by thine art,  as well as thou mayest, that so he may come to his own  country all unharmed, and the wooers may return in their  ship with their labour all in vain.'    Therewith he spake to Hermes, his dear son: 'Hermes,  forasmuch as even in all else thou art our herald, tell  unto the nymph of the braided tresses my unerring counsel,  even the return of the patient Odysseus, how he is to come  to his home, with no furtherance of gods or of mortal men.  Nay, he shall sail on a well-bound raft, in sore distress,  and on the twentieth day arrive at fertile Scheria, even at  the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the  gods. And they shall give him all worship heartily as to a  god, and send him on his way in a ship to his own dear  country, with gifts of bronze and gold, and raiment in  plenty, much store, such as never would Odysseus have won  for himself out of Troy, yea, though he had returned unhurt  with the share of the spoil that fell to him. On such wise  is he fated to see his friends, and come to his high-roofed  home and his own country.'    So spake he, nor heedless was the messenger, the slayer of  Argos. Straightway he bound beneath his feet his lovely  golden sandals, that wax not old, that bare him alike over  the wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the  breath of the wind. And he took the wand wherewith he lulls  the eyes of whomso he will, while others again he even  wakes from out of sleep. With this rod in his hand flew the  strong slayer of Argos. Above Pieria he passed and leapt  from the upper air into the deep. Then he sped along the  wave like the cormorant, that chaseth the fishes through  the perilous gulfs of the unharvested sea, and wetteth his  thick plumage in the brine. Such like did Hermes ride upon  the press of the waves. But when he had now reached that  far-off isle, he went forth from the sea of violet blue to  get him up into the land, till he came to a great cave,  wherein dwelt the nymph of the braided tresses: and he  found her within. And on the hearth there was a great fire  burning, and from afar through the isle was smelt the  fragrance of cleft cedar blazing, and of sandal wood. And  the nymph within was singing with a sweet voice as she  fared to and fro before the loom, and wove with a shuttle  of gold. And round about the cave there was a wood  blossoming, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress.  And therein roosted birds long of wing, owls and falcons  and chattering sea-crows, which have their business in the  waters. And lo, there about the hollow cave trailed a  gadding garden vine, all rich with clusters. And fountains  four set orderly were running with clear water, hard by one  another, turned each to his own course. And all around soft  meadows bloomed of violets and parsley, yea, even a  deathless god who came thither might wonder at the sight  and be glad at heart. There the messenger, the slayer of  Argos, stood and wondered. Now when he had gazed at all  with wonder, anon he went into the wide cave; nor did  Calypso, that fair goddess, fail to know him, when she saw  him face to face; for the gods use not to be strange one to  another, the immortals, not though one have his habitation  far away. But he found not Odysseus, the greathearted,  within the cave, who sat weeping on the shore even as  aforetime, straining his soul with tears and groans and  griefs, and as he wept he looked wistfully over the  unharvested deep. And Calypso, that fair goddess,  questioned Hermes, when she had made him sit on a bright  shining seat:    'Wherefore, I pray thee, Hermes, of the golden wand, hast  thou come hither, worshipful and welcome, whereas as of old  thou wert not wont to visit me? Tell me all thy thought; my  heart is set on fulfilling it, if fulfil it I may, and if  it hath been fulfilled in the counsel of fate. But now  follow me further, that I may set before thee the  entertainment of strangers.'    Therewith the goddess spread a table with ambrosia and set  it by him, and mixed the ruddy nectar. So the messenger,  the slayer of Argos, did eat and drink. Now after he had  supped and comforted his soul with food, at the last he  answered, and spake to her on this wise:    'Thou makest question of me on my coming, a goddess of a  god, and I will tell thee this my saying truly, at thy  command. 'Twas Zeus that bade me come hither, by no will of  mine; nay, who of his free will would speed over such a  wondrous space of brine, whereby is no city of mortals that  do sacrifice to the gods, and offer choice hecatombs? But  surely it is in no wise possible for another god to go  beyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the  aegis. He saith that thou hast with thee a man most  wretched beyond his fellows, beyond those men that round  the burg of Priam for nine years fought, and in the tenth  year sacked the city and departed homeward. Yet on the way  they sinned against Athene, and she raised upon them an  evil blast and long waves of the sea. Then all the rest of  his good company was lost, but it came to pass that the  wind bare and the wave brought him hither. And now Zeus  biddeth thee send him hence with what speed thou mayest,  for it is not ordained that he die away from his friends,  but rather it is his fate to look on them even yet, and to  come to his high-roofed home and his own country.'    So spake he, and Calypso, that fair goddess, shuddered and  uttered her voice, and spake unto him winged words: 'Hard  are ye gods and jealous exceeding, who ever grudge  goddesses openly to mate with men, if any make a mortal her  dear bed-fellow. Even so when rosy-fingered Dawn took Orion  for her lover, ye gods that live at ease were jealous  thereof, till chaste Artemis, of the golden throne, slew  him in Ortygia with the visitation of her gentle shafts. So  too when fair-tressed Demeter yielded to her love, and lay  with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow-field, Zeus was  not long without tidings thereof, and cast at him with his  white bolt and slew him. So again ye gods now grudge that a  mortal man should dwell with me. Him I saved as he went all  alone bestriding the keel of a bark, for that Zeus had  crushed {*} and cleft his swift ship with a white bolt in  the midst of the wine-dark deep. There all the rest of his  good company was lost, but it came to pass that the wind  bare and the wave brought him hither. And him have I loved  and cherished, and I said that I would make him to know not  death and age for ever. Yet forasmuch as it is no wise  possible for another god to go beyond, or make void the  purpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis, let him away over the  unharvested seas, if the summons and the bidding be of  Zeus. But I will give him no despatch, not I, for I have no  ships by me with oars, nor company to bear him on his way  over the broad back of the sea. Yet will I be forward to  put this in his mind, and will hide nought, that all  unharmed he may come to his own country.'    {* It seems very doubtful whether [Greek] can bear this  meaning. The reading [Greek], 'smote,' preserved by the  Schol. is highly probable.}    Then the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered her:  'Yea, speed him now upon his path and have regard unto the  wrath of Zeus, lest haply he be angered and bear hard on  thee hereafter.'    Therewith the great slayer of Argos departed, but the lady  nymph went on her way to the great-hearted Odysseus, when  she had heard the message of Zeus. And there she found him  sitting on the shore, and his eyes were never dry of tears,  and his sweet life was ebbing away as he mourned for his  return; for the nymph no more found favour in his sight.  Howsoever by night he would sleep by her, as needs he must,  in the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a willing lady. And  in the day-time he would sit on the rocks and on the beach,  straining his soul with tears, and groans, and griefs, and  through his tears he would look wistfully over the  unharvested deep. So standing near him that fair goddess  spake to him:    'Hapless man, sorrow no more I pray thee in this isle, nor  let thy good life waste away, for even now will I send thee  hence with all my heart. Nay, arise and cut long beams, and  fashion a wide raft with the axe, and lay deckings high  thereupon, that it may bear thee over the misty deep. And I  will place therein bread and water, and red wine to thy  heart's desire, to keep hunger far away. And I will put  raiment upon thee, and send a fair gale in thy wake, that  so thou mayest come all unharmed to thine own country, if  indeed it be the good pleasure of the gods who hold wide  heaven, who are stronger than I am both to will and to do.'    So she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#18)"],[1," their special contents, the general apparatus  of vocal expression is broadly the same everywhere. That all men alike  communicate by talking, other symbols and codes into which thoughts  can be translated, such as gestures, the various kinds of writing,  drum-taps, smoke signals, and so on, being in the main but secondary  and derivative, is a fact of which the very universality may easily  blind us to its profound significance. Meanwhile, the science of  phonetics--having lost that \"guid conceit of itself\" which once led  it to discuss at large whether the art of talking evolved at a single  geographical centre, or at many centres owing to similar capacities  of body and mind--contents itself now-a-days for the most part with  conducting an analytic survey of the modes of vocal expression as  correlated with the observed tendencies of the human speech-organs.  And what is true of phonetics in particular is hardly less true of  comparative philology as a whole. Its present procedure is in the main  analytic or formal. Thus its fundamental distinction between isolating,  agglutinative and inflectional languages is arrived at simply by  contrasting the different ways in which words are affected by being  put together into a sentence. No attempt is made to show that one type  of arrangement normally precedes another in time, or that it is in  any way more rudimentary--that is to say, less adapted to the needs  of human intercourse. It is not even pretended that a given language  is bound to exemplify one, and one alone, of these three types; though  the process known as analogy--that is, the regularizing of exceptions  by treating the unlike as if it were like--will always be apt to  establish one system at the expense of the rest.    If, then, the study of language is to recover its old pre-eminence  amongst anthropological studies, it looks as if a new direction must  be given to its inquiries. And there is much to be said for any change  that would bring about this result. Without constant help from the  philologist, anthropology is bound to languish. To thoroughly  understand the speech of the people under investigation is the  field-worker's master-key; so much so, that the critic's first  question in determining the value of an ethnographical work must always  be, Could the author talk freely with the natives in their own tongue?  But how is the study of particular languages to be pursued successfully,  if it lack the stimulus and inspiration which only the search for  general principles can impart to any branch of science? To relieve  the hack-work of compiling vocabularies and grammars, there must be  present a sense of wider issues involved, and such issues as may  directly interest a student devoted to language for its own sake. The  formal method of investigating language, in the meantime, can hardly  supply the needed spur. Analysis is all very well so long as its  ultimate purpose is to subserve genesis--that is to say, evolutionary  history. If, however, it tries to set up on its own account, it is  in danger of degenerating into sheer futility. Out of time and history  is, in the long run, out of meaning and use. The philologist, then,  if he is to help anthropology, must himself be an anthropologist, with  a full appreciation of the importance of the historical method. He  must be able to set each language or group of languages that he studies  in its historical setting. He must seek to show how it has evolved  in relation to the needs of a given time. In short, he must correlate  words with thoughts; must treat language as a function of the social  life.           *       *       *       *       *    Here, however, it is not possible to attempt any but the most general  characterization of primitive language as it throws light on the  workings of the primitive intelligence. For one reason, the subject  is highly technical; for another reason, our knowledge about most types  of savage speech is backward in the extreme; whilst, for a third and  most far-reaching reason of all, many peoples, as we have seen, are  not speaking the language truly native to their powers and habits of  mind, but are expressing themselves in terms imported from another  stock, whose spiritual evolution has been largely different. Thus it  is at most possible to contrast very broadly and generally the more  rudimentary with the more advanced methods that mankind employs for  the purpose of putting its experience into words. Happily the careful  attention devoted by American philologists to the aboriginal languages  of their continent has resulted in the discovery of certain principles  which the rest of our evidence, so far as it goes, would seem to stamp  as of world-wide application. The reader is advised to study the most  stimulating, if perhaps somewhat speculative, pages on language in  the second volume of E.J. Payne's _History of the New World called  America_; or, if he can wrestle with the French tongue, to compare  the conclusions here reached with those to which Professor Levy-Bruhl  is led, largely by the consideration of this same American group of  languages, in his recent work, _Les Fonctions Mentales dans les  Societes Inferieures_ (\"Mental Functions in the Lower Societies\").    If the average man who had not looked into the matter at all were asked  to say what sort of language he imagined a savage to have, he would  be pretty sure to reply that in the first place the vocabulary would  be very small, and in the second place that it would consist of very  short, comprehensive terms--roots, in fact--such as \"man,\" \"bear,\"  \"eat,\" \"kill,\" and so on. Nothing of the sort is actually the case.  Take the inhabitants of that cheerless spot, Tierra del Fuego, whose  culture is as rude as that of any people on earth. A scholar who tried  to put together a dictionary of their language found that he had got  to reckon with more than thirty thousand words, even after suppressing  a large number of forms of lesser importance. And no wonder that the  tally mounted up. For the Fuegians had more than twenty words, some  containing four syllables, to express what for us would be either \"he\"  or \"she\"; then they had two names for the sun, two for the moon, and  two more for the full moon, each of the last-named containing four  syllables and having no element in common. Sounds, in fact, are with  them as copious as ideas are rare. Impressions, on the other hand,  are, of course, infinite in number. By means of more or less significant  sounds, then, Fuegian society compounds impressions, and that somewhat  imperfectly, rather than exchanges ideas, which alone are the currency  of true thought.    For instance, I-cut-bear's-leg-at-the-joint-with-a-flint-now  corresponds fairly well with the total impression produced by the  particular act; though, even so, I have doubtless selectively reduced  the notion to something I can comfortably take in, by leaving out a  lot of unnecessary detail--for instance, that I was hungry, in a hurry,  doing it for the benefit of others as well as myself, and so on. Well,  American languages of the ruder sort, by running a great number of  sounds or syllables together, manage to utter a portmanteau  word--\"holophrase\" is the technical name for it--into which is packed  away enough suggestions to reproduce the situation in all its detail,  the cutting, the fact that I did it, the object, the instrument, the  time of the cutting, and who knows what besides. Amusing examples of  such portmanteau words meet one in all the text-books. To go back to  the Fuegians, their expression _mamihlapinatapai_ is said to mean \"to  look at each other hoping that either will offer to do something which  both parties desire but are unwilling to do.\" Now, since exactly the  same situation never recurs, but is partly the same and partly  different, it is clear that, if the holophrase really tried to hit  off in each case the whole outstanding impression that a given  situation provoked, then the same combination of sounds would never  recur either; one could never open one's mouth without coining a new  word. Ridiculous as this notion sounds, it may serve to mark a downward  limit from which the rudest types of human speech are not so very far  removed. Their well-known tendency to alter their whole character in  twenty years or less is due largely to the fluid nature of primitive  utterance; it being found hard to detach portions, capable of repeated  use in an unchanged form, from the composite vocables wherein they  register their highly concrete experiences.    Thus in the old Huron-Iroquois language _eschoirhon_ means  \"I-have-been-to-the-water,\" _setsanha_ \"Go-to-the-water,\"  _ondequoha_ \"There-is-water-in-the-bucket,\" _daustantewacharet_  \"There-is-water-in-the-pot.\" In this case there is said to have been  a common word for \"water,\" _awen_, which, moreover, is somehow  suggested to an aboriginal ear as an element contained in each of these  longer forms. In many other cases the difficulty of isolating the  common meaning, and fixing it by a common term, has proved too much  altogether for a primitive language. You can express twenty different  kinds of cutting; but you simply cannot say \"cut\" at all. No wonder  that a large vocabulary is found necessary, when, as in Zulu, \"my  father,\" \"thy father,\" \"his-or-her-father,\" are separate  polysyllables without any element in common.    The evolution of language, then, on this view, may be regarded as a  movement out of, and away from, the holophrastic in the direction of  the analytic. When every piece in your play-box of verbal bricks can  be dealt with separately, because it is not joined on in all sorts  of ways to the other pieces, then only can you compose new constructions  to your liking. Order and emphasis, as is shown by English, and still  more conspicuously by Chinese, suffice for sentence-building. Ideally,  words should be individual and atomic. "]]]
