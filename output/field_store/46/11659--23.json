A contributor to the _Gentleman's Magazine_, 7th February 1795, gives  the following account of a custom which took place annually on the  24th of December, at the house of a gentleman residing at Aston, near  Birmingham. \"As soon as supper is over, a table is set in the hall. On  it is placed a brown loaf, with twenty silver threepences stuck on  the top of it, a tankard of ale, with pipes and tobacco; and the two  oldest servants have chairs behind it, to sit as judges, if they  please. The steward brings the servants, both men and women, by one at  a time, covered with a winnow sheet, and lays their right hand on the  loaf, exposing no other part of the body. The oldest of the two judges  guesses at the person, by naming a name, then the younger judge, and,  lastly, the oldest again. If they hit upon the right person, the  steward leads the person back again; but, if they do not, he takes off  the winnow sheet, and the person receives a threepence, makes a low  obeisance to the judges, but speaks not a word. When the second  servant was brought, the younger judge guessed first and third; and  this they did alternately, till all the money was given away. Whatever  servant had not slept in the house the preceding night forfeited his  right to the money. No account is given of the origin of this strange  custom, but it has been practised ever since the family lived there.  When the money is gone, the servants have full liberty to drink,  dance, sing, and go to bed when they please.\"    In Cornwall, in many villages, Christmas merriment begins on the  vigil, when the \"mock\" or Yule log is lighted by a portion saved from  last year's fire. The family gather round the blaze, and amuse  themselves with various games; and even the younger children are  allowed, as a special favour, to sit up till a late hour to see the  fun, and afterwards \"to drink to the mock.\" In the course of the  evening the merriment is increased by the entry of the \"goosey  dancers\" (guised dancers), the boys and girls of the village, who have  rifled their parents' wardrobes of old coats and gowns and, thus  disguised, dance and sing, and beg money to make merry with. They are  allowed, and are not slow to take, a large amount of license in  consideration of the season. It is considered to be out of character  with the time, and a mark of an ill-natured churlish disposition, to  take offence at anything they do or say. This mumming is kept up  during the week.    A very graphic description of Christmas eve in a Derbyshire cottage is  given in _Notes and Queries_.[38] \"For several weeks before Christmas  the cottager's household is much busier than usual in making  preparations for the great holiday. The fatted pig has been killed, as  a matter of course, and Christmas pies, mince pies, and many other  good things made from it in readiness for the feast. The house has  been thoroughly cleaned, and all made 'spick and span.' The lads of  the house, with those of their neighbours, have been learning their  parts, and getting ready their dresses for the 'Christmas guising,'  and the household daily talk is full flavoured of Christmas.    [Footnote 38: Fifth series, viii. p. 481.]    \"The lasses have made their own special preparations, and for two or  three days before Christmas Eve have been getting ready the accustomed  house decorations--short garlands of holly and other evergreens for  the tops of cupboards, pictures, and other furniture--and making up  the most important decoration of all, 'the kissing-bunch.'    \"This 'kissing-bunch' is always an elaborate affair. The size depends  upon the couple of hoops--one thrust through the other--which form its  skeleton. Each of the ribs is garlanded with holly, ivy, and sprigs of  other greens, with bits of coloured ribbons and paper roses, rosy  cheeked apples, specially reserved for this occasion, and oranges.  Three small dolls are also prepared, often with much taste, and these  represent our Saviour, the mother of Jesus, and Joseph. These dolls  generally hang within the kissing-bunch by strings from the top, and  are surrounded by apples, oranges tied to strings, and various  brightly coloured ornaments. Occasionally, however, the dolls are  arranged in the kissing-bunch to represent a manger scene.    \"When the preparations are completed, the house is decorated during  the day of Christmas eve. Every leaded window-pane holds its sprig of  holly, ivy, or box; the ornaments on and over the mantel-shelf receive  like attention, and every ledge and corner is loaded with green stuff.  Mistletoe is not very plentiful in Derbyshire; but, generally, a bit  is obtainable, and this is carefully tied to the bottom of the  kissing-bunch, which is then hung in the middle of the house-place,  the centre of attraction during Christmas-tide.    \"While all this is going on, the housewife is very busy. 'Black-ball'  has to be made; the 'elderberry wine' to be got out; 'sugar, spice,  and all that's nice' and needful placed handy. The shop has to be  visited, and the usual yearly gift of one, two, or three Christmas  candles received. With these last, as every one knows, the house is  lit up at dusk on Christmas Eve.    \"Without the 'black-ball' just mentioned, the Christmas rejoicings in  a cottage would not be complete. 'Black-ball' is a delicacy compounded  of black treacle and sugar boiled together in a pan, to which, when  boiling, is added a little flour, grated ginger, and spices. When it  is boiled enough, it is poured into a large shallow dish, and, when  partially cooled, is cut into squares and lengths, then rolled or  moulded into various shapes. When quite cool, it is very hard, and  very toothsome to young Derbyshire.    \"After an early tea-meal, the fire is made up with a huge Yule-log;  all the candles, oil and fat lamps lit, and everything is bright and  merry-looking. The head of the family sits in the chimney corner with  pipe and glass of ale, or mulled elder wine. The best table is set  out, and fairly loaded with Christmas and mince pies, oranges, apples,  nuts, 'black-baw,' wine, cakes, and green cheese, and the whole  family, with the guests, if any, set about enjoying themselves.  Romping games are the order of the eve, broken only when the  'guisers'--of whom there are always several sets--or waits arrive. The  'guisers' are admitted indoors, and go through the several acts of  their play. At the conclusion 'Betsy Belzebub' collects coppers from  the company, and glasses of ale and wine are given to the players. The  Waits, or 'Christmas Singers' as they are mostly called, sing their  carols and hymns outside the house, and during the performance cakes  and ale, wine, and other cheer are carried out to them. So the Eve  passes on.    \"At nine or ten o'clock is brewed a large bowl of 'poor man's  punch'--ale posset! This is the event of the night. Ale posset, or  milk and ale posset as some call it, is made in this wise. Set a quart  of milk on the fire. While it boils, crumble a twopenny loaf into a  deep bowl, upon which pour the boiling milk. Next, set two quarts of  good ale to boil, into which grate ginger and nutmeg, adding a  quantity of sugar. When the ale nearly boils, add it to the milk and  bread in the bowl, stirring it while it is being poured in.    \"The bowl of ale posset is then placed in the centre of the table. All  the single folks gather round, each provided with a spoon. Then  follows an interesting ceremony. A wedding ring, a bone button, and a  fourpenny piece are thrown into the bowl, and all begin to eat, each  dipping to the bottom of the bowl. He or she who brings up the ring  will be the first married; whoever brings up the button will be an old  maid or an old bachelor; and he or she who brings out the coin will  become the richest. As may be imagined, this creates great fun. When  seven shilling gold pieces were in circulation, this was the coin  always thrown into the posset.    \"The games are resumed when the posset is eaten, or possibly all  gather round the fire, and sing or tell stories, whiling away the  hours till the stroke of twelve, when all go outside the house to  listen, whilst the singers, who have gathered at some point in the  village, sing 'Christians, awake!' or 'Hark! the Herald Angels Sing';  and so comes to an end the cottager's one hearth-stone holiday of the  whole year.\"          CHAPTER XI         Christmas Eve in North Notts--Wassailing the Fruit       Trees--Wassail Songs--Wassailing in Sussex--Other       Customs--King at Downside College--A Christ-tide       Carol--Midnight Mass--The Manger--St. Francis of Assisi.      As these old customs are fast dying out, and should be chronicled, I  must be pardoned if I give another and very similar illustration of  how Christmas eve was spent in North Notts fifty years ago.[39]    [Footnote 39: _Notes and Queries_, seventh series, ii. 501.]    \"None keep Christmas nowadays as was the fashion fifty to a hundred  years ago in this part of the country. Here and there are to be met  the customs, or bits of the customs, which were then observed: but, as  a rule, the old ways have given place to new ones. Here in North  Notts, every house is more or less decked in the few days before  Christmas Day with holly, ivy, and evergreens, nor is mistletoe  forgotten, which would scarcely be likely by any one living within a  dozen miles of Sherwood Forest, where mistletoe grows in rare  profusion on thorn bushes, the oak, and other trees, and under certain  conditions may be had for the asking.    \"Fifty years ago, at any rate, in all the villages and towns of North  Notts, the preparations among farmers, tradesmen, and poor folks for  keeping Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were always on a bountiful  scale. Fat pigs were killed a week or so previously, portions of which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#18)"],[1,"to him that  coveteth an evil covetousness that he may set his nest on high. Woe to  him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by  iniquity. Behold, is it not of the Lord of Hosts that the people shall  labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very  vanity?\"    The Americans, who have been sending out ships with sham bolt-heads on  their timbers, and only half their bolts, may meditate on that \"buildeth  a town with blood.\"]      113. Therefore, I believe most firmly, that as the laws of national  prosperity get familiar to us, we shall more and more cast our toil into  social and communicative systems; and that one of the first means of our  doing so, will be the re-establishing guilds of every important trade in  a vital, not formal, condition;--that there will be a great council or  government house for the members of every trade, built in whatever town  of the kingdom occupies itself principally in such trade, with minor  council-halls in other cities; and to each council-hall, officers  attached, whose first business may be to examine into the circumstances  of every operative, in that trade, who chooses to report himself to them  when out of work, and to set him to work, if he is indeed able and  willing, at a fixed rate of wages, determined at regular periods in the  council-meetings; and whose next duty may be to bring reports before the  council of all improvements made in the business, and means of its  extension: not allowing private patents of any kind, but making all  improvements available to every member of the guild, only allotting,  after successful trial of them, a certain reward to the inventors.      114. For these, and many other such purposes, such halls will be again,  I trust, fully established, and then, in the paintings and decorations  of them, especial effort ought to be made to express the worthiness and  honourableness of the trade for whose members they are founded. For I  believe one of the worst symptoms of modern society to be, its notion of  great inferiority, and ungentlemanliness, as necessarily belonging to  the character of a tradesman. I believe tradesmen may be, ought to  be--often are, more gentlemen than idle and useless people: and I  believe that art may do noble work by recording in the hall of each  trade, the services which men belonging to that trade have done for  their country, both preserving the portraits, and recording the  important incidents in the lives, of those who have made great advances  in commerce and civilization. I cannot follow out this subject--it  branches too far, and in too many directions; besides, I have no doubt  you will at once see and accept the truth of the main principle, and be  able to think it out for yourselves. I would fain also have said  something of what might be done, in the same manner, for almshouses and  hospitals, and for what, as I shall try to explain in notes to this  lecture, we may hope to see, some day, established with a different  meaning in their name than that they now bear--work-houses; but I have  detained you too long already, and cannot permit myself to trespass  further on your patience except only to recapitulate, in closing, the  simple principles respecting wealth which we have gathered during the  course of our inquiry; principles which are nothing more than the  literal and practical acceptance of the saying which is in all good  men's mouths--namely, that they are stewards or ministers of whatever  talents are entrusted to them.      115. Only, is it not a strange thing, that while we more or less accept  the meaning of that saying, so long as it is considered metaphorical, we  never accept its meaning in its own terms? You know the lesson is given  us under the form of a story about money. Money was given to the  servants to make use of: the unprofitable servant dug in the earth, and  hid his lord's money. Well, we, in our political and spiritual  application of this, say, that of course money doesn't mean money: it  means wit, it means intellect, it means influence in high quarters, it  means everything in the world except itself. And do not you see what a  pretty and pleasant come-off there is for most of us, in this spiritual  application? Of course, if we had wit, we would use it for the good of  our fellow-creatures. But we haven't wit. Of course, if we had influence  with the bishops, we would use it for the good of the Church; but we  haven't any influence with the bishops. Of course, if we had political  power, we would use it for the good of the nation; but we have no  political power; we have no talents entrusted to us of any sort or kind.  It is true we have a little money, but the parable can't possibly mean  anything so vulgar as money; our money's our own.      116. I believe, if you think seriously of this matter, you will feel  that the first and most literal application is just as necessary a one  as any other--that the story does very specially mean what it  says--plain money; and that the reason we don't at once believe it does  so, is a sort of tacit idea that while thought, wit, and intellect, and  all power of birth and position, are indeed _given_ to us, and,  therefore, to be laid out for the Giver--our wealth has not been given  to us; but we have worked for it, and have a right to spend it as we  choose. I think you will find that is the real substance of our  understanding in this matter. Beauty, we say, is given by God--it is a  talent; strength is given by God--it is a talent; position is given by  God--it is a talent; but money is proper wages for our day's work--it is  not a talent, it is a due. We may justly spend it on ourselves, if we  have worked for it.      117. And there would be some shadow of excuse for this, were it not that  the very power of making the money is itself only one of the  applications of that intellect or strength which we confess to be  talents. Why is one man richer than another? Because he is more  industrious, more persevering, and more sagacious. Well, who made him  more persevering or more sagacious than others? That power of endurance,  that quickness of apprehension, that calmness of judgment, which enable  him to seize the opportunities that others lose, and persist in the  lines of conduct in which others fail--are these not talents?--are they  not, in the present state of the world, among the most distinguished and  influential of mental gifts? And is it not wonderful, that while we  should be utterly ashamed to use a superiority of body, in order to  thrust our weaker companions aside from some place of advantage, we  unhesitatingly use our superiorities of mind to thrust them back from  whatever good that strength of mind can attain? You would be indignant  if you saw a strong man walk into a theatre or a lecture-room, and,  calmly choosing the best place, take his feeble neighbour by the  shoulder, and turn him out of it into the back seats, or the street. You  would be equally indignant if you saw a stout fellow thrust himself up  to a table where some hungry children were being fed, and reach his arm  over their heads and take their bread from them. But you are not the  least indignant if, when a man has stoutness of thought and swiftness of  capacity, and, instead of being long-armed only, has the much greater  gift of being long-headed--you think it perfectly just that he should  use his intellect to take the bread out of the mouths of all the other  men in the town who are of the same trade with him; or use his breadth  and sweep of sight to gather some branch of the commerce of the country  into one great cobweb, of which he is himself to be the central spider,  making every thread vibrate with the points of his claws, and commanding  every avenue with the facets of his eyes. You see no injustice in this.      118. But there is injustice; and, let us trust, one of which honourable  men will at no very distant period disdain to be guilty. In some degree,  however, it is indeed not unjust; in some degree, it is necessary and  intended. It is assuredly just that idleness should be surpassed by  energy; that the widest influence should be possessed by those who are  best able to wield it; and that a wise man, at the end of his career,  should be better off than a fool. But for that reason, is the fool to be  wretched, utterly crushed down, and left in all the suffering which his  conduct and capacity naturally inflict?--Not so. What do you suppose  fools were made for? That you might tread upon them, and starve them,  and get the better of them in every possible way? By no means. They were  made that wise people might take care of them. That is the true and  plain fact concerning the relations of every strong and wise man to the  world about him. He has his strength given him, not that he may crush  the weak, but that he may support and guide them. In his own household  he is to be the guide and the support of his children; out of his  household he is still to be the father--that is, the guide and  support--of the weak and the poor; not merely of the meritoriously weak  and the innocently poor, but of the guiltily and punishably poor; of the  men who ought to have known better--of the poor who ought to be ashamed  of themselves. It is nothing to give pension and cottage to the widow  who has lost her son; it is nothing to give food and medicine to the  workman who has broken his arm, or the decrepit woman wasting in  sickness. But it is something to use your time and strength to war with  the waywardness and thoughtlessness of mankind; to keep the erring  workman in your service till you have made him an unerring one; and to  direct your fellow-merchant to the opportunity which his dulness would  have lost. This is much; but it is yet more, when you have fully  achieved the superiority which is due to you, and acquired the wealth  which is the fitting reward of your sagacity, if "]]]
