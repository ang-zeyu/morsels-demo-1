Blyth includes this bat in his  Burmese Catalogue, but does not say much about it.      GENUS COELOPS.    Possesses the general characteristics of _Rhinolophus_, but the tail  and calcanea wanting entirely; the intercrural membrane acutely  emarginate to the depth of a line even with the knees; ears large,  broad and rounded; the summit of the facial membranes rising abruptly,  obtusely bifid, bent forward; fur long, delicately fine.--_Jerdon_.    Dental formula: Inc., 1--1/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars,  2--2/2--2; molars, 3--3/3--3.      NO. 68. COELOPS FRITHII.  _Frith's Tailless Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 29_).    HABITAT.--The Sunderbunds, Bengal.    DESCRIPTION.--Colour dusky or blackish; the fur tipped with ashy  brown above, paler and somewhat ashy beneath; membranes fuscous.    SIZE.--Length, 1-7/8 inch; membrane beyond 3/4 inch; forearm, 1-3/4.    This bat is rare. The above description, given by Jerdon, is based  on one specimen sent to Mr. Blyth by Mr. Frith, who obtained it in  the Sunderbunds. It also inhabits Java. Dr. Dobson examined a  specimen from thence in the Leyden Museum. He says: \"Calcanea and  tail very short,\" whereas the above description says entirely  wanting. \"The ears are funnel-shaped, and thickly covered with fine  hair. Metacarpal bone of thumb very long; the wing membrane enclosing  the thumb up to the base of the claw; wing to the tarsus close to  the ankles; feet very slender; toes with strong claws.\"      _GENUS RHINOPOMA_.    Ears moderate, but joined above, as in the Megaderms; the nostrils  at the end of the muzzle, with a little lamina above, forming a kind  of snout; tail slender and joined at the base with the intercrural  membrane, but extending far beyond it.    Dental formula: Inc., 2/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars, 1--1/2--2;  molars 3--3/3--3.      NO. 69. RHINOPOMA HARDWICKII.  _Hardwick's Long-tailed Leaf Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 30_).    HABITAT.--All over India, Burmah and Malayana.    [Figure: Skull of _Rhinopoma_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle long, thick, truncated, and surrounded by a  small leaf; tragus oblong, bi-acuminate; forehead concave with a  channel down the centre; fur soft and very fine, dull brown  throughout; face, rump, and part of abdominal region naked.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2-6/10 inches; tail, 2-1/2; expanse, 13.    Frequents old ruins, caves, and clefts in rocks.      SUB-FAMILY NOCTILIONIDAE.    Bats without facial membranes; with short obtuse and bull-doggish  heads; large lips.      _GENUS TAPHOZOUS_.    Have a small rounded indenture on the forehead; no raised lamina on  the nostrils; the head pyramidal; eyes rather large; ears moderate  in size and not joined at the base, but widely apart; the tip of the  tail free above the membrane, which is much longer.    The males have a transverse cavity under the throat; wings long and  narrow, collapsing with a double flexure outwards; fur soft and  velvety. (Dobson includes this genus in his Family _Emballonuridae_.)    Dental formula: Inc., 1--1/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars,  2--2/2--2; molars, 3--3/3--3; premaxillaries cartilaginous,  supporting only one pair of weak incisors with a gap between them.      NO. 70. TAPHOZOUS LONGIMANUS.  _The Long-armed Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 31_).    HABITAT.--India generally.    DESCRIPTION.--\"Ears oval, with many distinct folds, naked except at  the base; tragus securiform; fur thick, close, fuscous-black; or  dark fuscous-brown above; beneath paler, except on the throat, the  hairs being conspicuously tipped with grey, the upper hairs being  all white at their base; face nude, and the membrane dark  brownish-black\" (_Jerdon_). The gular sac, though represented in the  male, is almost absent in the female, being but a rudimentary fold  of skin; in this it differs from another common Indian species, _T.  saccolaimus_, in which the gular sac is well developed in both sexes,  though larger in the male.    SIZE.--Length, 5 inches; expanse, 15 to 16; tail, 1; fore-arm, 2-5/8;  tibia, 1 inch.    This bat frequents old buildings, dark cellars, old ruins, &c.; the  young are fulvescent, and become darker with age. Blyth states that  it has a surprising faculty for creeping about on the vertical board  of a cage, hitching its claws into the minute pores of the wood.      NO. 71. TAPHOZOUS MELANOPOGON.  _The Black-bearded Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 32_).    HABITAT.--Common about Calcutta, East Coast of India, Burmah, and  Cochin China.    DESCRIPTION.--\"No gular sac, the openings of small pores appearing  along a line corresponding to the position of the mouth of the gular  sac in other species; in some male specimens the hair behind these  pores is very long, forming a dense black beard\" (_Dobson_). Ears  moderate, oval, with the outer margin extending under the eyes,  dilated into a large rounded lobe; the tragus leaf-shaped; the head,  muzzle, and chin covered with short hairs.    SIZE.--Length of head and body about 3-1/2; tail, 2/3; wing expanse,  14 inches.    Horsfield says it occurs in caves in Java inhabited by the esculent  swallows (_Collocalia nidifica_), the gelatinous nests of which are  used for soup by the Chinese. Dobson remarks that the black beard  is not always developed in the males; he conceives it to be owing  to certain conditions, probably connected with the amorous seasons.  In five males in the Indian Museum the beard is well developed; he  found that only two per cent. of the Cochin China specimens in the  Paris Museum possessed it.      NO. 72. TAPHOZOUS SACCOLAIMUS.  _The White-bellied Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 33_).    HABITAT.--Peninsula of India, Burmah, and Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--\"Muzzle angular, naked, very acute; nostrils small,  close; ears distant, shorter than the head, large inner margin  recurved, outer margin dilated, reaching to the commissure of the  mouth; tragus wide, securiform (i.e. axe-shaped); fur short, smooth,  blackish on the head, chestnut brown on the back; beneath,  dirty-white or black brown above with white pencillings; pure white  below\" (_Jerdon_). Dobson says of the fur: \"above, white at the base,  the terminal three-fourths of the hairs black, with a few irregular  small white patches on the back; beneath dark brown.\" The gular sac  is to be found in both sexes, but somewhat larger in the males.    SIZE.--About 5 inches; wing expanse, 17.      NO. 73. TAPHOZOUS THEOBALDI.    HABITAT.--Tenasserim.    DESCRIPTION.--The gular sac is absent in both sexes; ears larger than  in any others of the sub-genus; the muzzle, from the corners of the  eyes downwards, naked.    SIZE.--Head and body about 3-1/10 inches; tail, 1-1/4.      NO. 74. TAPHOZOUS KACHHENSIS.    HABITAT.--Kachh, N. W. India.    DESCRIPTION (_apud_ Dobson).--\"Gular sac absent in both male and  female; its usual position indicated in the male by a semi-circular  fold of skin and nakedness of the integument in this situation; in  other respects similar to _T. nudiventris_. The deposits of fat about  the tail very large.\"    SIZE.--Head and body about 3 inches; tail, 1-1/4.    _T. nudiventris_, above alluded to, is an inhabitant of Asia Minor,  Egypt, and Nubia; similar to the above, only that it has a small gular  sac in the male, of which a trace only exists in the female. Its most  striking peculiarity is the deposit of fat at the root of the tail,  which may possibly be for purposes of absorption during the dormant  winter season.      _GENUS NYCTINOMUS_.    \"Ears broad, short, approximate or connate with the outer margin,  terminating in an erect lobe beyond the conch; tragus small,  concealed\" (often very small and quadrate, but never reduced to a  mere point, as in _Molossus_--Dobson); \"wings narrow, folded as in  _Taphozous_; intercrural membrane short, truncate; tall free at the  tip; feet short, with strong toes; muzzle thick; lips tumid, lax;  upper lip with coarse wrinkles.\"--_Jerdon_.    Dental formula: Inc., 2/6 or 2/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premol.,  2--2/2--2; mol., 3--3/3--3.      NO. 75. NYCTINOMUS PLICATUS.  _The Wrinkle-lipped Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 34_).    HABITAT.--India generally.    DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle broad and thick; upper lip overhanging the  lower, marked by vertical wrinkles; ears large and quadrilateral;  outer margin ending in a decided anti-tragus; tail thick; the lower  part of the leg is free from the wing membrane, which however, is  connected with the ankle by a strong fibrous band; fur dense, smoky  or snuff brown above (or bluish black--_Dobson_); paler beneath.    SIZE.--Head and body about 2-1/10 inches; tail, 1-1/10. Jerdon gives  length, 4-1/4 to 4-1/10; expanse, 13-1/2; tail, 1-3/4.    This bat is common about Calcutta, frequenting ruins, dark places  and hollow trees. It is allied to _N. tenuis_ (_Horsfield_), and it  is mentioned as inhabiting hollow trees in such numbers as to attract  attention by the hissing noise from within, every available spot in  the interior being occupied. A synonym of the genus is _Dysopes_.      NO. 76. NYCTINOMUS TRAGATUS.    HABITAT.--India generally.    DESCRIPTION.--This differs from the last in having the wing membrane  from the ankles, and in the free portion of the tail being shorter;  ears united at the base; tragus broad and rounded above, partially  concealed by the large anti-tragus.    SIZE.--About the same as the last.      SUB-FAMILY VESPERTILIONIDAE.    These bats have simple nostrils, as in the frugivorous ones, with  no complications of foliated cutaneous appendages; the muzzle is  conical, moderately long, and clad with fur; the ears wide apart;  the inner margins springing from the sides, not the top of the head;  the tragi are large; eyes usually very small, and the tail, which  is long, is wholly included in the membrane.    Dentition (usually): Inc., 2--2/6; can., 1--1/1--1, premol.,  3--3/3--3; mol., 3--3/3--3. The upper incisors are small, and placed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],[0,"The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#18)"],[1," then silk socks.    8. Don't overeat or overdrink.    9. A light pair of sneakers or canvas tennis shoes are serviceable for  camp wear in the afternoons and are restful to the feet.    10. Each morning sprinkle a little talcum powder or footease in the  shoes.    11. Keep the bowels functioning properly. Should you become constipated,  report to the doctor for medicine before you begin to feel badly.    12. Clean your mess kit immediately after each meal.    13. Respect the property of others.      EQUIPMENT    During the hike your equipment for living will be limited to: (1) your  pack (things that you carry on your back), (2) a few authorized articles  which are placed in a squad laundry bag (called a surplus kit), and (3)  a blanket roll.    Contents of the Pack    1 bacon can.  1 condiment can.  1 blanket.  1 poncho.  1 shelter half (one-half of a small tent)  5 small tent pins.  1 tooth brush.  1 comb and any other toilet articles desired.  1 cake of soap.  1 or 2 towels.  1 extra suit of underwear.  1 pair socks.  1 pair shoe strings.      Contents of Surplus Kit    1 pair of breeches.  1 suit of underwear.  1 shirt, olive drab.  1 shoe laces.  2 pair of socks.  1 pair of shoes (tan).    Any other article that may be prescribed by the company commander.    The surplus kit of each man will be made up into a neat, compact bundle,  tied with a string (use a shoe string for the purpose), and tagged with  the owner's name. These individual kits will be packed in a laundry bag,  called \"surplus kit bag,\" tagged, one for each squad.         Contents of Blanket Roll         1. Extra blankets.         2. One ramrod for each squad.         3. Any other articles that may be prescribed by the company       commander.    Each squad makes these extra blankets, etc., into a long roll which is  called the \"squad blanket roll.\" A tag is tied to it, showing to what  regiment, company, and squad it belongs.      Notes    1. The bacon can is a convenient place to carry a small face towel,  shaving outfit, and other small toilet articles.    2. Keep your soap in a soap box.    3. Each squad should have its own cleaning material which should be tied  into a small package and carried in the surplus kit bag.    4. Interest in a hike or a manoeuver will be stimulated if at least one  member of each squad has a map showing all the camp sites and route of  march.    5. One man in each squad should be provided with a small bottle of  iodine, some absorbent cotton and adhesive tape for the common use of  the squad. This saves time for the surgeon and men in caring for minor  injuries, scratches, etc.        ESPRIT DE CORPS      Have too much esprit de corps to complain of the length of the march, or  to kick about the dust on the road. Be self-controlled. Don't boast of  your ability to march on forever. Such remarks are depressing to a tired  comrade who is not as physically strong as you.          CHAPTER XI    OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS        To make it possible to fill the gaps made in the Regular Army, by the  heavy loss of commissioned officers which is inevitable in time of war  and to make it possible to train large volunteer armies which are called  into existence when war is imminent or actually upon the country, the  Government has provided for an Officers' Reserve Corps.    It is, indeed, a patriotic and far-sighted act on the part of a citizen  to become a reserve officer, for, by so doing, he will increase his  measure of usefulness for the time when his country will need him most  and when he will, if he is a real, virile man, desire to be of the  utmost service to his country.    The President alone is authorized to appoint officers in the Reserve  Corps. Each officer must be physically, mentally, and morally qualified  to hold his commission. The highest rank in the reserve corps will be  that of major.    Age limits for appointment in the line of the Reserve Corps:    2nd Lieutenants must be under 32 years of age.    1st Lieutenants must be under 36 years of age.    Captains must be under 40 years of age.    Majors must be under 45 years of age.    Any citizen who thinks that he has the necessary qualifications and  desires to become a reserve officer should apply to the Commanding  General of the Department wherein he resides for an application blank  and all information pertaining thereto.    You must undergo a course of training in camp. We advise you in the  strongest terms to go to camp as soon as possible. There are no short  cuts in the military business. The most efficient instruction under the  most ideal conditions with the most competent officers, will be found  only in camp.        GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS      An officer in the Reserve Corps cannot, without his consent, be called  into service in a lower grade than that held by him in the Reserve  Corps.    When a Reserve Officer reaches the age limit fixed for appointment or  reappointment in the grade in which commissioned, he will be honorably  discharged from the service of the United States and he will be entitled  to retain his official title, and, on occasions of ceremony, to wear the  uniform of the highest grade he held in the Reserve Corps. The preceding  provisions as to ages of officers do not apply to the appointment or  reappointment of officers of the Quartermaster, Engineer, Ordnance,  Signal, Judge Advocate, and Medical Sections of the Reserve Corps.    A commission in the Reserve Corps will cover a period of five years,  except as provided in the preceding paragraph, unless sooner terminated  in the discretion of the President. An officer may be recommissioned,  either in the same or a higher grade for successive periods of five  years, subject to examination and age limits.    To become eligible for appointment as an officer of the Officers'  Reserve Corps a man must be not less than twenty-one years of age and  must be a citizen of the United States.        THE OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS IN WAR      In time of actual or threatened hostilities the President can order  officers of the Reserve Corps to temporary duty with the Regular Army,  or as officers at recruiting rendezvous and depots, or on such duty as  he may prescribe. An officer thus called into service receives the same  pay and allowances as an officer of the same rank in the Regular Army.  When thus called out Reserve Officers may be promoted in rank to  vacancies in volunteer organizations. Retired officers of the Officers'  Reserve Corps are not entitled to retired pay but are entitled to  pensions for disability incurred in line of duty and while in active  service. When called out for active service an officer in the Reserve  Corps will be required to obey the laws and regulations for the  government of the Army of the United States in so far as they are  applicable to officers whose permanent retention in the military service  is not contemplated.        THE OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS IN PEACE      During peace the Secretary of War can order any Reserve Officer to duty  for instruction for a period not to exceed fifteen days in any one  calendar year. While so serving, an officer will receive the pay and  allowance of his grade in the Regular Army. This period of service may  be extended with the consent of the Reserve Officer. By thus extending  such periods of instruction a Reserve Officer may, at the conclusion  thereof, be examined for promotion to the next higher grade.        EXAMINATIONS      Each applicant for a commission in the Reserve Corps will be given a  rigid physical examination. Make certain that you can pass such an  examination. Go to your family physician and get him to examine you.    The examinations for Reserve Corps commissions are for the purpose of  ascertaining the practical ability of the applicant. The record of all  the service and training the applicant has had at training camps is  considered as part of the examination.    Those desiring to enter the Officers' Reserve Corps may elect any of the  following sections:     1. Infantry Officers' Reserve Corps.   2. Cavalry Officers' Reserve Corps.   3. Field Artillery Officers' Reserve Corps.   4. Coast Artillery Officers' Reserve Corps.   5. Medical (to include the reserve officers of the Medical Corps, Dental      Corps, and Veterinary Corps) Officers' Reserve Corps.   6. Adjutant General's Officers' Reserve Corps.   7. Judge Advocate General's Officers' Reserve Corps.   8. Inspector General's Officers' Reserve Corps.   9. Quartermaster Officers' Reserve Corps.  10. Engineer Officers' Reserve Corps.  11. Ordnance Officers' Reserve Corps.  12. Signal Officers' Reserve Corps.        REPORTS TO BE MADE      Officers in the Officers' Reserve Corps are required to report at once  to the Adjutant General of the Department in which they live or to the  heads of the Staff Corps or Departments to which they may belong of any  permanent change of address. If a change of address to any other  department is involved the adjutant of each department should be  notified.        THE RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS      The President is authorized to establish and maintain in civil  educational institutions a Reserve Officers' Training Corps which shall  consist of senior and junior divisions.        SENIOR DIVISION      A senior division of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps may be  established at any university and college requiring of its students four  years of collegiate study for a degree, and at essentially military  schools which, as a result of annual inspection of such institutions by  the War Department, are especially designated as qualified to establish  a unit of the senior division. Authorities of the former (universities  and colleges not essentially military) must establish and maintain a two  years' elective or compulsory course of military training, as a minimum,  for its physically fit male students. This course, when entered upon,  must in the case of"]]]
