Rain every day, and often at night; I could not travel now, even if I  had men, but I could make some progress; this is the sorest delay I ever  had. I look above for help and mercy.    [The wearied man tried to while away the time by gaining little scraps  of information from the Arabs and the natives, but we cannot fail to see  what a serious stress was all the time put upon his constitution under  these circumstances; the reader will pardon the disjointed nature of  his narrative, written as it was under the greatest disadvantage.]      Lion's fat is regarded as a sure preventive of tsetse or bungo. This was  noted before, but I add now that it is smeared on the ox's tail, and  preserves hundreds of the Banyamwesi cattle in safety while going to the  coast; it is also used to keep pigs and hippopotami away from gardens:  the smell is probably the efficacious part in \"Heresi,\" as they call it.    _12th December, 1870._--It may be all for the best that I am so  hindered, and compelled to inactivity.    An advance to Lohombo was the furthest point of traders for many a day,  for the slaves returning with ivory were speared mercilessly by  Manyuema, because they did not know guns could kill, and their spears  could. Katomba coming to Moenekuss was a great feat three or four years  ago; then Dugumbe went on to Lualaba, and fought his way, so I may be  restrained now in mercy till men come.    The Neggeri, an African animal, attacks the tenderest parts of man and  beast, cuts them off, and retires contented: buffaloes are often  castrated by him. Men who know it, squat down, and kill him with knife  or gun. The Zibu or mbuide flies at the tendon Achilles; it is most  likely the Ratel.    The Fisi ea bahari, probably the seal, is abundant in the seas, but the  ratel or badger probably furnished the skins for the Tabernacle: bees  escape from his urine, and he eats their honey in safety; lions and all  other animals fear his attacks of the heel.    The Babemba mix a handful (about twenty-five to a measure) of castor-oil  seeds with the dura and meleza they grind, and usage makes them like it,  the nauseous taste is not perceptible in porridge; the oil is needed  where so much farinaceous or starchy matter exists, and the bowels are  regulated by the mixture: experience has taught them the need of a fatty  ingredient.    [Dr. Livingstone seems to have been anxious to procure all the  information possible from the Arabs respecting the powerful chief  Merere, who is reported to live on the borders of the Salt Water Lake,  which lies between Lake Tanganyika and the East Coast. It would seem as  if Merere held the most available road for travellers passing to the  south-west from Zanzibar, and although the Doctor did not go through his  country, he felt an interest no doubt in ascertaining as much as he  could for the benefit of others.]    Goambari is a prisoner at Merere's, guarded by a thousand or more men,  to prevent him intriguing with Monyungo, who is known as bloodthirsty.  In the third generation Charura's descendants numbered sixty able-bodied  spearmen, Garahenga or Kimamure killed many of them. Charura had six  white attendants with him, but all died before he did, and on becoming  chief he got all his predecessor's wives. Merere is the son of a woman  of the royal stock, and of a common man, hence he is a shade or two  darker than Charura's descendants, who are very light coloured, and have  straight noses. They shave the head, and straight hair is all cut off;  they drink much milk, warm, from the teats of the cows, and think that  it is strengthening by its heat.    _December 23rd, 1870._--Bambarre people suffer hunger now because they  will not plant cassava; this trading party eats all the maize, and sends  to a distance for more, and the Manyuema buy from them with malofu, or  palm-toddy. Rice is all coming into ear, but the Manyuema planted none:  maize is ripening, and mice are a pest. A strong man among the Manyuema  does what he pleases, and no chief interferes: for instance, a man's  wife for ten goats was given off to a Mene man, and his child, now  grown, is given away, too; he comes to Mohamad for redress! Two  elephants killed were very large, but have only small tusks: they come  from the south in the rains. All animals, as elephants, buffaloes, and  zebras, are very large in the Basango country; tusks are full in the  hollows, and weigh very heavy, and animals are fat and good in flesh:  eleven goats are the exchange for the flesh of an elephant.    [The following details respecting ivory cannot fail to be interesting  here: they are very kindly furnished by Mr. F.D. Blyth, whose long  experience enables him to speak with authority upon the subject. He  says, England imports about 550 tons of ivory annually,--of this 280  tons pass away to other countries, whilst the remainder is used by our  manufacturers, of whom the Sheffield cutlers alone require about 170  tons. The whole annual importation is derived from the following  countries, and in the quantities given below, as near as one can  approach to actual figures:        Bombay and Zanzibar export      160 tons.      Alexandria and Malta            180 \"      West Coast of Africa            140 \"      Cape of Good Hope                50 \"      Mozambique                       20 \"    The Bombay merchants collect ivory from all the southern countries of  Asia, and the East Coast of Africa, and after selecting that which is  most suited to the wants of the Indian and Chinese markets, ship the  remainder to Europe.    From Alexandria and Malta we receive ivory collected from Northern and  Central Africa, from Egypt, and the countries through which the Nile  flows.    Immediately after the Franco-German war the value of ivory increased  considerably; and when we look at the prices realized on large Zanzibar  tusks at the public sales, we can well understand the motive power which  drove the Arab ivory hunters further and further into the country from  which the chief supply was derived when Dr. Livingstone met them.        In 1867 their price varied from L39 to L42.       \" 1868    \"   \"     \"      \"    39  \"  42.       \" 1869    \"   \"     \"      \"    41  \"  44.       \" 1870    \"   \"     \"      \"    do. \"  do.       \" 1871    \"   \"     \"      \"    do. \"  do.       \" 1872    \"   \"     \"      \"    58  \"  61.       \" 1873    \"   \"     \"      \"    68  \"  72.       \" 1874    \"   \"     \"      \"    53  \"  58.    Single tusks vary in weight from 1 lb. to 165 lbs.: the average of a  pair of tusks may be put at 28 lbs., and therefore 44,000 elephants,  large and small, must be killed yearly to supply the ivory which _comes  to England alone_, and when we remember that an enormous quantity goes  to America, to India and China, for consumption there, and of which we  have no account, some faint notion may be formed of the destruction that  goes on amongst the herds of elephants.    Although naturalists distinguish only two living species of elephants,  viz. the African and the Asiatic, nevertheless there is a great  difference in the size, character, and colour of their tusks, which may  arise from variations in climate, soil, and food. The largest tusks are  yielded by the African elephant, and find their way hither from the port  of Zanzibar: they are noted for being opaque, soft or \"mellow\" to work,  and free from cracks or defects.    The tusks from India, Ceylon, &c, are smaller in size, partly of an  opaque character, and partly translucent (or, as it is technically  called \"bright\"), and harder and more cracked, but those from Siam and  the neighbouring countries are very \"bright,\" soft, and fine grained;  they are much sought after for carvings and ornamental work. Tusks from  Mozambique and the Cape of Good Hope seldom exceed 70 lbs. in weight  each: they are similar in character to the Zanzibar kind.    Tusks which come through Alexandria and Malta differ considerably in  quality: some resemble those from Zanzibar, whilst others are white and  opaque, harder to work, and more cracked at the points; and others again  are very translucent and hard, besides being liable to crack: this  latter description fetches a much lower price in the market.    From the West Coast of Africa we get ivory which is always translucent,  with a dark outside or coating, but partly hard and partly soft.    The soft ivory which comes from Ambriz, the Gaboon River, and the ports  south of the equator, is more highly valued than any other, and is  called \"silver grey\": this sort retains its whiteness when exposed to  the air, and is free from that tendency to become yellowish in time  which characterises Asiatic and East African ivory.    Hard tusks, as a rule, are proportionately smaller in diameter, sharper,  and less worn than soft ones, and they come to market much more cracked,  fetching in consequence a lower price.    In addition to the above a few tons of Mammoth ivory are received from  time to time from the Arctic regions and Siberia, and although of  unknown antiquity, some tusks are equal in every respect to ivory which  is obtained in the present day from elephants newly killed; this, no  doubt, is owing to the preservative effects of the ice in which the  animals have been imbedded for many thousands of years. In the year 1799  the entire carcase of a mammoth was taken from the ice, and the skeleton  and portions of the skin, still covered with reddish hair, are preserved  in the Museum of St. Petersburg: it is said that portions of the flesh  were eaten by the men who dug it out of the ice.]      _24th December, 1870._--Between twenty-five and thirty slaves have died  in the present epidemic, and many Manyuema; two yesterday at Kandawara.  The feet swell, then the hands and face, and in a day or two they drop  dead; it came from the East, and is very fatal, for few escape"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#18)"],[1,"discovery! The transport of waking to it, and waking  refreshed! The swift and sudden miracle that it seemed! I shall never,  never forget it, still less the sickening thrill of fear which was  cruelly quick to follow upon my joy. The cottage was still as the tomb.  What if I had slept too long!    With trembling hand I found my watch.    Luckily I had wound it in the early morning. I now carried it to the  window, drew back the blind, and held it in the moonlight. It was not  quite ten o'clock. And yet the cottage was so still--so still.    I stole to the door, opened it by cautious degrees, and saw the  reflection of a light below. Still not a sound could I hear, save the  rapid drawing of my own breath, and the startled beating of my own  heart.    I now felt certain that the Braithwaites were out, and dressed hastily,  making as little noise as possible, and still hearing absolutely none  from below. Then, feeling faint with hunger, though a new being after my  sleep, I remembered a packet of sandwiches which I had not opened on my  journey north. These I transferred from my travelling-bag (where they  had lain forgotten to my jacket pocket), before drawing down the blind,  leaving the room on tip-toe, and very gently fastening the door behind  me. On the stairs, too, I trod with the utmost caution, feeling the wall  with my left hand (my right was full), lest by any chance I might  be mistaken in supposing I had the cottage to myself. In spite of my  caution there came a creak at every step. And to my sudden horror I  heard a chair move in the kitchen below.    My heart and I stood still together. But my right hand tightened on  stout wood, my right forefinger trembled against thin steel. The sound  was not repeated. And at length I continued on my way down, my teeth  set, an excuse on my lips, but determination in every fibre of my frame.    A shadow lay across the kitchen floor; it was that of the deaf mute, as  he stood on a chair before the fire, supporting himself on the chimney  piece with one puny arm, while he reached overhead with the other. I  stood by for an instant, glorying in the thought that he could not hear  me; the next, I saw what it was he was reaching up for--a bell-mouthed  blunderbuss--and I knew the little devil for the impostor that he was.    \"You touch it,\" said I, \"and you'll drop dead on that hearth.\"    He pretended not to hear me, but he heard the click of the splendid  spring which Messrs. Deane and Adams had put into that early revolver of  theirs, and he could not have come down much quicker with my bullet in  his spine.    \"Now, then,\" I said, \"what the devil do you mean by shamming deaf and  dumb?\"    \"I niver said I was owt o' t' sort,\" he whimpered, cowering behind the  chair in a sullen ague.    \"But you acted it, and I've a jolly good mind to shoot you dead!\"  (Remember, I was so weak myself that I thought my arm would break from  presenting my five chambers and my ten-inch barrel; otherwise I should  be sorry to relate how I bullied that mouse of a man.) \"I may let you  off,\" I continued, \"if you answer questions. Where's your wife?\"    \"Eh, she'll be back directly!\" said Braithwaite, with some tact; but his  look was too cunning to give the warning weight. \"I've a bullet to spare  for her,\" said I, cheerfully; \"now, then, where is she?\"    \"Gone wi' the oothers, for owt I knaw.\"    \"And where are the others gone?\"    \"Where they allus go, ower to t' say.\"    \"Over to the sea, eh? We're getting on! What takes them there?\"    \"That's more than I can tell you, sir,\" said Braithwaite, with so much  emphasis and so little reluctance as to convince me that for once at  least he had spoken the truth. There was even a spice of malice in his  tone. I began to see possibilities in the little beast.    \"Well,\" I said, \"you're a nice lot! I don't know what your game is, and  don't want to. I've had enough of you without that. I'm off to-night.\"    \"Before they get back?\" asked Braithwaite, plainly in doubt about his  duty, and yet as plainly relieved to learn the extent of my intention.    \"Certainly,\" said I; \"why not? I'm not particularly anxious to see your  wife again, and you may ask Mr. Rattray from me why the devil he led  me to suppose you were deaf and dumb? Or, if you like, you needn't say  anything at all about it,\" I added, seeing his thin jaw fall; \"tell him  I never found you out, but just felt well enough to go, and went. When  do you expect them back?\"    \"It won't be yet a bit,\" said he.    \"Good! Now look here. What would you say to these?\" And I showed him a  couple of sovereigns: I longed to offer him twenty, but feared to excite  his suspicions. \"These are yours if you have a conveyance at the end of  the lane--the lane we came up the night before last--in an hour's time.\"    His dull eyes glistened; but a tremor took him from top to toe, and he  shook his head.    \"I'm ill, man!\" I cried. \"If I stay here I'll die! Mr. Rattray knows  that, and he wanted me to go this morning; he'll be only too thankful to  find me gone.\"    This argument appealed to him; indeed, I was proud of it.    \"But I was to stop an' look after you,\" he mumbled; \"it'll get me into  trooble, it will that!\"    I took out three more sovereigns; not a penny higher durst I go.    \"Will five pounds repay you? No need to tell your wife it was five, you  know! I should keep four of them all to myself.\"    The cupidity of the little wretch was at last overcoming his abject  cowardice. I could see him making up his miserable mind. And I still  flatter myself that I took only safe (and really cunning) steps to  precipitate the process. To offer him more money would have been  madness; instead, I poured it all back into my pocket.    \"All right!\" I cried; \"you're a greedy, cowardly, old idiot, and I'll  just save my money.\" And out I marched into the moonlight, very briskly,  towards the lane; he was so quick to follow me that I had no fears of  the blunderbuss, but quickened my step, and soon had him running at my  heels.    \"Stop, stop, sir! You're that hasty wi' a poor owd man.\" So he whimpered  as he followed me like the little cur he was.    \"I'm hanged if I stop,\" I answered without looking back; and had him  almost in tears before I swung round on him so suddenly that he yelped  with fear. \"What are you bothering me for?\" I blustered. \"Do you want me  to wring your neck?\"    \"Oh, I'll go, sir! I'll go, I'll go,\" he moaned.    \"I've a good mind not to let you. I wouldn't if I was fit to walk five  miles.\"    \"But I'll roon 'em, sir! I will that! I'll go as fast as iver I can!\"    \"And have a conveyance at the road-end of the lane as near an hour hence  as you possibly can?\"    \"Why, there, sir!\" he cried, crassly inspired; \"I could drive you in our  own trap in half the time.\"    \"Oh, no, you couldn't! I--I'm not fit to be out at all; it must be a  closed conveyance; but I'll come to the end of the lane to save time,  so let him wait there. You needn't wait yourself; here's a sovereign  of your money, and I'll leave the rest in the jug in my bedroom. There!  It's worth your while to trust me, I think. As for my luggage, I'll  write to Mr. Rattray about that. But I'll be shot if I spend another  night on his property.\"    I was rid of him at last; and there I stood, listening to his headlong  steps, until they stumbled out of earshot down the lane; then back to  the cottage, at a run myself, and up to my room to be no worse than my  word. The sovereigns plopped into the water and rang together at  the bottom of the jug. In another minute I was hastening through the  plantation, in my hand the revolver that had served me well already, and  was still loaded and capped in all five chambers.          CHAPTER XIV. IN THE GARDEN      It so happened that I met nobody at all; but I must confess that my  luck was better than my management. As I came upon the beck, a new sound  reached me with the swirl. It was the jingle of bit and bridle; the beat  of hoofs came after; and I had barely time to fling myself flat, when  two horsemen emerged from the plantation, riding straight towards me in  the moonlight. If they continued on that course they could not fail  to see me as they passed along the opposite bank. However, to my  unspeakable relief, they were scarce clear of the trees when they turned  their horses' heads, rode them through the water a good seventy yards  from where I lay, and so away at a canter across country towards the  road. On my hands and knees I had a good look at them as they bobbed up  and down under the moon; and my fears subsided in astonished curiosity.  For I have already boasted of my eyesight, and I could have sworn that  neither Rattray nor any one of his guests was of the horsemen; yet the  back and shoulders of one of these seemed somehow familiar to me. Not  that I wasted many moments over the coincidence, for I had other things  to think about as I ran on to the hall.    I found the rear of the building in darkness unrelieved from within; on  the other hand, the climbing moon beat so full upon the garden wall, it  was as though a lantern pinned me as I crept beneath it. In passing I  thought I might as well try the gate; but Eva was right; it was locked;  and that made me half inclined to distrust my eyes in the matter of the  two horsemen, for whence could they have come, if not from the hall?  In any case I was well rid of them. I now followed the wall some little  distance, and then, to see over it, walked backwards until I was all but  in the beck; and there, sure enough, shone my darling's candle, close as  close against the diamond panes of her narrow, lofty window! It brought  those ready tears back to my foolish, fevered eyes. But for sentiment  there was no time, and every other emotion was either futile or  premature. So I mastered my full heart, I steeled, my wretched nerves,  and braced my limp muscles for the task that lay before them.    I had a"]]]
