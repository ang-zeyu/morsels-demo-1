But the boy contrived  a way to pick the lock--for a music-lover laughs at locksmiths--and at  night when all the household were safely in bed, he would steal  downstairs in his bare feet and get a sheet of the music and copy it off  by moonlight, sitting in the deep ledge of the window. Thus did he work  for six months, whenever the moon shone bright enough to read the lines  and signs and marks. But alas! one day the elder brother was rummaging  around the boy's room in search of things contraband and he pounced upon  the portfolio of copied music. He summoned the offender into his  presence. The facts were admitted, and Johann Sebastian had his bare  legs well tingled with an apple-sprout. Then the portfolio was  confiscated and carried away, despite pleadings, promises and tears. And  the question still remains whether \"discipline\" is not a matter of  gratification to the person in power rather than a sincere and honest  attempt to benefit the person disciplined.    Nevertheless, Johann Sebastian Bach was working out his own education:  he belonged to the boys' chorus at Ohrdruf, as all boys in the vicinity  did. Music in every German village was an important item, and the best  singers and best behaved members of the village choir were set apart as  a sort of select choir--a choir within a choir--and were often gathered  together to sing on special occasions at weddings and festivals. Johann  Sebastian had a sweet, well-modulated voice, and whenever he was to  sing, he carried his violin in the green bag, so he could play, too, if  needed. Thus he played and sang at serenades, just as did Martin Luther,  many years before, in Johann Sebastian's own native town of Eisenach.    Johann Sebastian's fame grew until it reached to Luneburg, twelve miles  away, and he was invited there to sing in the choir of Saint Michael's.  The pay he received was very slight, but that was not to be considered.  An occasional bowl of soup and piece of rye-bread, and the privilege of  sleeping in the organ-loft, all combined with freedom, made his paradise  complete. He played on the harpsichord in the pastor's study sometimes;  and occasionally the organist, who could not help loving such a  music-loving boy, would allow him to try the big organ, and at every  service he was present to play his violin, or if any of the other  players were absent he would just fill in and play any instrument  desired.    Then we hear of him trudging off to Hamburg, a hundred miles away, with  only a few coppers in his pocket, to hear the great organist Reinke. He  slept in cattle-sheds by the way, played his violin at taverns for  something to eat, or plainly stated his case to sympathetic cooks at  backdoors. One instance he has recorded when all the world seemed to  frown. He had trudged all day, with nothing to eat, and at evening had  sat down near the open window of an inn, from which came savory smells  of supper. As he sat there, suddenly there were thrown out a couple of  small dried herrings. The hungry boy eagerly seized upon them, just as a  dog would. But what was his surprise to find, as he gnawed, in the mouth  of each fish a piece of silver! Some one had read the story of Saint  Peter to a purpose. Young Bach looked in vain for a person to thank, but  perceiving no one he took it as the act of God and an omen that his  pilgrimage to hear the great organist should not be in vain.    The wonders of Reinke's playing and the marvel of the mighty music  filled his soul with awe, and fired his ambition to do a like  performance.    Did the great Reinke know as he played that bright Sabbath morning,  filling the cathedral with thunders of echoing bass, or sounds of sweet,  subtle melody--did he know that away back in the throng stood a dusty,  tawny-haired boy who had tramped a hundred miles just for this event?  And did the organist guess as he played that he was inspiring a human  soul to do a grand and wondrous work, and live a life whose influence  should be deathless? Probably not--few men indeed know when virtue has  gone out of them.    Perhaps Reinke was playing just to suit himself, and had purposely put  the unappreciative, lazy, sleepy occupants of the pews out of his  thought, all unmindful that there was one among a thousand, back behind  a pillar, dusty and worn, but now unconsciously refreshed and oblivious  to all save the playing of the great organ. There stood the boy bathed  in sweet sounds, with streaming eyes and responsive heart.    His inward emotions supplemented the outward melody, for music demands a  listener, and at the last is a matter of soul, not sound: its appeal  being a harmony that dwells within. So played Reinke, and back by the  door, peering from behind a pillar, stood the boy.           *       *       *       *       *    Sebastian Bach was such a useful member of the choir at Luneburg that  the town musician from Weimar, who happened to be going that way,  induced him to go home with him as assistant organist.    This was a definite move in the direction of fame and fortune. Men who  can make themselves useful are needed--there is ever a search for such.  They wanted Bach at Weimar. Johann Sebastian Bach, aged eighteen, was  wanted because he did his work well.    After three or four months at Weimar he made a visit to Arnstadt, where  his uncle had so long been organist. His name at Arnstadt was a name to  conjure with, and in fact throughout all that part of the country,  whenever a man proved to be a musician of worth and power the people out  of compliment called him a \"Bach.\"    Johann Sebastian was invited to play for the people, and all were so  delighted that they insisted he should come and fill the place made  vacant by the death of the \"Great Bach.\"    So he came and was duly installed.    And the young man drilled his chorus, wrote cantatas, and arranged  chants and hymns. But he was far from contented. He was being pushed on  by a noble unrest. It was not so very long before we find him packing  off to Denmark, with little ceremony, to listen to the playing of  Buxtehude, the greatest player of his age.    Bach had been quite content to tiptoe into the church when Reinke  played, grateful for the privilege of listening, half-expecting to be  thrust out as an interloper. He had gained confidence since then, and  now introduced himself to Buxtehude and was greeted by the octogenarian  as a brother and an equal, although sixty years divided them. His visit  extended itself from one week to two, and then to a month or more, and a  message came from his employers that if he expected to hold his place he  had better return.    Bach's visit to Buxtehude formed another white milestone in his career.  He came back filled with enthusiasm and overflowing with ideas and plans  that a single lifetime could not materialize. Those who have analyzed  the work of Buxtehude and Bach tell us that there is a richness of  counterpoint, a vigor of style, a fulness of harmony, and a strong,  glowing, daring quality that in some pieces is identical with both  composers. In other words, Bach admired Buxtehude so much that for a  time he wrote and played just like him, very much as Turner began by  painting as near like Claude Lorraine as he possibly could. Genius has  its prototype, and in all art there is to be found this apostolic  succession. Bach first built on Reinke; next he transferred his  allegiance to Buxtehude; from this he gradually developed courage and  self-reliance until he fearlessly trusted himself in deep water,  heedless of danger. And it is this fearless, self-reliant and  self-sufficient quality that marks the work of every exceptional man in  every line of art. \"Here's to the man who dares,\" said Disraeli. All  strong men begin by worshiping at a shrine, and if they continue to grow  they shift their allegiance until they know only one altar and that is  the Ideal which dwells in their own heart.           *       *       *       *       *    And now behold how Heinrich Bach had educated his people into the belief  that there was only one way to play, and that was as he did it. It is  not at all probable that Heinrich put forward any claims of perfection,  but the people regarded his playing as high-water mark, and any  variation from his standards was considered fantastic and absurd.    In all of the old German Protestant churches are records kept giving the  exact history of the church. You can tell for two hundred years back  just when an organist was hired or dismissed; when a preacher came and  when he went away, with minute mention as to reasons.    And so we find in the records of the Church at Arnstadt that the  organist, Johann Sebastian Bach, took a vacation without leave in the  year Seventeen Hundred Five, and further, when he returned his playing  was \"fantastical.\"    With the young man's compositions the Consistory expressed echoing  groans of dissatisfaction. A list of charges was drawn up against him,  one of which runs as follows: \"We charge him with a habit of making  surprising variations in the chorales, and intermixing divers strange  sounds, so that thereby the congregation was confounded.\"    Bach's answers are filed with the original charges, and are all very  brief and submissive. In some instances he pleads guilty, not thinking  it worth his while, strong man that he was, to either apologize or  explain.    But the most damning count brought against him was this: \"We further  charge him with introducing into the choir-loft a Stranger Maiden, who  made music.\" To this, young Bach makes no reply. Brave boy!    The sequel is shown that in a few weeks he was married to this \"Stranger  Maiden,\" who was his cousin. She was a Bach, too, a descendant of the  merry Hans, and she, also, played the organ. But great was the horror of  the Arnstadites that a woman should play a church organ.

Previously to the actual construction of the  college, he had maintained in temporary shelters numbers of poor  students. On the death of the Black Prince, whose fortunes he had  vigorously espoused, and the assumption of power by John of Gaunt,  Wykeham was impeached on the charge of embezzling the royal revenues,  accepting bribes, and the like; and the king laid hands on the  temporalities of his see. But almost the last act of Edward III. was to  restore what he had seized to the bishop, under certain conditions which  show the great wealth of the latter. Milman, in his \"Latin  Christianity,\" does full justice to the \"splendid, munificent prelate,  blameless in character,\" who devoted his vast riches to the promotion of  learning, and says that, though his endeavour to maintain the  hierarchical power over humanity was bitterly opposed by Wiclif, \"the  religious of England may well be proud of both.\" Wykeham was eighty  years of age when he died, and his body lies in the chantry erected by  his orders on the south side of the nave.    #Henry of Beaufort# (1405-1447), who followed Wykeham in the bishopric,  was the second son of John of Gaunt, by Catharine Swynford, and uncle of  Henry V. In 1398, at the early age of twenty-one, he was made bishop of  Lincoln, and in 1404 was translated to Winchester. During the reign of  Henry V. he thrice filled the office of chancellor. In 1417, when  ostensibly on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he was present at the Council  of Constance which was then considering the affairs of the church. At  this time he was offered the cardinal's hat by Martin V. and appointed  papal legate, but the bestowal of this dignity on him was resented by  the English monarch, who commanded him to surrender his office at  Winchester, which he declared was forfeited by his becoming a cardinal.  The dispute, however, was arranged, and \"the haughty cardinal, more like  a soldier than a man of the church,\" formally received his hat at Calais  in 1426. In the following year he led a crusade against the followers of  Huss in Bohemia, where, during the retreat of the great army from Mies,  he alone at the head of a band of English crusaders endeavoured, but in  vain, to arrest the utter rout. The death of Henry V. brought about a  fierce rivalry between the two great uncles, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester  and the cardinal bishop of Winchester, lasting until the death of the  former, which only occurred six weeks before that of Beaufort himself.  During the half-century of his rule at Winchester he rebuilt St Cross  and founded the \"Almshouse of Noble Poverty.\" Shakespeare has made  Beaufort a prominent figure in Parts I. and II. of \"Henry VI.,\" but, for  dramatic reasons, perhaps, he is painted very much blacker than he  deserved. That he was a militant ecclesiastic, scheming and  unscrupulous, is no doubt true; but he was a statesman and possessed  firmness of purpose, fertility of resource, and confidence in those whom  he selected to carry out his designs. His wealth was very great, for he  was able to lend his nephew the king L20,000, besides spending an  enormous amount in charities, including L400,000 devoted to the inmates  of London prisons.    #William of Waynfleete# (1447-1486), a student in Wykeham's colleges at  Winchester and Oxford, was first master of Winchester College, then made  provost of Eton in 1443, and in 1447 succeeded Beaufort in the bishopric  of Winchester. From 1449 to 1459, like his predecessor, he held the  chancellor's seal, and during the Wars of the Roses was a firm adherent  of Henry VI. His death took place in 1486. He founded Magdalen College,  Oxford, and possibly influenced Henry in his endowment of King's  College, Cambridge, and Eton. Waynfleete appears to have been a man of  great piety and learning, and, as Milman observes, his actions, in  advancing non-monastic institutions, reveal a sagacious fore-knowledge  of the coming changes in the temporal power of the church, and were  planned to maintain its supremacy in ways better adapted to the new  spirit which soon after his death caused the downfall of the religious  houses. The effigy of this bishop, in his chantry in the retro-choir,  has been restored.    #Peter Courtenay# (1486-1492) was translated from Exeter to Winchester,  but at neither see has he left any mark on the history, the  architectural work of his period being due chiefly to his priors.    #Thomas Langton# (1493-1500), translated hither from Salisbury, where he  was active against the adherents of Wiclif, was chosen in 1500 to occupy  the see of Canterbury, but he died of the plague before his translation,  and was buried in his chantry to the south of the Lady Chapel. He seems  to have been enthusiastic in the cause of education, since he is said to  have himself superintended the teaching of boys in his town.    #Richard Fox# (1500-1528) was bishop successively of Exeter, Bath and  Wells, and Durham before he was appointed to Winchester. Great  confidence was reposed in him by Henry VII., who chose him as godfather  of the future Henry VIII. To Fox is attributed the introduction of  Wolsey to the king. Yet this appears to have failed to win him the  cardinal's gratitude, for, according to Fuller: \"All thought Bishop Fox  to die too soon, only one excepted who conceived him to live too long,  Thomas Wolsey, who gaped for his bishopric.\" With Hugh Oldham, bishop of  Exeter, Fox was joint-founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, the  pelican in her piety, which appears on the college arms, being borne by  the bishop. His fine chantry and the reconstruction of the choir aisles  bear witness to his interest in the fabric of his cathedral, and he is  otherwise noted for the assistance he gave to various foundations.    [Illustration: CARVING ON CHOIR STALL IN LADY CHAPEL--BISHOP FOX'S WORK.  (From a Drawing by H.P. Clifford.)]    #Thomas Wolsey# (1529-1530) at length gained the coveted see, which he  held _in commendam_ with the archbishopric of York, but only for one  year.    #Stephen Gardiner# (1531-1555), another of the more famous prelates who  have held this see, is said to have been the illegitimate son of Bishop  Lionel Woodville of Salisbury, brother-in-law of Edward IV. Fuller, in  one of his favourite conceits, says that Gardiner retained in his wit  and quick apprehension the sharpness of the air at his birthplace of  Bury St Edmunds. In 1529 he became archdeacon of Norwich, and, owing to  his services to Cardinal Wolsey and Henry VIII., was appointed to  Winchester. On the whole, he managed to keep on good terms with the  king; but his famous six articles in support of the Real Presence sent  so many to the stake that the title of \"the bloody statute\" has clung to  them. During the reign of Edward VI. he was kept prisoner in the Tower,  and in 1550 was deprived of his bishopric, which was restored to him on  the accession of Mary, whom he crowned at Westminster. He performed also  the marriage service of Mary and Philip of Spain, mentioned on page 13.  \"His malice,\" says Fuller, \"was like what is commonly said of white  powder which surely discharged the bullet yet made no report, being  secret in all his acts of cruelty. This made him often chide Bonner,  calling him 'ass,' though not so much for killing poor people as for not  doing it more cunningly.\" Cruel and vengeful as he was, it is yet  possible that he has been rather unjustly accused of personal delight in  his victims' sufferings; but, while the persecutions under Mary continue  to be the worst chapter of English church history, the \"hammer of  heretics,\" as he was called, will always continue to be execrated. On  his death-bed at Westminster in 1555 he is reported to have said: \"I  have sinned with Peter, but I have not wept with him.\" It has indeed  been held that in his latter days he was half a Protestant at heart,  though this is difficult to establish. There is preserved a rather  amusing appeal of Gardiner to the Privy Council, dating from 1547. He  had intended to hold in Southwark a solemn dirge and mass in memory of  Henry VIII., and writes to complain that the players who flourished in  the neighbourhood say that they will also have \"a solemne playe to trye  who shal have most resorte, they in game, or I in earnest.\" During  Gardiner's imprisonment by Edward VI., #John Poynet#, once Cranmer's  chaplain, held his see. As the author of \"On Politique Power\" (1558),  where he pleads that \"it is lawful to kill a tyrant,\" and uses some very  immoderate language, Poynet may be remembered, but as an ecclesiastic he  has left only a discreditable record in his short term of office. He  died in 1556 in Germany, whither he had retired on the Roman Catholic  revival.    #John White# (1556-1559), who succeeded Gardiner, was deposed by Queen  Elizabeth. He was born at Farnham, and educated at Winchester. Though  personally he appears to have been pious, during his tenure of the see  four burnings of religious opponents took place in the diocese.    #Richard Horne# (1560-1580) was a very vigorous supporter of the  reformed religion, and suffered consequently under Mary. He appears to  have been very fanatical against the use of vestments, pictures, and  ornaments of all kinds. He may have pulled down the monastic buildings  at Winchester, less from a mistaken zeal than from motives of economy;  but his reputation in this respect is very bad.    #John Watson# (1580-1583), formerly a Doctor of Medicine, only held the  see for three years.    #Thomas Cooper# (1583-1594) was ordained on the accession of Elizabeth,  his Protestancy hindering him from taking holy orders under Mary. His  preaching abilities rapidly secured his promotion to the see of Lincoln  in 1570, and Winchester thirteen years later. He was buried in the  choir, but his monument has disappeared. He engaged in controversies  both with the \"recusants\" and with the Puritans.    #William Wickham# (1594-"]]]
