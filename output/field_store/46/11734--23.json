Yes, he was not mistaken; he heard voices  distinctly, and they appeared to be speaking in Spanish.  With something  like a bounding of the heart he repeated his shout, and renewed his  labours.    If he had known the character of the persons who had thus encouraged  him, his hopes would not have been so strong.    We have said that the entire town had been levelled by one tremendous  convulsion, and that in many places fires had broken out among the  ruins.  These fires sent up dense volumes of smoke, which naturally  attracted people from all quarters of the surrounding country.  Among  them came bands of desperate and lawless characters, who fastened on the  ruins as vultures seize on carrion.  They resembled the unclean birds in  more respects than one, for they went about as long as there was  anything of value to be seized, long after other people had been forced  to quit the place owing to the horrible stench of the hundreds of  corpses decaying, and in many cases burning, among the ruins.  (See note  1.)    It was the voices of some of these lawless ruffians that Lawrence had  heard.  He soon became aware of their character by the terrible oaths  which they used, and the fiendish laughter in which they indulged  whenever he called for help.  Knowing that he had nothing to hope from  such miscreants, he ceased to call out, but toiled none the less  vigorously to effect his deliverance.  At last he managed to scrape  through to the upper world; and a feeling of inexpressible relief filled  his breast as a bright ray of sunshine shot into his prison.    That it was daylight did not surprise him, for the many hours which he  had spent under ground seemed to him like weeks.  But he soon found that  he was not yet free.  The hole which he had scraped was much too small  to admit of the passage of even a little boy.  In trying to enlarge it,  he found, to his dismay, that on one side of it was an enormous beam, on  the other a mass of solid masonry, which could not be moved without aid.  Looking out, he saw nothing but confused heaps of smoking ruins, save  in one direction, where, in the far distance, (for the hotel had stood  on a mound), he could see a group of men engaged as if searching for  something.    To these he shouted again, but did not attract their attention.  Either  they did not hear him, or did not care.  Turning then to the beam, he  tried with all his might to raise it, but failed, though it moved  slightly.  Encouraged by hope, and afterwards influenced by despair, he  tried again and again, until his strength broke down.    At this juncture he heard footsteps, and saw a man passing near.    \"Senhor! senhor!\" he cried, in the best Spanish he could muster, \"aid me  to get out, for the love of God!\"    A coarse insult was the only reply as the man passed on.  A group of  other men who passed soon after behaved as badly, for they only laughed  at his entreaties.    It is difficult to say whether rage or indignation was more powerful in  Lawrence's heart, but both passions were equally unavailing in the  circumstances.  He felt this, and soon calmed down; so that when, half  an hour later, another man passed that way, he addressed him in tones of  respect and earnest entreaty.    The bandit, for such he was, seemed to be utterly unaffected; for  although he must certainly have heard the appeal, he, like the others,  passed on without taking the slightest notice.    \"Senhor! senhor!\" cried Lawrence, \"I have a gold watch and chain, to  which you--\"    The man stopped, for the bait took at once.  Turning, and walking  towards the place from which the sound came, he soon found the hole  through which our hero looked.    \"Hand out the watch, senhor,\" he said.    \"No, no,\" answered Lawrence; \"aid me first to lift the beam.\"    Whether the man understood the bad Spanish or not we cannot say, but  instead of helping to lift the beam, he drew a pistol from his belt, and  said--    \"Hand out the watch, or I shoot!\"    \"Shoot away, then,\" cried Lawrence, savagely, as he drew quickly back  into his hole.    The report of the pistol followed the words, and the ball caused a cloud  of dust and rubbish to mingle with the smoke.    A wild laugh of defiance from within told that our Englishman was not  hurt.    \"Ha--ha!  Shoot again,\" he cried, fiercely.    \"No, senhor, no.  You are brave.  I will help you,\" replied the  miscreant.    Lawrence doubted the honesty of the man's assurance, but of course  thanked him, and expressed readiness to avail himself of his assistance.  He kept carefully at the extreme end of the hole, however, while his  murderous deliverer removed some of the rubbish from the beam, and so  made it possible to raise it.  Remaining quite still, Lawrence waited  till he saw that the beam had been so far moved as to enlarge the space  sufficiently for him to get through.  Then, with a sudden spring _a la_  Jack-in-the-box, he leaped out, and stood before the astonished bandit.    Lawrence, whose sense of honour taught him to hold his promise as sacred  to a thief as to an honest man, had fully intended to give up his watch  and chain to the man if he should remain peaceably disposed; but the  bandit was not so disposed.  Recovering from his surprise, he drew a  second pistol from his belt and levelled it at Lawrence.    Thought is quick; quicker even than triggers.  His length of limb  happily flashed into the youth's mind.  Up went his foot with a sudden  kick, and away went the pistol into the air, where it exploded after the  manner of a sky-rocket!  The bandit did not wait for more.  He turned  and fled, much to the satisfaction of the victor, who, overcome by  prolonged exhaustive toil and excitement, sank down on a heap of  rubbish, and lay there in a semi-conscious state.  It seemed as if both  mind and body had resolved to find rest at all hazards, for he lay  perfectly motionless for nearly an hour,--not exactly asleep, but  without being fully conscious of connected thought.    From this state of repose, if it may be so called, he was partially  aroused by the voices of men near him, talking in coarse, violent  language.  Raising his head languidly, he observed a band of about eight  or ten villainous-looking fellows busy round a hole, out of which they  appeared to be drawing some sort of booty.    \"A prize!\" exclaimed one of the men; \"be gentle; she's worth taking  alive.\"    A loud laugh from the others roused Lawrence again, but a feeling of  unwonted exhaustion oppressed him, so that he scarce knew what it was he  heard.    Suddenly there arose a female voice, in a cry of pain.  Lawrence started  up on one elbow, and beheld Manuela struggling in the grasp of one of  the band.    If electric fire had taken the place of blood in his veins, he could not  have bounded up more quickly.  The shock seemed to renew and double his  wonted strength.  Like the English bull-dog, with terrible purpose, but  in absolute silence, he rushed over the rubbish towards the man who held  the struggling girl.  The man seemed to be a leader, being the only one  of the band who carried a cavalry sabre.  The others were armed, some  with short swords, some with carbines and pistols.    Swift though Lawrence was, the chief saw him coming.  He let go the  girl, and made a wild cut at him with the sabre.    Lawrence received the cut on his left arm.  At the same moment he struck  the villain such a blow with his clenched fist, that it seemed to crush  in his skull, and sent him headlong into the hole out of which they had  just dragged the Indian girl.  Fortunately he dropped his sabre as he  fell.  With a shout of defiance our hero caught it up, just in time to  arrest the descent of a carbine butt on his head.  Next moment the man  who aimed the blow was cleft to the chin, and a united rush of the  robbers was for the moment arrested.    Manuela, helpless and horror-struck, had stood motionless on the spot  where the chief had released her.  Lawrence caught her in his left arm,  swung her into an angle of the broken wall, placed himself in front, and  faced his foes.    The villains, though taken by surprise, were no cravens.  Apparently  they had already discharged their fire-arms, for only one fired at our  hero with a pistol, and missed his aim.  Flinging the weapon at his  adversary with a yell of disappointment, he missed his aim a second  time.  At the same moment another of the band--one of the tallest and  most ferocious-looking--sprang upon the youth with terrible fury.  He  knew well, apparently, how to use his weapon; and Lawrence felt that his  experience at school now stood him in good stead.  As the weapons of  these giants flew around with rapid whirl and clash, the others stood  aside to see the end.  Doubtless they would have taken unfair advantage  of their foe if they could, but Lawrence, turning his back to the wall,  where Manuela crouched, prevented that.  At last one dastardly wretch,  seeing that his comrade was getting the worst of it, bethought him of  his carbine, and began hurriedly to load.  Our hero noted the act, and  understood its fatal significance.  With a bound like that of a tiger he  sprang at the man, and cut him down with a back-handed blow, turning,  even in the act, just in time to guard a sweeping cut dealt at his head.  With a straight point he thrust his sword through teeth, gullet, and  skull of his tall adversary, until it stood six inches out behind his  head.  Then, without a moment's pause, he leaped upon the nearest of the  other bandits.    Awe-stricken, they all gave back, and it seemed as if the youth would  yet win the day single-handed against them all, when a shout was heard,  and half a dozen men of the same stamp, if not the same band, came  running to the rescue.    Lawrence drew hastily back to his protecting wall.    \"Pray, Manuela, pray,\" he gasped; \"we are in God's hands.\"    At that moment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#18)"],[1,"them.  And  look here,\" he added, pointing to the sides of the tank, which, for the  space of two inches above the water-level, were encrusted with salt,  \"you must carry your philosophy a little further, Ralph.  That water has  evaporated so much that it is too salt for anything to live in.  You  will require to add _fresh_ water now and then, in order to keep it at  the same degree of saltness as the sea.\"    \"Very true, Jack; that never struck me before,\" said I.    \"And, now I think of it,\" continued Jack, \"it seems to me that the  surest way of arranging your tank so as to get it to keep pure and in  good condition will be to _imitate_ the ocean in it; in fact, make it a  miniature Pacific.  I don't see how you can hope to succeed unless you  do that.\"    \"Most true,\" said I, pondering what my companion said.  \"But I fear that  that will be very difficult.\"    \"Not at all,\" cried Jack, rolling his towel up into a ball and throwing  it into the face of Peterkin, who had been grinning and winking at him  during the last five minutes--\"not at all.  Look here.  There is water  of a certain saltness in the sea; well, fill your tank with sea-water,  and keep it at that saltness by marking the height at which the water  stands on the sides.  When it evaporates a little, pour in _fresh_ water  from the brook till it comes up to the mark, and then it will be right,  for the salt does not evaporate with the water.  Then there's lots of  seaweed in the sea; well, go and get one or two bits of seaweed and put  them into your tank.  Of course the weed must be alive, and growing to  little stones; or you can chip a bit off the rocks with the weed  sticking to it.  Then, if you like, you can throw a little sand and  gravel into your tank, and the thing's complete.\"    \"Nay, not quite,\" said Peterkin, who had been gravely attentive to this  off-hand advice--\"not quite.  You must first make three little men to  dive in it before it can be said to be perfect; and that would be rather  difficult, I fear, for two of them would require to be philosophers.  But hallo! what's this?--I say, Ralph, look here!  There's one o' your  crabs up to something uncommon.  It's performing the most remarkable  operation for a crab I ever saw--taking off its coat, I do believe,  before going to bed!\"    We hastily stooped over the tank, and certainly were not a little amused  at the conduct of one of the crabs which still survived its companions.  It was one of the common small crabs, like to those that are found  running about everywhere on the coast of England.  While we gazed at it  we observed its back to split away from the lower part of its body, and  out of the gap thus formed came a soft lump which moved and writhed  unceasingly.  This lump continued to increase in size until it appeared  like a bunch of crab's legs; and, indeed, such it proved in a very few  minutes to be, for the points of the toes were at length extricated from  the hole in its back, the legs spread out, the body followed, and the  crab walked away quite entire, even to the points of its nipper-claws,  leaving a perfectly entire shell behind it, so that, when we looked, it  seemed as though there were two complete crabs instead of one.    \"Well,\" exclaimed Peterkin, drawing a long breath, \"I've _heard_ of a  man jumping out of his skin and sitting down in his skeleton in order to  cool himself, but I never expected to _see_ a crab do it!\"    We were, in truth, much amazed at this spectacle, and the more so when  we observed that the new crab was larger than the crab that it came out  of.  It was also quite soft, but by next morning its skin had hardened  into a good shell.  We came thus to know that crabs grow in this way,  and not by the growing of their shells, as we had always thought before  we saw this wonderful operation.    Now I considered well the advice which Jack had given me about preparing  my tank, and the more I thought of it the more I came to regard it as  very sound and worthy of being acted on.  So I forthwith put his plan in  execution, and found it to answer excellently well--indeed, much beyond  my expectation; for I found that after a little experience had taught me  the proper proportion of seaweed and animals to put into a certain  amount of water, the tank needed no further attendance.  And, moreover,  I did not require ever afterwards to renew or change the sea-water, but  only to add a very little fresh water from the brook, now and then, as  the other evaporated.  I therefore concluded that if I had been suddenly  conveyed, along with my tank, into some region where there was no salt  sea at all, my little sea and my sea-fish would have continued to thrive  and to prosper notwithstanding.  This made me greatly to desire that  those people in the world who live far inland might know of my wonderful  tank, and by having materials like to those of which it was made  conveyed to them, thus be enabled to watch the habits of those most  mysterious animals that reside in the sea, and examine with their own  eyes the wonders of the great deep.    For many days after this, while Peterkin and Jack were busily employed  in building a little boat out of the curious natural planks of the  chestnut-tree, I spent much of my time in examining with the  burning-glass the marvellous operations that were constantly going on in  my tank.  Here I saw those anemones which cling, like little red,  yellow, and green blobs of jelly, to the rocks, put forth, as it were, a  multitude of arms and wait till little fish or other small animalcules  unwarily touched them, when they would instantly seize them, fold arm  after arm round their victims, and so engulf them in their stomachs.  Here I saw the ceaseless working of those little coral insects whose  efforts have encrusted the islands of the Pacific with vast rocks, and  surrounded them with enormous reefs; and I observed that many of these  insects, though extremely minute, were very beautiful, coming out of  their holes in a circle of fine threads, and having the form of a  shuttlecock.  Here I saw curious little barnacles opening a hole in  their backs and constantly putting out a thin, feathery hand, with  which, I doubt not, they dragged their food into their mouths.  Here,  also, I saw those crabs which have shells only on the front of their  bodies, but no shell whatever on their remarkably tender tails, so that,  in order to find a protection to them, they thrust them into the empty  shells of whelks, or some such fish, and when they grow too big for one,  change into another.  But, most curious of all, I saw an animal which  had the wonderful power, when it became ill, of casting its stomach and  its teeth away from it, and getting an entirely new set in the course of  a few months!  All this I saw, and a great deal more, by means of my  tank and my burning-glass; but I refrain from setting down more  particulars here, as I have still much to tell of the adventures that  befell us while we remained on this island.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    NOTABLE DISCOVERY AT THE SPOUTING CLIFFS--THE MYSTERIOUS GREEN MONSTER  EXPLAINED--WE ARE THROWN INTO UNUTTERABLE TERROR BY THE IDEA THAT JACK  IS DROWNED--THE DIAMOND CAVE.    \"Come, Jack,\" cried Peterkin one morning about three weeks after our  return from our long excursion, \"let's be jolly to-day, and do something  vigorous.  I'm quite tired of hammering and bammering, hewing and  screwing, cutting and butting at that little boat of ours, that seems as  hard to build as Noah's ark.  Let us go on an excursion to the  mountain-top, or have a hunt after the wild ducks, or make a dash at the  pigs.  I'm quite flat--flat as bad ginger-beer--flat as a pancake; in  fact, I want something to rouse me--to toss me up, as it were.  Eh! what  do you say to it?\"    \"Well,\" answered Jack, throwing down the axe with which he was just  about to proceed towards the boat, \"if that's what you want, I would  recommend you to make an excursion to the waterspouts.  The last one we  had to do with tossed you up a considerable height; perhaps the next  will send you higher--who knows?--if you're at all reasonable or  moderate in your expectations!\"    \"Jack, my dear boy,\" said Peterkin gravely, \"you are really becoming too  fond of jesting.  It's a thing I don't at all approve of; and if you  don't give it up, I fear that, for our mutual good, we shall have to  part.\"    \"Well, then, Peterkin,\" replied Jack with a smile, \"what would you  have?\"    \"Have?\" said Peterkin.  \"I would _have_ nothing.  I didn't say I wanted  to _have_; I said that I wanted to _do_.\"    \"By the bye,\" said I, interrupting their conversation, \"I am reminded by  this that we have not yet discovered the nature of yon curious  appearance that we saw near the waterspouts on our journey round the  island.  Perhaps it would be well to go for that purpose.\"    \"Humph!\" ejaculated Peterkin, \"I know the nature of it well enough.\"    \"What was it?\" said I.    \"It was of a _mysterious_ nature, to be sure!\" said he with a wave of  his hand, while he rose from the log on which he had been sitting and  buckled on his belt, into which he thrust his enormous club.    \"Well, then, let us away to the waterspouts,\" cried Jack, going up to  the bower for his bow and arrows.--\"And bring your spear, Peterkin; it  may be useful.\"    We now, having made up our minds to examine into this matter, sallied  forth eagerly in the direction of the waterspout rocks, which, as I have  before mentioned, were not far from our present place of abode.  On  arriving there we hastened down to the edge of the rocks and gazed over  into the sea, where we observed the pale-green object still distinctly  visible, moving its tail slowly to and fro in the water.    \"Most remarkable!\" said Jack.    \"Exceedingly curious!\" said I.    \"Beats everything!\" said Peterkin.--\"Now, Jack,\" he added, \"you made  such a poor figure in your last attempt to stick "]]]
