If we are to succeed at last, labor, discipline,  and courage will all be required.\"    The negroes now besought the boys formally to take the command, and  promised to obey their orders, implicitly.    \"Well,\" Ned said, \"if you promise this, we will lead you. My friend  is older than I; and he shall be captain, and I will be first  lieutenant.\"    \"No, no,\" Gerald said. \"This must not be, Ned. I am the oldest, it  is true, by a few months; but you are far more active and quick  than I, and you have been the leader, ever since we left the ship.  I certainly will not take the command from you.\"    \"Well, we will be joint generals,\" Ned said, laughing; \"and I do  not think that our orders will clash.\"    He then explained, to the negroes and natives, the course which he  thought that they ought to pursue. First, every point at which the  enemy could be harassed should be provided with missiles. In the  second place, all signs of footsteps and paths leading to their  accustomed dwelling places should be obliterated. Thirdly, they  should fight as little as possible; it being their object to fight  when pursued and interfered with by small parties of Spaniards, but  to avoid conflict with large bodies.    \"Our object,\" he said, \"is to live free and unmolested here; and if  the Spanish find that, when they come in large numbers, they cannot  overtake us; and that, when they come in small ones, they are  defeated with loss; they will take to leaving us alone.\"    All agreed to this policy; and it was arranged that the women,  children, and most feeble of the natives should retire to almost  inaccessible hiding places, far in the mountains; and that the more  active spirits, with the negroes, and divided into five or six  bands, acting to some extent independently of each other, but yet  in accordance with a general plan, should remain to oppose the  passage of the enemy.    This, their first success over the Spaniards, caused a wild  exultation among the negroes and natives; and Ned and Gerald were  viewed as heroes. The lads took advantage of their popularity to  impress upon the negroes the necessity of organizing themselves,  and undergoing certain drill and discipline; without it, as they  told them, although occasionally they might succeed in driving back  the Spaniards, yet in the long run they must be defeated. It was  only by fighting with regularity, like trained soldiers, that they  would make themselves respected by the Spaniards; and the latter,  instead of viewing them as wild beasts to be hunted, would regard  them with respect.    The negroes, fresh from a success gained by irregular means, were  at first loath to undertake the trouble and pains which the boys  desired; but the latter pointed out that it was not always that the  enemy were to be caught napping, and that after such a check as had  been put upon them, the Spaniards would be sure to come in greater  numbers, and to be far more cautious how they trusted themselves  into places where they might be caught in a trap.    The weapons thrown away or left upon the ground, by the Spaniards,  were divided among the negroes; and these and the natives were now  formed into companies, natives and negroes being mixed in each  company, so that the latter might animate the former by their  example. Four companies, of forty men, each were formed; and for  the next fortnight incessant drill went on, by which time the  forest fugitives began to have a fair notion of the rudimentary  elements of drill. When the boys were not engaged upon this, in  company with one of the native chiefs they examined the mountains,  and at last fixed upon a place which should serve as the last  stronghold, should they be driven to bay by the enemy.    It was three weeks before there were any signs of the Spaniards. At  the end of that time a great smoke, rising from the signal hill,  proclaimed that a large body of the enemy were approaching the  forest. This was expected; for, two days before, three negro  runaways had taken shelter with them.    The negroes had been armed with long pikes of tough wood, sharpened  in the fire, and capable of inflicting fully as deadly a wound as  those carried by the Spaniards. Each carried a club, the leaders  being armed with the swords taken from the Spaniards; while there  were also eight arquebuses, which had been gained from the same  source. All the natives bore bows and arrows, with which they were  able to shoot with great accuracy. The negroes were not skilled  with these weapons; but were more useful, from their greater  strength, for hurling down rocks and missiles upon the Spaniards,  when below.    A consultation had been previously held, as to the course to be  taken in case of the approach of the enemy. It was determined as  far as possible to avoid fighting, to allow the Spaniards to tramp  from place to place, and then to harass them by falling upon them  in the night, disturbing their sleep, cutting down sentries; and  harassing them until they were forced, by pure exhaustion, to leave  the forest.    These tactics were admirably adapted to the nature of the contest.  The only thing which threatened to render them nugatory was the  presence of the fierce dogs of the Spaniards. Preparations had  already been made for checking the bloodhounds in pursuit of  fugitive slaves. In a narrow place, in one of the valleys at the  entrance of the forest, a somewhat heavy gallery had been erected.  This was made of wood heaped with great stones, and was so arranged  that any animal running through it would push aside a stick, which  acted as a trigger. This would release a lever, and the heavy logs  above would fall, crushing to death anything beneath it. A lookout  was always placed to intercept any fugitive slaves who might enter  the forest, and to guide them through this trap; which was, of  course, not set until after they had passed. This had been done in  the case of the two negroes who had arrived the previous day, and  the boys felt that any pursuit of them by bloodhounds would at once  be cut short, and the Spaniards left to their own devices.    This anticipation proved correct. The scouts reported that they  could hear, in the distance, the baying of dogs; and that,  undoubtedly, the enemy were proceeding on the track of the slaves.    The four companies were each told off, to positions considerably  apart from each other; while Ned and Gerald, with the cacique, or  chief, of the Indians, one negro, and four or five fleet-footed  young men, remained to watch the success of the trap.    This was all that they had hoped. The Spaniards were seen coming up  the glade, a troop two hundred strong. The leaders were on  horseback, some fifteen in number; and after them marched the  pikemen, in steady array, having men moving at a distance on each  flank, to prevent surprise.    \"This,\" said Ned, \"is a regular military enterprise. The last was a  mere pursuing party, gathered at random. It will not be so easy to  deal with cautious men, like these.\"    Three hounds ran ahead of the leaders, with their noses on the  ground, giving now and then the deep bay peculiar to their kind.  They reached the trap, and rushed into the gallery, which was some  twelve feet in length, and of sufficient height to enable a man on  foot to march through.    The leaders, on seeing the trap, drew in their horses, in doubt  what this structure could mean, and shouted to the hounds to stop.  But the latter, having the scent strong in their nostrils, ran on  without pausing. As the last hound disappeared in the gallery, a  crash was heard, and the whole erection collapsed, crushing the  hounds beneath it.    A cry of consternation and surprise burst from the Spaniards. The  artifice was a new one, and showed that the fugitives were assisted  by men with intellect far in advance of their own. The pursuit was  summarily checked, for the guides of the Spaniards were now gone.    The enemy paused, and a consultation took place among the leaders.  It was apparently determined to pursue their way alone, taking  every precaution, in hopes that the natives would attack them as  they had done the previous expedition; when they hoped to inflict a  decisive blow upon them. That they would, themselves, be able to  find the run-away negroes in the forest they had but small hope;  but they thought it possible that these would again take the  initiative.    First, under the guidance of one who had evidently been in the last  expedition, they took their way to the valley where the fight had  taken place. Here all was still. There were no signs of their foes.  They found, in the gorge, a great cairn of stones; with a wooden  cross placed over it, and the words in Spanish cut upon it:    \"Here lie the bodies of ten Spaniards, who sought to attack  harmless men in these woods. Let their fate be a lesson to those  who may follow their example.\"    This inscription caused great surprise among the Spaniards, who  gathered round the mound and conversed earnestly upon it; looking  round at the deep and silent woods, which might, for ought they  knew, contain foes who had proved themselves formidable. It was  evident that the soldiers, brave as they were, yet felt misgivings  as to the task upon which they had entered. They knew that two  Englishmen, a portion of the body which, under Drake, had rendered  themselves so feared, were leaders of these men; and so great was  the respect in which the English were at that time held, that this,  alone, vastly added to the difficulties and dangers which the  Spaniards saw awaiting them.    However, after a few minutes' consultation the party moved forward.  It was now formed in two bodies, about equally strong; one going a  quarter of a mile ahead, the other following it.    \"What have these men divided their forces for?\" the negro asked  Ned.    \"It seems to me,\" he answered, \"that they hope we shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#18)"],[1,"from the  beginning. Their fame spread from kingdom to kingdom like wild-fire. The  universities, colleges, and other learned societies fought with each  other for the privilege of entertaining these distinguished students. To  this very day, the address which the cat made on catapults and  cataplasms, before the professors of the University of Sagessa, is  remembered as one of the great events of the time; while the dog's  address on dogma before the assembled scholars of the Royal Academy of  Fairyland was printed in a special book bound in gold leaf and walpus  leather. Both the cat and the dog were awarded countless honorary  decorations.    And so, little by little, they came to a hilly land in which all the  streams raced pell-mell to the sea, and there they knew themselves to  be in the Kingdom of the Runaway Rivers. A three days' journey brought  them to the royal castle. Arriving in the twilight, they were somewhat  surprised to find a number of torchbearers waiting for them in the  castle courtyard. With great respect, these attendants conducted the cat  and the dog into a little ante-room, and then retired, leaving them  alone. A few minutes later, a very old woman, who, the animals noticed,  was stone-blind, came to take them before the king.    \"How strange!\" whispered the cat in its rather meouw-y voice.    \"Very,\" whispered back the dog in his deeper tone.    Having opened, one after the other, three great doors with three  different iron keys, the old woman, guiding herself by touching the wall  with her hand, led the animals into a long dark corridor. The cat, who  could see quite well in the dark, did not mind this, but the dog was not  particularly pleased. The echoes of the old woman's boots went rolling  along in the hollow darkness; the dog could hear his heart beat, and saw  his black companion's eyes glowing like pools of flame. Then, to their  mutual relief, the animals saw a point of light appearing far down the  passage, and on reaching this, they discovered a second blind old woman  holding a torch. The first old woman beckoned them to follow this new  guide, and disappeared again into the dark corridors by which they had  arrived.    The second old woman, lifting high the torch, first led her charges  through three more great doors, all of which she carefully locked behind  her. Soon the animals found themselves at the top of a winding stair  whose end was lost in darkness. Down this stair they went, turning, ever  turning, down and round, down and round, till both cat and dog felt  dizzily that they must have reached the heart of the earth. Then, little  by little, a pin-point of light began to glow brighter and brighter,  and the animals found themselves at the foot of the stairs and opposite  a little door. And there, by this door, stood another blind old woman,  who held a torch and beckoned to the animals to follow.    Three more doors they passed, the last one opening on a very narrow,  winding passage. In and out they turned, walking one behind the other,  for a time that seemed very, very long. Suddenly a narrow door appeared  in the winding wall, which opened inward as they drew near, revealing a  beautiful round chamber richly furnished and hung with the finest  tapestries. Beside the fireplace, in which a wood-fire was cheerily  burning, sat a gray-haired lady, who was no other than the Fairy Jocapa,  and in the centre of the room, reading a great book by the light of many  candles, sat a young man, the King.    In spite of the enchanter's careful training in manners, the cat and the  dog, I am sorry to say, almost stared for an instant at the King. Small  wonder that they did so, for the unfortunate young man lay under a  horrid spell, and his face and hands were not pink or white or  sun-brown, like yours or mine, but bright green, like a parrot's wing!    \"Welcome, O wonderful animals,\" said the enchanted King. \"Your fame has  gone before you into every land, and it is said that there is no  question you cannot answer. Listen, then, to my story and help me if you  can.    \"You see me before you, hideously changed. Until you entered here, an  instant past, no eyes but those of my aunt had beheld my horrible  countenance. It was she who caused this enchanted chamber to appear in  the heart of the foundations of my castle; and in this chamber I have  hidden since that terrible hour when the spell was put upon me. My  subjects only know that I am still alive. The Lord Chancellor rules the  kingdom in my stead. But hearken to my story.    \"Ten months ago, as I was driving my chariot down a narrow road built  along a river-bank close to the stream, I encountered a chariot being  driven furiously in the opposite direction. The driver of the chariot  was a tall, elderly man, wearing a wizard's cap; his face was red as  with anger, an evil light gleamed in his small malicious eyes. In order  to let him pass, I turned to one side, as near to the river-brink as I  dared; but the space was too narrow, our chariots locked wheels, and his  was overthrown. Turning upon me a face aflame with hatred, he cried out,  'I will teach you what it is to offend the Enchanter Zidoc'; and an  instant later the wizard himself, the struggling horses, and the  overturned chariot disappeared in a rumble of thunder and a great flash  of flame. I turned homeward, never noticing that anything had happened  to me. As I chanced to pass a roadside cottage, a little child playing  about saw me and ran, screaming for fear, to the door. A little farther  on, I stopped to drink of a spring. Judge of my horror when I leaned  over the clear pool of water and saw that my face had turned a bright  green! I waited till nightfall, stole into the castle unobserved, and  sought the aid of my aunt, the fairy. You know the rest. Speak, O  wonderful dog and wonderful cat, and bid me hope a little!\"    And the poor King hid his bright green face in his hands.    \"The Enchanter Zidoc is an old enemy of our dear master,\" said the white  dog, \"and his power as a sorcerer is the greatest in Fairyland!'    \"I have tried all my powers against him in vain,\" said the Fairy Jocapa,  sadly.    \"But let us not despair,\" broke in the cat. \"Zidoc is now to be found in  these dominions. His castle lies on the border of the Silver Hills. The  dog and I will go there, and see if we can help the King.\"    So the Fairy and the unhappy King thanked the wise animals, and sent for  the blind old women to lead them back to the upper world. Early next  morning, the famous pair began the journey to the Enchanter's den. The  dog's plan was to pretend to be but an everyday stray dog, and to this  end, he rolled several times in a mud-puddle; the cat, too, was to  appear as a stray cat, and neglected his fine black coat in order to  look the part.    Unfortunately for their plan, Zidoc had in his chamber a little  enchanted bell which rang shrilly when danger threatened him. Hearing  the bell ring late at night, Zidoc rose from his bed, and hurrying to  the turret window, saw, by the light of the waning moon, the dog and the  cat making their way to the castle through the wood. Rubbing his hands  with glee, he determined to let the two animals walk headlong into his  power, and then inflict upon them some terrible revenge.    The first day the dog went indoors, and concealed himself under a sofa,  while the cat remained outside. When twilight came, the dog ran out and  met the cat in the castle garden.    \"Did you discover anything?\" asked the cat.    \"Nothing whatever,\" replied the dog.    \"I will try to-morrow,\" said the cat.    And so, when the morning came, the dog remained outside while the cat  concealed himself behind a curtain. When the twilight came, the animals  met again.    \"Did you discover anything?\" asked the dog.    \"Very little,\" replied the cat. \"The Sorcerer Serponel is coming  to-morrow to pay Zidoc a visit. One of us must hide in the room in which  they will talk; for perhaps we may learn something which may help us to  lift the spell from the King.\"    \"To-morrow it is my turn,\" said the dog. And so the next morning he  stole into the house and hid again beneath the sofa.    Now Zidoc knew very well where the dog had concealed himself. Moreover,  he had summoned the powerful Serponel to his aid in order that the dog  and the cat should have no opportunity to escape.    When Serponel arrived, both the wicked enchanters went to the room in  which the dog lay concealed. First, Zidoc locked the only door with a  great key and then he said to Serponel,--    \"Brother, someone tells me that there is an enemy hidden under the  sofa.\"    \"Yes, brother,\" replied the dreadful Serponel.    \"And something tells me that it is time to let him feel your staff.\"    Now Zidoc had an enchanted staff whose blows were mortal, and knowing  this, the poor dog, who was trapped between the wall and the two  sorcerers, grew cold with fear to the tip of his white tail. Just as he  was about to make a bolt into the open, Zidoc dragged the sofa swiftly  aside, and aimed a terrible blow at him, which by the greatest good luck  just missed its mark. He then ran out into the room, pursued by the  sorcerers, who little by little forced him toward a corner.    And now, just as Zidoc, holding the staff uplifted, was about to strike  the poor dog with all his force, a black shape, with flaming eyes and  paws outstretched to scratch, leaped through the open window and landed  upon Zidoc's back. It was the brave cat, who had heard the fracas from  his hiding-place below and had clawed his way up the castle wall to help  his friend. Valiant Puss, forgetting in one instant, I must admit, all  its knowledge of languages, catastrophes, history, social deportment,  and agriculture, plunged instantly into the fray, and gave Zidoc a  frightful scratch, which so upset him that it caused him to drop his  staff, while the dog profiting by the confusion, and"]]]
