Through the haze of the vapor came her voice, more musical, more  plaintive than I had heard it before, but far softer, more tender:  still in her foreign tongue; the words unknown to me, and yet their  sense, perhaps, made intelligible by the love, which has one common  language and one common look to all who have loved--the love  unmistakably heard in the loving tone, unmistakably seen in the  loving face.    A moment or so more and she had come round from the opposite side  of the fire pile, and bending over Margrave's upturned brow, kissed  it quietly, solemnly; and then her countenance grew fierce, her  crest rose erect: it was the lioness protecting her young.  She  stretched forth her arm from the black mantle, athwart the pale  front that now again bent over the caldron--stretched it toward the  haunted and hollow-sounding space beyond, in the gesture of one  whose right hand has the sway of the scepter.  And then her voice  stole on the air in the music of a chant, not loud yet far-  reaching; so thrilling, so sweet and yet so solemn that I could at  once comprehend how legend united of old the spell of enchantment  with the power of song.  All that I recalled of the effects which,  in the former time, Margrave's strange chants had produced on the  ear that they ravished and the thoughts they confused, was but as  the wild bird's imitative carol, compared to the depth and the art  and the soul of the singer, whose voice seemed endowed with a charm  to inthrall all the tribes of creation, though the language it used  for that charm might to them, as to me, be unknown.  As the song  ceased, I heard from behind sounds like those I had heard in the  spaces before me--the tramp of invisible feet, the whir of  invisible wings, as if armies were marching to aid against armies  in march to destroy.    \"Look not in front nor around,\" said Ayesha.  \"Look, like him, on  the caldron below.  The circle and the lamps are yet bright; I will  tell you when the light again fails.\"    I dropped my eyes on the caldron.    \"See,\" whispered Margrave, \"the sparkles at last begin to arise,  and the rose hues to deepen--signs that we near the last process.\"      IX      The fifth hour had passed away, when Ayesha said to me, \"Lo! the  circle is fading; the lamps grow dim.  Look now without fear on the  space beyond; the eyes that appalled thee are again lost in air, as  lightnings that fleet back into cloud.\"    I looked up, and the specters had vanished.  The sky was tinged  with sulphurous hues, the red and the black intermixed.  I  replenished the lamps and the ring in front, thriftily, heedfully;  but when I came to the sixth lamp, not a drop in the vessel that  fed them was left.  In a vague dismay, I now looked round the half  of the wide circle in rear of the two bended figures intent on the  caldron.  All along that disk the light was already broken, here  and there flickering up, here and there dying down; the six lamps  in that half of the circle still twinkled, but faintly, as stars  shrinking fast from the dawn of day.  But it was not the fading  shine in that half of the magical ring which daunted my eye and  quickened with terror the pulse of my heart; the Bush-land beyond  was on fire.  From the background of the forest rose the flame and  the smoke--the smoke, there, still half smothering the flame.  But  along the width of the grasses and herbage, between the verge of  the forest and the bed of the water creek just below the raised  platform from which I beheld the dread conflagration, the fire was  advancing--wave upon wave, clear and red against the columns of  rock behind; as the rush of a flood through the mists of some Alp  crowned with lightnings.    Roused from my stun at the first sight of a danger not foreseen by  the mind I had steeled against far rarer portents of Nature, I  cared no more for the lamps and the circle.  Hurrying hack to  Ayesha I exclaimed: \"The phantoms have gone from the spaces in  front; but what incantation or spell can arrest the red march of  the foe speeding on in the rear!  While we gazed on the caldron of  life, behind us, unheeded, behold the Destroyer!\"    Ayesha looked and made no reply, but, as by involuntary instinct,  bowed her majestic head, then rearing it erect, placed herself yet  more immediately before the wasted form of the young magician (he  still, bending over the caldron, and hearing me not in the  absorption and hope of his watch)--placed herself before him, as  the bird whose first care is her fledgling.    As we two there stood, fronting the deluge of fire, we heard  Margrave behind us, murmuring low, \"See the bubbles of light, how  they sparkle and dance--I shall live, I shall live!\"  And his words  scarcely died in our ears before, crash upon crash, came the fall  of the age-long trees in the forest, and nearer, all near us,  through the blazing grasses, the hiss of the serpents, the scream  of the birds, and the bellow and tramp of the herds plunging wild  through the billowy red of their pastures.    Ayesha now wound her arms around Margrave, and wrenched him,  reluctant and struggling, from his watch over the seething caldron.  In rebuke of his angry exclamations, she pointed to the march of  the fire, spoke in sorrowful tones a few words in her own language,  and then, appealing to me in English, said:    \"I tell him that, here, the Spirits who oppose us have summoned a  foe that is deaf to my voice, and--\"    \"And,\" exclaimed Margrave, no longer with gasp and effort, but with  the swell of a voice which drowned all the discords of terror and  of agony sent forth from the Phlegethon burning below--\"and this  witch, whom I trusted, is a vile slave and impostor, more desiring  my death than my life.  She thinks that in life I should scorn and  forsake her, that in death I should die in her arms!  Sorceress,  avaunt!  Art thou useless and powerless now when I need thee most?  Go!  Let the world be one funeral pyre!  What to ME is the world?  My world is my life!  Thou knowest that my last hope is here--that  all the strength left me this night will die down, like the lamps  in the circle, unless the elixir restore it.  Bold friend, spurn  that sorceress away.  Hours yet ere those flames can assail us!  A  few minutes more, and life to your Lilian and me!\"    Thus having said, Margrave turned from us, and cast into the  caldron the last essence yet left in his empty coffer.    Ayesha silently drew her black veil over her face, and turned, with  the being she loved, from the terror he scorned, to share in the  hope that he cherished.    Thus left alone, with my reason disinthralled, disenchanted, I  surveyed more calmly the extent of the actual peril with which we  were threatened, and the peril seemed less, so surveyed.    It is true all the Bush-land behind, almost up to the bed of the  creek, was on fire; but the grasses, through which the flame spread  so rapidly, ceased at the opposite marge of the creek.  Watery  pools were still, at intervals, left in the bed of the creek,  shining tremulous, like waves of fire, in the glare reflected from  the burning land; and even where the water failed, the stony course  of the exhausted rivulet was a barrier against the march of the  conflagration.  Thus, unless the wind, now still, should rise, and  waft some sparks to the parched combustible herbage immediately  around us, we were saved from the fire, and our work might yet be  achieved.    I whispered to Ayesha the conclusion to which I came.    \"Thinkest thou,\" she answered without raising her mournful head,  \"that the Agencies of Nature are the movements of chance?  The  Spirits I invoked to his aid are leagued with the hosts that  assail.  A mightier than I am has doomed him!\"    Scarcely had she uttered these words before Margrave exclaimed,  \"Behold how the Rose of the alchemist's dream enlarges its blooms  from the folds of its petals!  I shall live, I shall live!\"    I looked, and the liquid which glowed in the caldron had now taken  a splendor that mocked all comparisons borrowed from the luster of  gems.  In its prevalent color it had, indeed, the dazzle and flash  of the ruby; but out from the mass of the molten red, broke  coruscations of all prismal hues, shooting, shifting, in a play  that made the wavelets themselves seem living things, sensible of  their joy.  No longer was there scum or film upon the surface; only  ever and anon a light, rosy vapor floating up, and quick lost in  the haggard, heavy, sulphurous air, hot with the conflagration  rushing toward us from behind.  And these coruscations formed, on  the surface of the molten ruby, literally the shape of a rose, its  leaves made distinct in their outlines by sparks of emerald and  diamond and sapphire.    Even while gazing on this animated liquid luster, a buoyant delight  seemed infused into my senses; all terrors conceived before were  annulled; the phantoms, whose armies had filled the wide spaces in  front, were forgotten; the crash of the forest behind was unheard.  In the reflection of that glory, Margrave's wan cheek seemed  already restored to the radiance it wore when I saw it first in the  framework of blooms.    As I gazed, thus enchanted, a cold hand touched my own.    \"Hush!\" whispered Ayesha, from the black veil, against which the  rays of the caldron fell blunt, and absorbed into Dark.  \"Behind  us, the light of the circle is extinct; but there, we are guarded  from all save the brutal and soulless destroyers.  But, before!--  but, before!--see, two of the lamps have died out!--see the blank  of the gap in the ring!  Guard that breach--there the demons will  enter.\"    \"Not a drop is there left in this vessel by which to replenish the  lamps on the ring.\"    \"Advance, then; thou hast still the light of the soul, and the  demons may recoil before a soul that is dauntless and guiltless.  If not, Three are lost!--as it is, One is doomed.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18350"],[0,"Social Life in the Insect World (#18)"],[1," to kill, like the knackers in the meat  factories, and if the staff numbered a hundred--a very modest figure as  compared with the staff of a lard or bacon factory--then the total  number of victims, in a day of ten hours, would be thirty-six thousand.  No Chicago \"cannery\" ever rivalled such a result.    The speed of assassination is the more remarkable when we consider the  difficulties of attack. The beetle has no endless chain to seize its  victim by one leg, hoist it up, and swing it along to the butcher's  knife; it has no sliding plank to hold the victim's head beneath the  pole-axe of the knacker; it has to fall upon its prey, overpower it, and  avoid its feet and its mandibles. Moreover, the beetle eats its prey on  the spot as it kills. What slaughter there would be if the insect  confined itself to killing!    What do we learn from the slaughter-houses of Chicago and the fate of  the beetle's victims? This: That the man of elevated morality is so far  a very rare exception. Under the skin of the civilised being there lurks  almost always the ancestor, the savage contemporary of the cave-bear.  True humanity does not yet exist; it is growing, little by little,  created by the ferment of the centuries and the dictates of conscience;  but it progresses towards the highest with heartbreaking slowness.    It was only yesterday that slavery finally disappeared: the basis of the  ancient social organism; only yesterday was it realised that man, even  though black, is really man and deserves to be treated accordingly.    What formerly was woman? She was what she is to-day in the East: a  gentle animal without a soul. The question was long discussed by the  learned. The great divine of the seventeenth century, Bossuet himself,  regarded woman as the diminutive of man. The proof was in the origin of  Eve: she was the superfluous bone, the thirteenth rib which Adam  possessed in the beginning. It has at last been admitted that woman  possesses a soul like our own, but even superior in tenderness and  devotion. She has been allowed to educate herself, which she has done at  least as zealously as her coadjutor. But the law, that gloomy cavern  which is still the lurking-place of so many barbarities, continues to  regard her as an incapable and a minor. The law in turn will finally  surrender to the truth.    The abolition of slavery and the education of woman: these are two  enormous strides upon the path of moral progress. Our descendants will  go farther. They will see, with a lucidity capable of piercing every  obstacle, that war is the most hopeless of all absurdities. That our  conquerors, victors of battles and destroyers of nations, are detestable  scourges; that a clasp of the hand is preferable to a rifle-shot; that  the happiest people is not that which possesses the largest battalions,  but that which labours in peace and produces abundantly; and that the  amenities of existence do not necessitate the existence of frontiers,  beyond which we meet with all the annoyances of the custom-house, with  its officials who search our pockets and rifle our luggage.    Our descendants will see this and many other marvels which to-day are  extravagant dreams. To what ideal height will the process of evolution  lead mankind? To no very magnificent height, it is to be feared. We are  afflicted by an indelible taint, a kind of original sin, if we may call  sin a state of things with which our will has nothing to do. We are made  after a certain pattern and we can do nothing to change ourselves. We  are marked with the mark of the beast, the taint of the belly, the  inexhaustible source of bestiality.    The intestine rules the world. In the midst of our most serious affairs  there intrudes the imperious question of bread and butter. So long as  there are stomachs to digest--and as yet we are unable to dispense with  them--we must find the wherewithal to fill them, and the powerful will  live by the sufferings of the weak. Life is a void that only death can  fill. Hence the endless butchery by which man nourishes himself, no less  than beetles and other creatures; hence the perpetual holocausts which  make of this earth a knacker's yard, beside which the slaughter-houses  of Chicago are as nothing.    But the feasters are legion, and the feast is not abundant in  proportion. Those that have not are envious of those that have; the  hungry bare their teeth at the satisfied. Then follows the battle for  the right of possession. Man raises armies; to defend his harvests, his  granaries, and his cellars, he resorts to warfare. When shall we see the  end of it? Alas, and many times alas! As long as there are wolves in the  world there must be watch-dogs to defend the flock.    This train of thought has led us far away from our beetles. Let us  return to them. What was my motive in provoking the massacre of this  peaceful procession of caterpillars who were on the point of self-burial  when I gave them over to the butchers? Was it to enjoy the spectacle of  a frenzied massacre? By no means; I have always pitied the sufferings of  animals, and the smallest life is worthy of respect. To overcome this  pity there needed the exigencies of scientific research--exigencies  which are often cruel.    In this case the subject of research was the habits of the Carabus  auratus, the little vermin-killer of our gardens, who is therefore  vulgarly known as the Gardener Beetle. How far is this title deserved?  What game does the Gardener Beetle hunt? From what vermin does he free  our beds and borders? His dealings with the procession of  pine-caterpillars promise much. Let us continue our inquiry.    On various occasions about the end of April the gardens afford me the  sight of such processions, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. I  capture them and place them in the vivarium. Bloodshed commences the  moment the banquet is served. The caterpillars are eviscerated; each by  a single beetle, or by several simultaneously. In less than fifteen  minutes the flock is completely exterminated. Nothing remains but a few  shapeless fragments, which are carried hither and thither, to be  consumed at leisure under the shelter of the wooden board. One well-fed  beetle decamps, his booty in his jaws, hoping to finish his feast in  peace. He is met by companions who are attracted by the morsel hanging  from the mandibles of the fugitive, and audaciously attempt to rob him.  First two, then three, they all endeavour to deprive the legitimate  owner of his prize. Each seizes the fragment, tugs at it, commences to  swallow it without further ado. There is no actual battle; no violent  assaults, as in the case of dogs disputing a bone. Their efforts are  confined to the attempted theft. If the legitimate owner retains his  hold they consume his booty in common, mandibles to mandibles, until the  fragment is torn or bitten through, and each retires with his mouthful.    As I found to my cost in bygone experiments, the pine-caterpillar wields  a violently corrosive poison, which produces a painful rash upon the  hands. It must therefore, one would think, form a somewhat highly  seasoned diet. The beetles, however, delight in it. No matter how many  flocks I provide them with, they are all consumed. But no one, that I  know of, has ever found the Golden Gardener and its larva in the silken  cocoons of the Bombyx. I do not expect ever to make such a discovery.  These cocoons are inhabited only in winter, when the Gardener is  indifferent to food, and lies torpid in the earth. In April, however,  when the processions of larvae are seeking a suitable site for burial and  metamorphosis, the Gardener should profit largely by its good fortune  should it by any chance encounter them.    The furry nature of the victim does not in the least incommode the  beetle; but the hairiest of all our caterpillars, the Hedgehog  Caterpillar, with its undulating mane, partly red and partly black, does  seem to be too much for the beetle. Day after day it wanders about the  vivarium in company with the assassins. The latter apparently ignore its  presence. From time to time one of them will halt, stroll round the  hairy creature, examine it, and try to penetrate the tangled fleece.  Immediately repulsed by the long, dense palisade of hairs, he retires  without inflicting a wound, and the caterpillar proceeds upon its way  with undulating mane, in pride and security.    But this state of things cannot last. In a hungry moment, emboldened  moreover by the presence of his fellows, the cowardly creature decides  upon a serious attack. There are four of them; they industriously attack  the caterpillar, which finally succumbs, assaulted before and behind. It  is eviscerated and swallowed as greedily as though it were a defenceless  grub.    According to the hazard of discovery, I provision my menagerie with  various caterpillars, some smooth and others hairy. All are accepted  with the utmost eagerness, so long as they are of average size as  compared with the beetles themselves. If too small they are despised, as  they would not yield a sufficient mouthful. If they are too large the  beetle is unable to handle them. The caterpillars of the Sphinx moth and  the Great Peacock moth, for example, would fall an easy prey to the  beetle were it not that at the first bite of the assailant the intended  victim, by a contortion of its powerful flanks, sends the former  flying. After several attacks, all of which end by the beetle being  flung back to some considerable distance, the insect regretfully  abandons his prey. I have kept two strong and lively caterpillars for a  fortnight in the cage of my golden beetles, and nothing more serious  occurred. The trick of the suddenly extended posterior was too much for  the ferocious mandibles.    The chief utility of the Golden Gardener lies in its extermination of  all caterpillars that are not too powerful to attack. It has one  limitation,"]]]
