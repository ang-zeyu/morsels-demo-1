[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18477"],[0,"The Science of Human Nature (#18)"],[1," a consideration of concrete cases.  Typewriting will serve very well the purpose of illustration. We shall  give the result of an actual experiment in which ten university students  took part. During their first half hour of practice, they wrote an  average of 120 words. At the end of forty-five hours of practice, they  were writing an average of 680 words in a half hour. This was an  increase of speed of 560 per cent. An expert typist can write about  3000 words in a half hour. Such a speed requires much more than  forty-five hours practice, and is attained by the best operators only.    [Illustration: FIGURE III.--LEARNING CURVES  The upper graph shows the improvement in speed of a group of students  working two half hours a day. The lower curve shows the improvement of a  group working ten half-hours a day.]    In the foregoing experiment, the students improved in accuracy also. At  the beginning of the work, they made 115 errors in the half hour. At the  end of the practice, with much faster speed, they were making only  327 errors in a half hour. The actual number of errors had increased  280 per cent. The increase in errors was therefore exactly half as much  as the increase in speed. This, of course, was a considerable increase  in accuracy, for while the speed had increased to 5.6 times what it had  been at the beginning, the errors had increased only 2.8 times. The  subjects in this experiment paid much more attention to speed than they  did to accuracy. If they had emphasized accuracy, they would have been  doing almost perfect work at the end of the practice, and their speed  would have been somewhat less. Practice, then, not only develops speed  but also develops accuracy.    There are also other results. At the beginning of work with the  typewriter, there is much waste of energy and much fatigue. The waste of  energy comes from using unnecessary muscles, and the fatigue is partly  due to this waste of energy. But even apart from this waste of energy,  an habituated act is performed with less fatigue. The various muscles  concerned become better able to do their work. As a result of  habituation there is, then, greater speed, greater accuracy, less waste  of energy, and less fatigue.    If we look not at the changes in our work but at the changes in  ourselves, the changes in our minds due to the formation of habits, we  find still other results. At the beginning of practice with the  typewriter, the learner's whole attention is occupied with the work.  When one is learning to do a new trick, the attention cannot be divided.  The whole mind must be devoted to the work. But after one has practiced  for several weeks, one can operate the typewriter while thinking about  something else. We say that the habituated act sinks to a lower level of  consciousness, meaning that as a habit becomes more and more fixed, less  and less attention is devoted to the acts concerned.    Increased skill gives us pleasure and also gives us confidence in our  ability to do the thing. Corresponding to this inner confidence is outer  certainty. There is greater objective certainty in our performance and a  corresponding inner confidence. By objective certainty, we mean that a  person watching our performance, becomes more and more sure of our  ability to perform, and we ourselves feel confidence in our power of  achievement.    Now that we have shown the results of habituation let us consider  additional illustrations. In piano playing, the stimuli are the notes as  written in the music. We see the notes occupying certain places on the  scale of the music. A note in a certain place means that we must strike  a certain key. At first the response is slow, we have to hunt out each  note on the keyboard. Moreover, we make many mistakes; we strike the  wrong keys just as we do in typewriting. We are awkward, making many  unnecessary movements, and the work is tiresome and fatiguing. After  long practice, the speed with which we can manipulate the keys in  playing the piano is wonderful. Our playing becomes accurate, perfect.  We do it with ease, with no unnecessary movements. We can play the  piano, after we become skilled, without paying attention to the actual  movements of our hands. We can play the piano while concentrating upon  the meaning of the music, or while carrying on a conversation, or while  thinking about something else. As a rule, pleasure and confidence come  with skill. Playing a difficult piece on the piano involves a skill  which is one of the most complicated that man achieves. It is possible  only through habituation of the piano-playing movements.    Nailing shingles on a roof illustrates well the various aspects of  habituation. The expert carpenter not only nails on many more shingles  in a day than does the amateur, but he does it better and with more  ease, and with much less fatigue. The carpenter knows exactly how much  he can do in a day, and each particular movement is certain and sure.  The carpenter has confidence in, and usually prides himself on, this  ability, thus getting pleasure out of his work.    The operations in arithmetic illustrate most of the results of  habituation. Practice in addition makes for speed and accuracy. In a few  weeks' time we can very much increase our speed and accuracy in adding,  or in the other arithmetical operations.    The foregoing examples are sufficient, although they could be multiplied  indefinitely. Almost any habit one might name would show clearly most of  the results enumerated. The most important aspects of habituation may be  summed up in the one word _efficiency_. Habituation gives us speed and  accuracy. Speed and accuracy mean skill. Skill means efficiency.    =How Habits Are Formed.= It is clear from the foregoing discussion that  the essential thing in a habit is the definiteness of the connection  between the stimulus and the response, between the situation and the  reaction to the situation. Our question now is, how is this definiteness  of connection established? The answer is, _through repetition_. Let us  work the matter out from a concrete case, such as learning to play the  piano. In piano playing the stimulus comes from the music as printed on  the staff. A note having a certain position on the staff indicates that  a certain key is to be struck. We are told by our music teacher what  keys on the piano correspond to the various notes on the staff, or we  may learn these facts from the instruction book. It makes no difference  how we learn them; but after we know these facts, we must have practice  to give us skill. The mere knowledge will not make us piano players. In  order to be skillful, we must have much practice not only in striking  the keys indicated by the various note positions, but with the various  combinations of notes. For example, a note on the second space indicates  that the player must strike the key known as \"A.\" But \"A\" may occur with  any of the other notes, it may precede them or it may follow them. We  must therefore have practice in striking \"A\" in all these situations. To  have skill at the piano, we must mechanize many performances. We must be  able to read the notes with accuracy and ease. We must practice so much  that the instant we see a certain combination of notes on the staff, our  hands immediately execute the proper strokes. Not only must we learn  what keys on the piano correspond to the various notes of the music, but  the notes have a temporal value which we must learn. Some are to be  sounded for a short time, others for a longer time. We have eighth  notes, quarter notes, half notes, etc. Moreover, the signature of the  music as indicated by the sharps or flats changes the whole situation.  If the music is written in \"A sharp\" then when \"A\" is indicated on the  staff, we must not strike the white key known as \"A,\" but the black key  just above, known as \"A sharp.\"    Briefly, in piano playing, the stimulus comes from the characters  printed on the staff. The movements which these characters direct are  very complicated and require months and years of practice. We must  emphasize the fact that practice alone gives facility, years of  practice. But after these years of practice, one can play a piece of  music at sight; that is, the first stimulus sets off perfectly a very  complicated response. This sort of performance is one of the highest  feats of skill that man accomplishes.    To get skill, then, one must practice. But mere repetition is not  sufficient. For practice to be most effective, one must put his whole  mind on what he is doing. If he divides his attention between the acts  which he is practicing and something else, the effect of the practice in  fixing and perfecting the habit is slight. It seems that when we are  building up a new nerve-path which is to be the basis of a new habit,  the nervous energies should not be divided; that the whole available  nervous energy should be devoted to the acts which we are repeating.  This is only another way of saying that when we are practicing to  establish a habit, we should attend to what we are doing and to nothing  else. But after the habit-connection is once firmly established, we can  attend to other things while performing the habitual act. The habitual  action will go on of itself. We may say, then, that in order to be able  to do a thing with little or no attention, we must give much attention  to it at first.    Another important factor in habit-formation is pleasure. The act which  we are practicing must give us pleasure, either while we are doing it or  as a result. Pleasurable results hasten habit-formation. When we  practice an act in which we have no interest, we make slow progress or  none at all. Now the elements of interest are attention and pleasure. If  we voluntarily attend to a thing and its performance gives us pleasure,  or pleasure results from it, we say we are interested in it. The secret  of successful practice is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18485"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#18)"],[1,"f'um way back yonder while de toddy lasts.    \"Slaves went to deir Marster's meetin's and sot in de back of de church.  Dey had to be good den 'cause Marster sho' didn't 'low no cuttin' up  'mongst his Niggers at de church. Ma said he didn't believe in whuppin'  his Niggers lessen it jus' had to be done, but den dey knowed he was  'round dar when he did have to whup 'em.    \"Ma said when dey had big baptizin's in de river dey prayed and shouted  and sung 'Washin' 'way my Sins,'--'Whar de Healin' Water Flows,' and  'Crossin' de River Jerdan.' De white preacher baptized de slaves and den  he preached--dat was all dere was to it 'ceppen de big dinner dey had in  de churchyard on baptizin' days.    \"When slaves died, dey made coffins out of pine wood and buried 'em whar  de white folkses was buried. If it warn't too fur a piece to de  graveyard, dey toted de coffin on three or four hand sticks. Yessum,  hand sticks, dat's what day called 'em. Dey was poles what dey sot de  coffin on wid a Nigger totin' each end of de poles. De white preacher  prayed and de Niggers sung 'Hark f'um de Tomb.'    \"Ma said she had a grand big weddin'. She wore a white swiss dress wid a  bleachin' petticoat, made wid heaps of ruffles and a wreath of flowers  'round her head. She didn't have no flower gals. Pa had on a long, frock  tail, jim swinger coat lak de preacher's wore. A white preacher married  'em in de yard at de big house. All de Niggers was dar, and Marster let  'em dance mos' all night.    \"I was de oldest of Ma's 10 chillun. Dey done all gone to rest now  'ceptin' jus' de three of us what's lef in dis world of trouble. Yessum,  dere sho' is a heap of trouble here.    \"Atter de War, Ma and Pa moved on Mr. Bill Marshall's place to farm for  him and dar's whar I was born. Dey didn't stay dar long 'fore dey moved  to Mr. Jim Mayne's place away out in de country, in de forks of de big  road down below Watkinsville. I sho' was a country gal. Yessum, I sho'  was. Mr. Mayne's wife was Mrs. Emma Mayne and she took a lakin' to me  'cause I was named Emma. I stayed wid her chilluns all de time, slep' in  de big house, and et dar too, jus' lak one of dem, and when dey bought  for dey chillun dey bought for me too.    \"Us wore homespun dresses and brass toed shoes. Sometimes us would git  mighty mad and fuss over our games and den Miss Emma would make us come  in de big house and set down. No Ma'am, she never did whup us. She was  good and she jus' talked to us, and told us us never would git to Heb'en  lessen us was good chillun. Us played games wid blocks and jumped de  rope and, when it was warm, us waded in de crick. Atter I was big  'nough, I tuk de white chillun to Sunday School, but I didn't go inside  den--jus' waited on de outside for 'em. I never got a chanct to go to  school none, but de white chilluns larnt me some.    \"Marse Jim was mighty good to de Niggers what wukked for him, and us all  loved him. He didn't 'low no patterollers or none of dem Ku Kluxers  neither to bother de Niggers on his place. He said he could look atter  'em his own self. He let 'em have dances, and evvy Fourth of July he had  big barbecues. Yessum, he kilt hogs, goats, sheep and sometimes a cow  for dem barbecues. He believed in havin' plenty to eat.    \"I 'members dem big corn shuckin's. He had de mostes' corn, what was in  great big piles put in a circle. All de neighbors was axed to come and  bring deir Niggers. De fus' thing to do was to 'lect a gen'ral to stand  in de middle of all dem piles of corn and lead de singin' of de reels.  No Ma'am, I don't 'member if he had no shuck stuck up on his hat or not,  and I can't ricollec' what de words of de reels was, 'cause us chillun  was little den, but de gen'ral he pulled off de fus' shuck. Den he  started singin' and den dey all sung in answer to him, and deir two  hands a-shuckin' corn kep' time wid de song. As he sung faster, dey jus'  made dem shucks more dan fly. Evvy time de gen'ral would speed up de  song, de Niggers would speed up deir corn shuckin's. If it got dark  'fore dey finished, us chillun would hold torch lights for 'em to see  how to wuk. De lights was made out of big pine knots what would burn a  long time. Us felt mighty big when us was 'lowed to hold dem torches.  When dey got done shuckin' all de corn, dey had a big supper, and Honey,  dem was sho' some good eatments--barbecue of all sorts--jus' thinkin'  'bout dem pies makes me hongry, even now. Ma made 'em, and she couldn't  be beat on chicken pies and sweet potato pies. Atter dey done et and  drunk all dey wanted, Marse Jim would tell 'em to go to it. Dat was de  word for de gen'ral to start up de dancin', and dat lasted de rest of de  night; dat is if dey didn't all fall out, for old time corn shuckin'  breakdowns was drag-outs and atter all dem 'freshments, hit sho' kept  somebody busy draggin' out dem what fell out. Us chillun was 'lowed to  stay up long as us wanted to at corn shuckin's, and sometimes us would  git out and try to do lak de grown-up Niggers. Hit was de mos' fun.    \"Dey went huntin' and fishin' and when dey cotch or kilt much, dey had a  big supper. I 'members de fus' time I ever cooked 'possum. Ma was sick  in de bed, and de mens had done been 'possum huntin'. Ma said I would  jus' have to cook dem 'possums. She told me how to fix 'em and she said  to fix 'em wid potatoes and plenty of butter and red pepper. Den she  looked at me right hard and said dat dey had better be jus' right. Dat  skeered me so I ain't never been so I could eat no 'possum since den.  Yessum, dey was cooked jus' right, but cookin' 'em jus' once when I was  skeered cured me of de taste for eatin' 'possum.    \"Us chillun didn't git out and go off lak dey does dese days. Us stayed  dar on de plantation. In winter us had to wear plenty of clothes, wid  flannel petticoats and sich lak, and us stayed in by de fire. Big boys  had clothes made out of jeans, but little boys wore homespun shirts. On  hot days us jus' wore one piece of clothes, a sort of shirt what was  made long and had a yoke in it.    \"Dey made me use snuff to cure my sore eyes when I was little, and I  never could quit usin' it no more. When I was 'bout 15, Ma and Pa moved  to Athens and I went to wuk for Mr. Joe Webb's fambly. I wukked for 'em  for 30 years and raised all deir chillun. Dey was all mighty good to me  and seed dat I had plenty of evvything. I would still be dar, but de old  folkses all done died out and gone to dey rest and de younguns done  married and lef' here.    \"I was wukkin' right in de house wid 'em when I 'cided to git married.  Yes Ma'am, I sho' done had one swell elegant weddin'. Jus' evvything  heart could ask for. I married at my Ma's house, but my white folkses  was all right dar, and dey had done fixed de house up pretty wid flowers  all over it. Dey give me my white flannel weddin' dress and it was sho'  pretty, but dey warn't nothin' lackin' 'bout my second day dress. My  white folkses bought dat too,--It was a bottle green silk. Lawsy, but I  was sho' one dressed up bride. It was 8 o'clock dat night when de  preacher got finished wid tyin' dat knot for me and Sam Virgel. My  sister and her fellow stood up wid us and us had a big crowd at our  weddin' supper. Dere was one long table full of our white folkses,  'sides all de Niggers, and I jus' never seed so much to eat. My white  folkses said dat Emma jus' had to have plenty for her weddin' feast and  dey evermore did lay out good things for dat supper, and dem Niggers  sho' did hide dat chicken and cake away lak dey hadn't never seed none  before.    \"I wukked on for de Webbs 'til dey was all gone. De old folks is in  Heb'en whar I 'spects to see 'em some day when de Lord done called me  home. De younguns moved away, but I still loves 'em evvyone, 'cause dey  looked atter old Emma so good when dey was here. Us never had no chillun  and Sam done been gone to his res' long years ago. I'se jus' a-wukkin  and a-waitin 'til I gits called to go too. I don't have plenty all de  time now lak I used to, and nobody here looks atter old Emma no more,  but I makes out.    \"I'se mighty glad it rained if dat's what sont you to my door. It's been  nice to talk wid white folkses again. I wisht I had somepin' nice for  you! Let me cut you a bunch of my flowers?\" She carefully placed her  iron on the hearth and hobbled out in the yard. The May shower had been  followed by sunshine as she handed her guest a huge bouquet of roses,  Aunt Emma bowed low. \"Good-bye, Missy,\" she said, \"please come back to  see me.\"          [HW: Dist. 7  Ex-Slave #110]  Adella S. Dixon    INTERVIEW WITH RHODUS WALTON, EX-SLAVE, Age 84  [Date Stamp: MAY 8 1937]      Ten years before the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, a son was  born to Antony and Patience Walton who lived in Lumpkin, Stewart County,  Ga. When this son, Rhodus, was three weeks old, his mother, along with  the three younger children, was sold. His father and the thirteen sons  and daughters that she left behind were never seen again. His parents'  birthplace and the name they bore before moving to the Walton home are  unknown to Rhodus and he never was able to trace his family even after  \"freedom.\"    The Walton plantation, home of Mr. Sam B. Walton who purchased his  mother, was a very large one with the \"Big House\" on an elevation near  the center. The majestic colonial home with its massive columns was seen  for miles around and from its central location the master was able to  view his entire estate.    Approximately one block from the planter's home, the \"quarters\" were  clustered. These were numerous loghouses with stick-and-clay chimneys in  which the slave families dwelt. Each house was composed of one room  sparsely furnished. The beds were corded with rope and as large families  were stressed, it was often necessary for several members to sleep on  the floor. There was an open fireplace at which family meals were  prepared. Equipment"]]]
