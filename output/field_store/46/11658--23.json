O  Heaven! by whose revolution it seems that men believe conditions  here below are transmuted, when will he come through whom she  shall depart?[1] We were going on with slow and scanty steps, and  I attentive to the shades whom I heard piteously lamenting and  bewailing; and peradventure I heard in front of us one crying  out, \"Sweet Mary,\" in his lament, even as a woman does who is in  travail; and continuing, \"So poor wast thou as may be seen by  that inn where thou didst lay down thy holy burden.\" And  following this I heard, \"O good Fabricius,[2] thou didst rather  wish for virtue with poverty than to possess great riches with  vice.\" These words were so pleasing to me that I drew myself  further on to have acquaintance with that spirit from whom they  seemed to come. He was speaking furthermore of the largess which  Nicholas[3] made to the damsels in order to conduct their youth  to honor. \"O soul that discoursest so well,\" said I, \"tell me who  thou wast, and why thou alone renewest these worthy praises. Not  without meed will be thy words, if I return to complete the short  journey of that life which flies towards its end.\" And he, \"I  will tell thee, not for comfort that I may expect from yonder,[4]  but because such grace shineth on thee ere thou art dead. I was  the root of the evil plant which so overshadows all the Christian  land[5] that good fruit is rarely plucked therefrom. But if  Douai, Lille, Ghent, and Bruges had power, soon would there be  vengeance on it;[6] and I implore it from him who judges  everything. Yonder I was called Hugh Capet: of me are born the  Philips and the Louises, by whom of late times France is ruled. I  was the son of a butcher of Paris.[7] When the ancient kings had  all died out, save one, who had assumed the grey garb,[8] I found  me with the bridle of the government of the realm fast in my  hands, and with so much power recently acquired, and so full of  friends, that to the widowed crown the head of my son was  promoted, from whom the consecrated bones[9] of these began.    [1] The old she-wolf is avarice, the same who at the outset  (Hell, Canto I.) had driven Dante back and made him lose hope of  the height. The likeness of the two passages is striking.    [2] Caius Fabricius, the famous poor and incorruptible Roman  consul, who refused the bribes of Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. Dante  extols his worth also in the Convito, iv. 5.    [3] St. Nicholas, Bishop of Mira, who, according to the legend,  knowing that owing to the poverty of their father, three maidens  were exposed to the risk of leading lives of dishonor, secretly,  at night, threw into the window of their house money enough to  provide each with a dowry.    [4] The earth.    [5] In 1300 the descendants of Hugh Capet were ruling France,  Spain, and Naples.    [6] Phillip the Fair gained possession of Flanders, by force and  fraud, in 1299; but in 1802 the French were driven out of the  country, after a fatal defeat at Courtrai, here dimly prophesied.    [7] Dante here follows the incorrect popular tradition.    [8] Who had become a monk. The historical reference is obscure.    [9] An ironical reference to the ceremony of consecration at the  coronation of the kings.      \"So long as the great dowry of Provence[1] took not the sense of  shame from my race, it was little worth, but still it did not  ill. Then it began its rapine with force and with falsehood; and,  after, for amends,[2] Ponthieu and Normandy it took, and Gascony;  Charles[3] came to Italy, and, for amends, made a victim of  Conradin,[4] and then thrust Thomas[5] back to heaven for amends.  A time I see, not long after this day, that draws forth another  Charles[6] from France to make both himself and his the better  known. Without arms he goes forth thence alone, but with the  lance with which Judas jousted;[7] and that he thrusts so that he  makes the paunch of Florence burst. Therefrom he will gain not  land,[8] but sin and shame so much the heavier for himself, as he  the lighter reckons such harm. The other,[9] who has already gone  out a prisoner from his ship, I see selling his daughter, and  bargaining over her, as do the corsairs with other female slaves.  O Avarice, what more canst thou do with us, since thou hast so  drawn my race unto thyself that it cares not for its own flesh?  In order that the ill to come and that already done may seem the  less, I see the fleur-de-lis entering Anagna, and in his Vicar  Christ made a captive.[10] I see him being mocked a second time;  I see the vinegar and the gall renewed, and between living  thieves him put to death. I see the new Pilate so cruel that this  does not sate him, but, without decretal, he bears his covetous  sails into the Temple.[11] O my Lord, when shall I be glad in  seeing thy vengeance which, concealed, makes sweet thine anger in  thy secrecy?    [1] Through the marriage in 1245 of Charles of Anjou, brother of  St. Louis (Louis IX.), with Beatrice, the heiress of the Count  of Provence.    [2] The bitterness of Dante's irony is explained by the part  which France had played in Italian affairs.    [3] Of Anjou.    [4] The youthful grandson of Frederick II., who, striving to  wrest Naples and Sicily, his hereditary possessions, from the  hands of Charles of Anjou, was defeated and taken prisoner by him  in 1267, and put to deaths by him in 1268. His fate excited great  compassion.    [5] Charles was believed to have had St. Thomas Aquinas poisoned.    [6] Charles of Valois, brother of Philip the Fair, sent by  Boniface VIII., in 1301, to Florence as peacemaker. But there he  wrought great harm, and siding with the Black party, the Whites,  including Dante, were driven into exile.    [7] The lance of treachery.    [8] A reference to his nickname of Senza terra, or Lackland.    [9] Charles II., son of Charles of Anjou. In 1283 he was made  captive in a sea fight, by Ruggieri de Loria, the Admiral of  Peter II. of Aragon. In 1300, according to common report, he sold  his young daughter in marriage to the old Marquis of Este.    [10] Spite of his hostility to Boniface VIII., the worst crime of  the house of France was, in Dante's eyes, the seizure of the Pope  at Anagni, in 1303, by the emissaries of Philip the Fair.    [11] The destruction of the Order of the Temple.      \"What I was saying of that only bride of the Holy Spirit, and  which made thee turn toward me for some gloss, is ordained for  all our prayers so long as the day lasts, but when the night  comes, we take up a contrary sound instead. Then we rehearse  Pygmalion,[1] whom his gluttonous longing for gold made a traitor  and thief and parricide; and the wretchedness of the avaricious  Midas which followed on his greedy demand, at which men must  always laugh. Then of the foolish Achan each one recalls how he  stole the spoils, so that the anger of Joshua seems still to  sting him, here.[2] Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband; we  praise the kicks that Heliodorus received,[3] and in infamy  Polymnestor who slew Polydorus[4] circles the Whole mountain.  Finally our cry here is, 'Crassus, tell us, for thou knowest,  what is the taste of gold?'[5] At times one speaks loud, and  another low, according to the affection which spurs us to speak  now at a greater, now at a less pace. Therefore in the good which  by day is here discoursed of, of late I was not alone, but here  near by no other person lifted up his voice.\"    [1] The brother of Dido, and the murderer of her husband for the  sake of his riches--Aeneid, i. 353-4.    [2] Joshua, vii.    [3] For his attempt to plunder the treasury of the Temple.--2  Maccabees, iii. 25.    [4] Priam had entrusted Polydorus, his youngest son, to  Polymnestor, King of Thrace, who, when the fortunes of Troy  declined, slew Polydorus, that he might take possession of the  treasure sent with him.    [5] Having been slain in battle with the Parthians, their king  poured molten gold down his throat in derision, because of his  fame as the richest of men.      We had already parted from him, and were striving to advance  along the road so far as was permitted to our power, when I felt  the Mountain tremble, like a thing that is falling; whereupon a  chill seized me such as is wont to seize him who goes to death.  Surely Delos shook not so violently, before Latona made her nest  therein to give birth to the two eyes of heaven.[1] Then began on  all sides such a cry that the Master drew towards me, saying:  \"Distrust not, while I guide thee.\" \"Gloria in excelsis Deo,\"[2]  all were saying, according to what I gathered from those near at  hand whose cry it was possible to understand. We stopped,  motionless and in suspense, like the shepherds who first heard  that song, until the trembling ceased, and it was ended. Then we  took up again our holy journey, looking at the shades that were  lying on the ground, returned already to their wonted plaint. No  ignorance ever with so sharp attack made me desirous of  knowing--if my memory err not in this--as it seemed to me I then  experienced in thought. Nor, for our haste, did I dare to ask,  nor of myself could I see aught there. So I went on timid and  thoughtful.    [1] Apollo and Diana, the divinities of Sun and Moon.

The natural thirst,[1] which is never satisfied save with the  water[2] whereof the poor woman of Samaria besought the grace,  was tormenting me, and haste was goading me along the encumbered  way behind my Leader, and I was grieving at the just vengeance;  and lo,--as Luke writes for us that Christ, now risen forth from  the sepulchral cave, appeared to the two who were on the way,--a  shade appeared to us; and it was coming behind us looking at the  crowd that lay at its feet: nor did we perceive it, so it spoke  first saying, \"My Brothers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#18)"],[1,"[1] The Word, that is, the thought or wisdom of God, infinitely  exceeds the expression of it in the creation.    [2] Lucifer fell through pride, fancying himself, though a  created being, equal to his Creator. Had he awaited the full  light of Divine grace, he would have recognized his own  inferiority.    [3] Our vision is not powerful enough to reach the source from  which it proceeds.    [4] It is the gift of God.    [5] There is no light but that which proceeds from God, the light  of Revelation. Lacking this, man is in the darkness of ignorance,  which is in the shadow of the flesh, or of sin, which is its  poison.    [6] The hiding place is the depth of the Divine decrees, which  man cannot penetrate, but the justice of which in his self-  confidence he undertakes to question.    [7] With me, the symbol of justice.    [8] The Scriptures teach you that \"the judgments of God are  unsearchable, and His ways past finding out;\" why, foolish, do ye  disregard them?      \"The primal Will, which of Itself is good, never is moved from  Itself, which is the Supreme Good. So much is just as is  accordant to It; no created good draws It to itself, but It,  raying forth, is the cause of that good.\"      As above her nest the stork circles, after she has fed her brood,  and as he who has been fed looks up at her, such became (and I so  raised my brows) the blessed image, which moved its wings urged  by so many counsels. Wheeling it sang, and said, \"As are my  notes to thee who understandest them not, so is the eternal  judgment to you mortals.\"    After those shining flames of the Holy Spirit became quiet, still  in the sign which made the Romans reverend to the world, it began  again, \"To this kingdom no one ever ascended, who had not  believed in Christ either before or after he was nailed to the  tree. But behold, many cry Christ, Christ, who, at the Judgment,  shall be far less near to him, than such an one who knew not  Christ; and the Ethiop will condemn such Christians when the two  companies shall be divided, the one forever rich, and the other  poor. What will the Persians be able to say to your kings, when  they shall see that volume open in which are written all their  dispraises?[1] There among the deeds of Albert shall be seen  that which will soon set the pen in motion, by which the kingdom  of Prague shall be made desert.[2] There shall be seen the woe  which he who shall die by the blow of a wild boar is bringing  upon the Seine by falsifying the coin.[3] There shall be seen the  pride that quickens thirst, which makes the Scot and the  Englishman mad, so that neither can keep within his  own bounds.[4] The luxury shall be seen, and the effeminate  living of him of Spain, and of him of Bohemia, who never knew  valor, nor wished it.[5] The goodness of the Cripple of Jerusalem  shall be seen marked with a I, while an M shall mark the  contrary.[6] The avarice and the cowardice shall be seen of  him[7] who guards the island of the fire, where Anchises ended  his long life; and, to give to understand how little worth he is,  the writing for him shall be in contracted letters which shall  note much in small space. And to every one shall be apparent the  foul deeds of his uncle and of his brother[8] who have dishonored  so famous a nation and two crowns. And he of Portugal,[9] and he  of Norway[10] shall be known there; and he of Rascia,[11] who, to  his harm, has seen the coin of Venice. O happy Hungary, if she  allow herself no longer to be maltreated! and happy Navarre, if  she would arm herself with the mountains which bind her  round![12] And every one must believe that now, for earnest of  this, Nicosia and Famagosta are lamenting and complaining because  of their beast which departs not from the flank of the  others.[13]    [1] The Persians, who know not Christ, will rebuke the sins of  kings professedly Christians, when the book of life shall be  opened at the last Judgment.    [2] The devastation of Bohemia in 1303, by Albert of Austria (the  \"German Albert\" of the sixth canto of Purgatory), will soon set  in motion the pen of the recording angel.    [3] After his terrible defeat at Courtray in 1302, Philip the  Fair, to provide himself with means, debased. the coin of the  realm. He died in 1314 from the effects of a fall from his horse,  oven thrown by a wild boar in the forest of Fontainebleau.    [4] The wars of Edward I. and Edward II. with the Scotch under  Wallace and Bruce were carried on with little intermission during  the first twenty years of the fourteenth century.    [5] By \"him of Spain,\" Ferdinand IV. of Castile (1295-1312)  seems to be intended; and by \"him of Bohemia,\" Wenceslaus IV.,  \"whom luxury and idleness feed.\" (Purgatory, Canto VII.).    [6] The virtues of the lame Charles II. of Apulia, titular king  of Jerusalem, shall be marked with one, but his vices with a  thousand.    [7] Frederick of Aragon, King of Sicily, too worthless to have  his deeds written out in full. Dante's scorn of Frederick was  enhanced by his desertion of the Ghibellines after the death of  Henry VII.    [8] James, King of Majorca and Minorca, and James, King of  Aragon.

[11] Rascia, so called from a Slavonic tribe, which occupied a  region south of the Danube, embracing a part of the modern Servia  and Bosnia. The kingdom was established in 1170. One of its  kings, Stephen Ouros, who died in 1307, imitated the coin of  Venice with a debased coinage.    [12] If she would make the Pyrenees her defence against France,  into the hands of whose kings Navarre fell in 1304.    [13] The lot of these cities in Cyprus, which are now lamenting  under the rule of Henry II. of the Lusignani, a beast who goes  along with the rest, is a pledge in advance of what sort of fate  falls to those who do not defend themselves.        CANTO XX. The Song of the Just.--Princes who have loved  righteousness, in the eye of the Eagle.--Spirits, once Pagans, in  bliss.--Faith and Salvation.--Predestination.    When he who illumines all the world, descends from our hemisphere  so that the day on every side is spent, the heavens which erst by  him alone are enkindled, suddenly become again conspicuous with  many lights, on which one is shining.[1] And this act of the  heavens came to my mind when the ensign of the world and of its  leaders became silent in its blessed beak; because all those  living lights, far more shining, began songs which lapse and fall  from out my memory.    [1] One, that is, the sun, supposed to be the source of the  light of the stars.      O sweet love, that cloakest thee with a smile, how ardent didst  thou appear in those pipes[1] which had the breath alone of holy  thoughts!    [1] That is, in those singers.      After the precious and lucent stones, wherewith I saw the sixth  luminary ingemmed, imposed silence on their angelic bells, I  seemed to hear the murmur of a stream which falls pellucid down  from rock to rock, showing the abundance of its mountain source.  And as the sound takes its form at the cithern's neck, and in  like manner at the vent of the bagpipe the air which enters it,  thus, without pause of waiting, that murmur of the Eagle rose up  through its neck, as if it were hollow. There it became voice,  and thence it issued through its beak in form of words, such as  the heart whereon I wrote them was awaiting.    \"The part in me which in mortal eagles sees and endures the sun,\"  it began to me, \"must now be fixedly looked upon, because of the  fires whereof I make my shape, those wherewith the eye in my head  sparkles are the highest of all their grades. He who shineth in  the middle, as the pupil, was the, singer of the Holy Spirit,  who, bore about the ark from town to town.[1] Now he knows the  merit of his song, so far as it was the effect of his own  counsel,[2] by the recompense which is equal to it. Of the five  which make a circle for the brow, be who is nearest to my beak  consoled the poor widow for her son.[3] Now he knows, by the  experience of this sweet life and of the opposite, how dear it  costs not to follow Christ. And he who follows along the top of  the are in the circumference of which I speak, by true penitence  postponed death.[4] Now he knows that the eternal judgment is not  altered, when worthy prayer there below makes to-morrow's what is  of to-day. The next who follows,[5] under a good intention which  bore bad fruit, by ceding to the Pastor[6] made himself Greek,  together with the laws and me. Now he knows how the ill derived  from his good action is not hurtful to him, although thereby the  world may be destroyed. And he whom thou seest in the down-bent  are was William,[7] whom that land deplores which weeps for  Charles and Frederick living.[8] Now he knows how heaven is  enamoured of a just king, and even by the aspect of his  effulgence makes it seen. Who, down in the erring world, would  believe that Rhipeus the Trojan[9] was the fifth in this circle  of the holy lights? Now he knows much of what the world cannot  see of the divine grace, although his sight cannot discern its  depth.\"    [1] David. See 2 Samuel, vi.
