Those that wrote the first were called _quick-writers_,  those that wrote the second were called _book-writers_. If an author was  not skilled in the use of the pen, he employed a _quickwriter_ to write  down his words as he delivered them. But in order that his work might be  published it was handed over to the _book-writers_ to be copied out more  neatly; and numbers of young women, skilled in penmanship, were employed  in the trade of copying books for sale. For this purpose parchment  was coming into use, though the old papyrus was still used, as an  inexpensive though less lasting writing material.    Athenaeus, if we may judge from Iris writings, was then the brightest of  the Alexandrian wits and men of learning. We learn from his own pages  that he was born at Naucratis, and was the friend of Pancrates, who  lived under Hadrian, and also of Oppian, who died in the reign of  Caracalla. His _Deipnosophist_, or table-talk of the philosophers, is a  large work full of pleasing anecdotes and curious information, gathered  from comic writers and authors without number that have long since been  lost. But it is put together with very little skill. His industry and  memory are more remarkable than his judgment or good taste; and the  table-talk is too often turned towards eating and drinking. His amusing  work is a picture of society in Alexandria, where everything frivolous  was treated as grave, and everything serious was laughed at. The wit  sinks into scandal, the humour is at the cost of morality, and the  numerous quotations are chosen for their point, not for any lofty  thoughts or noble feeling. Alexandria was then as much the seat of  literary wit as it was of dry criticism; and Martial, the lively author  of the _Epigrams_, had fifty years before remarked that there were few  places in the world where he would more wish his verses to be repeated  than on the banks of the Nile.    Nothing could be lower than the poetic taste in Alexandria at this time.  The museum was giving birth to a race of poets who, instead of bringing  forth thoughts out of their own minds, found them in the storehouse of  the memory only. They wrote their patchwork poems by the help of Homer's  lines, which they picked from all parts of the Iliad and Odyssey and  so put together as to make them tell a new tale. They called themselves  Homeric poets.    Lucian, the author of the _Dialogues_, was at that time secretary to the  prefect of Egypt, and this philosopher found a broad mark for his  humour in the religion of the Egyptians, their worship of animals and  water-jars, their love of magic, the general mourning through the land  on the death of the bull Apis, their funeral ceremonies, their placing  of their mummies round the dinner-table as so many guests, and pawning a  father or a brother when in want of money.    [Illustration: 122.jpg A SNAKE-CHARMER]    So little had the customs changed that the young Egyptians of high birth  still wore their long hair tied in one lock, and hanging over the right  ear, as we see on the Theban sculptures fifteen centuries earlier. It  was then a mark of royalty, but had since been adopted by many families  of high rank, and continues to be used even in the twentieth century.    [Illustration: 123.jpg THE SIGN OF NOBILITY]    Before the end of this reign we meet with a strong proof of the spread  of Christianity in Egypt. The number of believers made it necessary for  the Bishop of Alexandria to appoint three bishops under him, to look  after the churches in three other cities; and accordingly Demetrius, who  then held that office, took upon himself the rank, if not the name, of  Patriarch of Alexandria. A second proof of the spread of Christianity  is the pagan philosophers thinking it necessary to write against it.  Celsus, an Epicurean of Alexandria, was one of the first to attack it.  Origen answered the several arguments of Celsus with skill and candour.  He challenges his readers to a comparison between the Christians and  pagans in point of morals, in Alexandria or in any other city. He  argues in the most forcible way that Christianity had overcome all  difficulties, and had spread itself far and wide against the power of  kings and emperors, and he says that nobody but a Christian ever died  a martyr to the truth of his religion. He makes good use of the Jewish  prophecies; but he brings forward no proofs in support of the truth of  the gospel history; they were not wanted, as Celsus and the pagans had  not considered it necessary to call it into question.    Another proof of the number of Egyptian Christians is seen in the  literary frauds of which their writers were guilty, most likely to  satisfy the minds of those pagan converts that they had already made  rather than from a wish to make new believers. About this time was  written by an unknown Christian author a poem in eight books, named the  _Sibylline Verses_ which must not be mistaken for the pagan fragments  of the same name. It is written in the form of a prophecy, in the style  used by the Gnostics, and is full of dark sentences and half-expressed  hints.    Another spurious Christian work of about the same time is the  _Clementina_, or the _Recognitions of Clemens_, Bishop of Rome. It is  an account of the travels of the Apostle Peter and his conversation with  Simon Magus; but the author's knowledge of the Egyptian mythology, of  the opinions of the Greek philosophers, and of the astrological rules by  which fortunes are foretold from the planets' places, amply prove that  he was an Egyptian or an Alexandrian. No name ranked higher among the  Christians than that of Clemens Romanus; and this is only one out of  several cases of Christian authors who wished to give weight to their  own opinions by passing them upon the world as his writings.    Marcus Aurelius, who died in 181 A.D., had pardoned the children of the  rebel general Avidius Cassius, but Commodus began his reign by putting  them to death; and, while thus disregarding the example and advice of  his father, he paid his memory the idle compliment of continuing his  series of dates on his own coins. But the Egyptian coinage of Commodus  clearly betrays the sad change that was gradually taking place in the  arts of the country; we no longer see the former beauty and variety of  subjects; and the silver, which had before been very much mixed with  copper, was under Commodus hardly to be known from brass.    [Illustration: 125.jpg CARTOUCHE OF COMMODUS]    Commodus was very partial to the Egyptian superstitions, and he adopted  the tonsure, and had his head shaven like a priest of Isis, that he  might more properly carry an Anubis staff in sacred processions, which  continued to be a feature of the religious activities of the age. Upper  Egypt had latterly been falling off in population. It had been drained  of all its hoarded wealth. Its carrying trade through Koptos to the Red  Sea was much lessened. Any tribute that its temples received from the  piety of the neighbourhood was small. Nubia was a desert; and a few  soldiers at Syene were enough to guard the poverty of the Thebaid  from the inroads of the Blemmyes. It was no longer necessary to  send criminals to the Oasis; it was enough to banish them to the  neighbourhood of Thebes. Hence we learn but little of the state of  the country. Now and then a traveller, after measuring the pyramids of  Memphis and the underground tombs of Thebes, might venture as far as the  cataracts, and watch the sun at noon on the longest day shining to the  bottom of the sacred well at Syene, like the orator Aristides and his  friend Dion. But such travellers were few; the majority of those who  made this journey have left the fact on record.    The celebrated museum, which had held the vast library of the Ptolemies,  had been burnt by the soldiers of Julius Caesar in one of their battles  with the Egyptian army in the streets of Alexandria; but the loss had  been in part repaired by Mark Antony's gift of the library from Pergamus  to the temple of Serapis. The new library, however, would seem to have  been placed in a building somewhat separated from the temple, as when  the temple of Serapis was burnt in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, and  again when it was in part destroyed by fire in the second year of this  reign we hear of no loss of books; and two hundred years later the  library of the Serapium, it is said, had risen to the number of seven  hundred thousand volumes. The temple-keeper to the great god Serapis, or  one of the temple-keepers, at this time was Asclepiades, a noted boxer  and wrestler, who had been made chief of the wrestling-ground and had  received the high rank of the emperor's freedman. He set up a statue to  his father Demetrius, an equally noted boxer and wrestler, who had been  chief priest of the wrestling-ground and of the emperor's baths in the  last reign.    [Illustration: 126.jpg THE ANUBIS STAFF]    Another favourite in the theatre was Apolaustus of Memphis, who removed  to Rome, where he was crowned as conqueror in the games, and as a reward  made priest to Apollo and emperor's freedman.    The city of Canopus was still a large mart for merchandise, as the  shallow but safe entrance to its harbour made it a favourite with pilots  of the small trading vessels, who rather dreaded the rocks at the mouth  of the harbour of Alexandria. A temple of Serapis which had lately been  built at Canopus was dedicated to the god in the name of the Emperor  Commodus; and there some of the grosser superstitions of the polytheists  fled before the spread of Christianity and platonism in Alexandria. The  Canopic jars, which held those parts of the body that could not be made  solid in the mummy, and which had the heads of the four lesser gods  of the dead on their lids, received"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#18)"],[1,"ities, and wait. To  this the grand vizier and Kleber consented, but on conditions that were  irreconcilable. The grand vizier insisted that Cairo should be given up  to him; Kleber, on the contrary, that the vizier should fall back to the  frontier. Under these conditions, fighting was the only resource.    On the 20th of March, 1800, in the plain of Heliopolis, ten thousand  soldiers, by superiority in discipline and courage, dispersed seventy  or eighty thousand foes. Kleber gave orders for the pursuit on the  following day. When he had ascertained with his own eyes that the  Turkish army had disappeared, he resolved to return and reduce the towns  of Lower Egypt, and Cairo in particular, to their duty.    He arrived at Cairo on the 27th of March. Important events had occurred  there since his departure. The population of that great city, which  numbered nearly three hundred thousand inhabitants, fickle, inflammable,  inclined to change, had followed the suggestions of Turkish emissaries,  and fallen upon the French the moment they heard the cannon at  Heliopolis. Pouring forth outside the walls during the battle, and  seeing Nassif-Pasha and Ibrahim Bey, with some thousand horse and  janizaries, they supposed them to be the conquerors. Taking good care  not to undeceive the inhabitants, the Turks affirmed that the grand  vizier had gained a complete victory, and that the French were  exterminated. At these tidings, fifty thousand men had risen in Cairo,  at Bulak, and at Gizeh, and Cairo became a scene of plunder, rapine, and  murder.    [Illustration: 137.jpg CITADEL OF CAIRO]    During these transactions, General Friant arrived, detached from  Belbeys, and lastly Kleber himself. Though conqueror of the grand  vizier's army, Kleber had a serious difficulty to surmount to subdue an  immense city, peopled by three hundred thousand inhabitants, partly in  a state of revolt, occupied by twenty thousand Turks, and built in the  Oriental style; that is to say, having narrow streets, divided into  piles of masonry, which were real fortresses. These edifices, receiving  light from within, and exhibiting without nothing but lofty walls, had  terraces instead of roofs, from which the insurgents poured a downward  and destructive fire. Add to this that the Turks were masters of the  whole city, excepting the citadel and the square of Ezbekieh, which,  in a manner, they had blockaded by closing the streets that ran into it  with embattled walls.    In this situation, Kleber showed as much prudence as he had just  shown energy in the field. He resolved to gain time, and to let the  insurrection wear itself out. The insurgents could not fail at length  to be undeceived respecting the general state of things in Egypt, and to  learn that the French were everywhere victorious, and the vizier's army  dispersed. Nassif-Pasha's Turks, Ibrahim Bey's Mamluks, and the Arab  population of Cairo could not agree together long. For all these  reasons, Kleber thought it advisable to temporise and to negotiate.    While he was gaining time, he completed his treaty of alliance with  Murad Bey. He granted to him the province of Sai'd, under the supremacy  of France, on condition of paying a tribute equivalent to a considerable  part of the imposts of that province. Murad Bey engaged, moreover, to  fight for the French; and the French engaged, if they should ever quit  the country, to facilitate for him the occupation of Egypt. Murad Bey  faithfully adhered to the treaty which he had just signed, and began  by driving from Upper Egypt a Turkish corps which had occupied it. The  insurgents of Cairo obstinately refused to capitulate, and an attack by  main force was, therefore, indispensable for completing the reduction of  the city, during which several thousand Turks, Mamluks, and insurgents  were killed, and four thousand houses were destroyed by fire. Thus  terminated that sanguinary struggle, which had commenced with the battle  of Heliopolis on the 20th of March, and which ended on the 25th of  April with the departure of the last lieutenants of the vizier, after  thirty-five days' fighting between twenty thousand French on one side,  and, on the other, the whole force of the Ottoman empire, seconded by  the revolt of the Egyptian towns.    In the Delta all the towns had returned to a state of complete  submission. Murad Bey had driven from Upper Egypt the Turkish detachment  of Dervish Pasha. The vanquished everywhere trembled before the  conqueror, and expected a terrible chastisement. Kleber, who was humane  and wise, took good care not to repay cruelties with cruelties. The  Egyptians were persuaded that they should be treated harshly; they  conceived that the loss of life and property would atone for the crime  of those who had risen in revolt. Kleber called them together, assumed  at first a stern look, but afterwards pardoned them, merely imposing a  contribution on the insurgent villages. Cairo paid ten million francs,  a burden far from onerous for so large a city, and the inhabitants  considered themselves as most fortunate to get off so easily. Eight  millions more were imposed upon the rebel towns of Lower Egypt. The  army, proud of its victories, confident in its strength, knowing that  General Bonaparte was at the head of the government, ceased to doubt  that it would soon receive reinforcements. Kleber had in the plain of  Heliopolis made the noblest amends for his momentary faults.    He entered upon a second conquest, showing clemency and humanity on  all sides, and everywhere he laboured hard to encourage the arts and  industries and agriculture. He assembled the administrators of the army,  the persons best acquainted with the country, and turned his attention  to the organisation of the finances of the colony. He restored the  collection of the direct contributions to the Kopts, to whom it had  formerly been entrusted, and imposed some new customs' duties and taxes  on articles of consumption. He gave orders for the completion of the  forts constructing around Cairo, and set men to work at those of Lesbeh,  Damietta, Burlos, and Rosetta, situated on the sea-coast. He pressed  forward the works of Alexandria, and imparted fresh activity to the  scientific researches of the Institute of Egypt, and a valuable mass of  information was embodied in the great French work, the \"Description  de l'Egypte.\" From the cataracts to the mouths of the Nile, everything  assumed the aspect of a solid and durable establishment. Two months  afterwards, the caravans of Syria, Arabia, and Darfur began to appear  again at Cairo.    But a deplorable event snatched away General Kleber in the midst of his  exploits and of his judicious government. He was assassinated in the  garden of his palace by a young man, a native of Aleppo, named Suleiman,  who was a prey to extravagant fanaticism.    With Kleber's death, Egypt was lost for France. Menou, who succeeded  him, was very far beneath such a task. The English offered to make good  the convention of El Arish, but Menou refused, and England prepared for  an invasion, after attempting vainly to co-operate with the Turks.    Sir Ralph Abercrombie, who had been appointed as British commissioner,  landed with the English army alone at Abukir. After fierce skirmishing,  the French and English met on the plains of Alexandria. In the frightful  conflict which ensued, Sir Ralph Abercrombie was slain, but the battle  ended with the retreat of the French. Damietta surrendered on April  19th. The French were now divided, while Menou hesitated. General  Hutchinson took the place of the deceased British commander. A great  battle was fought at Cairo, which was won by the British, and the  capital itself now fell into their hands. General Hutchinson then  closed in upon Alexandria; and, after hard fighting, Menou at length  surrendered. The French troops were allowed to return to France with all  their belongings, except the artillery, August 27, 1801.          CHAPTER III.--THE RULE OF MEHEMET ALI      _Mehemet's rise to power: Massacre of the Mamluks: Invasion of the  Morea: Battle of Navarino: Struggle with the Porte: Abbas Pasha,  Muhammed Said, and Ismail Pasha: Ismail's lavish expenditure: Foreign  bondholders and the Dual Control._      From the beginning of the eighteenth century, the destiny of Egypt  was the destiny of one man; he aided the political movements, and  accelerated or retarded social activity; he swayed both commerce and  agriculture, and organised the army to his liking; he was the heart and  brain of this mysterious country. Under the watchful eyes of Europe,  attentive for more than forty years, this Macedonian soldier became the  personification of the nation under his authority, and, in the main, the  history of the country may be summed up in the biography of Mehemet Ali.  If we consider the events of his life, and the diverse roads by which  he reached the apogee of his fortunes, reviewing the scenes, now sombre,  now magnificent, of that remarkable fate, we obtain a complete picture  of Egypt itself, seen from the most intimate, real, and striking point  of view.    According to the most authentic accounts, Mehemet Ali was born in 1768  (a. h. 1182), at Cavala, a seaport in Turkey in Europe. He was yet  very young when he lost his father, Ibrahim Agha, and soon after this  misfortune, his uncle and sole remaining relative, Tussun-Agha, was  beheaded by order of the Porte. Left an orphan, Mehemet Ali was adopted  by the Tchorbadji of Praousta, an old friend of his father, who brought  him up with his own son. The boy spent his early youth in the discharge  of unimportant military duties, where, however, he frequently found  opportunity to display his intelligence and courage. He was even able to  render many services to his protector in the collecting of taxes, which  was always a difficult matter in Turkey, and occasionally necessitated a  regular military expedition.
