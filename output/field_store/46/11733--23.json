(1) As to the treatment of the      floor: no shield has been admitted into the floor but such as      represent persons in close relation to the King's College, of a date      antecedent to the Scottish Reformation of 1560. When the series is      completed, they will be found to represent:--          _Royal Shields_        1. James IV., the Royal Founder.    Motto, _Leo Magnanimus_.      2.

(West side) _In te Domine speravi: non confundar_ (In Thee, O      Lord, have I trusted: let me never be confounded).        The roof has a continuous system of decoration in colour and floral      ornament, except in the four compartments at the extreme east end      over the apse, where structural necessities imposed a variation. The      central space of the roof is filled with scrolls containing the      words, Laus, Potestas, Honor, Gloria, in ecclesiastical letter,      varied by insertions of the monogram of the Saviour, I.H.S., at      intervals recurring. \"Below these, and towards the junction of the      roof with walls, appears what may be called a flying scroll of      inscriptions, being a series of Latin texts and chants, chiefly from      the Vulgate, capable of being read continuously, round the roof, and      interrupted only by the apse, which, as explained, has a separate      treatment.\" \"In the apse, which, like Scottish apses of that period,      is not semicircular, but has three facets, being semi-hexagonal, the      frieze inscriptions are the University motto in its two clauses,      with Sursum Corda in the centre. These occupy severally the three      divisions into which the apse frieze falls, while in the      compartments above are the symbolical figures in gold usually      associated with the four Evangelists, viz. the Angel of S. Matthew,      the Lion of S. Mark, the Ox of S. Luke, and the Eagle of S. John.      The flying scroll attached to these figures is the text in      Revelation (iv. 8). The band at the springing of the arched roof is      variegated by a series of shields or disks, in which the sacred      monogram alternates with the emblems of the Passion. The order in      which the emblems have been placed is as follows:          _West End_        South side ends.           North side begins.      15. Moon.                     1. Sun.      14. Ladder.                   2. Bag of Judas.      13. Spear and Sponge.         3. Lantern.      12. Dice.                     4. Cock.      11. Seamless Coat.            5. Scourges.      10. Hammer and Pincers.       6. Pillar and Cords.      9. Three Nails.               7. Crown of Thorns.      8. Cross, I.N.R.I.          _East or Apse End_        \"The figures of the sun or moon, which are usually represented in      the Crucifixion scene, on either side of, and close to, the cross,      have here by a certain liberty been made to commence and close the      series.\" ... \"Fortunately the fretwork, when reversed, was found,      though fragile, to be fairly sound; and, although not all entirely      on a uniform pattern, a large section of it, when turned upward,      presented the appearance of a series of Pots of Lilies, side by      side, a discovery which largely reconciled one to the alteration,      inasmuch as this emblem of the Virgin is known to have been not only      familiar to, but also a favourite with, the Founder of the College.      The King's College, besides, was originally the College of S. Mary.\"          _Chancel and Apse_        The Professorial stalls have for the cresting the emblems of the      Seven Virtues, viz. the four cardinal virtues of the Philosophers,      and the three celestial virtues, or Graces of the Theologians. The      sequence is:--        {1. Justice, symbolised by the Scales and Balance.      {2. Courage      \"      \"      Thistle.      {3. Temperance   \"      \"      Bridle.      {4. Prudence     \"      \"      Compasses (Mariner's and Carpenter's).        {5. Faith        \"      \"      Pillar with Wreath of Victory.      {6. Hope         \"      \"      Anchor.      {7. Love         \"      \"      Flaming Heart.        They are repeated in such order on both sides, and the four Cardinal      Virtues are towards the west or exterior; the three Theological      Virtues toward the east or interior of the apse. On the stall      forming the eighth on the south side, there is the monogram of the      Alpha and Omega. On the panels of the stalls, \"the leading idea      sought to be maintained was the representation in sequence of the      various emblems of Christ and the Christian life, as drawn from the      cornu copiae of Nature, in the fruits and flowers of the vegetable      world, that unfallen portion of creation which the Divine Teacher      honoured by drawing from it, and from it alone, His similes and      parables. They are severally as follows, commencing from the west:--        1. The Lily.}      2. The Palm.}      3. The Rose.}      4. The Trefoil.        5. The Vine and Grapes.}      6. The Olive.          }      7. The Wheat-ears.\"    }        At the eighth panel on the south side, under the [Greek: Alpha] and      [Greek: Omega] of the cresting, stands the Pot of Lilies as a symbol      of the Virgin.    We have given an account of the late learned Principal's paper as  appropriate to this history. It shows how art can both express the  spirit of the place and become a servant of religion. It illustrates  Professor Flint's declaration:--\"God as the perfectly good is not only  Absolute Truth and Absolute Holiness, but also Absolute Beauty. He is  the source, the author, the giver of all beautiful things and qualities.  All the beauties of earth and sea and sky, of life and mind and spirit,  are rays from His beauty. The powers by which they are perceived are  conferred by Him. The light in which they are seen is His light.\"[239]    _Roslin (Mid-Lothian)._--The church was founded in 1450 by Sir William  St. Clair, Baron of Roslin and third Earl of Orkney. It was dedicated to  St. Matthew, and founded for a provost, six prebendaries, and two  choristers. In the quaint language of Father Hay:--        \"His adge creeping on him, to the end that he might not seem      altogither unthankfull to God for the benefices he receaved from      Him, it came in his mind to build a house for God's service, of      most curious worke: the which that it might be done with greater      glory and splendor, he caused artificers to be brought from other      regions and forraigne kingdomes, and caused dayly to be abundance of      all kinde of workmen present: as masons, carpenters, smiths,      barrowmen, and quarriers, with others. The foundation of this rare      worke he caused to be laid in the year of our Lord 1446: and to the      end the worke might be the more rare: first he caused the draughts      to be drawn upon Eastland boords, and made the carpenters to carve      them according to the draughts thereon, and then gave them for      patterns to the masons that they might thereby cut the like in      stone.\"    He was probably himself the source of the design, and his enlightened  liberality attracted to the place the best workmen in Scotland, as well  as from parts of the Continent. It has been said by the most recent  authorities:--        \"The church, so far as erected, is in perfect preservation, and is a      charming portion of an incomplete design. It is, in some respects,      the most remarkable piece of architecture in Scotland; and had the      church been finished in the same spirit as that in which it has been      so far carried out, it would have gone far to have realised a poet's      dream in stone. When looked at from a strictly architectural point      of view, the design may be considered faulty in many respects, much      of the detail being extremely rude and debased, while as regards      construction many of the principles wrought out during the      development of Gothic architecture are ignored. But notwithstanding      these faults, the profusion of design so abundantly shown      everywhere, and the exuberant fancy of the architect, strike the      visitor who sees Rosslyn for the first time with an astonishment      which no familiarity ever effaces.\"[240]    The original intention was to complete the building as a cross church,  with choir, nave, and transepts, but the choir only has been completed.  The transepts have been partly erected, the east wall being carried up  to a considerable height, but the nave has not been erected. The church  consists of a choir, with north and south aisles, connected by an aisle  which runs across the east end, giving access to a series of four  chapels beyond it to the east.

Does not all the city know that Madame Langley has over  and over again refused the most costly bribes offered to induce her to  use her influence with her husband? and is it not also well-known that  if her influence is to be gained at all, it must be by touching her  heart?  She is so open, too, in her conduct, that her domestics know all  she does.  Did I not tell you, the other night, how the chief from  Marocco offered her a splendid diamond ring to induce her to intreat her  husband's favour in something--I know not what,--and how she flushed  with indignation as she refused it, and told the chief that all the  diamonds in the world could not move her to attempt the leading of her  husband from the path of duty?  No, I will not ask her to become a spy,  but I will lead her, in conversation, to tell me all she knows, or at  least is willing to communicate, about Sidi Hassan; and perchance some  good may come of it.\"    \"It may be so,\" said the Dey; \"and where and when dost thou propose to  meet with her?\"    \"Here, and to-morrow.\"    \"How! in the palace?\"    \"Yes.  Ask her and her little girl to come and dine with me,\" said  Ashweesha.    \"That would be a high compliment,\" returned the Dey dubiously; \"such as  has never been paid before, methinks, by a Dey of Algiers to any  consul's wife.\"    \"No matter,\" returned the Sultana; \"you have a high regard for Colonel  Langley, and have often paid him unusual compliments,--why not  compliment his wife?\"    \"Well, it shall be done.  To-morrow afternoon prepare to receive her.\"        CHAPTER TWELVE.    MRS. LANGLEY AND AGNES GO OUT TO DINNER.    An agreeable surprise is something like sunshine in November; it warms  up the constitution, mentally and physically.    Such a surprise did Mrs Langley receive the morning that followed the  evening on which Achmet Dey and his Sultana held their private  conversation on the affairs of state.  \"Agnes!\" she exclaimed, reading a  note with elevated eyebrows, \"just fancy! here is an invitation for you  and me to dine with the Dey's wife or wives!\"    \"Oh! _won't_ that be delightful?\" cried Agnes, coming from the court  into the room where her mother sat, with such a bound, that she filled  with sympathetic excitement the heart of the small negro girl from  beyond the Zahara, and caused her to rock the cradle too violently.    \"There, you've bumped it again; I knew you would!\" said Mrs Langley, in  tones of despair.    Poor Zubby's first awful glance of mingled deprecation and self-reproach  was so touching that no one but a hardened monster could have withstood  it; but the look, with the feelings which it implied, was short-lived.  It passed like a summer cloud, and was replaced by an expression of  supreme contentment and self-satisfaction when it became apparent that  Master Jim was _not_ going to awake, and that Mrs Langley's despair was  vanishing.  Indeed, that lady's despair was at all times remarkably  short-lived.  She had been trained in a school of dire adversity ever  since the arrival of the coal-black one from beyond the Zahara, and had  learned to hope against hope in an extraordinary degree in a case which  was absolutely hopeless, for, whatever others might think or hope, Zubby  knew herself to be incurable!  Not that she was unwilling; on the  contrary, there never was a more obliging or amiable creature among the  sable daughters of Ham, but she had a tendency to forget herself, (as  well as her charge), in moments of sudden emotion or delight, and gave  way to burstlets of action, which, if slight, were always inopportune,  and sometimes, though not often, disastrous.    \"We must get ready immediately,\" continued Mrs Langley, with a  cautioning shake of the head at Zubby, as she turned to Agnes; \"because,  you know, we may as well take the opportunity to do a little shopping  before dinner.\"    \"What! `shopping' in the pirate city?\" we hear you exclaim, reader.    Yes, there _was_ shopping there in those days, though it did not bear  much resemblance to shopping in more civilised lands.  There were no  wide fronts or plate-glass windows in those days.  Indeed, then, as now,  a shop in the Moorish town might be fitly described as a hole in the  wall.  It was, as it were, a deep window without an interior to speak  of.  A square hole, six feet by six, and from four to ten feet deep,  without glazing or protection of any kind from the weather, except, in  some cases, an awning, was a fair average shop; one of eight feet  frontage was rather a \"grand shop,\" and one of twelve feet was quite a  \"bazaar.\"    Of course such shops were stuffed, like eggs, to an excess of fulness.  They gave one the impression that the goods had been packed into smaller  space than was possible, and that the introduction of another pin would  infallibly explode the whole affair.  A passage among the goods in each  shop, just big enough to admit an ordinary man, was the scene of action  in which the owner disported.  This passage did not begin at the street:  so much valuable space could not be afforded.  A counter laden with  small wares had to be leapt in order to gain it, and a rope depending  from the ceiling rendered possible the acrobatic feat which was  necessary to do so.  Purchasers had to stand in the streets and transact  business, the said streets being so narrow that there was no room for  lobbies or paved foot-paths.  While engaged in traffic, buyers were  compelled more or less to block the way, and had their garments scraped  successively by Turks and Moors and veiled Mohammedan females, by  Cabyles from the mountains, negroes from Timbuctoo, white slaves from  almost every country in Europe, and donkeys of the most debased and  abject type,--these latter, by the way, being quite as capable as the  human--though not humane--beings who drove them of going up and down  stairs.  No slope short of a perpendicular dead wall appeared to be able  to stop them, and no wonder, poor wretches! for no torture short of  total destruction was spared them.    Ah! ye members of the \"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\"  in Algiers, forgive us if we interject here the observation that there  is earnest need for your activities at the present day!    Followed by the faithful though uncontrollable Zubby, with a huge  triangular grass basket, Mrs Langley entered the tortuous streets of  the city, and proceeded to \"shop.\"    Fear not, reader!  It is not our purpose to drag you through the details  of the too well-known process.  We pass onward to matters more  important.    Having traversed several streets in which Moors sat cross-legged,  embroidering purses and slippers with gold, in holes in the wall so  small that a good-sized bust might have objected to occupy them; where  cobblers, in similar niches, made and repaired round-toed shoes of  morocco leather, and the makers of horn rings for fingers, wrists, arms  and ankles wrought as deftly with their toes as with their fingers;  where working silversmiths plied their trade in precious metals and gems  in a free-and-easy open-air fashion that would have made the mouth of a  London thief water; and where idle Arabs sipped coffee and smoked the  live-long day, as though coffee and tobacco were the aim and end of  life--which latter they proved indeed to many of them,--Mrs Langley  with Agnes, followed by Zubby, paused before a niche in which were  displayed for sale a variety of curious old trinkets of a nondescript  and utterly useless character.  In short, it appeared to be an Algerine  curiosity-shop.  Here, while bargaining with the owner for some small  articles, she was surprised to hear a voice at her ear say in French--    \"Madame, good morning; I have great pleasure in this unexpected  meeting.\"    She turned hastily, and found the Danish consul standing by her side.    \"Ah, monsieur,\" she said, returning his salutation, \"it is indeed seldom  that I wander alone through this labyrinth, but necessity compels me.  An English friend wishes me to send her a few characteristic articles,  and I can trust no one to choose them for me.  But, you look anxious.\"    \"Yes, excuse me,\" replied the Danish consul in haste, glancing round.  \"I am followed, persecuted I may say.  I had intended to call for your  husband to-day to beg him to use his influence with the Dey in my  behalf, but I cannot--circumstances--in short, will you kindly mention  to him that I am in trouble because of the non-payment of the tribute  due by our Government, and--\"    Breaking off suddenly, the Danish consul bowed low and hurried away.  Mrs Langley observed that, immediately after, a chaouse, or executioner  of the palace, passed her.    This incident induced her to conclude her shopping rather quickly, and  furnished her with food for thought which entirely engrossed her mind  until Agnes exclaimed--    \"Oh mamma, look! look! they're going to shave a little boy!\"    Mrs Langley, directed by Agnes's finger, looked and found that this was  indeed true.  A little boy, between eight and nine years of age, was  seated in a barber's shop near them, with a towel about his neck,  glancing timidly, yet confidently, in the face of an elderly man who  advanced towards him with an open razor, as though about to cut his  throat.  As it turned out, however, neither throat nor chin were in  danger of violation.  It was"]]]
