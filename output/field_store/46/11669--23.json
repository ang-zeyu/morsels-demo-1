Next, let these  lines be divided in such a way as to leave four and a half parts under  the abacus; then, at the point which forms the division between the four  and a half parts and the remaining three and a half, fix the centre of  the eye, and from that centre describe a circle with a diameter equal to  one of the eight parts. This will be the size of the eye, and in it draw  a diameter on the line of the \"cathetus.\" Then, in describing the  quadrants, let the size of each be successively less, by half the  diameter of the eye, than that which begins under the abacus, and  proceed from the eye until that same quadrant under the abacus is  reached.    7. The height of the capital is to be such that, of the nine and a half  parts, three parts are below the level of the astragal at the top of the  shaft, and the rest, omitting the abacus and the channel, belongs to  its echinus. The projection of the echinus beyond the fillet of the  abacus should be equal to the size of the eye. The projection of the  bands of the cushions should be thus obtained: place one leg of a pair  of compasses in the centre of the capital and open out the other to the  edge of the echinus; bring this leg round and it will touch the outer  edge of the bands. The axes of the volutes should not be thicker than  the size of the eye, and the volutes themselves should be channelled out  to a depth which is one twelfth of their height. These will be the  symmetrical proportions for capitals of columns twenty-five feet high  and less. For higher columns the other proportions will be the same, but  the length and breadth of the abacus will be the thickness of the lower  diameter of a column plus one ninth part thereof; thus, just as the  higher the column the less the diminution, so the projection of its  capital is proportionately increased and its breadth[2] is  correspondingly enlarged.    [Note 2: Codd. _altitudo_.]    8. With regard to the method of describing volutes, at the end of the  book a figure will be subjoined and a calculation showing how they may  be described so that their spirals may be true to the compass.    The capitals having been finished and set up in due proportion to the  columns (not exactly level on the columns, however, but with the same  measured adjustment, so that in the upper members there may be an  increase corresponding to that which was made in the stylobates), the  rule for the architraves is to be as follows. If the columns are at  least twelve feet and not more than fifteen feet high, let the height of  the architrave be equal to half the thickness of a column at the bottom.  If they are from fifteen feet to twenty, let the height of a column be  measured off into thirteen parts, and let one of these be the height of  the architrave. If they are from twenty to twenty-five feet, let this  height be divided into twelve and one half parts, and let one of them  form the height of the architrave. If they are from twenty-five feet to  thirty, let it be divided into twelve parts, and let one of them form  the height. If they are higher, the heights of the architraves are to be  worked out proportionately in the same manner from the height of the  columns.    9. For the higher that the eye has to climb, the less easily can it make  its way through the thicker and thicker mass of air. So it fails when  the height is great, its strength is sucked out of it, and it conveys to  the mind only a confused estimate of the dimensions. Hence there must  always be a corresponding increase in the symmetrical proportions of the  members, so that whether the buildings are on unusually lofty sites or  are themselves somewhat colossal, the size of the parts may seem in due  proportion. The depth of the architrave on its under side just above the  capital, is to be equivalent to the thickness of the top of the column  just under the capital, and on its uppermost side equivalent to the foot  of the shaft.    10. The cymatium of the architrave should be one seventh of the height  of the whole architrave, and its projection the same. Omitting the  cymatium, the rest of the architrave is to be divided into twelve parts,  and three of these will form the lowest fascia, four, the next, and  five, the highest fascia. The frieze, above the architrave, is one  fourth less high than the architrave, but if there are to be reliefs  upon it, it is one fourth higher than the architrave, so that the  sculptures may be more imposing. Its cymatium is one seventh of the  whole height of the frieze, and the projection of the cymatium is the  same as its height.    11. Over the frieze comes the line of dentils, made of the same height  as the middle fascia of the architrave and with a projection equal to  their height. The intersection (or in Greek [Greek: metope]) is  apportioned so that the face of each dentil is half as wide as its  height and the cavity of each intersection two thirds of this face in  width. The cymatium here is one sixth of the whole height of this part.  The corona with its cymatium, but not including the sima, has the height  of the middle fascia of the architrave, and the total projection of the  corona and dentils should be equal to the height from the frieze to the  cymatium at the top of the corona.    [Illustration: A COMPARISON OF THE IONIC ORDER ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS  WITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES AND WITH VIGNOLA'S ORDER    A: Showing the orders reduced to equal lower diameters. B: Showing the  orders to a uniform scale.]    And as a general rule, all projecting parts have greater beauty when  their projection is equal to their height.    12. The height of the tympanum, which is in the pediment, is to be  obtained thus: let the front of the corona, from the two ends of its  cymatium, be measured off into nine parts, and let one of these parts be  set up in the middle at the peak of the tympanum, taking care that it is  perpendicular to the entablature and the neckings of the columns. The  coronae over the tympanum are to be made of equal size with the coronae  under it, not including the simae. Above the coronae are the simae (in  Greek [Greek: epaietides]), which should be made one eighth higher than  the height of the coronae. The acroteria at the corners have the height  of the centre of the tympanum, and those in the middle are one eighth  part higher than those at the corners.    13. All the members which are to be above the capitals of the columns,  that is, architraves, friezes, coronae, tympana, gables, and acroteria,  should be inclined to the front a twelfth part of their own height, for  the reason that when we stand in front of them, if two lines are drawn  from the eye, one reaching to the bottom of the building and the other  to the top, that which reaches to the top will be the longer. Hence, as  the line of sight to the upper part is the longer, it makes that part  look as if it were leaning back. But when the members are inclined to  the front, as described above, they will seem to the beholder to be  plumb and perpendicular.    14. Each column should have twenty-four flutes, channelled out in such a  way that if a carpenter's square be placed in the hollow of a flute and  turned, the arm will touch the corners of the fillets on the right and  left, and the tip of the square may keep touching some point in the  concave surface as it moves through it. The breadth of the flutes is to  be equivalent to the enlargement in the middle of a column, which will  be found in the figure.    15. In the simae which are over the coronae on the sides of the temple,  lion's heads are to be carved and arranged at intervals thus: First one  head is marked out directly over the axis of each column, and then the  others are arranged at equal distances apart, and so that there shall be  one at the middle of every roof-tiling. Those that are over the columns  should have holes bored through them to the gutter which receives the  rainwater from the tiles, but those between them should be solid. Thus  the mass of water that falls by way of the tiles into the gutter will  not be thrown down along the intercolumniations nor drench people who  are passing through them, while the lion's heads that are over the  columns will appear to be vomiting as they discharge streams of water  from their mouths.    In this book I have written as clearly as I could on the arrangements of  Ionic temples. In the next I shall explain the proportions of Doric and  Corinthian temples.          BOOK IV          INTRODUCTION      1. I have observed, Emperor, that many in their treatises and volumes of  commentaries on architecture have not presented the subject with  well-ordered completeness, but have merely made a beginning and left, as  it were, only desultory fragments. I have therefore thought that it  would be a worthy and very useful thing to reduce the whole of this  great art to a complete and orderly form of presentation, and then in  different books to lay down and explain the required characteristics of  different departments. Hence, Caesar, in my first book I have set forth  to you the function of the architect and the things in which he ought to  be trained. In the second I have discussed the supplies of material of  which buildings are constructed. In the third, which deals with the  arrangements of temples and their variety of form, I showed the nature  and number of their classes, with the adjustments proper to each form  according to the usage of the Ionic order, one of the three which  exhibit the greatest delicacy of proportion in their symmetrical  measurements. In the present book I shall speak of the established rules  for the Doric and Corinthian orders, and shall explain their differences  and peculiarities.          CHAPTER I    THE ORIGINS OF THE THREE ORDERS, AND THE PROPORTIONS OF THE CORINTHIAN  CAPITAL      1. Corinthian columns are, excepting in their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#18)"],[1," shield the innocent from pain and  poverty. He finds that his clergy cannot point to one clear trace of the  action of God in human affairs. In the whole long record of man's career  the finger of God cannot be found pointing to one well-substantiated  fact.    The Martian considers the theistic argument that it would be impossible  to have an orderly universe merely resulting from the inherent  properties of natural forces, and that \"directivity\" is necessary to  keep the universe on its present track. Keeping in mind the scientific  conception of the universe and the knowledge at hand concerning the  atoms and their properties, it is inconceivable that any other  arrangement than the present one should have resulted. The Martian  cannot marvel as most earthlings do that the present order exists as it  does; the marvel to him would be if any other order should be or that  any radical alteration in it should occur. He perceives that the state  of the universe at any moment is the result of all the conditions then  prevailing, and that the natural forces possess the capacity to produce  the universe as we see it. It matters not what the ultimate nature of  these forces may be, electrons, protons, electricity, or wave energy;  these material forces possess the capacity to produce the universe as we  see it. If these forces do not possess this capacity it is indeed  difficult for the Martian to conceive in what way even a \"directing and  supreme mathematician\" an \"ultimate,\" or any supernatural power however  designated could produce this capacity. Unless the capacity for  producing the universe as we see it existed in the atoms themselves, no  amount of direction could have produced it. The property of the atom and  its combinations to produce the material universe is therefore inherent  in the atoms themselves and does not necessitate the operation of a  deity. The order manifest in the universe is the necessary consequence  of the persistence of force. If a supernatural, intelligent force  existed, the Martian believes that the claims of the theist could in no  way be better substantiated than if this controlling force would in some  way manifest an inhibitive influence and prevent certain things  occurring which would have transpired but for his interference. Such  manifestations have not occurred. It is impossible for the theist to  show any instance in which the normal consequences of known forces did  not transpire in which the aberration could not be accounted for by the  operation of other known forces.    A \"law\" of nature is not a statute drawn up by a legislator; it is the  interpretation and the summation which we give to the observed facts.  The phenomena which we observe do not act in a particular manner because  there is a law; but we state the \"law\" because they act in that  particular manner. It cannot be said that the laws of nature are the  result of a lawmaker; it cannot be affirmed that a supreme intelligence  told things in nature to act just that way and no other. If the theist  claims that a supreme intelligence issued laws for his own pleasure and  without any reason, then he must admit that there is something which is  not subject to law and the train of natural law is interrupted. If it is  claimed that a supreme intelligence had a reason for the laws which he  gave, the reason being to create the best possible universe, then it  follows that God himself was subject to law and there is no advantage in  introducing God as an intermediary. This contention would make it appear  that there is a law outside and anterior to the divine edicts, and God  does not serve the purpose of the theist since he is not the ultimate  lawgiver.    The anthropomorphic conception of God, our Martian finds, is now denied  by most cultured theists; nevertheless, they still maintain a belief in  a deity endowed with consciousness. Professor H. N. Wieman states that,  \"God is superhuman, but not supernatural. He is a present, potent,  operative, observable reality.... He is more worthy of love than any  other beloved ... He is one to whom men can pray and do pray, and who  answers prayer.\" This can be understood to be not greatly removed from  the fundamentalists' conception of God, but when he continues to say,  \"God is that interaction between individuals, groups, and ages which  generates and promotes the greatest possible mutuality of good,\" and \"it  responds to prayer and is precisely what answers prayer, when prayer is  answered,\" the personal \"He\" has suddenly changed to the unpersonal  \"It.\" Emotions and intelligence are connected with nerve structures in  all sentient beings that we have experience and knowledge of. How can we  attribute these qualities to a being who is described to us as devoid of  any nerve structure?    In former ages the theist saw God in the color and construction of a  flower, in the starry heavens, and in a sunset or sunrise. The  biologists have driven the theists from this misconception, the  physicists have explained the phenomena of sunset and sunrise, and with  the advance of astronomy the heavens no longer proclaim the glory of  God, and the theistic arguments have shifted from worlds to atoms. At  the present moment the vision of God has narrowed down to a perception  of the divine intelligence noted in the design of the atom. Astronomy,  physics, geology, chemistry, medicine, psychology, ethics, aesthetics,  and the social sciences have left no room for a theistic explanation of  the universe. The mystics who proclaim God in their intuitive trances  are being crowded out into the light of reason by the researches of  psychologists. There are still many gaps in our knowledge, and if the  theist persists in finding the manifestation of a supreme being in these  vague zones of our present ignorance, he is at the mercy of the science  of the future. Science is concerned with mind as much as it is with the  material aspects of atoms and stars, hence the sciences of psychology,  ethics, and aesthetics. The entire universe is the province of science  and it is rapidly providing a scientific interpretation of all the  contents of the universe. It may well be a few more centuries before the  scientific explanation is partially complete, but it must be kept in  mind that science as we conceive the term is less than 2500 years old,  and out of this infantile period, at least 1000 years must be deducted  for the intellectual stagnation of the dark ages.    In tracing the retreat of the clergy from the arguments from the First  Cause, the arguments from design, causation, and directivity, the  Martian recalls the words of Vivian Phelips, \"How is it that God allowed  earnest and learned divines to commit themselves to arguments in proof  of His existence, the subsequent overthrow of which has been a potent  cause for unbelief?\"    \"The finite mind cannot expect to understand the Infinite,\" retorts a  theist to our Martian. \"What manner of reasoning is this,\" asks our  Martian, \"that denies my finite mind the right to question the 'proofs'  of the existence of an Infinite, when these same 'proofs' are derived by  finite minds? The theist cannot infer God from the cosmic process until  he can discover some feature of it which is unintelligible without him.\"    (2) The belief in a deity, but the rejection of revelations, theology,  priestcraft, and church.    To the Martian the opinion held by these individuals presented two  difficulties. First, if the adherents of this hypothesis considered  their deity as a providence which took an active part in the life of  this world, then the objections heretofore stated against belief in a  personal god are still valid. Secondly, if they considered this being as  only a creator, who then leaves this world to its own resources, they  are only assuming a philosophical existence behind phenomena. Such a  being, they believe, they deduce intellectually. But actually who  created this creator? They assume a god who remains always hidden behind  phenomena, but such a god has no connection with the God that the  religious man worships and to whom he prays for guidance and for  blessings, for actual interference in the life of this world. Such  theories impress our visitor as but a feeble attempt at new concepts of  the same hypothetical deity, and it seemed to him that we already had  sufficient ideas of God to trouble our earthly minds.    (3) The god of the Physicists.    It was brought to the Martian's attention that two scientists, Sir  Arthur Eddington, a British astronomer, and Sir James Jeans, a  mathematical physicist, had still another concept of God.    According to Eddington, \"Phenomena all boil down to a scheme of symbols,  of mathematical equations.\" He admits that this mathematics of nature  does not explain anything. They do not define reality, they only define  the relations that exist between the phenomena of reality. So far does  he go, and then his limited mind, our Martian perceives, meets an  obstacle that he cannot explain. He, therefore, abandons the formula and  returns to the human mind which has conceived this formula. From the  \"spiritual essence of Man's nature,\" he assumes the spiritual nature of  the cosmos itself, which he finds in what religion has known for  centuries as God. To him, it is impossible to explain the universe  except in terms of spirit.    Professor Jeans insists that in the equations which reveal the relations  between phenomena, there may reside also the revelation of the ultimate  which these phenomena express. He believes that there may exist \"a great  architect of the universe who is a pure mathematician.\"    However, the Martian argues, \"Is it not a fact that in your earthly  experience, you have created your gods in your own image? Your savages  created God in the only fashion their mental capacities could supply, in  the shape of an idol; now the modern physicist creates his god in the  light"]]]
