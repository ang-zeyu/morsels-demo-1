He sold it in 1942 for his middle  price.\"    There was another flash by the door, then Kavaalen called out:    \"Hey, Mick; we got two of the stiffs, now. All right if we pull out the  bayonet for a close-up of his chest?\"    \"Sure. Better chalkline it, first; you'll move things jerking that  bayonet out.\" He turned back to Rand. \"You think, then, that maybe some  card in that file would have gotten somebody in trouble, and he had to  croak Rivers to get it, and then burned the rest of the cards for a  cover-up?\"    \"That's the way it looks to me,\" Rand agreed. \"Just because I can't think  of any other possibility, though, doesn't mean that there aren't any  others.\"    \"Hey! You think he might have been selling modern arms to criminals,  without reporting the sale?\" McKenna asked.    \"I wouldn't put it past him,\" Rand considered. \"There was very little  that I would put past that fellow. But I wouldn't think he'd be stupid  enough to carry a record of such sales in his own file, though.\"    McKenna rubbed the butt of his .38 reflectively; that seemed to be his  substitute for head-scratching, as an aid to cerebration.    \"You said you were here yesterday, and bought a pistol,\" he began. \"All  right; I know about that collection of yours. But why were you back here  bright and early this morning? You working on Rivers for somebody? If so,  give.\"    Rand told him what he was working on. \"Rivers wants to buy the Fleming  collection. That was the reason I saw him yesterday. But the reason I  came here, this morning, is that I find that somebody has stolen about  two dozen of the best pistols out of the collection since Fleming's  death, and tried to cover up by replacing them with some junk that Lane  Fleming wouldn't have allowed inside his house. For my money, it's the  butler. Now that Fleming's dead, he's the only one in the house who knows  enough about arms to know what was worth stealing. He has constant access  to the gunroom. I caught him in a lie about a book Fleming kept a record  of his collection in, and now the book has vanished. And furthermore, and  most important, if he'd been on the level, he would have spotted what was  going on, long ago, and squawked about it.\"    \"That's a damn good circumstantial case, Jeff,\" McKenna nodded. \"Nothing  you could take to a jury, of course, but mighty good grounds for  suspicion.... You think Rivers could have been the fence?\"    \"He could have been. Whoever was higrading the collection had to have an  outlet for his stuff, and he had to have a source of supply for the junk  he was infiltrating into the collection as replacements. A crooked dealer  is the answer to both, and Arnold Rivers was definitely crooked.\"    \"You know that?\" McKenna inquired. \"For sure?\"    Another flash lit the front of the shop. Rand nodded.    \"For damn good and sure. I can show you half a dozen firearms in this  shop that have been altered to increase their value. I don't mean  legitimate restorations; I mean fraudulent alterations.\" He went on to  tell McKenna about Rivers's expulsion from membership in the National  Rifle Association. \"And I know that he sold a pair of pistols to Lane  Fleming, about a week before Fleming was killed, that were outright  fakes. Fleming was going to sue the ears off Rivers about that; the fact  is, until this morning, I'd been wondering if that mightn't have been  why Fleming had that sour-looking accident. If he'd lived, he'd have run  Rivers out of business.\"    \"Hell, I didn't know that!\" McKenna seemed worried. \"Fleming used to  target-shoot with our gang, and he knew too much about gats to pull a  Russ Columbo on himself. I didn't like that accident, at the time, but I  figured he'd pulled the Dutch, and the family were making out it was an  accident. We never were called in; the whole thing was handled through  the coroner's office. You really think Fleming could have been bumped?\"    \"Yes. I think he could have been bumped,\" Rand understated. \"I haven't  found any positive proof, but--\" He told McKenna about his purchase, from  Rivers, of the revolver that had been later identified as the one brought  home by Fleming on the day of his death. \"I still don't know how Rivers  got hold of it,\" he continued. \"Until I walked in here not half an hour  ago and found Rivers dead on the floor, I'd had a suspicion that Rivers  might have sneaked into the Fleming house, shot Fleming with another  revolver, left it in Fleming's hand and carried away the one Fleming had  been working on. The motive, of course, would have been to stop a lawsuit  that would have put Rivers out of business and, not inconceivably, in  jail. But now ...\" He looked toward the front of the shop, where another  photo-flash glared for an instant. \"And don't suggest that Rivers got  conscience-stricken and killed himself. Aside from the technical  difficulties of pinning himself to the floor after he was dead, that  explanation's out. Rivers had no conscience to be stricken with.\"    \"Well, let's skip Fleming, for a minute,\" McKenna suggested. \"You think  this butler, at the Fleming place, was robbing the collection. And you  say he could've sold the stuff he stole to Rivers. Well, when the family  gets you in to work on the collection, Jeeves, or whatever his name is,  realizes that you're going to spot what's been going on, and will  probably suspect him. He knows you're no ordinary arms-expert; you're an  agency dick. So he gets scared. If you catch up with Rivers, Rivers'll  talk. So he comes over here, last night, and kills Rivers off before you  can get to him. And while Rivers may not keep a record of the stuff he  got from Jeeves, or whatever his name is--\"    \"Walters,\" Rand supplied.    \"Walters, then. While he may not keep a record of what he bought from  Walters, the chances are he does keep a record of the stuff Walters got  from him, to use for replacements, so the card-file goes into the fire.  How's that?\"    The flare of another flash-bulb made distorted shadows dance over the  walls.    \"That would hang together, now,\" Rand agreed. \"Of course, I haven't found  anything here, except the revolver I bought yesterday, that came from the  Fleming place, but I'll add this: As soon as Rivers found out I was  working for the Fleming family, he tried to get that revolver back from  me. Offered me seventy-five dollars' worth of credit on anything else in  the shop if I'd give it back to him, not twenty minutes after I'd paid  him sixty for it.\"    \"See!\" McKenna pounced. \"Look; suppose you had a lot of hot stuff, in a  place like this. You might take a chance on selling something that had  gotten mixed in with your legitimate stuff, but would you want to sell  it right back to where it had been stolen from?\"    \"No, I wouldn't. And if I were a butler who'd been robbing a valuable  collection, and an agency man moved in and started poking around, I might  get in a panic and do something extreme. That all hangs together, too.\"    While Rand was talking to McKenna, Private Jameson wandered back through  the shop.    \"Hey, Sarge, is there any way into the house from here?\" he asked. \"The  outside doors are all locked, and I can't raise anybody.\"    Rand pointed out the flight of steps beside the fireplace. \"I saw Rivers  come out of the house that way, yesterday,\" he said.    The State Policeman went up the steps and tried the door; it opened, and  he went through.    \"Chances are Mrs. Rivers is away,\" McKenna said. \"She's away a lot. They  have a colored girl who comes in by the day, but she doesn't generally  get here before noon. And the clerk doesn't get here till about the same  time.\"    \"You seem to know a lot about this household,\" Rand said.    \"Yeah. We have this place marked up as a bad burglary- and stick-up  hazard; we keep an eye on it. Rivers has all these guns, he does a big  cash business, he always has a couple of hundred to a thousand on  him--it's a wonder somebody hasn't made a try at this place long  ago.... Tell you what, Jeff; say you check up on this butler at the  Fleming place for us, and we'll check up here and see if we can find any  of the stuff that was stolen. We can get together and compare notes.  Maybe one or another of us may run across something about that accident  of Fleming's, too.\"    \"Suits me. I'll be glad to help you, and I'll be glad for any help you  can give me on recovering those pistols. I haven't made any formal report  on that, yet, because I'm not sure exactly what's missing, and I don't  want any of that kind of publicity while I'm trying to sell the  collection. It may be that the two matters are related; there are some  points of similarity, which may or may not mean anything. And, of course,  I just may find somebody who'll make it worth my time to get interested  in this killing, while I'm at it.\"    McKenna chuckled. \"That must hurt hell out of you, Jeff,\" he said. \"A  nice classy murder like this, and nobody to pay you to work on it.\"    \"It does,\" Rand admitted. \"I feel like an undertaker watching a man being  swallowed by a shark.\"    \"You want to stick around till this clerk of Rivers's gets here?\" McKenna  asked. \"He should be here in about an hour and a half.\"    \"No. I'd just as soon not be seen taking too much of an interest in this  right now. Fact is, I'd just as soon not have my name mentioned at all in  connection with this. You can charge the discovery of the body up to our  old friend, Anonymous Tip, can't you?\"    \"Sure.\" McKenna accompanied Rand to the front door, past the white  chalked outline that marked the original position of the body. The body  itself, with ink-blackened fingertips, lay to one side, out of the way.  Corporal Kavaalen was going through the dead man's pockets, and Skinner  was working on the rifle with an insufflator.    \"Well, we can't say it was robbery, anyhow,\" Kavaalen said. \"He had eight  C's in his billfold.\"    \"Migawd, Sarge, is this damn rifle ever lousy with prints,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#18)"],[1," called merits. Wherefore also  according to the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 9), happiness is the reward  of works of virtue.    Reply Obj. 1: Works are necessary to man in order to gain Happiness;  not on account of the insufficiency of the Divine power which bestows  Happiness, but that the order in things be observed.    Reply Obj. 2: God produced the first creatures so that they are  perfect forthwith, without any previous disposition or operation of  the creature; because He instituted the first individuals of the  various species, that through them nature might be propagated to  their progeny. In like manner, because Happiness was to be bestowed  on others through Christ, who is God and Man, \"Who,\" according to  Heb. 2:10, \"had brought many children into glory\"; therefore, from  the very beginning of His conception, His soul was happy, without any  previous meritorious operation. But this is peculiar to Him: for  Christ's merit avails baptized children for the gaining of Happiness,  though they have no merits of their own; because by Baptism they are  made members of Christ.    Reply Obj. 3: The Apostle is speaking of the Happiness of Hope, which  is bestowed on us by sanctifying grace, which is not given on account  of previous works. For grace is not a term of movement, as Happiness  is; rather is it the principle of the movement that tends towards  Happiness.  ________________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 8]    Whether Every Man Desires Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that not all desire Happiness. For no man  can desire what he knows not; since the apprehended good is the object  of the appetite (De Anima iii, 10). But many know not what Happiness  is. This is evident from the fact that, as Augustine says (De Trin.  xiii, 4), \"some thought that Happiness consists in pleasures of the  body; some, in a virtue of the soul; some in other things.\" Therefore  not all desire Happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, the essence of Happiness is the vision of the Divine  Essence, as stated above (Q. 3, A. 8). But some consider it  impossible for man to see the Divine Essence; wherefore they desire  it not. Therefore all men do not desire Happiness.    Obj. 3: Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 5) that \"happy is he  who has all he desires, and desires nothing amiss.\" But all do not  desire this; for some desire certain things amiss, and yet they wish  to desire such things. Therefore all do not desire Happiness.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 3): \"If that actor  had said: 'You all wish to be happy; you do not wish to be unhappy,'  he would have said that which none would have failed to acknowledge  in his will.\" Therefore everyone desires to be happy.    _I answer that,_ Happiness can be considered in two ways. First  according to the general notion of happiness: and thus, of necessity,  every man desires happiness. For the general notion of happiness  consists in the perfect good, as stated above (AA. 3, 4). But since  good is the object of the will, the perfect good of a man is that  which entirely satisfies his will. Consequently to desire happiness  is nothing else than to desire that one's will be satisfied. And this  everyone desires. Secondly we may speak of Happiness according to its  specific notion, as to that in which it consists. And thus all do not  know Happiness; because they know not in what thing the general  notion of happiness is found. And consequently, in this respect, not  all desire it. Wherefore the reply to the first Objection is clear.    Reply Obj. 2: Since the will follows the apprehension of the  intellect or reason; just as it happens that where there is no real  distinction, there may be a distinction according to the  consideration of reason; so does it happen that one and the same  thing is desired in one way, and not desired in another. So that  happiness may be considered as the final and perfect good, which is  the general notion of happiness: and thus the will naturally and of  necessity tends thereto, as stated above. Again it can be considered  under other special aspects, either on the part of the operation  itself, or on the part of the operating power, or on the part of the  object; and thus the will does not tend thereto of necessity.    Reply Obj. 3: This definition of Happiness given by some--\"Happy is  the man that has all he desires,\" or, \"whose every wish is  fulfilled,\" is a good and adequate definition, if it be understood in  a certain way; but an inadequate definition if understood in another.  For if we understand it simply of all that man desires by his natural  appetite, thus it is true that he who has all that he desires, is  happy: since nothing satisfies man's natural desire, except the  perfect good which is Happiness. But if we understand it of those  things that man desires according to the apprehension of the reason,  thus it does not belong to Happiness, to have certain things that man  desires; rather does it belong to unhappiness, in so far as the  possession of such things hinders man from having all that he desires  naturally; thus it is that reason sometimes accepts as true things  that are a hindrance to the knowledge of truth. And it was through  taking this into consideration that Augustine added so as to include  perfect Happiness--that he \"desires nothing amiss\": although the  first part suffices if rightly understood, to wit, that \"happy is he  who has all he desires.\"  ________________________    TREATISE ON HUMAN ACTS: ACTS PECULIAR TO MAN (QQ. 6-21)  ________________________    QUESTION 6    OF THE VOLUNTARY AND THE INVOLUNTARY  (In Eight Articles)    Since therefore Happiness is to be gained by means of certain acts,  we must in due sequence consider human acts, in order to know by what  acts we may obtain Happiness, and by what acts we are prevented from  obtaining it. But because operations and acts are concerned with  things singular, consequently all practical knowledge is incomplete  unless it take account of things in detail. The study of Morals,  therefore, since it treats of human acts, should consider first the  general principles; and secondly matters of detail.    In treating of the general principles, the points that offer  themselves for our consideration are (1) human acts themselves; (2)  their principles. Now of human acts some are proper to man; others  are common to man and animals. And since Happiness is man's proper  good, those acts which are proper to man have a closer connection  with Happiness than have those which are common to man and the other  animals. First, then, we must consider those acts which are proper to  man; secondly, those acts which are common to man and the other  animals, and are called Passions. The first of these points offers a  twofold consideration: (1) What makes a human act? (2) What  distinguishes human acts?    And since those acts are properly called human which are voluntary,  because the will is the rational appetite, which is proper to man; we  must consider acts in so far as they are voluntary.    First, then, we must consider the voluntary and involuntary in  general; secondly, those acts which are voluntary, as being elicited  by the will, and as issuing from the will immediately; thirdly, those  acts which are voluntary, as being commanded by the will, which issue  from the will through the medium of the other powers.    And because voluntary acts have certain circumstances, according to  which we form our judgment concerning them, we must first consider  the voluntary and the involuntary, and afterwards, the circumstances  of those acts which are found to be voluntary or involuntary. Under  the first head there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether there is anything voluntary in human acts?    (2) Whether in irrational animals?    (3) Whether there can be voluntariness without any action?    (4) Whether violence can be done to the will?    (5) Whether violence causes involuntariness?    (6) Whether fear causes involuntariness?    (7) Whether concupiscence causes involuntariness?    (8) Whether ignorance causes involuntariness?  ________________________    FIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 6, Art. 1]    Whether There Is Anything Voluntary in Human Acts?    Objection 1: It would seem that there is nothing voluntary in human  acts. For that is voluntary \"which has its principle within itself.\"  as Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Natura Hom. xxxii.], Damascene (De  Fide Orth. ii, 24), and Aristotle (Ethic. iii, 1) declare. But the  principle of human acts is not in man himself, but outside him: since  man's appetite is moved to act, by the appetible object which is  outside him, and is as a \"mover unmoved\" (De Anima iii, 10).  Therefore there is nothing voluntary in human acts.    Obj. 2: Further, the Philosopher (Phys. viii, 2) proves that in  animals no new movement arises that is not preceded by a motion from  without. But all human acts are new, since none is eternal.  Consequently, the principle of all human acts is from without: and  therefore there is nothing voluntary in them.    Obj. 3: Further, he that acts voluntarily, can act of himself. But  this is not true of man; for it is written (John 15:5): \"Without Me  you can do nothing.\" Therefore there is nothing voluntary in human  acts.    _On the contrary,_ Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii) that \"the  voluntary is an act consisting in a rational operation.\" Now such are  human acts. Therefore there is something voluntary in human acts.    _I answer that,_ There must needs be something voluntary in human  acts. In order to make this clear, we must take note that the  principle of some acts or movements is within the agent, or that  which is moved; whereas the principle of some movements or acts is  outside. For when a stone is moved upwards, the principle of this  movement is outside the stone: whereas when it is moved downwards,  the principle of this movement is in the stone. Now of"]]]
