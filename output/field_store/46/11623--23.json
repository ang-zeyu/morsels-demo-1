It has never occurred before. It proves that a  momentous event is about to take place, and I am certain that this event  can be nothing less than the Advent of the promised Qa'im.'\"    Such was the situation of that illustrious prince when he passed away,  leaving as heirs a son and two daughters. Thinking him to be as wealthy as  ever, the people believed that his heirs would inherit millions, for  everyone knew his way of life. The Persian diplomatic representative, the  latter-day mujtahids, and the faithless judge all sharpened their teeth.  They started a quarrel among the heirs, so that in the resulting turmoil  they themselves would make substantial gains. With this in view they did  whatever they could to ruin the heirs, the idea being to strip the  inheritors bare, while the Persian diplomat, the mujtahids, and the judge  would accumulate the spoils.    Mirza Musa was a staunch believer; his sisters, however, were from a  different mother, and they knew nothing of the Cause. One day the two  sisters, accompanied by the son-in-law of the late Mirza Siyyid Rida, came  to the house of Baha'u'llah. The two sisters entered the family apartments  while the son-in-law settled down in the public reception rooms. The two  girls then said to Baha'u'llah: \"The Persian envoy, the judge, and the  faithless mujtahids have destroyed us. Toward the close of his life, the  late Haji trusted no one but Yourself. We ourselves have been remiss and  we should have sought Your protection before; in any case we come now to  implore Your pardon and help. Our hope is that You will not send us away  despairing, and that through Your favor and support we shall be saved.  Deign, then, to look into this affair, and to overlook our past mistakes.\"    Replying, the Blessed Beauty declared with finality that intervention in  affairs of this kind was abhorrent to Him. They kept on pleading with Him,  however. They remained a whole week in the family apartments, clamoring  every morning and evening for favor and grace. \"We will not lift our heads  from off this Threshold,\" they said. \"We will seek sanctuary here in this  house; we will remain here, by the door of Him Who guards the angels,  until He shall deign to look into our concerns and to save us from our  oppressors.\"    Each day, Baha'u'llah would counsel them, saying, \"Matters of this kind  are in the hands of the mujtahids and the government authorities. We do  not interfere in such affairs.\" But they kept on with their importunities,  insisting, imploring, begging for help. It happened that the house of  Baha'u'llah was bare of worldly goods, and these ladies, accustomed to the  best of everything, could hardly be satisfied with bread and water. Food  had to be procured for them on credit. Briefly, from every direction,  there were problems.    Finally one day Baha'u'llah summoned me to His presence. \"These esteemed  ladies,\" He said, \"with all their exactions, have put Us to considerable  inconvenience. There is no help for it--you will have to see to this case.  But you must solve this entire, complicated matter in a single day.\"    The next morning, accompanied by Aqay-i-Kalim, I went to the house of the  late Haji. We called in appraisers and they collected all the jewels in an  upper apartment; the ledgers and account books having to do with the  properties were placed in a second room; the costly furnishings and art  objects of the house in a third. A number of jewelers then went to work  and set a value on the gems. Other experts appraised the house, the shops,  the gardens, the baths. As soon as they began their work I came out and  posted someone in each room so that the appraisers could duly complete  their tasks. By this time it was nearly noon. We then had luncheon, after  which the appraisers were directed to divide everything into two equal  parts, so that lots could be cast; one part would be that of the  daughters, and one that of the son, Mirza Musa.(67) I then went to bed,  for I was ill. In the afternoon I rose, had tea, and repaired to the  family apartments of the mansion. Here I observed that the goods had been  divided into three parts. I said to them: \"My instructions were that  everything should be divided into two parts. How is it that there are  three?\" The heirs and other relatives answered as one: \"A third must  certainly be set aside. That is why we have divided everything into three.  One share is for Mirza Musa, one for the two daughters, and the third we  place at Your disposal; this third is the portion of the deceased and You  are to expend it in any way You see fit.\"    Greatly disturbed, we told them, \"Such a thing is out of the question.  This you must not require, for it cannot be complied with. We gave our  word to Baha'u'llah that not so much as a copper coin would be accepted.\"  But they, too, swore upon oath that it must be as they wished, that they  would agree to nothing else. This servant answered: \"Let us leave this  matter for the present. Is there any further disagreement among you?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mirza Musa, \"what has become of the money that was left?\"  Asked the amount, he answered: \"Three hundred thousand tumans.\" The  daughters said: \"There are two possibilities: either this money is here in  the house, in some coffer, or buried hereabouts--or else it is in other  hands. We will give over the house and all its contents to Mirza Musa. We  two will leave the house, with nothing but our veils. If anything turns up  we, as of now, freely accord it to him. If the money is elsewhere, it has  no doubt been deposited in someone's care; and that person, well aware of  the breach of trust, will hardly come forward, deal honorably by us, and  return it--rather, he will make off with it all. Mirza Musa must establish  a satisfactory proof of what he says; his claim alone is not evidence.\"  Mirza Musa replied: \"All the property was in their hands; I knew nothing  of what was going on--I had no hint of it. They did whatever they pleased.\"    In short, Mirza Musa had no clear proof of his claim. He could only ask,  \"Is such a thing possible, that the late Haji had no ready funds?\" Since  the claim was unsupported, I felt that pursuing it further would lead to a  scandal and produce nothing of value. Accordingly I bade them: \"Cast the  lots.\" As for the third share, I had them put it in a separate apartment,  close it off, and affix a seal to the door. The key I brought to  Baha'u'llah. \"The task is done,\" I said. \"It was accomplished only through  Your confirmations. Otherwise it could not have been completed in a year.  However, a difficulty has arisen.\" I described in detail the claim of  Mirza Musa and the absence of any proof. Then I said, \"Mirza Musa is  heavily in debt. Even should he expend all he has, still he could not pay  off his creditors. It is best, therefore, if You Yourself will accept the  heirs' request, since they persist in their offer, and bestow that share  on Mirza Musa. Then he could at least free himself from his debts and  still have something left over.\"    On the following day the heirs appeared and implored the Blessed Beauty to  have me accept the third share. \"This is out of the question,\" He told  them. Then they begged and entreated Him to accept that share Himself and  expend it for charitable purposes of His own choice. He answered: \"There  is only one purpose for which I might expend that sum.\" They said, \"That  is no concern of ours, even if You have it thrown into the sea. We will  not loose our hold from the hem of Your garment and we will not cease our  importunities until You accede to our request.\" Then He told them, \"I have  now accepted this third share; and I have given it to Mirza Musa, your  brother, but on the condition that, from this day forward, he will speak  no more of any claim against yourselves.\" The heirs were profuse in their  thanks. And so this weighty and difficult case was settled in a single  day. It left no residue of complaints, no uproar, no further quarrels.    Mirza Musa did his best to urge some of the jewels on me, but I refused.  Finally he requested that I accept a single ring. It was a precious ring,  set with a costly pomegranate ruby, a flawless sphere, and unique. All  around the central stone, it was gemmed with diamonds. This too I refused,  although I had no 'aba to my back and nothing to wear but a cotton tunic  that bespoke the antiquity of the world, nor did I own a copper coin. As  Hafiz would say: \"An empty purse, but in our sleeve a hoard.\"    Grateful for the bounty he had received, Mirza Musa offered Baha'u'llah  everything he possessed: orchards, lands, estates--but it was refused. Then  he appointed the 'ulamas of 'Iraq to intercede for him. They hastened to  Baha'u'llah in a body and begged Him to accept the proffered gifts. He  categorically refused. They respectfully told Him: \"Unless You accept, in  a very short time Mirza Musa will scatter it all to the winds. For his own  good, he should not have access to this wealth.\"    Then in his own hand, Mirza Musa penned deeds of gift, made out according  to each of the five creeds, in Arabic and Persian; two copies he made, and  chose the 'ulamas as his witnesses. Through certain 'ulamas of Ba_gh_dad,  among them the famed scholar 'Abdu's-Salam Effendi, and the erudite and  widely known Siyyid Davud Effendi, he presented the deed of gift to  Baha'u'llah. The Blessed Beauty told them: \"We are appointing Mirza Musa  himself as Our deputy.\"    After Baha'u'llah's departure for Rumelia, Mirza Musa, with a promissory  note, purchased from the Government the tithes of Hindiyyih, a district  near Karbila, and suffered a terrible loss, close to 100,000 tumans. The  Government confiscated his properties and sold them for next to nothing.  When told of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#18)"],[1,"ntry. He it  was who commanded that his vizir, to whom he owed his throne, be cast into  a caldron of boiling oil. As to his successor, the bigoted Muhammad  _Sh_ah, one of his earliest acts, definitely condemned by the pen of  Baha'u'llah, was the order to strangle his first minister, the illustrious  Qa'im-Maqam, immortalized by that same pen as the \"Prince of the City of  Statesmanship and Literary Accomplishment,\" and to have him replaced by  that lowbred, consummate scoundrel, Haji Mirza Aqasi, who brought the  country to the verge of bankruptcy and revolution. It was this same _Sh_ah  who refused to interview the Bab and imprisoned Him in A_dh_irbayjan, and  who, at the age of forty, was afflicted by a complication of maladies to  which he succumbed, hastening the doom forecast in these words of the  Qayyum-i-Asma: \"I swear by God, O _Sh_ah! If thou showest enmity unto Him  Who is His Remembrance, God will, on the Day of Resurrection, condemn  thee, before the kings, unto hellfire, and thou shalt not, in very truth,  find on that day any helper except God, the Exalted.\"    Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah, a selfish, capricious, imperious monarch, succeeded  to the throne, and, for half a century, was destined to remain the sole  arbiter of the fortunes of his hapless country. A disastrous obscurantism,  a chaotic administration in the provinces, the disorganization of the  finances of the realm, the intrigues, the vindictiveness, and profligacy  of the pampered and greedy courtiers, who buzzed and swarmed round his  throne, his own despotism which, but for the restraining fear of European  public opinion and the desire to be thought well of in the capitals of the  West, would have been more cruel and savage, were the distinguishing  features of the bloody reign of one who styled himself \"Footpath of  Heaven,\" and \"Asylum of the Universe.\" A triple darkness of chaos,  bankruptcy and oppression enveloped the country. His own assassination was  the first portent of the revolution which was to restrict the prerogatives  of his son and successor, depose the last two monarchs of the House of  Qajar, and extinguish their dynasty. On the eve of his jubilee, which was  to inaugurate a new era, and the celebration of which had been elaborately  prepared, he fell, in the shrine of _Sh_ah 'Abdu'l-'Azim, a victim to an  assassin's pistol, his dead body driven back to his capitol, propped up in  the royal carriage in front of his Grand Vizir, in order to defer the news  of his murder.    \"It was whispered,\" writes an eyewitness of both the ceremony and the  assassination, \"that the day of the _Sh_ah's celebration was to be the  greatest in the history of Persia.... Prisoners were to be released  without condition, and a general amnesty was to be proclaimed; peasants  were promised exemption from taxes for at least two years. ...the poor  were to be fed for months. Ministers and officials were already intriguing  for honors and pension from the _Sh_ah. Shrines and sacred places were to  open their gates to all wayfarers and pilgrims, and the siyyids and mullas  were taking cough medicine to clear their throats to sing and chant the  praises of the _Sh_ah in all the pulpits. The mosques were swept and  prepared for general meetings and public prayers in behalf of the  Sovereign.... Sacred fountains were enlarged to hold more holy water, and  the rightful authorities had foreseen that many miracles might take place  on the day of the jubilee, with the aid of these fountains.... The _Sh_ah  had declared ... that he would renounce his prerogatives as despot, and  proclaim himself 'The Majestic Father of all the Persians.' The city  authority was to relax its vigilant watch. No record was to be kept of the  strangers who flocked to the caravanserais, and the population was to be  left free to wander the streets during the whole night.\" Even the great  mujtahids had, according to what had been reported to that same  eyewitness, \"decided, for the time being, to discontinue persecuting the  Babis and other infidels.\"    Thus fell the one whose reign will remain forever associated with the most  heinous crime in history--the martyrdom of that One Whom the Supreme  Manifestation of God proclaimed to be the \"Point round Whom the realities  of the Prophets and Messengers revolve.\" In a Tablet in which the pen of  Baha'u'llah condemns him, we read: \"Among them [kings of the earth] is the  King of Persia, who suspended Him Who is the Temple of the Cause [the Bab]  in the air, and put Him to death with such cruelty that all created  things, and the inmates of Paradise, and the Concourse on high wept for  Him. He slew, moreover, some of Our kindred, and plundered Our property,  and made Our family captives in the hands of the oppressors. Once and  again he imprisoned Me. By God, the True One! None can reckon the things  which befell Me in prison, save God, the Reckoner, the Omniscient, the  Almighty. Subsequently he banished Me and My family from My country,  whereupon We arrived in 'Iraq in evident sorrow. We tarried there until  the time when the King of Rum [Sultan of Turkey] arose against Us, and  summoned Us unto the seat of his sovereignty. When We reached it there  flowed over Us that whereat the King of Persia rejoiced. Later We entered  this Prison, wherein the hands of Our loved ones were torn from the hem of  Our robe. In such a manner hath he dealt with Us!\"    The days of the Qajar dynasty were now numbered. The torpor of the  national consciousness had vanished. The reign of Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah's  successor, Muzaffari'd-Din _Sh_ah, a weak and timid creature, extravagant  and lavish to his courtiers, led the country down the broad road to ruin.  The movement in favor of a constitution, limiting the sovereign's  prerogatives, gathered force, and culminated in the signature of the  constitution by the dying _Sh_ah, who expired a few days later.  Muhammad-'Ali _Sh_ah, a despot of the worst type, unprincipled and  avaricious, succeeded to the throne. Hostile to the constitution, he, by  his summary action, involving the bombardment of the Baharistan, where the  Assembly met, precipitated a revolution which led to his deposition by the  nationalists. Accepting, after much bargaining, a large pension, he  ignominiously withdrew to Russia. The boy-king, Ahmad _Sh_ah, who  succeeded him, was a mere cipher and careless of his duties. The crying  needs of his country continued to be ignored. Increasing anarchy, the  impotence of the central government, the state of the national finances,  the progressive deterioration of the general condition of the country,  practically abandoned by a sovereign who preferred the gaieties and  frivolities of society life in the European capitals to the discharge of  the stern and urgent responsibilities which the plight of his nation  demanded, sounded the death knell of a dynasty which, it was generally  felt, had forfeited the crown. Whilst abroad, on one of his periodic  visits, Parliament deposed him, and proclaimed the extinction of his  dynasty, which had occupied the throne of Persia for a hundred and thirty  years, whose rulers proudly claimed no less a descent than from Japhet,  son of Noah, and whose successive monarchs, with only one exception, were  either assassinated, deposed, or struck down by mortal disease.    Their myriad progeny, a veritable \"beehive of princelings,\" a \"race of  royal drones,\" were both a disgrace and a menace to their countrymen. Now,  however, these luckless descendants of a fallen house, shorn of all power,  and some of them reduced even to beggary, proclaim, in their distress, the  consequences of the abominations which their progenitors have perpetrated.  Swelling the ranks of the ill-fated scions of the House of U_th_man, and  of the rulers of the Romanov, the Hohenzollern, the Hapsburg, and the  Napoleonic dynasties, they roam the face of the earth, scarcely aware of  the character of those forces which have operated such tragic revolutions  in their lives, and so powerfully contributed to their present plight.    Already grandsons of both Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah and of Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz  have, in their powerlessness and destitution, turned to the World Center  of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and sought respectively political aid and  pecuniary assistance. In the case of the former, the request was promptly  and firmly refused, whilst in the case of the latter it was unhesitatingly  offered.            THE DECLINE IN THE FORTUNES OF ROYALTY      And as we survey in other fields the decline in the fortunes of royalty,  whether in the years immediately preceding the Great War or after, and  contemplate the fate that has overtaken the Chinese Empire, the Portuguese  and Spanish Monarchies, and more recently the vicissitudes that have  afflicted, and are still afflicting, the sovereigns of Norway, of Denmark  and of Holland, and observe the impotence of their fellow-sovereigns, and  note the fear and trembling that has seized their thrones, may we not  associate their plight with the opening passages of the Suriy-i-Muluk,  which, in view of their momentous significance, I feel impelled to quote a  second time: \"Fear God, O concourse of kings, and suffer not yourselves to  be deprived of this most sublime grace.... Set your hearts towards the  face of God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to  follow, and be not of those who perish.... Ye examined not His [the Bab's]  Cause, when so to do had been better for you than all that the sun shineth  upon, could ye but perceive it.... Beware that ye be not careless  henceforth, as ye have been careless aforetime.... My face hath come forth  from the veils, and shed its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on  earth, and yet ye turned not towards Him.... Arise then ... and make ye  amends for that which hath escaped you.... If ye pay no heed unto the  counsels which, in peerless and unequivocal language, We have"]]]
