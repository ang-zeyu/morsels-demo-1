Charles de Boues, vicar-general of Pontoise, had also made a  personal subscription, and accepted the protectorate of the convent,  together with the title of syndic of Canadian missions. Other piously  disposed persons had also contributed towards the maintenance of the  religious institution.    The establishment of a convent in Canada was a ray of light amid the  gloom which had hung over the settlement of New France during the past  four years, but the rejoicing on this occasion was soon turned into  mourning by the unexpected death of Friar du Plessis, who died at Three  Rivers on August 23rd, 1619. There were two other deaths during this  year which cast a shadow on the colony, that of Anne Hebert, and of her  husband, Etienne Jonquest, who survived his wife only a few weeks.    The mission at Three Rivers was placed under the charge of Father Le  Caron, and from this date it was the object of the most pastoral  solicitude of the Recollets.          CHAPTER VII    FUR TRADE      The earliest reference by Champlain to the fur trade in Canada, is  contained in his relation of his voyage to Tadousac in the year 1603.  During this journey he encountered a number of Indians in a canoe, near  Hare Island, among whom was an Algonquin who appeared to be well versed  in the geography of the country watered by the Great Lakes. As a proof  of his knowledge, he gave to Champlain a description of the rapids of  the St. Lawrence, of Niagara Falls and Lake Ontario. When questioned as  to the natural resources of the country, he stated that he was  acquainted with a people called the good Iroquois (Hurons) who were  accustomed to exchange their peltry for the goods which the French had  given to the Algonquins. We have in this statement proof that the French  were known to the inhabitants of New France before the year 1603.    In the year 1608, trading was conducted with the Indians at Tadousac,  but in 1610 it was alternately at Tadousac, and near Cape de la Victoire  at the entrance of the Richelieu River. During the latter period, the  fur trade was a failure, although the vessels annually carried from  twelve to fifteen thousand skins to France, which were sold at one  pistole each. From the year 1610, Tadousac ceased to be the rendezvous  of traders, and the great centre was at Sault St. Louis, until the year  1618. From this time, for several consecutive years, Three Rivers was  the principal trading-post, and finally the Indians went down to Quebec,  or to Cape de la Victoire, or du Massacre, and at a still later period  the Isle of Richelieu, opposite the parish of Deschambault, some fifteen  leagues above Quebec, was chosen as a trading-place.    Champlain was not opposed to the fur trade; on the contrary, he favoured  it, provided that it was conducted honestly, as it afforded him  opportunities for making new discoveries, and also for maintaining  friendly relationship with the Indians. The Recollets had no connection  with the trade, although through their efforts commercial intercourse  was often facilitated.    Speaking of the trading of 1618, Champlain mentions a class of men who  eventually attained considerable influence in colonial affairs. These  men were the factors or clerks employed and paid by the merchants. Some  of them obtained notoriety on account of their treason and bad conduct,  while others were distinguished by their devotedness to Champlain and  the missionaries. The clerks or factors were engaged by the fur trading  merchants who had their principal factory at Quebec. The staff consisted  of a chief clerk, of clerks and underclerks; and their functions were  to receive merchandise on its arrival, to place it in the store, and  when the trading was complete, to exchange the goods for skins, which  were then carefully packed for exportation. The clerks visited the  places chosen by the Indians for trading, and generally conducted the  exchanges themselves. Some of them employed the services of interpreters  who were readily found, and were frequently sent among the natives to  induce them to visit the clerks. The duties of the clerks were not  always easily performed. They had many difficulties to encounter, but as  successful trading might lead to future promotion, there were advantages  connected with the office. Thierry-Desdames, one of the underclerks at  Quebec in 1622, was appointed captain of the Island of Miscou, in  recognition of his faithful service. This is not the only instance of  promotion recorded by Champlain. Beauchesne and Loquin are also  mentioned in the Relations of 1618 and 1619.    When Champlain returned from France in 1620, he was accompanied by Jean  Baptiste Guers, the business representative of the Duke of Montmorency,  who rendered good service to Champlain and the settlers. In the same  year Pont-Grave traded at Three Rivers, and he was assisted by two  clerks called Loquin and Caumont, and an underclerk, Rouvier. Before  leaving for France, Pont-Grave placed Caumont in charge of his factory.  Rouvier also left for France, under the pretext that the company  refused to increase his wages. The departure of a clerk, however, was of  small importance, when we consider the trouble which had arisen among  the associates.    In the year 1612, Champlain, it appears, had placed too much confidence  in the influence of Henri de Conde, viceroy of New France. This nobleman  proved to be a source of trouble rather than a friend to the new colony.  Two years after, Champlain formed an association of the merchants of St.  Malo and Rouen, who invested a large capital for the development of  trade in Quebec. The chief members of the company were Francois Porree,  Lucas Legendre, Louis Vermeulle, Mathieu d'Insterlo, Pierre Eon, Thomas  Cochon, Pierre Trublet, Vincent Grave, Daniel Boyer and Corneille de  Bellois. By its constitution the operations of the company were to  extend over a period of eleven years, and its members engaged to  maintain the habitation of Quebec, and a fort, and to build new forts if  necessary, and also to pay the expenses of missionaries, and to send  labourers and workmen to Canada. The Prince de Conde received a salary  of three thousand livres, and the payment of this large amount annually  to the viceroy, caused the merchants to neglect their obligations  towards Champlain.    In the meantime Conde conspired against the Queen Regent and was  incarcerated, and the Marechal de Themines was temporarily appointed in  his place. The office of secretary to the viceroy would appear to have  been lucrative, for one applicant, probably Boyer, offered Themines four  thousand five hundred livres, if he would appoint him to the position.  Conde protested against the charge which had been made against his  agreement, and asked for his salary. De Villemenon, intendant of the  admiralty, opposed the application, and claimed the amount of the salary  for the Quebec settlement.    While Champlain was present in France in 1617 he received a proscription  from the court of parliament, ordering him to resign his office of  lieutenant of the viceroy, as the Company of Rouen had decided to  suppress the salary of the viceroy. Champlain did not take any notice of  this injunction, but started for Quebec. On his return to France during  the same year (1617) Champlain met the Marechal de Themines, in order to  induce him, in his capacity of viceroy, to take some interest in the  affairs of New France, as the situation there was becoming  insupportable. The great personages were quarrelling over money matters;  the people of St. Malo were renewing their demands for liberty of  commerce, and the merchants were refusing to invest new capital.  Champlain had a series of difficulties, which he endeavoured to remove  before his return to Quebec, and he drew up his grievances in two large  factums, one of which was presented to the king, and the other to the  Board of Trade of Paris.    In the factum to the king Champlain explained that France would derive  benefit from the colonization of Canada, provided workmen and labourers  were sent to the country. He also set forth the necessity of improving  the defense of the colony, as an attack might be expected at any time  from the English or Dutch. Champlain pointed out to the king, at the  same time, that by developing New France, he would be propagating the  Catholic faith amongst infidels, and that he would add to his wealth by  reason of the revenue to be derived from the vast forests of Canada. He  also made known to the king some of the projects which he had in view.  Amongst these were certain buildings and works which he proposed to  carry out. Quebec was to be named _Ludovica_, in honour of the king. A  church was to be erected and dedicated under the title of _Redeemer_,  and a fort was to be constructed on the cape of Quebec, flanked with  four bastions, which would command the river St. Lawrence. A second fort  was to be built opposite Quebec, which would complete the defense of the  face of the town, and a third fort would be constructed at Tadousac on a  promontory naturally fortified, to be manned by a garrison which would  be relieved every six months.    These arrangements would provide for the defense of the country.  Champlain also intended to look after the education and the spiritual  wants of the settlement, by sending fifteen friars of the Recollet  order to New France, who were to found a convent near the Church of the  Redeemer. The king was also asked to send one hundred families to the  colony, each composed of a husband and wife and two children or a  servant under twenty years of age. With these provisions Champlain  believed that a settlement might be established in the name of France,  which would remain loyal to her interests, since it would rest upon the  sure foundation of strength, justice, commerce, and agriculture.

Also try to  estimate the weight of the odorous particles that guide a dog to the fox  or warn a deer of the presence of man. The unaided nostril can rival the  spectroscope in the detection and analysis of unweighable amounts of  matter.    What we call flavor or savor is a joint effect of taste and odor in  which the latter predominates. There are only four tastes of importance,  acid, alkaline, bitter and sweet. The acid, or sour taste, is the  perception of hydrogen atoms charged with positive electricity. The  alkaline, or soapy taste, is the perception of hydroxyl radicles charged  with negative electricity. The bitter and sweet tastes and all the odors  depend upon the chemical constitution of the compound, but the laws of  the relation have not yet been worked out. Since these sense organs, the  taste and smell buds, are sunk in the moist mucous membrane they can  only be touched by substances soluble in water, and to reach the sense  of smell they must also be volatile so as to be diffused in the air  inhaled by the nose. The \"taste\" of food is mostly due to the volatile  odors of it that creep up the back-stairs into the olfactory chamber.    A chemist given an unknown substance would have to make an elementary  analysis and some tedious tests to determine whether it contained methyl  or ethyl groups, whether it was an aldehyde or an ester, whether the  carbon atoms were singly or doubly linked and whether it was an open  chain or closed. But let him get a whiff of it and he can give instantly  a pretty shrewd guess as to these points. His nose knows.    Although the chemist does not yet know enough to tell for certain from  looking at the structural formula what sort of odor the compound would  have or whether it would have any, yet we can divide odoriferous  substances into classes according to their constitution. What are  commonly known as \"fruity\" odors belong mostly to what the chemist calls  the fatty or aliphatic series. For instance, we may have in a ripe fruit  an alcohol (say ethyl or common alcohol) and an acid (say acetic or  vinegar) and a combination of these, the ester or organic salt (in this  case ethyl acetate), which is more odorous than either of its  components. These esters of the fatty acids give the characteristic  savor to many of our favorite fruits, candies and beverages. The pear  flavor, amyl acetate, is made from acetic acid and amyl alcohol--though  amyl alcohol (fusel oil) has a detestable smell. Pineapple is ethyl  butyrate--but the acid part of it (butyric acid) is what gives Limburger  cheese its aroma. These essential oils are easily made in the  laboratory, but cannot be extracted from the fruit for separate use.    If the carbon chain contains one or more double linkages we get the  \"flowery\" perfumes. For instance, here is the symbol of geraniol, the  chief ingredient of otto of roses:      (CH_{3})_{2}C = CHCH_{2}CH_{2}C(CH_{3})_{2} = CHCH_{2}OH    The rose would smell as sweet under another name, but it may be  questioned whether it would stand being called by the name of  dimethyl-2-6-octadiene-2-6-ol-8. Geraniol by oxidation goes into the  aldehyde, citral, which occurs in lemons, oranges and verbena flowers.  Another compound of this group, linalool, is found in lavender, bergamot  and many flowers.    Geraniol, as you would see if you drew up its structural formula in the  way I described in the last chapter, contains a chain of six carbon  atoms, that is, the same number as make a benzene ring. Now if we shake  up geraniol and other compounds of this group (the diolefines) with  diluted sulfuric acid the carbon chain hooks up to form a benzene ring,  but with the other carbon atoms stretched across it; rather too  complicated to depict here. These \"bridged rings\" of the formula  C_{5}H_{8}, or some multiple of that, constitute the important group of  the terpenes which occur in turpentine and such wild and woodsy things  as sage, lavender, caraway, pine needles and eucalyptus. Going further  in this direction we are led into the realm of the heavy oriental odors,  patchouli, sandalwood, cedar, cubebs, ginger and camphor. Camphor can  now be made directly from turpentine so we may be independent of Formosa  and Borneo.    When we have a six carbon ring without double linkings (cyclo-aliphatic)  or with one or two such, we get soft and delicate perfumes like the  violet (ionone and irone). But when these pass into the benzene ring  with its three double linkages the odor becomes more powerful and so  characteristic that the name \"aromatic compound\" has been extended to  the entire class of benzene derivatives, although many of them are  odorless. The essential oils of jasmine, orange blossoms, musk,  heliotrope, tuberose, ylang ylang, etc., consist mostly of this class  and can be made from the common source of aromatic compounds, coal tar.    The synthetic flavors and perfumes are made in the same way as the dyes  by starting with some coal-tar product or other crude material and  building up the molecule to the desired complexity. For instance, let us  start with phenol, the ill-smelling and poisonous carbolic acid of  disagreeable associations and evil fame. Treat this to soda-water and it  is transformed into salicylic acid, a white odorless powder, used as a  preservative and as a rheumatism remedy. Add to this methyl alcohol  which is obtained by the destructive distillation of wood and is much  more poisonous than ordinary ethyl alcohol. The alcohol and the acid  heated together will unite with the aid of a little sulfuric acid and we  get what the chemist calls methyl salicylate and other people call oil  of wintergreen, the same as is found in wintergreen berries and birch  bark. We have inherited a taste for this from our pioneer ancestors and  we use it extensively to flavor our soft drinks, gum, tooth paste and  candy, but the Europeans have not yet found out how nice it is.    But, starting with phenol again, let us heat it with caustic alkali and  chloroform. This gives us two new compounds of the same composition, but  differing a little in the order of the atoms. If you refer back to the  diagram of the benzene ring which I gave in the last chapter, you will  see that there are six hydrogen atoms attached to it. Now any or all  these hydrogen atoms may be replaced by other elements or groups and  what the product is depends not only on what the new elements are, but  where they are put. It is like spelling words. The three letters _t_,  _r_ and _a_ mean very different things according to whether they are put  together as _art_, _tar_ or _rat_. Or, to take a more apposite  illustration, every hostess knows that the success of her dinner depends  upon how she seats her guests around the table. So in the case of  aromatic compounds, a little difference in the seating arrangement  around the benzene ring changes the character. The two derivatives of  phenol, which we are now considering, have two substituting groups. One  is--O-H (called the hydroxyl group). The other is--CHO (called the  aldehyde group). If these are opposite (called the para position) we  have an odorless white solid. If they are side by side (called the ortho  position) we have an oil with the odor of meadowsweet. Treating the  odorless solid with methyl alcohol we get audepine (or anisic aldehyde)  which is the perfume of hawthorn blossoms. But treating the other of the  twin products, the fragrant oil, with dry acetic acid (\"Perkin's  reaction\") we get cumarin, which is the perfume part of the tonka or  tonquin beans that our forefathers used to carry in their snuff boxes.  One ounce of cumarin is equal to four pounds of tonka beans. It smells  sufficiently like vanilla to be used as a substitute for it in cheap  extracts. In perfumery it is known as \"new mown hay.\"    You may remember what I said on a former page about the career of  William Henry Perkin, the boy who loved chemistry better than eating,  and how he discovered the coal-tar dyes. Well, it is also to his  ingenious mind that we owe the starting of the coal-tar perfume business  which has had almost as important a development. Perkin made cumarin in  1868, but this, like the dye industry, escaped from English hands and  flew over the North Sea. Before the war Germany was exporting  $1,500,000 worth of synthetic perfumes a year. Part of these went to  France, where they were mixed and put up in fancy bottles with French  names and sold to Americans at fancy prices.    The real vanilla flavor, vanillin, was made by Tiemann in 1874. At first  it sold for nearly $800 a pound, but now it may be had for $10. How  extensively it is now used in chocolate, ice cream, soda water, cakes  and the like we all know. It should be noted that cumarin and vanillin,  however they may be made, are not imitations, but identical with the  chief constituent of the tonka and vanilla beans and, of course, are  equally wholesome or harmless. But the nice palate can distinguish a  richer flavor in the natural extracts, for they contain small quantities  of other savory ingredients.    A true perfume consists of a large number of odoriferous chemical  compounds mixed in such proportions as to produce a single harmonious  effect upon the sense of smell in a fine brand of perfume may be  compounded a dozen or twenty different ingredients and these, if they  are natural essences, are complex mixtures of a dozen or so distinct  substances. Perfumery is one of the fine arts. The perfumer, like the  orchestra leader, must know how to combine and cooerdinate his  instruments to produce a desired sensation. A Wagnerian opera requires  103 musicians. A Strauss opera requires 112. Now if the concert manager  wants to economize he will insist upon cutting down on the most  expensive musicians and dropping out some of the others, say, the  supernumerary violinists and the man who blows a single blast or tinkles  a"]]]
