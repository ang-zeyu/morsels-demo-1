She looked back at him and slowed her pace. He slowed  also. She stopped. He at once stopped too, keeping two hundred yards  behind her. Her next movement was as unexpected as it was spirited. She  suddenly whisked her wheels round and dashed straight at him! He was as  quick as she, however, and darted off in desperate flight. Presently she  came back up the road again, her head haughtily in the air, not deigning  to take any further notice of her silent attendant. He had turned also,  and still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my  sight.    I remained in my hiding-place, and it was well that I did so, for  presently the man reappeared cycling slowly back. He turned in at the  Hall gates and dismounted from his machine. For some few minutes I could  see him standing among the trees. His hands were raised and he seemed to  be settling his necktie. Then he mounted his cycle and rode away from  me down the drive towards the Hall. I ran across the heath and peered  through the trees. Far away I could catch glimpses of the old grey  building with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the drive ran through a  dense shrubbery, and I saw no more of my man.    However, it seemed to me that I had done a fairly good morning's work,  and I walked back in high spirits to Farnham. The local house-agent  could tell me nothing about Charlington Hall, and referred me to a  well-known firm in Pall Mall. There I halted on my way home, and met  with courtesy from the representative. No, I could not have Charlington  Hall for the summer. I was just too late. It had been let about a month  ago. Mr. Williamson was the name of the tenant. He was a respectable  elderly gentleman. The polite agent was afraid he could say no more, as  the affairs of his clients were not matters which he could discuss.    Mr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to the long report which I  was able to present to him that evening, but it did not elicit that  word of curt praise which I had hoped for and should have valued. On  the contrary, his austere face was even more severe than usual as he  commented upon the things that I had done and the things that I had not.    \"Your hiding-place, my dear Watson, was very faulty. You should have  been behind the hedge; then you would have had a close view of this  interesting person. As it is you were some hundreds of yards away, and  can tell me even less than Miss Smith. She thinks she does not know  the man; I am convinced she does. Why, otherwise, should he be so  desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his  features? You describe him as bending over the handle-bar. Concealment  again, you see. You really have done remarkably badly. He returns to  the house and you want to find out who he is. You come to a London  house-agent!\"    \"What should I have done?\" I cried, with some heat.    \"Gone to the nearest public-house. That is the centre of country  gossip. They would have told you every name, from the master to the  scullery-maid. Williamson! It conveys nothing to my mind. If he is an  elderly man he is not this active cyclist who sprints away from that  athletic young lady's pursuit. What have we gained by your expedition?  The knowledge that the girl's story is true. I never doubted it. That  there is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall. I never doubted  that either. That the Hall is tenanted by Williamson. Who's the better  for that? Well, well, my dear sir, don't look so depressed. We can do  little more until next Saturday, and in the meantime I may make one or  two inquiries myself.\"    Next morning we had a note from Miss Smith, recounting shortly and  accurately the very incidents which I had seen, but the pith of the  letter lay in the postscript:--    \"I am sure that you will respect my confidence, Mr. Holmes, when I tell  you that my place here has become difficult owing to the fact that my  employer has proposed marriage to me. I am convinced that his feelings  are most deep and most honourable. At the same time my promise is, of  course, given. He took my refusal very seriously, but also very gently.  You can understand, however, that the situation is a little strained.\"    \"Our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters,\" said Holmes,  thoughtfully, as he finished the letter. \"The case certainly presents  more features of interest and more possibility of development than I had  originally thought. I should be none the worse for a quiet, peaceful day  in the country, and I am inclined to run down this afternoon and test  one or two theories which I have formed.\"    Holmes's quiet day in the country had a singular termination, for  he arrived at Baker Street late in the evening with a cut lip and a  discoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of dissipation  which would have made his own person the fitting object of a Scotland  Yard investigation. He was immensely tickled by his own adventures, and  laughed heartily as he recounted them.    \"I get so little active exercise that it is always a treat,\" said he.  \"You are aware that I have some proficiency in the good old British  sport of boxing. Occasionally it is of service. To-day, for example, I  should have come to very ignominious grief without it.\"    I begged him to tell me what had occurred.    \"I found that country pub which I had already recommended to your  notice, and there I made my discreet inquiries. I was in the bar, and  a garrulous landlord was giving me all that I wanted. Williamson is a  white-bearded man, and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at  the Hall. There is some rumour that he is or has been a clergyman; but  one or two incidents of his short residence at the Hall struck me as  peculiarly unecclesiastical. I have already made some inquiries at a  clerical agency, and they tell me that there WAS a man of that name in  orders whose career has been a singularly dark one. The landlord further  informed me that there are usually week-end visitors--'a warm lot,  sir'--at the Hall, and especially one gentleman with a red moustache,  Mr. Woodley by name, who was always there. We had got as far as this  when who should walk in but the gentleman himself, who had been drinking  his beer in the tap-room and had heard the whole conversation. Who was  I? What did I want? What did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine  flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. He ended a  string of abuse by a vicious back-hander which I failed to entirely  avoid. The next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight left  against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me. Mr. Woodley went  home in a cart. So ended my country trip, and it must be confessed that,  however enjoyable, my day on the Surrey border has not been much more  profitable than your own.\"    The Thursday brought us another letter from our client.    \"You will not be surprised, Mr. Holmes,\" said she, \"to hear that I am  leaving Mr. Carruthers's employment. Even the high pay cannot reconcile  me to the discomforts of my situation. On Saturday I come up to town  and I do not intend to return. Mr. Carruthers has got a trap, and so  the dangers of the lonely road, if there ever were any dangers, are now  over.    \"As to the special cause of my leaving, it is not merely the strained  situation with Mr. Carruthers, but it is the reappearance of that odious  man, Mr. Woodley. He was always hideous, but he looks more awful  than ever now, for he appears to have had an accident and he is much  disfigured. I saw him out of the window, but I am glad to say I did  not meet him. He had a long talk with Mr. Carruthers, who seemed much  excited afterwards. Woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood, for he  did not sleep here, and yet I caught a glimpse of him again this morning  slinking about in the shrubbery. I would sooner have a savage wild  animal loose about the place. I loathe and fear him more than I can say.  How CAN Mr. Carruthers endure such a creature for a moment? However, all  my troubles will be over on Saturday.\"    \"So I trust, Watson; so I trust,\" said Holmes, gravely. \"There is some  deep intrigue going on round that little woman, and it is our duty to  see that no one molests her upon that last journey. I think, Watson,  that we must spare time to run down together on Saturday morning,  and make sure that this curious and inconclusive investigation has no  untoward ending.\"    I confess that I had not up to now taken a very serious view of  the case, which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre than  dangerous. That a man should lie in wait for and follow a very handsome  woman is no unheard-of thing, and if he had so little audacity that he  not only dared not address her, but even fled from her approach, he  was not a very formidable assailant. The ruffian Woodley was a very  different person, but, except on one occasion, he had not molested our  client, and now he visited the house of Carruthers without intruding  upon her presence. The man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of  those week-end parties at the Hall of which the publican had spoken; but  who he was or what he wanted was as obscure as ever. It was the severity  of Holmes's manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his  pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that  tragedy might prove to lurk behind this curious train of events.    A rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and the  heath-covered country-side with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse  seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the duns and  drabs and slate-greys of London. Holmes and I walked along the broad,  sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air, and rejoicing in the music of  the birds and the fresh breath of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#18)"],[1," a dozen more were  in my coat sleeve. I jumped away as he turned, and so escaped the quick  double swing of his tail at my legs. Then he rolled into a chestnut bur  again, and proclaimed mockingly at every point: \"Touch me if you dare!\"    I pulled the two quills with sharp jerks out of my hand, pushed all the  others through my coat sleeve, and turned to Unk Wunk again, sucking my  wounded hand, which pained me intensely. \"All your own fault,\" I kept  telling myself, to keep from whacking him across the nose, his one  vulnerable point, with my stick.    Unk Wunk, on his part, seemed to have forgotten the incident. He  unrolled himself slowly and loafed along the foot of the ridge, his  quills spreading and rustling as he went, as if there were not such a  thing as an enemy or an inquisitive man in all the woods.    He had an idea in his head by this time and was looking for something.  As I followed close behind him, he would raise himself against a small  tree, survey it solemnly for a moment or two, and go on unsatisfied. A  breeze had come down from the mountain and was swaying all the tree-tops  above him. He would look up steadily at the tossing branches, and then  hurry on to survey the next little tree he met, with paws raised against  the trunk and dull eyes following the motion overhead.    At last he found what he wanted,--two tall saplings growing close  together and rubbing each other as the wind swayed them. He climbed one  of these clumsily, higher and higher, till the slender top bent with his  weight towards the other. Then he reached out to grasp the second top  with his fore paws, hooked his hind claws firmly into the first, and lay  there binding the tree-tops together, while the wind rose and began to  rock him in his strange cradle.    Wider and wilder he swung, now stretched out thin, like a rubber string,  his quills lying hard and flat against his sides as the tree-tops  separated in the wind; now jammed up against himself as they came  together again, pressing him into a flat ring with spines sticking  straight out, like a chestnut bur that has been stepped upon. And there  he swayed for a full hour, till it grew too dark to see him, stretching,  contracting, stretching, contracting, as if he were an accordion and the  wind were playing him. His only note, meanwhile, was an occasional  squealing grunt of satisfaction after some particularly good stretch, or  when the motion changed and both trees rocked together in a wide, wild,  exhilarating swing. Now and then the note was answered, farther down the  ridge, by another porcupine going to sleep in his lofty cradle. A storm  was coming; and Unk Wunk, who is one of the wood's best barometers to  foretell the changing weather, was crying it aloud where all might hear.    So my question was answered unexpectedly. Unk Wunk was out for fun that  afternoon, and had rolled down the hill for the joy of the swift motion  and the dizzy feeling afterwards, as other wood folk do. I have watched  young foxes, whose den was on a steep hill side, rolling down one after  the other, and sometime varying the programme by having one cub roll as  fast as he could, while another capered alongside, snapping and worrying  him in his brain-muddling tumble.    That is all very well for foxes. One expects to find such an idea in  wise little heads. But who taught Unk Wunk to roll downhill and stick  his spines full of dry leaves to scare the wood folk? And when did he  learn to use the tree-tops for his swing and the wind for his motive  power?    Perhaps--since most of what the wood folk know is a matter of learning,  not of instinct--his mother teaches him some things that we have never  yet seen. If so, Unk Wunk has more in his sleepy, stupid head than we  have given him credit for, and there is a very interesting lesson  awaiting him who shall first find and enter the porcupine school.    [Illustration]          The Partridges' Roll Call    [Illustration]      I was fishing, one September afternoon, in the pool at the foot of the  lake, trying in twenty ways, as the dark evergreen shadows lengthened  across the water, to beguile some wary old trout into taking my flies.  They lived there, a score of them, in a dark well among the lily pads,  where a cold spring bubbled up from the bottom; and their moods and  humors were a perpetual source of worry or amusement, according to the  humor of the fisherman himself.    For days at a time they would lie in the deep shade of the lily pads in  stupid or sullen indifference. Then nothing tempted them. Flies, worms,  crickets, redfins, bumblebees,--all at the end of dainty hair leaders,  were drawn with crinkling wavelets over their heads, or dropped gently  beside them; but they only swirled sullenly aside, grouty as King Ahab  when he turned his face to the wall and would eat no bread.    At such times scores of little fish swarmed out of the pads and ran riot  in the pool. Chub, shiners, \"punkin-seeds,\" perch, boiled up at your  flies, or chased each other in savage warfare through the forbidden  water, which seemed to intoxicate them by its cool freshness. You had  only to swing your canoe up near the shadowy edge of the pool and draw  your cast once across the open water to know whether or not you would  eat trout for breakfast. If the small fish chased your flies, then you  might as well go home or study nature; you would certainly get no trout.  But you could never tell when the change would come. With the smallest  occasion sometimes--a coolness in the air, the run of a cat's-paw  breeze, a cloud shadow drifting over--a transformation would sweep over  the speckled Ahabs lying deep under the lily pads. Some blind, unknown  warning would run through the pool before ever a trout had changed his  position. Looking over the side of your canoe you would see the little  fish darting helter-skelter away among the pads, seeking safety in  shallow water, leaving the pool to its tyrant masters. Now is the time  to begin casting; your trout are ready to rise.    A playful mood would often follow the testy humor. The plunge of a  three-pound fish, the slap-dash of a dozen smaller ones would startle  you into nervous casting. But again you might as well spare your  efforts, which only served to acquaint the trout with the best frauds  in your fly book. They would rush at Hackle or Coachman or Silver  Doctor, swirl under it, jump over it, but never take it in. They played  with floating leaves; their wonderful eyes caught the shadow of a  passing mosquito across the silver mirror of their roof, and their broad  tails flung them up to intercept it; but they wanted nothing more than  play or exercise, and they would not touch your flies.    Once in a way there would come a day when your study and patience found  their rich reward. The slish of a line, the flutter of a fly dropping  softly on the farther edge of the pool--and then the shriek of your  reel, buzzing up the quiet hillside, was answered by a loud snort, as  the deer that lived there bounded away in alarm, calling her two fawns  to follow. But you scarcely noticed; your head and hands were too full,  trying to keep the big trout away from the lily pads, where you would  certainly lose him with your light tackle.    On the afternoon of which I write the trout were neither playful nor  sullen. No more were they hungry. The first cast of my midget flies  across the pool brought no answer. That was good; the little fish had  been ordered out, evidently. Larger flies followed; but the big trout  neither played with them nor let them alone. They followed cautiously, a  foot astern, to the near edge of the lily pads, till they saw me and  swirled down again to their cool haunts. They were suspicious clearly;  and with the lower orders, as with men, the best rule in such a case is  to act naturally, with more quietness than usual, and give them time to  get over their suspicion.    As I waited, my flies resting among the pads near the canoe, curious  sounds came floating down the hillside--_Prut, prut, pr-r-r-rt!  Whit-kwit? whit-kwit? Pr-r-rt, pr-r-rt! Ooo-it, ooo-it? Pr-r-reeee_!  this last with a swift burr of wings. And the curious sounds, half  questioning, half muffled in extreme caution, gave a fleeting impression  of gliding in and out among the tangled underbrush. \"A flock of  partridges--ruffed grouse,\" I thought, and turned to listen more  intently.    The shadows had grown long, with a suggestion of coming night; and other  ears than mine had heard the sounds with interest. A swifter shadow fell  on the water, and I looked up quickly to see a big owl sail silently out  from the opposite hill and perch on a blasted stub overlooking the pool.  Kookooskoos had been sleeping in a dark spruce when the sounds waked  him, and he started out instantly, not to hunt--it was still too  bright--but to locate his game and follow silently to the roosting  place, near which he would hide and wait till the twilight fell darkly.  I could see it all in his attitude as he poised forward, swinging his  round head to and fro, like a dog on an air trail, locating the flock  accurately before he should take another flight.    Up on the hillside the eager sounds had stopped for a moment, as if some  strange sixth sense had warned the birds to be silent. The owl was  puzzled; but I dared not move, because he was looking straight over me.  Some faint sound, too faint for my ears, made him turn his head, and on  the instant I reached for the tiny rifle lying before me in the canoe.  Just as he spread his wings to investigate the new sound, the little  rifle spoke, and he tumbled heavily to the shore.    \"One robber the less,\" I was thinking, when the canoe swung slightly on  the water. There was a heavy plunge, a vicious rush of my unheeded line,  and I seized my rod to find myself fast to a big trout, which had been  watching my flies from his hiding among the lily pads till his"]]]
