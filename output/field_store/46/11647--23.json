This wall rises to a height of about 4 feet before  it meets the overhanging cliff, and consequently there is a long narrow  passageway, about 3 feet high and 3 feet wide on the bottom, between it  and the cliff. A small man might wriggle through, but with difficulty.    The ruin commands a fine outlook over the cove. The masonry is good,  being composed of selected stone well chinked with small spalls, and  sometimes with bits of clay pressed in with the fingers.    Figure 47 shows a ruin located at the point marked 37 on the map. There  is a high slope of talus here, the top of which is flat and of  considerable area.    The ruin is invisible from below in its present condition, but the site  commands a fine outlook over several considerable areas of bottom land.  The walls are now much obliterated and worked over by the Navaho, but  the remains are scattered over quite an extensive area and may have been  at one time an extensive settlement; however, no traces of a kiva can  now be seen. Marks on the cliff show that some of the houses had been  three stories high. Some places on the cliff, which were apparently  back-walls of rooms, were plastered and coated with white, and there are  many pictographs on the rock. The masonry is of fair quality, but the  stones were laid with more mortar than usual.      [Illustration: Fig. 48--Plan of cliff ruin No. 46.]    Figure 48 is a ground plan of a ruin which occurs at the point marked 46  on the map. It is situated in a cove in the rock at the top of the  talus, 300 or 400 feet above the bottom, and immediately above the  rectangular single room described and illustrated on page 151. It  commands an extensive outlook over the bottom lands on both sides of the  canyon and above. The cove is about 40 feet deep, and, though so high  up, has been used as a sheep close, and doubtless some of the walls have  been covered up. Four rooms are still standing in two little clusters of  two rooms each. The walls of the rooms on the west are composed of large  stones laid in plenty of mud mortar and plastered inside and out; those  of the eastern portion were built of small stones, chinked but not  plastered. One of the rooms is blackened by smoke in the corner only, as  though there had been some chimney structure here, which subsequently  had fallen away. The cliff walls back of the eastern part are heavily  smoke-blackened; back of the western portion there are no stains. There  is now no trace of a circular kiva, but there is a heavy deposit of  sheep dung on the ground which might cover up such traces if they  existed. This site commands one of the best outlooks in the canyon, but  access, while not very difficult, is inconvenient on account of the  great height above the bottom.      [Illustration: Fig. 49--Plan of cliff room with partitions.]    Figure 49 shows a common type of ruin in this class. The original  structure appears to have contained one or two good rooms, which by  subsequent additions have been divided into several. These later  additions may have been made by the Navaho, who used the building  material on the ground; at any rate the structure is now merely a  cluster of storage cists.      [Illustration: Fig. 50--Plan of a large cliff outlook in Canyon del    Muerto.]    One of the most extensive ruins of the cliff-outlook type situated in  Canyon del Muerto is shown in figure 50. The plan shows at least eight  rooms stretched along the cliff at the top of the talus. Figure 51 shows  five rooms arranged in a cluster. One of these is still complete, the  walls extending to the overhanging rock above which formed the roof. It  will be noticed that the front room was set back far enough to allow  access to the central room through a doorway in the corner. This was a  convenience, rather than a necessity, for many of the rooms in ruins of  this class were entered only through other rooms or through the roof,  and a direct opening to the outer air was not considered a necessity;  probably because these rooms in the cliff, which have been termed  outlooks, were not in any sense watch towers, but rather places of abode  during the harvest season, where the workers in the field lived when not  actually employed in labor, and where the fields tinder cultivation  could always be kept in view--an arrangement quite as necessary and  quite as extensively practiced now as it was formerly.    Figure 52 shows a cluster of rooms in the little canyon called  Tseonitsosi. This is another Casa Blanca, or White House, and, oddly  enough, it resembles its namesake in De Chelly, not only in the coat of  whitewash applied to the front of the main room, but in having a  subordinate room to the left, over which the wash extends, and in the  character of the site it occupies. The principal part of the structure  was built in a cave, 18 or 20 feet from the ground, across the front of  which walls extended as in the other Casa Blanca, and, like that ruin,  there are also some ruins at the foot of the cliff, on the flat. Figure  53 is a ground plan. The resemblance to the other Casa Blanca, however,  goes no further. The ruin here illustrated represents a very small  settlement, hardly more than half a dozen rooms in all, and there is no  trace of a circular kiva, or other evidence of permanent habitation. It  is possible that the space between the edge of the floor of the cave  above and the whitened house back of it was occupied by some sort of  structure, but no evidence now remains which would warrant such a  hypothesis, except that the door of the white house is now about 4 feet  above the ground. The cave is only 40 feet long and a little over 10  feet deep, and there is not room on the floor for more than three or  four rooms, in addition to those shown on the plan. The room on the  right still preserves its roof intact, showing the typical pueblo roof  construction. It has a well-preserved doorway, and three other openings  may be seen in the main room.      [Illustration: Fig. 51--Plan of a cluster of rooms In Canyon del    Muerto.]      [Illustration: Fig. 52--White House ruin in Tseonitsosi canyon.]    Apparently some effort at ornamentation was made here. The whitewash was  not applied to the fronts of the two back rooms so as to cover all of  them, but in a broad belt, leaving the natural yellowish-gray color of  the plastering in a narrow band above and a broad band below it.  Moreover, the principal opening of the larger room was specially  treated; in the application of the whitewash a narrow border or frame of  the natural color was left surrounding it. The attempt to apply  decoration not utilitarian in character is rare among the ruins here. It  implies either a late period in the occupancy of this region, or an  occupancy of the site by a people who had practiced this method of  house-building longer or under more favorable conditions than the  others.      [Illustration: Fig. 53--Ground plan of a ruin in Tseonitsosi canyon.]      [Illustration: Fig. 54--Plan of rooms against a convex cliff.]      [Illustration: Fig. 55--Small ruin with curved wall.]    Figure 54 shows an arrangement of rooms along a narrow ledge at the top  of the talus, where the cliff wall is not coved or concave, but convex.  Some of these little rooms may have been used only for storage, but  others were undoubtedly habitations. Figure 55 shows an example in which  the back wall is curved, as though it was either built over an old kiva  or an attempt was made to convert a rectangular room into a kiva. There  were originally three rooms in the cluster, only one of which remains,  but that one is of unusual size, measuring about 15 by 10 feet. If the  room was used solely as a habitation, there was no necessity for the  back wall, as the side walls continue back to the cliff. Including the  little cove on the left, there are seven Navaho burial places on this  site.      [Illustration: Fig. 56--Ground plan of a cliff outlook.]    Plate LIII shows an outlook in the lower part of De Chelly, at the point  marked 6 on the map. The lower part of the cliff here flares out  slightly, forming a sharp slope; where it meets the vertical rock there  is a small bench, on which the ruin is situated. It is apparently  inaccessible, but close examination shows a long series of hand and foot  holes extending up a cleft in the rock, and forming an easy ascent. The  site commands a good outlook over the bottom lands.    The ruin consists of three rectangular rooms arranged side by side  against the cliff, and a kind of curved addition on the east. Figure 56  is a ground plan. The walls are still standing from a foot to 4 feet  high, and produce the impression of being unfinished; although carefully  chinked, they were neither plastered nor rubbed down. The two western  rooms were built first, and the eastern wall extends through the front.  East of these rooms there is a small rectangular chamber, and east of  this again a low curved wall forming a little chamber or cist of  irregular form (not shown in the plan). The front wall was extended  beyond this and brought in again to the cliff on a curve, forming  another small cist of irregular shape. This and the little chamber west  of it were doubtless used for storage. They resemble in plan Navaho  cists, but the masonry, which is exactly like the other walls here, will  not permit the hypothesis of Navaho construction. Except for some slight  traces in the northwest corner of the west room, there are no smoke  stains about, nor are there any pictographs on the cliff walls. The  western room was pierced by a window opening which was subsequently  filled up, possibly by the Navaho, who have five burial cists here.      [Illustration: Fig. 57--Plan of cliff outlook No. 14, in Canyon de    Chelly.]    Figure 57 is the plan of a small outlook which occurs at the point  marked 14 on the map.

For a while, at least,  until Evarin found out what had happened. I didn't deceive myself that I  could carry the impersonation through another meeting.    On the other hand, if I pressed the stud, the bird might turn on me. And  then all my troubles would be over for good.    If I delayed past Evarin's deadline, and did nothing, the other bird in  his keeping would hunt down Juli and give her a swift and not too  painless death.    I spent most of the day in a _chak_ dive, juggling plans. Toys, innocent  and sinister. Spies, messengers. Toys which killed horribly. Toys which  could be controlled, perhaps, by the pliant mind of a child, and every  child hates its parents now and again!    Even in the Terran colony, who was safe? In Mack's very home, one of the  Magnusson youngsters had a shiny thing which might, or might not, be one  of Evarin's hellish Toys. Or was I beginning to think like a  superstitious Dry-towner?    Damn it, Evarin couldn't be infallible; he hadn't even recognized me as  Race Cargill! Or--suddenly the sweat broke out, again, on my  forehead--_or had he_? Had the whole thing been one of those sinister,  deadly and incomprehensible nonhuman jokes?    I kept coming to the same conclusion. Juli was in danger, but she was  half a world away. Rakhal was here in Charin. There was a child  involved--Juli's child. The first step was to get inside the Terran  colony and see how the land lay.    Charin is a city shaped like a crescent moon, encircling the small Trade  City: a miniature spaceport, a miniature skyscraper HQ, the clustered  dwellings of the Terrans who worked there, and those who lived with them  and supplied them with necessities, services and luxuries.    Entry from one to the other is through a guarded gateway, since this is  hostile territory, and Charin lies far beyond the impress of ordinary  Terran law. But the gate stood wide-open, and the guards looked lax and  bored. They had shockers, but they didn't look as if they'd used them  lately.    One raised an eyebrow at his companion as I shambled up. I could pretty  well guess the impression I made, dirty, unkempt and stained with  nonhuman blood. I asked permission to go into the Terran Zone.    They asked my name and business, and I toyed with the notion of giving  the name of the man I was inadvertently impersonating. Then I decided  that if Rakhal had passed himself off as Race Cargill, he'd expect  exactly that. And he was also capable of the masterstroke of  impudence--putting out a pickup order, through Spaceforce, for his own  name!    So I gave the name we'd used from Shainsa to Charin, and tacked one of  the Secret Service passwords on the end of it. They looked at each other  again and one said, \"Rascar, eh? This is the guy, all right.\" He took me  into the little booth by the gate while the other used an intercom  device. Presently they took me along into the HQ building, and into an  office that said \"Legate.\"    I tried not to panic, but it wasn't easy! Evidently I'd walked square  into another trap. One guard asked me, \"All right, now, what exactly is  your business in the Trade City?\"    I'd hoped to locate Rakhal first. Now I knew I'd have no chance and at  all costs I must straighten out this matter of identity before it went  any further.    \"Put me straight through to Magnusson's office, Level 38 at Central HQ,  by visi,\" I demanded. I was trying to remember if Mack had ever even  heard the name we used in Shainsa. I decided I couldn't risk it. \"Name  of Race Cargill.\"    The guard grinned without moving. He said to his partner, \"That's the  one, all right.\" He put a hand on my shoulder, spinning me around.    \"Haul off, man. Shake your boots.\"    There were two of them, and Spaceforce guards aren't picked for their  good looks. Just the same, I gave a pretty good account of myself until  the inner door opened and a man came storming out.    \"What the devil is all this racket?\"    One guard got a hammerlock on me. \"This Dry-towner bum tried to talk us  into making a priority call to Magnusson, the Chief at Central. He knew  a couple of the S.S. passwords. That's what got him through the gate.  Remember, Cargill passed the word that somebody would turn up trying to  impersonate him.\"    \"I remember.\" The strange man's eyes were wary and cold.    \"You damned fools,\" I snarled. \"Magnusson will identify me! Can't you  realize you're dealing with an impostor?\"    One of the guards said to the legate in an undertone, \"Maybe we ought to  hold him as a suspicious character.\" But the legate shook his head. \"Not  worth the trouble. Cargill said it was a private affair. You might  search him, make sure he's not concealing contraband weapons,\" he added,  and talked softly to the wide-eyed clerk in the background while the  guards went through my shirtcloak and pockets.    When they started to unwrap the silk-shrouded Toy I yelled--if the thing  got set off accidentally, there'd be trouble. The legate turned and  rebuked, \"Can't you see it's embroidered with the Toad God? It's a  religious amulet of some sort, let it alone.\"    They grumbled, but gave it back to me, and the legate commanded, \"Don't  mess him up any more. Give him back his knife and take him to the gates.  But make sure he doesn't come back.\"    I found myself seized and frog-marched to the gate. One guard pushed my  skean back into its clasp. The other shoved me hard, and I stumbled,  fell sprawling in the dust of the cobbled street, to the accompaniment  of a profane statement about what I could expect if I came back. A  chorus of jeers from a cluster of _chak_ children and veiled women broke  across me.    I picked myself up, glowered so fiercely at the giggling spectators that  the laughter drained away into silence, and clenched my fists, half  inclined to turn back and bull my way through. Then I subsided. First  round to Rakhal. He had sprung the trap on me, very neatly.    The street was narrow and crooked, winding between doubled rows of  pebble-houses, and full of dark shadows even in the crimson noon. I  walked aimlessly, favoring the arm the guard had crushed. I was no  closer to settling things with Rakhal, and I had slammed at least one  gate behind me.    Why hadn't I had sense enough to walk up and demand to _see_ Race  Cargill? Why hadn't I insisted on a fingerprint check? I could prove my  identity, and Rakhal, using my name in my absence, to those who didn't  know me by sight, couldn't. I could at least have made him try. But he  had maneuvered it very cleverly, so I never had a chance to insist on  proofs.    I turned into a wineshop and ordered a dram of greenish mountainberry  liquor, sipping it slowly and fingering the few bills and coins in my  pockets. I'd better forget about warning Juli. I couldn't 'vise her from  Charin, except in the Terran zone. I had neither the money nor the time  to make the trip in person, even if I could get passage on a  Terran-dominated airline after today.    Miellyn. She had flirted with me, and like Dallisa, she might prove  vulnerable. It might be another trap, but I'd take the chance. At least  I could get hints about Evarin. And I needed information. I wasn't used  to this kind of intrigue any more. The smell of danger was foreign to me  now, and I found it unpleasant.    The small lump of the bird in my pocket tantalized me. I took it out  again. It was a temptation to press the stud and let it settle things,  or at least start them going, then and there.    After a while I noticed the proprietors of the shop staring at the silk  of the wrappings. They backed off, apprehensive. I held out a coin and  they shook their heads. \"You are welcome to the drink,\" one of them  said. \"All we have is at your service. Only please go. Go quickly.\"    They would not touch the coins I offered. I thrust the bird in my  pocket, swore and went. It was my second experience with being somehow  tabu, and I didn't like it.    It was dusk when I realized I was being followed.    At first it was a glimpse out of the corner of my eye, a head seen too  frequently for coincidence. It developed into a too-persistent footstep  in uneven rhythm.    Tap-_tap_-tap. Tap-_tap_-tap.    I had my skean handy, but I had a hunch this wasn't anything I could  settle with a skean. I ducked into a side street and waited.    Nothing.    I went on, laughing at my imagined fears.    Then, after a time, the soft, persistent footfall thudded behind me  again.    I cut across a thieves market, dodging from stall to stall, cursed by  old women selling hot fried goldfish, women in striped veils railing at  me in their chiming talk when I brushed their rolled rugs with hasty  feet. Far behind I heard the familiar uneven hurry: tap-_tap_-tap,  tap-_tap_-tap.    I fled down a street where women sat on flower-decked balconies, their  open lanterns flowing with fountains and rivulets of gold and orange  fire. I raced through quiet streets where furred children crept to doors  and watched me pass with great golden eyes that shone in the dark.    I dodged into an alley and lay there, breathing hard. Someone not two  inches away said, \"Are you one of us, brother?\"    I muttered something surly, in his dialect, and a hand, reassuringly  human, closed on my elbow. \"This way.\"    Out of breath with long running, I let him lead me, meaning to break  away after a few steps, apologize for mistaken identity and vanish, when  a sound at the end of the street made me jerk stiff and listen.    Tap-_tap_-tap. Tap-_tap_-tap.    I let my arm relax in the hand that guided me, flung a fold of my  shirtcloak over my face, and went along with my unknown guide.          CHAPTER THIRTEEN      I stumbled over steps, took a jolting stride downward, and found myself  in a dim room jammed with dark figures, human and nonhuman.    The figures swayed in the darkness, chanting in a dialect not altogether  familiar to me, a monotonous wailing chant, with a"]]]
