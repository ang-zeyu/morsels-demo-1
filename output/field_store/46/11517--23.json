You don't say so,\" interrupted the good woman. \"And I  worriting all day lest they should take you in. What was it? Ten  pounds--fifteen--sure it _can't_ be twenty!\"    Jack held out the beans triumphantly.    \"There,\" he said. \"That's what I got for her, and a jolly good bargain  too!\"    It was his mother's turn to be flabbergasted; but all she said was:    \"What! Them beans!\"    \"Yes,\" replied Jack, beginning to doubt his own wisdom; \"but they're  _magic_ beans. If you plant them over-night, by morning  they--grow--right up--into--the--sky--Oh! Please don't hit so hard!\"    For Jack's mother for once had lost her temper, and was belabouring the  boy for all she was worth. And when she had finished scolding and  beating, she flung the miserable beans out of window and sent him,  supperless, to bed.    If this was the magical effect of the beans, thought Jack ruefully, he  didn't want any more magic, if you please.    However, being healthy and, as a rule, happy, he soon fell asleep and  slept like a top.    When he woke he thought at first it was moonlight, for everything in the  room showed greenish. Then he stared at the little window. It was  covered as if with a curtain by leaves. He was out of bed in a trice,  and the next moment, without waiting to dress, was climbing up the  biggest beanstalk you ever saw. For what the queer little old man had  said was true! One of the beans which his mother had chucked into the  garden had found soil, taken root, and grown in the night....    Where?...    Up to the very sky? Jack meant to see at any rate.    So he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed. It was easy work, for the  big beanstalk with the leaves growing out of each side was like a  ladder; for all that he soon was out of breath. Then he got his second  wind, and was just beginning to wonder if he had a third when he saw in  front of him a wide, shining white road stretching away, and away, and  away.    So he took to walking, and he walked, and walked, and walked, till he  came to a tall, shining white house with a wide white doorstep.    And on the doorstep stood a great big woman with a black porridge-pot  in her hand. Now Jack, having had no supper, was hungry as a hunter, and  when he saw the porridge-pot he said quite politely:    \"Good-morning, 'm. I wonder if you _could_ give me some breakfast?\"    \"Breakfast!\" echoed the woman, who, in truth, was an ogre's wife. \"If it  is breakfast you're wanting, it's breakfast you'll likely be; for I  expect my man home every instant, and there is nothing he likes better  for breakfast than a boy--a fat boy grilled on toast.\"    Now Jack was not a bit of a coward, and when he wanted a thing he  generally got it, so he said cheerful-like:    \"I'd be fatter if I'd had my breakfast!\" Whereat the ogre's wife laughed  and bade Jack come in; for she was not, really, half as bad as she  looked. But he had hardly finished the great bowl of porridge and milk  she gave him when the whole house began to tremble and quake. It was the  ogre coming home!                         Thump! THUMP!! THUMP!!!    \"Into the oven with you, sharp!\" cried the ogre's wife; and the iron  oven door was just closed when the ogre strode in. Jack could see him  through the little peep-hole slide at the top where the steam came out.    He was a big one for sure. He had three sheep strung to his belt, and  these he threw down on the table. \"Here, wife,\" he cried, \"roast me  these snippets for breakfast; they are all I've been able to get this  morning, worse luck! I hope the oven's hot?\" And he went to touch the  handle, while Jack burst out all of a sweat, wondering what would happen  next.    \"Roast!\" echoed the ogre's wife. \"Pooh! the little things would dry to  cinders. Better boil them.\"    So she set to work to boil them; but the ogre began sniffing about the  room. \"They don't smell--mutton meat,\" he growled. Then he frowned  horribly and began the real ogre's rhyme:      \"_Fee-fi-fo-fum,     I smell the blood of an Englishman.     Be he alive, or be he dead,     I'll grind his bones to make my bread._\"    \"Don't be silly!\" said his wife. \"It's the bones of the little boy you  had for supper that I'm boiling down for soup! Come, eat your breakfast,  there's a good ogre!\"    So the ogre ate his three sheep, and when he had done he went to a big  oaken chest and took out three big bags of golden pieces. These he put  on the table, and began to count their contents while his wife cleared  away the breakfast things. And by and by his head began to nod, and at  last he began to snore, and snored so loud that the whole house shook.    Then Jack nipped out of the oven and, seizing one of the bags of gold,  crept away, and ran along the straight, wide, shining white road as fast  as his legs would carry him till he came to the beanstalk. He couldn't  climb down it with the bag of gold, it was so heavy, so he just flung  his burden down first, and, helter-skelter, climbed after it.    And when he came to the bottom, there was his mother picking up gold  pieces out of the garden as fast as she could; for, of course, the bag  had burst.    \"Laws-a-mercy me!\" she says. \"Wherever have you been? See! It's been  rainin' gold!\"    \"No, it hasn't,\" began Jack. \"I climbed up--\"    Then he turned to look for the beanstalk; but, lo and behold! it wasn't  there at all! So he knew, then, it was all real magic.    After that they lived happily on the gold pieces for a long time, and  the bed-ridden father got all sorts of nice things to eat; but, at last,  a day came when Jack's mother showed a doleful face as she put a big  yellow sovereign into Jack's hand and bade him be careful marketing,  because there was not one more in the coffer. After that they must  starve.    That night Jack went supperless to bed of his own accord. If he couldn't  make money, he thought, at any rate he could eat less money. It was a  shame for a big boy to stuff himself and bring no grist to the mill.    He slept like a top, as boys do when they don't overeat themselves, and  when he woke....    Hey, presto! the whole room showed greenish, and there was a curtain of  leaves over the window! Another bean had grown in the night, and Jack  was up it like a lamp-lighter before you could say knife.    This time he didn't take nearly so long climbing until he reached the  straight, wide, white road, and in a trice he found himself before the  tall white house, where on the wide white steps the ogre's wife was  standing with the black porridge-pot in her hand.    And this time Jack was as bold as brass. \"Good-morning, 'm,\" he said.  \"I've come to ask you for breakfast, for I had no supper, and I'm as  hungry as a hunter.\"    \"Go away, bad boy!\" replied the ogre's wife. \"Last time I gave a boy  breakfast my man missed a whole bag of gold. I believe you are the same  boy.\"    \"Maybe I am, maybe I'm not,\" said Jack, with a laugh. \"I'll tell you  true when I've had my breakfast; but not till then.\"    So the ogre's wife, who was dreadfully curious, gave him a big bowl full  of porridge; but before he had half finished it he heard the ogre  coming--                        Thump! THUMP! THUMP!    \"In with you to the oven,\" shrieked the ogre's wife. \"You shall tell me  when he has gone to sleep.\"    This time Jack saw through the steam peep-hole that the ogre had three  fat calves strung to his belt.    \"Better luck to-day, wife!\" he cried, and his voice shook the house.  \"Quick! Roast these trifles for my breakfast! I hope the oven's hot?\"    And he went to feel the handle of the door, but his wife cried out  sharply:    \"Roast! Why, you'd have to wait hours before they were done! I'll broil  them--see how bright the fire is!\"    \"Umph!\" growled the ogre. And then he began sniffing and calling out:      \"_Fee-fi-fo-fum,     I smell the blood of an Englishman.     Be he alive, or be he dead,     I'll grind his bones to make my bread._\"    \"Twaddle!\" said the ogre's wife. \"It's only the bones of the boy you had  last week that I've put into the pig-bucket!\"    \"Umph!\" said the ogre harshly; but he ate the broiled calves, and then  he said to his wife, \"Bring me my hen that lays the magic eggs. I want  to see gold.\"    So the ogre's wife brought him a great big black hen with a shiny red  comb. She plumped it down on the table and took away the breakfast  things.    Then the ogre said to the hen, \"Lay!\" and it promptly laid--what do you  think?--a beautiful, shiny, yellow, golden egg!    \"None so dusty, henny-penny,\" laughed the ogre. \"I shan't have to beg as  long as I've got you.\" Then he said, \"Lay!\" once more; and, lo and  behold! there was another beautiful, shiny, yellow, golden egg!    Jack could hardly believe his eyes, and made up his mind that he would  have that hen, come what might. So, when the ogre began to doze, he just  out like a flash from the oven, seized the hen, and ran for his life!  But, you see, he reckoned without his prize; for hens, you know, always  cackle when they leave their nests after laying an egg, and this one set  up such a scrawing that it woke the ogre.    \"Where's my hen?\" he shouted, and his wife came rushing in, and they  both rushed to the door; but Jack had got the better of them by a good  start, and all they could see was a little figure right away down the  wide white road, holding a big, scrawing, cackling, fluttering black hen  by the legs!    How Jack got down the beanstalk he never knew. It was all wings, and  leaves, and feathers, and cacklings; but get down he did, and there was  his mother wondering if the sky was going to fall!    But the very moment Jack touched ground he called out, \"Lay!\" and the  black hen ceased cackling and laid a great, big, shiny, yellow, golden  egg.    So every one was satisfied; and from that moment everybody had  everything that money could buy."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17071"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: Scotland (#18)"],[1,"she  is fed or supported; but her dress is aye whole, her cottage ever smokes,  and her table lacks neither of wine, white and red, nor of fowl and fish,  and white bread and brown.  It was a dear scoff to Jock Matheson, when he  called old Moll the uncanny carline of Blawhooly: his boat ran round and  round in the centre of the Solway--everybody said it was enchanted--and  down it went head foremost; and hadna Jock been a swimmer equal to a  sheldrake, he would have fed the fish.  But I'll warrant it sobered the  lad's speech; and he never reckoned himself safe till he made old Moll  the present of a new kirtle and a stone of cheese.\"    \"O father!\" said his granddaughter Barbara, \"ye surely wrong poor old  Mary Moray; what use could it be to an old woman like her, who has no  wrongs to redress, no malice to work out against mankind, and nothing to  seek of enjoyment save a canny hour and a quiet grave--what use could the  fellowship of fiends and the communion of evil spirits be to her?  I know  Jenny Primrose puts rowan-tree above the door-head when she sees old Mary  coming; I know the good-wife of Kittlenaket wears rowan-berry leaves in  the headband of her blue kirtle, and all for the sake of averting the  unsonsie glance of Mary's right ee; and I know that the auld Laird of  Burntroutwater drives his seven cows to their pasture with a wand of  witch-tree, to keep Mary from milking them.  But what has all that to do  with haunted shallops, visionary mariners, and bottomless boats?  I have  heard myself as pleasant a tale about the Haunted Ships and their  unworldly crews as any one would wish to hear in a winter evening.  It  was told me by young Benjie Macharg, one summer night, sitting on  Arbigland-bank: the lad intended a sort of love meeting; but all that he  could talk of was about smearing sheep and shearing sheep, and of the  wife which the Norway elves of the Haunted Ships made for his uncle  Sandie Macharg.  And I shall tell ye the tale as the honest lad told it  to me.    \"Alexander Macharg, besides being the laird of three acres of peatmoss,  two kale gardens, and the owner of seven good milch cows, a pair of  horses, and six pet sheep, was the husband of one of the handsomest women  in seven parishes.  Many a lad sighed the day he was brided; and a  Nithsdale laird and two Annandale moorland farmers drank themselves to  their last linen, as well as their last shilling, through sorrow for her  loss.  But married was the dame; and home she was carried, to bear rule  over her home and her husband, as an honest woman should.  Now ye maun  ken that though the flesh-and-blood lovers of Alexander's bonnie wife all  ceased to love and to sue her after she became another's, there were  certain admirers who did not consider their claim at all abated, or their  hopes lessened by the kirk's famous obstacle of matrimony.  Ye have heard  how the devout minister of Tinwald had a fair son carried away, and  wedded against his liking to an unchristened bride, whom the elves and  the fairies provided; ye have heard how the bonnie bride of the drunken  Laird of Soukitup was stolen by the fairies out at the back-window of the  bridal chamber, the time the bridegroom was groping his way to the  chamber door; and ye have heard--but why need I multiply cases?  Such  things in the ancient days were as common as candle-light.  So ye'll no  hinder certain water elves and sea fairies, who sometimes keep festival  and summer mirth in these old haunted hulks, from falling in love with  the weel-faured wife of Laird Macharg; and to their plots and  contrivances they went how they might accomplish to sunder man and wife;  and sundering such a man and such a wife was like sundering the green  leaf from the summer, or the fragrance from the flower.    \"So it fell on a time that Laird Macharg took his halve-net on his back,  and his steel spear in his hand, and down to Blawhooly Bay gaed he, and  into the water he went right between the two haunted hulks, and placing  his net awaited the coming of the tide.  The night, ye maun ken, was  mirk, and the wind lowne, and the singing of the increasing waters among  the shells and the peebles was heard for sundry miles.  All at once light  began to glance and twinkle on board the two Haunted Ships from every  hole and seam, and presently the sound as of a hatchet employed in  squaring timber echoed far and wide.  But if the toil of these unearthly  workmen amazed the laird, how much more was his amazement increased when  a sharp shrill voice called out, 'Ho, brother! what are you doing now?'  A  voice still shriller responded from the other haunted ship, 'I'm making a  wife to Sandie Macharg!'  And a loud quavering laugh running from ship to  ship, and from bank to bank, told the joy they expected from their  labour.    \"Now the laird, besides being a devout and a God-fearing man, was shrewd  and bold; and in plot and contrivance, and skill in conducting his  designs, was fairly an overmatch for any dozen land elves; but the water  elves are far more subtle; besides their haunts and their dwellings being  in the great deep, pursuit and detection is hopeless if they succeed in  carrying their prey to the waves.  But ye shall hear.  Home flew the  laird, collected his family around the hearth, spoke of the signs and the  sins of the times, and talked of mortification and prayer for averting  calamity; and, finally, taking his father's Bible, brass clasps, black  print, and covered with calf-skin, from the shelf, he proceeded without  let or stint to perform domestic worship.  I should have told ye that he  bolted and locked the door, shut up all inlet to the house, threw salt  into the fire, and proceeded in every way like a man skilful in guarding  against the plots of fairies and fiends.  His wife looked on all this  with wonder; but she saw something in her husband's looks that hindered  her from intruding either question or advice, and a wise woman was she.    \"Near the mid-hour of the night the rush of a horse's feet was heard, and  the sound of a rider leaping from its back, and a heavy knock came to the  door, accompanied by a voice, saying, 'The cummer drink's hot, and the  knave bairn is expected at Laird Laurie's to-night; sae mount, good-wife,  and come.'    \"'Preserve me!' said the wife of Sandie Macharg, 'that's news indeed; who  could have thought it?  The laird has been heirless for seventeen years!  Now, Sandie, my man, fetch me my skirt and hood.'    \"But he laid his arm round his wife's neck, and said, 'If all the lairds  in Galloway go heirless, over this door threshold shall you not stir to-  night; and I have said, and I have sworn it; seek not to know why or  wherefore--but, Lord, send us thy blessed mornlight.'  The wife looked  for a moment in her husband's eyes, and desisted from further entreaty.    \"'But let us send a civil message to the gossips, Sandy; and hadna ye  better say I am sair laid with a sudden sickness? though it's sinful-like  to send the poor messenger a mile agate with a lie in his mouth without a  glass of brandy.'    \"'To such a messenger, and to those who sent him, no apology is needed,'  said the austere laird; 'so let him depart.'  And the clatter of a  horse's hoofs was heard, and the muttered imprecations of its rider on  the churlish treatment he had experienced.    \"'Now, Sandie, my lad,' said his wife, laying an arm particularly white  and round about his neck as she spoke, 'are you not a queer man and a  stern?  I have been your wedded wife now these three years; and, beside  my dower, have brought you three as bonnie bairns as ever smiled aneath a  summer sun.  O man, you a douce man, and fitter to be an elder than even  Willie Greer himself, I have the minister's ain word for 't, to put on  these hard-hearted looks, and gang waving your arms that way, as if ye  said, \"I winna take the counsel of sic a hempie as you;\" I'm your ain  leal wife, and will and maun have an explanation.'    \"To all this Sandie Macharg replied, 'It is written, \"Wives, obey your  husbands\"; but we have been stayed in our devotion, so let us pray;' and  down he knelt: his wife knelt also, for she was as devout as bonnie; and  beside them knelt their household, and all lights were extinguished.    \"'Now this beats a',' muttered his wife to herself; 'however, I shall be  obedient for a time; but if I dinna ken what all this is for before the  morn by sunket-time, my tongue is nae langer a tongue, nor my hands worth  wearing.'    \"The voice of her husband in prayer interrupted this mental soliloquy;  and ardently did he beseech to be preserved from the wiles of the fiends  and the snares of Satan; from witches, ghosts, goblins, elves, fairies,  spunkies, and water-kelpies; from the spectre shallop of Solway; from  spirits visible and invisible; from the Haunted Ships and their unearthly  tenants; from maritime spirits that plotted against godly men, and fell  in love with their wives--'    \"'Nay, but His presence be near us!' said his wife, in a low tone of  dismay.  'God guide my gudeman's wits: I never heard such a prayer from  human lips before.  But, Sandie, my man, Lord's sake, rise.  What fearful  light is this?  Barn and byre and stable maun be in a blaze; and Hawkie,  and Hurley, Doddie, and Cherrie, and Damsonplum will be smoored with  reek, and scorched with flame.'    \"And a flood of light, but not so gross as a common fire, which ascended  to heaven and filled all the court before the house, amply justified the  good-wife's suspicions.  But to the terrors of fire Sandie was as  immovable as he was to the imaginary groans of the barren wife of Laird  Laurie; and he held his wife, and threatened the weight of his right  hand--and it was a heavy one--to all who ventured abroad, or even  unbolted the door.  The neighing and prancing of horses, and the  bellowing of cows, augmented the horrors of the night; and to any one who  only heard the"]]]
