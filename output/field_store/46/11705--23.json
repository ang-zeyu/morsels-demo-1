SCARLET LAKE    Is prepared in the form of drops from cochineal, and is of a fine  transparent red colour and excellent body, though, like other lakes, it  dries slowly. Discoloured and destroyed by strong light both in water  and oil, and not permanent in tint with white lead or in combination  with other pigments, it possesses the common attributes of cochineal  lakes. Yet when well prepared, used in sufficient body, and not unduly  exposed, it has been found to last a lengthened period; but it ought  never to be employed in glazing, nor at all in works that aim at high  reputation and stability. It is in general tinted with vermilion, which  has probably been mixed with lakes at all times to give their scarlet  hue and add to their weight; for upon examining with a powerful lens  some fine pictures of ancient masters, in which lake had been used in  glazing, particles of vermilion were apparent, from which lake had  evidently flown. Unfortunately, these lakes are injured by vermilion as  they are by lead, so that glazings of cochineal over vermilion or lead  are particularly apt to vanish. This effect is very remarkable in  several pictures of Cuyp, where he has introduced a figure in red from  which the shadows have disappeared, owing to their having been formed  with lake over vermilion. The scarlet hue of this lake should properly  be imparted to it during the process of manufacture, and not by  subsequent mechanical admixture.    72. PURPLE LAKE    Is a species of crimson lake with a purple cast, transparent and  deep-toned, and useful in shadows: in other respects resembling that  pigment. Red being its predominant colour, we have preferred classing  this so-called purple among the reds, in spite of its name. On the whole  it is more durable than crimson lake.    73. FLORENTINE LAKE    Differs from scarlet lake only in the mode of preparation. Formerly the  lake so called was extracted from the shreds of scarlet cloth. The same  may be said of _Chinese Lake_.    74. HAMBURGH LAKE    Is a lake of great power and depth of colour, purplish or inclining to  crimson, which dries with extreme difficulty, but differs in no other  essential respect from preceding cochineal lakes--an observation which  applies to _Roman Lake_, _Venetian Lake_, and many others; none of  which, however beautiful or reputed, is entitled to the character of  stability either in hue, shade, or tint.    75. DRAGON'S BLOOD    Is a resin brought from the East Indies. It is of a warm  semi-transparent, rather dull red colour, which is deepened by impure  air, and darkened by light. There are two or three sorts, but that in  drops is the best. White lead soon destroys it, and in oil it dries with  extreme difficulty. It is sometimes used to colour varnishes and  lackers, being soluble in oils and alcohol. Although it has been  recommended as a pigment, dragon's blood does not merit the attention of  the artist.    76. INDIAN LAKE,    Likewise called _Lac Lake_. This is obtained from the lac or lacca of  India, a resinous secretion which seems to depend upon the puncture of a  small insect--_coccus ficus_--made for the sake of depositing its ova on  the branches of several plants, found in Siam, Assam, and Bengal. The  twigs soon become encrusted with a mammelated substance of a red colour  more or less deep, nearly transparent, hard, and having a brilliant  conchoidal fracture. The roughly-prepared coating is imported in two  forms, called lac-lake and lac-dye, which contain about 50 per cent of  colouring matter, combined with more or less resin, and with earthy  matters, consisting chiefly of carbonate and sulphate of lime and  silica.    Indian lake is rich, transparent, and deep,--less brilliant and more  durable than the colours of cochineal, but inferior in both respects to  those of madder. Used thickly or in strong glazing, as a shadow colour,  it is of great body and much permanence; but in thin glazing it changes  and flies, as it also does in tint with white lead. In the properties of  drying, &c., it resembles other lakes. The pigment may be dispensed with  in favour of madder lake and madder brown, whose combinations serve for  every purpose to which it can be applied, and are stable.    Lac appears to be the lake which has stood best in old pictures, and was  probably employed by the Venetians, who had the trade of India when  painting flourished at Venice.      MADDER LAKES.    _Rubric Lakes_, or _Field's Lakes_, are derived from the root of \"rubia  tinctorum,\" a plant largely grown in France and Holland, whence the bulk  of that used in England is obtained. The French madders are in a state  of very fine powder, containing one half their weight of gum, sugar,  salts, and other soluble substances, which water speedily dissolves.  Madder roots in the unground state are imported from the Levant, and  called Turkey roots. Good qualities of Turkey madder yield near sixty  per cent of extractive matters, a term that includes everything  removable by water and dilute alkalis: the woody fibre is therefore  about forty per cent. This is presuming the root to be genuine, for  madder is often adulterated with brickdust, red ochre, red sand, clay,  mahogany sawdust, logwood, sandal and japan-wood, and bran.    Unlike cochineal, madder possesses several colouring matters; the  question of which, despite the learned researches of Dr. Schunck and  others, is far from settled yet. The following remarks embody our own  experience of the root, simply as a pigment-producing product:--    Madder contains five colouring matters--yellow, red, orange, purple, and  brown. Of these, the first colour is soluble in cold water. By washing  the powdered root quickly with it by decantation, the yellow and brown  are extracted in the form of an opaque liquid. If this be decanted and  allowed to stand, the brown deposits, leaving a clear buffish-yellow  supernatant liquor. In the root from which the extract was poured, the  remaining three colours are left. On adding a strong boiling solution of  alum, these are dissolved, yielding a fine red liquid. From this there  can be thrown down, by the agency of different chemicals, a red, an  orange, or a purple precipitate. Or, supposing the whole of the  colouring matter to be deposited as a red lake, it is possible to  convert this--also by the agency of different chemicals--either into  orange or purple. Hence, for all practical purposes, madder contains but  three colouring matters: a yellow, soluble in cold water; a brown, not  soluble in, but capable of being extracted by cold water; and a red,  soluble in boiling alum, and furnishing at will a purple or an orange.    As was observed in the previous chapter, no good pigment is obtained  from the yellow, of which the less there is present the better; but the  brown affords a valued product, which will be duly noticed. It is  essential to the purity of the reds, that the madder should be freed  from both these colours; and it was probably due to insufficient aqueous  washing of the root, that the old lakes were dull and muddy, mere  brick-reds of ochrous hues. For many years, however, lakes have been  prepared perfectly transparent, and literally as beautiful and pure in  colour as the rose; qualities in which they are unrivalled by the lakes  and carmine of cochineal. They have justly been considered as supplying  a desideratum, and as among the most valuable acquisitions of the  palette in modern times, since permanent transparent red and rose  pigments were previously unknown. The red varieties range from rich  crimson to a delicate rose, and are known as _Madder Carmine_, _Field's  Carmine_, _Pink Madder_, _Rose Madder_, _Madder Lake_, and _Liquid  Rubiate_ or _Liquid Madder Lake_.    77. MADDER CARMINE,    Or _Field's Carmine_, like that of cochineal, is the richest and deepest  lake prepared, containing most colouring matter and least base. It  differs from the paler products chiefly in transparency and intensity,  and is the only durable carmine for painting either in water or oil; for  both which it is qualified by texture without previous grinding. In  common with the other reds of madder, its faint washes possess greater  clearness than those of cochineal. This carmine is a difficult colour to  make well, exceeding care and nicety being required to obtain the  fullest tint: hence it is apt to vary in hue according to the skill of  the manufacturer. Being expensive also, the price increasing according  to depth of colour, the lake has been the most liable to adulteration,  of all the reds of madder. Mérimée states that samples were sent to him  from Berlin, under the name of \"carmine madder,\" which evidently owed  their brightness to tincture of cochineal. It is certain that madder  lakes have been imitated on the Continent with various success by those  of lac, cochineal, and carthamus or safflower. The best we have seen is  the _laque de garance_, which was tinged with the rouge of carthamus,  and was of course inferior in durability. As, however, liquid ammonia  and alkalis generally dissolve the colours of cochineal, lac, and  safflower, the test is simple. If the liquid remain uncoloured on  adding ammonia to an assumed madder lake, in all probability the pigment  is genuine.    78. ROSE MADDER.    The exquisite flowers of Bartholomew, Miss Mutrie, and others, give  evidence of the beauty, purity, and stability of the reds of madder,  both in water and oil. This variety, less intense than the preceding and  without its carmine hue, is of a rich rose colour--a true rose--tending  neither to crimson, scarlet, nor purple. Marked by a peculiar softness,  and an unusual clearness in its pale washes, rose madder affords the  most perfect carnation tints known. Not liable to change by the action  of light, impure air, or admixture with white lead and other colours, it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#18)"],[1,"herself was the person  who superintended the preparation of the viands in the kitchen. So the  female slaves brought to them the viands, and the sweetmeats, and the  fruits; and she ate with her family. But afterward they said to her: \"O  Gulnare, thy master is a man who is a stranger to us, and we have  entered his abode without his permission, and thou praisest to us his  excellence, and hast also brought to us his food, and we have eaten, but  have not seen him, nor hath he seen us, nor come into our presence, nor  eaten with us, that the bond of bread and salt might be established  between us.\" And they all desisted from eating, and were enraged at her,  and fire began to issue from their mouths as from cressets. So when the  king beheld this, his reason fled, in consequence of the violence of his  fear of them. Then Gulnare rose to them, and soothed their hearts; after  which she walked along until she entered the closet in which was the  king her master; and she said to him: \"O my master, didst thou see, and  didst thou hear my thanks to thee, and my praise of thee in the presence  of my family; and didst thou hear what they said to me, that they  desired to take me with them to our family and our country?\" The king  answered her: \"I heard and saw. May God recompense thee! By Allah, I  knew not the extent of the love that thou feelest for me until this  blessed hour.\" She replied: \"O my master, is the recompense of  beneficence aught but beneficence? How then could my heart be happy to  quit thee, and to depart from thee? Now I desire of thy goodness that  thou come and salute my family, that they may see thee, and that  pleasure and mutual friendship may ensue. For know, O King, that my  brother and my mother and the daughters of my uncle have conceived a  great love for thee in consequence of my praising thee to them, and they  have said, 'We will not depart from thee to our country until we have an  interview with the king, and salute him.'\" And the king said to her: \"I  hear and obey; for this is what I desire.\" He then rose from his place,  and went to them, and saluted them with the best salutation; and they  hastened to rise to him; they met him in the most polite manner, and he  sat with them in the pavilion, ate with them at the table, and remained  with them for a period of thirty days. Then they desired to return to  their country and abode. So they took leave of the king and Queen  Gulnare of the Sea, and departed from them, after the king had treated  them with the utmost honour.    After this, Gulnare gave birth to a boy, resembling the moon at the  full, whereat the king experienced the utmost happiness, because he had  not before been blessed with a son nor a daughter during his life. They  continued the rejoicings, and the decoration of the city, for a period  of seven days, in the utmost happiness and enjoyment; and on the seventh  day, the mother of Gulnare, and her brother, and the daughters of her  uncle, all came, when they knew that she had given birth to her child.  The king met them, rejoicing at their arrival, and said to them: \"I said  that I would not name my son until ye should come, and that ye should  name him according to your knowledge.\" And they named him Bedr Basim  (_Smiling Full Moon_), all of them agreeing as to this name. They then  presented the boy to his maternal uncle, Saleh, who took him upon his  hands, and, rising with him from among them, walked about the palace to  the right and left; after which he went forth with him from the palace,  descended with him to the sea, and walked on until he became concealed  from the eye of the king. So when the king saw that he had taken his  son, and disappeared from him at the bottom of the sea, he despaired of  him, and began to weep and wail. But Gulnare, seeing him in this state,  said to him, \"O King of the age, fear not nor grieve for thy son; for I  love my child more than thou, and my child is with my brother; therefore  fear not his being drowned. If my brother knew that any injury would  betide the little one, he had not done what he hath done; and presently  he will bring thee thy son safe, if it be the will of God, whose name be  exalted!\" And but a short time had elapsed when the sea was agitated,  and the uncle of the little one came forth from it, having with him the  king's son safe, and he flew from the sea until he came to them, with  the little one in his arms, silent, and his face resembling the moon in  the night of its fulness. Then the uncle of the little one looked toward  the king, and said to him: \"Perhaps thou fearedst some injury to thy son  when I descended into the sea, having him with me.\" So he replied: \"Yes,  O my master, I feared for him, and I did not imagine that he would ever  come forth from it safe.\" And Saleh said to him: \"O King of the Land, we  applied to his eyes a lotion that we know, and repeated over him the  names engraved upon the seal of Solomon, the son of David; for when a  child is born among us, we do to him as I have told thee. Fear not  therefore, on his account, drowning, nor suffocation, nor all the seas  if he descend into them. Like as ye walk upon the land, we walk in the  sea.\"    He then took forth from his pocket a case, written upon, and sealed; and  he broke its seal, and scattered its contents, whereupon there fell from  it strung jewels, consisting of all kinds of jacinths and other gems,  together with three hundred oblong emeralds, and three hundred oblong  large jewels, of the size of the eggs of the ostrich, the light of which  was more resplendent than the light of the sun and the moon. And he  said: \"O King of the age, these jewels and jacinths are a present from  me unto thee; for we never brought thee a present, because we knew not  the place of Gulnare's abode. So when we saw thee to have become united  to her, and that we all had become one, we brought thee this present;  and after every period of a few days, we will bring thee the like of it.  For these jewels and jacinths with us are more plentiful than the gravel  upon the land, and we know the excellent among them, and the bad, and  the places where they are found, and they are easy of access to  us.\"--And when the king looked at those jewels, his reason was  confounded and his mind was bewildered, and he said: \"By Allah, one of  these jewels is worth my kingdom!\" Then the king thanked Saleh of the  Sea for his generosity, and looking toward the Queen Gulnare said to  her: \"I am abashed at thy brother; for he hath shewn favour to me, and  presented me with this magnificent present, which the people of the  earth would fail to procure.\" So Gulnare thanked her brother for that  which he had done; but her brother said: \"O King of the age, to thank  thee hath been incumbent on us; for thou hast treated my sister with  beneficence, and we have entered thine abode, and eaten of thy  provision.\" Then Saleh said: \"If we stood serving thee, O King of the  age, a thousand years, regarding nothing else, we could not requite  thee, and our doing so would be but a small thing in comparison with thy  desert.\" And Saleh remained with the king, he and his mother and the  daughters of his uncle, forty days; after which he arose and kissed the  ground before the king, the husband of his sister. So the king said to  him: \"What dost thou desire, O Saleh?\" And he answered: \"O King of the  age, we desire of thy goodness that thou wouldst give us permission to  depart; for we have become desirous of seeing again our family and our  country and our relations and our homes. We will not, however,  relinquish the service of thee, nor that of my sister nor the son of my  sister; and by Allah, O King of the age, to quit you is not pleasant to  my heart; but how can we act, when we have been reared in the sea, and  the land is not agreeable to us?\" So when the king heard his words, he  rose upon his feet, and bade farewell to Saleh of the Sea and his mother  and the daughters of his uncle, and they wept together on account of the  separation. Then they said to the king: \"We will never relinquish you,  but after every period of a few days we will visit you.\" And after this,  they flew toward the sea, and descended into it, and disappeared.    The king treated Gulnare with beneficence, and honoured her exceedingly,  and the little one grew up well; and his maternal uncle, with his  grandmother and the daughters of his uncle, after every period of a few  days used to come to the residence of the king, and to remain with him a  month, and then return to their places. The boy ceased not to increase  in beauty and loveliness until his age became fifteen years; and he was  incomparable in his perfect beauty, and his stature and his justness of  form. He had learned writing and reading, and history and grammar and  philology, and archery; and he learned to play with the spear; and he  also learned horsemanship, and all that the sons of the kings required.  There was not one of the children of the inhabitants of the city, men  and women, that talked not of the charms of that young man; for he was  of surpassing loveliness and perfection; and the king loved him greatly.  Then the king summoned the vizier and the emeers, and the lords of the  empire, and the great men of the kingdom, and made them swear by binding  oaths that they would make Bedr Basim king over them after his father;  so they swore to him by binding oaths, and rejoiced thereat; and the  king himself was beneficent to the people, courteous in speech and of  auspicious aspect. And on the following day, the king mounted, together  with the lords of the empire and all the emeers, and all the soldiers,  and they ceased not to proceed until they arrived at the vestibule of  the palace; the king's son riding. Thereupon he alighted, and his father  embraced him, he and the emeers, and they seated him upon the throne of  the kingdom, while his father stood, as also"]]]
