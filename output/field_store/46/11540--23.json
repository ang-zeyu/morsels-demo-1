She was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. At  last Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when some one said, \"Come in,\"  they entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair before  the fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.    \"This is Miss Mary, sir,\" she said.    \"You can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you to  take her away,\" said Mr. Craven.    When she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a  plain little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see that  the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high,  rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white. He  turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her.    \"Come here!\" he said.    Mary went to him.    He was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been so  miserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and  as if he did not know what in the world to do with her.    \"Are you well?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" answered Mary.    \"Do they take good care of you?\"    \"Yes.\"    He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.    \"You are very thin,\" he said.    \"I am getting fatter,\" Mary answered in what she knew was her stiffest  way.    What an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely  saw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keep  his thoughts upon her.    \"I forgot you,\" he said. \"How could I remember you? I intended to send  you a governess or a nurse, or some one of that sort, but I forgot.\"    \"Please,\" began Mary. \"Please--\" and then the lump in her throat choked  her.    \"What do you want to say?\" he inquired.    \"I am--I am too big for a nurse,\" said Mary. \"And please--please don't  make me have a governess yet.\"    He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.    \"That was what the Sowerby woman said,\" he muttered absent-mindedly.    Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.    \"Is she--is she Martha's mother?\" she stammered.    \"Yes, I think so,\" he replied.    \"She knows about children,\" said Mary. \"She has twelve. She knows.\"    He seemed to rouse himself.    \"What do you want to do?\"    \"I want to play out of doors,\" Mary answered, hoping that her voice did  not tremble. \"I never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and I  am getting fatter.\"    He was watching her.    \"Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,\" he said. \"She  thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.\"    \"It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,\"  argued Mary.    \"Where do you play?\" he asked next.    \"Everywhere,\" gasped Mary. \"Martha's mother sent me a skipping-rope. I  skip and run--and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick  up out of the earth. I don't do any harm.\"    \"Don't look so frightened,\" he said in a worried voice. \"You could not  do any harm, a child like you! You may do what you like.\"    Mary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see  the excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer to  him.    \"May I?\" she said tremulously.    Her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.    \"Don't look so frightened,\" he exclaimed. \"Of course you may. I am your  guardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you time  or attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish you  to be happy and comfortable. I don't know anything about children, but  Mrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you to-day  because Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you. Her daughter had talked  about you. She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running  about.\"    \"She knows all about children,\" Mary said again in spite of herself.    \"She ought to,\" said Mr. Craven. \"I thought her rather bold to stop me  on the moor, but she said--Mrs. Craven had been kind to her.\" It seemed  hard for him to speak his dead wife's name. \"She is a respectable woman.  Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things. Play out of doors  as much as you like. It's a big place and you may go where you like and  amuse yourself as you like. Is there anything you want?\" as if a sudden  thought had struck him. \"Do you want toys, books, dolls?\"    \"Might I,\" quavered Mary, \"might I have a bit of earth?\"    In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound and  that they were not the ones she had meant to say. Mr. Craven looked  quite startled.    \"Earth!\" he repeated. \"What do you mean?\"    \"To plant seeds in--to make things grow--to see them come alive,\" Mary  faltered.    He gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his  eyes.    \"Do you--care about gardens so much,\" he said slowly.    \"I didn't know about them in India,\" said Mary. \"I was always ill and  tired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand and  stuck flowers in them. But here it is different.\"    Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.    \"A bit of earth,\" he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she  must have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to her  his dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.    \"You can have as much earth as you want,\" he said. \"You remind me of  some one else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you see a  bit of earth you want,\" with something like a smile, \"take it, child,  and make it come alive.\"    \"May I take it from anywhere--if it's not wanted?\"    \"Anywhere,\" he answered. \"There! You must go now, I am tired.\" He  touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. \"Good-by. I shall be away all  summer.\"    Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have been  waiting in the corridor.    \"Mrs. Medlock,\" Mr. Craven said to her, \"now I have seen the child I  understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She must be less delicate before she  begins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in the  garden. Don't look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh air  and romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then and  she may sometimes go to the cottage.\"    Mrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not  \"look after\" Mary too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and had  indeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she was  fond of Martha's mother.    \"Thank you, sir,\" she said. \"Susan Sowerby and me went to school  together and she's as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you'd find in  a day's walk. I never had any children myself and she's had twelve, and  there never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get no harm from  them. I'd always take Susan Sowerby's advice about children myself.  She's what you might call healthy-minded--if you understand me.\"    \"I understand,\" Mr. Craven answered. \"Take Miss Mary away now and send  Pitcher to me.\"    When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew back  to her room. She found Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact,  hurried back after she had removed the dinner service.    \"I can have my garden!\" cried Mary. \"I may have it where I like! I am  not going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming to  see me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me could  not do any harm and I may do what I like--anywhere!\"    \"Eh!\" said Martha delightedly, \"that was nice of him wasn't it?\"    \"Martha,\" said Mary solemnly, \"he is really a nice man, only his face is  so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.\"    She ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so much  longer than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would have to  set out early on his five-mile walk. When she slipped through the door  under the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him. The  gardening tools were laid together under a tree. She ran to them,  looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen. He had  gone away and the secret garden was empty--except for the robin who had  just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching  her.    \"He's gone,\" she said wofully. \"Oh! was he--was he--was he only a wood  fairy?\"    Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye. It  was a piece of paper--in fact, it was a piece of the letter she had  printed for Martha to send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with a  long thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there. There  were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture. At first  she could not tell what it was. Then she saw it was meant for a nest  with a bird sitting on it. Underneath were the printed letters and they  said:    \"I will cum bak.\"          CHAPTER XIII    \"I AM COLIN\"      Mary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and  she showed it to Martha.    \"Eh!\" said Martha with great pride. \"I never knew our Dickon was as  clever as that. That there's a picture of a missel thrush on her nest,  as large as life an' twice as natural.\"    Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had  meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was  her nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that  queer, common boy!    She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep  looking forward to the morning.    But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly  in the springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rain  beating with heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down in  torrents and the wind was \"wuthering\" round the corners and in the  chimneys of the huge old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable  and angry.    \"The rain is as contrary as I ever was,\" she said. \"It came because it  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#18)"],[1,"into the country, a-course we'll try and hold our tempers  down all we can. Miss Hallman, now--I don't suppose there's a man in the  bunch that would shoot her, no matter what she done to us. We take pride  in being polite to women. You've read that about us, haven't you, Miss  Allen? And you've seen us on the stage--well, it's a fact, all right.  Bad as we are, and wild and tough, and savage when we're crossed, a lady  can just do anything with us, if she goes at it the right way.\"    \"Thank you. I felt sure that you would not harm any of us. Will you  promise not to be violent--not to--to--\"    Andy sat sidewise in the saddle, so that he faced her. Miss Allen could  just make out his form distinctly; his face was quite hidden, except  that she could see the shine of his eyes.    \"Now, Miss Allen,\" he protested with soft apology \"You musta known what  to expect when you moved out amongst us rough characters. You know I can  make any promises about being mild with the men that try to get the best  of us. If you've got friends--brothers--anybody here that you think a  lot of Miss Allen, I advise you to send 'em outa the country, before  trouble breaks loose; because when she starts she'll start a-popping.  I know I can't answer for my self, what I'm liable to do if they bother  me; and I'm about the mildest one in the bunch. What the rest of the  boys would do--Irish Mallory for instance--I hate to think, Miss Allen.  I--hate--to--think!\"    Afterwards, when he thought it all over dispassionately, Andy  wondered why he had talked to Miss Allen like that. He had not done  it deliberately, just to frighten her--yet he had frightened her to a  certain extent. He had roused her apprehension for the safety of her  neighbors and the ultimate well-being of himself and his fellows. She  had been so anxious over winning him to more peaceful ways that she had  forgotten to give him any details of the coming struggle. Andy was sorry  for that. He wished, on the way home, that he knew just what Florence  Grace Hallman intended to do.    Not that it mattered greatly. Whatever she did, Andy felt that it would  be futile. The Happy Family were obeying the land laws implicitly,  except as their real incentive had been an unselfish one. He could not  feel that it was wrong to try and save the Flying U; was not loyalty a  virtue? And was not the taking of land for the preservation of a fine,  fair dealing outfit that had made itself a power for prosperity and  happiness in that country, a perfectly laudable enterprise? Andy  believed so.    Even though they did, down in their deepest thoughts, think of the  Flying U's interest, Andy did not believe that Florence Grace Hallman or  anyone else could produce any evidence that would justify a contest for  their land. Though they planned among themselves for the good of  the Flying U, they were obeying the law and the dictates of their  range-conscience and their personal ideas of right and justice and  loyalty to their friends and to themselves. They were not conspiring  against the general prosperity of the country in the hope of great  personal gain. When you came to that, they were saving fifty men from  bitter disappointment--counting one settler to every eighty acres, as  the Syndicate apparently did.    Still, Andy wondered why he had represented himself and his friends to  be such bloodthirsty devils. He grinned wickedly over some of the things  he had said, and over her womanly perturbation and pleading that they  would spare the lives of their enemies. Oh, well--if she repeated half  to Florence Grace Hallman, that lady would maybe think twice before she  tackled the contract of boosting the Happy Family off their claims. So  at the last he managed to justify his lying to her. He liked Miss Allen.  He was pleased to think that at least she would not forget him the  minute he was out of her sight.    He went to sleep worrying, not over the trouble which Florence Grace  Hallman might be plotting to bring upon him, but about Miss Allen's  given name and her previous condition of servitude. He hoped that she  was not a stenographer, and he hoped her first name was not Mary; and  if you know the history of Andy Green you will remember that he had a  reason for disliking both the name and the vocation.        CHAPTER 11. A MOVING CHAPTER IN EVENTS    Having nothing more than a general warning of trouble ahead to disturb  him, Andy rode blithely back down the coulee and met the herd just after  sunrise. Dreams of Miss Allen had left a pleasant mood behind them,  though the dreams themselves withdrew behind the veil of forgetfulness  when he awoke. He wondered what her first name was. He wondered how far  Irish's acquaintance with her had progressed, but he did not worry much  about Irish. Having represented himself to be an exceedingly dangerous  man, and having permitted himself to be persuaded into promising  reform and a calm demeanor--for her sake--he felt tolerably sure of her  interest in him. He had heard that a woman loves best the taming of a  dangerous man, and he whistled and sang and smiled until the dust of the  coming herd met him full. Since he felt perfectly sure of the result, he  hoped that Florence Grace Hallman would start something, just so that he  might show Miss Allen how potent was her influence over a bad, bad man  who still has virtues worth nurturing carefully.    Weary, riding point on the loitering herd, grinned a wordless greeting.  Andy passed with a casual wave of his hand and took his place on the  left flank. From his face Weary guessed that all was well with the  claims, and the assurance served to lighten his spirits. Soon he heard  Andy singing at the top of his voice, and his own thoughts fell into  accord with the words of the ditty. He began to sing also, whenever  he knew the words. Farther back, Pink took it up, and then the others  joined in, until all unconsciously they had turned the monotonous drive  into a triumphal march.    \"They're a little bit rough I must confess, the most of them at least,\"  prompted Andy, starting on the second verse alone because the others  didn't know the song as well as he. He waited a second for them to join  him, and went on extolling the valor of all true cowboys:       \"But long's you do not cross their trail you can live with     them at peace.       \"But if you do they're sure to rule, the day you come to     their land,       \"For they'll follow you up and shoot it out, and do it man to     man.\"    \"Say, Weary! They tell me Florence Grace is sure hittin' the warpost!  Ain't yuh scared?\"    Weary shook his head and rode forward to ease the leaders into a narrow  gulch that would cut off a mile or so of the journey.    \"Taking 'em up One Man?\" called Pink, and got a nod for answer. There  was a lull in the singing while they shouted and swore at these stubborn  cows who would have tried to break back on the way to a clover patch,  until the gulch broadened into an arm of One Man Coulee itself. It was  all peaceful and easy and just as they had planned. The morning was cool  and the cattle contented. They were nearing their claims, and all that  would remain for them to do was the holding of their herd upon the  appointed grazing ground. So would the requirements of the law be  fulfilled and the machinations of the Syndicate be thwarted and the land  saved to the Flying U, all in one.    And then the leaders, climbing the hill at a point half a mile below  Andy's cabin, balked, snorted and swung back. Weary spurred up to push  them forward, and so did Andy and Pink. They rode up over the ridge  shouting and urging the reluctant cattle ahead, and came plump into the  very dooryard of a brand new shack. A man was standing in the doorway  watching the disturbance his presence had created; when he saw the three  riders come bulging up over the crest of the bluff, his eyes widened.    The three came to a stop before him, too astonished to do more than  stare. Once past the fancied menace of the new building and the man, the  cattle went trotting awkwardly across the level, their calves galloping  alongside.    \"Hello,\" said Weary at last, \"what do you think you're doing here?\"    \"Me? I'm holding down a claim. What are you doing?\" The man did not seem  antagonistic or friendly or even neutral toward them. He seemed to be  waiting. He eyed the cattle that kept coming, urged on by those who  shouted at them in the coulee below. He watched them spread out and go  trotting away after the leaders.    \"Say, when did yuh take this claim?\" Andy leaned negligently forward and  looked at him curiously.    \"Oh, a week or so ago. Why?\"    \"I just wondered. I took it up myself, four weeks ago. Four forties I've  got, strung out in a line that runs from here to yonder. You've got over  on my land--by mistake, of course. I just thought I'd tell yuh,\" he added  casually, straightening up, \"because I didn't think you knew it before.\"    \"Thanks.\" The man smiled one-sidedly and began filling a pipe while he  watched them.    \"A-course it won't be much trouble to move your shack,\" Andy continued  with neighborly interest. \"A wheelbarrow will take it, easy. Back here  on the bench a mile or so, yuh may find a patch of ground that nobody  claims.\"    \"Thanks.\" The man picked a match from his pocket and striking it on the  new yellow door-casing lighted his pipe.    Andy moved uneasily. He did not like that man, for all he appeared so  thankful for information. The fellow had a narrow forehead and broad,  high cheek bones and a predatory nose. His eyes were the wrong shade of  blue and the lids drooped too much at the outer corners. Andy studied  him curiously. Did the man know what he was up against, or did he not?  Was he sincere in his ready thanks, or was he sarcastic? The man looked  up at him then. His eyes were clean of any hidden meaning, but they  were the wrong shade of blue--the shade that is opaque and that you "]]]
