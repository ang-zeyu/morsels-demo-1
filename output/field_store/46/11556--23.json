The fishermen all think it is going to be an exceptional  gale. It is blowing dead on shore. It will be bad work for any ships  that happen to be coming up Channel today. Eight or ten of our boats  are out. We thought we had made out three of them just before you came,  but the cloud closed down on them. The fishermen are just going to get  lifelines ready. I am afraid we are going to have a terrible night of  it.\"    \"I came down to ask you if you will come up to lunch, Jim, but I  suppose you will not be able to tear yourself away from here.\"    \"I shouldn't like to leave now, indeed. There is no saying what may  happen. Besides, so many of the fishermen are away, that I may be  useful here if a vessel comes ashore, and there may be half a dozen  before the morning. Every hand will be wanted to give assistance.\"    \"But you could not get a boat out through those breakers, could you,  Jim?\"    \"Yes,\" Jim replied, \"we might get one of the big boats through it now;  but it's going to be worse, presently. When I went out, last year, with  a boat to the brig which was driven ashore, it was worse than this.    \"I shall be very glad to come up tomorrow, if you will let me. I hear  that fellow Horton went away last week.\"    \"Yes, he went away, Jim. But why his being there should have kept you  from going up is beyond me.\"    \"I don't like the fellow, Mr. Wilks. He may mean very well, but I don't  like him. I have been in one row about him with the squire, and I don't  want another; but I am quite sure, if I had gone up much while he was  there, it would have ended in my trying to punch his head again.\"    \"In that case, perhaps,\" the old soldier said, smiling, \"you were wise  to stay away, Jim. I don't like the lad myself. Still, punching his  head would not have been a desirable thing.\"    \"I am glad you don't like him,\" James said, warmly. \"Somehow I made up  my mind that you were all sure to like him, and I don't suppose the  idea made me like him any the better. He was just the free-and-easy  sort of fellow to get along well, and I was quite sure that Aggie would  not want me, when she had him to go about with her. I saw him drive  through in the pony carriage with her, two or three times, and it was  easy to see how thoroughly she was enjoying herself.\"    \"Well, it was your own fault, my boy. If you choose to sulk down here,  and never to go up to the Hall, you can't blame Aggie for letting  herself be amused by someone else.\"    \"Oh! I don't blame her,\" James said hastily. \"Of course, it is all  right that she should enjoy herself with her cousin. Only somehow, you  know, after being great friends with anyone, one doesn't like to see  someone else stepping into your place.\"    \"But as I have told you, over and over again, during the last three  years, Jim, you have willfully stepped out of your place. You know how  often I have asked you to come up, and how seldom you have come. You  have never shown Aggie that you have any wish to continue on the  footing of friendship, on which you stood towards each other when she  was at your mother's, and as you have chosen to throw her over, I don't  see why she shouldn't take to anyone else who takes pains to make  himself pleasant to her.\"    \"Oh! I don't blame her a bit, Mr. Wilks. How could you think such a  thing! I was very fond of little Aggie when she was at my mother's; but  of course, I was not ass enough to suppose that she was going trotting  about the country with me, when she once went up to the Hall as the  squire's granddaughter. Of course, the whole thing was changed.    \"Ah! Here comes the rain.\"    As he spoke, a sudden splash of rain struck them. It might have been  noticed coming across the water in a white line. With it came a gust of  wind, to which that which had already been blowing was a trifle. There  was no more talking, for nothing less than a shout could have been  heard above the roaring of the wind. It was scarcely possible to stand  against the fury of the squall, and they were driven across the road,  and took shelter at the corner of some houses, where the fishermen had  already retired.    The squall lasted but a few minutes, but was soon succeeded by another,  almost equally furious, and this seemed to increase in strength, until  the wind was blowing a perfect hurricane; but the fishermen now  struggled across the road again, for, between the rain squalls, a  glimpse had been caught of two of the fishing boats, and these were now  approaching the shore. A mere rag of sail was set on each, and yet they  tore over the waves at tremendous speed.    One was some two hundred yards ahead of the other, and by the course  they were making, they would come ashore nearly at the same spot. The  news that two boats were in sight spread rapidly, and many of the  fishermen's wives, with shawls over their heads, ran down and stood  peering out from behind shelter, for it was well-nigh impossible to  stand exposed to the fury of the gale.    An old fisherman stood, with a coil of rope in his hand, close to the  water's edge. Several of the others stood close to him, and four of  them had hold of the other end of the rope. When the boat was within  fifty yards of shore, the sail was lowered; but she still drove  straight on before the wind, with scarce an abatement in her speed. A  man stood in her bow, also with a coil of rope in his hand, and, as he  approached, threw it far ahead. The fisherman rushed waist deep into  the water and caught the end of it, which in a moment was knotted to  the one in his hand.    \"Run along with her,\" he shouted.    For a moment, the boat towered on the top of a wave, which raced in  towards the shore. The next, as it came, took her stern, and she was in  the act of swinging round, when the strain of the rope came upon her,  and brought her straight again. Higher and higher the wave rose, and  then crashed down, and the boat shot forward, like an arrow, in the  foam. The fishermen rushed forward and caught it, those on board leapt  out waist-deep; all were taken off their feet by the backward rush, but  they clung to the sides of the boat, while the men at the head rope,  with their heels dug deeply into the sand, withstood the strain, and  kept her from being swept out again.    A few seconds, and the boat was left dry, and the next wave carried it  high up on the beach, amid a loud cheer from the fishermen and lookers  on; but there was no time to waste, for the next boat was close at  hand. Again, the rope was thrown to the shore, but this time the strain  came a moment too late, the following wave turned the boat round, the  next struck it broadside and rolled it, over and over, towards the  shore. The fishermen, in an instant, joined hands, and rushing down  into the water, strove to grasp the men.    Several times, those in front were knocked down and rolled up on the  beach, but three of the crew were brought in with them. There was one  still missing, and there was a shout as he was seen, clinging to an  oar, just outside the line of breakers. James Walsham had been working  with the fishermen in saving those already brought to shore. He now  fastened the end of a line round his body.    \"You can never get through those rollers--they will break you up like  an eggshell,\" the old fisherman shouted.    \"I will dive through them,\" Jim shouted back. \"Give me plenty of slack,  and don't pull, till you see I have got him.\"    The lad waited for his opportunity, and then, rushing down after the  sheet of white foam, he stood, waist deep, as a great wave, some twelve  feet high, towered up like a wall towards him. It was just going to  break, when James plunged, head foremost, into it. There was a crash  which shook the earth, a mass of wildly rushing foam, and then, some  ten yards beyond the spot where the wave had broken, Jim's head  appeared above the surface. It was but for a moment, for he immediately  dived again, under the next wave, and then came up within a few yards  of the floating oar. A stroke or two, and he was alongside. He seized  the man, and held up one arm as a signal. In a moment the rope  tightened, and they moved towards shore. When they were close to the  edge of the breaking waves, Jim held up his hand, and the strain  stopped.    \"Now,\" he said to the man, \"the moment they begin to pull, leave go of  the oar, and throw your arms round me.\"    He waited until a wave, bigger than ordinary, approached, and, just as  it began to pass under him, gave the signal. Higher and higher they  seemed to rise, then they were dashed down with a tremendous shock.  There was a moment's confusion as they were swept along in the white  water. Jim felt a terrific strain, and it seemed to him that the rope  would cut him in sunder. Then he was seized by a dozen strong arms, and  carried high and dry, before the next wave could reach him.    For a minute or two he was scarce conscious. The breath had been almost  knocked out of his body, with the break of the wave, and the rushing  water seemed still singing in his ears.    \"Are you hurt, my boy? Are you hurt, James?\" were the first words he  clearly heard.    \"No, I think I am all right,\" he said, trying to sit up. \"Is the other  fellow all right?\"    \"He has broke his arm,\" one of the fishermen, who had just helped the  man to his feet, replied. \"He may be thankful it's no worse.\"    James was now helped to his feet.    \"I am all right,\" he repeated to Mr. Wilks, \"except that I feel as if I  had a hot iron round my body. That rope has taken the skin off all  round me, I fancy, and doesn't it smart, just, with the salt water!\"    \"Oh, James, how could you do it?\" a girl's voice said suddenly.    The fishermen drew aside, and Aggie Linthorne pressed forward.    The squire had gone into her schoolroom and had said:    \"Mrs. Walsham, I think you had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#18)"],[1,"a  piece of work overnight while Pierre went off to his brandies. But  this was Christmas eve, and he was very tired. Even the scent of the  sandalwood could not make him fancy he was warm. The world seemed to  be a black place, full of suffering and despair.    \"In all the world, I have no friend,\" said Hyacinthe, staring at the  flame of the lamp. \"In all the world, there is no one to care whether  I live or die. In all the world, no place, no heart, no love. O kind  God, is there a place, a love for me in another world?\"    I hope you feel very sorry for Hyacinthe, lonely, and cold, and shut  up in the workshop on the eve of Christmas. He was but an overgrown,  unhappy child. And I think with old Madame that for unhappy children,  at this season, no help seems too divine for faith.    \"There is no one to care for me,\" said Hyacinthe. And he even looked  at the chisel in his hand, thinking that by a touch of that he might  lose it all, and be at peace, somewhere, not far from God. Only it was  forbidden. Then came the tears, and great sobs that shook him, so that  he scarcely heard the gentle rattling of the latch.    He stumbled to the door, opening it on the still woods and the frosty  stars. And a lad who stood outside in the snow said, \"I see you are  working late, comrade. May I come in?\"    Hyacinthe brushed his ragged sleeve across his eyes and nodded \"Yes.\"  Those little villages strung along the great river see strange  wayfarers at times. And Hyacinthe said to himself that surely here was  such a one. Blinking into the stranger's eyes, he lost for a flash the  first impression of youth, and received one of incredible age or  sadness. But the wanderer's eyes were only quiet, very quiet, like  the little pools in the wood where the wild does went to drink. As he  turned within the door, smiling at Hyacinthe and shaking some snow  from his cap, he did not seem to be more than sixteen or so.    \"It is very cold outside,\" he said. \"There is a big oak tree on the  edge of the fields that had split in the frost and frightened all the  little squirrels asleep there. Next year it will make an even better  home for them. And see what I found close by!\" He opened his fingers  and showed Hyacinthe a little sparrow lying unruffled in the palm.    \"_Pauvrette!_\" said the dull Hyacinthe. \"_Pauvrette!_ Is it then  dead?\" He touched it with a gentle forefinger.    \"No,\" answered the strange boy, \"it is not dead. We will put it here  among the shavings, not far from the lamp, and it will be well by the  morning.\"    He smiled at Hyacinthe again, and the shambling lad felt dimly as if  the scent of the sandalwood were sweeter, and the lamp-flame clearer.  But the stranger's eyes were only quiet, quiet.    \"Have you come far?\" asked Hyacinthe. \"It is a bad season for  traveling, and the wolves are out.\"    \"A long way,\" said the other. \"A long, long way. I heard a child  cry--\"    \"There is no child here,\" put in Hyacinthe. \"Monsieur L'Oreillard says  children cost too much money. But if you have come far, you must need  food and fire, and I have neither. At the Cinq Chateaux you will find  both.\"    The stranger looked at him again with those quiet eyes, and Hyacinthe  fancied that his face was familiar. \"I will stay here,\" he said; \"you  are late at work, and you are unhappy.\"    \"Why as to that,\" answered Hyacinthe, rubbing his cheeks and ashamed  of his tears, \"most of are sad at one time or another, the good God  knows. Stay here and welcome if it pleases you; and you may take a  share of my bed, though it is no more than a pile of balsam boughs and  an old blanket in the loft. But I must work at this cabinet, for the  drawers must be finished and the handles put on and the corners  carved, all by the holy morning; or my wages will be paid with a  stick.\"    \"You have a hard master,\" put in the other, \"if he would pay you with  blows upon the feast of Noel.\"    \"He is hard enough,\" said Hyacinthe, \"but once he gave me a dinner of  sausages and white wine; and once, in the summer, melons. If my eyes  will stay open, I will finish this by morning. Stay with me an hour or  so, comrade, and talk to me of your travels, so that the time may pass  more quickly.\"    And while Hyacinthe worked, he told,--of sunshine and dust, of the  shadow of vine-leaves on the flat white walls of a house; of rosy  doves on the roof; of the flowers that come out in the spring,  anemones crimson and blue, and white cyclamen in the shadow of the  rocks; of the olive, the myrtle, and the almond; until Hyacinthe's  fingers ceased working, and his sleepy eyes blinked wonderingly.    \"See what you have done, comrade,\" he said at last; \"you have told me  of such pretty things that I have done but little work for an hour.  And now the cabinet will never be finished, and I shall be beaten.\"    \"Let me help you,\" smiled the other. \"I also was bred a carpenter.\"    At first Hyacinthe would not, fearing to trust the sweet wood out of  his own hands. But at length he allowed the stranger to fit in one of  the drawers. And so deftly was it done that Hyacinthe pounded his  fists on the bench in admiration. \"You have a pretty knack,\" he cried.  \"It seemed as if you did but hold the drawer in your hands a moment,  and hey! it jumped into its place.\"    \"Let me fit in the other little drawers while you rest awhile,\" said  the stranger. So Hyacinthe curled up among the shavings, and the other  boy fell to work upon the little cabinet of sandalwood.    Hyacinthe was very tired. He lay still among the shavings, and thought  of all the boy had told him, of the hillside flowers, the laughing  leaves, the golden bloom of the anise, and the golden sun upon the  roads until he was warm. And all the time the boy with the quiet eyes  was at work upon the cabinet, smoothing, fitting, polishing.    \"You do better work than I,\" said Hyacinthe once, and the stranger  answered, \"I was lovingly taught.\" And again Hyacinthe said, \"It is  growing towards morning. In a little while I will get up and help  you.\"    \"Lie still and rest,\" said the other boy. And Hyacinthe lay still. His  thoughts began to slide into dreams, and he woke with a little start,  for there seemed to be music in the shed; though he could not tell  whether it came from the strange boy's lips, or from the shappy tools  as he used them, or from the stars.    \"The stars are much paler,\" thought Hyacinthe. \"Soon it will be  morning, and the corners are not carved yet. I must get up and help  this kind one in a little moment. Only the music and the sweetness  seem to fold me close, so that I may not move.\"    Then behind the forest there shone a pale glow of dawn, and in  Terminaison the church bells began to ring. \"Day will soon be here,\"  thought Hyacinthe, \"and with day will come Monsieur L'Oreillard and  his stick. I must get up and help for even yet the corners are not  carved.\"    But the stranger looked at him, smiling as though he loved him, and  laid his brown finger lightly on the four empty corners of the  cabinet. And Hyacinthe saw the squares of reddish wood ripple and  heave and break, as little clouds when the wind goes through the sky.  And out of them thrust forth the little birds, and after them the  lilies, for a moment living; but even as Hyacinthe looked, settling  back into the sweet reddish-brown wood. Then the stranger smiled  again, laid all the tools in order, and, opening the door, went away  into the woods.    Hyacinthe crept slowly to the door. The winter sun, half risen, filled  all the frosty air with splendid gold. Far down the road a figure  seemed to move amid the glory, but the splendor was such that  Hyacinthe was blinded. His breath came sharply as the glow beat on the  wretched shed, on the old shavings, on the cabinet with the little  birds and the lilies carved at the corners.    He was too pure of heart to feel afraid. But \"Blessed be the Lord,\"  whispered Hyacinthe, clasping his slow hands, \"for He hath visited and  redeemed His people. But who will believe?\"    Then the sun of Christ's day rose gloriously, and the little sparrow  came from his nest among the shavings and shook his wings to the  light.

Stocking      You have all heard of the shepherds who went to Bethlehem, but I do  not believe any of you have heard of the shepherd who didn't go. The  Bible does not say anything about him, but his story has come to me,  and I am going to tell it to you.    The city of Bethlehem stood on a hill. Below the town, with its steep  narrow streets and white walls, were gray olive orchards. Below the  orchards were gardens bright with flowers. Below the gardens lay green  meadows, and beyond these pasture-lands that stretched away to the  wilderness plains where little patches of grass grew among the bushes  and between the great rocks. There were caves among these rocks where  wolves used to skulk and sometimes robbers hid. So the shepherds who  guarded their flocks in these wild pastures dared not leave them  alone.    One clear beautiful night, many centuries ago, four shepherds were  watching their flocks on these pastures. Samuel, Ezra, Joel, and  Dahvid were their names. Samuel, Ezra, and Joel were strong men, no  longer young, with shaggy eyebrows and brown beards; Ezra's was short,  Joel's long, and Samuel's streaked with gray. They owned the flocks  which they tended. Dahvid was a boy with ruddy cheeks, bright eyes,  and strong lithe limbs. He cared for the flocks of old Abraham.  Abraham was old and rich, and did not work any more, but hired  Dahvid, whose family was very poor, to care for his sheep.    The flocks of the four shepherds were lying quiet on the plain far  below the city, and near by Samuel, Ezra, Joel, and Dahvid lay wrapped  in their shepherds' cloaks.    \"Samuel,\" said Dahvid, rising upon his elbow.    \"What is it, Dahvid?"]]]
