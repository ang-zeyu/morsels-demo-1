At a banquet in Brandenburg  the 5th of March, 1890, speaking of his many voyages, he said: \"He  who, alone at sea, standing on the bridge, with nothing over him but  God's heaven, has communed with himself will not mistake the value of  such voyages. I could wish for many of my countrymen that they might  live through similar hours of self-contemplation, where a man takes  stock of what he has tried to do, and of what he has accomplished.  Then it is that a man is cured of vanity, and we have all of us need  of that.\"    It is obvious that a man cannot be modest, as the above quotation  would indicate, and at the same time preening with vanity; a Sir  Philip Sidney and a Jew peddler; a careless, dashing cavalry officer  or proud Prussian squire, and at the same time a wary and astute  insurance agent for the empire; a preacher of duty and honor, and  belief in God, and at the same time a political comedian deceiving his  rivals abroad, and hoodwinking his subjects at home.    Not a few men, even of slight powers of observation and of meagre  experience, have noted the strange fact that a blank and direct  statement of the truth is very apt to be put down as a lie; and that a  man who frankly expresses his beliefs and ambitions, and openly goes  about his business and his pleasures with no thought of concealment,  is often regarded as Machiavellian and deceitful, because a timid and  cautious world finds it hard to believe that he is really as audacious  as he appears.    Even those with the most limited list, of the great names of history  at their disposal, cannot fail to remember that simplicity and  directness have in the persons of their highest exemplars been  misunderstood; hunted down like wild beasts, burned, crucified, and  then, when they were well out of the way, crowned and held up to  humanity as the saviors of the race. We will have none of them when  authority, faith, truth, courage, show us our distorted images in the  mirror of their lives. Crucify him, crucify him! has always been the  cry when such a one asserts his moral kingship, or his sonship to God,  or his audacious intention to live his own life; and in less tragic  fashion, but none the less along the same lines, the world tends to  pick at, and to fray the moral garments of, its leaders still to-day.  When such a one succeeds through sheer simplicity, then that last  feeble epitaph of mediocrity is applied to him: \"He is lucky,\" because  so few people realize that \"luck,\" is merely not to be dependent upon  luck.    It is apparent from the quotations I have given, and many more of the  same tenor are at our disposal, that the personality we are studying  has a very definite image of his place in the world, of the duties he  is called upon to perform, of his rights according to his own  conception of his authority and responsibilities, and of his  intentions.    It is equally apparent that he looks upon history in quite another way  than that usually accepted by the modern scientific historian. Taine  and Green may explain everything, even kings and emperors, by the  forces of climate, environment, and the slow-heaving influence of the  people. This school of historians will tell you how Charlemagne, and  Luther, and Cromwell, and Napoleon are to be accounted for by purely  material explanations.    The German Emperor apparently believes that the history of the world  and the development of mankind are due to a series of mighty factors,  mysteriously endowed from on high and bearing the names of men, and  not infrequently the names of emperors and kings. He is continually  recalling his ancestors, the Great Elector, Frederick the Great, and  William I, his grandfather. These men made Prussia and Prussia made  the German Empire, he declares. To the Brandenburg Parliament he says:  \"It is the great merit of my ancestors that they have always stood  aloof from and above all parties, and that they have always succeeded  in making political parties combine for the welfare of the whole  people.\"    Due to a quality in the German character that need not be discussed  here, it is true that they have been led, and driven, and welded by  powerful individuals. No Magna Charta, no Cromwell, no Declaration of  Independence is to be found in German history. No vigorous demand from  the people themselves marks their progress. You can read all there is  of German history in the biographies of the Great Elector, of  Frederick William the First, of Frederick the Great, of York, of von  Stein, Hardenberg, Sharnhorst, and Bluecher, of Bismarck, William I,  and the present Emperor.    What the Kaiser believes of history is true of German history. If he  asserts himself as he does in Germany, it is because two hundred and  fifty years of German history put him wholly and entirely in the  right. It is to be presumed that what every student of German history  may see for himself, has not escaped the flexible intelligence of the  present Emperor, and that is, that only the autocratic kings of  Prussia succeeded, and that only an autocratic statesman succeeded, in  bringing the whole country into line, by the acknowledgment of the  King of Prussia, and his heirs forever, as German emperors.    The first so-called indiscretion of the present Emperor was  magnificent. He dismissed Bismarck two years after he came to the  throne. If you have ever been the owner of a yacht and your sailing-master  has grown to be a tyrant, and you have taken your courage in  your hand and bundled him over the side, you have had in a microcosmic  way the sensations of such an experience.    It is said that Bismarck, then seventy-five years old, and since 1862  accustomed to undisputed power, demurred to the wish of the Emperor  that the other ministers should have access to him directly, and not  as heretofore only through the chancellor. It is said too that the  matter-of-fact and somewhat cynical Bismarck, had but scanty respect  for the mystical view of his grandfather as a saint, that the Emperor  everywhere proclaimed. In 1896, the 20th of February, in speaking of  his grandfather, he refers to him as: \"The Emperor William, that  personality which has become for us in some sort that of a saint.\"    Bismarck, too, objected to the Emperor's policy as regards the  treatment of, and the legislation for, the workingmen. On February the  5th, 1890, he writes to Bismarck: \"It is the duty of the state to  regulate the duration and conditions of work in such manner that the  health and the morality of the workingman may be preserved, and that  his needs may be satisfied and his desire for equality before the law  assured.\"    \"Now this is the tale of the Council the German  Kaiser decreed,    \"And the young king said:--'I have found it,  the road to the rest ye seek:    The strong shall wait for the weary, and the  hale shall halt for the weak;    With the even tramp of an army where no man  breaks from the line,    Ye shall march to peace and plenty, in the  bond of brotherhood--sign!'\"    Whatever the reasons, the criticisms, or the causes, the man whom we  have been describing was as certain to dismiss Bismarck from office,  as a bird is certain to fly and not to swim. The ruler who at a  banquet May the 4th, 1891, proclaimed: \"There is only one master of  the nation: and that is I, and I will not abide any other\"; and later,  on the 16th of November, in an address to recruits said: \"I need  Christian soldiers, soldiers who say their Pater Noster. The soldier  should not have a will of his own, but you should all have but one  will and that is my will; there is but one law for you and that is  mine.\" Again, in addressing the recruits for the navy on the 5th of  March, 1895, he said to them: \"Just as I, as Emperor and ruler,  consecrate my life and my strength to the service of the nation, so  you are pledged to give your lives to me.\" Such a man could not share  his rule with Bismarck.    Bismarck left Berlin amid groans and tears. A prop had been rudely  pushed from beneath the empire. The young Emperor would stumble and  sway, and fall without this strong guide beside him. Men said this was  the first sign of an imperious will and temper.    There is an Arab proverb which runs: \"When God wishes to destroy an  ant he gives it wings.\" The Kaiser was to be given power for his own  destruction. But what has happened? Absolutely nothing of these evil  prophecies. In 1884 Bismarck was saying to Gerhard Rohlfs, the African  explorer: \"The main thing is, we neither can nor really want to  colonize. We shall never have a fleet like France. Our artisans and  lawyers and time-expired soldiers are no good as colonists.\" If the  ideas of William the Second were to prevail, it was time that Bismarck  went over the side as pilot of the ship of state. The Kaiser in  appropriate terms regretted the loss of this tried public servant and  said: \"However, the course remains the same-- full steam ahead!\"    Three days after the Jameson raid, on the 3d of January, 1896, the  Kaiser telegraphed to President Krueger: \"I beg to express to you my  sincere congratulations that, without help from foreign powers, you  have succeeded with your own people and by your own strength in  driving out the armed bands which attempted to disturb the peace of  your country, and in reestablishing order and in defending the  independence of your people from attacks from outside.\"    On the 28th of October, 1908, The Daily Telegraph of London published  a long interview with the Emperor, the gist of which was that the  British press and people continued to distrust him, while all the time  he was and had been the friend of Great Britain. The Emperor cited  instances of his friendship, declared the English were as mad as March  hares not to believe in him; insisted that by reason of Germany's  increasing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#18)"],[1," bas-relief of the Lower  Chamber of the Temple of the Tigers at Chichen Itza. It seems clearly to  designate the figure in much the same way as figures are named in the  Mexican writings, _i.e._, by having a glyph showing this nearby.  Attention has already been called to the fact that here at Chichen Itza,  and, especially on this bas-relief, there is much which shows a strong  influence from the north. The two figures in Tro-Cortesianus 43a are  probably bears. Foerstemann (1902, p. 68) considers that they are men  masked as _Chacs_ or _Bacabs_.    LEAF-NOSED BAT (_Vampyrus spectrum_; _Artibeus jamaicensis_; or  _Phyllostomus hastatus panamensis_). Several remarkably diabolical  representations of bats (Maya, _so[c]_, usually written _zotz_) occur  among the Maya remains. These all show the prominent nose leaf  distinguishing the family _Phyllostomatidae_ and, as the Mayas probably  used the largest and most conspicuous of the native species for artistic  representation, it is likely that some one of the three species above  mentioned is the one here shown.    [Illustration: FIGS. 11, 12, 13, 14.  GLYPHS FOR MAYA MONTH ZOTZ (BATS).]    The bat had a place in the Maya pantheon. One of the months of the Maya  year (_Zotz_) was named after this animal and the glyph for this month  shows the characteristic nasal appendage. This is to be seen more  clearly in the glyphs selected from the stone inscriptions (Pl. 38,  figs. 1, 2, 4-6) than in those from the codices (text figs. 11-14)  although the nose leaf is still visible in the latter. The day sign  _Akbal_ (night) occurs as the eye in the figures from the manuscripts. A  carving showing the whole body of the bat is used as a glyph in Stela D  from Copan (Pl. 38, fig. 3). This may also represent the Bat god who is  associated with the underworld, \"the god of the caverns.\" This god is  pictured on the \"Vase of Chama\" (Pl. 38, fig. 7) figured by Dieseldorff  (1904, pp. 665-666) and by Gordon (1898, Pl. III). Seler (1904a) has  discussed the presence of this god among the Mayas, the Zapotecs, and  the Nahuas. The bat does not seem to occur in the Maya manuscripts as a  god, although there are glyphs which seem to refer to this god (Dresden  17b), as pointed out by Seler, when there is no other representation of  this deity.    No doubt in the times of the Maya civilization, these bats haunted the  temples by day as they do now, and thus became readily endowed with a  religious significance.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.  POTTERY WHISTLE, APE. FROM ULOA VALLEY, HONDURAS.]    CAPUCHIN MONKEY (_Cebus capucinus,--C. hypoleucus_ Auct.)[TN-10] With the  possible exception of one or two figures, monkeys (Maya, _maa[vs]_ or  _baa[c]_) are not represented in the Maya codices examined. In  Tro-Cortesianus 88c (Pl. 39, fig. 4) occurs a curious nondescript animal  with what seem to be hoofs on the forefeet, a somewhat bushy tail of  moderate length, and a head that appears to be distinctly bonneted,  somewhat as in the representations of the capuchin. Stempell regards  this as a monkey, though recognizing that the short bushy tail is unlike  that of any Central American species. The figure seems quite as likely a  peccary or possibly a combination of a deer with some other animal. A  glyph (Pl. 39, fig. 5) found directly above the figure just referred  to, suggests a monkey, though it cannot be surely identified. A pottery  whistle from the Uloa Valley (text fig. 15) shows two monkeys standing  side by side with a posterior extension for the mouth piece. Their heads  are shaped as in other representations of this monkey with a distinct  cap or bonnet and facial discs. A pottery stamp from the same locality  shows a monkey with a long tail (Gordon, 1898, Pl. 11, fig. f). It  recalls the drawings of monkeys given by Strebel (1899, Pls. 1-4).    In the Nuttall Codex are numerous heads and a few other figures of a  monkey, which from the erect hair of the crown, curling tail, and  distinctly indicated facial area must be the common bonneted or capuchin  monkey of Central America. This species does not occur in Yucatan. What  is undoubtedly the same animal is shown as a head glyph in Pl. 39, fig.  8, from the Aubin manuscript. The identifications of the head-forming  glyphs in the Nuttall and the Aubin manuscripts are certainly correct as  the Nahua day sign (_Ocomatli_) means ape.    [Illustration: FIGS. 16, 17, 18, 19.  GLYPHS FOR MAYA DAY CHUEN.]    Text figs. 16-19, show some of the signs for the day _Chuen_ from the  Maya codices. This is the day corresponding to the day Ocomatli of the  Nahuas. There is little resembling an ape in the Maya signs although it  has been remarked that the sign may show the open jaws and teeth of this  animal.    Foerstemann (1897) as noted by Schellhas (1904, p. 21) alludes to the  fact that the figure of god C, which occurs also in the sign for the  north, in the _tonalamatl_ in Dresden 4a-10a occurs in the day _Chuen_  of the Maya calendar, and this corresponds to the day _Ocomatli_, the  ape, in the Nahua calendar. This would suggest a connection between god  C and the ape and this may be seen in the glyphs for god C (text figs.  20-24). Foerstemann sees \"an ape whose lateral nasal cavity (peculiar to  the American ape or monkey) is occasionally represented plainly in the  hieroglyph picture.\" He also associates god C with the constellation of  Ursa Minor.    [Illustration: FIGS. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.  GLYPHS OF GOD C.]    It will be seen from the detailed examination of the fauna shown in the  codices that after all a comparatively small part of the animal life of  the country occupied by the Maya speaking peoples is represented. The  drawings in some cases are fairly accurate, so that there is little  difficulty in determining the species intended by the artist. At other  times, it is hazardous to state the exact species to which the animal  belongs. It is only in a comparatively small number of cases, however,  that there is any great doubt attached to the identification. It will be  noted that the drawings of the Dresden manuscript are much more  carefully and accurately done than those of the Tro-Cortesianus. A  greater delicacy and a more minute regard for detail characterize the  Dresden drawings in general.    In the animals selected for reproduction by the Mayas, only those were  taken which were used either in a purely religious significance for  their mythological character (and here naturally there is to be noted an  anthropomorphic tendency) or animals were chosen which were employed as  offerings to the many different gods of the Maya pantheon. The religious  character of the whole portrayal of animal life in the codices is  clearly manifest, and it is this side of the subject which will come out  more clearly as the manuscripts are better known.
