And here  and there, gliding among them, were what seemed little angel-fish  like living rainbows, whose filmy wing-like fins changed color when  they swam.    \"Klara reached into the water and tried to catch some of these  marvelous beings.    \"But at her first motion--bing! The water looked as if it were  streaked with rainbow lightning. Swish! It was dull and clear again,  with nothing between her and the quiet, seaweed-covered bottom.    \"A little farther along Klara came across a wonderful sea-grotto.  Again she knelt down on the Wake of Gold and watched. At the bottom  the sand was so white and shiny that it might have been made of  star-dust. Growing up from it were beds of marvelous seaflowers,  opening and shutting delicate petals, beautiful seafans that waved  with every ripple, high, thick shrubs and towering trees in which  the fishes had built their nests. In and out among all this  undergrowth, frisked tiny sea-horses, ridden by mischievous  sea-urchins. They leaped and trotted and galloped as if they were so  happy that they did not know what to do. Klara felt that she must  play with them. She put one little foot into the water to attract  their attention. Bing! The water seemed alive with scuttling things.  Swish! The grotto was so quiet that she could not believe that there  was anything living in it.    \"A little farther on, Klara came upon a sight even more wonderful  than this--a village of mer-people. It was set so far down in the  water that it seemed a million miles away. And yet the water was so  clear that she felt she could touch the housetops.    \"The mer-houses seemed to be made of a beautiful, sparkling white  coral with big, wide-open windows through which the tide drifted.  The mer-streets seemed to be cobbled in pearl, the sidewalks to be  paved in gold. At their sides grew mer-trees, the highest she had  ever seen, with all kinds of beautiful singing fish roosting in  their branches. Little mer-boats of carved pink coral with purple  seaweed sails or of mother-of-pearl with rosy, mer-flower-petal  sails, were floating through the streets. In some, sat little  mer-maidens, the sunlight flashing on their pretty green scales, on  their long, golden tresses, on the bright mirrors they held in their  hands. Other boats held little mer-boys who made beautiful music on  the harps they carried.    \"At one end of the mer-village Klara could see one palace, bigger  and more beautiful than all the others. Through an open window she  caught a glimpse of the mer-king--a jolly old fellow with a fat red  face and a long white beard sitting on a throne of gold. At his side  reclined the mer-queen--a very beautiful lady with a skin as white as  milk and eyes as green as emeralds. Little mer-princes and little  mer-princesses were playing on the floor with tiny mer-kittens and  tinier mer-puppies. One sweet little mer-baby was tiptailing towards  the window with a pearl that she had stolen from her sister's  coronet.    \"It seemed to Klara that this mer-village was the most enchanting  place that she had ever seen in her life. Oh, how she wanted to live  there!    \"'Oh, good mer-king,' she called entreatingly, 'and good mer-queen,  please let me come to live in your palace.'    \"Bing! The water rustled and roiled as if all the birds of paradise  that the world contained had taken flight. Swish! It was perfectly  quiet again. The mer-village was as deserted as a graveyard.    \"'Well, if they don't want me, they shan't get me, Klara said. And  she walked on twice as proud.'    \"By this time she was getting closer and closer to the moon. The  nearer she came the bigger it grew. Now it filled the entire sky.  The door had remained open all this time. Through it she could see a  garden--a garden more beautiful than any fairy-tale garden that she  had ever read about. From the doorway silvery paths stretched  between hedges as high as a giant's head. Sometimes these paths  ended in fountains whose spray twisted into all kinds of fairy-like  shapes. Sometimes these paths seemed to stop flush against the  clouds. Nearer stretched flower-beds so brilliant that you would  have thought a kaleidoscope had broken on the ground. Birds, like  living jewels, flew in and out through the tree-branches. They sang  so hard that it seemed to Klara they must burst their little  throats. From the branches hung all kinds of precious stones, all  kinds of delicious-looking fruits and candies.    \"Klara could not scramble through the door quickly enough.    \"But as she put one foot on the threshold the little old lady  appeared. She looked as if she had stepped out of a fairy-tale. And  yet Klara had a strange feeling of discomfort when she looked at  her. It seemed to Klara that the old lady's mouth was cruel and her  eyes hard.    \"'Are you the little girl who's run away?' the old lady asked.    \"'Yes,' Klara faltered.    \"'And you want to live in the Kingdom of the Moon?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'Enter then.'    \"The old lady stepped aside and Klara marched across the threshold.  She felt the door swinging to behind her. She heard a bang as it  closed, shutting her out of the world and into the moon.    \"And then--and then--what do you think happened?\"    Billy stopped for a moment. Rosie and Maida rose to their knees.    \"What happened?\" they asked breathlessly.    \"The garden vanished as utterly as if it were a broken soap-bubble.  Gone were the trees and the flowers; gone were the fountains and the  birds; gone, too, were the jewels, the candies and the fruits.    \"The place had become a huge, dreary waste, stretching as far as  Klara could see into the distance. It seemed to her as if all the  trash that the world had outgrown had been dumped here--it was so  covered with heaps of old rubbish.    \"Klara turned to the old lady. She had not changed except that her  cruel mouth sneered.    \"Klara burst into tears. 'I want to go home,' she screamed. 'Let me  go back to my mother.'    \"The old lady only smiled. 'You open that door and let me go back to  my mother,' Klara cried passionately.    \"'But I can't open it,' the old lady said. 'It's locked. I have no  keys.'    \"'Where are the keys?' Klara asked.    \"The old lady pointed to the endless heaps of rubbish. 'There,  somewhere,' she said.    \"'I'll find them,' Klara screamed, 'and open that door and run back  to my home. You shan't keep me from my own dear mother, you wicked  woman.'    \"'Nobody wants to keep you,' the old lady said. 'You came of your  own accord. Find the keys if you want to go back.'    \"That was true and Klara wisely did not answer. But you can fancy  how she regretted coming. She began to search among the dump-heaps.  She could find no keys. But the longer she hunted the more  determined she grew. It seemed to her that she searched for weeks  and weeks.    \"It was very discouraging, very dirty and very fatiguing work. She  moved always in a cloud of dust. At times it seemed as if her back  would break from bending so much. Often she had to bite her lips to  keep from screaming with rage after she had gone through a  rubbish-pile as high as her head and, still, no keys. All kinds of  venomous insects stung her. All kinds of vines and brambles scratched  her. All kinds of stickers and thistles pricked her. Her little feet  and hands bled all the time. But still she kept at it. After that first  conversation, Klara never spoke with the old lady again. After a few  days Klara left her in the distance. At the end of a week, the  moon-door was no longer in sight when Klara looked back.    \"But during all those weeks of weary work Klara had a chance to  think. She saw for the first time what a naughty little girl she had  been and how she had worried the kindest mother in the world. Her  longing for her mother grew so great at times that she had to sit  down and cry. But after a while she would dry her eyes and go at the  hunt with fresh determination.    \"One day she caught a glint of something shining from a clump of  bushes. She had to dig and dig to get at it for about these bushes  the ashes were packed down hard. But finally she uncovered a pair of  iron keys. On one was printed in letters of gold, 'I'M SORRY,' on  the other, 'I'LL NEVER DO SO AGAIN.'    \"Klara seized the keys joyfully and ran all the long way back to the  great door. It had two locks. She put one key in the upper lock,  turned it--a great bolt jarred. She put the other key into the second  lock, turned it--a great bolt jarred. The door swung open.    \"'I'm sorry,' Klara whispered to herself. 'I'll never do so again.'    \"She had a feeling that as long as she said those magic words,  everything would go well with her.    \"Extending out from the door was the Wake of Gold. Klara bounded  through the opening and ran. She turned back after a few moments and  there was the old lady with her cat and her broomstick standing in  the doorway. But the old lady's face had grown very gentle and kind.    \"Klara did not look long. She ran as fast as she could pelt across  the golden path, whispering, 'I'm sorry. I will never do so again.  I'm sorry. I will never do so again. I'm sorry. I will never do so  again.'    \"And as she ran all the little mer-people came to the surface of the  water to encourage her. The little mer-maidens flashed their mirrors  at her. The little mer-boys played wonderful music on their harps.  The mer-king gave her a jolly smile and the mer-queen blew her a  kiss. All the little mer-princesses and all the little mer-princes  held up their pets to her. Even the mer-baby clapped her dimpled  hands.    \"And farther on all the little sea horses with the sea urchins on  their backs assembled in bobbing groups. And farther on all the  little rainbow fishes gathered in shining files. As she ran all the  scratches and gashes in her flesh healed up.    \"After a while she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#18)"],[1,"nowhere,\" Polani said. \"The sand is piled up to the roof  on that side of the house.\"    \"It is,\" Francis agreed; \"but there may be a lower room there,  completely covered with the sand. At any rate, we will see.\"    He pushed against the door, but it did not give in the slightest.    \"It may be the sand,\" he said. \"It may be bolts.\"    He went to the outside door, and called in the sailors with the  hatchets.    \"Break open that door,\" he said.    \"There is a space behind,\" he exclaimed, as the first blow was given.  \"It is hollow, I swear. It would be a different sound altogether if  sand was piled up against it.\"    A dozen blows and the fastenings gave, and, sword in hand, the merchant  and Francis rushed through.    Both gave a shout of delight. They were in a room built out at the back  of the hut. It was richly furnished, and hangings of Eastern stuffs  covered the walls. A burning lamp hung from the ceiling. Two men stood  irresolute with drawn swords, having apparently turned round just as  the door gave way; for as it did so, two figures struggled to their  feet from a couch behind them, for some shawls had been wrapped round  their heads, and with a cry of delight rushed forward to meet their  rescuers. Seated at the end of the couch, with bowed down head, was  another female figure.    \"Maria--Giulia!\" the merchant exclaimed, as, dropping his sword, he  clasped his daughters in his arms.    Francis, followed by the two sailors with hatchets, advanced towards  the men.    \"Drop your swords and surrender,\" he said. \"Resistance is useless.  There are a dozen men outside.\"    The men threw their swords down on the ground.    \"Lead them outside, and bind them securely,\" Francis said.    For the next minute or two, few words were spoken. The girls sobbed  with delight on their father's breast, while he himself was too moved  to do more than murmur words of love and thankfulness. Francis went  quietly out and spoke to the captain, who went in to the inner room,  touched the sitting figure on the shoulder, and, taking her by the arm,  led her outside.    \"Come in, Francis,\" Polani called a minute later.    \"My dears, it is not me you must thank for your rescue. It is your  English friend here who has again restored you to me. It is to him we  owe our happiness, and that you, my child, are saved from the dreadful  fate of being forced to be the wife of that villain Mocenigo.    \"Embrace him, my dears, as a brother, for he has done more than a  brother for you. And now tell me all that has happened since I last saw  you.\"    \"You know, father, the message that was brought us, that you had been  hurt and wanted us home?\"    \"Yes, my dears, that I learned soon afterwards. I went at five o'clock  to fetch you home, and found that you had gone, and why.\"    \"Well, father, directly we had taken our seats in the cabin of the  gondola, our gouvernante closed the doors, and soon afterwards she slid  to the two shutters before the windows. We cried out in surprise at  finding ourselves in the dark, but she bade us be quiet, in a tone  quite different to any in which she had ever spoken to us before. We  were both frightened, and tried to push back the shutters and open the  door, but they were fastened firmly. I suppose there was some spring  which held them. Then we screamed; but I could feel that the inside was  all thickly padded. I suppose our voices could not be heard outside. I  thought so, because once I thought I heard the gondoliers singing, but  it was so faint that I could not be sure. Then the air seemed  stiflingly close, and I fainted; and when I came to myself one of the  windows was open, and Giulia said she had promised we would not scream,  but I think we were beyond the canals then, for I could see nothing but  the sky as we passed along. When I was better the windows were almost  shut again, so that we could not see out, though a little air could get  in; then the gondola went on for a long time.    \"At last it stopped, and she said we must be blindfolded. We said we  would not submit to it, and she told us unless we let her do it, the  men would do it. So we submitted, and she wrapped shawls closely over  our heads. Then we were helped ashore, and walked some distance. At  last the shawls were taken off our heads, and we found ourselves here,  and here we have been ever since.\"    \"You have not been ill treated in any way, my children?\" the merchant  asked anxiously.    \"Not at all, father. Until today, nobody has been into this room  besides ourselves and that woman. The door was generally left a little  open for air, for you see there are no windows here. She used to go  into the next room and come back with our food. We could see men moving  about in there, but they were very quiet, and all spoke in low tones.    \"You may think how we upbraided our gouvernante for her treachery, and  threatened her with your anger. She told us we should never be found,  and that I might as well make up my mind to marry Ruggiero Mocenigo,  for if I did not consent quietly, means would be found to compel me to  do so. I said I would die first, but she used to laugh a cruel laugh,  and say he would soon be here with the priest, and that it mattered not  whether I said yes or no. The ceremony would be performed, and then  Ruggiero would sail away with me to the East, and I should be glad  enough then to make peace between him and you. But he never came. I  think she became anxious, for she went away twice for three or four  hours, and locked us in here when she went.    \"That, father, is all we know about it. Where are we?\"    \"You are at San Nicolo.\"    \"On the island!\" Maria exclaimed in surprise. \"She told us we were on  the mainland. And now, how did you find us?\"    \"I will tell you as we go home, Maria.\"    \"Yes, that will be better, father. Giulia and I long for a breath of  fresh air, and the sight of the blue sky.\"    \"Giulia has not had so much to frighten her as you have,\" her father  said.    \"Yes, I have, father; for she said I was to go across the seas with  Maria, and that Ruggiero would soon find a husband for me among his  friends. I told her she was a wicked woman, over and over again, and we  told her that we were sure you would forgive, and even reward her, if  she would take us back again to you. When she was away, we thought we  would try to make our escape behind, and we made a little hole in the  boards; but the sand came pouring in, and we found we were underground,  though how we got there we didn't know, for we had not come down any  steps. So we had to give up the idea of escape.\"    \"You are partly underground,\" her father said, \"for, as you will see  when you get out, the sand has drifted up at the back of the hut to the  roof, and has altogether hidden this part of the hut; so that we did  not know that there was more than one room, and I should never have  thought of breaking into that door, had it not been for Francisco. And  now come along, my dears. Let us wait here no longer.\"    The sailors and servitors broke into a cheer as the girls came out of  the hut.    \"Shall we put a torch to this place?\" Francis asked Polani.    \"No, Francisco. It must be searched thoroughly first.    \"Captain Lontano, do you order four of your men to remain here, until  some of the officials of the state arrive. If anyone comes before that,  they must seize them and detain them as prisoners. The state will  investigate the matter to the bottom.\"    Now that they were in the open air, the merchant could see that the  close confinement and anxiety had told greatly upon his daughters. Both  were pale and hollow eyed, and looked as if they had suffered a long  illness. Seeing how shaken they were, he ordered one of the retainers  to go to the gondola, and tell the men to row it round to the nearest  point to the hut. The party then walked along down to the shore.    In a few minutes the gondola arrived. Polani, his two daughters, and  Francis took their places in it. The four men, bound hand and foot,  were laid in the bottom of the ship's boat; the gouvernante was made to  take her place there also, and the sailors were told to follow closely  behind the gondola, which was rowed at a very slow pace.    On the way, Polani told his daughters of the manner in which Francis  had discovered the place of concealment.    \"Had it not been for him, my dears, we should certainly not have found  you, and that villain would have carried out his plans, sooner or  later. He would either have given his guards the slip, or, when no  evidence was forthcoming against him, they would have been removed. He  would then have gone outside the jurisdiction of the republic, obtained  a ship with a crew of desperadoes, sailed round to the seaward side of  San Nicolo, and carried you off. Nothing could have saved you, and your  resistance would, as that woman told you, have been futile.\"    \"We shall be grateful to you all our lives, Francisco,\" Maria said. \"We  shall pray for you always, night and morning.    \"Shall we not, Giulia?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" the young girl said simply. \"We shall love him all our  lives.\"    \"Answer for yourself, Giulia,\" Maria said with a laugh, her spirits  returning in the bright sunshine and fresh air. \"When Francisco asks  for my love, it will be quite soon enough to say what I think about  it.\"    \"I should never have courage enough to do that, signora. I know what  you would say too well.\"    \"What should I say?\" Maria asked.    \"You would say I was an impudent boy.\"    Maria laughed.    \"I cannot think of you as a boy any longer, Francisco,\" she said more  gravely. \"I have, perhaps, regarded you as a boy till now, though you  did save us so bravely before; but you see you are only my own age, and  a girl always looks upon a boy of her own age as ever so much younger  than she is herself. Besides, too, you have none of the airs of being a  man, which some of my cousins have; and never pay"]]]
