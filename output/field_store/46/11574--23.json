Bake in muffin rings  or hot greased gem pans. One-half the recipe will be enough for a small  family.      ~ENGLISH MUFFINS~--One pint milk, two level tablespoons shortening  (butter or lard), two level teaspoons sugar, one level teaspoon salt,  one yeast cake dissolved in one-fourth cup lukewarm water, flour. Scald  the milk and add the shortening, sugar, and salt. When lukewarm add the  yeast and sufficient flour to make a good batter. Here one's judgment  must be used. Beat well and let rise until double in bulk. Warm and  butter a griddle and place on it buttered muffin rings. Fill not quite  half full of the batter, cover and cook slowly until double, then heat  the griddle quickly and cook for about ten minutes, browning nicely  underneath. Then turn them and brown the other side. When cool split,  toast and butter.      ~GRAHAM MUFFINS~--Heat to the boiling point two cups of milk, add a  tablespoon of butter and stir until melted. Sift two cups of whole wheat  flour, one-half cup of white flour, two teaspoons of baking powder. Pour  on the milk and butter, beat, add the yolks of two eggs well beaten,  then the stiffly beaten whites. Bake in hot greased gem pans.      ~HOMINY MUFFINS~--Sift twice together one and one-half cups of flour,  three level teaspoons of baking powder, one level tablespoon of sugar,  and a saltspoon of salt. To one cup of boiled hominy add two tablespoons  of melted butter and one cup of milk. Add to the dry ingredients and  beat, then add two well beaten eggs. Pour the batter into hot greased  gem pans and bake.      ~MUFFINS~--Sift a saltspoon of salt, two level teaspoons of baking  powder, and two cups of flour together. Beat the yolks of two eggs, add  one cup of milk, two tablespoons of melted butter, and the dry  ingredients. Beat, add lightly the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs,  fill hot buttered gem pans two-thirds full, and bake in a hot oven.      ~QUICK MUFFINS IN RINGS~--Beat two eggs, yolks and whites separately.  Add to the yolks two cups of milk, one level teaspoon of salt, one  tablespoon of melted butter and two cups of flour in which two level  teaspoons of baking powder have been sifted, and last the stiffly beaten  whites of the eggs. When well mixed bake in greased muffin rings on a  hot griddle. Turn over when risen and set, as both sides must be  browned.      ~BOILED RICE MUFFINS~--To make muffins with cooked rice, sift two and  one-quarter cups of flour twice with five level teaspoons of baking  powder, one rounding tablespoon of sugar, and a saltspoon of salt. Put  in one well beaten egg, half a cup of milk, and three-quarters cup of  boiled rice mixed with another half cup of milk, and two tablespoons of  melted butter. Beat well, pour into hot gem pans and bake.      ~BOSTON BROWN BREAD~--To make one loaf sift together one cup of  cornmeal, one cup rye meal, and one cup of graham flour, with  three-quarters cup of molasses and one and three-quarters cup sweet  milk. Add one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in warm water. Turn  into a well buttered mold which may be a five-pound lard pail, if no  other mold is handy. Set on something that will keep mold from bottom of  kettle and turn enough boiling water to come half way up on the mold.  Cover the kettle and keep the kettle boiling steadily for three and  one-half hours. If water boils away add enough boiling water to keep the  same amount of water in kettle. Put in molds and cut when cool.      ~CRISP WHITE CORNCAKE~--Two cups scalded milk, one cup white cornmeal,  two level teaspoons salt. Mix the salt and cornmeal and add gradually  the hot milk. When well mixed, pour into a buttered dripping pan and  bake in a moderate oven until crisp. Serve cut in squares. The mixture  should not be more than one-fourth inch deep when poured into pan.      ~CROUTONS~--Croutons made coarsely are no addition to a soup. For the  best sort, cut out stale bread into half-inch slices, spread with  butter, then trim away the crust. Cut into small cubes, put into a pan  and set in a hot oven. If the croutons incline to brown unevenly shake  the pan.      ~EGG BREAD~--One pint of boiling water, half pint white cornmeal to  teaspoon salt, two tablespoonfuls of butter, two eggs, one cup milk,  bake in a moderate oven.      ~GRAHAM BREAD~--Put one cup of scalded and cooled milk, one cup of  water, two cups of flour and one-half yeast cake dissolved in one cup of  lukewarm water into a bowl and let rise over night. In the morning add a  level teaspoon of salt, two rounding cups of graham flour and one-half  cup sugar. Beat well, put into two pans and let rise until light and  bake one hour.      ~NUT BREAD~--One and one-half cups of white flour, two cups of graham  flour, one-half cup of cornmeal, one-half cup of brown sugar and  molasses, one pint of sweet milk, one cup of chopped walnuts, two  teaspoons of baking powder, one-half teaspoon of salt. Bake in a long  pan for three-quarters of an hour.      ~OATMEAL BREAD~--Over a pint of rolled oats pour a quart of boiling  water. When cool add one teaspoonful suet, one teaspoon butter, one-half  cup molasses and one-half yeast cake dissolved in a little water. Stir  this thoroughly and then add two quarts sifted flour. Do not knead this  and allow it to rise over night, and in the morning stir it again, and  then put it in well buttered bread pans: let it rise until it fills the  pans and then bake in a moderate oven. It takes a little longer to bake  than white bread.      ~OATMEAL BREAD~--Cook one cup of rolled oats in water for serving at  breakfast, and one cup of molasses, one and one-half cups of lukewarm  water in which is dissolved one yeast cake and one teaspoon of salt. Mix  in enough flour to make a stiff dough, cover and let rise. When very  light stir down, put in pans, let rise light and bake in a slow oven.  The heat should be sufficient at first to check the rising, then the  baking should be slow.      ~ORIENTAL OATMEAL BREAD~--Take two cupfuls of rolled oats, put in bread  pan, turn on four cupfuls of boiling water, stir for awhile. Add, while  hot, a heaping tablespoonful of lard or one scant tablespoonful of  butter and one of lard, two teaspoonfuls of salt and four tablespoonfuls  of sugar and three of molasses. Now add two cupfuls of cold water  (making six cups of water in all) and, if cool enough, add one yeast  cake dissolved in a very little water. Now stir in all the white flour  it will take until it is as stiff as you can manage it with the spoon.  Set in warm place over night, and in the morning with spoon and knife  fill your tins part full, let rise to nearly top of pan, then bake an  hour for medium size loaves.      ~RAISIN BREAD~--Scald three cups of milk and add one teaspoon of salt  and two tablespoons of sugar. Cool and add one-half yeast cake,  dissolved in one-quarter cup of lukewarm water. Mix in enough flour to  make a drop batter and set to rise. When this sponge is light put in two  cups of seeded raisins and enough flour to make a soft dough, but stiff  enough to knead. Let rise again, then mold into two loaves. Let the  loaves double in size and bake slowly, covering with another pan for the  first twenty minutes of baking.      ~STEAMED BROWN BREAD~--Beat one egg light, add one cup of cornmeal, one  cup rye-meal and one and one-half cups of flour sifted with a half level  teaspoon of salt. Add one cup of molasses, and after it is turned out  put in one level teaspoon of soda and fill with boiling water. Add to  the other one-third cup more of the water. Pour into well buttered mold  and steam four hours.      ~SOUTHERN CORNCAKE~--Mix two cups of white cornmeal, a rounding  tablespoon of sugar and a level teaspoon of salt, then pour enough hot  milk or milk and water to moisten the meal well, but not to make it of a  soft consistency. Let stand until cool, then add three well beaten eggs  and spread on a buttered shallow pan about half an inch thick. Bake in a  quick oven, cut in squares, split and butter while hot.      ~STEAMED CORN BREAD~--Sift together one cup cornmeal and flour and a  level teaspoon of salt. Put one level teaspoon soda in one tablespoon of  water, add to one-half cup of molasses and stir into the meal with one  and two-thirds cups of milk. Beat and turn into a greased mold. Steam  four hours, take off the lid of the mold and set in the oven fifteen  minutes.      ~STEAMED GRAHAM BREAD~--Put into a mixing bowl two cups of sour milk,  one cup of molasses, one level teaspoon of salt, two of soda and then  enough graham flour to make a batter as stiff as can be stirred with a  spoon, adding one-half cup of seeded raisins. Pour into a two-quart mold  or lard pail well greased, cover closely and set in a kettle of boiling  water that comes two-thirds the depth of the mold. Cover the kettle and  keep the water boiling constantly for four hours.      ~WHOLE WHEAT BREAD~--Scald one cupful of milk and one teaspoonful of  butter, one of salt, one cup of water and one tablespoonful of sugar.  When lukewarm add half a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in a little  water and enough wheat flour to make a thin batter. Beat vigorously  until smooth and let rise until very light. Add as much whole wheat  flour as you can beat in with a spoon. Pour into greased tins, let rise  until light and bake in moderate oven for one hour.    ~ASPARAGUS FRITTERS~--Make a thick sauce with one-half cup of milk, one  rounding tablespoon of butter and one-quarter cup of flour. Stir in one  cup of cooked asparagus tips and cool. Add one beaten egg and cook on a  hot buttered griddle in small cakes.      ~CORN FRITTERS~--One-half can corn, one-half cup flour, one-half level  teaspoon baking powder, one level teaspoon salt, a dash of cayenne and  one egg. Chop the corn fine and add the flour, sifted with the baking  powder, salt and cayenne.

Similarly, in the case  of affirmative propositions, we saw that this rule requires us to assume  that their predicates are undistributed.    As to the grounds of this maxim, not to go beyond the evidence, not to  distribute a term that is given as undistributed, it is one of the  things so plain that to try to justify is only to obscure them. Still,  we must here state explicitly what Formal Logic assumes to be contained  or implied in the evidence afforded by any proposition, such as 'All S  is P.' If we remember that in chap. iv. Sec. 7, it was assumed that every  term may have a contradictory; and if we bear in mind the principles of  Contradiction and Excluded Middle, it will appear that such a  proposition as 'All S is P' tells us something not only about the  relations of 'S' and 'P,' but also of their relations to 'not-S' and  'not-P'; as, for example, that 'S is not not-P,' and that 'not-P is  not-S.' It will be shown in the next chapter how Logicians have  developed these implications in series of Immediate Inferences.    If it be asked whether it is true that every term, itself significant,  has a significant contradictory, and not merely a formal contradictory,  generated by force of the word 'not,' it is difficult to give any better  answer than was indicated in Sec.Sec. 3-5, without venturing further into  Metaphysics. I shall merely say, therefore, that, granting that some  such term as 'Universe' or 'Being' may have no significant  contradictory, if it stand for 'whatever can be perceived or thought  of'; yet every term that stands for less than 'Universe' or 'Being' has,  of course, a contradictory which denotes the rest of the universe. And  since every argument or train of thought is carried on within a special  'universe of discourse,' or under a certain _suppositio_, we may say  that _within the given suppositio every term has a contradictory_, and  that every predication concerning a term implies some predication  concerning its contradictory. But the name of the _suppositio_ itself  has no contradictory, except with reference to a wider and inclusive  _suppositio_.    The difficulty of actual reasoning, not with symbols, but about matters  of fact, does not arise from the principles of Logic, but sometimes from  the obscurity or complexity of the facts, sometimes from the ambiguity  or clumsiness of language, sometimes from the deficiency of our own  minds in penetration, tenacity and lucidity. One must do one's best to  study the facts, and not be too easily discouraged.          CHAPTER VII    IMMEDIATE INFERENCES      Sec. 1. Under the general title of Immediate Inference Logicians discuss  three subjects, namely, Opposition, Conversion, and Obversion; to which  some writers add other forms, such as Whole and Part in Connotation,  Contraposition, Inversion, etc. Of Opposition, again, all recognise  four modes: Subalternation, Contradiction, Contrariety and  Sub-contrariety. The only peculiarities of the exposition upon which we  are now entering are, that it follows the lead of the three Laws of  Thought, taking first those modes of Immediate Inference in which  Identity is most important, then those which plainly involve  Contradiction and Excluded Middle; and that this method results in  separating the modes of Opposition, connecting Subalternation with  Conversion, and the other modes with Obversion. To make up for this  departure from usage, the four modes of Opposition will be brought  together again in Sec. 9.    Sec. 2. Subalternation.--Opposition being the relation of propositions that  have the same matter and differ only in form (as A., E., I., O.),  propositions of the forms A. and I. are said to be Subalterns in  relation to one another, and so are E. and O.; the universal of each  quality being distinguished as 'subalternans,' and the particular as  'subalternate.'    It follows from the principle of Identity that, the matter of the  propositions being the same, if A. is true I. is true, and that if E. is  true O. is true; for A. and E. predicate something of _All S_ or _All  men_; and since I. and O. make the same predication of _Some S_ or  _Some men_, the sense of these particular propositions has already been  predicated in A. or E. If _All S is P, Some S is P_; if _No S is P, Some  S is not P_; or, if _All men are fond of laughing, Some men are_; if _No  men are exempt from ridicule, Some men are not_.    Similarly, if I. is false A. is false; if O. is false E. is false. If we  deny any predication about _Some S_, we must deny it of _All S_; since  in denying it of _Some_, we have denied it of at least part of _All_;  and whatever is false in one form of words is false in any other.    On the other hand, if I. is true, we do not know that A. is; nor if O.  is true, that E. is; for to infer from _Some_ to _All_ would be going  beyond the evidence. We shall see in discussing Induction that the great  problem of that part of Logic is, to determine the conditions under  which we may in reality transcend this rule and infer from _Some_ to  _All_; though even there it will appear that, formally, the rule is  observed. For the present it is enough that I. is an immediate inference  from A., and O. from E.; but that A. is not an immediate inference from  I., nor E. from O.    Sec. 3. Connotative Subalternation.--We have seen (chap. iv. Sec. 6) that if  the connotation of one term is only part of another's its denotation is  greater and includes that other's. Hence genus and species stand in  subaltern relation, and whatever is true of the genus is true of the  species: If _All animal life is dependent on vegetation, All human life  is dependent on vegetation_. On the other hand, whatever is not true of  the species or narrower term, cannot be true of the whole genus: If it  is false that '_All human life is happy_,' it is false that '_All animal  life is happy_.'    Similar inferences may be drawn from the subaltern relation of  predicates; affirming the species we affirm the genus. To take Mill's  example, if _Socrates is a man, Socrates is a living creature_. On the  other hand, denying the genus we deny the species: if _Socrates is not  vicious, Socrates is not drunken_.    Such cases as these are recognised by Mill and Bain as immediate  inferences under the principle of Identity. But some Logicians might  treat them as imperfect syllogisms, requiring another premise to  legitimate the conclusion, thus:          _All animal life is dependent on vegetation;        All human life is animal life;      .'. All human life is dependent on vegetation._    Or again:          _All men are living creatures;        Socrates is a man;      .'. Socrates is a living creature._    The decision of this issue turns upon the question (_cf._ chap. vi. Sec. 3)  how far a Logician is entitled to assume that the terms he uses are  understood, and that the identities involved in their meanings will be  recognised. And to this question, for the sake of consistency, one of  two answers is required; failing which, there remains the rule of thumb.  First, it may be held that no terms are understood except those that are  defined in expounding the science, such as 'genus' and 'species,'  'connotation' and 'denotation.' But very few Logicians observe this  limitation; few would hesitate to substitute 'not wise' for 'foolish.'  Yet by what right? Malvolio being foolish, to prove that he is not-wise,  we may construct the following syllogism:          _Foolish is not-wise;        Malvolio is foolish;      .'. Malvolio is not-wise._    Is this necessary? Why not?    Secondly, it may be held that all terms may be assumed as understood  unless a definition is challenged. This principle will justify the  substitution of 'not-wise' for 'foolish'; but it will also legitimate  the above cases (concerning 'human life' and 'Socrates') as immediate  inferences, with innumerable others that might be based upon the  doctrine of relative terms: for example, _The hunter missed his aim_:  therefore, _The prey escaped_. And from this principle it will further  follow that all apparent syllogisms, having one premise a verbal  proposition, are immediate inferences (_cf._ chap. ix. Sec. 4).    Closely connected with such cases as the above are those mentioned by  Archbishop Thomson as \"Immediate Inferences by added Determinants\"  (_Laws of Thought_, Sec. 87). He takes the case: '_A negro is a  fellow-creature_: therefore, _A negro in suffering is a fellow-creature  in suffering_.' This rests upon the principle that to increase the  connotations of two terms by the same attribute or determinant does not  affect the relationship of their denotations, since it must equally  diminish (if at all) the denotations of both classes, by excluding the  same individuals, if any want the given attribute. But this principle is  true only when the added attribute is not merely the same verbally, but  has the same significance in qualifying both terms. We cannot argue _A  mouse is an animal_; therefore, _A large mouse is a large animal_; for  'large' is an attribute relative to the normal magnitude of the thing  described.    Sec. 4. Conversion is Immediate Inference by transposing the terms of a  given proposition without altering its quality. If the quantity is also  unaltered, the inference is called 'Simple Conversion'; but if the  quantity is changed from universal to particular, it is called  'Conversion by limitation' or '_per accidens._' The given proposition is  called the 'convertend'; that which is derived from it, the 'converse.'    Departing from the usual order of exposition, I have taken up Conversion  next to Subalternation, because it is generally thought to rest upon the  principle of Identity, and because it seems to be a good method to  exhaust the forms that come only under Identity before going on to those  that involve Contradiction and Excluded Middle. Some, indeed, dispute"]]]
