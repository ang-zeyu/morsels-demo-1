Their muzzles were in the  mud; their hind legs were wide apart.    \"Ow aye, I looked away and saw the white eyes of the mother of the  pack. She was creeping up. Her lips were wet; the hair on her neck  stood up. Behind her came others. I gave the low growl of a lion--  the cry he makes when he is angry at being disturbed. She threw up  her head and sniffed the air. Then she growled in her throat, for  there was no taint of lion in the air, but the taint of man! Her  white eyes found me out where I sat in a low tree, and there was  death in them. So I gathered the air in my lungs and shouted. A  man's shout is as much dreaded as the lion's roar. The dogs jumped  up, but the old mother called to them, and they crouched down.  The  brothers stood moaning head to head. I shouted again; I whistled.  Then the bulls drew apart. One fell slowly on his side; the other  smelt at the fallen one. Then he tried to bellow, but his tongue was  thick in his mouth. The she-dog crept forward, and I whistled loud.  This time he flung up his head and looked around. He saw the white  eyes above the grass; he saw the round ears everywhere around. Then  he smelt at his brother. Wow! He smelt at him; he licked the blood  from his nostrils.    \"This is the law among the wild things--when one is down he is down.  The weak are driven forth by their fellows; the hurt are left. The  bull smelt at his brother; then again he flung his head up to look  at the white-eyed one, and he moved away for the vlei, moaning as he  went. The dogs let him pass; their eyes scarcely went to him, for  they were fixed on the fallen. They moved upon him in silence, a few  steps at a time, then crouched with hanging tongues; then a few more  steps; and as they closed in the fallen bull watched those he could  see. Meat for dogs! He a chief in the forest, who could toss the  largest dog the height of a tree! Wow! He gathered his hind feet  under him and lifted. Slowly he reached his feet, and the white-eyed  mother ran in open-mouthed. She gripped the sinews of his hind leg  and held on. The pack crowded in. Haw! It was no fight. The bull  looked after his brother, who was slowly moving to the vlei, moaning  as he went. Then, but for a little time, he fought as a chief should  fight when his foes are on him. With a swing of his head here, and a  swing there, he stove in the ribs of two of the pack; then he sprang  on another, flung him, as a boy would a stone, into the air, watched  him go up, watched him come down, then flung him up again, and fell  forward on his knees with his nose on the ground, and the pack  snapped the flesh from him in mouthfuls. The other bull turned not  at the howling of the pack. He walked on slow and straight to the  vlei, drank deep, and made a bed in the mud. He covered his wounds  with mud, and when his wounds were healed he was an outcast. The  troop had another leader, and the old cow led them all to another  grazing-ground.\"    \"And what became of you, Muata?\"    \"Muata stayed in the tree. Mawoh! Muata was afraid. The mother of  the pack had not forgotten. Even while she ate she looked at him,  and when the milk-mothers with their young came to the forest,  having been called, she lay off and watched, with her evil eyes on  me. The jackals, smelling blood, howled, sitting on their haunches,  and a lion came up growling in his throat. But he did not come right  up; he stood a way off, watching,  and presently he stretched  himself on his stomach to wait. Haw! Even the lion will not attempt  to drive the pack from its kill. Ow aye, it is so. The old mother  never turned her eyes to watch the lion, but when the pups played,  having eaten their fill, she stood up. The pack looked at her and  moved off; then the lion rose and came forward. The old one stood  her ground, and the great one, when he was within three bounds of  her, also stood. The white eyes turned away from the yellow eyes--  they turned to me; then she yapped and went off after the pack. The  lion looked after her; then he stretched himself on the ground again  and stared. He lifted his head to the wind and sniffed. Mawoh! Well,  I knew the old mother had told him of my presence; but the lion  never looks up. It was well for me, for his mind was uneasy. A long  time he lay, while the jackals sat howling. Then he crept round the  tree and the carcase. Twice he crept round; then, as the smell of  the meal was too much, he trotted up to the carcass and growled at  his feast. His back was toward me, and I fled.\"    \"And did you meet the white-eyed mother again?\"    \"The wisest among the people I have met,\" said Muata, gravely, \"was  a woman; and among the creatures of the forest, the wisest was a  she-dog. It is in my mind that the leader of the pack was umtaguati.  Ow aye, she was a wizard; and it is not well to make war against  such.\"    Venning looked at the chief with curiosity.  \"Are there many wizards  in the forest, Muata?\" he asked with a smile.    \"By day and night, many; but most by night. Our people will not  venture forth in the darkness of the forest for fear of the wizards  and the bad spirits that watch from behind the trees and follow  stealthily; but a spell was given to Muata. He could walk in the  night.\"    \"Have you seen these--eh--spirits, Muata?\" Muata put the question  aside. He rose and pointed to the east.    \"The sun dies away and the hunters return.\"    \"I don't hear them. Where are they?\"  \"The birds cry out and fly.  That is the sign that man is on the move; for hear, you who split up  the shining boat, birds will scold at a leopard or a great snake,  hovering around as they scold; but they fly from man. From nothing  else will they fly. From an eagle they will hide after giving the  warning call; but from man they fly.\"    A few minutes later the two arrived, Mr. Hume carrying an  antelope  on his shoulder.        CHAPTER IX    A LION'S CHARGE    They turned in very early after banking up leaves over the fires  under the biltong strips, to give them a good smoking during the  night, but in the small hours, when the night is at its quietest,  the moonlight, shining on Venning's face, woke him. The fires were  glowing bright, altogether too bright for safety, and he rose to  cover the glare with some green leaves. He looked at his sleeping  companions, for all, tired out by disturbed nights, slept on, except  the jackal, which had one eye open.    Venning sat awhile looking down upon the dim uncertain shadows that  came and went, as a fleecy mist-like cloud passed overhead.  Beyond  the fitful murmur of the wind there was no sound but the hooting of  a great homed owl somewhere from the woods above. Drawing his  blanket round him, and picking up his gun, he walked to a point on  the right overlooking the bed of the little river, and there he sat  down with his back to a rock and his gun over his knees. Scarcely  was he seated when the jackal startled him by its sudden appearance  at his side. He scratched its ears, and it sat close to him, staring  fixedly down on the river. Just below there was a stretch of sand in  the bed gleaming white under the moonlight, and Venning watched this  with the eye of a naturalist, in the hope of seeing some of the  great forms of animal life. And he had his hope, for several  creatures crossed the white patch, and each time the jackal was the  first to see them. The round ears would suddenly prick forward, the  sharp nose would twitch, and then Venning would dimly discover  something down there in the uncertain light. A porcupine he made  out, its quills gleaming and rustling as it went down to the water;  then a great wart-pig  with curved tusks; and next, after a long  interval, a fine buck with long powerful horns. A water-buck he  judged it to be from the length of its horns, and it stood there  long with its face up-stream, motionless, save for the constant  twitching of the large ears. He rested his elbows on his knees as he  sat and aimed at the shoulders, but did not fire, for fear of  alarming the camp; and  presently the buck, even as he watched,  vanished as softly and silently as it came. Then Venning's eyes  closed, his chin dropped, the gun settled between his knees, and he  was asleep.    He was asleep, and he was awake again so suddenly that he did not  know he had slept until he saw the position of the gun. The jackal  plucked at his blanket. He remembered that something had disturbed  him, and he judged that the jackal had done the same thing just  before. He yawned and patted its head; but, instead of sitting down,  it ran a few yards, sniffed the air, whined, came back, glanced long  over its shoulder into the riverbed,  looked into Venning's face,  then ran off in the direction of the camp. As soon as it was gone  Venning felt lonely. He stood up, thinking to return to the camp,  then sat down again, for he heard the sharp stamp that an antelope  makes when alarmed, and he hoped to see it come into the moonlight.  So he settled down to watch again, and drowsiness fell upon his  eyes. He could see the white patch of sand, and as his heavy lids  were lowered and lifted between the drowsy intervals, he became  dimly conscious that there was something on the sand.  Yes; there it  was, something grey, short, and thick. A donkey, he told himself.  He smiled sleepily. A donkey! It was strange to see the old familiar  form out there in the wilderness. He wondered dreamily where it came  from; then a shadow cast by the moon on a passing cloud blotted out  the river-bed. He rubbed his eyes, and when the cloud had gone there  were two animals--donkeys, unmistakably--one larger than the other,  both with their heads turned upwards towards him. Another cloud  sailed by, and when it had passed he missed them, and, his curiosity  roused, he rubbed his eyes again for a closer scrutiny. Surely that  was not a bush on the bank? No! it moved.

It was a Christmas  gift, so I am not sure about the value.\"    \"Well, take another look for it and report to me again to-morrow,\"  answered Captain Putnam, with a heavy sigh. Then, of a sudden, he added:  \"Do you suspect anybody of taking the scarfpin?\"    \"I have no clue whatever to the theft,\" answered Pepper, slowly.    \"But have you any suspicions, Ditmore?\" And the master's voice grew a  trifle stern.    \"Only in a general way.\"    \"Please explain yourself.\"    \"I--er--I hardly know what to say, sir,\" stammered Pepper. \"There may be  nothing in it at all.\"    \"In what? Come, out with it.\"    \"Why, you see, sir, some of the cadets in this school are not good  friends with me and Major Ruddy, and maybe they thought they would play  a trick on us by taking his watch and chain and my scarfpin.\"    \"Humph! a mighty poor trick! Who are those cadets?\"    \"I don't want to accuse them, Captain Putnam.\"    \"I understand. But who are the cadets?\"    \"Reff Ritter and Gus Coulter.\"    \"Oh, yes, I remember now. You and Major Ruddy have had quite some  trouble with them in the past.\"    \"Yes, sir. But I'd hate to think they did such a mean thing as this,\"  added Pepper, hastily.    \"Well, take a look around and report again to-morrow,\" returned Captain  Putnam; and then closed his desk slowly and thoughtfully.    Pepper did take a look around, but it was of no use. Not a trace of the  missing scarfpin could be found.    \"This certainly beats the nation!\" remarked Dale, when the cadets were  talking the affair over. \"First Andy loses his jewelry, then Jack, and  now Pepper. Wonder if I hadn't better put my cuff-links in the captain's  safe?\" And he cut a wry face. \"They cost me a dollar and a quarter.\"    \"I'll wager Captain Putnam would give a good deal to catch the thief,\"  remarked Stuffer. \"Say, Pep, I hope you don't suspect anybody in this  dormitory?\" he added anxiously.    \"No, Stuffer,\" was the quick answer. Then Pepper broke into a grin. \"Of  course, if it was a doughnut, or a pie, I'd suspect you right off!\"    \"Huh! It's no crime to take something to eat!\" grunted Stuffer.    \"I'd hate to think any cadet was guilty,\" came from Emerald. \"'Twould  blacken the character of the whole school, so it would!\"    \"Well, Jack and Pepper have some bitter enemies,\" said Dale,  significantly. And all present knew to whom he referred.    \"Well, you can't always tell,\" said Dale, and shrugged his broad  shoulders.    At that moment Fred Century came hurrying into the dormitory.    \"Have you heard the latest news?\" he cried.    \"No, what is it?\" questioned Andy.    \"Maybe we are going to have an extra holiday,\" suggested Pepper.    \"Better yet, maybe old Crabtree has resigned,\" added Jack.    \"Perhaps Fred is going to give us a spread,\" came from Stuffer. \"I'd  like that first-rate.\"    \"No, the news is more important than all that,\" came from Fred.    \"Well, what is it, Fred?\"    \"Don't keep us on pins and needles any longer!\"    \"Well, the news is, that there have been more robberies committed here,\"  answered Fred.    \"More robberies!\" came from half a dozen throats.    \"Yes. The teachers were going to keep the thing quiet, but it leaked out  through Mumps and Nick Paxton.    \"What has been taken now?\" asked Jack, curiously.    \"A watch, a scarfpin, and a five-dollar gold piece.\"    \"And who was robbed?\" burst out Andy.    \"The watch was taken from Paxton, the scarfpin from Ritter, and Coulter  lost the five-dollar gold piece.\"    \"Is it possible!\" murmured the young major, and then he looked  meaningly at his chums. Here was news indeed!    \"When did you learn of this, Fred?\" asked Dale.    \"Just a few minutes ago. Mumps told me, and Paxton told Frank Barringer.  Ritter, Coulter and Paxton went to the office to report. Mumps said  Ritter was as mad as hops. Ritter's watch was only a silver affair, but  he says it came down to him from his grandfather and was valuable as an  heirloom.\"    \"Well, this is certainly getting interesting,\" was Pepper's comment. \"If  that thief isn't caught he'll end up by cleaning out the whole school.\"    \"After this, I am going to hide my valuables,\" said Dale.    \"Ditto here,\" cried Stuffer. \"I haven't got much, but what I own I want  to keep.\"    A little later the cadets filed out of the dormitory, leaving Jack,  Pepper and Andy together.    \"Well, I am mighty glad I didn't accuse Ritter and Coulter,\" said the  young major. \"This puts something of a different light on the subject.\"    \"But who is guilty, do you think?\" asked Andy.    \"I don't know what to think,\" answered the young major.    \"This will drive Captain Putnam wild,\" came from Pepper. And he was  right; the master of the Hall was worried as he had never been worried  before. He made a rigid investigation, but it brought nothing new to  light. According to the stories told by Ritter, Coulter and Paxton the  articles stolen had been taken from their bureau-drawers, and that was  all those cadets could tell about the mysterious affair.    \"We must set a strict watch, Captain Putnam,\" said George Strong.    \"And we must catch that thief,\" added Josiah. Crabtree, sourly. \"I--I  shall be almost afraid to go to sleep after this!\" he added nervously.    \"If these thefts keep on I don't know what I am going to do,\" said  Captain Putnam, and his voice had a sound of despair in it.          CHAPTER XVII    THE TUG-OF-WAR      For several days nothing was talked of at Putnam Hall but the mysterious  disappearance of the students' watches and jewelry. The cadets could not  get the matter off their minds, and as a consequence recitations became  very poor.    \"I shall offer a substantial reward,\" said Captain Putnam, and one  afternoon a notice was posted in the school proper and in the gymnasium,  offering one hundred dollars for information leading to the capture of  the thief.    \"Say, I shouldn't mind earning that reward!\" murmured Dale.    \"A fellow could have no end of a good time on a hundred dollars!\"  murmured Stuffer. \"Think what a spread he could give!\" And his eyes  sparkled in anticipation.    \"It would be a bad thing for Stuffer to get the reward,\" came from Andy.    \"Why, I'd like to know?\" demanded that cadet.    \"Because you'd eat yourself into a state of acute indigestion.\"    \"Rats! I don't eat any more than you do,\" grumbled Stuffer.    \"Well, I don't see any chance of your getting the reward,\" was Jack's  comment. \"That thief had hidden his tracks well.\"    With the deep snow on the ground, drills had to be held in the  gymnasium, and several contests were also arranged. The cadets got up a  tug-of-war between one team headed by Pepper and another headed by Dale,  and the excitement over this contest waged so high, that the thefts  were, for the time being, forgotten.    The tug-of-war was held late one afternoon in the gymnasium. A line was  drawn on the floor and the long rope laid across this. On either side  wooden cleats were nailed down, so that the contestants might brace  their feet.    The two teams consisted of eight cadets each. With Pepper were Andy,  Jack, and Fred Century, while on Dale's side were Bart Field, Bart  Conners and some other cadets already introduced.    \"Now, then, Pepper!\" cried one of his friends. \"See what you can do!\"    \"Don't give him a chance, Dale! Yank him right over the line!\" cried one  of Dale's friends.    \"I'll bet Pepper Ditmore loses,\" said Nick Paxton, who was present.  Ritter and Coulter had said they did not consider a tug-of-war between  such teams worth witnessing.    Frank Barringer was timekeeper and referee, and at the appointed hour he  made both teams line up and catch hold of the rope.    \"All ready?\" he asked.    There was a moment of silence.    \"Drop!\" was the cry, and on the instant both teams tightened their holds  on the rope and dropped down on the wooden cleats.    \"Hold them, Pepper!\"    \"Don't let 'em haul you up, Dale!\"    \"Glue yourself down, Jack!\"    \"Stone foundation, Fred! Stone foundation!\"    So the cries ran on, as the two tug-of-war teams held on to the long  rope like grim death, each team determined not to give in an inch.    For fully five minutes the rope remained as when the teams had first  dropped. Then, of a sudden, Dale gave a hiss and up came his men, to  haul in on the rope several inches and then drop as before.    \"Hurrah! that's the way to do it!\"    \"Every inch counts, boys!\"    \"Watch your chance for another!\"    \"Get it back, Pepper! Get it back!\"    There followed another tense strain. Then Dale's team came up once more  and brought rope in another six inches.    \"That's the way to do it! Now then, a good, stiff pull and you'll have  'em over!\"    \"Wake up, Pepper! It's time you and your men got on the job!\" cried  Henry Lee.    \"I knew Dale's team would win,\" said Paxton.    Hardly had Paxton spoken when Dale's team came up for another haul. But  this time Pepper and his men were on the alert, and in a twinkling they  commenced to haul in--six inches, a foot, a foot and a half and then two  feet--and then they dropped, the strain being as much as they could  stand.    \"Hurrah! Look at that!\"    \"They got back all they lost and more!\"    \"Hold 'em, Dale! Stone foundation!\"    A great many cries arose. Dale and his supporters braced back as well as  they could. Then Dale gave the word to come up for another haul.    Back and forth went the rope, the center knot first on one side of the  line and then on the other. For several minutes it looked as if Dale's  team might win. But then the tide turned again, and with a strength that  was surprising, Pepper's team gave \"a long pull, a strong pull, and a  pull all together,\" and brought the center knot over the winning line.    \"Hurrah! Pepper Ditmore's team wins!\"    \"Say, that was a great tug, wasn't it?\"    \"My foot slipped!\" said one of Dale's supporters.    \"So did mine,\" same"]]]
