[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#18)"],[1," of evolution, we are thoroughly convinced that there  is no break whatever in the long chain of living beings. Man has no art,  has developed no thing whatever, no mode of language or communication,  that is not to be found in some degree among animals. They are capable  of feeling the same emotions as human beings, and are therefore subject  to the same general laws of life. No science has been more beneficial  than psychology in proving that they are human in all ways; no discovery  made by the human mind is so poetical and of such value as that which  leads mankind to recognise some part of himself in every part of  Nature, even in the language of animals.    This knowledge of all life is recognised by thinking men the world over,  removing forever that artificial barrier by which, in his ignorance and  prejudice, he has separated himself from his lower brothers, the  animals, denying unto them even a means of intelligent communication.  This recognition of the existence of a common language will go far  toward establishing the universal brotherhood of all living creatures.          VIII    IN THEIR BOUDOIRS, HOSPITALS AND CHURCHES        _\"Never stoops the soaring vulture    On his quarry in the desert,    On the sick or wounded bison,    But another vulture, watching    From his high aerial look-out,    Sees the downward plunge and follows,    And a third pursues the second,    Coming from the invisible ether,    First a speck and then a vulture    Till the air is dark with pinions.\"_      Many animals show a surprising knowledge of medical and sanitary laws,  but these laws vary in the different species as much as they do among  humans. Animals are divided into as many classes and social castes as  are mankind; and those that have advanced beyond the nomadic life, and  have fixed homes with servants and luxuries, naturally are more refined  in the matter of their personal care.    Science may yet prove that the old legend of the mermaid sitting on a  rock, with a glass and comb in her hand, was not so far from truth as  we imagine. No doubt, the bright-eyed seals looked like sea-maidens to  many ancient mariners. The originator of the mermaid stories had  possibly seen seals making their toilettes. These beautiful and  affectionate human-like creatures of the water, wear, attached to their  front flipper, a handsome comb-like protuberance. When they rest on the  rocks, they use this little comb to brush the fur on their faces; and  the Northern fur-seals, when the weather is warm, use their flippers as  fans. The secret of teaching seals to play tambourines is due to their  desire to comb their fur and fan themselves!    Members of the cat family are, perhaps, the cleanest of all animals,  with the exception of some of the opossums. Lions, panthers, and pumas  dress themselves very much as the domestic cat performs her toilette.  They use their feet, dipped in water, as wash cloths, and their tongues  as combs and brushes. Hares also use their feet to wash their faces, and  this they do very often, to keep their exquisite hair in perfect  condition. Dogs enjoy wiping their coats against green grass and shrubs.    Certain animals are so fastidious that they have community  beauty-parlours! Goats, deer, giraffes, and antelopes, for example, are  very particular about their personal neatness and cleanliness, and they  come together to assist each other in making toilettes. One of the  reasons that animals suffer so much in captivity, especially when alone,  is that they have no one to help them dress, and some of them, such as  the giraffe, cannot reach all parts of their bodies. I have seen a young  guinea pig that had been rescued from a mud puddle being cleaned by both  of his parents. Water-loving animals, like the beavers, seemingly take  great pride in their toilettes, and in this respect they show more human  traits than any other animal.    It is a general belief that animals are quite care-free, and that when  they awake in the morning there is nothing for them to do but play or  wander about. This is a mistaken belief, for they have to dress  themselves, and this not only means a bath in many cases, but a  smoothing out of their fur and hair. Some are shy and seek the darkest  places to dress themselves, others, like the dog and cat, seek the  hearth. Every one has possibly seen a cow and horse licking each other,  and it is generally believed that this implies special friendship  between the two, but this idea is incorrect; it only implies mutual aid  in making their toilettes. They have a beauty parlour, and thus aid each  other. In no way are animals better prepared to teach man than in their  methods of personal cleanliness, and this means health. Their  utilisation of clay, dust, mud, water, and even sunshine to keep their  health, far exceeds that of mankind. In fact, man's first knowledge of  simple, natural health remedies came from animals. This wisdom they have  acquired by ages of instinct and reason, for theirs has been the normal  life, whereas man's is often abnormal. Each animal is his own  specialist. However, when an animal becomes too ill to doctor himself,  he is treated by another. I have seen a horse licking the wound of one  of his fellows to stop the pain.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    WATER-LOVING ANIMALS, LIKE THE BEAVERS, SEEMINGLY TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN  THEIR TOILETTES. THEIR FUR IS ALWAYS SLEEK AND CLEAN.]    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    GREAT FOREST PIGS OF CENTRAL AFRICA. LIKE THE COMMON DOMESTICATED HOGS,  THEY WILL SEEK A CLAY BATH TO HEAL THEIR WOUNDS.]    Animals know better than man what kind of food they need, for the simple  reason that their tastes are natural, while man has allowed his to  become perverted. In times of sickness absurd practices have been  observed. Ice-cream and buttermilk, for example, were for ages refused  to typhoid fever patients, while to-day they are generally used under  such circumstances. But the natural desire for sour and cold things was  always in evidence; animals have always depended upon these desires.    Among them are skilled dietitians, who restrict their diet in case of  illness, keep quiet, avoid all excitement, seek restful places where  there is plenty of fresh air and clean water. If a dog loses his  appetite, he eats \"dog grass,\" while a sick cat delights in catnip.  Deer, goats, cows, and sheep, when sick seek various medicinal herbs.  When deer or cattle have rheumatism, they invariably seek a health  resort where they may bathe in a sulphur spring and drink of the healing  mineral waters. They also know the full value of lying in the warm sun.    Cats are skilled physicians, and have various home remedies, such as  dipping a feverish foot into cold water, or lying before a warm fire, if  they have a cold. Many animals know how to treat a sore eye--by lying in  the dark, and repeatedly licking their paws and placing them over the  afflicted member.    How wonderful would the human race become, if it had the strength of a  lion, the power of a bear, the wisdom of an elephant, the cleverness of  a fox, and the health of the wild boar! But these qualities are found  chiefly among the animals because of the marvellous knowledge of the  laws of health and self-preservation.    John Wesley claimed, in his directions on the art of keeping well, that  many of the medicines which were used among the common people of his  time were first discovered by watching animals in their medical  practices to cure their ills and pains. \"If they heal animals, they will  also heal men,\" he claimed. The American Indians learned most of their  cures from watching animals, especially the cure of such diseases as  fever, rheumatism, dysentery, and snake-bites. A rheumatic old wolf  would bathe in the warm waters of a sulphur spring; a sick and feverish  deer would eat the fresh leaves of healing ferns, while a wounded hog or  bear would always seek a red-clay bath to heal the wounds. Sick dogs  will invariably eat certain weeds, and an unwell cat will seek healing  mints and grasses.    Old hunters tell us that a deer after having been chased for several  hours by dogs, and after having escaped them by swimming a cold stream,  will, upon reaching safety, lie down in the ice and snow. If a man did  such a thing, he would immediately die. But not so with the deer, for he  will arise about every hour and move around to exercise himself, and on  the morrow he is perfectly well. The same animal, shut up in a warm barn  for the night, as has many times been demonstrated with circus animals,  will be dead by morning.    From this natural method of healing, mankind may learn much, and  especially as it pertains to the treatment of extreme heat, cold,  exhaustion, and paralysis of the muscles, and most especially sores and  wounds. I have seen a wounded hog that had been badly bitten by a dog,  wallow in rich red mud to stop the flow of blood.    It is a common practice for a raccoon actually to amputate a diseased  leg, or one that has been wounded by a gunshot, and wash the stub in  cool flowing water. When it is healing, he licks it with his tongue to  massage it, and also to stop the pain and reduce the swelling. This  wisdom is often classed by the unknowing under the term instinct,  whereas it displays no less skill and knowledge than that of our modern  surgery. The intelligence of the raccoon stands very high in the animal  world.    Foxes, when caught in a trap, will very often gnaw off a limb. This  requires a special power and a moral energy that few men possess.    William J. Long, in the _Outlook_, tells of an unusual proof of animal  surgery in the case of an old muskrat that had cut off both of his  forelegs, probably at different times, and had grown very wise in  avoiding man-made traps, and when found, had covered the wound with a  sticky vegetable gum from a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19855"],[0,"Louis' School Days: A Story for Boys (#18)"],[1,"resting on the  head of his gentle pupil, then, removing one, he placed it under Louis'  chin, and turned the glowing face up to himself and smiled--such a smile  none remembered ever to have seen on that stern face.    \"Have you found all out, sir?\" cried Reginald, starting forward.    The doctor's hand motioned him back, and turning Louis round, so as  to face the school, he said in a distinct, yet excited manner,    \"Young gentlemen, we have been doing a wrong unconsciously, and I,  as one of the first, am anxious to make to the subject of it the only  reparation in my power, by declaring to you all that Louis Mortimer  is entirely innocent of the offence with which he was charged; and  I am sure I may say in the name of you all, as well as of myself,  that we are very sorry that he should have suffered so much on  account of it.\"    [Illustration: Dr. Wilkinson proclaims Louis innocent.]    There was a hum all around, and many of the lower school who knew  nothing of the matter, began whispering among themselves. But all  was hushed directly the doctor resumed his speech.    \"There are some among you who are not aware, I believe, to what I allude;  but those who do know, can bear testimony to the gentle endurance of  false accusation that Louis Mortimer has exhibited during the whole time  he has been made to suffer so severely for the fault of another. I cannot  express my admiration of his conduct--conduct which I am sure has had  for its foundation the fear and love of God. Stay, gentlemen,\" said  the doctor, stilling with a motion of his hand the rising murmur of  approbation, \"all is not yet told. This patient endurance might be  lauded as an unusual occurrence, were there nothing more--but there  is more. Louis Mortimer might have produced proofs of his innocence  and cleared himself in the eyes of us all.\"    \"Louis!\" exclaimed Reginald, involuntarily.    Louis' head was down as far as his master's hand would allow it, and deep  crimson blushes passed quickly over the nearly tearful face--and now the  remembrance of Ferrers, poor Ferrers, who had surely told all. Louis felt  very sorry for him, and almost ashamed on his own account. He wished he  could get behind his master, but that was impossible, and he stood still,  as the doctor continued, \"Three weeks ago Louis discovered that a little  boy was in the study on the day when Kenrick's Key was abstracted, who  could, of course, bring the desired information--the information which  would have righted him in all our eyes; but mark--you who are ready to  revenge injuries--because this would have involved the expulsion of one  who had deeply injured him, he has never, by sign or word, made known to  any one the existence of such information, persuading the little boy also  to keep the secret; and this, which from him I should never have learned,  I have just heard from the guilty person, who, unable to bear the remorse  of his own mind, has voluntarily confessed his sin and Louis' estimable  conduct. Young gentlemen, I would say to all of you, 'GO AND DO LIKEWISE.'\"    During this speech, Reginald had hardly been able to control himself,  especially when he found that Louis had never mentioned his knowledge  to himself; and now he sprang forward, unchecked by the doctor, and,  seizing his brother, who was immediately released, asked, \"Why did you  not tell me, Louis? How was it I never guessed?\"    While he spoke, there was a buz of inquiry at the lower end of the  school, and those who knew the story crowded eagerly up to the dais  to speak to Louis. Alfred's voice was very distinct, for he had worked  himself up to his brother:    \"Edward, tell me all about it. I'm sure if I'd known I'd have told.  I didn't know why Louis was so joyful.\"    Edward could answer nothing: his heart was as full as the doctor's, and  with almost overflowing eyes and a trembling step, he pushed his way to  Louis, who had thrown himself on Reginald and was sobbing violently.    \"Louis, I'm very sorry,\" said one. \"Louis, you'll forgive me--I'm sure  I beg pardon,\" said other voices; and others added, \"How good you are!--I  shouldn't have done it.\"    Louis raised his head from that dear shoulder, so often the place where  it had rested in his troubles, and said, amidst his sobs,    \"Oh! don't praise me. I was very unwilling to do it.\"    \"Let him alone,\" said the doctor. \"Reginald, take him up stairs.  Gentlemen, I can do nothing more, nor you neither, I think, to-day.  I shall give you a holiday for the remainder of it.\"    There was a lull in the noise as Dr. Wilkinson spoke, but just as Louis  was going out, there arose a deafening cheer, three times repeated, and  then the boys picked up their books and hurried out of doors.    Louis' heart was full of gratitude, but at the same time it was  sobered by the recollection of what Ferrers must now suffer, and the  doubt he felt respecting his fate; and as soon as he had recovered  himself, he sought the doctor to beg pardon for him.    \"As he has voluntarily confessed his fault, I shall not expel him,\"  replied the doctor; \"but I intend that he shall beg your pardon before  the school.\"    Louis, however, pleaded so earnestly that he had already suffered enough,  and begged as a favor that nothing more might be said, that at length  Dr. Wilkinson gave way.    The sensation that this event had caused in the school was very great:  those who had been loudest in condemning Louis, were now the loudest in  his praise, and most anxious to load him with every honor; and when he  made his appearance among them with Reginald, whose manly face beamed  with satisfaction and brotherly pride, he was seized by a party, and  against his will, chaired round the playground, everywhere greeted by  loud cheers, with now and then \"A groan for Ferrers!\"    \"Louis, my man, you look sorrowful,\" said Hamilton, as he was landed  at last on the threshold of the school-room door.    \"No, no,\" said Salisbury, who had been foremost in the rioting;  \"cheer up, Louis--what's the matter?\"    \"I am afraid,\" said Louis, turning away.    \"Afraid! of what old boy?\" said Salisbury. \"Come, out with it.\"    \"I am afraid you will make me think too much of what ought not to be  thought of at all--you are all very kind, but--\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Salisbury; \"we're all so vexed that we have been  such bears, and we want to make it up.\"    \"I am sure I do not think any thing about it now,\" said Louis, holding  out both his hands and shaking all by turns; \"I am very happy. Will you  let me ask one thing of you?\"    \"A hundred,\" was the reply; \"and we'll fly on Mercury's pennons to do  your bidding.\"    \"Put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes,\" said Frank Digby.    \"When poor Ferrers comes among us, for my sake, do not take any notice  of what has happened.\"    There was a dark cloud on the faces before Louis, and Hamilton's lip  trembled with scorn. No reply was made.    \"I am the only one who has any thing to forgive; please promise me to  leave him alone.\"    \"Then,\" said Salisbury, abruptly, \"whenever he comes in, I walk out,  for I can't sit in the same room and be civil.    \"I shan't be particularly inclined to favor him with my discourse,\"  said Frank; \"so I promise to leave him alone.\"    \"Will you try to be the same as you were before? Do!\" said Louis.    \"That's impossible!\" they all cried; \"we _cannot_, Louis.\"    \"If you only knew how unhappy he has been, you would pity him very much,\"  said Louis, sorrowfully. \"He has been so very sad--and do not talk of  this to other people, please. I should be so much more happy if you  would try to be the same to him.\"    \"All we can promise, is not to notice it, Louis,\" said Hamilton;  \"and now, don't be sad any longer.\"    Yet Louis was sad and anxious; though now and then a thought that all  was clear, darted like a sunbeam across his mind, and called forth a  grateful emotion. He longed for the holidays to come,--the favor he was  in was almost painful.    Ferrers was invisible till the next evening, when he joined his  class-fellows at prayers. In spite of the half-promise Louis had  obtained from them, a studied unconsciousness of his presence, and  a chilling coldness, greeted him. Louis alone stood by him, and looked  in the deadly white countenance by him with heartfelt sympathy and  compassion; and glanced at several of his companions to remind them  of his wish. Ferrers seemed hardly the same; the proud, bullying air of  arrogance had given place to a saddened, subdued despair; and yet his  expression was far more pleasing in its humility than the natural one.    One or two, noticing Louis' anxiety, addressed him civilly, and even  wished him \"Good-night!\" which he did not return by more than an  inclination of the head. He expected no pity, and had nerved himself  to bear the scorn he had brought on himself; but any attention was a  matter of surprise to him.          CHAPTER X.      Wearily and joylessly had the last week of the examination passed away  for Ferrers; although in one branch he had borne away the palm from all  competitors. His confession had, in some measure, atoned for his great  fault, in the eyes of his judicious master; for, however much it called  for the severest reprehension, the fact of the mind not being hardened  to all sense of shame and right feeling, made the doctor anxious to  improve his better feelings; and, instead of driving them all away by  ill-timed severity, considering how lamentably the early training of  Ferrers had been neglected, he endeavored, after the first emotion  of indignation had passed away, to rouse the fallen youth to a  sense of honor and Christian responsibility; and sought to excite,  as far as he was able, some feeling of compassion for him among his  school-fellows.    There were, however, few among them who had learned the Christian  duty of bearing one another's burdens; few among them, who, because  circumstances over which"]]]
