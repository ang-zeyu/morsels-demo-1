[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],[0,"Pascal's Pens√©es (#18)"],[1,"there were three lives to gain, you would have  to play (since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would be  imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain  three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. But there  is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if there were  an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you, you would  still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act stupidly,  being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against three at a  game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if  there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. But there is  here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain  against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is  finite. It is all divided; wherever the infinite is and there is not an  infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no time to  hesitate, you must give all. And thus, when one is forced to play, he  must renounce reason to preserve his life, rather than risk it for  infinite gain, as likely to happen as the loss of nothingness.    For it is no use to say it is uncertain if we will gain, and it is  certain that we risk, and that the infinite distance between the  _certainty_ of what is staked and the _uncertainty_ of what will be  gained, equals the finite good which is certainly staked against the  uncertain infinite. It is not so, as every player stakes a certainty to  gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a finite certainty to gain a  finite uncertainty, without transgressing against reason. There is not  an infinite distance between the certainty staked and the uncertainty of  the gain; that is untrue. In truth, there is an infinity between the  certainty of gain and the certainty of loss. But the uncertainty of the  gain is proportioned to the certainty of the stake according to the  proportion of the chances of gain and loss. Hence it comes that, if  there are as many risks on one side as on the other, the course is to  play even; and then the certainty of the stake is equal to the  uncertainty of the gain, so far is it from fact that there is an  infinite distance between them. And so our proposition is of infinite  force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal  risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain. This is  demonstrable; and if men are capable of any truths, this is one.    \"I confess it, I admit it. But, still, is there no means of seeing the  faces of the cards?\"--Yes, Scripture and the rest, etc. \"Yes, but I have  my hands tied and my mouth closed; I am forced to wager, and am not  free. I am not released, and am so made that I cannot believe. What,  then, would you have me do?\"    True. But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings  you to this, and yet you cannot believe. Endeavour then to convince  yourself, not by increase of proofs of God, but by the abatement of your  passions. You would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you  would like to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it.  Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their  possessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow,  and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the way  by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy  water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you  believe, and deaden your acuteness.--\"But this is what I am afraid  of.\"--And why? What have you to lose?    But to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will lessen  the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks.    _The end of this discourse._--Now, what harm will befall you in taking  this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful, generous, a  sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not have those poisonous  pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you not have others? I will tell  you that you will thereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you  take on this road, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much  nothingness in what you risk, that you will at last recognise that you  have wagered for something certain and infinite, for which you have  given nothing.    \"Ah! This discourse transports me, charms me,\" etc.    If this discourse pleases you and seems impressive, know that it is  made by a man who has knelt, both before and after it, in prayer to that  Being, infinite and without parts, before whom he lays all he has, for  you also to lay before Him all you have for your own good and for His  glory, that so strength may be given to lowliness.      234    If we must not act save on a certainty, we ought not to act on religion,  for it is not certain. But how many things we do on an uncertainty, sea  voyages, battles! I say then we must do nothing at all, for nothing is  certain, and that there is more certainty in religion than there is as  to whether we may see to-morrow; for it is not certain that we may see  to-morrow, and it is certainly possible that we may not see it. We  cannot say as much about religion. It is not certain that it is; but who  will venture to say that it is certainly possible that it is not? Now  when we work for to-morrow, and so on an uncertainty, we act reasonably;  for we ought to work for an uncertainty according to the doctrine of  chance which was demonstrated above.    Saint Augustine has seen that we work for an uncertainty, on sea, in  battle, etc. But he has not seen the doctrine of chance which proves  that we should do so. Montaigne has seen that we are shocked at a fool,  and that habit is all-powerful; but he has not seen the reason of this  effect.    All these persons have seen the effects, but they have not seen the  causes. They are, in comparison with those who have discovered the  causes, as those who have only eyes are in comparison with those who  have intellect. For the effects are perceptible by sense, and the causes  are visible only to the intellect. And although these effects are seen  by the mind, this mind is, in comparison with the mind which sees the  causes, as the bodily senses are in comparison with the intellect.      235    _Rem viderunt, causam non viderunt._      236    According to the doctrine of chance, you ought to put yourself to the  trouble of searching for the truth; for if you die without worshipping  the True Cause, you are lost.--\"But,\" say you, \"if He had wished me to  worship Him, He would have left me signs of His will.\"--He has done so;  but you neglect them. Seek them, therefore; it is well worth it.      237    _Chances._--We must live differently in the world, according to these  different assumptions: (1) that we could always remain in it; (2) that  it is certain that we shall not remain here long, and uncertain if we  shall remain here one hour. This last assumption is our condition.      238    What do you then promise me, in addition to certain troubles, but ten  years of self-love (for ten years is the chance), to try hard to please  without success?      239    _Objection._--Those who hope for salvation are so far happy; but they  have as a counterpoise the fear of hell.    _Reply._--Who has most reason to fear hell: he who is in ignorance  whether there is a hell, and who is certain of damnation if there is; or  he who certainly believes there is a hell, and hopes to be saved if  there is?      240    \"I would soon have renounced pleasure,\" say they, \"had I faith.\" For my  part I tell you, \"You would soon have faith, if you renounced pleasure.\"  Now, it is for you to begin. If I could, I would give you faith. I  cannot do so, nor therefore test the truth of what you say. But you can  well renounce pleasure, and test whether what I say is true.      241    _Order._--I would have far more fear of being mistaken, and of finding  that the Christian religion was true, than of not being mistaken in  believing it true.          SECTION IV    OF THE MEANS OF BELIEF      242    _Preface to the second part._--To speak of those who have treated of  this matter.    I admire the boldness with which these persons undertake to speak of  God. In addressing their argument to infidels, their first chapter is to  prove Divinity from the works of nature.[91] I should not be astonished  at their enterprise, if they were addressing their argument to the  faithful; for it is certain that those who have the living faith in  their heart see at once that all existence is none other than the work  of the God whom they adore. But for those in whom this light is  extinguished, and in whom we purpose to rekindle it, persons destitute  of faith and grace, who, seeking with all their light whatever they see  in nature that can bring them to this knowledge, find only obscurity and  darkness; to tell them that they have only to look at the smallest  things which surround them, and they will see God openly, to give them,  as a complete proof of this great and important matter, the course of  the moon and planets, and to claim to have concluded the proof with such  an argument, is to give them ground for believing that the proofs of our  religion are very weak. And I see by reason and experience that nothing  is more calculated to arouse their contempt.    It is not after this manner that Scripture speaks, which has a better  knowledge of the things that are of God. It says, on the contrary, that  God is a hidden God, and that, since the corruption of nature, He has  left men in a darkness from which they can escape only through Jesus  Christ, without whom all communion with God is cut off. _Nemo novit  Patrem, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare._[92]    This is what Scripture points out to us, when it says in so many places  that those who seek God find Him.[93] It is not of that light, \"like the  noonday sun,\" that this is said."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#18)"],[1,"  inlays. Even the horses are decorated with artificial forelocks of hair  and beads. Strings of bells surround their necks, while saddles and  whips display the aesthetic taste of their owners.    A part of this decoration is apparently realistic and will readily be  identified by any member of the tribe; another part is suggestive and  with a widely known meaning, but by far the greater number of designs  have no generally accepted signification. The writer spent many hours  securing the names of the designs on textiles, ornaments, or on lime  boxes, only to receive the reply \"done to make pretty,\" or to find that  no two of five or a dozen informants could agree on many patterns, while  frequently it was found that some obliging individual had volunteered  names at one time which he could not remember on the day following. It  is possible that a long residence with the people and diligent inquiry  along this line might yield more definite results, but for the present  the writer must content himself by showing some typical examples of the  decorative art, and adding a few notes to the same.    The great majority of baskets lack in decoration, other than that which  can be obtained by a slight change in the weave. In these a central band  can be distinguished from those at top and bottom, although the same  material is used and there is only a minor variation in the technique.    Small carrying receptacles, or trinket baskets, frequently have designs  produced by plaiting the rattan or bamboo of natural color with that  which has been blackened (Plate XXXIVa). No uniform meaning or pattern  name seems to be attached to the designs shown in this specimen, but an  incised design on the wooden rim was readily identified as a crocodile.    The small baskets in the coiled weave sometimes have the fronts entirely  covered with beads which are woven into the basket in parallel lines.  The tobacco box shown in Plate XXXV has been covered with cloth and  pitch, in which an artistic design made from the yellow cuticle of an  orchid has been inlaid. Plate XXXVb shows the wooden tops of three  tobacco boxes. Nos. 1 and 2 are carved and inlaid with beads and buttons  in designs which \"look pretty,\" but number 3 depicts a hunting scene in  which two men and a dog are hunting the alligator. Several beads are  missing so that it requires quite a stretch of the imagination to secure  the impression the native artist meant to impart.    The prized trinket baskets of the women generally have the fronts  covered with cloth, to which hundreds of colored beads are sewed, in  elaborate designs (Plate XXXVI).    The patterns brought out in the weaving are as beautiful and intricate  as they are confusing. Five typical specimens of cloth used in women's  skirts are shown in Plate XXXVII. In them can be found several  apparently different designs to some of which names were assigned, but  as there was no agreement among my informers I refrain from giving them  here. The pattern marked X in (c) was generally identified as  \"alligator,\" yet the weavers were by no means agreed.    The strip of cloth (Plate XXXVIII) was intended for the center breadth  in a woman's skirt and shows the typical designs employed in the best  garments.    The extensive use of beads is shown in Plates XXXIX-XL. Carrying bags,  clothing, combs, necklaces, armlets, belts and sheath covers are  partially covered with or made up of colored beads, always in designs,  yet very few of these patterns have generally accepted meanings or  names. The same holds true of the designs in shell disks, which, on the  finer garments, take the place of beads. A few exceptions to this are  found in which realistic patterns appear in (Plate XXXIb and Fig. 34).    FIG. 34. REALISTIC PATTERNS IN BEADS AND SHELL DISKS.    Like the bead work, the embroidery and applique found on many garments  are added \"to make pretty.\" Some of this work is quite fine, but in  general that of recent years is either inferior to that found on old  garments or is borrowed from, or made by, the Bila-an women. Some  garments, with designs produced by oversewing before dyeing, are seen  here, but they are recent importations from the Kulaman or Tagakaolo  tribes.    Necklaces and leglets are made of rattan and are decorated with burned  lines or by being overlaid with platted strips of orchid and fern  cuticle (Fig. 2).    A few rare specimens, such as personal ornaments or basket rims, have  sewed in designs in which the sewing has been done with fern cuticle  (Plate XXXIVb).    Incised patterns appear on nearly all the bamboo lime and tobacco  holders, but here individual fancy plays such an important part that a  hundred specimens might be examined without finding duplicate patterns.  Fig. 14. shows nine of these tubes covered with cut-in designs, yet only  one figure, that marked X in _b_ could be identified. This was said to  be the familiar crocodile.    Coming to the work in brass and copper we encounter an entirely new type  of design. In some cases straight inlaid or overlaid strips and twisted  wires are used to ornament the specimen; while in the raised and cut-in  lines on the bells we find simple patterns. In the main, however, the  ornamentation on this class of material consists of complicated scrolls  (Plate XLI), designs suggesting flower or tree patterns, or  conventionalized figures. One only needs to compare these objects with  similar specimens from Borneo and the Malayan Islands of the South, to  find the source of this type of ornamentation.[53] In fact the imitation  of Moro wares is practiced today. In Plate XLIa and b are shown two  betel nut boxes--No. 1 the work of the Samal Moro, No. 2 the imitation of  the inlaid work on the top of the first specimen. This last was made in  my presence, and with the expressed intention of duplicating the Moro  box. However, in this case, as in all others, the Bagobo caster did not  attempt to exactly reproduce the work of another, but simply borrowed a  broad idea, and thus he often creates new forms.    [53] See LING ROTH, Oriental Silver Work.    Not once did the writer receive a name for any pattern or design shown  in metal work. A careful study of the method of work, of the articles  produced, and of the folk-lore and religious observances connected with  the work in brass and copper brings one to the conclusion that this  class of work is of comparatively recent introduction and that the  instructors in the art were the Samal Moro.    Mention has already been made of the designs incised on combs and other  objects which are afterwards filled with lime. Just here it is  interesting to note that, so far as is known, the southern end of  Mindanao and adjacent small islands, are the only parts of the  Philippines in which this decoration, so typical of Melanesia, is to be  found.    Realistic carvings were seen used in only two capacities. The first in  certain ceremonies, where extremely crude wooden figures were offered to  the spirits in exchange for the sick person (see p. 103), and the  second, the wooden decoys used in hunting doves (See Plate XVIII).    Summing up our present information we can say: first, that the Bagobo  makes use of certain realistic designs which in some cases have become  conventionalized but still retain their former significance; second,  that the greater part of decoration in beads, shell disks, embroidery or  applique, as well as the incised designs in lime boxes and the like,  have no meaning to the people of the present day, and are added only to  make the objects more beautiful in the eyes of the owners. In this work  there are no set patterns and each artist gives full reign to the fancy  in producing these figures. Third, that the ideas for the patterns  inlaid, incised, and cast in brass or copper, are furnished by the  examples of this work coming from the Malays to the south, but that even  in these the artist has taken great liberties in the execution of the  design. Fourth, that one type of decoration, i. e., the incised figures  filled with lime, suggests the possible influence of Melanesia on the  artistic ideas of this people.    MYTHOLOGY.    During my stay with this tribe I heard parts of many folk-tales, some  chanted, others told with gravity, and still others which caused the  greatest levity. My limited knowledge of the dialect and pressure of  other work caused me to delay the recording of these tales until I  should begin a systematic study of the language. Owing to unforeseen  circumstances, that time never came, and it is now possible to give only  the slightest idea of a very rich body of tales.[54]    [54] Since this was written MISS BENEDICT has published an excellent  collection of Bagobo Myths (_Journal of American Folklore_, 1913, XXVI.  pp. 13-63.)    In the main these stories are an attempt to account for the present  order of things. In the tale which we quoted in part, at the beginning  of the paper, we are told of an all-powerful being who created the earth  and all that is. Other spirits and many animals inhabited the sky and  earth which the creator had made. Of the latter only one, the monkey, is  named. He and his kind, we are told, once inhabited and owned all the  world, but were dispossessed by two human beings, Toglai and Toglibon,  from whom all the people of the world are descended. After their death a  great drought caused the people to disperse and seek out new homes in  other parts. They journeyed in pairs and because of the objects which  they carried with them, they are now known by certain names. One couple,  for instance, carried with them a small basket called _bira-an_, and for  this reason their children are known as Bira-an (Bila-an). From the time  of the dispersion until the arrival of the Spaniards we learn that  certain mythical heroes performed wonderful feats, in some cases being  closely identified with the spirits themselves, in others making"]]]
