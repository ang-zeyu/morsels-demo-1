That sentence must be a very  severe one.  It pains me much to see one who is yet so young, and whose  prospects in life were otherwise so excellent, brought to this  distressing condition by a constitution which I can only regard as  radically vicious; but yours is no case for compassion: this is not your  first offence: you have led a career of crime, and have only profited by  the leniency shown you upon past occasions, to offend yet more seriously  against the laws and institutions of your country.  You were convicted of  aggravated bronchitis last year: and I find that though you are now only  twenty-three years old, you have been imprisoned on no less than fourteen  occasions for illnesses of a more or less hateful character; in fact, it  is not too much to say that you have spent the greater part of your life  in a jail.    \"It is all very well for you to say that you came of unhealthy parents,  and had a severe accident in your childhood which permanently undermined  your constitution; excuses such as these are the ordinary refuge of the  criminal; but they cannot for one moment be listened to by the ear of  justice.  I am not here to enter upon curious metaphysical questions as  to the origin of this or that--questions to which there would be no end  were their introduction once tolerated, and which would result in  throwing the only guilt on the tissues of the primordial cell, or on the  elementary gases.  There is no question of how you came to be wicked, but  only this--namely, are you wicked or not?  This has been decided in the  affirmative, neither can I hesitate for a single moment to say that it  has been decided justly.  You are a bad and dangerous person, and stand  branded in the eyes of your fellow-countrymen with one of the most  heinous known offences.    \"It is not my business to justify the law: the law may in some cases have  its inevitable hardships, and I may feel regret at times that I have not  the option of passing a less severe sentence than I am compelled to do.  But yours is no such case; on the contrary, had not the capital  punishment for consumption been abolished, I should certainly inflict it  now.    \"It is intolerable that an example of such terrible enormity should be  allowed to go at large unpunished.  Your presence in the society of  respectable people would lead the less able-bodied to think more lightly  of all forms of illness; neither can it be permitted that you should have  the chance of corrupting unborn beings who might hereafter pester you.  The unborn must not be allowed to come near you: and this not so much for  their protection (for they are our natural enemies), as for our own; for  since they will not be utterly gainsaid, it must be seen to that they  shall be quartered upon those who are least likely to corrupt them.    \"But independently of this consideration, and independently of the  physical guilt which attaches itself to a crime so great as yours, there  is yet another reason why we should be unable to show you mercy, even if  we were inclined to do so.  I refer to the existence of a class of men  who lie hidden among us, and who are called physicians.  Were the  severity of the law or the current feeling of the country to be relaxed  never so slightly, these abandoned persons, who are now compelled to  practise secretly and who can be consulted only at the greatest risk,  would become frequent visitors in every household; their organisation and  their intimate acquaintance with all family secrets would give them a  power, both social and political, which nothing could resist.  The head  of the household would become subordinate to the family doctor, who would  interfere between man and wife, between master and servant, until the  doctors should be the only depositaries of power in the nation, and have  all that we hold precious at their mercy.  A time of universal  dephysicalisation would ensue; medicine-vendors of all kinds would abound  in our streets and advertise in all our newspapers.  There is one remedy  for this, and one only.  It is that which the laws of this country have  long received and acted upon, and consists in the sternest repression of  all diseases whatsoever, as soon as their existence is made manifest to  the eye of the law.  Would that that eye were far more piercing than it  is.    \"But I will enlarge no further upon things that are themselves so  obvious.  You may say that it is not your fault.  The answer is ready  enough at hand, and it amounts to this--that if you had been born of  healthy and well-to-do parents, and been well taken care of when you were  a child, you would never have offended against the laws of your country,  nor found yourself in your present disgraceful position.  If you tell me  that you had no hand in your parentage and education, and that it is  therefore unjust to lay these things to your charge, I answer that  whether your being in a consumption is your fault or no, it is a fault in  you, and it is my duty to see that against such faults as this the  commonwealth shall be protected.  You may say that it is your misfortune  to be criminal; I answer that it is your crime to be unfortunate.    \"Lastly, I should point out that even though the jury had acquitted you--a  supposition that I cannot seriously entertain--I should have felt it my  duty to inflict a sentence hardly less severe than that which I must pass  at present; for the more you had been found guiltless of the crime  imputed to you, the more you would have been found guilty of one hardly  less heinous--I mean the crime of having been maligned unjustly.    \"I do not hesitate therefore to sentence you to imprisonment, with hard  labour, for the rest of your miserable existence.  During that period I  would earnestly entreat you to repent of the wrongs you have done  already, and to entirely reform the constitution of your whole body.  I  entertain but little hope that you will pay attention to my advice; you  are already far too abandoned.  Did it rest with myself, I should add  nothing in mitigation of the sentence which I have passed, but it is the  merciful provision of the law that even the most hardened criminal shall  be allowed some one of the three official remedies, which is to be  prescribed at the time of his conviction.  I shall therefore order that  you receive two tablespoonfuls of castor oil daily, until the pleasure of  the court be further known.\"    When the sentence was concluded the prisoner acknowledged in a few  scarcely audible words that he was justly punished, and that he had had a  fair trial.  He was then removed to the prison from which he was never to  return.  There was a second attempt at applause when the judge had  finished speaking, but as before it was at once repressed; and though the  feeling of the court was strongly against the prisoner, there was no show  of any violence against him, if one may except a little hooting from the  bystanders when he was being removed in the prisoners' van.  Indeed,  nothing struck me more during my whole sojourn in the country, than the  general respect for law and order.          CHAPTER XII: MALCONTENTS      I confess that I felt rather unhappy when I got home, and thought more  closely over the trial that I had just witnessed.  For the time I was  carried away by the opinion of those among whom I was.  They had no  misgivings about what they were doing.  There did not seem to be a person  in the whole court who had the smallest doubt but that all was exactly as  it should be.  This universal unsuspecting confidence was imparted by  sympathy to myself, in spite of all my training in opinions so widely  different.  So it is with most of us: that which we observe to be taken  as a matter of course by those around us, we take as a matter of course  ourselves.  And after all, it is our duty to do this, save upon grave  occasion.    But when I was alone, and began to think the trial over, it certainly did  strike me as betraying a strange and untenable position.  Had the judge  said that he acknowledged the probable truth, namely, that the prisoner  was born of unhealthy parents, or had been starved in infancy, or had met  with some accidents which had developed consumption; and had he then gone  on to say that though he knew all this, and bitterly regretted that the  protection of society obliged him to inflict additional pain on one who  had suffered so much already, yet that there was no help for it, I could  have understood the position, however mistaken I might have thought it.  The judge was fully persuaded that the infliction of pain upon the weak  and sickly was the only means of preventing weakness and sickliness from  spreading, and that ten times the suffering now inflicted upon the  accused was eventually warded off from others by the present apparent  severity.  I could therefore perfectly understand his inflicting whatever  pain he might consider necessary in order to prevent so bad an example  from spreading further and lowering the Erewhonian standard; but it  seemed almost childish to tell the prisoner that he could have been in  good health, if he had been more fortunate in his constitution, and been  exposed to less hardships when he was a boy.    I write with great diffidence, but it seems to me that there is no  unfairness in punishing people for their misfortunes, or rewarding them  for their sheer good luck: it is the normal condition of human life that  this should be done, and no right-minded person will complain of being  subjected to the common treatment.  There is no alternative open to us.  It is idle to say that men are not responsible for their misfortunes.  What is responsibility?  Surely to be responsible means to be liable to  have to give an answer should it be demanded, and all things which live  are responsible for their lives and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#18)"],[1,"is composed of four hundred tombs of knights,  incrusted with jasper, porphyry, verd-antique, and precious stones of  various kinds, which should form the most splendid sepulchral mosaics  conceivable. I say should form, because at the moment of my visit, the  whole floor was covered with those immense mats, so constantly used for  carpeting the southern churches--a usage which is explained by the  absence of pews or chairs, and the habit of kneeling upon the floor to  perform one's devotions. I regretted this exceedingly; but the crypt and  the chapel contain enough sepulchral wealth to offer some atonement.          VIII    THE MAINLAND OF GREECE          ON ARRIVING IN ATHENS--THE ACROPOLIS[42]    BY J. P. MAHAFFY      There is probably no more exciting voyage, to any educated man, than the  approach to Athens from the sea. Every promontory, every island, every  bay, has its history. If he knows the map of Greece, he needs no  guide-book or guide to distract him; if he does not, he needs little  Greek to ask of any one near him the name of this or that object; and  the mere names are sufficient to stir up all his classical  recollections. But he must make up his mind not to be shocked at \"AEgina\"  or \"Phalrum,\" and even to be told that he is utterly wrong in his way of  pronouncing them.    It was our fortune to come into Greece by night, with a splendid moon  shining upon the summer sea. The varied outlines of Sunium, on the one  side, and AEgina on the other, were very clear, but in the deep shadows  there was mystery enough to feed the burning impatience of seeing all in  the light of common day; and tho we had passed AEgina, and had come over  against the rocky Salamis, as yet there was no sign of Peiraeus. Then  came the light on Psyttalea, and they told us that the harbor was right  opposite. Yet we came nearer and nearer, and no harbor could be seen.    The barren rocks of the coast seemed to form one unbroken line, and  nowhere was there a sign of indentation or of break in the land. But  suddenly, as we turned from gazing on Psyttalea, where the flower of the  Persian nobles had once stood in despair, looking upon their fate  gathering about them, the vessel had turned eastward, and discovered to  us the crowded lights and thronging ships of the famous harbor. Small it  looked, very small, but evidently deep to the water's edge, for great  ships seemed touching the shore; and so narrow is the mouth, that we  almost wondered how they had made their entrance in safety. But we saw  it some weeks later, with nine men-of-war towering above all its  merchant shipping and its steamers, and among them crowds of ferryboats  skimming about in the breeze with their wing-like sails. Then we found  out that, like the rest of Greece, the Peiraeus was far larger than it  looked.    It differed little, alas! from more vulgar harbors in the noise and  confusion of disembarking; in the delays of its custom-house; in the  extortion and insolence of its boatmen. It is still, as in Plato's day,  \"the haunt of sailors, where good manners are unknown.\" But when we had  escaped the turmoil, and were seated silently on the way to Athens,  almost along the very road of classical days, all our classical notions,  which had been seared away by vulgar bargaining and protesting,  regained their sway.    We had sailed in through the narrow passage where almost every great  Greek that ever lived had some time passed; now we went along the line,  hardly less certain, which had seen all these great ones going to and  fro between the city and the port. The present road is shaded with great  silver poplars, and plane trees, and the moon had set, so that our  approach to Athens was even more mysterious than our approach to the  Peiraeus. We were, moreover, perplexed at our carriage stopping under  some large plane trees, tho we had driven but two miles, and the night  was far spent. Our coachman would listen to no advice or persuasion. We  learned afterward that every carriage going to and from the Peiraeus  stops at this half-way house, that the horses may drink, and the  coachman take \"Turkish delight\" and water. There is no exception made to  this custom, and the traveler is bound to submit. At last we entered the  unpretending ill-built streets at the west of Athens....    We rose at the break of dawn to see whether our window would afford any  prospect to serve as a requital for angry sleeplessness. And there,  right opposite, stood the rock which of all rocks in the world's history  has done most for literature and art--the rock which poets, and orators,  and architects, and historians have ever glorified, and can not stay  their praise--which is ever new and ever old, ever fresh in its decay,  ever perfect in its ruin, ever living in its death--the Acropolis of  Athens.    When I saw my dream and longing of many years fulfilled, the first rays  of the rising sun had just touched the heights, while the town below was  still hid in gloom. Rock, and rampart, and ruined fanes--all were  colored in uniform tints; the lights were of a deep rich orange, and the  shadows of dark crimson, with the deeper lines of purple. There was no  variety in color between what nature and what man had set there. No  whiteness shone from the marble, no smoothness showed upon the hewn and  polished blocks; but the whole mass of orange and crimson stood out  together into the pale, pure Attic air. There it stood, surrounded by  lanes and hovels, still perpetuating the great old contrast in Greek  history, of magnificence and meanness--of loftiness and lowness--as well  in outer life as in inward motive. And, as it were in illustration of  that art of which it was the most perfect bloom, and which lasted in  perfection but a day of history, I saw it again and again, in sunlight  and in shade, in daylight and at night, but never again in this perfect  and singular beauty....    I suppose there can be no doubt whatever that the ruins on the Acropolis  of Athens are the most remarkable in the world. There are ruins far  larger, such as the Pyramids, and the remains of Karnak. There are ruins  far more perfectly preserved, such as the great Temple at Paestum. There  are ruins more picturesque, such as the ivy-clad walls of medieval  abbeys beside the rivers in the rich valleys of England. But there is no  ruin all the world over which combines so much striking beauty, so  distinct a type, so vast a volume of history, so great a pageant of  immortal memories. There is, in fact, no building on earth which can  sustain the burden of such greatness, and so the first visit to the  Acropolis is and must be disappointing.    When the traveler reflects how all the Old World's culture culminated in  Greece--all Greece in Athens--all Athens in its Acropolis--all the  Acropolis in the Parthenon--so much crowds upon the mind confusedly that  we look for some enduring monument whereupon we can fasten our thoughts,  and from which we can pass as from a visible starting-point into all  this history and all this greatness. And at first we look in vain. The  shattered pillars and the torn pediments will not bear so great a  strain; and the traveler feels forced to admit a sense of  disappointment, sore against his will. He has come a long journey into  the remoter parts of Europe; he has reached at last what his soul had  longed for many years in vain; and as is wont to be the case with all  great human longings, the truth does not answer to his desire. The pang  of disappointment is all the greater when he sees that the tooth of time  and the shock of earthquake have done but little harm. It is the hand of  man--of reckless foe and ruthless lover--which has robbed him of his  hope....    Nothing is more vexatious than the reflection, how lately these splendid  remains have been reduced to their present state. The Parthenon, being  used as a Greek church, remained untouched and perfect all through the  Middle Ages. Then it became a mosque, and the Erechtheum a seraglio, and  in this way survived without damage till 1687, when, in the bombardment  by the Venetians under Morosini, a shell dropt into the Parthenon, where  the Turks had their powder stored, and blew out the whole center of the  building. Eight or nine pillars at each side have been thrown down, and  have left a large gap, which so severs the front and rear of the temple,  that from the city below they look like the remains of two different  buildings. The great drums of these pillars are yet lying there, in  their order, just as they fell, and some money and care might set them  all up again in their places; yet there is not in Greece the patriotism  or even the common sense to enrich the country by this restoration,  matchless in its certainty as well as in its splendor.    But the Venetians were not content with their exploit. They were, about  this time, when they held possession of most of Greece, emulating the  Pisan taste for Greek sculptures; and the four fine lions standing at  the gate of the arsenal in Venice still testify to their zeal in  carrying home Greek trophies to adorn their capital.    In its great day, and even as Pausanias saw it, the Acropolis was  covered with statues, as well as with shrines. It was not merely an Holy  of Holies in religion; it was also a palace and museum of art. At every  step and turn the traveler met new objects of interest. There were  archaic specimens, chiefly interesting to the antiquarian and the  devotee; there were the great masterpieces which were the joint  admiration of the artist and the vulgar. Even all the sides and slopes  of the great rock were honeycombed into sacred grottos, with their  altars and their gods, or studded with votive monuments. All these  lesser things are fallen away and gone; the sacred eaves are filled with  rubbish, and desecrated with worse than neglect. The grotto of Pan and  Apollo is difficult of access, and when reached,"]]]
