Now I can tap a whiskey barrel    With nothing but a stick,    No one can detect me    I've got it down so slick;    Just fill it up with water,--    Sure, there's no harm in that.      Now my clothes are not the finest,    Nor are they genteel;    But they will have to do me    Till I can make another steal.    My boots are number elevens,    For I swiped them from a chow,    And my coat cost dos reals    From a little Apache squaw.      Now I have freighted in the sand,    I have freighted in the rain,    I have bogged my wagons down    And dug them out again;    I have worked both late and early    Till I was almost dead,    And I have spent some nights sleeping    In an Arizona bed.      Now barbed wire and bacon    Is all that they will pay,    But you have to show your copper checks    To get your grain and hay;    If you ask them for five dollars,    Old Meyers will scratch his pate,    And the clerks in their white, stiff collars    Say, \"Get down and pull your freight.\"      But I want to die and go to hell,    Get there before Livermore and Meyers,    And get a job of hauling coke    To keep up the devil's fires;    If I get the job of singeing them,    I'll see they don't get free;    I'll treat them like a yaller dog,    As they have treated me.          And it's home, dearest home;        And it's home you ought to be,        Over on the Gila,        In the white man's country,        Where the poplar and the ash        And mesquite will ever be        Growing green down on the Gila;        There's a home for you and me.          THE ARIZONA BOYS AND GIRLS        Come all of you people, I pray you draw near,    A comical ditty you all shall hear.    The boys in this country they try to advance    By courting the ladies and learning to dance,--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      The boys in this country they try to be plain,    Those words that you hear you may hear them again,    With twice as much added on if you can.    There's many a boy stuck up for a man,--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      They will go to their parties, their whiskey they'll    take,    And out in the dark their bottles they'll break;    You'll hear one say, \"There's a bottle around here;    So come around, boys, and we'll all take a share,\"--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      There is some wears shoes and some wears boots,    But there are very few that rides who don't shoot;    More than this, I'll tell you what they'll do,    They'll get them a watch and a ranger hat, too,--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      They'll go in the hall with spurs on their heel,    They'll get them a partner to dance the next reel,    Saying, \"How do I look in my new brown suit,    With my pants stuffed down in the top of my boot?\"--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      Now I think it's quite time to leave off these lads    For here are some girls that's fully as bad;    They'll trim up their dresses and curl up their hair,    And like an old owl before the glass they'll stare,--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      The girls in the country they grin like a cat,    And with giggling and laughing they don't know what they're at,    They think they're pretty and I tell you they're wise,    But they couldn't get married to save their two eyes,--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      You can tell a good girl wherever she's found;    No trimming, no lace, no nonsense around;    With a long-eared bonnet tied under her chin,--    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    And they're down, down, and they're down.      They'll go to church with their snuff-box in hand,    They'll give it a tap to make it look grand;    Perhaps there is another one or two    And they'll pass it around and it's \"Madam, won't you,\"--    And they're down, down, and they're down.      Now, I think it's quite time for this ditty to end;    If there's anyone here that it will offend,    If there's anyone here that thinks it amiss    Just come around now and give the singer a kiss,--    And they're down, down, and they're down.          THE DYING RANGER        The sun was sinking in the west    And fell with lingering ray    Through the branches of a forest    Where a wounded ranger lay;    Beneath the shade of a palmetto    And the sunset silvery sky,    Far away from his home in Texas    They laid him down to die.      A group had gathered round him,    His comrades in the fight,    A tear rolled down each manly cheek    As he bid a last good-night.    One tried and true companion    Was kneeling by his side,    To stop his life-blood flowing,    But alas, in vain he tried.      When to stop the life-blood flowing    He found 'twas all in vain,    The tears rolled down each man's cheek    Like light showers of rain.    Up spoke the noble ranger,    \"Boys, weep no more for me,    I am crossing the deep waters    To a country that is free.      \"Draw closer to me, comrades,    And listen to what I say,    I am going to tell a story    While my spirit hastens away.    Way back in Northwest Texas,    That good old Lone Star state,    There is one that for my coming    With a weary heart will wait.      \"A fair young girl, my sister,    My only joy, my pride,    She was my friend from boyhood,    I had no one left beside.    I have loved her as a brother,    And with a father's care    I have strove from grief and sorrov    Her gentle heart to spare.      \"My mother, she lies sleeping    Beneath the church-yard sod,    And many a day has passed away    Since her spirit fled to God.    My father, he lies sleeping    Beneath the deep blue sea,    I have no other kindred,    There are none but Nell and me.      \"But our country was invaded    And they called for volunteers;    She threw her arms around me,    Then burst into tears,    Saying, 'Go, my darling brother,    Drive those traitors from our shore,    My heart may need your presence,    But our country needs you more.'      \"It is true I love my country,    For her I gave my all.    If it hadn't been for my sister,    I would be content to fall.    I am dying, comrades, dying,    She will never see me more,    But in vain she'll wait my coming    By our little cabin door.      \"Comrades, gather closer    And listen to my dying prayer.    Who will be to her as a brother,    And shield her with a brother's care?\"    Up spake the noble rangers,    They answered one and all,    \"We will be to her as brothers    Till the last one does fall.\"      One glad smile of pleasure    O'er the ranger's face was spread;    One dark, convulsive shadow,    And the ranger boy was dead.    Far from his darling sister    We laid him down to rest    With his saddle for a pillow    And his gun across his breast.        The Dying Ranger (Mus. Not.)        The sun was sink-ing in  the west, And    fell with lin-g'ring ray Through the branches of the    for-est,... Where a wound-ed ran-ger lay;    'Neath the shade of a  pal-met-to ... And the    sun-set sil-v'ry sky, Far a-way from his home in    Tex-as,... They laid him down to  die.          THE FAIR FANNIE MOORE        Yonder stands a cottage,    All deserted and alone,    Its paths are neglected,    With grass overgrown;    Go in and you will see    Some dark stains on the floor,--    Alas! it is the blood    Of fair Fannie Moore.      To Fannie, so blooming,    Two lovers they came;    One offered young Fannie    His wealth and his name;    But neither his money    Nor pride could secure    A place in the heart    Of fair Fannie Moore.      The first was young Randell,    So bold and so proud,    Who to the fair Fannie    His haughty head bowed;    But his wealth and his house    Both failed to allure    The heart from the bosom    Of fair Fannie Moore.      The next was young Henry,    Of lowest degree.    He won her fond love    And enraptured was he;    And then at the altar    He quick did secure    The hand with the heart    Of the fair Fannie Moore.      As she was alone    In her cottage one day,    When business had called    Her fond husband away,    Young Randell, the haughty,    Came in at the door    And clasped in his arms    The fair Fannie Moore.      \"O Fannie, O Fannie,    Reflect on your fate    And accept of my offer    Before it's too late;    For one thing to-night    I am bound to secure,--    'Tis the love or the life    Of the fair Fannie Moore.\"      \"Spare me, Oh, spare me!\"    The young Fannie cries,    While the tears swiftly flow    From her beautiful eyes;    \"Oh, no!\" cries young Randell,    \"Go home to your rest,\"    And he buried his knife    In her snowy white breast.      So Fannie, so blooming,    In her bright beauty died;    Young Randell, the haughty,    Was taken and tried;    At length he was hung    On a tree at the door,    For shedding the blood    Of the fair Fannie Moore.      Young Henry, the shepherd,    Distracted and wild,    Did wander away    From his own native isle.    Till at length, claimed by death,    He was brought to this shore    And laid by the side    Of the fair Fannie Moore.          HELL IN TEXAS        The devil, we're told, in hell was chained,    And a thousand years he there remained;    He never complained nor did he groan,    But determined to start a hell of his own,    Where he could torment the souls of men    Without being chained in a prison pen.    So he asked the Lord if he had on hand    Anything left when he made the land.      The Lord said, \"Yes, I had plenty on hand,    But I left it down on the Rio Grande;    The fact is, old boy, the stuff is so poor    I don't think you could use it in hell anymore.\"    But the devil went down to look at the truck,    And said if it came as a gift he was stuck;    For after examining it carefully and well    He concluded the place was too dry for hell.

Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these hundred fathoms  are equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom being measured as  six feet or four cubits, the feet being four palms each, and the cubits  six. The water in the lake does not come from the place where it is, for  the country there is very deficient in water, but it has been brought  thither from the Nile by a canal; and for six months the water flows  into the lake, and for six months out into the Nile again; and whenever  it flows out, then for the six months it brings into the royal treasury  a talent of silver a day from the fish which are caught, and twenty  pounds when the water comes in. The natives of the place moreover said  that this lake had an outlet under ground to the Syrtis which is in  Libya, turning towards the interior of the continent upon the Western  side and running along by the mountain which is above Memphis. Now since  I did not see anywhere existing the earth dug out of this excavation  (for that was a matter which drew my attention), I asked those who dwelt  nearest to the lake where the earth was which had been dug out. These  told me to what place it had been carried away; and I readily believed  them, for I knew by report that a similar thing had been done at  Nineveh, the city of the Assyrians. There certain thieves formed a  design once to carry away the wealth of Sardanapallos son of Ninos, the  king, which wealth was very great and was kept in treasure-houses under  the earth. Accordingly they began from their own dwelling, and making  estimate of their direction they dug under ground towards the king's  palace; and the earth which was brought out of the excavation they used  to carry away, when night came on, to the river Tigris which flows by  the city of Nineveh, until at last they accomplished that which they  desired. Similarly, as I heard, the digging of the lake in Egypt was  effected, except that it was done not by night but during the day; for  as they dug the Egyptians carried to the Nile the earth which was dug  out; and the river, when it received it, would naturally bear it away  and disperse it. Thus is this lake said to have been dug out.    Now the twelve kings continued to rule justly, but in course of time it  happened thus:--After sacrifice in the temple of Hephaistos they  were about to make libation on the last day of the feast, and the  chief-priest, in bringing out for them the golden cups with which they  had been wont to pour libations, missed his reckoning and brought eleven  only for the twelve kings. Then that one of them who was standing last  in order, namely Psammetichos, since he had no cup took off from his  head his helmet, which was of bronze, and having held it out to receive  the wine he proceeded to make libation: likewise all the other kings  were wont to wear helmets and they happened to have them then. Now  Psammetichos held out his helmet with no treacherous meaning; but they  taking note of that which had been done by Psammetichos and of the  oracle, namely how it had been declared to them that whosoever of them  should make libation with a bronze cup should be sole king of Egypt,  recollecting, I say, the saying of the Oracle, they did not indeed deem  it right to slay Psammetichos, since they found by examination that he  had not done it with any forethought, but they determined to strip him  of almost all his power and to drive him away into the fen-country, and  that from the fen-country he should not hold any dealings with the  rest of Egypt. This Psammetichos had formerly been a fugitive from the  Ethiopian Sabacos who had killed his father Necos, from him, I say, he  had then been a fugitive in Syria; and when the Ethiopian had departed  in consequence of the vision of the dream, the Egyptians who were of the  district of Sais brought him back to his own country. Then afterwards,  when he was king, it was his fate to be a fugitive a second time  on account of the helmet, being driven by the eleven kings into the  fen-country. So then holding that he had been grievously wronged by  them, he thought how he might take vengeance on those who had driven  him out: and when he had sent to the Oracle of Leto in the city of Buto,  where the Egyptians have their most truthful Oracle, there was given to  him the reply that vengeance would come when men of bronze appeared from  the sea. And he was strongly disposed not to believe that bronze men  would come to help him; but after no long time had passed, certain  Ionians and Carians who had sailed forth for plunder were compelled to  come to shore in Egypt, and they having landed and being clad in bronze  armour, came to the fen-land and brought a report to Psammetichos that  bronze men had come from the sea and were plundering the plain. So he,  perceiving that the saying of the Oracle was coming to pass, dealt in a  friendly manner with the Ionians and Carians, and with large promises he  persuaded them to take his part. Then when he had persuaded them, with  the help of those Egyptians who favoured his cause and of these foreign  mercenaries he overthrew the kings. Having thus got power over all  Egypt, Psammetichos made for Hephaistos that gateway of the temple at  Memphis which is turned towards the South Wind; and he built a court for  Apis, in which Apis is kept when he appears, opposite to the gateway of  the temple, surrounded all with pillars and covered with figures; and  instead of columns there stand to support the roof of the court colossal  statues twelve cubits high. Now Apis is in the tongue of the Hellenes  Epaphos. To the Ionians and to the Carians who had helped him  Psammetichos granted portions of land to dwell in, opposite to  one another with the river Nile between, and these were called  \"Encampments\"; these portions of land he gave them, and he paid them  besides all that he had promised: moreover he placed with them Egyptian  boys to have them taught the Hellenic tongue; and from these, who learnt  the language thoroughly, are descended the present class of interpreters  in Egypt. Now the Ionians and Carians occupied these portions of land  for a long time, and they are towards the sea a little below the city of  Bubastis, on that which is called the Pelusian mouth of the Nile. These  men king Amasis afterwards removed from thence and established them at  Memphis, making them into a guard for himself against the Egyptians:  and they being settled in Egypt, we who are Hellenes know by intercourse  with them the certainty of all that which happened in Egypt beginning  from king Psammetichos and afterwards; for these were the first men of  foreign tongue who settled in Egypt: and in the land from which they  were removed there still remained down to my time the sheds where their  ships were drawn up and the ruins of their houses.    Thus then Psammetichos obtained Egypt: and of the Oracle which is in  Egypt I have made mention often before this, and now I give an account  of it, seeing that it is worthy to be described. This Oracle which is in  Egypt is sacred to Leto, and it is established in a great city near that  mouth of the Nile which is called Sebennytic, as one sails up the river  from the sea; and the name of this city where the Oracle is found is  Buto, as I have said before in mentioning it. In this Buto there is a  temple of Apollo and Artemis; and the temple-house of Leto, in which the  Oracle is, is both great in itself and has a gateway of the height of  ten fathoms: but that which caused me most to marvel of the things to be  seen there, I will now tell. There is in this sacred enclosure a house  of Leto made of one single stone upon the top, the cornice measuring  four cubits. This house then of all the things that were to be seen by  me in that temple is the most marvellous, and among those which come  next is the island called Chemmis. This is situated in a deep and broad  lake by the side of the temple at Buto, and it is said by the Egyptians  that this island is a floating island. I myself did not see it either  floating about or moved from its place, and I feel surprise at hearing  of it, wondering if it be indeed a floating island. In this island of  which I speak there is a great temple-house of Apollo, and three several  altars are set up within, and there are planted in the island many  palm-trees and other trees, both bearing fruit and not bearing fruit.  And the Egyptians, when they say that it is floating, add this story,  namely that in this island which formerly was not floating, Leto, being  one of the eight gods who came into existence first, and dwelling in the  city of Buto where she has this Oracle, received Apollo from Isis as a  charge and preserved him, concealing him in the island which is said now  to be a floating island, at that time when Typhon came after him seeking  everywhere and desiring to find the son of Osiris. Now they say that  Apollo and Artemis are children of Dionysos and of Isis, and that Leto  became their nurse and preserver; and in the Egyptian tongue Apollo is  Oros, Demeter is Isis, and Artemis is Bubastis. From this story and from  no other AEschylus the son of Euphorion took this which I shall say,  wherein he differs from all the preceding poets; he represented namely  that Artemis was the daughter of Demeter. For this reason then, they  say, it became a floating island.    Such is the story which they tell; but as for Psammetichos, he was king  over Egypt for four-and-fifty years, of which for thirty years save one  he was sitting before Azotos, a great city of Syria, besieging it, until  at last he took it: and this Azotos of all cities about which we have  knowledge held out for the longest time under a siege.    The son of Psammetichos was Necos, and he became king of Egypt. This man  was the first who attempted the channel leading to the Erythraian Sea,  which Dareios the"]]]
