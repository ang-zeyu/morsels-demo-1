Perhaps  he will tell us what is lacking.\"    So they went to the Dervish and asked him what he meant by saying to the  Sultan that the third mosque was not yet beautiful enough and they  begged him to tell them what it was that was lacking.    The Dervish fixed his eyes in the distance and slightly swaying his body  back and forth answered them in his sing-song tone.    \"The mosque is beautiful,\" he said, \"and the fountain in its midst is  beautiful, but where is the glorious Nightingale Gisar? With the  Nightingale Gisar singing beside the fountain, then indeed would the  Sultan's third mosque be the most beautiful mosque in the world!\"    \"Only tell us where this glorious Nightingale is,\" the brothers begged,  \"and we will get him if it costs us our lives!\"    \"I cannot tell you that,\" the Dervish droned. \"You will have to go out  into the world and find him for yourselves.\"    So the three brothers returned to the Sultan and told him what the  Dervish had said.    \"All your third mosque lacks to be the most beautiful mosque in the  world,\" they told him, \"is the Nightingale Gisar singing beside the  fountain. So grieve no more, father. We, your three sons, will go out  into the world in quest of this glorious bird and within a year's time  we will return with the bird in our hands if so be that it is anywhere  to be found in all the wide world.\"    The Sultan blessed them and they set forth the three of them, side by  side. They traveled together until they reached a place where three  roads branched. Upon the stone of the left-hand road nothing was  written. Upon the stone of the middle road was the inscription: _Who  goes this way returns_. The inscription on the third stone read: _Who  goes this way shall meet many dangers and may never return_.    \"Let us part here,\" the oldest brother said, \"and each take a separate  road. Then if all goes well, let us meet here again on this same spot  one year hence. As our father's oldest son it would be wrong for me to  run unnecessary risks, so I will take the left-hand road.\"    \"And I will take the middle road,\" the second brother cried.    The Youngest Brother laughed and said:    \"That leaves the dangerous road for me! Very well, brothers, that's the  very road I wish to take for why should I leave home if it were not to  have adventures! Farewell then until we meet again in one year's time.\"    The oldest traveled his safe road until he reached a city where he  became a barber. He asked every man whose head he shaved:    \"Do you know anything of the Nightingale Gisar?\"    He never found any one who had even heard of the bird, so after a time  he stopped asking.    The second brother followed the middle road to a city where he settled  down and opened a coffee-house.    \"Have you ever heard of a glorious Nightingale known as Gisar?\" he asked  at first of every traveler who came in and sipped his coffee. Not one of  them ever had and as time went by the second brother gradually stopped  even making inquiries.    The Youngest Brother who took the dangerous road came to no city at all  but to a far-off desolate place without houses or highways or farms.  Wild creatures hid in the brush and snakes glided in and out among the  rocks. One day he came upon a wild woman who was combing her hair with a  branch of juniper.    \"That isn't the way to comb your hair,\" the Youngest Brother said.  \"Here, let me show you.\"    He took his own comb and smoothed out all the tangles in the wild  woman's hair until she was comfortable and happy.    \"You have been very kind to me,\" she said. \"Now isn't there something I  can do for you in return?\"    \"I am looking for the Nightingale Gisar. If you know where that glorious  bird is, tell me and that will more than repay me.\"    But the wild woman had never heard of the Nightingale Gisar.    \"Only wild animals inhabit this desolate place,\" she said, \"and a few  wild people like me. The Nightingale Gisar is not here.\"    \"Then I must go farther,\" the Youngest Brother said.    This the wild woman begged him not to do.    \"Beyond these mountains,\" she said, \"is a wilder desert with fiercer  animals. Turn back while you can.\"    \"No,\" the Youngest Brother insisted, \"I'm going as God leads me.\"    So he left the wild woman and crossed the mountains. He went on and on  until he was footsore and weary. Then at last he came to the Tiger's  house.    The Tiger's wife met him.    \"Be off, young man!\" she warned him, \"or the Tiger when he comes home  will eat you!\"    \"No!\" said the Youngest Brother, \"now I'm here I'm going to stay for I  have a question to ask the Tiger.\"    The Tiger's wife was making bread. When the dough was ready to go into  the oven, she leaned over the glowing embers of the fire and began to  brush them aside with her body.    \"Stop!\" the Youngest Brother cried. \"You will burn yourself!\"    \"But how else can I brush aside the glowing embers?\" the Tiger's wife  asked.    \"I'll show you.\"    The Youngest Brother cut a branch from a tree outside and fashioned it  into a rough broom. Then he showed the Tiger's wife how to use it.    \"Ah!\" she said gratefully, \"before this always when I've baked bread  I've been sick for ten days afterwards. Now I shall be sick no more for  you have taught me how to use a broom. In return let me hide you in a  dark corner and when the Tiger comes home I'll tell him how kind you  have been and perhaps he will not eat you.\"    So she hid the Youngest Brother in a dark corner and when the Tiger  came home she met him and said:    \"See, I have baked bread to-day but I am not sick, for a youth has shown  me how I can brush aside the embers without burning myself.\"    The Tiger was overjoyed to hear that his wife had been able to bake  bread without being made sick and he swore to be a brother to him who  had taught her the use of a broom. So the Youngest Brother came out from  the dark corner where he was hiding and the Tiger made him welcome.    \"What are you doing wandering about in this wild country?\" the Tiger  asked.    \"I am searching for the Nightingale Gisar and I have come to you to ask  you if you can tell me where I can find that glorious bird.\"    The Tiger had never heard of the Nightingale Gisar but he thought that  his oldest brother the Lion might know.    \"Go straight on from here,\" he said, \"until you come to the Lion's  house. His old wife stands outside facing the house with her long thin  old dugs thrown over her shoulders. Go up to her from behind and take  her dugs and put them in your mouth and suck them and when she asks you  who you are, say: 'Don't you know me, old mother? I'm your oldest cub.'  Then she will lead you in to the Lion who is so old that his eyelids  droop. Prop them open and when he sees you he will tell you what he  knows.\"    So the Youngest Brother went on to the Lion's house and he found the  Lion's old wife standing outside as the Tiger said he would. He did all  the Tiger had told him to do and when the Lion's wife asked him who he  was, he said: 'Don't you know me, old mother? I'm your oldest cub.' Then  the Lion's old wife led him in to the Lion and he propped open the  Lion's drooping eyelids and asked about the Nightingale Gisar.    The old Lion shook his head.    \"I have never heard of the Nightingale Gisar. He has never sung in this  wild place. Turn back, young man, and seek him elsewhere. Beyond this is  a country of wilder creatures where you will only lose your life.\"    \"That is as God wills,\" the Youngest Brother said.    With that he bade the old Lion and his old wife farewell and pushed on  into the farther wilds. The mountains grew more and more rugged, the  plains more parched and barren, and the Youngest Son was hard put to it  to find food from day to day.    Once when he was crossing a desert three eagles swooped down upon him  and it was all he could do to fight them off. He slashed at them with  his sword and succeeded in cutting off the beak of one, a wing of  another, and a leg of the third. He put these three things in his bag as  trophies.    He came at last to a hut where an old woman was baking cakes on the  hearth.    \"God bless you, granny!\" he said. \"Can you give me a bite of supper and  shelter for the night?\"    The old woman shook her head.    \"My boy, you had better not stop here. I have three daughters and if  they were to come home and find you here, they'd kill you.\"    But the Youngest Brother insisted that he was not afraid and at last the  old woman let him stay. She hid him in the corner behind the firewood  and warned him to keep still.    Presently the three eagles whom he had maimed came flying into the hut.  The old woman put a bowl of milk on the table, the birds dipped in the  milk, and lo! their feather shirts opened and they stepped out three  maidens. One of them had lost her lips, one an arm, and the third a leg.    \"Ah!\" they cried to their mother, \"see what has befallen us! If only the  youth who maimed us would return the beak and the wing and the leg that  he hacked off, we would tell him anything he wants to know.\"    At that the Youngest Brother stepped out from behind the firewood and  said:    \"Tell me then where I can find the Nightingale Gisar and you shall have  back your beak and your wing and your leg.\"    He opened his bag and the maidens were overjoyed to see their beak and  their wing and their leg. Then they told the Youngest Brother all they  knew about the Nightingale Gisar.    \"Far from here,\" they said, \"there is a Warrior Princess, so beautiful  that men call her Flower o' the World. She has the Nightingale Gisar in  a golden cage hanging in her own chamber. The chamber door is guarded by  a lion and a wolf and a tiger for the Flower o' the World knows that she  will have to marry the man who steals from her the Nightingale Gisar.\"    \"How can a man enter the chamber of the Flower o' the World?\" the  Youngest Brother asked.    \"For a few moments at midnight,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#18)"],[1,"to charge the Austrian  squadron.\"    \"So he is!\" the king exclaimed, lowering his glass, for the  distance was little more than half a mile from the spot where he  stood. \"He must be mad.\"    \"It is possible he may do it, sire. His orderly is riding boot to  boot beside him. You know already that he is a good swordsman. He  will have the advantage that the enemy won't dream of his attacking  them, and the rate at which they are riding will help them through.    \"There he goes!\" and he raised the glass again to his eye. \"Bravo!  They are through the first troop, and still together. Now they are  at it.    \"There, sire, they are through the second troop. Bravo, Fergus!\"    The king made no remark until he saw the Austrian squadron draw  rein. Then he said:    \"Thank God, he has saved the cavalry! It was a glorious deed.  Marshal Keith, make out his commission as a captain, today.\"    \"He is very young, sire,\" the marshal said hesitatingly.    \"By Heaven, sir, I would promote him if he were an infant in arms!\"  the king replied. \"Why, Keith, the loss of half our cavalry would  have crippled us, and cavalry men are not made in a day.    \"There, he has reached them now. I see they are wheeling. Well and  quickly done! Yes, they won't be overtaken; but three minutes  later, and not a man would have come back.    \"Colonel Rogner,\" he said to one of the group of officers behind  him, \"you will please ride down and meet the cavalry, when they  come in, and convey to Lieutenant Drummond my highest satisfaction  at the gallant manner in which he has carried out my orders. You  will also inform General Gorlitz that, in my opinion, he pushed his  reconnaissance much too far; but that I am well content with the  bravery shown by the troops, and at the manner in which he drew  them off on receipt of my order.\"    In five-and-twenty minutes the colonel returned, and said:    \"I regret to say, your majesty, that Lieutenant Drummond is  missing. I have inquired among the officers and find that, as he  was following General Gorlitz, he and his horse suddenly pitched  forward and lay without movement. Evidently the horse was killed by  a cannon shot, but whether Mr. Drummond was also killed, they could  not say.\"    \"We must hope not,\" the king said warmly. \"I would not lose so  gallant a young officer, for a great deal.    \"Keith, if we take Lobositz today, let a most careful search be  made, over the ground the cavalry passed, for his body. If it is  found, so much the worse. If not, it will be a proof that he is  either wounded or unhurt, and that he has been carried off by the  Austrian cavalry; who passed over the same ground as ours, and who  certainly would not trouble themselves to carry off his body.\"        Chapter 6: A Prisoner.      The next morning a horse was brought round for Fergus, and he at  once started, under the escort of a captain and Lieutenant Kerr and  fifty troopers, with thirteen other officers taken prisoners at  Lobositz. Seven hundred rank and file had also been captured.  These, however, were to march under an infantry escort on the  following day. Fergus afterwards learned that sixteen officers, of  whom eleven belonged to the cavalry, had been killed; and  eighty-one officers and about eighteen hundred men wounded in the  desperate fighting at Lobositz.    Fergus found that among the Austrians the battle of the previous  day was considered a victory, although they had lost their advanced  post at Lobositz.    \"I cannot say it seemed so to me,\" he said to the lieutenant, as  they rode away from the camp.    \"Why, we have prevented the king from penetrating into Bohemia.\"    \"But the king could have done that three days ago, without fighting  a battle,\" Fergus said; \"just as Schwerin did at Koeniggraetz.  There would have been no need to have marched night and day across  the mountains, in order to give battle to an army nearly twice the  strength of his own. His object was to prevent you from drawing off  the Saxons, and in that he perfectly succeeded.\"    \"Oh, there are other ways of doing that! We had only to keep along  the other side of the Elbe until we faced Pirna, then they could  have joined us.\"    \"It sounds easy,\" Fergus laughed, \"but it would not be so easy to  execute. These mountain defiles are terrible, and you may be sure  that the king will not be idle while you and the Saxons are  marching to meet each other.    \"However, it was a hard-fought battle, and I should think that our  loss must be quite as great as yours; for your artillery must have  played terrible havoc among our infantry, as they marched to the  assault of the village.\"    \"Yes. I hear this morning that we have lost about a hundred and  twenty officers killed and wounded, and about two thousand one  hundred and fifty men, and nearly seven hundred missing or  prisoners. What your loss is, of course, I can't say.\"    \"I cannot understand your taking so many prisoners,\" Fergus said.    \"A great many of them belong to the cavalry. You see, all who were  dismounted by the fire of our guns were captured when our horse  swept down.\"    \"Ah, yes! I did not think of that. I saw a good many men running  across the plain when I galloped out.\"    Two of the officers belonged to the 3rd Royal Dragoon Guards, half  of which regiment had taken part in the reconnaissance; and both  their horses, like his own, had been shot under them. As soon as  they were brought up from the tents where they had been lodged,  they exchanged a cordial greeting with Fergus. He no longer  belonged to the regiment, as on his promotion he had been gazetted  from it on to the staff; but during the time he had drilled with  them, in Berlin, he had come to be well known to all of them.    \"I thought that it was you, lieutenant,\" one of them said. \"I was  not far from you, when you charged through those Austrians. I was  unhorsed as we went forward, and was running back when I saw them  come out. There were a good many of us, and I thought their object  was to capture us. It was no use running, and I threw myself down,  in hopes they would think I had been knocked over. You passed  within thirty yards of me. Our guns opened so heavily on them,  after you had got through, that I thought it prudent to keep quiet  a little longer before I made a move; and the result was that the  Austrian cavalry, as it came along in the pursuit of our men,  picked me up.    \"Do you know where we are bound for?\"    \"Prague in the first instance, but beyond that I cannot say. I  suppose it will depend a good deal on what takes place now. There  is no doubt the Saxons will have to surrender; and I suppose that,  anyhow, they will send us farther away, unless indeed there is an  exchange of prisoners.\"    A long day's ride took them to Prague. The news of the battle had  been sent off the night before, and as it had been reported as a  victory, the inhabitants were in a state of great delight. Bonfires  blazed in the streets, church bells rang in triumphant peals, and  the whole population was abroad. The arrival of this party, with  prisoners, afforded a welcome confirmation of the news.    There were a few yells and hoots, as they rode along in charge of  their escort; but as a rule the people stood silent, as if in  respect for their misfortunes, for most of the captives were  wounded. They were taken to the military prison, and comfortable  quarters assigned to them; and the wounds of those who required it  were redressed by a surgeon. There was a hearty parting between  Fergus and Kerr, as the latter, after handing over his prisoners,  turned to ride off with the escort to the barracks.    \"I start early tomorrow for the camp again,\" he said. \"If you are  kept here, I am sure to see you again before long.\"    Fergus shared a room with Captain Hindeman, an officer of the 3rd.    \"I don't think it at all likely we shall remain here,\" the latter  said. \"It is more probable that we shall be sent to Olmuetz, or to  one of the smaller fortresses in Moravia. The war is, they will  think, likely to be confined to Bohemia until the spring; if indeed  the king does not have to stand on the defensive. I cannot help  thinking, myself, that we should have done better if we had let  things go on quietly till the spring. It is not probable that  Russia and Austria would have been more ready, then, than they are  now; and we should have had the whole summer before us, and might  have marched to Vienna before the campaign was over. Now they will  all have the winter to make their preparations, and we shall have  France, Austria, and Russia, to say nothing of Poland, on our  hands. It is a tremendous job even for Frederick to tackle.\"    They remained for three weeks at Prague, and were then informed by  the governor that he had orders for them to be removed to Olmuetz.  Accordingly, the next day eight of the officers started on  horseback, under an escort. When they reached Bruenn they found  that they were to be separated, and the next morning Captain  Hindeman and Fergus were taken to the fortress of Spielberg.    \"An awkward place either to get in or out of, Drummond,\" the  captain said, as they approached the fortress.    \"Very much so,\" Fergus agreed. \"But if I see a chance, I shall  certainly do my best to escape before spring.\"    \"I don't think there is much chance of that,\" the other said  gloomily. \"If we had been left at Prague, or even at Bruenn, there  might have been some chance; but in these fortresses, where  everything is conducted on a very severe system, and they are  veritable prisons, I don't think that anything without wings has a  chance of getting away.\"    As a rule, officers taken prisoners in war enjoyed a considerable  amount of liberty; and were even allowed to reside in the houses of  citizens, on giving their parole. The enforced embodiment of the  Saxons in the Prussian army had, however, excited such a storm of  indignation throughout Europe that it"]]]
