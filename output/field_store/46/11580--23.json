The fish-hawk's nest will generally be at  the top of a dead tree where no one may disturb or look into it, though,  as the accompanying photograph shows, it is sometimes found on rocks  near the ground. The young hawks have a way of their own of defending  themselves from any climbing creature, and to investigators of the nest  the results are disastrously disagreeable as well as laughable. As the  intruder climbs near, the baby birds put their heads over the sides of  the nest and empty their stomachs upon him. This is vouched for by a  well-known writer who claims to have gone through the experience.    The female osprey is larger and stronger than the male. On slowly moving  wings she sails over the water, dropping suddenly to clutch in her  strong talons the fish her keen eyes have detected near the surface of  the water. Fish are fish to the osprey and salt waters or fresh are the  same to her. I have watched the bird plunge into the waves of the ocean,  on the coast of Maine, to bring out a cunner almost too large for her to  carry, and I have seen her drop into the placid waters of an Adirondack  lake for lake-trout in the same manner.      =Blue Heron=    The great blue heron is one of the shore folk and his metallic blue-gray  body gleams in the sunlight, as you sight him from your canoe, standing  tall and slim, a lonely figure on the bank. He flies slowly and  majestically, with his long legs streaming out behind. When out in a  small boat on Puget Sound a large heron escorted us some distance. As  we rowed near the shore he would fly ahead and then wait for us,  standing solemnly on a stone in the water or a partially submerged log,  to fly again as we approached.    [Illustration: The fish-hawk will sometimes build near the ground.]    This escort business seems to be a habit of the heron family, for the  same thing occurred on the Tomoca River, Fla., the home of the  alligator, when a small, brilliantly blue heron flew ahead of our boat  for several miles, always stopping to wait for us, and then going on  again.    The heron is a fisher and when you see him standing close to the water,  on one foot perhaps, he is awaiting his game. It matters not how long he  must remain immovable, there he will stand until the fish comes within  striking distance, when the long, curved neck will shoot out like a  snake and the strong beak grasp its unwary prey.      =Loon, Great Northern Diver=    Another interesting bird, which you may both hear and see on secluded  lakes, is the loon or great northern diver. I first heard the wild cry  of the loon, a lonesome and eerie sound, on Pine River Pond, a small  lake in the foot-hills of the White Mountains. There I saw the great  bird dive and disappear beneath the water to remain an alarmingly long  time, and then come up several hundred yards away, and rising, fly  slowly to the shore. It is always a matter for guessing when the loon  dives, for you can never tell where she will come up. This great diver  is a large black-and-white bird, about the size of a goose. The breast  is white, head black, and a white ring encircles its black neck. Its  beak is long, its legs very short and placed far back on the body. It is  essentially a water-bird, and on shore is both slow and awkward. I do  not think it possible to become very intimate with the loon, for it is  one of the wildest of our birds, and so suspicious it will allow no  close approach, but quiet watching will reveal many of its interesting  characteristics. Some one once found the nest of a loon and brought me a  little, downy, young one that I might try to tame it; but it lived only  a day or two in spite of all the devotion expended upon it, and its  wild, frightened cry was too pathetic to allow of another experiment of  the kind.      =Animals and Birds of the Open=    You will find that the wild life of the open differs in some respects  from that of the woods, though there will be the woodchuck, the rabbit,  the fox, and the hare in the fields and farm lands as well as in the  woods. The weasel, too, makes unwelcome visits to the farm, but besides  these there are other animals that are seldom or never found in the  woods.      =Field-Mouse=    There is the little field-mouse, a short-eared and short-tailed little  creature with a thick neck and of a red-brown color. It feeds on grain  and seeds, and when hard pressed for food will also eat the bark of  trees.      =Kangaroo-Rat, Jumping Mouse=    In the underbrush near a meadow and at the edges of thickets you may  possibly see, though they are not common, a diminutive animal, beautiful  in form and color and of most interesting habits. In the Southwest it is  called the kangaroo-rat, but North and East it is known as the jumping  mouse. The name kangaroo-rat is given because of its short fore legs,  strong hind legs, and the kangaroo-like leaps it makes. In temper it is  very unlike the ordinary rat; it does not bite and can be safely  handled, but will not live if kept in captivity.      =Pocket-Gopher=    The pocket-gopher lives and burrows in the fields. It is a mole-like  animal but much larger than the common mole. Its legs are short and its  front feet strong, with long nails for digging. The fur is soft and  silky and dark brown in color. Where the gopher is there may be found  the weasel, his greatest enemy. It should be an even fight between them,  for they are equally matched in ill-temper and savageness, and are near  of a size though the gopher is the heavier.      =Antelope=    On the great plains of the west you may still see the beautiful and  gentle antelope, though that animal is fast disappearing, while the  thieving coyote thrives and multiplies in the same region.      =Coyote, Prairie-Wolf=    The coyote, or prairie-wolf, is about the size of a large dog and  resembles one. Its color is gray, made by a mixture of black and white  hairs. It is a cowardly animal and not dangerous, but its contemptible  character could not prevent a wave of compassion that came over me when  I saw one poor creature caged in a wooden box and holding up the bloody  stump where its fore foot had been torn off by the cruel and barbarous  steel trap.      =Spermophile=    In the Middle West, especially in Indiana, the little spermophile,  sometimes called the ground-squirrel, is common and not afraid to  venture into the outskirts of a village. One variety wears spotted brown  and yellow stripes down its back, another is gray, but all are about  the size of a gray squirrel. On the western prairies are the comical  little prairie-dogs. You can see them sitting up on their haunches  watching the train as it carries you over the great plains.    [Illustration: Antelopes of the western plains.]      =Bobolink=    The birds of the open are varied and many. Most of the forest birds are  seen occasionally in the fields, but some birds make their homes in the  open. You will find the bobolink's nest in a hay-field or down among the  red clover. The bobolink of the north is a sweet singer and is pretty in  his black and white feathers with a touch of yellow at the back of his  head. There are creamy-yellow feathers down his back, too, but they are  not noticeable. When he goes south the male loses his pretty coat and,  clad like his mate in yellowish-brown, is known as the rice-bird because  he feeds on the rice crops. Here he is killed because he is considered a  robber, and eaten because he is considered a delicacy.      =Meadow-Lark=    Early spring trailing through the meadows will bring you the cheery song  of the meadow-lark: \"Spring-o-the-year!\" Stalk him carefully and you  will find a large brown bird with yellow breast and a black crescent on  his throat. The meadow-lark is about the size of a quail. He stands  erect when he sings, and he has a rather long beak. The nest can be  found, if you look for it, but is generally out of sight under a  loosened clod of earth or tuft of grass.      =Red-Winged Blackbird=    The red-winged blackbird with his sweet call of \"O-ka-lie,\" or  \"Ouchee-la-ree-e!\" you will also find on the meadows and marshes. He  builds his nest among the reeds and is one of the first of our spring  birds in the north.      =Song Sparrow=    The little song sparrow loves the open and the hot summer sunshine.  Trailing along a country road at midday, when most of the other birds  are still, you will find the song sparrow sitting on a rail fence  singing with undiminished enthusiasm.    To make friends with the birds provide food and water for them, then sit  down and wait quietly until they appear. Let them become accustomed to  seeing you sitting still every day for a while, then begin slow, careful  movements, gradually becoming more natural, and in time the birds will  allow you to walk among them as you please, if you are careful never to  frighten them. You can do this in camp; you can do it at home if you are  not living in a city. The trustful friendship of animals and birds opens  a new path of happiness and one that all girls should be able, in some  measure, to enjoy.          CHAPTER VII    WILD FOOD ON THE TRAIL    =Edible Fruits, Nuts, Roots, and Plants=      While wild foods gathered on the trail give a delightful variety to camp  fare, be advised and do not gather, still less eat, them unless you are  absolutely sure you know what they are and that they are not poisonous.  You must be able to identify a thing with certainty before tasting in  order to enjoy it in safety.

A circular letter arrived to-day from Aghadez, addressed to all the  Tuaricks, written by Mustapha Bey of Mourzuk, recommending them to  render us all necessary protection. It is dated back two months.  Probably this letter was written on account of the unfavourable  intelligence which reached Mourzuk respecting us. To-morrow, please God,  we start for Soudan.    _12th._--Thank God! we left our encampment of Chintagawna this morning.  And oh, most gracious God! give us a prosperous journey, and may we be  useful to ourselves and our fellow-creatures.    We started about eleven o'clock, and went on about three hours and  a-half. The day was very cool; the thermometer in the morning, at  sunrise, being only three degrees above the freezing-point. We expect to  see the water freeze on the high plains through which we are about to  pass, before arriving at Damerghou. Our encampment is a pleasant wady,  under a conical-formed rock of considerable elevation, perhaps 1500  feet. We are also in a high situation, some 1000 or more feet above the  level of the sea. There is near this rock a lower one of an oblong form,  its sides fluted with pillars; these columnar masses are basalt. Dr.  Overweg examined the rocks, and found the outer crust a new species of  rock, a sort of trachite or brachite; and the interior a sort of basalt,  or volcanic substance. The large rock is also of the same formation. Dr.  Barth ascended the large rock.    I am now told that I made a great mistake about the wording of the  circular letter of Mustapha Bey. This letter begins by thanking the  Tuaricks of Aheer for exterminating the Walad Suleiman! It then hints  broadly at the necessity for the Turks in Mourzuk and the Tuaricks of  Aheer being friends; and to maintain this friendship one important  condition is required--that they, the Tuaricks of Aheer, shall protect  all the merchants or other travellers passing through their country, and  coming from Mourzuk. In the event of their committing a bad action, the  Bey says he may be compelled to make reprisals; so it is quite clear the  letter is written entirely on our account, and perhaps is a preliminary  measure to making reprisals. _Nous verrons._ This letter is only  addressed to the people of Aheer.    If water be the sustaining and even the generative force of vegetation  in the desert, it is also the destruction of trees and herbage; for  along the line of the current of the wady are seen immense numbers of  dead and overthrown trees, torn from their roots by the force of the  water in the rainy season. En-Noor paid me a visit this afternoon, and  took a nap in my tent.    _13th._--We rose early, but did not start till about nine o'clock. This  was the coldest day we have yet experienced: the heavens were overcast  with clouds. We came five hours; our course irregular, but always  south-east; the track through wadys filled with the usual trees of the  tholukh species. Yesterday were seen numbers of large butterflies, but  to-day, on account of the cold, few. Flies innumerable follow the  caravan. The rocks were, as yesterday, many conic-formed, and others  rounded or appearing in ranges, like huge haycocks: granite, sandstone,  and trachite. We have in the distance before us, a peculiarly shaped  rock of considerable height, called _Mari_, in the midst of a range. We  are encamped in the bed of an immense broad valley, and camels are  feeding about in considerable numbers. The salt-caravan is very near. We  are not yet in the regular caravan route, _via_ Asoudee, but expect to  reach it after to-morrow. En-Noor has with him as a guest the principal  man of Aghadez, before mentioned. This man was once a slave, but by his  address has risen thus high, as the slaves frequently do in Turkey: so  widely do similar manners prevail. Many slaves in Soudan rise to the  highest consequence.    The _shonshona_ (or practice of scarifying the face or neck) prevails  everywhere in Bornou, Soudan, and all this part of Africa; the Tuaricks  and Fellatahs being the only people who abstain from this barbarous  practice. Each device of scarifying denotes the peculiar nation of the  blacks. I have now got three sketches of faces thus disfigured, and  shall get as many as I can.    The Mahommedans of the coast usually teach that this way of marking the  body is a sin, but nevertheless the black Muslims will not abandon the  peculiarities of their nation.    _14th._--Started early, but made only two hours and a-quarter, through  the expansive valleys of yesterday. Here we found the salt-caravan,  there being in this place abundance of room, herbage, and a large well,  all necessary for such an assembly of people and beasts. On the road we  put up a covey of partridges, and a splendid solitary bird, the _hobara_  of Soudan. Footprints of the hares and of the gazelle were observed _en  route_.    By this opportunity we have got a few dates from Bilma; but they are  very poor, some of them little better than dried wood. The salt-caravan  has nothing attractive. The salt is all tied up in small bales or  bundles, the outward wrapper being matting or platting of strips of the  leaves of the doom-palm, called by the people _kabba_. Our caravan  resembles the march of a wandering tribe, there being camels, sheep,  oxen, asses, dogs, with all the paraphernalia of tents, cooking  utensils, &c. Some of the animals are laden, some unladen, playing,  running, and skipping about. Then come the human animals, men, women,  and children of every age. Our own caravan is mostly composed of the  household and slaves of En-Noor, with two or three strangers. But now  all changes to the salt-caravan, and we shall probably be soon absorbed  in it.    Yesterday morning I observed the dawn of day, and witnessed a degree of  redness and red clouds, or, more poetically, rosy-tinted clouds, which I  never before observed in all the Sahara. Probably now the sky will  change to a colouring more like England. Sunset and sunrise in the  Sahara are essentially different from those of England, the colours in  the desert being exceedingly light and bright; and often in the summer  time, at daybreak, there is a full, blazing sun in the course of three  quarters of an hour; so that, that rich colouring of the summer's dawn  in England is never here observed.    I visited the salt-caravan, or that portion of it which belongs to  En-Noor. The salt is prepared in Bilma, by the Tibboos, in three  different manners. There is, first, the _canto_, a kind of pillar or  pedestal, about 16 inches high, and 3 or 4 broad in its widest part. As  to weight, 10 of these are a good camel-load, 8 a load for a small  camel, and 6 for a weak camel. Then there are two cakes, one of refined  salt and the other coarse. These coarse cakes are about 5 inches in  diameter, and the refined ones 7 inches, the former being about 3lbs.  and the latter 5lbs. in weight. When a caravan of Tuaricks arrive at  Bilma, they find the salt all ready for them, and they pay a barter for  it in this way,--a zekka of ghaseb is exchanged against twenty of the  coarse cakes; a zekka for six of the refined cakes, and three zekkas of  ghaseb for two of the pillars. Ghaseb appears to be the only staple  thing which the Tibboos receive for their salt; they may also take now  and then turkadias, or black turbans, and on the other side the Tuaricks  bring a few dates with them: the fruit, even those of the best quality,  are not very good or fine. This commerce of barter is managed almost  solely by the women: the men remain in their houses, whilst the women go  to the salt-pits or lakes, and transact this important business; but the  men do not run away, as is commonly reported. At least, so say the  Tuaricks. The supply of salt is inexhaustible. It is, probably, on  account of the weight of the salt, and the fatigue of the camels which  carry it, with the distance, that this commerce is not very profitable  to the Tuaricks; but this can only be ascertained in the markets of  Kanou, and other large cities of Soudan. There are only six months to  the rainy season, so I have just time to go to Sakkatou and return,  without waiting long at any of the intermediate places between Sakkatou  and Kuka.    Our encampment is under some rocks, where are seen the dens of lions. At  the mouth of these caves or holes are bones of animals and the dung of  the lions.    _15th._--I rose early, but we did not start till two hours after  sunrise. The caravan was a considerable time in loading. We have only  with us En-Noor's detachment of the salt-caravan, about 130 camels. We  may be quicker in our movements to-morrow. The first morning of starting  is always thus slow. We came to-day five hours: passed the picturesque  rock Mari, like a camel couchant, and entered after three hours the  Asoudee route, or the direct caravan route from Ghat to Damerghou,  through Aheer. Another detachment of the salt-caravan passed or crossed  us, and took another route to the east. Our course was always  southwards, now S.E. now S.W., through wadys filled with trees, mostly  tholukh and its varieties; the rocks were all granite. Aheer appears to  be a region essentially of granite, although here and there are volcanic  cones striking up, composed of basalt, or a variety of this stone. The  weather was very cloudy and cold, only a little warm in the middle of  the day. We have not come to water or wells for three days, because our  journeys are very short. To-day I saw, for the first time, the indigo  plant--_neela_ in Arabic, and _bala_ in Soudanese. I was glad to make  its acquaintance. It grows amongst the other herbage, and may be easily  confounded with it as a common herb. It is now in seed, the pods being  small and very hard. This is one of the products"]]]
