If I have upon occasion presumed to say any thing concerning  their _Medicinal_ properties, it has been _Modestly_ and Frugally, and  with chief, if not only respect to the poor _Wood-man_, whom none I  presume will envy, that living far from the _Physician_, he should in case  of _Necessity_, consult the reverend _Druid_, his{lxxxv:1} _Oaks_ and his  _Elm_, _Birch_, or _Elder_, for a short _Breath_, a Green _Wound_, or a  sore _Leg_; Casualties incident to this hard _Labour_. These are the chief  _Particulars_ of this ensuing _Work_, and what it pretends hitherto of  _Singular_, in which let me be permitted to say, There is sufficient for  _Instruction_, and more than is extant in any _Collection_ whatsoever  (_absit verbo invidia_) in this way and upon this _Subject_; abstracting  things _Practicable_, of solid _use_ and _material_, from the  _Ostentation_ and Impertinences of divers _Writers_; who receiving all  that came to hand on trust, to swell their monstrous _Volumes_, have  hitherto impos'd upon the credulous _World_, without _conscience_ or  _honesty_. I will not exasperate the _Adorers_ of our ancient and late  _Naturalists_, by repeating of what our _Verulam_ has justly pronounced  concerning their _Rhapsodies_ (because I likewise honour their painful  _Endeavours_, and am obliged to them for much of that I know,) nor will I  (with some) reproach _Pliny_, _Porta_, _Cardan_, _Mizaldus_, _Cursius_,  and many others of great _Names_ (whose _Writings_ I have diligently  consulted) for the _Knowledge_ they have imparted to me on this Occasion;  but I must deplore the time which is (for the most part) so miserably lost  in pursuit of their _Speculations_, where they treat upon this _Argument_:  But the _World_ is now advis'd, and (blessed be _God_) infinitely redeem'd  from that base and servile submission of our noblest _Faculties_ to their  blind _Traditions_. This you will be apt to say, is a haughty _Period_;  but whilst I affirm it of the _Past_, it _justifies_, and does _honour_  to the _Present_ Industry of our _Age_, and of which there cannot be a  _greater_ and more emulous _Instance_, than the _Passion_ of His _Majesty_  to encourage his _Subjects_, and of the _Royal Society_, (His _Majesty's  Foundation_) who receive and promote His _Dictates_, in all that is  laudable and truly _emolumental_ of this Nature.    It is not therefore that I here presume to instruct _Him_ in the  management of that great and august _Enterprise_ of resolving to _Plant_  and repair His ample _Forests_, and other _Magazines_ of _Timber_, for  the benefit of His _Royal Navy_, and the glory of His _Kingdoms_; but to  present to His _Sacred Majesty_, and to the _World_, what _Advices_ I  have received from _others_, observed my self, and most industriously  _collected_ from a studious Propensity to serve as one of the least  _Intelligences_ in the ampler _Orb_ of our _Illustrious Society_, and in  a _Work_ so necessary and important.    And now since I mention'd the _Society_, give me leave (Worthy Reader)  as a _Member_ of that _Body_, which has been the chief _Promoter_ of  this ensuing _Work_, (and, as I stand oblig'd) to _vindicate_ that  _Assembly_, and consequently, the _Honour_ of his _Majesty_ and the  _Nation_, in a _Particular_ which concerns it, though (in appearance) a  little forreign to the present _Subject_.    I will not say that _all_ which I have written in the several  _Paragraphs_ of this _Treatise_, is _New_; but that there are very many  _New_, and _useful_ things, and _Observations_ (without insisting on the  _Methods_ only) not hitherto deliver'd by any _Author_, and so freely  communicated, I hope will sufficiently appear: It is not therefore in  behalf of any Particular which concerns _my self_, that I have been  induced to enlarge this _Preface_; but, by taking this _Occasion_, to  encounter the unsufferable _Boldness_, or _Ambition_ of some _Persons_  (as well _Strangers_, as others) _arrogating_ to themselves the being  _Inventors_ of divers _New_ and useful _Experiments_, justly  attributable to several _Members_ of the _Royal Society_.{lxxxvii:1}    So far has that _Assembly_ been from affecting _Glory_, that they seem  rather to have declin'd their due; not as asham'd of so numerous and  fair an _Off-spring_; but as abundantly satisfied, that after all the  hard measure, and virulent _Reproaches_ they had sustain'd, for  endeavouring by _united Attempts_, and at their own _Charges_, to  improve _Real Philosophy_; they had from time to time, cultivated that  _Province_ in so many _useful_ and profitable _Instances_, as are  already _published_ to the _World_, and will be easily _asserted_ to  their _Authors_ before all _equitable_ Judges.    This being the sole inducement of publishing this _Apology_; it may not  perhaps seem unseasonable to _disabuse_ some (otherwise) _well-meaning_  People, who _led away_ and _perverted_ by the _Noise_ of a few  _Ignorant_ and _Comical Buffoons_, (whose _Malevolence_, or  _Impertinencies_ intitle them to nothing that is truly _Great_ and  _Venerable_) are with an _Insolence_ suitable to their _Understanding_,  still crying out, and asking, _What have the Society done?_    Now, as nothing less than _Miracles_ (and unless _God_ should every day  _repeat_ them at the _Call_ of these _Extravagants_) will _convince_  some Persons, of the most _Rational_ and _Divine Truths_, (already so  often and extraordinarily establish'd;) so, nor will any thing  _satisfie_ these _unreasonable_ Men, but the production of the  _Philosophers-stone_, and _Great-Elixir_; which yet were they  _Possessors_ of, they would _consume_ upon their _Lux_ and _Vanity_.    It is not therefore to gratifie these _magnificent Fops_, whose  _Talents_ reach but to the adjusting of their _Peruques_, courting a  _Miss_, or at the farthest writing a smutty, or scurrilous _Libel_,  (which they would have to pass for _genuine_ Wit) that I _concern_ my  self in these _papers_; but, as well in _Honour_ of our _Royal Founder_,  as the _Nation_, to _Assert_ what of other _Countries_ has been  surreptitiously _Arrogated_, and by which, they not only value  themselves _abroad_; but (prevailing on the Modesty of that Industrious  _Assembly_) seek the _deference_ of _those_, who whilst it remains still  _silent_, do not so clearly discern this glorious _Plumage_ to be purely  _ascititious_, and not a _Feather_ of their own. --But still, _What have  they done?_    Those who perfectly comprehend the _Scope_, and _End_ of that noble  _Institution_; which is to _improve Natural Knowledge_, and inlarge the  _Empire_ of _Operative Philosophy_; not by an _Abolition_ of the _Old_,  but by the _Real Effects_ of the _Experimental_; _Collecting_,  _Examining_, and _Improving_ their scatter'd _Phaenomena_, to establish  even the _Received Methods_ and _Principles_ of the _Schools_ (as far as  were consistent with _Truth_, and _matter_ of _Fact_) thought it long  enough, that the World had been _impos'd_ upon by that _Notional_, and  _Formal_ way of delivering divers _Systems_ and _Bodies_ of  _Philosophie_ (falsely so call'd) beyond which there was no more  _Country_ to discover; which being brought to the _Test_ and _Tryal_,  vapours all away in _Fume_, and empty _Sound_.    This _Structure_ then being thus _Ruinous_ and _Crazy_; 'tis obvious  what they were to do; even the same which skilful _Architects_ do every  day before us; by _pulling down_ the decay'd and sinking Wall to erect a  _better_, and more _substantial_ in its place: They not only take down  the _old_, reject the useless and decay'd; but sever such _Materials_ as  are _solid_, and will serve again; bring _new-ones_ in, prepare and  frame a _Model_ suitable to so _magnificent_ a _Design_: This _Solomon_  did in order to the _Building_ of the _Material Temple_; and _this_ is  here to be pursued in the _Intellectual_: Nay, here was abundance of  _Rubbish_ to be clear'd, that the _Area_ might be free; and then was the  _Foundation_ to be deeply searched, the _Materials_ accurately  _examined_, _squared_, and _adjusted_, before it could be laid: Nor was  this the _Labour_ of a _Few_; less than a much longer time, more Cost  and Encouragement than any which the _Society_ has yet met withal, could  in reason be sufficient effectually to go through so chargeable a Work,  and highly necessary.    A long time it was they had been surveying the _Decays_, of what was  ready now to drop in pieces, whatever shew the out-side made with a  noise of _Elements_ and _Qualities_, _Occult_ and _Evident_; abhorrence  of _Vacuum_, _Sympathies_, _Antipathies_; _Substantial Forms_, and  _Prime matter_ courting _Form_; _Epicycles_, _Ptolemaean Hypotheses_,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#18)"],[1,"ring, the meritorious sacrifice, the holocaust, the smoke of which  rises to God. If they were not voluntary, there would be no merit in her  sins.    CALLICRATES. Does anyone know, Zenothemis in what country, under what  name, in what adorable form, this ever-renascent Helen is living now?    ZENOTHEMIS. A man would have to be very wise indeed to discover such a  secret. And wisdom, Callicrates, is not given to poets, who live in the  rude world of forms and amuse themselves, like children, with sounds and  empty shows.    CALLICRATES. Beware of offending the gods, impious Zenothemis; the poets  are dear to them. The first laws were dictated in verse by the immortals  themselves, and the oracles of the gods are poems. Hymns have a pleasant  sound to celestial ears. Who does not know that the poets are prophets,  and that nothing is hidden from them? Being a poet myself, and crowned  with Apollo's laurel, I will make known to all the last incarnation of  Eunoia. The eternal Helen is close to us; she is looking at us, and we  are looking at her. You see that woman reclining on the cushions of her  couch--so beautiful and so contemplative--whose eyes shed tears, and  whose lips abound with kisses! It is she! Lovely as in the time of Priam  and the halcyon days of Asia, Eunoia is now called Thais.    PHILINA. What do you say, Callicrates? Our dear Thais knew Paris,  Menelaus, and the Achaians who fought before Ilion! Was the Trojan horse  big, Thais?    ARISTOBULUS. Who speaks of a horse?    \"I have drunk like a Thracian!\" cried Chereas and he rolled under the  table.    Callicrates, raising his cup, cried--    \"If we drink like desperate men, we die unavenged!\"    Old Cotta was asleep, and his bald head nodded slowly above his broad  shoulders.    For some time past Dorion had seemed to be greatly excited under his  philosophic cloak. He reeled up to the couch of Thais.    \"Thais, I love you, although it is unseemly in me to love a woman.\"    THAIS. Why did you not love me before?    DORION. Because I had not supped.    THAIS. But I, my poor friend, have drunk nothing but water; therefore  you must excuse me if I do not love you.    Dorion did not wait to hear more, but made towards Drosea, who had made  a sign to him in order to get him away from her friend. Zenothemis took  the place he had left, and gave Thais a kiss on the mouth.    THAIS. I thought you more virtuous.    ZENOTHEMIS. I am perfect, and the perfect are subject to no laws.    THAIS. But are you not afraid of sullying your soul in a woman's arms?    ZENOTHEMIS. The body may yield to lust without the soul being concerned.    THAIS. Go away! I wish to be loved with body and soul. All these  philosophers are old goats.    The lamps died out one by one. The pale rays of dawn, which entered  between the openings of the hangings, shone on the livid faces and  swollen eyes of the guests. Aristobulus was sleeping soundly by the side  of Chereas, and, in his dreams, devoting all his grooms to the ravens.  Zenothemis pressed in his arms the yielding Philina; Dorion poured on  the naked bosom of Drosea drops of wine, which rolled like rubies on the  white breast, which was shaking with laughter, and the philosopher  tried to catch these drops with his lips, as they rolled on the slippery  flesh. Eucrites rose, and placing his arm on the shoulder of Nicias, led  him to the end of the hall.    \"Friend,\" he said, smiling, \"if you can still think at all--of what are  you thinking?\"    \"I think that the love of women is like a garden of Adonis.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"Do you not know, Eucrites, that women make little gardens on the  terraces, in which they plant boughs in clay pots in honour of the lover  of Venus? These boughs flourish a little time, and then fade.\"    \"What does that signify, Nicias? That it is foolish to attach importance  to that which fades?\"    \"If beauty is but a shadow, desire is but a lightning flash. What  madness it is, then, to desire beauty! Is it not rational, on the  contrary, that that which passes should go with that which does not  endure, and that the lightning should devour the gliding shadow?\"    \"Nicias, you seem to me like a child playing at knuckle-bones. Take my  advice--be free! By liberty only can you become a man.\"    \"How can a man be free, Eucrites, when he has a body?\"    \"You shall see presently, my son. Presently you will say, 'Eucrites was  free.'\"    The old man spoke, leaning against a porphyry pillar, his face lighted  by the first rays of dawn. Hermodorus and Marcus had approached, and  stood before him by the side of Nicias; and all four, regardless of the  laughter and cries of the drinkers, conversed on things divine. Eucrites  expresses himself so wisely and eloquently, that Marcus said--    \"You are worthy to know the true God.\"    Eucrites replied--    \"The true God is in the heart of the wise man.\"    Then they spoke of death.    \"I wish,\" said Eucrites, \"that it may find me occupied in correcting  my faults, and attentive to all my duties. In the face of death I will  raise my pure hands to heaven, and I will say to the gods, 'Your  images, gods, that you have placed in the temple of my soul, I have not  profaned; I have hung there my thoughts, as well as garlands, fillets,  and wreaths. I have lived according to your providence. I have lived  enough.'\"    Thus speaking, he raised his arms to heaven, and he remained thoughtful  a moment. Then he continued, with extreme joy--    \"Separate thyself from life, Eucrites, like the ripe olive which falls;  returning thanks to the tree which bore thee, and blessing the earth,  thy nurse.\"    At these words, drawing from the folds of his robe a naked dagger, he  plunged it into his breast.    Those who listened to him sprang forward to seize his hand, but the  steel point had already penetrated the heart of the sage. Eucrites had  already entered into his rest. Hermodorus and Nicias bore the pale and  bleeding body to one of the couches, amidst the shrill shrieks of the  women, the grunts of the guests disturbed in their sleep, and the heavy  breathing of the couples hidden in the shadow of the tapestry. Cotta,  an old soldier, who slept lightly, woke, approached the corpse, examined  the wound, and cried--    \"Call Aristaeus, my physician!\"    Nicias shook his head.    \"Eucrites is no more,\" he said. \"He wished to die as others wish to  love. He has, like all of us, obeyed his inexpressible desire. And, lo,  now he is like unto the gods, who desire nothing.\"    Cotta struck his forehead.    \"Die! To want to die when he might still serve the State! What  nonsense!\"    Paphnutius and Thais remained motionless and mute, side by side, their  souls overflowing with disgust, horror, and hope.    Suddenly the monk seized the hand of the actress, and stepping over the  drunkards, who had fallen close to the lascivious couples, and treading  in the wine and blood spilt upon the floor, he led her out of the house.        The sun had risen over the city. Long colonnades stretched on both sides  of the deserted street, and at the end shone the dome of Alexander's  tomb. Here and there on the pavement lay broken wreaths and extinguished  torches. Fresh wafts of the sea could be felt in the air. Paphnutius,  with a look of disgust, tore off his rich robe and trampled the  fragments under his feet.    \"Thou hast heard them, my Thais!\" he cried. \"They have spat forth every  sort of folly and abomination. They dragged the Divine Creator of all  things down the gemonies(*) of the devils of hell, impudently denied the  existence of Good and Evil, blasphemed Jesus, and exalted Judas. And the  most infamous of all, the jackal of darkness, the stinking beast, the  Arian full of corruption and death, opened his mouth like a yawning  sepulchre. My Thais, thou hast seen these filthy snails crawling towards  thee and defiling thee with their sticky sweat; thou hast seen others,  like brutes, sleeping under the heels of their slaves; thou hast seen  them coupling like beasts on the carpet they had fouled with their  vomit; thou hast seen a foolish old man shed a blood yet viler than  the wine which flowed at his debauch, and at the end of the orgie throw  himself in the face of the unforeseen Christ. Praise be to God! Thou  hast seen error and recognised how hideous it was. Thais, Thais, Thais,  recall to mind the follies of these philosophers, and say if thou wilt  go mad with them! Remember the looks, the gestures, the laughs of their  fitting companions, those two lascivious and malicious strumpets, and  say if thou wilt remain like unto them.\"         (*) Steps on the Aventine Hill, leading to the Tiber, to       which the bodies of executed criminals were dragged to be       thrown into the river. The word is now obsolete, but was       employed by Ben Jonson (Sejanus) and Massinger (The Roman       Actor).--TRANS.    Thais, her heart stirred with horror and disgust at all she had seen  and heard that night, and feeling the indifference and brutality, the  malicious jealousy of women, the heavy weight of useless hours, sighed.    \"I am weary to death, O my father! Where shall I find rest? I feel  that my face is burning, my head empty, and my arms are so tired that I  should not have the strength to seize happiness were it within reach of  my hand.\"    Paphnutius gazed at her with loving pity.    \"Courage, O my sister! The hour of rest rises for thee, white and pure  as the vapours thou seest rise from the gardens and waters.\"    They were near the house of Thais, and could see, above the wall, the  tops of the sycamore and fir trees, which surrounded the Grotto of  Nymphs, tremble in the morning breeze. In front of them was a public  square, deserted, and surrounded with steles and votive statues, and  having at each end a semicircular marble seat, supported by figures of  monsters. Thais fell on one of these seats. Then, looking anxiously at  the monk, she asked-- "]]]
