For although the grace of God is secured through Christ, and  sanctification is wrought by the Holy Ghost through the Word of God in  the unity of the Christian Church, yet on account of our flesh which we  bear about with us we are never without sin.    Everything, therefore, in the Christian Church is ordered to the end  that we shall daily obtain there nothing but the forgiveness of sin  through the Word and signs, to comfort and encourage our consciences as  long as we live here. Thus, although we have sins, the [grace of the]  Holy Ghost does not allow them to injure us, because we are in the  Christian Church, where there is nothing but [continuous,  uninterrupted] forgiveness of sin, both in that God forgives us, and in  that we forgive, bear with, and help each other.    But outside of this Christian Church, where the Gospel is not, there is  no forgiveness, as also there can be no holiness [sanctification].  Therefore all who seek and wish to merit holiness [sanctification], not  through the Gospel and forgiveness of sin, but by their works, have  expelled and severed themselves [from this Church].    Meanwhile, however, while sanctification has begun and is growing  daily, we expect that our flesh will be destroyed and buried with all  its uncleanness, and will come forth gloriously, and arise to entire  and perfect holiness in a new eternal life. For now we are only half  pure and holy, so that the Holy Ghost has ever [some reason why] to  continue His work in us through the Word, and daily to dispense  forgiveness, until we attain to that life where there will be no more  forgiveness, but only perfectly pure and holy people, full of godliness  and righteousness, removed and free from sin, death, and all evil, in a  new, immortal, and glorified body.    Behold, all this is to be the office and work of the Holy Ghost, that  He begin and daily increase holiness upon earth by means of these two  things, the Christian Church and the forgiveness of sin. But in our  dissolution He will accomplish it altogether in an instant, and will  forever preserve us therein by the last two parts.    But the term Auferstehung des Fleisches (resurrection of the flesh)  here employed is not according to good German idiom. For when we  Germans hear the word Fleisch (flesh), we think no farther than of the  shambles. But in good German idiom we would say Auferstehung des  Leibes, or Leichnams (resurrection of the body). However, it is not a  matter of much moment, if we only understand the words aright.    This, now, is the article which must ever be and remain in operation.  For creation we have received; redemption, too, is finished. But the  Holy Ghost carries on His work without ceasing to the last day. And for  that purpose He has appointed a congregation upon earth by which He  speaks and does everything. For He has not yet brought together all His  Christian Church nor dispensed forgiveness. Therefore we believe in Him  who through the Word daily brings us into the fellowship of this  Christian Church, and through the same Word and the forgiveness of sins  bestows, increases, and strengthens faith in order that when He has  accomplished it all, and we abide therein, and die to the world and to  all evil, He may finally make us perfectly and forever holy; which now  we expect in faith through the Word.    Behold, here you have the entire divine essence, will, and work  depicted most exquisitely in quite short and yet rich words wherein  consists all our wisdom, which surpasses and exceeds the wisdom, mind,  and reason of all men. For although the whole world with all diligence  has endeavored to ascertain what God is, what He has in mind and does,  yet has she never been able to attain to [the knowledge and  understanding of] any of these things. But here we have everything in  richest measure; for here in all three articles He has Himself revealed  and opened the deepest abyss of his paternal heart and of His pure  unutterable love. For He has created us for this very object, that He  might redeem and sanctify us; and in addition to giving and imparting  to us everything in heaven and upon earth, He has given to us even His  Son and the Holy Ghost, by whom to bring us to Himself. For (as  explained above) we could never attain to the knowledge of the grace  and favor of the Father except through the Lord Christ, who is a mirror  of the paternal heart, outside of whom we see nothing but an angry and  terrible Judge. But of Christ we could know nothing either, unless it  had been revealed by the Holy Ghost.    These articles of the Creed, therefore, divide and separate us  Christians from all other people upon earth. For all outside of  Christianity, whether heathen, Turks, Jews, or false Christians and  hypocrites, although they believe in, and worship, only one true God,  yet know not what His mind towards them is, and cannot expect any love  or blessing from Him; therefore they abide in eternal wrath and  damnation. For they have not the Lord Christ, and, besides, are not  illumined and favored by any gifts of the Holy Ghost.    From this you perceive that the Creed is a doctrine quite different  from the Ten Commandments; for the latter teaches indeed what we ought  to do, but the former tells what God does for us and gives to us.  Moreover, apart from this, the Ten Commandments are written in the  hearts of all men; the Creed, however, no human wisdom can comprehend,  but it must be taught by the Holy Ghost alone. The latter doctrine [of  the Law], therefore makes no Christian, for the wrath and displeasure  of God abide upon us still, because we cannot keep what God demands of  us; but this [namely, the doctrine of faith] brings pure grace, and  makes us godly and acceptable to God. For by this knowledge we obtain  love and delight in all the commandments of God, because here we see  that God gives Himself entire to us, with all that He has and is able  to do, to aid and direct us in keeping the Ten Commandments -- the  Father, all creatures; the Son, His entire work; and the Holy Ghost,  all His gifts.    Let this suffice concerning the Creed to lay a foundation for the  simple, that they may not be burdened, so that, if they understand the  substance of it, they themselves may afterwards strive to acquire more,  and to refer to these parts whatever they learn in the Scriptures, and  may ever grow and increase in richer understanding. For as long as we  live here, we shall daily have enough to do to preach and to learn  this.    Part Third. OF PRAYER.     The Lord's Prayer.    We have now heard what we must do and believe, in which things the best  and happiest life consists. Now follows the third part, how we ought to  pray. For since we are so situated that no man can perfectly keep the  Ten Commandments, even though he have begun to believe, and since the  devil with all his power together with the world and our own flesh,  resists our endeavors, nothing is so necessary as that we should  continually resort to the ear of God, call upon Him, and pray to Him,  that He would give, preserve, and increase in us faith and the  fulfillment of the Ten Commandments, and that He would remove  everything that is in our way and opposes us therein. But that we might  know what and how to pray, our Lord Christ has Himself taught us both  the mode and the words, as we shall see.    But before we explain the Lord's Prayer part by part, it is most  necessary first to exhort and incite people to prayer, as Christ and  the apostles also have done. And the first matter is to know that it is  our duty to pray because of God's commandment. For thus we heard in the  Second Commandment: Thou shalt not take the name of the lord, thy God,  in vain, that we are there required to praise that holy name, and call  upon it in every need, or to pray. For to call upon the name of God is  nothing else than to pray. Prayer is therefore as strictly and  earnestly commanded as all other commandments: to have no other God,  not to kill, not to steal, etc. Let no one think that it is all the  same whether he pray or not, as vulgar people do, who grope in such  delusion and ask Why should I pray? Who knows whether God heeds or will  hear my prayer? If I do not pray, some one else will. And thus they  fall into the habit of never praying, and frame a pretext, as though we  taught that there is no duty or need of prayer, because we reject false  and hypocritical prayers.    But this is true indeed that such prayers as have been offered  hitherto when men were babbling and bawling in the churches were no  prayers. For such external matters, when they are properly observed,  may be a good exercise for young children, scholars, and simple  persons, and may be called singing or reading, but not really praying.  But praying, as the Second Commandment teaches, is to call upon God in  every need. This He requires of us, and has not left it to our choice.  But it is our duty and obligation to pray if we would be Christians, as  much as it is our duty and obligation to obey our parents and the  government; for by calling upon it and praying the name of God is  honored and profitably employed. This you must note above all things,  that thereby you may silence and repel such thoughts as would keep and  deter us from prayer. For just as it would be idle for a son to say to  his father, \"Of what advantage is my obedience? I will go and do what  I can; it is all the same\"; but there stands the commandment, Thou  shalt and must do it, so also here it is not left to my will to do it  or leave it undone, but prayer shall and must be offered at the risk of  God's wrath and displeasure.    This is therefore to be understood and noted before everything else, in  order that thereby we may silence and repel the thoughts which would  keep and deter us from praying, as though it were not of much  consequence if we do not pray, or as though it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#18)"],[1,"had no more business there than they.\"  I was hasty to get to the gate then, and said no more to her; by which  means she got away. But just as I came to the gate, I saw two more  coming across the yard, to come out, with hats also on their heads and  under their arms; at which I threw the gate to behind me, which, having  a spring lock, fastened itself. And turning to the women, \"Forsooth,\"  said I, \"what are you doing here?\" and seized upon the hats, and took  them from them. One of them, who, I confess, did not look like a thief,  \"Indeed,\" says she, \"we are wrong; but we were told they were goods that  had no owner: be pleased to take them again. And look yonder: there are  more such customers as we.\" She cried, and looked pitifully: so I took  the hats from her, and opened the gate, and bade them begone, for I  pitied the women indeed. But when I looked towards the warehouse, as she  directed, there were six or seven more, all women, fitting themselves  with hats, as unconcerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter's  shop buying for their money.    I was surprised, not at the sight of so many thieves only, but at the  circumstances I was in; being now to thrust myself in among so many  people, who for some weeks I had been so shy of myself, that, if I met  anybody in the street, I would cross the way from them.    They were equally surprised, though on another account. They all told me  they were neighbors; that they had heard any one might take them; that  they were nobody's goods; and the like. I talked big to them at first;  went back to the gate and took out the key, so that they were all my  prisoners; threatened to lock them all into the warehouse, and go and  fetch my lord mayor's officers for them.    They begged heartily, protested they found the gate open, and the  warehouse door open, and that it had no doubt been broken open by some  who expected to find goods of greater value; which indeed was reasonable  to believe, because the lock was broke, and a padlock that hung to the  door on the outside also loose, and not abundance of the hats carried  away.    At length I considered that this was not a time to be cruel and  rigorous; and besides that, it would necessarily oblige me to go much  about, to have several people come to me, and I go to several, whose  circumstances of health I knew nothing of; and that, even at this time,  the plague was so high as that there died four thousand a week; so that,  in showing my resentment, or even in seeking justice for my brother's  goods, I might lose my own life. So I contented myself with taking the  names and places where some of them lived, who were really inhabitants  in the neighborhood, and threatening that my brother should call them to  an account for it when he returned to his habitation.    Then I talked a little upon another footing with them, and asked them  how they could do such things as these in a time of such general  calamity, and, as it were, in the face of God's most dreadful judgments,  when the plague was at their very doors, and, it may be, in their very  houses, and they did not know but that the dead cart might stop at their  doors in a few hours, to carry them to their graves.    I could not perceive that my discourse made much impression upon them  all that while, till it happened that there came two men of the  neighborhood, hearing of the disturbance, and knowing my brother (for  they had been both dependents upon his family), and they came to my  assistance. These being, as I said, neighbors, presently knew three of  the women, and told me who they were, and where they lived, and it seems  they had given me a true account of themselves before.    This brings these two men to a further remembrance. The name of one was  John Hayward, who was at that time under-sexton of the parish of St.  Stephen, Coleman Street (by under-sexton was understood at that time  gravedigger and bearer of the dead). This man carried, or assisted to  carry, all the dead to their graves, which were buried in that large  parish, and who were carried in form, and, after that form of burying  was stopped, went with the dead cart and the bell to fetch the dead  bodies from the houses where they lay, and fetched many of them out of  the chambers and houses; for the parish was, and is still, remarkable,  particularly above all the parishes in London, for a great number of  alleys and thoroughfares, very long, into which no carts could come,  and where they were obliged to go and fetch the bodies a very long way,  which alleys now remain to witness it; such as White's Alley, Cross Keys  Court, Swan Alley, Bell Alley, White Horse Alley, and many more. Here  they went with a kind of handbarrow, and laid the dead bodies on, and  carried them out to the carts; which work he performed, and never had  the distemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it, and was  sexton of the parish to the time of his death. His wife at the same time  was a nurse to infected people, and tended many that died in the parish,  being for her honesty recommended by the parish officers; yet she never  was infected, neither.[146]    He never used any preservative against the infection other than holding  garlic and rue[147] in his mouth, and smoking tobacco. This I also had  from his own mouth. And his wife's remedy was washing her head in  vinegar, and sprinkling her head-clothes so with vinegar as to keep them  always moist; and, if the smell of any of those she waited on was more  than ordinary offensive, she snuffed vinegar up her nose, and sprinkled  vinegar upon her head-clothes, and held a handkerchief wetted with  vinegar to her mouth.    It must be confessed, that, though the plague was chiefly among the  poor, yet were the poor the most venturous and fearless of it, and went  about their employment with a sort of brutal courage: I must call it so,  for it was founded neither on religion or prudence. Scarce did they use  any caution, but ran into any business which they could get any  employment in, though it was the most hazardous; such was that of  tending the sick, watching houses shut up, carrying infected persons to  the pesthouse, and, which was still worse, carrying the dead away to  their graves.    It was under this John Hayward's care, and within his bounds, that the  story of the piper, with which people have made themselves so merry,  happened; and he assured me that it was true. It is said that it was a  blind piper; but, as John told me, the fellow was not blind, but an  ignorant, weak, poor man, and usually went his rounds about ten o'clock  at night, and went piping along from door to door. And the people  usually took him in at public houses where they knew him, and would give  him drink and victuals, and sometimes farthings; and he in return would  pipe and sing, and talk simply, which diverted the people; and thus he  lived. It was but a very bad time for this diversion while things were  as I have told; yet the poor fellow went about as usual, but was almost  starved: and when anybody asked how he did, he would answer, the dead  cart had not taken him yet, but that they had promised to call for him  next week.    It happened one night that this poor fellow, whether somebody had given  him too much drink or no (John Hayward said he had not drink in his  house, but that they had given him a little more victuals than ordinary  at a public house in Coleman Street), and the poor fellow having not  usually had a bellyful, or perhaps not a good while, was laid all along  upon the top of a bulk or stall, and fast asleep at a door in the street  near London Wall, towards Cripplegate; and that, upon the same bulk or  stall, the people of some house in the alley of which the house was a  corner, hearing a bell (which they always rung before the cart came),  had laid a body really dead of the plague just by him, thinking too that  this poor fellow had been a dead body as the other was, and laid there  by some of the neighbors.    Accordingly, when John Hayward with his bell and the cart came along,  finding two dead bodies lie upon the stall, they took them up with the  instrument they used, and threw them into the cart; and all this while  the piper slept soundly.    From hence they passed along, and took in other dead bodies, till, as  honest John Hayward told me, they almost buried him alive in the cart;  yet all this while he slept soundly. At length the cart came to the  place where the bodies were to be thrown into the ground, which, as I do  remember, was at Mountmill; and, as the cart usually stopped some time  before they were ready to shoot out the melancholy load they had in it,  as soon as the cart stopped, the fellow awaked, and struggled a little  to get his head out from among the dead bodies; when, raising himself up  in the cart, he called out, \"Hey, where am I?\" This frighted the fellow  that attended about the work; but, after some pause, John Hayward,  recovering himself, said, \"Lord bless us! There's somebody in the cart  not quite dead!\" So another called to him, and said, \"Who are you?\" The  fellow answered, \"I am the poor piper. Where am I?\"--\"Where are you?\"  says Hayward. \"Why, you are in the dead cart, and we are going to bury  you.\"--\"But I ain't dead, though, am I?\" says the piper; which made them  laugh a little, though, as John said, they were heartily frightened at  first. So they helped the poor fellow down, and he went about his  business.    I know the story goes, he set up[148] his pipes in the cart, and  frighted the bearers and others, so that they ran away; but John Hayward  did not tell the story so, nor say anything of his piping at all. But  that he was a poor piper, and that he was carried away as above, I am  fully satisfied of the truth of.    It is to be noted here that the dead carts in the city were not confined  to particular parishes; but one cart went through several parishes,  according as the number "]]]
