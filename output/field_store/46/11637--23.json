[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#18)"],[1,"  Men, they say, but pray for children--riches, or a generous friend,      To assist them in misfortune--and a wife for the same end.      The whole race (the wise declare it)--thou the increaser of thy race,      Than the single self less precious--ever holds a second place.      Let me then discharge the duty--and preserve thyself by me,      Give me thine assent, all-honoured--and my children's guardian be.      Women must be spared from slaughter--this the learn'd in duty say,      Even the giant knows that duty--me he will not dare to slay.      Of the man the death is certain--of the woman yet in doubt,      Wherefore, noblest, on the instant--as the victim send me out.      I have lived with many blessings--I have well fulfilled my part,      I have given thee beauteous offspring--death hath nought t' appal mine          heart.      I've borne children, I am aged--in my soul I've all revolved,      And with spirit strong to serve thee--I am steadfast and resolved.      Offering me, all-honoured husband--thou another wife wilt find,      And to her wilt do thy duty--gentle as to me, and kind.      Many wives if he espouses--man incurs nor sin nor blame,      For a wife to wed another--'tis inexpiable shame.      This well weighed within thy spirit--and the sin thyself to die,      Save thyself, thy race, thy children--be the single victim I.           *       *       *       *       *        Hearing thus his wife, the husband--fondly clasp'd her to his breast,      And their tears they poured together--by their mutual grief oppressed.          THIRD SONG.          Of these two the troubled language--in the chamber as she heard,      Lost herself in grief the daughter--thus took up the doleful word.        _The_ DAUGHTER _spake_.        Why to sorrow thus abandoned?--weep not thus, as all forlorn,      Hear ye now my speech, my parents--and your sorrows may be borne.      Me with right ye may abandon--none that right in doubt will call,      Yield up her that best is yielded--I alone may save you all.      Wherefore wishes man for children?--they in need mine help will be:      Lo, the time is come, my parents--in your need find help in me.      Ever here the son by offering--or hereafter doth atone,      Either way is he th' atoner--hence the wise have named him son.        Daughters too, the great forefathers--of a noble race desire,      And I now shall prove their wisdom--saving thus from death my sire.      Lo, my brother but an infant!--to the other world goest thou,      In a little time we perish--who may dare to question how?      But if first depart to heaven--he that after me was born,      Cease our race's sacred offerings--our offended sires would mourn.      Without father, without mother--of my brother too bereft,      I shall die, unused to sorrow--yet to deepest sorrow left.      But thyself, my sire! my mother--and my gentle brother save,      And their meet, unfailing offerings--shall our fathers' spirits have.      A second self the son, a friend the wife--the daughter's but a grief,      From thy grief thy daughter offering--thou of right wilt find relief.      Desolate and unprotected--ever wandering here and there,      Shall I quickly be, my father!--reft of thy paternal care!      But wert thou through me, my father--and thy race from peril freed,      Noble fruit should I have borne thee--having done this single deed.      But if thou from hence departing-leav'st me, noblest, to my fate,      Down I sink to bitterest misery--save, Oh save me from that state!      For mine own sake, and for virtue's--for our noble race's sake,      Yield up her who best is yielded--me thine own life's ransom make.      Instantly this step, the only--the inevitable take.      Hath the world a fate more wretched--than when thou to heaven art fled,      Like a dog to wander begging--and subsist on others' bread.      But my father, thus preserving--thus preserving all that's thine,      I shall then become immortal--and partake of bliss divine,      And the gods, and our forefathers--all will hail the prudent choice,      Still will have the water offerings--that their holy spirits rejoice.           *       *       *       *       *        As they heard her lamentation--in their troubled anguish deep,      Wept the father, wept the mother--'gan the daughter too to weep.      Then the little son beheld them--and their doleful moan he heard;      And with both his eyes wide open--lisped he thus his broken word.      \"Weep not father, weep not mother--Oh my sister, weep not so!\"      First to one, and then to th' other--smiling went he to and fro.      Then a blade of spear-grass lifting--thus in bolder glee he said,      \"With this spear-grass will I kill him--this man-eating giant dead.\"      Though o'erpowered by bitterest sorrow--as they heard their prattling boy,      Stole into the parents' bosoms--mute and inexpressive joy.          THE DELUGE.          The following extract from the Mahabharata was published by      Bopp, with a German translation, (the promised Latin version      has not yet reached this country,) with four other extracts      from the same poem. It is inserted here not on account of its      poetical merit, but on account of the interest of the      subject. It is the genuine, and probably the earliest,      version of the Indian tradition of the Flood. The author has      made the following observations on this subject in the      Quarterly Review, which he ventures here to transcribe.        Nothing has thrown so much discredit on oriental studies,      particularly on the valuable Asiatic Researches, as the fixed      determination to find the whole of the Mosaic history in the      remoter regions of the East. It was not to be expected that,      when the new world of oriental literature was suddenly      disclosed, the first attempts to explore would be always      guided by cool and dispassionate criticism. Even Sir W. Jones      was led away, at times, by the ardour of his imagination; and      the gorgeous palaces of the Mahabadian dynasty, which were      built on the authority of the Desatir and the Dabistan, and      thrown upward into an age anterior even to the earliest      Indian civilisation, have melted away, and 'left not a wreck      behind,' before the cooler and more profound investigations      of Mr. Erskine[157]. Sir W. Jones was succeeded by Wilford, a      man of most excursive imagination, bred in the school of      Bryant, who, even if he had himself been more deeply versed      in the ancient language, would have been an unsafe guide. But      Wilford, it is well known, unfortunately betrayed to the      crafty and mercenary pundits whom he employed, the objects      which he hoped to find; and these unscrupulous interpreters,      unwilling to disappoint their employer, had little difficulty      in discovering, or forging, or interpolating, whatever might      suit his purpose. The honest candour with which Wilford, a      man of the strictest integrity, made the open and humiliating      confession of the deceptions which had been practised upon      him, ought for ever to preserve his memory from disrespect.      The fictions to which he had given currency, only retained,      and still we are ashamed to say retain, their ground in      histories of the Bible and works of a certain school of      theology, from which no criticism can exorcise an error once      established: still, however, with sensible men, a kind of      suspicion was thrown over the study itself; and the cool and      sagacious researches of men, probably better acquainted with      their own language than some of the Brahmins themselves, were      implicated in the fate of the fantastic and, though      profoundly learned, ever injudicious reveries of Wilford.        Now, however, that we may depend on the genuineness of our      documents, it is curious to examine the Indian version or      versions of the universal tradition of the Deluge; for,      besides this extract from the Mahabharata, Sir W. Jones had      extracted from the Bhagavata Purana another, and, in some      respects, very different legend. Both of these versions are      strongly impregnated with the mythological extravagance of      India; but the Purana, one of the Talmudic books of Indian      tradition, as M. Bopp observes, is evidently of a much later      date than the ruder and simpler fable of the old Epic. It      belongs to a less ancient school of poetry, and a less      ancient system of religion. While it is much more exuberant      in its fiction, it nevertheless betrays a sort of      apprehension lest it shall shock the less easy faith of a      more incredulous reader; it is manifestly from the religious      school of the follower of Vishnu, and, indeed, seems to have      some reference to one of the philosophic systems. Yet the      outline of the story is the same. In the Mahabharatic      version, Manu, like Noah, stands alone in an age of universal      depravity. His virtues, however, are of the Indian cast--the      most severe and excruciating penance by which he extorts, as      it were, the favour of the deity[158].          THE DELUGE.          Vivaswata's son, a raja--and a sage of mighty fame,      King of men, the first great fathers--in his glory equalled he,      In his might and kingly power--Manu, and in earthly bliss,      And in wonder-working penance--sire and grandsire far surpassed.      With his arms on high outstretching--wrought the sovereign of men,      Steadily on one foot standing--penance rigorous and dread,      With his downward head low-drooping--with his fixed, unwavering eyes,      Dreed he thus his awful penance--many a long and weary year.        To the penitent with tresses--streaming loose, and wet, and long,      By the margin of Wirini--thus the fish began to speak:        \"Blessed! lo, the least of fishes--of the mighty fish in dread,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#18)"],[1,". This is not to be confounded with bradyphasia or  with bradyarthria or bradylalia (see above).    In children likewise the forming of the sentence takes a long time on  account of the as yet slow rise and combination of ideas, and a simple  narrative is only slowly completed or not finished at all, because the  intellectual processes in the brain are too fatiguing.    _Paraphrasia._--Under the same circumstances as in the case of  bradyphrasia the (slow) speech may be marred and may become  unintelligible because the train of thought is confused--e. g., in  persons \"drunk\" with sleep--so that words are uttered that do not  correspond to the original ideas.    In the case of children who want to tell something, and who begin right,  the story may be interrupted easily by a recollection, a fresh train of  thought, and still they go on; e. g., they mix up two fairy tales,  attaching to the beginning of one the end of another.    _Skoliophrasia._--Distracted and timid feeble-minded persons easily make  mistakes in speaking, because they can not direct their attention to  what they are saying and to the way in which they are saying it, but  they wander, allowing themselves to be turned aside from the thing to be  said by all sorts of ideas and external impressions; and, moreover, they  do not notice afterward that they have been making mistakes (cf. p. 53).    Children frequently put a wrong word in place of a right one well known  to them, without noticing it. They allow themselves to be turned aside  very easily from the main point by external impressions and all sorts of  fancies, and often, in fact, say the opposite of what they mean without  noticing it.    III. DYSMIMIA.    Disturbances of Gesture-Language (Pantomime).    _Perceptive Asemia._--Patients have lost the ability to _understand_  looks and gestures (Steinthal).    Children can not yet understand the looks and gestures of persons about  them.    _Amnesic Amimia._--Aphasic persons can sometimes imitate gestures, but  can not execute them when bid, but only when the gestures are made for  them to imitate. Children that do not yet speak can imitate gestures if  these are made for them to see, but it is often a long time before they  can make them at the word of command.    _Ataxic Dysmimia and Amimia_ (_Mimetic Asemia_).--Patients can _no  longer_ execute significative looks and gestures, on account of  defective co-ordination.    Children can not express their states of desire, etc., because they do  _not yet_ control the requisite co-ordination for the corresponding  looks and gestures.    _Paramimia_ (_Paramimetic Asemia_).--Many patients can make use of looks  and gestures, but confound them.    Children have not yet firmly impressed upon them the significance of  looks and gestures; this is shown in their interchanging of these; e. g.,  the head is shaken in the way of denial when they are affirming  something.    _Emotive Language_ (_Affectsprache_) _in Aphrasia._--In Aphrasia it  happens that smiling, laughing, and weeping are _no longer_ controlled,  and that they break out on the least occasion with the greatest  violence, like the spinal reflexes in decapitated animals.  (Hughlings-Jackson.)    Emotive language may continue when the language of ideas  (Begriffssprache) is completely extinguished, and idiotic children  without speech can even sing.    In children, far slighter occasions suffice normally to call forth  smiles, laughter, and tears, than in adults. These emotional utterances  are _not yet_ often voluntarily inhibited by the child that can not yet  speak; on the contrary, they are unnecessarily repeated.    _Apraxia._--Many patients are _no longer_ in condition, on account of  disturbed intellect, to make right use of ordinary objects, the use of  which they knew well formerly; e. g., they can no longer find the way to  the mouth; or they bite into the soap.    Children are _not yet_ in condition, on account of deficient practice,  to use the common utensils rightly; e. g., they will eat soup with a  fork, and will put the fork against the cheek instead of into the mouth.    4. Development of Speech in the Child.    We may now take up the main question as to the condition of the  child that is learning to speak, in regard to the development and  practicability of the nerve-paths and of the centers required for  speech. For the comparison of the disturbances of speech in adults  with the deficiencies of speech in the child, on the one hand, and  the chronological observation of the child, on the other hand,  disclose to us what parts of the apparatus of speech come by  degrees into operation. First to be considered are the _impressive_  and _expressive_ paths in general.    All new-born human beings are deaf or hard of hearing, as has already  been demonstrated. Since the hearing but slowly grows more acute during  the first days, no utterances of sound at this period can be regarded as  responses to any sound-impressions whatever. The first cry is purely  reflexive, like the croaking of the decapitated frog when the skin of  his back is stroked (Vol. I, p. 214). The cry is not heard by the  newly-born himself and has not the least value as language. It is on a  par with the squeaking of the pig just born, the bleating of the  new-born lamb, and the peeping of the chick that is breaking its shell.    Upon this first, short season of physiological deaf-mutism follows the  period during which crying expresses bodily conditions, feelings such as  pain, hunger, cold. Here, again, there exists as yet no connection of  the expressive phenomena with acoustic impressions, but there is already  the employment of the voice with stronger expiration in case of strong  and disagreeable excitations of other sensory nerves than those of  general sensation and of the skin. For the child now cries at a dazzling  light also, and at a bitter taste, as if the unpleasant feeling were  diminished by the strong motor discharge. In any case the child cries  because this loud, augmented expiration lessens for him the previously  existing unpleasant feelings, without exactly inducing thereby a  comfortable condition.    Not until later does a sudden sound-impression, which at first called  forth only a start and then a quivering of the eyelids, cause also  crying. But this loud sign of fright may be purely reflexive, just like  the silent starting and throwing up of the arms at a sudden noise, and  has at most the significance of an expression of discomfort, like  screaming at a painful blow.    It is otherwise with the first loud response to an acoustic impression  _recognized_ as new. The indefinable sounds of satisfaction made by the  child that hears music for the first time are no longer reflexive, and  are not symptoms of displeasure. I see in this reaction, which may be  compared with the howling of the dog that for the first time in his life  hears music--I see in this reaction of the apparatus of voice and of  future speech, _the first sign of the connection now just established  between impressive_ (acoustic) and _expressive_ (having the character of  emotive language) _paths_. The impressive, separately, were long since  open, as the children under observation after the first week allowed  themselves to be quieted by the singing of cradle-songs, and the  expressive, separately, must likewise have been open, since various  conditions were announced by various sorts of crying.    Everything now depends on a well-established _intercentral  communication_ between the two. This is next to be discussed.    The primitive connection is already an advance upon that of a reflex  arc. The sound-excitations arriving from the ear at the central endings  of the auditory nerve are not directly transformed into motor  excitations for the laryngeal nerves, so that the glottis contracts to  utter vocal sound. When the child (as early as the sixth to the eighth  week) takes pleasure in music and laughs aloud, his voice can not in  this case (as at birth) have been educed by reflex action, for without a  cerebrum he would not laugh or utter joyous sounds, whereas even without  that he cries.    From this, however, by no means follows the existence of a speech-center  in the infant. The fact that he produces sounds easily articulated,  although without choice, like _tahu_ and _amma_, proves merely the  functional capacity of the peripheral apparatus of articulation (in the  seventh week) at a period long before it is intentionally used for  articulation. The unintentionally uttered syllables that make their  appearance are, to be sure, simple, at least in the first half-year. It  is vowels almost exclusively that appear in the first month, and these  predominate for a long time yet. Of the consonants in the third month  _m_ alone is generally to be noted as frequent. This letter comes at a  later period also, from the raising and dropping of the lower jaw in  expiration, an operation that is besides soon easy for the infant with  less outlay of will than the letter _b_, which necessitates a firmer  closing of the lips.    But in spite of the simplicity of all the vocal utterances and of the  defectiveness of the articulatory apparatus, the child is able (often  long before the seventh month) to respond to address, questions,  chiding, either with inarticulate sounds or with vowels or by means of  simple syllables, like _pa_, _ta_, _ma_, _na_, _da_, _mae_, _moe_, _goe_,  _roe_ [_a_ as in _father_; ae as in _fate_; oe like _i_ in _bird_.] Since  these responses are entirely, or almost entirely, lacking in  microcephali and in children born deaf, they are not purely reflexive,  like sneezing, e. g.; therefore there must be in the case of these a  cerebral operation also, simple indeed, but indubitably intellectual,  interposed between sound-perception and vocal utterance, especially as  the infant behaves differently according to what he hears, and he  discriminates "]]]
