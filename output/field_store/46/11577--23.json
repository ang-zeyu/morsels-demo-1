Air flowed--he could breathe! Only--for how long?    Sssuri, seeing that his companion was fully provided for, worked at  the bar locking the sea hatch. But in the end it took their combined  strength to spring that barrier and win through to a small cubby which  was the actual sea lock.    Dalgard knew one moment of resistance as the merman closed the hatch  behind them. For an instant it seemed that the dubious safety of the  dressing chamber and a faint hope of the hunters' giving up their  vigil was better than what might lie before them now. But Sssuri  pushed shut the hatch, and Dalgard stood quietly, without offering any  visible protest.    He tried to draw even breaths--slowly--as the merman activated the  lock. When the water curled in from hidden openings, rising from ankle  to calf and then to knee, its chill striking through flesh to bone, he  kept to the same stolid waiting, though this seemed almost worse than  a sudden gush of water sweeping them out in its embrace.    The liquid swirled about Dalgard's waist now, tugging at his belt, his  arrow quiver, tapping on the bottom of the canister which held his  precious air supply. His bow, shielded from the wet by its casing,  was swallowed up inch by inch.    As the water lapped at his chin, the outer door opened with a slow  inward push which suggested that the machinery controlling it had  grown sluggish with the years. Sssuri, perfectly at home, darted out  as soon as the opening was large enough to afford him an exit. And his  thought came back to reassure the more clumsy landsman.    \"We are in the shallows--land rises ahead. The roots of an island.  There is nothing to fear--\" The word ended abruptly in what was like a  mental gasp of either astonishment or fear.    Knowing all the menaces which might lie in wait, even in the shallows  of the sea, Dalgard drew his knife once more as he plowed through  water--ready to rescue or at least to offer what aid he could.          10    THE DEAD GUARDIANS      The spacemen spent a cramped and almost sleepless night. Although in  his training on Terra, on his trial trips to Mars and the harsh Lunar  valleys, Raf had known weird surroundings and climates, inimical to  his kind, he had always been able to rest almost by the exercise of  his will. But now, curled in his roll, he was alert to every sound out  of the moonless night, finding himself listening--for what he did not  know.    Though there were sounds in plenty. The whistling call of some night  bird, the distant lap, lap of water which he associated with the river  curving through the long-deserted city, the rustle of grass as either  the wind or some passing animal disturbed it.    \"Not the best place in the world for a nap,\" Soriki observed out of  the dark as Raf wriggled, trying to find a more comfortable position.  \"I'll be glad to see these bandaged boys on the ground waving good-bye  as we head away from them--fast--\"    \"Those weren't animals they killed--back on that island.\" Raf brought  out what was at the heart of his trouble.    \"They wore fur instead of clothing.\" Soriki's reply was delivered in a  colorless, even voice. \"We have apes on Terra, but they are not men.\"    Raf stared up at the sky in which stars were sprinkled like carelessly  flung dust motes. \"What is a 'man'?\" he returned, repeating the  classical question which was a debating point in all the space  training centers.    For so long his kind had wondered that. Was a \"man\" a biped with  certain easily recognized physical characteristics? Well, by that  ruling the furry things which had fled fruitlessly from the flames of  the globe might well qualify. Or was \"man\" a certain level of  intelligence, no matter what form housed that intelligence? They were  supposed to accept the latter definition. Though, in spite of the  horror of prejudice, Raf could not help but believe that too many  Terrans secretly thought of \"man\" only as a creature in their own  general image. By that prejudiced rule it was correct to accept the  aliens as \"men\" with whom they could ally themselves, to condemn the  furry people because they were not smooth-skinned, did not wear  clothing, nor ride in mechanical transportation.    Yet somewhere within Raf at that moment was the nagging feeling that  this was all utterly wrong, that the Terrans had not made the right  choice. And that now \"men\" were _not_ standing together. But he had no  intention of spilling that out to Soriki.    \"Man is intelligence.\" The com-tech was answering the question Raf had  almost forgotten that he had asked the moment before. Yes, the proper  conventional reply. Soriki was not going to be caught out with any  claim of prejudice.    Odd--when Pax had ruled, there were thought police and the cardinal  sin was to be a liberal, to experiment, to seek knowledge. Now the  wheel had turned--to be conservative was suspect. To suggest that some  old ways were better was to exhibit the evil signs of prejudice. Raf  grinned wryly. Sure, he had wanted to reach the stars, had fought  doggedly to come to the very spot where he now was. So why was he  tormented now with all these second thoughts? Why did he feel every  day less akin to the men with whom he had shared the voyage? He had  had wit enough to keep his semirebellion under cover, but since he had  taken the flitter into the morning sky above the landing place of the  spacer, that task of self-discipline was becoming more and more  difficult.    \"Did you notice,\" the com-tech said, going off on a new track, \"that  these painted boys were not too quick about blasting along to their  strongbox? I'd say that they thought some bright rocket jockey might  have rigged a surprise for them somewhere in there--\"    Now that Soriki mentioned it, Raf remembered that the alien party who  had gone into the city had huddled together, and that several of the  black-and-white warriors had fanned out ahead as scouts might in enemy  territory.    \"They didn't go any farther than that building to the west either.\"    That Raf had not noticed, but he was willing to accept Soriki's  observation. The com-tech had a ready eye for details. He'd better pay  closer attention himself. This was no time to explore the why and  wherefore of his present position. So, if they went no farther than  that building, it would argue that the aliens themselves didn't care  to go about here after nightfall. For he was certain that the isolated  structure Soriki had pointed out was not the treasure house they had  come to loot.    The night wore on and sometime during it Raf fell asleep. But the two  or three hours of restless, dream-filled unconsciousness was not what  he needed, and he blinked in the dawn with eyes which felt as if they  were filled with hot sand. In the first gray light a covey of winged  things, which might or might not have been birds, arose from some  roosting place within the city, wheeled three times over the building,  and then vanished out over the countryside.    Raf pulled himself out of his roll, made a sketchy toilet with the  preparations in a belt kit, and looked about with little favor for  either the scene or his part in it. The globe, sealed as if ready for  a take-off, was some distance away, but installed about halfway  between it and the flitter were two of the alien warriors. Perhaps  they had changed watches during the night. If they had not, they could  go without sleep to an amazing degree, for as Raf walked in a circle  about the flyer to limber up, they watched him closely, nor did their  grips on their odd weapons loosen. And he had a very clear idea that  if he stepped over some invisible boundary he would be in for trouble.    When he came back to the flitter, Soriki was awake and stretching.    \"Another day,\" the com-tech drawled. \"And I could do with something  besides field rations.\" He made a face at the small tin of  concentrates he had dug out of the supply compartment.    \"We'd do well to be headed west,\" Raf ventured.    \"Now you can come in with that on the com again!\" Soriki answered with  unwonted emphasis. \"The sooner I see the old girl standing on her pins  in the middle distance, the better I'll feel. You know\"--he looked up  from his preoccupation with the ration package and gazed out over the  city--\"this place gives me the shivers. That other town was bad  enough. But at least there were people living there. Here's nothing at  all--at least nothing I want to see.\"    \"What about all the wonders they've promised to show us?\" countered  Raf.    Soriki grinned. \"And how much do we understand of their mouth-and-hand  talk? Maybe they were promising us wonders, maybe they were offering to  take us to where we could have our throats cut more conveniently--for them!  I tell you, if I go for a walk with any of these painted faces, I'm going  to have at least three of my fingers resting on the grip of my stun gun.  And I'd advise you to do the same--if I didn't know that you were already  watching these blast-happy harpies out of the corner of your eye.  Ha--company. Oh, it's the captain--\"    The hatch of the globe had opened, and a small party was descending  the ladder, conspicuous among them the form and uniform of Captain  Hobart. The aliens remained in a cluster at the foot of the ladder  while the Terran commander crossed to the flitter.    \"You\"--he pointed to Raf--\"are to come along with us.\"    \"Why, sir?\" \"What about me, sir?\" The questions from the two at the  flitter came together.    \"I said that one of you had to remain by the machine. Then they said  that you, in particular, must come along, Kurbi.\"    \"But I'm the pilot--\" Raf began and then realized that it was just  that fact which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18464"],[0,"The Wit and Humor of America, Volume I.

Putnam's Sons.]          COLONEL STERETT'S PANTHER HUNT    BY ALFRED HENRY LEWIS      \"Panthers, what we-all calls 'mountain lions,'\" observed the Old  Cattleman, wearing meanwhile the sapient air of him who feels equipped  of his subject, \"is plenty furtive, not to say mighty sedyoolous to  skulk. That's why a gent don't meet up with more of 'em while pirootin'  about in the hills. Them cats hears him, or they sees him, an' him still  ignorant tharof; an' with that they bashfully withdraws. Which it's to  be urged in favor of mountain lions that they never forces themse'fs on  no gent; they're shore considerate, that a-way, an' speshul of  themse'fs. If one's ever hurt, you can bet it won't be a accident.  However, it ain't for me to go 'round impugnin' the motives of no  mountain lion; partic'lar when the entire tribe is strangers to me  complete. But still a love of trooth compels me to concede that if  mountain lions ain't cowardly, they're shore cautious a lot. Cattle an'  calves they passes up as too bellicose, an' none of 'em ever faces any  anamile more warlike than a baby colt or mebby a half-grown deer. I'm  ridin' along the Caliente once when I hears a crashin' in the bushes on  the bluff above--two hundred foot high, she is, an' as sheer as the  walls of this yere tavern. As I lifts my eyes, a fear-frenzied mare an'  colt comes chargin' up an' projects themse'fs over the precipice an'  lands in the valley below. They're dead as Joolius Caesar when I rides  onto 'em, while a brace of mountain lions is skirtin' up an' down the  aige of the bluff they leaps from, mewin' an' lashin' their long tails  in hot enthoosiasm. Shore, the cats has been chasin' the mare an' foal,  an' they locoes 'em to that extent they don't know where they're headin'  an' makes the death jump I relates. I bangs away with my six-shooter,  but beyond givin' the mountain lions a convulsive start I can't say I  does any execootion. They turns an' goes streakin' it through the pine  woods like a drunkard to a barn raisin'.    \"Timid? Shore! They're that timid, seminary girls compared to 'em is as  sternly courageous as a passel of buccaneers. Out in Mitchell's canyon a  couple of the Lee-Scott riders cuts the trail of a mountain lion and her  two kittens. Now whatever do you-all reckon this old tabby does? Basely  deserts her offsprings without even barin' a tooth, an' the cow-punchers  takes 'em gently by their tails an' beats out their joovenile brains.  That's straight; that mother lion goes swarmin' up the canyon like she  ain't got a minute to live. An' you can gamble the limit that where a  anamile sees its children perish without frontin' up for war, it don't  possess the commonest roodiments of sand.
