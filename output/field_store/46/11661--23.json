They died out, would not work at the Penetanguishene  settlement, and have vanished from the things that be. Poor fellows!  many a tale have they told me of flood and field, of being sabred by the  cuirassiers at Waterloo, of being impaled on a Polish lance, and of  their wanderings and sufferings.    The military settlement, however, of the Penetanguishene road is a  different affair. It was effected by pensioned non-commissioned officers  and soldiers, who had grants of a hundred acres and sometimes more; and  it will please the benevolent founder, should these pages meet his eye,  to know that many of them are now prosperous, and almost all well to do  in the world.    But we must retrace our steps, and waggon back again by their doors to  Barrie.    I left the village at half-past six in the morning, raining still, with  the wind in the south-east, and very cold. We arrived at the Widow  Marlow's, nineteen miles, at mid-day; the weather having changed to fine  and blowing hard--certainly not pleasant in the forest-road, on account  of the danger of falling trees, to which this pass is so liable that a  party of axemen have sometimes to go ahead to cut out a way for the  horses.    We passed through the twelve mile woods by a new road, which reduces the  extent of actual forest to five, and avoids altogether the Trees of the  Two Brothers, noted in Penetanguishene history for the fatal accident,  narrated in a former volume, by which one soldier died, and his brother  was, it is supposed, frightened to death, in the solemn depths of the  primeval and then endless woods.    Near the end of the five mile Bush, about a mile from the first  clearance, Jeffrey, the landlord of the inn at the village, has built a  small cottage for the refreshment of the traveller, and in it he intends  to place his son. In the mean time, until quite completed, for money is  scarce and things not to be done at railroad pace so near the North  Pole, he has located here an old well known black gentleman, called Mr.  Davenport, who was once better to do in the world, and kept a tavern  himself.    Having had the honour of his acquaintance for many years, I stopped to  see how my old friend was getting on, particularly as I heard that he  was now very old, and that his white consort had left him alone in the  narrow world of the house in the woods. He received me with grinning  delight, and told me that he had just left the new jail at Barrie for  selling liquor without a license, which, I opine, is rather hard law  against a poor old nigger, who had literally no other means of support,  and was most usefully stationed, like the monks of St. Bernard, in a  dangerous pass.    But the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb, and the woolly head of old  Davenport had matter of satisfaction in it from a source that he never  dreamed of.    Alone--far away from the whole human world, in the depth of a hideous  forest, with a road nearly impassable one half of the year,--he found an  unexpected friend.    For fear of the visits of two-footed and four-footed brutes during the  long nights of his Robinson Crusoe solitude, old Davenport always shut  up his log castle early, and retired to rest as soon as daylight  departed; for it did so very early in the evening there, as the solemn  pines, with their gray trunks and far-spreading moss-grown arms and  dismal evergreen foliage, if it can be called foliage, stood close to  his dwelling--nay, brushed with the breath of the wind his very roof.    Recollect, reader, that this lonely dweller in the Bush resided near the  spot where the two soldier brothers perished; and you may imagine his  thoughts, after his castle was closed at night by the lone warder. No  one could come to his assistance, if he had the bugle that roused the  echoes of Fontarabia.    He had retired to rest early one night in the young spring-time, when he  heard a singular noise on the outside of his house, like somebody  moaning, and rubbing forcibly under his window, which was close to the  head of his pallet-bed. Quivering with fear, he lay, with these sounds  continuing at short intervals, through the whole night, and did not rise  until the sun was well up. He then peeped cautiously about, but neither  heard nor saw any thing; and, axe in hand and gun loaded, he went forth,  but could not perceive aught more than that the ground had been slightly  disturbed. This went on for some time, until at last, one fine moonlight  night, the old man ventured to open a part of his narrow window; and  there he saw rubbing himself, very composedly, a fine large he bear, who  looked up very affectionately at him, and whined in a decent melancholy  growl.    Davenport had, it seems, thrown some useless article of food out of this  window; and Bruin supposed, no doubt, that Blackey did it out of  compassionate feeling for a fellow denizen of the forest, and repeated  his visits to obtain something more substantial, rubbing himself, to get  rid of the mosquitoes, as it was his custom of an afternoon, against the  rough logs of the dwelling. He had, moreover, become a little impatient  at not being noticed, and scratched like a dog to make the lord of the  mansion aware of his presence. This usually occurred about nine o'clock.    Davenport, at last, threw some salt pork to Bruin, which was most  gratefully received; and every night after that, for the whole summer  and autumn, at nine o'clock or thereabouts, the bear came to receive  bread, meat, milk, or potatoes, or whatever could be spared from the  larder, which was left on the ground under the window for him. In fact,  they soon came to be upon very friendly terms, and spent many hours in  each other's company, with a stout log-wall between Davenport and his  brother, as he always calls the bear.    When the snows of winter, the long, severe winter of these northern  woods, at last came, Bruin ceased his nocturnal visitations, and has  never been seen since, the old man thinking that he has been shot or  trapped by the Indian hunters.    I asked Davenport if he ever ventured out to look for his brother, but  he shook his head and replied, \"My brudder might have hugged me too  hard, perhaps.\" The poor old fellow is very cheerful, and regrets his  brother's absence daily. The bailiffs most likely would not have put him  in jail for selling whiskey to a tired traveller, but would have avoided  the castle in the woods, if they thought there was any chance of meeting  Bruin.          CHAPTER VI.        Barrie and Big Trees--A new Capital of a new District--Nature's    Canal--The Devil's Elbow--Macadamization and Mud--Richmond Hill    without the Lass--The Rebellion and the Radicals--Blue Hill and    Bricks.      We reached Barrie safely that night, and slept at the Queen's Arms. Next  morning, I had an excellent opportunity of seeing this thriving village.    It is very well situated on the shore of Kempenfeldt Bay, on ground  rising gradually to a considerable height, and is neatly laid out,  containing already about five hundred people.    On the high ground overlooking the place are a church, a court-house,  and a jail, all standing at a small distance from each other, nearly on  a line, and adding very much indeed to the appearance of the place. The  deep woods now form a background, but are gradually disappearing. I went  about a mile into them, and saw several new clearances, with some nice  houses building or built; and particularly one by Bingham, our landlord,  a very comfortable, English-looking, large cottage, with outhouses and  an immense barn, round which the rascally ground squirrels were playing  at hide-and-seek very fearlessly.    The Court House contains the district school, which appears very  respectable, and is conducted by a young Irishman; it also contains all  the district offices, and is two stories high, massively and well built,  the lower story being of stone and the upper of brick, both from  materials on the spot.    The church is of wood, plain and neat. The jail is worth a visit, and  shows what may be done in the forest and in a brand-new district, as the  district of Simcoe is, although I believe about half the money it cost  would have been better employed on the roads; for it has never been  used, except as a place of confinement for an unfortunate lunatic.    It is formed in the castellated style, of a handsome octagonal tower, of  very white, shelly limestone, with a square turreted stone enclosure, on  the top of which is an iron _chevaux de frize_, and which enclosure is  subdivided into separate day-yards for prisoners. The entrance is under  a Gothic archway; and in the centre of the tower is an internal space,  open from top to bottom, and preventing all access to the stairs from  the cells, which are very neat, clean, and commodious, with a good  supply of water, and excellent ventilation. It is, in short, as pretty a  toy penitentiary as you could see anywhere, and looks more like an Isle  of Wight gentleman's fortress, copied after the most approved Wyattville  pattern of baronial mansion, with a little touch of the card-house. In  short, it is as fine as you can conceive, and sets off the village  wonderfully well.    The red pine, near Barrie and through all the Penetanguishene country,  grows to an enormous size. I measured one near Barrie no less than  twenty-six feet in girth, and this was merely a chance one by the  path-side. Its height, I think, must have been at least two hundred  feet, and it was vigorously healthy. What was its age? It would have  made a plank eight feet broad, after the bark was stripped off.    But the woods generally disappoint travellers, as they never penetrate  them; and the lumberers have cut down all available pines and oaks  within reach"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#18)"],[1," you a  silly question?--is not the Queen of Spain[8] rather clever? You know  her, and what do you think of her? And do you know what sort of people  are about poor little Queen Isabel?[9] Poor, good Donna Maria! I feel  much for her; her education was one of the worst that could be. As  long as those Ficalhos and Melos remain about her, nothing can be  done. Could they not be got rid of in time?    I was sorry to see that the French Chambers were rather stormy.[10]    I thank you much for the list of the ball of the 18th, which must  have been very splendid. The last ball _I_ was at was our own, and  I concluded that very ball at half-past three in the morning with a  country dance, Albert being my partner.    Pray, dear Uncle, tell both young gentlemen, with my kindest love,  that I _often_ think of that night and of many other pleasant evenings  we passed together. The singing will come all in time. Who is their  singing-master? I wish they had my worthy Lablache. I sing regularly  every evening, as I think it better to do so every day to keep  the voice manageable. Oh, my beloved Uncle, could you join us, how  delightful that would be! How I should delight in singing with you all  our favourite things from _La Gazza_, _Otello_, _Il Barbiere_, etc.,  etc.    The little Cousin[11] must be a little love: oh, could I but see him  and play with him! Pray, dear Uncle, does he know such a thing as that  he has got an Aunt and Cousin on the other side of the water? ...    Pray, dear Uncle, have you read Sir R. Peel's two speeches? I wish you  would, and give me your opinion of them.

I am very sorry that the Portuguese news are  still so very unfavourable; I trust that, in time, things will come  right. The Portuguese are, as you say, a most inconceivable set of  selfish politicians.    Our friend, Mr Hume,[12] made a most violent speech at a dinner given  to him and old George Byng[13] at Drury Lane last week.[14] He called  Sir R. Peel and some other Tories \"the cloven foot,\" which I think  rather strong. I think that _great_ violence and striving such a pity,  on both sides, don't you, dear Uncle? They irritate one another so  uselessly by calling one another fools, blockheads, liars, and so  forth for no purpose. I think violence so bad in everything. They  should imitate you, and be calm, for you have had, God knows! enough  cause for irritation from your _worthy_ Dutch neighbours and others.  You will, I fear, laugh at my _politics_, but I like telling _you_ my  feelings, for you alone can put me right on such subjects.        [Footnote 12: Joseph Hume, leader of the Radical party, was      now M.P. for Middlesex.]        [Footnote 13: George Byng, for many years Member for      Middlesex, was great-grandson of William Wentworth, Earl of      Strafford, of the 1711 creation.

Grote also spoke and said      that the Tories well knew that their dominion rested upon      everything that was antiquated and corrupt and anti-popular in      the nation--upon oligarchical predominance in the State, and      sectarian pride and privileges in the Church.]          [Pageheading: POLITICAL PASSION]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    _3rd February 1837._    MY DEAR CHILD,-- ... I am sorry to see so much violence in England at  this moment; I consider it as the most lamentable circumstance, as it  renders matters so very difficult to settle. Besides, the poor Crown  is more or less the loser in all this, as it generally ends with the  abolition of something or other which might have proved useful for the  carrying on of Government. A rule which you may thus early impress on  your mind is, that people are far from acting generally according to  the dictates of their interests, but oftener in consequence of their  passions, though it may even prove injurious to their interests.  If the Tory part of Parliament could have brought themselves to act  without passion, much in the reform of Parliament might have been  settled much more in conformity with their best interests. I was  authorised, in 1831, to speak in this sense to the Duke of Wellington  by Lord Grey;[15] the effect would have been highly beneficial to  both parties, but passion made it impossible to succeed. This is a  dangerous part of the business, and we must see during the present  session of Parliament if parties are grown wiser. I fear they are not.  The business of the highest in a State is certainly, in my opinion,  to act with great impartiality and a spirit of justice for the good of  all, and not of this or that party.[16]        [Footnote 15: This refers to the rejection of the Reform Bill      by the House of Lords in 1831; as a consequence, mobs broke      the windows of Apsley House, and fired Nottingham Castle.]        [Footnote 16: On 14th April 1837, Sir Robert Peel wrote to J.      W. Croker:-- ... \"We are, in short, in this state of things.      All the convictions and inclinations of the Government are      with their Conservative opponents. Half their actions and all      their speeches are with the Radicals.\" (_Croker Papers_, ii.      306.)]          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    CLAREMONT, _6th February 1837._    MY BELOVED UNCLE,-- ... I do not know quite for certain when we leave  this place, but I should think to-day week. You must be pleased, dear  Uncle, I think, for we shall have been _six months_ in the country  next Thursday, as we left town on the 10th of August last, and I am  sure you will stand by me for my having my season fully, as you may  understand that my _Operatic_ and _Terpsichorean_ feelings are pretty  strong, now that the season is returning, and I have been a very good  child, not even _wishing_ to come to town till now. We shall certainly  come here for the Easter week.    Dr Clark[17] arrived here quite happy last night, bringing the news  that Van de Weyer had had the best news from Lisbon he had received  since his return, that all had gone off quietly, that Ferdinand was  daily gaining popularity, and that both he and the Queen had been very  well received at the theatre. The man who threw a stone at Ferdinand  was a Frenchman, whom, it seems, Ferdinand had relieved with money  over and over again. A fine specimen of gratitude!    I hope and trust with you that there will be less violence in  Parliament this year, but much is to be feared.    You will miss my good cousins Ernest and Albert very much, I am sure;  I hope you will instil into them to take enough exercise and not to  study too much.    There were two questions in my last letter but one, which you have  not answered, dear Uncle. They are: 1st, What you think of the Queen  Christina of Spain, what opinion _you_ have of her, as one cannot  believe _reports_? 2nd, If you know what sort of people are about  poor little Queen Isabel, and if she is being _well_ or _ill_ brought  up?...        [Footnote 17: Afterwards Sir James Clark, and      Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen.]        [Pageheading: A DINNER PARTY]    [Pageheading: THE THRONE OF GREECE]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _14th March 1837._    ... We had a dinner on Saturday which amused me, as I am very fond  of _pleasant_ society, and we have been for these last three weeks  immured within our old palace, and I longed sadly for some gaiety.  After being so very long in the country I was preparing to go out in  right earnest, whereas I have only been _twice_ to the play since our  return, which is marvellous! However, we are to have another dinner  to-morrow, and are going to the play and Opera. After Easter I trust  I shall make ample amends for all this solitariness. I hope to begin  singing with Lablache shortly after Easter. But to return to last  Saturday's dinner. We had the Archbishop of Dublin,[18] a clever but  singular man, and his lady; Lord Palmerston, with whom I had much  pleasant and amusing conversation after dinner--you know how agreeable  he is; then Lady Cadogan,[19] who enquired much after you and Aunt  Louise; Lord and Lady Rosebery,[20] Mr and Mrs E. Stanley,[21] Lord  Morpeth,[22] Lord Templetown,[23] Sir John Cam Hobhouse,[24] Dr  Lushington,[25] and Mr Woulfe,[26] the Solicitor-General for Ireland,  a Roman Catholic and a very clever man. Lady Cadogan, who is not long  come back from Paris, says that the Duke of Orleans has been going out  very little and is remarkably well. I saw a report in the papers that  "]]]
