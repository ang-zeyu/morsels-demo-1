Can we not get some little insight into the structure and  general mode of developing the leading coal-tar colours which serve as  types of whole series? I will try what can be done with the little  knowledge of chemistry we have so far accumulated. In our earlier  lectures we have learnt that water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen,  and in its compound atom or molecule we have two atoms of hydrogen  combined with one of oxygen, symbolised as H_{2}O. We also learnt that  ammonia, or spirits of hartshorn, is a compound of hydrogen with  nitrogen, three atoms of hydrogen being combined with one of nitrogen,  thus, NH_{3}. An example of a hydrocarbon or compound of carbon and  hydrogen, is marsh gas (methane) or firedamp, CH_{4}. Nitric acid, or  _aqua fortis_, is a compound of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, one atom  of the first to three of the second and one of the third--NO_{3}H. But  this nitric acid question forces me on to a further statement, namely,  we have in this formula or symbol, NO_{3}H, a twofold idea--first, that  of the compound as a whole, an acid; and secondly, that it is formed  from a substance without acid properties by the addition of water,  H_{2}O, or, if we like, HOH. This substance contains the root or radical  of the nitric acid, and is NO_{2}, which has the power of replacing one  of the hydrogen atoms, or H, of water, and so we get, instead of HOH,  NO_{2}OH, which is nitric acid. This is chemical replacement, and on  such replacement depends our powers of building up not only colours, but  many other useful and ornamental chemical structures. You have all heard  the old-fashioned statement that \"Nature abhors a vacuum.\" We had a very  practical example of this when in our first lecture on water I brought  an electric spark in contact with a mixture of free oxygen and hydrogen  in a glass bulb. These gases at once united, three volumes of them  condensing to two volumes, and these again to a minute particle of  liquid water. A vacuum was left in that delicate glass bulb whilst the  pressure of the atmosphere was crushing with a force of 15 lb. on the  square inch on the outside of the bulb, and thus a violent crash was the  result of Nature's abhorrence. There is such a kind of thing, though,  and of a more subtle sort, which we might term a chemical vacuum, and it  is the result of what we call chemical valency, which again might be  defined as the specific chemical appetite of each substance.    Let us now take the case of the production of an aniline colour, and let  us try to discover what aniline is, and how formed. I pointed to benzene  or benzol in the table as a hydrocarbon, C_{6}H_{6}, which forms a  principal colour-producing constituent of coal-tar. If you desire to  produce chemical appetite in benzene, you must rob it of some of its  hydrogen. Thus C_{6}H_{5} is a group that would exist only for a moment,  since it has a great appetite for H, and we may say this appetite would  go the length of at once absorbing either one atom of H (hydrogen) or of  some similar substance or group having a similar appetite. Suppose, now,  I place some benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, in a flask, and add some nitric acid,  which, as we said, is NO_{2}OH. On warming the mixture we may say a  tendency springs up in that OH of the nitric acid to effect union with  an H of the C_{6}H_{6} (benzene) to form HOH (water), when an appetite  is at once left to the remainder, C_{6}H_{5}--on the one hand, and the  NO_{2}--on the other, satisfied by immediate union of these residues to  form a substance C_{6}H_{6}NO_{2}, nitro-benzene or \"essence of  mirbane,\" smelling like bitter almonds. This is the first step in the  formation of aniline.    I think I have told you that if we treat zinc scraps with water and  vitriol, or water with potassium, we can rob that water of its oxygen  and set free the hydrogen. It is, however, a singular fact that if we  liberate a quantity of fresh hydrogen amongst our nitrobenzene  C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}, that hydrogen tends to combine, or evinces an  ungovernable appetite for the O_{2} of that NO_{2} group, the tendency  being again to form water H_{2}O. This, of course, leaves the residual  C_{6}H_{5}N: group with an appetite, and only the excess of hydrogen  present to satisfy it. Accordingly hydrogen is taken up, and we get  C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} formed, which is aniline. I told you that ammonia is  NH_{3}, and now in aniline we find an ammonia derivative, one atom of  hydrogen (H) being replaced by the group C_{6}H_{5}. I will now describe  the method of preparation of a small quantity of aniline, in order to  illustrate what I have tried to explain in theory. Benzene from coal-tar  is warmed with nitric acid in a flask. A strong action sets in, and on  adding water, the nitrobenzene settles down as a heavy oil, and the acid  water can be decanted off. After washing by decantation with water once  or twice, and shaking with some powdered marble to neutralise excess of  acid, the nitrobenzene is brought into contact with fresh hydrogen gas  by placing amongst it, instead of zinc, some tin, and instead of  vitriol, some hydrochloric acid (spirits of salt). To show you that  aniline is formed, I will now produce a violet colour with it, which  only aniline will give. This violet colour is produced by adding a very  small quantity of the aniline, together with some bleaching powder, to a  mixture of chalk and water, the chalk being added for the purpose of  destroying acidity. This aniline, C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}, is a base, and forms  the foundation of all the so-called basic aniline colours. If I have  made myself clear so far, I shall be contented. It only remains to be  said that for making Magenta, pure aniline will not do, what is used  being a mixture of aniline, with an aniline a step higher, prepared from  toluene. If I were to give you the formula of Magenta you would be  astonished at its complexity and size, but I think now you will see that  it is really built up of aniline derivatives. Methyl Violet is a colour  we have already referred to, and its chemical structure is still more  complex, but it also is built up of aniline materials, and so is a basic  aniline colour. Now it is possible for the colour-maker to prepare a  very fine green dye from this beautiful violet (Methyl Violet). In fact  he may convert the violet into the green colour by heating the first  under pressure with a gas called methyl chloride (CH_{3}Cl). Methyl  Violet is constructed of aniline or substituted aniline groups; the  addition of CH_{3}Cl, then, gives us the Methyl Green. But one of the  misfortunes of Methyl Green is that if the fabric dyed with it be boiled  with water, at that temperature (212 deg. F.) the colour is decomposed and  injured, for some of the methyl chloride in the compound is driven off.  In fact, by stronger heating we may drive off all the methyl chloride  and get the original Methyl Violet back again.    But we have coal-tar colours which are not basic, but rather of the  nature of acid,--a better term would be _phenolic_, or of the nature of  phenol or carbolic acid. Let us see what phenol or carbolic acid is. We  saw that water may be formulated HOH, and that benzene is C_{6}H_{6}.  Well, carbolic acid or phenol is a derivative of water, or a derivative  of benzene, just as you like, and it is formulated C_{6}H_{5}OH. You can  easily prove this by dropping carbolic acid or phenol down a red-hot  tube filled with iron-borings. The oxygen is taken up by the iron to  give oxide of iron, and benzene is obtained, thus: C_{6}H_{5}OH gives O  and C_{6}H_{6}. But there is another hydrocarbon called naphthalene,  C_{10}H_{8}, and this forms not one, but two phenols. As the name of the  hydrocarbon is naphthalene, however, we call these compounds naphthols,  and one is distinguished as alpha- the other as beta-naphthol, both of  them having the formula C_{10}H_{7}OH. But now with respect to the  colours. If we treat phenol with nitric acid under proper conditions, we  get a yellow dye called picric acid, which is trinitro-phenol  C_{6}H_{2}(NO_{2})_{3}OH; you see this is no aniline dye; it is not a  basic colour, for it would saturate, _i.e._ destroy the basicity of  bases. Again, by oxidising phenol with oxalic acid and vitriol, we get a  colour dyeing silk orange, namely, Aurin, HO.C[C_{6}H_{4}(OH)]_{3}. This  is also an acid or phenolic dye, as a glance at its formula will show  you. Its compound atom bristles, so to say, with phenol-residues, as  some of the aniline dyes do with aniline residue-groups.    We come now to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#18)"],[1," lying between the Saskatchewan and the Missouri. The two great  annual expeditions of the Red River half-breeds, which always took place  in summer, went in two directions from Winnipeg and Pembina--one, the  White Horse Plain division, going westward along the Qu'Appelle to the  Saskatchewan country, and the other, the Red River division, southwest  into Dakota. In 1840 the site of the present city of Jamestown, Dakota,  was the northeastern limit of the herds that summered in Dakota, and the  country lying between that point and the Missouri was for years the  favorite hunting ground of the Red River division.    The herds which wintered on the Montana ranges always went north in the  early spring, usually in March, so that during the time the hunters were  hauling in the hides taken on the winter hunt the ranges were entirely  deserted. It is equally certain, however, that a few small bauds  remained in certain portions of Montana throughout the summer. But the  main body crossed the international boundary, and spent the summer on  the plains of the Saskatchewan, where they were hunted by the  half-breeds from the Red River settlements and the Indians of the  plains. It is my belief that in this movement nearly all the buffaloes  of Montana and Dakota participated, and that the herds which spent the  summer in Dakota, where they were annually hunted by the Red River  half-breeds, came up from Kansas, Colorado, and Nebraska.    While most of the calves were born on the summer ranges, many were  brought forth en route. It was the habit of the cows to retire to a  secluded spot, if possible a ravine well screened from observation,  bring forth their young, and nourish and defend them until they were  strong enough to join the herd. Calves were born all the time from March  to July, and sometimes even as late as August. On the summer ranges it  was the habit of the cows to leave the bulls at calving time, and thus  it often happened that small herds were often seen composed of bulls  only. Usually the cow produced but one calf, but twins were not  uncommon. Of course many calves were brought forth in the herd, but the  favorite habit of the cow was as stated. As soon as the young calves  were brought into the herd, which for prudential reasons occurred at the  earliest possible moment, the bulls assumed the duty of protecting them  from the wolves which at all times congregated in the vicinity of a  herd, watching for an opportunity to seize a calf or a wounded buffalo  which might be left behind. A calf always follows its mother until its  successor is appointed and installed, unless separated from her by force  of circumstances. They suck until they are nine months old, or even  older, and Mr. McNaney once saw a lusty calf suck its mother (in  January) on the Montana range several hours after she had been killed  for her skin.    When a buffalo is wounded it leaves the herd immediately and goes off as  far from the line of pursuit as it can get, to escape the rabble of  hunters, who are sure to follow the main body. If any deep ravines are  at hand the wounded animal limps away to the bottom of the deepest and  most secluded one, and gradually works his way up to its very head,  where he finds himself in a perfect cul-de-sac, barely wide enough to  admit him. Here he is so completely hidden by the high walls and  numerous bends that his pursuer must needs come within a few feet of his  horns before his huge bulk is visible. I have more than once been  astonished at the real impregnability of the retreats selected by  wounded bison. In following up wounded bulls in ravine headings it  always became too dangerous to make the last stage of the pursuit on  horseback, for fear of being caught in a passage so narrow as to insure  a fatal accident to man or horse in case of a sudden discovery of the  quarry. I have seen wounded bison shelter in situations where a single  bull could easily defend himself from a whole pack of wolves, being  completely walled in on both sides and the rear, and leaving his foes no  point of attack save his head and horns.    Bison which were nursing serious wounds most often have gone many days  at a time without either food or water, and in this connection it may be  mentioned that the recuperative power of a bison is really wonderful.  Judging from the number of old leg wounds, fully healed, which I have  found in freshly killed bisons, one may be tempted to believe that a  bison never died of a broken leg. One large bull which I skeletonized  had had his humerus shot squarely in two, but it had united again more  firmly than ever. Another large bull had the head of his left femur and  the hip socket shattered completely to pieces by a big ball, but he had  entirely recovered from it, and was as lusty a runner as any bull we  chased. We found that while a broken leg was a misfortune to a buffalo,  it always took something more serious than that to stop him.          VI. THE FOOD OF THE BISON.      It is obviously impossible to enumerate all the grasses which served the  bison as food on his native heath without presenting a complete list of  all the plants of that order found in a given region; but it is at least  desirable to know which of the grasses of the great pasture region were  his favorite and most common food. It was the nutritious character and  marvelous abundance of his food supply which enabled the bison to exist  in such absolutely countless numbers as characterized his occupancy of  the great plains. The following list comprises the grasses which were  the bison's principal food, named in the order of their importance:    _Bouteloua oligostachya_ (buffalo, grama, or mesquite grass).--This  remarkable grass formed the _pièce de résistance_ of the bison's bill  of fare in the days when he flourished, and it now comes to us daily in  the form of beef produced of primest quality and in greatest quantity on  what was until recently the great buffalo range. This grass is the most  abundant and widely distributed species to be found in the great pasture  region between the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and the  nineteenth degree of west longitude. It is the principal grass of the  plains from Texas to the British Possessions, and even in the latter  territory it is quite conspicuous. To any one but a botanist its first  acquaintance means a surprise. Its name and fame lead the unacquainted  to expect a grass which is tall, rank, and full of \"fodder,\" like the  \"blue joint\" (_Andropogon provincialis_). The grama grass is very short,  the leaves being usually not more than 2 or 3 inches in length and  crowded together at the base of the stems. The flower stalk is about a  foot in height, but on grazed lands are eaten off and but seldom seen.  The leaves are narrow and inclined to curl, and lie close to the ground.  Instead of developing a continuous growth, this grass grows in small,  irregular patches, usually about the size of a man's hand, with narrow  strips of perfectly bare ground between them. The grass curls closely  upon the ground, in a woolly carpet or cushion, greatly resembling a  layer of Florida moss. Even in spring-time it never shows more color  than a tint of palest green, and the landscape which is dependent upon  this grass for color is never more than \"a gray and melancholy waste.\"  Unlike the soft, juicy, and succulent grasses of the well-watered  portions of the United States, the tiny leaves of the grama grass are  hard, stiff, and dry. I have often noticed that in grazing neither  cattle nor horses are able to bite off the blades, but instead each leaf  is pulled out of the tuft, seemingly by its root.    Notwithstanding its dry and uninviting appearance, this grass is highly  nutritious, and its fat-producing qualities are unexcelled. The heat of  summer dries it up effectually without destroying its nutritive  elements, and it becomes for the remainder of the year excellent hay,  cured on its own roots. It affords good grazing all the year round, save  in winter, when it is covered with snow, and even then, if the snow is  not too deep, the buffaloes, cattle, and horses paw down through it to  reach the grass, or else repair to wind-swept ridges and hill-tops,  where the snow has been blown off and left the grass partly exposed.  Stock prefer it to all the other grasses of the plains.    On bottom-lands, where moisture is abundant, this grass develops much  more luxuriantly, growing in a close mass, and often to a height of a  foot or more, if not grazed down, when it is cut for hay, and sometimes  yields 11/2 tons to the acre. In Montana and the north it is generally  known as \"buffalo-grass,\" a name to which it would seem to be fully  entitled, notwithstanding the fact that this name is also applied, and  quite generally, to another species, the next to be noticed.    _Buchloë dactyloides_ (Southern buffalo-grass).--This species is next  in value and extent of distribution to the grama grass. It also is found  all over the great plains south of Nebraska and southern Wyoming, but  not further north, although in many localities it occurs so sparsely as  to be of little account. A single bunch of it very greatly resembles  _Bouteloua oligostachya_, but its general growth is very different. It  is very short, its general mass seldom rising more than 3 inches above  the ground. It grows in extensive patches, and spreads by means of  stolons, which sometimes are 2 feet in length, with joints every 3 or 4  inches. Owing to its southern distribution this might well be named the  Southern buffalo grass, to distinguish it from the two other species of  higher latitudes, to which the name \"buffalo\" has been fastened forever.    _Stipa spartea_ (Northern buffalo-grass; wild oat).--This grass is found  in southern Manitoba, westwardly across the plains to the Rocky  Mountains, and southward as far as Montana, where it is common in many  localities.
