The plan of the \"_Henriade_\" was sketched, and the greater part  composed, by Voltaire during his imprisonment in the Bastile; and \"the  Pilgrim's Progress\" of Bunyan was performed in the circuit of a prison's  walls.    Howell, the author of \"Familiar Letters,\" wrote the chief part of them,  and almost all his other works, during his long confinement in the Fleet  prison: he employed his fertile pen for subsistence; and in all his  books we find much entertainment.    Lydiat, while confined in the King's Bench for debt, wrote his  Annotations on the Parian Chronicle, which were first published by  Prideaux. He was the learned scholar alluded to by Johnson; an allusion  not known to Boswell and others.    The learned Selden, committed to prison for his attacks on the divine  right of tithes and the king's prerogative, prepared during his  confinement his \"History of Eadmer,\" enriched by his notes.    Cardinal Polignac formed the design of refuting the arguments of the  sceptics which Bayle had been renewing in his dictionary; but his public  occupations hindered him. Two exiles at length fortunately gave him the  leisure; and the Anti-Lucretius is the fruit of the court disgraces of  its author.    Freret, when imprisoned in the Bastile, was permitted only to have Bayle  for his companion. His dictionary was always before him, and his  principles were got by heart. To this circumstance we owe his works,  animated by all the powers of scepticism.    Sir William Davenant finished his poem of Gondibert during his  confinement by the rebels in Carisbrook Castle. George Withers dedicates  his \"Shepherds Hunting,\" \"To his friends, my visitants in the  Marshalsea:\" these \"eclogues\" having been printed in his  imprisonment.[20]    De Foe, confined in Newgate for a political pamphlet, began his  \"Review;\" a periodical paper, which was extended to nine thick volumes  in quarto, and it has been supposed served as the model of the  celebrated papers of Steele.    Wicquefort's curious work \"on Ambassadors\" is dated from his prison,  where he had been confined for state affairs. He softened the rigour of  those heavy hours by several historical works.    One of the most interesting facts of this kind is the fate of an Italian  scholar, of the name of Maggi. Early addicted to the study of the  sciences, and particularly to the mathematics, and military  architecture, he successfully defended Famagusta, besieged by the  Turks, by inventing machines which destroyed their works. When that city  was taken in 1571, they pillaged his library and carried him away in  chains. Now a slave, after his daily labours he amused a great part of  his nights by literary compositions; _De Tintinnabulis_, on Bells, a  treatise still read by the curious, was actually composed by him when a  slave in Turkey, without any other resource than the erudition of his  own memory, and the genius of which adversity could not deprive him.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 20: Withers, throughout these unique eclogues, which are  supposed to narrate the discourses of \"friendly shepherds\" who visit  him--                                      \"--pent      Within the jaws of strict imprisonment;      A forlorn shepherd void of all the means,      Whereon man's common hope in danger leads\"    --is still upheld by the same consciousness of rectitude which inspired  Sir Richard Lovelace in his better-known address \"To Althea from  Prison.\" Withers' poem was published before Lovelace was born. A few  lines from Withers will display this similarity. Speaking of his  enemies, he says:--        \"They may do much, but when they have done all,      Only my body they may bring in thrall.      And 'tis not that, my Willy; 'tis my mind,      My mind's more precious freedom I so weigh,      A thousand ways they may my body bind,      In thousand thralls, but ne'er my mind betray:      And hence it is that I contentment find,      And bear with patience this my load away:      I'm still myself, and that I'd rather be.      Than to be lord of all these downs in fee.\"]          AMUSEMENTS OF THE LEARNED.      Among the Jesuits it was a standing rule of the order, that after an  application to study for two hours, the mind of the student should be  unbent by some relaxation, however trifling. When Petavius was employed  in his _Dogmata Theologica_, a work of the most profound and extensive  erudition, the great recreation of the learned father was, at the end of  every second hour, to twirl his chair for five minutes. After protracted  studies Spinosa would mix with the family-party where he lodged, and  join in the most trivial conversations, or unbend his mind by setting  spiders to fight each other; he observed their combats with so much  interest, that he was often seized with immoderate fits of laughter. A  continuity of labour deadens the soul, observes Seneca, in closing his  treatise on \"The Tranquillity of the Soul,\" and the mind must unbend  itself by certain amusements. Socrates did not blush to play with  children; Cato, over his bottle, found an alleviation from the fatigues  of government; a circumstance, Seneca says in his manner, which rather  gives honour to this defect, than the defect dishonours Cato. Some men  of letters portioned out their day between repose and labour. Asinius  Pollio would not suffer any business to occupy him beyond a stated hour;  after that time he would not allow any letter to be opened, that his  hours of recreation might not be interrupted by unforeseen labours. In  the senate, after the tenth hour, it was not allowed to make any new  motion.    Tycho Brahe diverted himself with polishing glasses for all kinds of  spectacles, and making mathematical instruments; an employment too  closely connected with his studies to be deemed an amusement.    D'Andilly, the translator of Josephus, after seven or eight hours of  study every day, amused himself in cultivating trees; Barclay, the  author of the Argenis, in his leisure hours was a florist; Balzac amused  himself with a collection of crayon portraits; Peirese found his  amusement amongst his medals and antiquarian curiosities; the Abbe de  Marolles with his prints; and Politian in singing airs to his lute.  Descartes passed his afternoons in the conversation of a few friends,  and in cultivating a little garden; in the morning, occupied by the  system of the world, he relaxed his profound speculations by rearing  delicate flowers.    Conrad ab Uffenbach, a learned German, recreated his mind, after severe  studies, with a collection of prints of eminent persons, methodically  arranged; he retained this ardour of the _Grangerite_ to his last days.    Rohault wandered from shop to shop to observe the mechanics labour;  Count Caylus passed his mornings in the _studios_ of artists, and his  evenings in writing his numerous works on art. This was the true life of  an amateur.    Granville Sharp, amidst the severity of his studies, found a social  relaxation in the amusement of a barge on the Thames, which was well  known to the circle of his friends; there, was festive hospitality with  musical delight. It was resorted to by men of the most eminent talents  and rank. His little voyages to Putney, to Kew, and to Richmond, and the  literary intercourse they produced, were singularly happy ones. \"The  history of his amusements cannot be told without adding to the dignity  of his character,\" observes Prince Hoare, in the life of this great  philanthropist.    Some have found amusement in composing treatises on odd subjects. Seneca  wrote a burlesque narrative of Claudian's death. Pierius Valerianus has  written an eulogium on beards; and we have had a learned one recently,  with due gravity and pleasantry, entitled \"Eloge de Perruques.\"    Holstein has written an eulogium on the North Wind; Heinsius, on \"the  Ass;\" Menage, \"the Transmigration of the Parasitical Pedant to a  Parrot;\" and also the \"Petition of the Dictionaries.\"    Erasmus composed, to amuse himself when travelling, his panegyric on  _Moria_, or folly; which, authorised by the pun, he dedicated to Sir  Thomas More.    Sallengre, who would amuse himself like Erasmus, wrote, in imitation of  his work, a panegyric on _Ebriety_. He says, that he is willing to be  thought as drunken a man as Erasmus was a foolish one. Synesius composed  a Greek panegyric on _Baldness_. These burlesques were brought into  great vogue by Erasmus's _Moriae Encomium_.    It seems, Johnson observes in his life of Sir Thomas Browne, to have  been in all ages the pride of art to show how it could exalt the low and  amplify the little. To this ambition, perhaps, we owe the Frogs of  Homer; the Gnat and the Bees of Virgil; the Butterfly of Spenser; the  Shadow of Wowerus; and the Quincunx of Browne.    Cardinal de Richelieu, amongst all his great occupations, found a  recreation in violent exercises; and he was once discovered jumping with  his servant, to try who could reach the highest side of a wall. De  Grammont, observing the cardinal to be jealous of his powers, offered to  jump with him; and, in the true spirit of a courtier, having made some  efforts which nearly reached the cardinal's, confessed the cardinal  surpassed him. This was jumping like a politician; and by this means he  is said to have ingratiated himself with the minister.    The great Samuel Clarke was fond of robust exercise; and this profound  logician has been found leaping over tables and chairs. Once perceiving  a pedantic fellow, he said, \"Now we must desist, for a fool is coming  in!\"[21]    An eminent French"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#18)"],[1,"e?  To answer this  vital question it behooves us to seek the nature and cause of crimes,  the methods employed in coping with them, and the effects these  methods produce in ridding society of the curse and horror of crimes.    First, as to the NATURE of crime:    Havelock Ellis divides crime into four phases, the political, the  passional, the insane, and the occasional.  He says that the  political criminal is the victim of an attempt of a more or less  despotic government to preserve its own stability.  He is not  necessarily guilty of an unsocial offense; he simply tries to  overturn a certain political order which may itself be anti-social.  This truth is recognized all over the world, except in America where  the foolish notion still prevails that in a Democracy there is no  place for political criminals.  Yet John Brown was a political  criminal; so were the Chicago Anarchists; so is every striker.  Consequently, says Havelock Ellis, the political criminal of our time  or place may be the hero, martyr, saint of another age.  Lombroso  calls the political criminal the true precursor of the progressive  movement of humanity.    \"The criminal by passion is usually a man of wholesome birth and  honest life, who under the stress of some great, unmerited wrong has  wrought justice for himself.\"[2]    Mr. Hugh C. Weir, in THE MENACE OF THE POLICE, cites the case of Jim  Flaherty, a criminal by passion, who, instead of being saved by  society, is turned into a drunkard and a recidivist, with a ruined  and poverty-stricken family as the result.    A more pathetic type is Archie, the victim in Brand Whitlock's novel,  THE TURN OF THE BALANCE, the greatest American expose of crime in the  making.  Archie, even more than Flaherty, was driven to crime and  death by the cruel inhumanity of his surroundings, and by the  unscrupulous hounding of the machinery of the law.  Archie and  Flaherty are but the types of many thousands, demonstrating how the  legal aspects of crime, and the methods of dealing with it, help to  create the disease which is undermining our entire social life.    \"The insane criminal really can no more be considered a criminal than  a child, since he is mentally in the same condition as an infant or  an animal.\"[3]    The law already recognizes that, but only in rare cases of a very  flagrant nature, or when the culprit's wealth permits the luxury of  criminal insanity.  It has become quite fashionable to be the victim  of paranoia.  But on the whole the \"sovereignty of justice\" still  continues to punish criminally insane with the whole severity of its  power.  Thus Mr. Ellis quotes from Dr. Richter's statistics showing  that in Germany, one hundred and six madmen, out of one hundred and  forty-four criminal insane, were condemned to severe punishment.    The occasional criminal \"represents by far the largest class of our  prison population, hence is the greatest menace to social  well-being.\"  What is the cause that compels a vast army of the human  family to take to crime, to prefer the hideous life within prison  walls to the life outside?  Certainly that cause must be an iron  master, who leaves its victims no avenue of escape, for the most  depraved human being loves liberty.    This terrific force is conditioned in our cruel social and economic  arrangement.  I do not mean to deny the biologic, physiologic, or  psychologic factors in creating crime; but there is hardly an  advanced criminologist who will not concede that the social and  economic influences are the most relentless, the most poisonous germs  of crime.  Granted even that there are innate criminal tendencies, it  is none the less true that these tendencies find rich nutrition in  our social environment.    There is close relation, says Havelock Ellis, between crimes against  the person and the price of alcohol, between crimes against property  and the price of wheat.  He quotes Quetelet and Lacassagne, the  former looking upon society as the preparer of crime, and the  criminals as instruments that execute them.  The latter find that  \"the social environment is the cultivation medium of criminality;  that the criminal is the microbe, an element which only becomes  important when it finds the medium which causes it to ferment; EVERY  SOCIETY HAS THE CRIMINALS IT DESERVES.\"[4]    The most \"prosperous\" industrial period makes it impossible for the  worker to earn enough to keep up health and vigor.  And as prosperity  is, at best, an imaginary condition, thousands of people are  constantly added to the host of the unemployed.  From East to West,  from South to North, this vast army tramps in search of work or food,  and all they find is the workhouse or the slums.  Those who have a  spark of self-respect left, prefer open defiance, prefer crime to the  emaciated, degraded position of poverty.    Edward Carpenter estimates that five-sixths of indictable crimes  consist in some violation of property rights; but that is too low a  figure.  A thorough investigation would prove that nine crimes out of  ten could be traced, directly or indirectly, to our economic and  social iniquities, to our system of remorseless exploitation and  robbery.  There is no criminal so stupid but recognizes this terrible  fact, though he may not be able to account for it.    A collection of criminal philosophy, which Havelock Ellis, Lombroso,  and other eminent men have compiled, shows that the criminal feels  only too keenly that it is society that drives him to crime.  A  Milanese thief said to Lombroso: \"I do not rob, I merely take from  the rich their superfluities; besides, do not advocates and merchants  rob?\"  A murderer wrote: \"Knowing that three-fourths of the social  virtues are cowardly vices, I thought an open assault on a rich man  would be less ignoble than the cautious combination of fraud.\"  Another wrote: \"I am imprisoned for stealing a half dozen eggs.  Ministers who rob millions are honored.  Poor Italy!\" An educated  convict said to Mr. Davitt: \"The laws of society are framed for the  purpose of securing the wealth of the world to power and calculation,  thereby depriving the larger portion of mankind of its rights and  chances.  Why should they punish me for taking by somewhat similar  means from those who have taken more than they had a right to?\"  The  same man added: \"Religion robs the soul of its independence;  patriotism is the stupid worship of the world for which the  well-being and the peace of the inhabitants were sacrificed by those  who profit by it, while the laws of the land, in restraining natural  desires, were waging war on the manifest spirit of the law of our  beings.  Compared with this,\" he concluded, \"thieving is an honorable  pursuit.\"[5]    Verily, there is greater truth in this philosophy than in all the  law-and-moral books of society.      The economic, political, moral, and physical factors being the  microbes of crime, how does society meet the situation?    The methods of coping with crime have no doubt undergone several  changes, but mainly in a theoretic sense.  In practice, society has  retained the primitive motive in dealing with the offender; that is,  revenge.  It has also adopted the theologic idea; namely, punishment;  while the legal and \"civilized\" methods consist of deterrence or  terror, and reform.  We shall presently see that all four modes have  failed utterly, and that we are today no nearer a solution than in  the dark ages.    The natural impulse of the primitive man to strike back, to avenge a  wrong, is out of date.  Instead, the civilized man, stripped of  courage and daring, has delegated to an organized machinery the duty  of avenging his wrongs, in the foolish belief that the State is  justified in doing what he no longer has the manhood or consistency  to do.  The majesty-of-the-law is a reasoning thing; it would not  stoop to primitive instincts.  Its mission is of a \"higher\" nature.  True, it is still steeped in the theologic muddle, which proclaims  punishment as a means of purification, or the vicarious atonement of  sin.  But legally and socially the statute exercises punishment, not  merely as an infliction of pain upon the offender, but also for its  terrifying effect upon others.    What is the real basis of punishment, however?  The notion of a free  will, the idea that man is at all times a free agent for good or  evil; if he chooses the latter, he must be made to pay the price.  Although this theory has long been exploded, and thrown upon the  dustheap, it continues to be applied daily by the entire machinery of  government, turning it into the most cruel and brutal tormentor of  human life.  The only reason for its continuance is the still more  cruel notion that the greater the terror punishment spreads, the more  certain its preventative effect.    Society is using the most drastic methods in dealing with the social  offender.  Why do they not deter?  Although in America a man is  supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty, the  instruments of law, the police, carry on a reign of terror, making  indiscriminate arrests, beating, clubbing, bullying people, using the  barbarous method of the \"third degree,\" subjecting their unfortunate  victims to the foul air of the station house, and the still fouler  language of its guardians.  Yet crimes are rapidly multiplying, and  society is paying the price.  On the other hand, it is an open secret  that when the unfortunate citizen has been given the full \"mercy\" of  the law, and for the sake of safety is hidden in the worst of hells,  his real Calvary begins.  Robbed of his rights as a human being,  degraded to a mere automaton without will or feeling, dependent  entirely upon the mercy of brutal keepers, he daily goes through a  process of dehumanization, compared with which savage revenge was  mere child's play.    There is not a single penal institution or reformatory in the United  States where men are not"]]]
