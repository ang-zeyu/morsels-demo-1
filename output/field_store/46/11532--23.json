[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#18)"],[1," of the ode  which a singer like the one below is reciting. The fragment is much  abraded, and its details, not being clearly exhibited, have rather to  be guessed at; but the defaced aspect which time has produced is of some  service to it, since it conceals in some respect the rudeness of  its workmanship. The statues, on the other hand, bear evidence of a  precision of chiselling and a skill beyond question. Not that there are  no faults to be found in the work. They are squat, thick, and heavy  in form, and seem oppressed by the weight of the woollen covering with  which the Chaldeans enveloped themselves; when viewed closely, they  excite at once the wonder and repulsion of an eye accustomed to the  delicate grace, and at times somewhat slender form, which usually  characterized the good statues of the ancient and middle empire of  Egypt. But when we have got over the effect of first impressions, we can  but admire the audacity with which the artists attacked their material.  This is of hard dolerite, offering great resistance to the tool--harder,  perhaps, than the diorite out of which the Memphite sculptor had to  cut his Khephren: they succeeded in mastering it, and in handling it as  freely as if it were a block of limestone or marble.    [Illustration: 111.jpg Plan of the Ruins of Mughier]    The surface of the breast and back, the muscular development of the  shoulders and arms, the details of the hands and feet, all the nude  portions, are treated at once with a boldness and attention to minutiae  rarely met with in similar works. The pose is lacking in variety; the  individual, whether male or female, is sometimes represented standing  and sometimes sitting on a low seat, the legs brought together, the bust  rising squarely from the hips, the hands crossed upon the breast, in a  posture of submission or respectful adoration. The mantle passes over  the left shoulder, leaving the right free, and is fastened on the right  breast, the drapery displaying awkward and inartistic folds: the latter  widens in the form of a funnel from top to bottom, being bell-shaped  around the lower part of the body, and barely leaves the ankles exposed.    [Illustration: 112.jpg STATUES FROM TELLOH. and HEAD OF ONE OF THE  STATUE OF GUDEA.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Heuzey-Sarzec.    All the large statues to be seen at the Louvre have lost their heads;  fortunately we possess a few separate heads. Some are completely shaven,  others wear a kind of turban affording shade to the forehead and eyes;  among them all we see the same qualities and defects which we find in  the bodies: a hardness of expression, heaviness, absence of vivacity,  and yet withal a vigour of reproduction and an accurate knowledge of  human anatomy. These are instances of what could be accomplished in a  city of secondary rank; better things were doubtless produced in the  great cities, such as Uru and Babylon. Chaldaean art, as we are able  to catch a glimpse of it in the monuments of Lagash, had neither the  litheness, nor animation, nor elegance of the Egyptian, but it was  nevertheless not lacking in force, breadth, and originality. Urningirsu  succeeded his father Gudea, to be followed rapidly by several successive  vicegerents, ending, it would appear, in Gala-lama. Their inscriptions  are short and insignificant, and show that they did not enjoy the same  resources or the same favour which enabled Gudea to reign gloriously.  The prosperity of Lagash decreased steadily under their administration,  and they were all the humble vassals of the King of Uru, Dungi, son of  Urbau; a fact which tends to make us regard Urbau as having been the  suzerain upon whom Gudea himself was dependent. Uru, the only city among  those of Lower Chaldaea which stands on the right bank of the Euphrates,  was a small but strong place, and favourably situated for becoming one  of the commercial and industrial centres in these distant ages. The  Wady Eummein, not far distant, brought to it the riches of Central and  Southern Arabia, gold, precious stones, gums, and odoriferous resins for  the exigencies of worship. Another route, marked out by wells, traversed  the desert to the land of the semi-fabulous Mashu, and from thence  perhaps penetrated as far as Southern Syria and the Sinaitic  Peninsula--Magan and Milukhkha on the shores of the Red Sea: this was  not the easiest but it was the most direct route for those bound for  Africa, and products of Egypt were no doubt carried along it in order  to reach in the shortest time the markets of Uru. The Euphrates now  runs nearly five miles to the north of the town, but from the regions  bordering the Black Sea.    [Illustration: 114.jpg Plan of the Ruins of Abu-Shahreyn]    In ancient times it was not so distant, but passed almost by its  gates. The cedars, cypresses, and pines of Amamis and the Lebanon,the  limestones, marbles, and hard stones of Upper Syria, were brought down  to it by boat; and probably also metals--iron, copper and lead.    The Shatt-el-Hai, moreover, poured its waters into the Euphrates almost  opposite the city, and opened up to it commercial relations with the  Upper and Middle Tigris. And this was not all; whilst some of its  boatmen used its canals and rivers as highways, another section made  their way to the waters of the Persian Gulf and traded with the ports on  its coast. Eridu, the only city which could have barred their access  to the sea, was a town given up to religion, and existed only for its  temples and its gods. It was not long before it fell under the influence  of its powerful neighbour, becoming the first port of call for vessels  proceeding up the Euphrates.    [Illustration: 115.jpg AN ARAB CROSSING THE TIGRIS IN A \"KUFA.\"]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Chesney.    In the time of the Greeks and Romans the Chaldaeans were accustomed  to navigate the Tigris either in round flat-bottomed boats, of little  draught--\"kufas,\" in fact--or on rafts placed upon inflated skins,  exactly similar in appearance and construction to the \"keleks\" of our  own day. These keleks were as much at home on the sea as upon the river,  and they may still be found in the Persian Gulf engaged in the coasting  trade. Doubtless many of these were included among the vessels of Uru  mentioned in the texts, but there were also among the latter those  long large rowing-boats with curved stem and stern, Egyptian in their  appearance, which are to be found roughly incised on some ancient  cylinders. These primitive fleets were not disposed to risk the  navigation of the open sea. They preferred to proceed slowly along the  shore, hugging it in all cases, except when it was necessary to reach  some group of neighbouring islands; many days of navigation were thus  required to make a passage which one of our smallest sail-boats would  effect in a few hours, and at the end of their longest voyages they  were not very distant from their point of departure. It would be a great  mistake to suppose them capable of sailing round Arabia and of fetching  blocks of stone by sea from the Sinaitic Peninsula; such an expedition,  which would have been dangerous even for Greek or Roman Galleys, would  have been simply impossible for them. If they ever crossed the Strait  of Ormuzd, it was an exceptional thing, their ordinary voyages being  confined within the limits of the gulf. The merchants of Uru were  accustomed to visit regularly the island of Dilmun, the land of Magan,  the countries of Milukhkha and Gubin; from these places they brought  cargoes of diorite for their sculptors, building-timber for their  architects, perfumes and metals transported from Yemen by land, and  possibly pearls from the Bahrein Islands. They encountered serious  rivalry from the sailors of Dilmun and Magan, whose maritime tribes were  then as now accustomed to scour the seas. The risk was great for those  who set out on such expeditions, perhaps never to return, but the profit  was considerable.    [Illustration: 117.jpg AN ASSYRIAN KELEK LADEN WITH BUILDING-STONE.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief from \"Kouyunjik\"       (Layard, _The Monuments of Nineveh_, 2nd series, pi. 13; cf.       Place, _Ninive et l'Assyrie_, pl. 43, No. 1.)    Uru, enriched by its commerce, was soon in a position to subjugate  the petty neighbouring states--Uruk, Larsam, Lagash, and Nipur. Its  territory formed a fairly extended sovereignty, whose lords entitled  themselves kings of Shumir and Akkad, and ruled over all Southern  Chaldaea for many centuries.    Several of these kings, the Lugalkigubnidudu and the Lugalkisalsi, of  whom some monuments have been preserved to us, seem to have extended  their influence beyond these limits prior to the time of Sargon the  Elder; and we can date the earliest of them with tolerable probability.  Urbau reigned some time about 2900 B.C. He was an energetic builder, and  material traces of his activity are to be found everywhere throughout  the country. The temple of the Sun at Larsam, the temple of Nina in  Uruk, and the temples of Inlilla and Ninlilla in Nipur were indebted  to him for their origin or restoration: he decorated or repaired  all structures which were not of his own erection: in Uru itself  the sanctuary of the moon-god owes its foundation to him, and the  fortifications of the city were his work. Dungi, his son, was an  indefatigable bricklayer, like his father: he completed the sanctuary  of the moon-god, and constructed buildings in Uruk, Lagash, and Kutha.  There is no indication in the inscriptions of his having been engaged  in any civil struggle or in war with a foreign nation; we should make a  serious mistake, however, if we concluded from this silence that peace  was not disturbed in his time. The tie which bound together the petty  states of which Uru was composed was of the slightest. The sovereign  could barely claim as his own more than the capital and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#18)"],[1,"took occasion, as  in the Heracleopolitan epoch, to pick a quarrel with their sovereign  lord, and did not allow themselves to be discouraged by any check.*         * The length of time during which Egypt was subject to       Asiatic rule is not fully known. Historians are agreed in       recognizing the three epochs referred to in the narrative of       Manetho as corresponding with (1) the conquest and the six       first Hyksos kings, including the XVth Theban dynasty; (2)       the complete submission of Egypt to the XVIth foreign       dynasty; (3) the war of independence during the XVIIth       dynasty, which consisted of two parallel series of kings,       the one Shepherds (Pharaohs), the other Thebans. There has       been considerable discussion as to the duration of the       oppression. The best solution is still that given by Erman,       according to whom the XVth dynasty lasted 284, the XVIth       234, and the XVIIth 143 years, or, in all, 661 years. The       invasion must, therefore, have taken place about 2346 B.C.,       or about the time when the Elamite power was at its highest.       The advent of the XVIth dynasty would fall about 2062 B.C.,       and the commencement of the war of independence between 1730       and 1720 B.C.    The period of hegemony attributed by the chronicles to the Hyksos of the  XVIth dynasty was not probably, as far as they were concerned, years of  perfect tranquillity, or of undisputed authority. In inscribing their  sole names on the lists, the compilers denoted merely the shorter  or longer period during which their Theban vassals failed in their  rebellious efforts, and did not dare to assume openly the title or  ensigns of royalty. A certain Apophis, probably the same who took the  prsenomen of Aqnunri, was reigning at Tanis when the decisive revolt  broke out, and Saqnunri Tiuaa I., who was the leader on the occasion,  had no other title of authority over the provinces of the south than  that of _hiqu,_ or regent. We are unacquainted with the cause of the  outbreak or with its sequel, and the Egyptians themselves seem to have  been not much better informed on the subject than ourselves. They gave  free flight to their fancy, and accommodated the details to their taste,  not shrinking from the introduction of daring fictions into the account.  A romance, which was very popular with the literati four or five hundred  years later, asserted that the real cause of the war was a kind of  religious quarrel. \"It happened that the land of Egypt belonged to  the Fever-stricken, and, as there was no supreme king at that time, it  happened then that King Saqnunri was regent of the city of the south,  and that the Fever-stricken of the city of Ra were under the rule of  Ra-Apopi in Avaris. The Whole Land tribute to the latter in manufactured  products, and the north did the same in all the good things of the  Delta. Now, the King Ra-Apopi took to himself Sutkhu for lord, and he  did not serve any other god in the Whole Land except Sutkhu, and he  built a temple of excellent and everlasting work at the gate of the King  Ra-Apopi, and he arose every morning to sacrifice the daily victims,  and the chief vassals were there with garlands of flowers, as it was  accustomed to be done for the temple of Phra-Harmakhis.\" Having finished  the temple, he thought of imposing upon the Thebans the cult of his god,  but as he shrank from employing force in such a delicate matter, he had  recourse to stratagem. He took counsel with his princes and generals,  but they were unable to propose any plan. The college of diviners and  scribes was more complaisant: \"Let a messenger go to the regent of the  city of the South to tell him: The King Ra-Apopi commands thee: 'That  the hippopotami which are in the pool of the town are to be exterminated  in the pool, in order that slumber may come to me by day and by night.'  He will not be able to reply good or bad, and thou shalt send him  another messenger: The King Ra-Apopi commands thee: 'If the chief of the  South does not reply to my message, let him serve no longer any god but  Sutkhu. But if he replies to it, and will do that which I tell him  to do, then I will impose nothing further upon him, and I will not in  future bow before any other god of the Whole Land than Amonra, king of  the gods!'\" Another Pharaoh of popular romance, Nectanebo, possessed,  at a much later date, mares which conceived at the neighing of the  stallions of Babylon, and his friend Lycerus had a cat which went forth  every night to wring the necks of the cocks of Memphis:* the hippopotami  of the Theban lake, which troubled the rest of the King of Tanis, were  evidently of close kin to these extraordinary animals.         * Found in a popular story, which came in later times to be       associated with the traditions connected with AEsop.    The sequel is unfortunately lost. We may assume, however, without much  risk of error, that Saqnunri came forth safe and sound from the ordeal;  that Apopi was taken in his own trap, and saw himself driven to the dire  extremity of giving up Sutkhu for Amonra or of declaring war. He was  likely to adopt the latter alternative, and the end of the manuscript  would probably have related his defeat.    [Illustration: 106.jpg PALLATE OF Tiuaa]         Drawn from the original by Faucher-Gudin.    Hostilities continued for a century and a half from the time when  Saqnunri Tiuaa declared himself son of the Sun and king of the  two Egypts. From the moment in which he surrounded his name with a  cartouche, the princes of the Said threw in their lot with him, and the  XVIIth dynasty had its beginning on the day of his proclamation. The  strife at first was undecisive and without marked advantage to either  side: at length the Pharaoh whom the Greek copyists of Manetho call  Alisphragmouthosis, defeated the barbarians, drove them away from  Memphis and from the western plains of the Delta, and shut them up in  their entrenched camp at Avaris, between the Sebennytic branch of the  Nile and the Wady Tumilat. The monuments bearing on this period of  strife and misery are few in number, and it is a fortunate circumstance  if some insignificant object tarns up which would elsewhere be passed  over as unworthy of notice. One of the officials of Tiuaa I. has left us  his writing palette, on which the cartouches of his master are incised  with a rudeness baffling description.    We have also information of a prince of the blood, a king's son, Tuau,  who accompanied this same Pharaoh in his expeditions; and the Gizeh  Museum is proud of having in its possession the i wooden sabre which  this individual placed on the mummy of a certain Aqhoru, to enable him  to defend himself against the monsters of the lower world. A second  Saqnunri Tiuaa succeeded the first, and like him was buried in a little  brick pyramid on the border of the Theban necropolis. At his death the  series of rulers was broken, and we meet with several names which  are difficult to classify--Sakhontinibri, Sanakhtu-niri, Hotpuri,  Manhotpuri, Eahotpu.*         * Hotpuri and Manhotpuri are both mentioned in the fragments       of a fantastic story (copied during the XXth dynasty), bits       of which are found in most European museums. In one of these       fragments, preserved in the Louvre, mention is made of       Hotpuri's tomb, certainly situated at Thebes; we possess       scarabs of this king, and Petrie discovered at Coptos a       fragment of a stele bearing his name and titles, and       describing the works which he executed in the temples of the       town. The XIVth year of Manhotpuri is mentioned in a passage       of the story as being the date of the death of a personage       born under Hotpuri. These two kings belong, as far as we are       able to judge, to the middle of the XVIIth dynasty; I am       inclined to place beside them the Pharaoh Nubhotpuri, of       whom we possess a few rather coarse scarabs.    As we proceed, however, information becomes more plentiful, and the list  of reigns almost complete. The part which the princesses of older  times played in the transmission of power had, from the XIIth dynasty  downward, considerably increased in importance, and threatened to  overshadow that of the princes. The question presents itself whether,  during these centuries of perpetual warfare, there had not been a moment  when, all the males of the family having perished, the women alone  were left to perpetuate the solar race on the earth and to keep the  succession unbroken. As soon as the veil over this period of history  begins to be lifted, we distinguish among the personages emerging from  the obscurity as many queens as kings presiding over the destinies of  Egypt. The sons took precedence of the daughters when both were the  offspring of a brother and sister born of the same parents, and when,  consequently, they were of equal rank; but, on the other hand, the sons  forfeited this equality when there was any inferiority in origin on the  maternal side, and their prospect of succession to the throne diminished  in proportion to their mother's remoteness from the line of Ra. In the  latter case all their sisters, born of marriages which to us appear  incestuous, took precedence of them, and the eldest daughter became the  legitimate Pharaoh, who sat in the seat of Horus on the death of her  father, or even occasionally during his lifetime. The prince whom she  married governed for her, and discharged those royal duties which could  be legally performed by a man only,--such as offering worship to the  supreme gods, commanding the army, and administering justice; but his  wife never ceased to be sovereign, and however small the intelligence  or firmness of which she might be possessed, her husband was obliged  to leave to her, at all events on certain occasions, the direction of  affairs.
