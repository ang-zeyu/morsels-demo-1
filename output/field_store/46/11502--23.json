Swayed by the attraction of this giant globe, Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus  and Neptune, as well as the four minor planets, and the host of  asteroids, sweep continuously in their appointed orbits, in ever new but  ever safe and orderly relations amongst each other. If the sun's light  and heat were lost, all life and work among the denizens of these orbs  would at once cease; if his attractive energy were destroyed, these orbs  would cease to form a _system_.    The sun may be observed conveniently in many ways, some more suited to  the general observer who has not time or opportunity for systematic  observation; others more instructive, though involving more of  preparation and arrangement.    The simplest method of observing the sun is to use the telescope in the  ordinary manner, protecting the eye by means of dark-green or  neutral-tinted glasses. Some of the most interesting views I have ever  obtained of the sun, have resulted from the use of the ordinary  terrestrial or erecting eye-piece, capped with a dark glass. The  magnifying power of such an eye-piece is, in general, much lower than  that available with astronomical eye-pieces. But vision is very pleasant  and distinct when the sun is thus observed, and a patient scrutiny  reveals almost every feature which the highest astronomical power  applicable could exhibit. Then, owing to the greater number of  intervening lenses, there is not the same necessity for great darkness  or thickness in the coloured glass, so that the colours of the solar  features are seen much more satisfactorily than when astronomical  eye-pieces are employed.    In using astronomical eye-pieces it is convenient to have a rotating  wheel attached, by which darkening glasses of different power may be  brought into use as the varying illumination may require.    Those who wish to observe carefully and closely a minute portion of the  solar disc, should employ Dawes' eye-piece: in this a metallic screen  placed in the focus keeps away all light but such as passes through a  minute hole in the diaphragm.    Another convenient method of diminishing the light is to use a glass  prism, light being partially reflected from one of the exterior  surfaces, while the refracted portion is thrown out at another.    Very beautiful and interesting views may be obtained by using such a  pyramidal box as is depicted in fig. 11.    [Illustration: _Fig. 11._]    This box should be made of black cloth or calico fastened over a light  framework of wire or cane. The base of the pyramid should be covered on  the inside with a sheet of white glazed paper, or with some other  uniform white surface. Captain Noble, I believe, makes use of a surface  of plaster of Paris, smoothed while wet with plate-glass. The door _b  c_ enables the observer to \"change power\" without removing the box,  while larger doors, _d e_ and _g f_, enable him to examine the image; a  dark cloth, such as photographers use, being employed, if necessary, to  keep out extraneous light. The image may also be examined from without,  if the bottom of the pyramid be formed of a sheet of cut-glass or oiled  tissue-paper.    When making use of the method just described, it is very necessary that  the telescope-tube should be well balanced. A method by which this may  be conveniently accomplished has been already described in Chapter I.    But, undoubtedly, for the possessor of a moderately good telescope there  is no way of viewing the sun's features comparable to that now to be  described, which has been systematically and successfully applied for a  long series of years by the Rev. F. Howlett. To use his own words: \"Any  one possessing a good achromatic of not more than three inches'  aperture, who has a little dexterity with his pencil, and a little time  at his disposal (all the better if it be at a somewhat early hour of the  morning)\" may by this method \"deliberately and satisfactorily view,  measure, and (if skill suffice) delineate most of those interesting and  grand solar phenomena of which he may have read, or which he may have  seen depicted, in various works on physical astronomy.\"[15]    The method in question depends on the same property which is involved in  the use of the pyramidal box just described, supplemented (where exact  and systematic observation is required) by the fact that objects lying  on or between the lenses of the eye-piece are to be seen faithfully  projected on the white surface on which the sun's image is received. In  place, however, of a box carried upon the telescope-tube, a darkened  room (or true _camera obscura_) contains the receiving sheet.    A chamber is to be selected, having a window looking towards the  south--a little easterly, if possible, so as to admit of morning  observation. All windows are to be completely darkened save one, through  which the telescope is directed towards the sun. An arrangement is to be  adopted for preventing all light from entering by this window except  such light as passes down the tube of the telescope. This can readily be  managed with a little ingenuity. Mr. Howlett describes an excellent  method. The following, perhaps, will sufficiently serve the purposes of  the general observer:--A plain frame (portable) is to be constructed to  fit into the window: to the four sides of this frame triangular pieces  of cloth (impervious to light) are to be attached, their shape being  such that when their adjacent edges are sewn together and the flaps  stretched out, they form a rectangular pyramid of which the frame is the  base. Through the vertex of this pyramid (near which, of course, the  cloth flaps are not sewn together) the telescope tube is to be passed,  and an elastic cord so placed round the ends of the flaps as to prevent  any light from penetrating between them and the telescope. It will now  be possible, without disturbing the screen (fixed in the window), to  move the telescope so as to follow the sun during the time of  observation. And the same arrangement will serve for all seasons, if so  managed that the elastic cord is not far from the middle of the  telescope-tube; for in this case the range of motion is small compared  to the range of the tube's extremity.    A large screen of good drawing-paper should next be prepared. This  should be stretched on a light frame of wood, and placed on an easel,  the legs of which should be furnished with holes and pegs that the  screen may be set at any required height, and be brought square to the  tube's axis. A large T-square of light wood will be useful to enable the  observer to judge whether the screen is properly situated in the last  respect.    We wish now to direct the tube towards the sun, and this \"without  dazzling the eyes as by the ordinary method.\" This may be done in two  ways. We may either, before commencing work--that is, before fastening  our elastic cord so as to exclude all light--direct the tube so that its  shadow shall be a perfect circle (when of course it is truly directed),  then fasten the cord and afterwards we can easily keep the sun in the  field by slightly shifting the tube as occasion requires. Or (if the  elastic cord has already been fastened) we may remove the eye-tube and  shift the telescope-tube about--the direction in which the sun lies  being roughly known--until we see the spot of light received down the  telescope's axis grow brighter and brighter and finally become a _spot  of sun-light_. If a card be held near the focus of the telescope there  will be seen in fact an image of the sun. The telescope being now  properly directed, the eye-tube may be slipped in again, and the sun may  be kept in the field as before.    There will now be seen upon the screen a picture of the sun very  brilliant and pleasing, but perhaps a little out of focus. The focusing  should therefore next be attended to, the increase of clearness in the  image being the test of approach to the true focus. And again, it will  be well to try the effect of slight changes of distance between the  screen and the telescope's eye-piece. Mr. Howlett considers one yard as  a convenient distance for producing an excellent effect with almost any  eye-piece that the state of the atmosphere will admit of. Of course, the  image becomes more sharply defined if we bring the screen nearer to the  telescope, while all the details are enlarged when we move the screen  away. The enlargement has no limits save those depending on the amount  of light in the image. But, of course, the observer must not expect  enlargement to bring with it a view of new details, after a certain  magnitude of image has been attained. Still there is something  instructive, I think, in occasionally getting a very magnified view of  some remarkable spot. I have often looked with enhanced feelings of awe  and wonder on the gigantic image of a solar spot thrown by means of the  diagonal eye-piece upon the ceiling of the observing-room. Blurred and  indistinct through over-magnifying, yet with a new meaning to me,  _there_ the vast abysm lies pictured; vague imaginings of the vast and  incomprehensible agencies at work in the great centre of our system  crowd unbidden into my mind; and I seem to _feel_--not merely think  about--the stupendous grandeur of that life-emitting orb.    To return, however, to observation:--By slightly shifting the tube,  different parts of the solar disc can be brought successively upon the  screen and scrutinized as readily as if they were drawn upon a chart.  \"With a power of--say about 60 or 80 linear--the most minute solar spot,  properly so called, that is capable of formation\" (Mr. Howlett believes  \"they are never less than three seconds in length or breadth) will be  more readily detected than by any other method,\" see Plate 7; \"as also  will any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16772"],[0,"The Story of a Soul (L'Histoire d'une Âme): The Autobiography of St. Thérèse of (#18)"],[1,"by the wretched prisoners as they passed from their  dungeons to sentence and to death. After leaving Venice we visited  Padua and there venerated the relic of St. Anthony's tongue; then  Bologna, where St. Catherine's body rests. Her face still bears  the impress of the kiss bestowed on her by the Infant Jesus.    I was indeed happy when on the way to Loreto. Our Lady had chosen  an ideal spot in which to place her Holy House. Everything is  poor, simple, and primitive; the women still wear the graceful  dress of the country and have not, as in the large towns, adopted  the modern Paris fashions. I found Loreto enchanting. And what  shall I say of the Holy House? I was overwhelmed with emotion when  I realised that I was under the very roof that had sheltered the  Holy Family. I gazed on the same walls Our Lord had looked on. I  trod the ground once moistened with the sweat of St. Joseph's  toil, and saw the little chamber of the Annunciation, where the  Blessed Virgin Mary held Jesus in her arms after she had borne Him  there in her virginal womb. I even put my Rosary into the little  porringer used by the Divine Child. How sweet those memories!    But our greatest joy was to receive Jesus in His own House, and  thus become His living temple in the very place which He had  honoured by His Divine Presence. According to Roman custom the  Blessed Sacrament is reserved at one Altar in each Church, and  there only is it given to the faithful. At Loreto this Altar was  in the Basilica--which is built round the Holy House, enclosing it  as a precious stone might be enclosed in a casket of white marble.  The exterior mattered little to us, it was in the _diamond_ itself  that we wished to receive the Bread of Angels. My Father, with his  habitual gentleness, followed the other pilgrims, but his  daughters, less easily satisfied, went towards the Holy House.    God favoured us, for a Priest was on the point of celebrating  Mass; we told him of our great wish, and he immediately asked for  two hosts, which he placed on the paten. You may picture, dear  Mother, the ecstatic happiness of that Communion; no words can  describe it. What will be our joy when we communicate eternally in  the dwelling of the King of Heaven? It will be undimmed by the  grief of parting, and will know no end. His House will be ours for  all eternity, and there will be no need to covet fragments from  the walls hallowed by the Divine Presence. He will not give us His  earthly Home--He only shows it to us to make us love poverty and  the hidden life. What He has in store for us is the Palace of His  Glory, where we shall no longer see Him veiled under the form of a  child or the appearance of bread, but as He is, in the brightness  of His Infinite Beauty.    Now I am going to tell you about Rome--Rome, where I thought to  find comfort and where I found the cross. It was night when we  arrived. I was asleep, and was awakened by the porters calling:  \"Roma!\" The pilgrims caught up the cry and repeated: \"Roma, Roma!\"  Then I knew that it was not a dream, I was really in Rome!    Our first day, and perhaps the most enjoyable, was spent outside  the walls. There, everything retains its stamp of antiquity,  whilst in Rome, with its hotels and shops, one might fancy oneself  in Paris. This drive in the Roman Campagna has left a specially  delightful impression on my mind.    How shall I describe the feelings which thrilled me when I gazed  on the Coliseum? At last I saw the arena where so many Martyrs had  shed their blood for Christ. My first impulse was to kiss the  ground sanctified by their glorious combats. But what a  disappointment! The soil has been raised, and the real arena is  now buried at the depth of about twenty-six feet.    As the result of excavations the centre is nothing but a mass of  rubbish, and an insurmountable barrier guards the entrance; in any  case no one dare penetrate into the midst of these dangerous  ruins. But was it possible to be in Rome and not go down to the  real Coliseum? No, indeed! And I no longer listened to the guide's  explanations: one thought only filled my mind--I must reach the  arena.    We are told in the Gospel that St. Mary Magdalen remained close to  the Sepulchre and stooped down constantly to look in; she was  rewarded by seeing two Angels. So, like her, I kept stooping down  and I saw, not two Angels, but what I was in search of. I uttered  a cry of joy and called out to my sister: \"Come, follow me, we  shall be able to get through.\" We hurried on at once, scrambling  over the ruins which crumbled under our feet. Papa, aghast at our  boldness, called out to us, but we did not hear.    As the warriors of old felt their courage grow in face of peril,  so our joy increased in proportion to the fatigue and danger we  had to face to attain the object of our desires. Celine, more  foreseeing than I, had listened to the guide. She remembered that  he had pointed out a particular stone marked with a cross, and had  told us it was the place where the Martyrs had fought the good  fight. She set to work to find it, and having done so we threw  ourselves on our knees on this sacred ground. Our souls united in  one and the same prayer. My heart beat violently when I pressed my  lips to the dust reddened with the blood of the early Christians.  I begged for the grace to be a martyr for Jesus, and I felt in the  depths of my heart that my prayer was heard. All this took but a  short time. After collecting some stones we approached the walls  once more to face the danger. We were so happy that Papa had not  the heart to scold us, and I could see that he was proud of our  courage.    From the Coliseum we went to the Catacombs, and there Celine and I  laid ourselves down in what had once been the tomb of St. Cecilia,  and took some of the earth sanctified by her holy remains. Before  our journey to Rome I had not felt any special devotion to St.  Cecilia, but on visiting the house where she was martyred, and  hearing her proclaimed \"Queen of harmony\"--because of the sweet  song she sang in her heart to her Divine Spouse--I felt more than  devotion towards her, it was real love as for a friend. She became  my chosen patroness, and the keeper of all my secrets; her  abandonment to God and her boundless confidence delighted me  beyond measure. They were so great that they enabled her to make  souls pure which had never till then desired aught but earthly  pleasures.    St. Cecilia is like the Spouse in the Canticles. I find in her the  Scriptural \"choir in an armed camp.\"[10] Her life was one  melodious song in the midst of the greatest trials; and this is  not strange, because we read that \"the Book of the Holy Gospels  lay ever on her heart,\"[11] while in her heart reposed the Spouse  of Virgins.    Our visit to the Church of St. Agnes was also very delightful. I  tried, but without success, to obtain a relic to take back to my  little Mother, Sister Agnes of Jesus. Men refused me, but God  Himself came to my aid: a little bit of red marble, from an  ancient mosaic dating back to the time of the sweet martyr, fell  as my feet. Was this not touching? St. Agnes herself gave me a  keepsake from her house.    We spent six days in visiting the great wonders in Rome, and on  the seventh saw the greatest of all--Leo XIII. I longed for, yet  dreaded, that day, for on it depended my vocation. I had received  no answer from the Bishop of Bayeux, and so the Holy Father's  permission was my one and only hope. But in order to obtain this  permission I had first to ask it. The mere thought made me  tremble, for I must dare speak to the Pope, and that, in presence  of many Cardinals, Archbishops, and Bishops!    On Sunday morning, November 20, we went to the Vatican, and were  taken to the Pope's private chapel. At eight o'clock we assisted  at his Mass, during which his fervent piety, worthy of the Vicar  of Christ, gave evidence that he was in truth the \"Holy Father.\"    The Gospel for that day contained these touching words: \"Fear not,  little flock, for it hath pleased your Father to give you a  Kingdom.\"[12] My heart was filled with perfect confidence. No, I  would not fear, I would trust that the Kingdom of the Carmel would  soon be mine. I did not think of those other words of Our Lord: \"I  dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to Me, a Kingdom.\"[13]  That is to say, I will give you crosses and trials, and thus will  you become worthy to possess My Kingdom. _If you desire to sit on  His right hand you must drink the chalice which He has drunk  Himself._[14] \"Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and  so to enter into His glory?\"[15]    A Mass of thanksgiving followed, and then the audience began. Leo  XIII, whose cassock and cape were of white, was seated on a raised  chair, and round him were grouped various dignitaries of the  church. According to custom each visitor knelt in turn and kissed,  first the foot and next the hand of the venerable Pontiff, and  finally received his blessing; then two of the Noble Guard signed  to the pilgrim that he must rise and pass on to the adjoining room  to make way for those who followed.    No one uttered a word, but I was firmly determined to speak, when  suddenly the Vicar-General of Bayeux, Father Reverony, who was  standing at the Pope's right hand, told us in a loud voice that he  absolutely forbade anyone to address the Holy Father. My heart  beat fast. I turned to Celine, mutely inquiring what I should do.  \"Speak!\" she said.    The next moment I found myself on my knees before the Holy Father.  I kissed his foot and he held out his hand; then raising my eyes,  which were filled with tears, I said entreatingly: \"Holy Father, I  have a great favour to ask you.\" At once he bent towards me till  his face almost touched mine, and his piercing black eyes seemed  to read my very soul. \"Holy Father,\" I repeated, \"in honour of  your jubilee, will you allow me to"]]]
