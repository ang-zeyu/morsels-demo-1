[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#18)"],[1,"is vitally linked with the fortunes of a world-encircling Order,  functioning mysteriously in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres,  highly organized in its administrative machinery, sensitive in its  mechanism, far-flung in its ramifications, challenging in its features,  revolutionizing in its implications, and destined to seek increasingly, as  it expands and develops, the good-will and assistance of the civil  authorities in every continent of the globe.    The number of pioneers, both from among the veterans of the Faith who have  participated in the early establishment of this infant Order in the  Antipodes, and the new believers who have embraced its Cause, must, if  this task is to be successfully carried out, be substantially increased.  The flow of funds to both the local and national treasuries must  correspondingly be augmented and systematically sustained. The heroism and  self-sacrifice of those who prosecute the Plan, both as administrators and  pioneers, must attain greater heights and engender still more powerful  forces in the spiritual life of this community.    The relationship binding it to the civil authorities of the Australian  Commonwealth, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Island of Tasmania, must  be assiduously fostered. The ties linking it with the members of the  world-wide community of the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, must be  rapidly strengthened and multiplied. The unity and solidarity of its  constituent members must be simultaneously reinforced, its roots  permanently planted in the soil of the Covenants of both Baha'u'llah and  'Abdu'l-Baha, its branches spread out irresistibly to the furthest ends of  that far-off continent, its vision clarified, its determination reaffirmed  and its consecration deepened.    Obstacles, varied and numerous, will no doubt arise to impede the onward  march of this community. Reverses may temporarily dim the radiance of its  mission. The forces of religious orthodoxy may well, at a future date, be  leagued against it. The exponents of theories and doctrines fundamentally  opposed to its religious tenets and social principles may challenge its  infant strength with persistence and severity. The Administrative  Order--the Ark destined to preserve its integrity and carry it to  safety--must without delay, without exception, claim the attention of the  members of this community, its ideals must be continually cherished in  their hearts, its purposes studied and kept constantly before their eyes,  its requirements wholeheartedly met, its laws scrupulously upheld, its  institutions unstintingly supported, its glorious mission noised abroad,  and its spirit made the sole motivating purpose of their lives.    Then and only then, will this community, so young, so vibrant with life,  so rich in promise, so dedicated to its task, be in a position to  discharge adequately its weighty responsibilities, to reap the full  harvest it has sown, acquire still greater potentialities for the conduct  of subsequent stages in the crusade on which it has embarked, and  contribute, to a degree unsuspected as yet by its members, its full share  to the World-wide establishment of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, the  emancipation of its Oriental followers, the recognition of its  independence, the birth of its World Order and the emergence of that world  civilization which that Order is destined to create.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF 4 SEPTEMBER, 1949      N.S.A. of Australia and New Zealand, Mrs. Mariette Bolton, Secretary.    4 September, 1949.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    This is just a little note to ask you, on behalf of our beloved Guardian,  to please make the following corrections in a quotation of his words,  published in the August number of your Baha'i News Bulletin, on page 5:  \"As the processes impelling\" (not \"in filling\"); in the sentence lower  down, reading: \"the deepening of the faith, understanding and spiritual  life...\" both \"faith\" and \"spiritual\" should not be capitalized, but be  printed as I have written them above; after the words \"this historic  evolution\" there should be a period, as it is the end of the sentence.    Hoping you received the long letter recently mailed you, and with loving  Baha'i greetings,    Yours,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. He wishes to thank you and dear Mr. Bolton for the loving gift of  Bolton Place to the Baha'i Community of Australia. This is an excellent  example, and befitting gesture, for it has many associations with the  spread and development of the Faith in Australia, and has further enriched  the record of your historic services to the Faith.            LETTER OF JUNE 28, 1950      The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand.    June 28, 1950.    Dear Baha'i Friends:    Your letters of August 9, 19; September 14, 22; November 7, 10, 21; of  1949; January 19; February 28; March 8, 31; April 11; May 2 (two), 1950,  have been received by our beloved Guardian and he has instructed me to  answer them on his behalf. The many enclosures and material forwarded  have, likewise, been safely received.    It has been impossible for our Guardian to keep abreast of his  correspondence and other work this Winter and Spring. It is only during  the last week that he has been able to turn to the mountain of mail,  representing the correspondence of the various National Assemblies, and  commence replying. The reason for this regrettable delay is that in order  to get the arcade of the Shrine of the Bab finished in time for the  centenary of His Martyrdom he had to undertake extensive excavations into  the solid rock of the mountain behind the Shrine--the new edifice being  much larger than the precious original building it is designed to enshrine  and protect. This work he personally supervised in order to ensure the  Shrine was in no way damaged, and to see the cost was kept within bounds.  You can imagine this was a very exacting and tiring ordeal for him.    Then, just as he had hoped to take up his overburdening correspondence,  Mr. Maxwell, the architect of the Shrine, at the beginning of April became  desperately ill, and for ten weeks absorbed the anxious care and attention  of us all, as his condition was seemingly hopeless. Thanks to the Mercy of  Baha'u'llah and the determination of the Guardian, he is recovering, and  our lives are getting back to normal routine.    The Guardian regrets very much the conduct of Mr. ...; it seems now fairly  clear that he is a former Baha'i from India who misconducted himself there  over a period of years and then showed up, under a different name, in  Australia. No one who conducts himself as he has can remain a voting  member of the Baha'i Community for--in spite of his wide knowledge of the  Faith and his belief in it--his acts are contrary to its teachings and  bring not only confusion into the Community and create inharmony, but  disgrace the Cause in the eyes of non-Baha'is.    The Guardian fully realizes that the process of splitting up large  communities into smaller ones, each existing within its own civil units,  has been difficult for the Australian friends. What they do not seem to  fully appreciate is that this has been done in Canada and the United  States as well, and is only in order to organize the assemblies on a  logical basis, and one with a firmer legal foundation. The fact that this  may create more assemblies in the end, and that it sometimes breaks up  existing ones, is only incidental; the important point is to consolidate  the communities on a sound basis, i.e. every assembly within the limits of  the Municipality its members reside in.    As Mrs Axford requested Mrs Thomas to write about her Baha'i life there is  every reason to respect her wishes. This in no way precludes the New  Zealand Community from writing about her services and life and keeping  this record in the National archives. The Guardian feels the Auckland  Assembly should be consulted, as her, (Mrs Axford's), home community, by  Mrs Thomas. He hopes this In Memoriam article, about so dear and tireless  a servant of the Faith, will produce a spirit of love and co-operation  amongst all concerned.    The gift by Miss Perks of an additional piece of land to the Yerrinbool  School is deeply appreciated. It enriches the endowments already held by  your Assembly. Please thank Miss Perks, on behalf of the Guardian, for  this generous contribution, to the institutions of the Faith in Australia,  and tell her he does not feel any name should be given the property other  that of Yerrinbool School, of which it will form a part, and that she will  always be remembered as the donor of it.    The acquisition of the site for the New Zealand Summer School was a great  step forward in the progress of the Faith there, and he was very pleased  about it. He was also delighted to hear of the formation of the Devonport  Assembly, and he hopes next year there will be still more.    I would also like to answer here a question raised in Mrs Bolton's letter  of March 8: the Guardian feels that no annual fixed pilgrimage should be  made to the grave of Father Dunn. The friends will naturally always want  to go there, when and how they like, but it must not become a ceremony,  otherwise it will contitute a precedent for similar things in the future.    It is premature, and will weaken the national and local work, for  delegates to be elected by State elections rather than by assemblies.  There is no question involved about believers losing their voting rights:  all the time believers are gaining and losing their voting rights by  becoming members of communities with assemblies or moving out into places  where they are isolated believers. The friends should not dwell on these  minor details, but concentrate on teaching the Cause and exemplifying the  Baha'i life. Voting is a purely administrative detail, but teaching and  serving are vital spiritual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#18)"],[1,"  the capacity to achieve its organic unification, attain maturity and  thereby reach the final stage in its age-long evolution. The clarion-call  addressed to the \"concourse of kings and of the sons of kings,\" marking  the inception of a process which, accelerated by Baha'u'llah's subsequent  warnings to the entire company of the monarchs of East and West, was to  produce so widespread a revolution in the fortunes of royalty, had been  raised in the Qayyumu'l-Asma. The \"Order,\" whose foundation the Promised  One was to establish in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and the features of which the  Center of the Covenant was to delineate in His Testament, and whose  administrative framework the entire body of His followers are now  erecting, had been categorically announced in the Persian Bayan. The laws  which were designed, on the one hand, to abolish at a stroke the  privileges and ceremonials, the ordinances and institutions of a  superannuated Dispensation, and to bridge, on the other, the gap between  an obsolete system and the institutions of a world-encompassing Order  destined to supersede it, had been clearly formulated and proclaimed. The  Covenant which, despite the determined assaults launched against it,  succeeded, unlike all previous Dispensations, in preserving the integrity  of the Faith of its Author, and in paving the way for the advent of the  One Who was to be its Center and Object, had been firmly and irrevocably  established. The light which, throughout successive periods, was to  propagate itself gradually from its cradle as far as Vancouver in the West  and the China Sea in the East, and to diffuse its radiance as far as  Iceland in the North and the Tasman Sea in the South, had broken. The  forces of darkness, at first confined to the concerted hostility of the  civil and ecclesiastical powers of _Sh_i'ah Persia, gathering momentum, at  a later stage, through the avowed and persistent opposition of the Caliph  of Islam and the Sunni hierarchy in Turkey, and destined to culminate in  the fierce antagonism of the sacerdotal orders associated with other and  still more powerful religious systems, had launched their initial assault.  The nucleus of the divinely ordained, world-embracing Community--a  Community whose infant strength had already plucked asunder the fetters of  _Sh_i'ah orthodoxy, and which was, with every expansion in the range of  its fellowship, to seek and obtain a wider and still more significant  recognition of its claims to be the world religion of the future, had been  formed and was slowly crystallizing. And, lastly, the seed, endowed by the  Hand of Omnipotence with such vast potentialities, though rudely trampled  under foot and seemingly perished from the face of the earth, had, through  this very process, been vouchsafed the opportunity to germinate and  remanifest itself, in the shape of a still more compelling Revelation--a  Revelation destined to blossom forth, in a later period into the  flourishing institutions of a world-wide administrative System, and to  ripen, in the Golden Age as yet unborn, into mighty agencies functioning  in consonance with the principles of a world-unifying, world-redeeming  Order.          Chapter V: The Attempt on the Life of the Shah and Its Consequences      The Faith that had stirred a whole nation to its depth, for whose sake  thousands of precious and heroic souls had been immolated and on whose  altar He Who had been its Author had sacrificed His life, was now being  subjected to the strain and stress of yet another crisis of extreme  violence and far-reaching consequences. It was one of those periodic  crises which, occurring throughout a whole century, succeeded in  momentarily eclipsing the splendor of the Faith and in almost disrupting  the structure of its organic institutions. Invariably sudden, often  unexpected, seemingly fatal to both its spirit and its life, these  inevitable manifestations of the mysterious evolution of a world Religion,  intensely alive, challenging in its claims, revolutionizing in its tenets,  struggling against overwhelming odds, have either been externally  precipitated by the malice of its avowed antagonists or internally  provoked by the unwisdom of its friends, the apostasy of its supporters,  or the defection of some of the most highly placed amongst the kith and  kin of its founders. No matter how disconcerting to the great mass of its  loyal adherents, however much trumpeted by its adversaries as symptoms of  its decline and impending dissolution, these admitted setbacks and  reverses, from which it has time and again so tragically suffered, have,  as we look back upon them, failed to arrest its march or impair its unity.  Heavy indeed has been the toll which they exacted, unspeakable the agonies  they engendered, widespread and paralyzing for a time the consternation  they provoked. Yet, viewed in their proper perspective, each of them can  be confidently pronounced a blessing in disguise, affording a providential  means for the release of a fresh outpouring of celestial strength, a  miraculous escape from imminent and still more dreadful calamities, an  instrument for the fulfillment of age-old prophecies, an agency for the  purification and revitalization of the life of the community, an impetus  for the enlargement of its limits and the propagation of its influence,  and a compelling evidence of the indestructibility of its cohesive  strength. Sometimes at the height of the crisis itself, more often when  the crisis was past, the significance of these trials has manifested  itself to men's eyes, and the necessity of such experiences has been  demonstrated, far and wide and beyond the shadow of a doubt, to both  friend and foe. Seldom, if indeed at any time, has the mystery underlying  these portentous, God-sent upheavals remained undisclosed, or the profound  purpose and meaning of their occurrence been left hidden from the minds of  men.    Such a severe ordeal the Faith of the Bab, still in the earliest stages of  its infancy, was now beginning to experience. Maligned and hounded from  the moment it was born, deprived in its earliest days of the sustaining  strength of the majority of its leading supporters, stunned by the tragic  and sudden removal of its Founder, reeling under the cruel blows it had  successively sustained in Mazindaran, Tihran, Nayriz and Zanjan, a sorely  persecuted Faith was about to be subjected through the shameful act of a  fanatical and irresponsible Babi, to a humiliation such as it had never  before known. To the trials it had undergone was now added the oppressive  load of a fresh calamity, unprecedented in its gravity, disgraceful in its  character, and devastating in its immediate consequences.    Obsessed by the bitter tragedy of the martyrdom of his beloved Master,  driven by a frenzy of despair to avenge that odious deed, and believing  the author and instigator of that crime to be none other than the _Sh_ah  himself, a certain Sadiq-i-Tabrizi, an assistant in a confectioner's shop  in Tihran, proceeded on an August day (August 15, 1852), together with his  accomplice, an equally obscure youth named Fathu'llah-i-Qumi, to Niyavaran  where the imperial army had encamped and the sovereign was in residence,  and there, waiting by the roadside, in the guise of an innocent bystander,  fired a round of shot from his pistol at the _Sh_ah, shortly after the  latter had emerged on horseback from the palace grounds for his morning  promenade. The weapon the assailant employed demonstrated beyond the  shadow of a doubt the folly of that half-demented youth, and clearly  indicated that no man of sound judgment could have possibly instigated so  senseless an act.    The whole of Niyavaran where the imperial court and troops had congregated  was, as a result of this assault, plunged into an unimaginable tumult. The  ministers of the state, headed by Mirza Aqa _Kh_an-i-Nuri, the  I'timadu'd-Dawlih, the successor of the Amir-Nizam, rushed horror-stricken  to the side of their wounded sovereign. The fanfare of the trumpets, the  rolling of the drums and the shrill piping of the fifes summoned the hosts  of His Imperial Majesty on all sides. The _Sh_ah's attendants, some on  horseback, others on foot, poured into the palace grounds. Pandemonium  reigned in which every one issued orders, none listened, none obeyed, nor  understood anything. Ardi_sh_ir Mirza, the governor of Tihran, having in  the meantime already ordered his troops to patrol the deserted streets of  the capital, barred the gates of the citadel as well as of the city,  charged his batteries and feverishly dispatched a messenger to ascertain  the veracity of the wild rumors that were circulating amongst the  populace, and to ask for special instructions.    No sooner had this act been perpetrated than its shadow fell across the  entire body of the Babi community. A storm of public horror, disgust and  resentment, heightened by the implacable hostility of the mother of the  youthful sovereign, swept the nation, casting aside all possibility of  even the most elementary inquiry into the origins and the instigators of  the attempt. A sign, a whisper, was sufficient to implicate the innocent  and loose upon him the most abominable afflictions. An army of  foes--ecclesiastics, state officials and people, united in relentless hate,  and watching for an opportunity to discredit and annihilate a dreaded  adversary--had, at long last, been afforded the pretext for which it was  longing. Now it could achieve its malevolent purpose. Though the Faith  had, from its inception, disclaimed any intention of usurping the rights  and prerogatives of the state; though its exponents and disciples had  sedulously avoided any act that might arouse the slightest suspicion of a  desire to wage a holy war, or to evince an aggressive attitude, yet its  enemies, deliberately ignoring the numerous evidences of the marked  restraint exercised"]]]
