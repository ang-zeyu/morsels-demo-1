Cuvier and Geoffroy are the greatest representatives of these opposing  views. Which of them is right? Is there nothing more in the unity and  diversity of organic forms than the results of functional adaptation, or  is Geoffroy right in insisting upon an element of unity which cannot be  explained in terms of adaptation? If there be an irreducible element of  unity, is there any truth in Geoffroy's suggestion that this unity  results from a power which is exercised in the world of atoms where are  elements of inalterable character?[129]    The problem as Geoffroy and Cuvier understood it was not an evolutionary  one. But the problem exists unchanged for the evolutionist, and  evolution-theory is essentially an attempt to solve it in the one  direction or the other. Theories such as Darwin's, which assume a random  variation which is not primarily a response to environmental changes,  answer the problem in Geoffroy's sense. Theories such as Lamarck's,  which postulate an active responsive self-adaptation of the organism,  are essentially a continuation and completing of Cuvier's thought.

CHAPTER VI    THE FOLLOWERS OF ETIENNE GEOFFROY SAINT-HILAIRE      Geoffroy's theories were not generally accepted by his contemporaries,  but his methods had considerable influence, especially in France, where  many made essays in pure morphology.    His chief follower was Serres, who is mentioned indeed in the  _Philosophie anatomique_ as a fellow-worker. Serres was primarily a  medical anatomist; his interest lay in human anatomy and embryology,  normal and pathological.    His best early work was an _Anatomie comparee du cerveau_ (1824-26),  which met with a flattering reception from Cuvier.[130] He laid great  stress upon the development of the brain and spinal cord in the  different classes, and was quick to point out analogies not only between  adult but also between embryonic structures. He paid much attention to  cases of correlation, and noted a great many; he observed, for instance,  a constant relation between the development of the spinal cord and of  the corpora quadrigemina, and between the size of the corpora  quadrigemina and the volume of the optic nerves and eyes. In this the  influence of Cuvier is unmistakable.    Serres' early theoretical views are to be found in a series of papers in  the _Annales des Sciences naturelles_,[131] under the general title  _Recherches d'Anatomie transcendante, sur les Lois de l'Organogenie  appliquees a l'anatomie pathologique_, also published separately. We  follow these papers in our expose of Serres' doctrine, reserving for a  future chapter (Chap. XII.) the consideration of his matured views of  thirty years later.    In the first of them he points out how neither position nor function has  proved altogether sufficient to establish homologies. In the early days  anatomists were guided by form; when form failed them, they traced an  organ in its changes throughout the series of animals by considering its  function. This method was satisfactory enough as regards the organs of  the nutritive life. But in the organs of the life of relation, in the  nervous system, the functions of the parts were difficult to discover,  and their form very changeful. Hence a new principle was required, and  Serres found it in the thought which he probably owed to the German  transcendentalists (see Chap. VII.), that the permanent structure of the  lower animals could be compared with phases in the development of the  higher, and particularly of man, or, as he put it, that comparative  anatomy was often only a fixed and permanent anthropogeny, and  anthropogeny a fugitive and transitory comparative anatomy (xi., p.  106).    \"In rising towards the first formations,\" he writes, \"transcendental  anatomy recognised that one and the same organ, however complicated its  definitive form might be, repeated in its transitory states the organic  simplicities of the lower classes. Thus the primitive heart of birds was  first of all a canal, then a pocket or single cavity, then finally the  complex organ of the class. Comparative anatomy was thus seen to be  repeated and reproduced by embryogeny\" (xii., p. 85).    His explanation of the fact of repetition is that, \"in animals belonging  to the lower classes the _formative force_, whatever it may be, has a  less energetic impulsion than in the higher animals, and hence the  organs pass through only a part of the transformations which those of  the higher forms undergo; and it is for this reason that they show  permanently the organic dispositions which are only transitory in the  embryo of man and the higher Vertebrates. Hence these double aortas,  these double venae cavae which one observes more or less constantly among  reptiles\" (xxi., p. 48).    The number of stages in embryogeny is proportionate to the complexity of  the adult; the younger the embryo the simpler its organs--such is the  general formula of the relation between the embryo and the adult. But  here in Serres' doctrine of parallelism a complication enters. He  observed that embryonic organs did not always develop in a piece, by  simple growth, but often were formed by the union of separately formed  parts or layers. Thus the kidney in man is formed by the fusion of a  number of \"little kidneys,\" and the spinal cord reaches its full  development by the laying down of successive layers within it. He was  greatly impressed with this fact, which, as a convinced believer in  epigenesis, he used with great effect against the preformistic theories.  \"This method of isolated formation,\" he wrote, \"is noticed in early  stages in the thyroid, the liver, the heart, the aorta, the intestinal  canal, the womb, the prostate, the clitoris, and the penis\" (xi., p.  69). So, too, in the development of the skeleton, ossification proceeds  from separate centres, foramina are formed by the fusion of separate  bones round them. In his memoir, _Lois d'Osteogenie_ (1819), Serres  established several laws of ossification based upon this principle of  separate formation.[132]    How is the fact of multiple formation to be reconciled with the  principle of repetition, according to which organs are simplest in the  early embryo and in the lower animals? But observation shows that, as a  rule, the further down the scale you go the more divided organs  become--the more numerous the bones of the skull, for example. There is  thus a parallel between multiple formation of organs in the embryos of  the higher Vertebrates and their subdivided state in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#18)"],[1,"of  clergymen who thought they were speaking for God. Usually Ernestine  Rose was on hand, ready to speak when needed, injecting into the  discussions her liberal clear-cut feminist views. Nor was the  international aspect of the woman's rights movement forgotten. The  interest in Great Britain in the franchise for women of such men as  Lord Brougham and John Stuart Mill was reported as were the efforts  there among women to gain admission to the medical profession.  Distributed widely as a tract was the \"admirable\" article in the  _Westminster Review_, \"The Enfranchisement of Women,\" by Harriet  Taylor, now Mrs. John Stuart Mill.    In New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, where  state conventions were held annually, women carried back to their  homes and their friends new and stimulating ideas. National  conventions, which actually represented merely the northeastern states  and Ohio and occasionally attracted men and women from Indiana,  Missouri, and Kansas, were scheduled by Susan to meet every year in  New York, simultaneously with antislavery conventions. Thus she was  assured of a brilliant array of speakers, for the Garrisonian  abolitionists were sincere advocates of woman's rights.    Both Elizabeth Stanton and Lucy Stone were a great help to Susan in  preparing for these national gatherings for which she raised the  money. Elizabeth wrote the calls and resolutions, while Lucy could not  only be counted upon for an eloquent speech, but through her wide  contacts brought new speakers and new converts to the meetings.  However, national woman's rights conventions would probably have  lapsed completely during the troubled years prior to the Civil War,  had it not been for Susan's persistence. She was obliged to omit the  1857 convention because all of her best speakers were either having  babies or were kept at home by family duties. Lucy's baby, Alice Stone  Blackwell, was born in September 1857, then Antoinette Brown's first  child, and Mrs. Stanton's seventh.    [Illustration: Lucy Stone and her daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell]    Impatient to get on with the work, Susan chafed at the delay and when  Lucy wrote her, \"I shall not assume the responsibility for another  convention until I have had my ten daughters,\"[99] Susan was beside  herself with apprehension. When Lucy told her that it was harder to  take care of a baby day and night than to campaign for woman's rights,  she felt that Lucy regarded as unimportant her \"common work\" of hiring  halls, engaging speakers, and raising money. This rankled, for  although Susan realized it was work without glory, she did expect Lucy  to understand its significance.    Mrs. Stanton sensed the makings of a rift between Susan and these  young mothers, Lucy and Antoinette, and knowing from her own  experience how torn a woman could be between rearing a family and work  for the cause, she pleaded with Susan to be patient with them. \"Let  them rest a while in peace and quietness, and think great thoughts for  the future,\" she wrote Susan. \"It is not well to be in the excitement  of public life all the time. Do not keep stirring them up or mourning  over their repose. You need rest too. Let the world alone a while. We  cannot bring about a moral revolution in a day or a year.\"[100]    But Susan could not let the world alone. There was too much to be  done. In addition to her woman's rights and antislavery work, she gave  a helping hand to any good cause in Rochester, such as a protest  meeting against capital punishment, a series of Sunday evening  lectures, or establishing a Free Church like that headed by Theodore  Parker in Boston where no one doctrine would be preached and all would  be welcome. There were days when weariness and discouragement hung  heavily upon her. Then impatient that she alone seemed to be carrying  the burden of the whole woman's rights movement, she complained to  Lydia Mott, \"There is not one woman left who may be relied on. All  have first to please their husbands after which there is little time  or energy left to spend in any other direction.... How soon the last  standing monuments (yourself and myself, Lydia) will lay down the  individual 'shovel and de hoe' and with proper zeal and spirit grasp  those of some masculine hand, the mercies and the spirits only know. I  declare to you that I distrust the powers of any woman, even of myself  to withstand the mighty matrimonial maelstrom!\"[101]    To Elizabeth Stanton she confessed, \"I have very weak moments and long  to lay my weary head somewhere and nestle my full soul to that of  another in full sympathy. I sometimes fear that _I too_ shall faint by  the wayside and drop out of the ranks of the faithful few.\"[102]           *       *       *       *       *    Susan thought a great deal about marriage at this time, about how it  interfered with the development of women's talents and their careers,  how it usually dwarfed their individuality. Nor were these thoughts  wholly impersonal, for she had attentive suitors during these years.  Her diary mentions moonlight rides and adds, \"Mr.--walked home with  me; marvelously attentive. What a pity such powers of intellect should  lack the moral spine.\"[103] Her standards of matrimony were high, and  she carefully recorded in her diary Lucretia Mott's wise words, \"In  the true marriage relation, the independence of the husband and wife  is equal, their dependence mutual, and their obligations  reciprocal.\"[104]    Marriage and the differences of the sexes were often discussed at the  many meetings she attended, and when remarks were made which to her  seemed to limit in any way the free and full development of woman, she  always registered her protest. She had no patience with any  unrealistic glossing over of sex attraction and spurned the theory  that woman expressed love and man wisdom, that these two qualities  reached out for each other and blended in marriage. Because she spoke  frankly for those days and did not soften the impact of her words with  sentimental flowery phrases, her remarks were sometimes called  \"coarse\" and \"animal,\" but she justified them in a letter to Mrs.  Stanton, who thought as she did, \"To me it [sex] is not coarse or  gross. If it is a fact, there it is.\"[105]    She was reading at this time Elizabeth Barrett Browning's _Aurora  Leigh_, called by Ruskin the greatest poem in the English language,  but criticized by others as an indecent romance revolting to the  purity of many women. Susan had bought a copy of the first American  edition and she carried it with her wherever she went. After a hard  active day, she found inspiration and refreshment in its pages. No  matter how dreary the hotel room or how unfriendly the town, she no  longer felt lonely or discouraged, for Aurora Leigh was a companion  ever at hand, giving her confidence in herself, strengthening her  ambition, and helping her build a satisfying, constructive philosophy  of life. On the flyleaf of her worn copy, which in later years she  presented to the Library of Congress, she wrote, \"This book was  carried in my satchel for years and read and reread. The noble words  of Elizabeth Barrett, as Wendell Phillips always called her, sunk deep  into my heart. I have always cherished it above all other books. I now  present it to the Congressional Library with the hope that women may  more and more be like Aurora Leigh.\"    The beauty of its poetry enchanted her, and Elizabeth Barrett  Browning's feminism found an echo in her own. She pencil-marked the  passages she wanted to reread. When her \"common work\" of hiring halls  and engaging speakers seemed unimportant and even futile, she found  comfort in these lines:        \"Be sure no earnest work      Of any honest creature, howbeit weak      Imperfect, ill-adapted, fails so much,      It is not gathered as a grain of sand      To enlarge the sum of human action used      For carrying out God's end....      ... let us be content in work,      To do the thing we can, and not presume      To fret because it's little.\"[106]    Glorying in work, she read with satisfaction:        \"The honest earnest man must stand and work:      The woman also, otherwise she drops      At once below the dignity of man,      Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work;      Who ever fears God, fears to sit at ease.\"    Could she have written poetry, these words, spoken by Aurora, might  well have been her own:        \"You misconceive the question like a man,      Who sees a woman as the complement      Of his sex merely. You forget too much      That every creature, female as the male,      Stands single in responsible act and thought,      As also in birth and death. Whoever says      To a loyal woman, 'Love and work with me,'      Will get fair answers, if the work and love      Being good of themselves, are good for her--the best      She was born for.\"    Inspired by _Aurora Leigh_, Susan planned a new lecture, \"The True  Woman,\" and as she wrote it out word for word, her thoughts and  theories about women, which had been developing through the years,  crystallized. In her opinion, the \"true woman\" could no more than  Aurora Leigh follow the traditional course and sacrifice all for the  love of one man, adjusting her life to his whims. She must, instead,  develop her own personality and talents, advancing in learning, in the  arts, in science, and in business, cherishing at the same time her  noble womanly qualities. Susan hoped that some day the full  development of woman's individuality would be compatible with  marriage, and she held up as an ideal the words which Elizabeth  Barrett Browning put into the mouth of Aurora Leigh:            \"The world waits      For help. Beloved, let us work so well,      Our work shall still be better for our love      And still our love be sweeter for our work      And both, commended, for the sake of each,      By all true workers and true lovers born.\""]]]
