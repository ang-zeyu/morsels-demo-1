The  _savants_, after all, should never speculate on my bones.    I saw the ruddy disk of Mars, and the glinting of his icy poles, as the  beautiful planet rolled far below me. \"If I could only get there,\" I  thought, \"I should know what those canals of Schiaparelli are, and even  if I could never return to the earth, I should doubtless meet with a  warm welcome among the Martians. What a lion I should be!\" I looked  longingly at the distant planet, the outlines of whose continents and  seas appeared most enticing, but when I tried to propel myself in that  direction I only kicked against nothingness. I groaned in desperation.    Suddenly something darted by me flying sunward; then another and  another. In a minute I was surrounded by strange projectiles. Every  instant I expected to be dashed in pieces by them. They sped with the  velocity of lightning. Hundreds, thousands of them were all about me. My  chance of not being hit was not one in a million, and yet I escaped. The  sweat of terror was upon me, but I did not lose my head. \"A comet has  met me,\" I said. \"These missiles are the meteoric stones of which it is  composed.\" And now I noticed that as they rushed along collisions took  place, and flashes of electricity darted from one to another. A pale  luminosity dimmed the stars. I did not doubt that, as seen from the  earth, the comet was already flinging the splendors of its train upon  the bosom of the night.    While I was wondering at my immunity amid such a rain of  death-threatening bolts, I became aware that their velocity was sensibly  diminishing. This fact I explained by supposing that I was drawn along  with them. Notwithstanding the absence of any collision with my body,  the overpowering attraction of the whole mass of meteors was overcoming  my tangential force and bearing me in their direction. At first I  rejoiced at this circumstance, for at any rate the comet would save me  from the dreadful fate of becoming an asteroid. A little further  reflection, however, showed me that I had gone from the frying-pan into  the fire. The direction of my expulsion from Menippe had been such that  I had fallen into an orbit that would have carried me around the sun  without passing very close to the solar body. Now, being swept along by  the comet, whose perihelion probably lay in the immediate neighborhood  of the sun, I saw no way of escape from the frightful fate of being  broiled alive. Even where I was, the untempered rays of the sun scorched  me, and I knew that within two or three hundred thousand miles of the  solar surface the heat must be sufficient to melt the hardest rocks. I  was aware that experiments with burning-glasses had sufficiently  demonstrated that fact.    But perforce I resigned myself to my fate. At any rate it would the  sooner be all over. In fact, I almost forgot my awful situation in the  interest awakened by the phenomena of the comet. I was in the midst of  its very head. I was one of its component particles. I was a meteor  among a million millions of others. If I could only get back to the  earth, what news could I not carry to Signor Schiaparelli and Mr.  Lockyer and Dr. Bredichin about the composition of comets! But, alas!  the world could never know what I now saw. Nobody on yonder gleaming  earth, watching the magnificent advance of this \"specter of the skies,\"  would ever dream that there was a lost astronomer in its blazing head. I  should be burned and rent to pieces amid the terrors of its perihelion  passage, and my fragments would be strewn along the comet's orbit, to  become, in course of time, particles in a swarm of aerolites. Perchance,  through the effects of some unforeseen perturbation, the earth might  encounter that swarm. Thus only could I ever return to the bosom of my  mother planet. I took a positive pleasure in imagining that one of my  calcined bones might eventually flash for a moment, a falling star, in  the atmosphere of the earth, leaving its atoms to slowly settle through  the air, until finally they rested in the soil from which they had  sprung.    From such reflections I was aroused by the approach of the crisis. The  head of the comet had become an exceedingly uncomfortable place. The  collisions among the meteors were constantly increasing in number and  violence. How I escaped destruction I could not comprehend, but in fact  I was unconscious of danger from that source. I had become in spirit an  actual component of the clashing, roaring mass. Tremendous sparks of  electricity, veritable lightning strokes, darted about me in every  direction, but I bore a charmed life. As the comet drew in nearer to  the sun, under the terrible stress of the solar attraction, the meteors  seemed to crowd closer, crashing and grinding together, while the whole  mass swayed and shrieked with the uproar of a million tormented devils.  The heat had become terrific. I saw stone and iron melted like snow and  dissipated in steam. Stupendous jets of white-hot vapor shot upward,  and, driven off by the electrical repulsion of the sun, streamed  backward into the tail.    Suddenly I myself became sensible of the awful heat. It seemed without  warning to have penetrated my vitals. With a yell I jerked my feet from  a boiling rock and flung my arms despairingly over my head.    \"You had better be careful,\" said my wife, \"or you'll knock over the  telescope.\"    I rubbed my eyes, shook myself, and rose.    \"I must have been dreaming,\" I said.    \"I should think it was a very lively dream,\" she replied.    I responded after the manner of a young man newly wed.    At this moment the occultation began.          CHAPTER VI    JUPITER, THE GREATEST OF KNOWN WORLDS      When we are thinking of worlds, and trying to exalt the imagination with  them, it is well to turn to Jupiter, for there is a planet worth  pondering upon! A world thirteen hundred times as voluminous as the  earth is a phenomenon calculated to make us feel somewhat as the  inhabitant of a rural village does when his amazed vision ranges across  the million roofs of a metropolis. Jupiter is the first of the outer and  greater planets, the major, or Jovian, group. His mean diameter is  86,500 miles, and his average girth more than 270,000 miles. An  inhabitant of Jupiter, in making a trip around his planet, along any  great circle of the sphere, would have to travel more than 30,000 miles  farther than the distance between the earth and the moon. The polar  compression of Jupiter, owing to his rapid rotation, amounts in the  aggregate to more than 5,000 miles, the equatorial diameter being 88,200  miles and the polar diameter 83,000 miles.    Jupiter's mean distance from the sun is 483,000,000 miles, and the  eccentricity of his orbit is sufficient to make this distance variable  to the extent of 21,000,000 miles; but, in view of his great average  distance, the consequent variation in the amount of solar light and heat  received by the planet is not of serious importance.    When he is in opposition to the sun as seen from the earth Jupiter's  mean distance from us is about 390,000,000 miles. His year, or period of  revolution about the sun, is somewhat less than twelve of our years  (11.86 years). His axis is very nearly upright to the plane of his  orbit, so that, as upon Venus, there is practically no variation of  seasons. Gigantic though he is in dimensions, Jupiter is the swiftest of  all the planets in axial rotation. While the earth requires twenty-four  hours to make a complete turn, Jupiter takes less than ten hours (nine  hours fifty-five minutes), and a point on his equator moves, in  consequence of axial rotation, between 27,000 and 28,000 miles in an  hour.    The density of the mighty planet is slight, only about one quarter of  the mean density of the earth and virtually the same as that of the sun.  This fact at once calls attention to a contrast between Jupiter and our  globe that is even more significant than their immense difference in  size. The force of gravity upon Jupiter's surface is more than two and a  half times greater than upon the earth's surface (more accurately 2.65  times), so that a hundred-pound weight removed from the planet on which  we live to Jupiter would there weigh 265 pounds, and an average man,  similarly transported, would be oppressed with a weight of at least 400  pounds. But, as a result of the rapid rotation of the great planet, and  the ellipticity of its figure, the unfortunate visitor could find a  perceptible relief from his troublesome weight by seeking the planet's  equator, where the centrifugal tendency would remove about twenty pounds  from every one hundred as compared with his weight at the poles.    If we could go to the moon, or to Mercury, Venus, or Mars, we may be  certain that upon reaching any of those globes we should find ourselves  upon a solid surface, probably composed of rock not unlike the rocky  crust of the earth; but with Jupiter the case would evidently be very  different. As already remarked, the mean density of that planet is only  one quarter of the earth's density, or only one third greater than the  density of water. Consequently the visitor, in attempting to set foot  upon Jupiter, might find no solid supporting surface, but would be in a  situation as embarrassing as that of Milton's Satan when he undertook to  cross the domain of Chaos:        \"Fluttering his pinions vain, plumb down he drops,      Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour      Down had been falling had not, by ill chance,      The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud.      Instinct with fire and niter, hurried him      As many miles aloft; that fury stayed,      Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea      Nor good dry land, nigh foundered, as he fares,      Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,      Half flying.\"    The probability that nothing resembling a solid crust, nor, perhaps,  "]]]
