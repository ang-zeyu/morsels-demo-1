We'll pray every day, grandfather, won't we, for  otherwise God might forget us.\"    \"And if somebody should forget to do it?\" murmured the old man.    \"Oh, he'll get on badly, for God will forget him, too. If he is  unhappy and wretched, people don't pity him, for they will say: 'he  went away from God, and now the Lord, who alone can help him, has no  pity on him'.\"    \"Is that true, Heidi? Who told you so?\"    \"Grandmama explained it all to me.\"    After a pause the grandfather said: \"Yes, but if it has happened, then  there is no help; nobody can come back to the Lord, when God has once  forgotten him.\"    \"But grandfather, everybody can come back to Him; grandmama told me  that, and besides there is the beautiful story in my book. Oh,  grandfather, you don't know it yet, and I shall read it to you as soon  as we get home.\"    The grandfather had brought a big basket with him, in which he carried  half the contents of Heidi's trunk; it had been too large to be  conveyed up the steep ascent. Arriving at the hut and setting down his  load, he had to sit beside Heidi, who was ready to begin the tale.  With great animation Heidi read the story of the prodigal son, who  was happy at home with his father's cows and sheep. The picture showed  him leaning on his staff, watching the sunset. \"Suddenly he wanted to  have his own inheritance, and be able to be his own master. Demanding  the money from his father, he went away and squandered all. When he  had nothing in the world left, he had to go as servant to a peasant,  who did not own fine cattle like his father, but only swine; his  clothes were rags, and for food he only got the husks on which the  pigs were fed. Often he would think what a good home he had left, and  when he remembered how good his father had been to him and his own  ungratefulness, he would cry from repentance and longing. Then he said  to himself: 'I shall go to my father and ask his forgiveness.' When he  approached his former home, his father came out to meet him--\"    \"What do you think will happen now?\" Heidi asked. \"You think that the  father is angry and will say: 'Didn't I tell you?' But just listen:  'And his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his  neck. And the son said: Father, I have sinned against Heaven and in  Thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called Thy son. But the father  said to his servants: Bring forth the best robe and put it on him; and  put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet; and bring hither the  fatted calf and kill it; and let us eat and be merry: For this my son  was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they  began to be merry.\"    \"Isn't it a beautiful story, grandfather?\" asked Heidi, when he sat  silently beside her.    \"Yes, Heidi, it is,\" said the grandfather, but so seriously that Heidi  quietly looked at the pictures. \"Look how happy he is,\" she said,  pointing to it.    A few hours later, when Heidi was sleeping soundly, the old man  climbed up the ladder. Placing a little lamp beside the sleeping  child, he watched her a long, long time. Her little hands were folded  and her rosy face looked confident and peaceful. The old man now  folded his hands and said in a low voice, while big tears rolled down  his cheeks: \"Father, I have sinned against Heaven and Thee, and am no  more worthy to be Thy son!\"    The next morning found the uncle standing before the door, looking  about him over valley and mountain. A few early bells sounded from  below and the birds sang their morning anthems.    Re-entering the house, he called: \"Heidi, get up! The sun is shining!  Put on a pretty dress, for we are going to church!\"    That was a new call, and Heidi obeyed quickly. When the child came  downstairs in her smart little frock, she opened her eyes wide. \"Oh,  grandfather!\" she exclaimed, \"I have never seen you in your Sunday  coat with the silver buttons. Oh, how fine you look!\"    The old man, turning to the child, said with a smile: \"You look nice,  too; come now!\" With Heidi's hand in his they wandered down together.  The nearer they came to the village, the louder and richer the bells  resounded. \"Oh grandfather, do you hear it? It seems like a big, high  feast,\" said Heidi.    When they entered the church, all the people were singing. Though they  sat down on the last bench behind, the people had noticed their  presence and whispered it from ear to ear. When the pastor began to  preach, his words were a loud thanksgiving that moved all his hearers.  After the service the old man and the child walked to the parsonage.  The clergyman had opened the door and received them with friendly  words. \"I have come to ask your forgiveness for my harsh words,\" said  the uncle. \"I want to follow your advice to spend the winter here  among you. If the people look at me askance, I can't expect any  better. I am sure, Mr. Pastor, you will not do so.\"       [Illustration: WITH HEIDI'S HAND IN HIS THEY WANDERED DOWN     TOGETHER]    The pastor's friendly eyes sparkled, and with many a kind word he  commended the uncle for this change, and putting his hand on Heidi's  curly hair, ushered them out. Thus the people, who had been all  talking together about this great event, could see that their  clergyman shook hands with the old man. The door of the parsonage was  hardly shut, when the whole assembly came forward with outstretched  hands and friendly greetings. Great seemed to be their joy at the old  man's resolution; some of the people even accompanied him on his  homeward way. When they had parted at last, the uncle looked after  them with his face shining as with an inward light. Heidi looked up to  him and said: \"Grandfather, you have never looked so beautiful!\"    \"Do you think so, child?\" he said with a smile. \"You see, Heidi, I am  more happy than I deserve; to be at peace with God and men makes one's  heart feel light. God has been good to me, to send you back.\"    When they arrived at Peter's hut, the grandfather opened the door and  entered. \"How do you do, grandmother,\" he called out. \"I think we  must start to mend again, before the fall wind comes.\"    \"Oh my God, the uncle!\" exclaimed the grandmother in joyous surprise.  \"How happy I am to be able to thank you for what you have done, uncle!  Thank you, God bless you for it.\"    With trembling joy the grandmother shook hands with her old friend.  \"There is something else I want to say to you, uncle,\" she continued.  \"If I have ever hurt you in any way, do not punish me. Do not let  Heidi go away again before I die. I cannot tell you what Heidi means  to me!\" So saying, she held the clinging child to her.    \"No danger of that, grandmother, I hope we shall all stay together now  for many years to come.\"    Brigida now showed Heidi's feather hat to the old man and asked him to  take it back. But the uncle asked her to keep it, since Heidi had  given it to her.    \"What blessings this child has brought from Frankfurt,\" Brigida said.  \"I often wondered if I should not send our little Peter too. What do  you think, uncle?\"    The uncle's eyes sparkled with fun, when he replied: \"I am sure it  would not hurt Peter; nevertheless I should wait for a fitting  occasion before I sent him.\"    The next moment Peter himself arrived in great haste. He had a letter  for Heidi, which had been given to him in the village. What an event,  a letter for Heidi! They all sat down at the table while the child  read it aloud. The letter was from Clara Sesemann, who wrote that  everything had got so dull since Heidi left. She said that she could  not stand it very long, and therefore her father had promised to take  her to Ragatz this coming fall. She announced that Grandmama was  coming too, for she wanted to see Heidi and her grandfather.  Grandmama, having heard about the rolls, was sending some coffee, too,  so that the grandmother would not have to eat them dry. Grandmama  also insisted on being taken to the grandmother herself when she came  on her visit.    Great was the delight caused by this news, and what with all the  questions and plans that followed, the grandfather himself forgot how  late it was. This happy day, which had united them all, caused the old  woman to say at parting: \"The most beautiful thing of all, though, is  to be able to shake hands again with an old friend, as in days gone  by; it is a great comfort to find again, what we have treasured. I  hope you'll come soon again, uncle. I am counting on the child for  tomorrow.\"    This promise was given. While Heidi and her grandfather were on their  homeward path, the peaceful sound of evening bells accompanied them.  At last they reached the cottage, which seemed to glow in the evening  light.          Part II    Heidi Makes Use of Her Experience      [Illustration]          XV    PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY      The kind doctor who had sent Heidi home to her beloved mountains was  approaching the Sesemann residence on a sunny day in September.  Everything about him was bright and cheerful, but the doctor did not  even raise his eyes from the pavement to the blue sky above. His face  was sad and his hair had turned very gray since spring. A few months  ago the doctor had lost his only daughter, who had lived with him  since his wife's early death. The blooming girl had been his only joy,  and since she had gone from him the ever-cheerful doctor was bowed  down with grief.    When Sebastian opened the door to the physician he bowed very low, for  the doctor made friends wherever he went.    \"I am glad you have come doctor,\" Mr. Sesemann called to his friend as  he entered. \"Please let us talk over this trip to Switzerland again.  Do you still give the same advice, now that Clara is so much better?\"    \"What must I think of you, Sesemann?\" replied the doctor, sitting  down. \"I wish your mother was here.

Ned knowed all de time dat he had killed  it and had it hid in his loft. He hunted and called \"Pig-ooie, Pig.\"  Somebody done stole old Master's big blue hog. Dey couldn't find it  but old Master thought Ned knowed something 'bout it. One night he  found out Ned was gonna kill another hog and had asked John to go with  him. He borrowed John's clothes and blacked his face and met Ned at de  river. Soon dey find a nice big one and Ned say, \"John, I'll drive him  round and you kill him.\" So he drove him past old Master but he didn't  want to kill his own hog so he made lak he'd like to kill him but he  missed him. Finally Ned got tired and said. \"I'll kill him, you drive  him by me.\" So Master John drove him by him and Ned knock de hog on de  head and cut his throat and dey load him on de canoe. When dey was  nearly 'cross de river Old Master dip up some water and wash his face  a little, then he look at Ned and he say, \"Ned you look sick, I  believe you've got lepersy.\" Ned row on little more and he jump in de  river and Master had a hard time finding him again. He had the  overseer whip Ned for that.    I think Lincoln was a wonderful man. Everybody was sorry when he died,  but I never heerd of Jeff Davis.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    10-19-38  1,876-words    DELLA FOUNTAIN  Age 69 years  McAlester, Oklahoma      I was born after de War of de Rebellion but I 'member lots o' things  dat my parents told me 'bout slavery.    My grandmother was captured in Africa. Traders come dere in a big boat  and dey had all sorts of purty gew-gaws--red handkerchiefs, dress  goods, beads, bells, and trinkets in bright colors. Dey would pull up  at de shore and entice de colored folks onto de boat to see de purty  things. Befo' de darkies realized it dey would be out from shore.  Dat's de way she was captured. Fifteen to twenty-five would pay dem  for de trip as dey all brought good prices.    I was born and raised in Louisiana, near Winfield. My mother's Master  was John Rogers and his wife was Miss Millie. Dey was awful good to  deir slaves and he never whupped his grown niggers.    I 'member when I was a child dat we didn't have hardly anything to  keep house wid, but we got along purty well I guess. Our furniture was  home-made and we cooked on de fireplace.    We saved all our oak-wood ashes, and would put a barrel on a slanting  scaffold and put sticks and shucks in de bottom of de barrel and den  fill it wid de ashes. We'd pour water in it and let it drip. Dese  drippings made pure lye. We used dis wid cracklings and meat scraps to  make our soap.    Father took a good-sized pine long and split it open, planed it down  smooth and bored holes in de bottom and drove pegs in dem for legs;  dis was our battling bench. We'd spread our wet clothes on dis and  rub soap on 'em and take a paddle and beat de dirt out. We got 'em  clean but had to be careful not to wear 'em out wid de paddle.    We had no tubs either, so father took a hollow log and split it open  and put partitions in it. He bored a hole in each section and drove a  peg in it. He next cut two forked poles and drove 'em in de ground and  rested de ends of de hollow log in dese forks. We'd fill de log trough  wid water and rinse our clothes. We could pull out de pegs and let de  water out. We had no brooms either, so we made brush brooms to sweep  our floors.    Dere was lots of wild game near our home. I 'member father and two  more men going out and killing six deer in jest a little while. Dey  was plentiful, and so was squirrels, coon, possums and quail. Dere was  lots of bears, too. We'd be in de field working and hear de dogs, and  father and de boys would go to 'em and maybe dey'd have a bear. We  liked bear meat. It was dark, but awful good and sweet.    De grown folks used to have big times at log-rollings, corn-shuckings  and quiltings. Dey'd have a big supper and a big dance at night. Us  children would play ring plays, play with home-made rag dolls, or we'd  take big leaves and pin 'em together wid thorns and make hats and  dresses. We'd ride saplings, too. All of us would pull a sapling down  and one would climb up in it near de top and git a good hold on it,  and dey would turn it loose. It took a purty good holding to stay wid  it, I can tell you.    All de ladies rode horseback, and dey rode side-saddles. I had a purty  side-saddle when I growed up. De saddle seat was flowered plush. I had  a purty riding habit, too. De skirt was so long dat it almost touched  de ground.    We spun and wove all our clothes. I had to spin three broaches ever  night before bedtime. Mother would take bark and make dye to give us  different colored dresses.    Red oak and sweet gum made purple. Bois d'arc made yellow or orange.  Walnut made a purty brown. We knitted our socks and stockings, too.    We celebrated Christmas by having a big dance and egg-nog for ever'  body.    During slavery young colored boys and girls didn't do much work but  just growed up, care-free and happy. De first work boys done was to  learn to hitch up de team to Master's carriage and take de young folks  for a drive.    My older brothers and sisters told me lots of things dey done during  slave days. My brother Joe felt mighty big after freedom and strutted  about. One day he took his younger brother, Ol wid him to where father  was building a house. Dey played 'bout de house and come up to where a  white man and father was talking. De white man was rolling a little  ball of mud in his hands and he just pitched it over on Ol's foot. It  didn't hurt him a mite, but Joe bridled up and he started to git  smart, and father told him he'd break his neck if he didn't go on home  and keep his mouth shet. Father finally had to whup Joe to make him  know he was black. He give father and mother lots of concern, for dey  was afraid the Ku Kluxers would git him. One day he was playing wid a  axe and chopped off brother Ol's finger. Mother told him she was going  to kill him when she caught him. He took to de woods. His three  sisters and two neighbor girls run him nearly all day but couldn't  catch him. Late in de evening, he come up to a white neighbor's house  and she told him to go in and git under de bed and dey couldn't find  him. Curtains come down to de floor and as he was tired he decided to  risk it. He hadn't much more dan got hid when he heard de girls  coming. He heard de woman say, \"He's under de bed.\" He knowed he was  caught, and he put up a fight, but dey took him to mother. He got a  whupping, but he was shocked dat mother didn't kill him like she said  she was. He didn't mind de whupping. He growed up to be a good man,  and was de apple of my mother's eye.    Father knowed a man that stole his Master's horse out and rode him to  a dance. For some reason de horse died. De poor man knowed he was up  against it, and he let in to begging de men to help him git de horse  on his back so he could put him back in his stable and his Master  would think he died dere. Poor fellow, he really did think he could  tote dat horse on his back. He couldn't git anybody to help him, so he  went to the woods. He was shot by a patroller 'cause he wouldn't  surrender. Dey captured him but he died.    Paul Castleberry was a white preacher. De colored would go to church  de same as de whites. He give de colored instructions on obeying  Masters. He say, \"while your Master is going f'om pillar to post,  looking after your intrusts, you is always doing some devilment.\" I  'spect dat was jest about de truth.    My sister played wid Miss Millie's little girl, Mollie. De big house  was on a high hill and at de foot of de hill. Nearly a half-mile away  was a big creek wid a big wooden bridge across it. Soldiers come by  ever' few days, and you could hear deir horses when dey struck de  bridge. Sister and Mollie would run upstairs and look down de hill,  and if it was Confederate soldiers dey would run back and tell Miss  Millie and dey would start putting out de best food dey had. If dey  saw Yankee soldiers, dey would run down and tell 'em and dey'd start  hiding things.    De Yankees come through dere and took ever' body's horses. Lots of  people took deir horses and cows and hid 'em in some low place in de  deep wood.    Miss Millie had a young horse and she had 'em take him to de wheat  field and hide him. De wheat was as high as he was. De Yankees come  by, and a man had stopped dere just before dey come. He was riding an  old horse, and he was wearing a long linen-duster--a duster was a long  coat dat was worn over de suit to protect it from de dust.    Dis smart-aleck hid behind de house and as de soldiers rode up he shot  at 'em. Dey started shooting at him and he started running, and his  coat was sticking straight out behind him. De soldiers surely wasn't  trying to hit him, but dey sure did scare him plenty. Miss Millie was  certain dey was going to find her horse but dey didn't.    Master John Rogers was good to all his slaves, and they all loved him  and would a'died for him. One day he was sitting in his yard and  Mollie come running down stairs and told him de Yankees was coming. He  never say nothing, but kept sitting dere. Dat morning he had a big  sack of money and he give it to my mother to hide for him. She ripped  her mattress, and put it in de middle of it and sewed it up. She den  made up de bed and put de covers on it. De Yankees searched de house  and took de jewelry and silverware and old Master's gold mug, but dey  didn't find his money.    My parents lived close to de old plantation dat they lived on when dey  was slaves. De big house was still dere, but it was sure dilapidated.  Ever'body was poor after de War, whites and blacks alike. I really  think de colored was de best off, for they knowed all 'bout hardships  and hard work and de white folks didn't.    At first some of 'em was too proud to do drudgery work, but most of  'em went right to "]]]
