I have to leave certain  instructions for Weymouth at the rendezvous!\"    There was a hidden significance in his manner, and, my memory harking  back to an adventure which we had shared in the past, I suddenly  glimpsed the depths of my own stupidity.    He suspected the presence of an eavesdropper! Yes! incredible though  it might appear, we were spied upon in the New Louvre; agents of the  Si-Fan, of Dr. Fu-Manchu, were actually within the walls of the great  hotel!    We hurried out into the corridor, and descended by the lift to the  lobby. M. Samarkan, long famous as _maitre d'hotel_ of one of Cairo's  fashionable _khans_, and now principal of the New Louvre, greeted us  with true Greek courtesy. He trusted that we should be present at  some charitable function or other to be held at the hotel on the  following evening.    \"If possible, M. Samarkan--if possible,\" said Smith. \"We have many  demands upon our time.\" Then, abruptly, to me: \"Come, Petrie, we will  walk as far as Charing Cross and take a cab from the rank there.\"    \"The hall-porter can call you a cab,\" said M. Samarkan, solicitous for  the comfort of his guests.    \"Thanks,\" snapped Smith; \"we prefer to walk a little way.\"    Passing along the Strand, he took my arm, and speaking close to my ear--    \"That place is alive with spies, Petrie,\" he said; \"or if there are  only a few of them they are remarkably efficient!\"    Not another word could I get from him, although I was eager enough to  talk; since one dearer to me than all else in the world was in the  hands of the damnable organization we knew as the Si-Fan; until,  arrived at Charing Cross, he walked out to the cab rank, and--    \"Jump in!\" he snapped.    He opened the door of the first cab on the rank.    \"Drive to J---- Street, Kennington,\" he directed the man.    In something of a mental stupor I entered and found myself seated  beside Smith. The cab made off towards Trafalgar Square, then swung  around into Whitehall.    \"Look behind!\" cried Smith, intense excitement expressed in his voice--  \"look behind!\"    I turned and peered through the little square window.    The cab which had stood second upon the rank was closely following us!    \"We are tracked!\" snapped my companion. \"If further evidence were  necessary of the fact that our every movement is watched, here it is!\"    I turned to him, momentarily at a loss for words; then--    \"Was this the object of our journey?\" I said. \"Your reference to a  'rendezvous' was presumably addressed to a hypothetical spy?    \"Partly,\" he replied. \"I have a plan, as you will see in a moment.\"    I looked again from the window in the rear of the cab. We were now  passing between the House of Lords and the back of Westminster Abbey ...  and fifty yards behind us the  pursuing cab was crossing from  Whitehall! A great excitement grew up within me, and a great curiosity  respecting the identity of our pursuer.    \"What is the place for which we are bound, Smith?\" I said rapidly.    \"It is a house which I chanced to notice a few days ago, and I marked  it as useful for such a purpose as our present one. You will see what  I mean when we arrive.\"    On we went, following the course of the river, then turned over  Vauxhall Bridge and on down Vauxhall Bridge Road into a very dreary  neighborhood where gasometers formed the notable feature of the  landscape.    \"That's the Oval just beyond,\" said Smith suddenly, \"and--here we are.\"    In a narrow _cul de sac_ which apparently communicated with the  boundary of the famous cricket ground, the cabman pulled up. Smith  jumped out and paid the fare.    \"Pull back to that court with the iron posts,\" he directed the man,  \"and wait there for me.\" Then: \"Come on, Petrie!\" he snapped.    Side by side we entered the wooden gate of a small detached house, or  more properly cottage, and passed up the tiled path towards a sort of  side entrance which apparently gave access to the tiny garden. At this  moment I became aware of two things; the first, that the house was an  empty one, and the second, that some one--some one who had quitted the  second cab (which I had heard pull up at no great distance behind us)  was approaching stealthily along the dark and uninviting street,  walking upon the opposite pavement and taking advantage of the shadow  of a high wooden fence which skirted it for some distance.    Smith pushed the gate open, and I found myself in a narrow passageway  in almost complete darkness. But my friend walked confidently forward,  turned the angle of the building and entered the miniature wilderness  which once had been a garden.    \"In here, Petrie!\" he whispered.    He seized me by the arm, pushed open a door and thrust me forward down  two stone steps into absolute darkness.    \"Walk straight ahead!\" he directed, still in the same intense whisper,  \"and you will find a locked door having a broken panel. Watch through  the opening for any one who may enter the room beyond, but see that  your presence is not detected. Whatever I say or do, don't stir until  I actually rejoin you.\"    He stepped back across the floor and was gone. One glimpse I had of  him, silhouetted against the faint light of the open door, then the  door was gently closed, and I was left alone in the empty house.    Smith's  methods frequently surprised me, but always in the past I had  found that they were dictated by sound reasons. I had no doubt that an  emergency unknown to me dictated his present course, but it was with  my mind in a wildly confused condition, that I groped for and found  the door with the broken panel and that I stood there in the complete  darkness of the deserted house listening.    I can well appreciate how the blind develop an unusually keen sense of  hearing; for there, in the blackness, which (at first) was entirely  unrelieved by any speck of light, I became aware of the fact, by dint  of tense listening, that Smith was retiring by means of some gateway  at the upper end of the little garden, and I became aware of the fact  that a lane or court, with which this gateway communicated, gave  access to the main road.    Faintly, I heard our discharged cab backing out from the _cul de sac_;  then, from some nearer place, came Smith's voice speaking loudly.    \"Come along, Petrie!\" he cried; \"there is no occasion for us to wait.  Weymouth will see the note pinned on the door.\"    I started--and was about to stumble back across the room, when, as my  mind began to work more clearly, I realized that the words had been  spoken as a ruse--a favorite device of Nayland Smith's.    Rigidly I stood there, and continued to listen.    \"All right, cabman!\" came more distantly now; \"back to the New Louvre--  jump in, Petrie!\"    The cab went rattling away ... as a faint light became perceptible in  the room beyond the broken panel.    Hitherto I had been able to detect the presence of this panel only by  my sense of touch and by means of a faint draught which blew through  it; now it suddenly became clearly perceptible. I found myself looking  into what was evidently the principal room of the house--a dreary  apartment with tatters of paper hanging from the walls and litter of  all sorts lying about upon the floor and in the rusty fireplace.    Some one had partly raised the front window and opened the shutters.  A patch of moonlight shone down upon the floor immediately below my  hiding-place and furthermore enabled me vaguely to discern the disorder  of the room.    A bulky figure showed silhouetted against the dirty panes. It was that  of a man who, leaning upon the window sill, was peering intently in.  Silently he had approached, and silently had raised the sash and  opened the shutters.    For thirty seconds or more he stood so, moving his head from right to  left ... and I watched him through the broken panel, almost holding my  breath with suspense. Then, fully raising the window, the man stepped  into the room, and, first reclosing the shutters, suddenly flashed the  light of an electric lamp all about the place. I was enabled to  discern him more clearly, this mysterious spy who had tracked us from  the moment that we had left the hotel.    He was a man of portly build wearing a heavy fur-lined overcoat and  having a soft felt hat, the brim turned down so as to shade the upper  part of his face. Moreover, he wore his fur collar turned up, which  served further to disguise him, since it concealed the greater part  of his chin. But the eyes which now were searching every corner of  the room, the alert, dark eyes, were strangely familiar. The black  mustache, the clear-cut, aquiline nose, confirmed the impression.    Our follower was M. Samarkan, manager of the New Louvre.    I suppressed a gasp of astonishment. Small wonder that our plans had  leaked out. This was a momentous discovery indeed.    And as I watched the portly Greek who was not only one of the most  celebrated _maitres d'hotel_ in Europe, but also a creature of Dr.  Fu-Manchu, he cast the light of his electric lamp upon a note attached  by means of a drawing-pin to the inside of the room door. I  immediately divined that my friend must have pinned the note in its  place earlier in the day; even at that distance I recognized Smith's  neat, illegible writing.    Samarkan quickly scanned the message scribbled upon the white page;  then, exhibiting an agility uncommon in a man of his bulk, he threw  open the shutters again, having first replaced his lamp in his pocket,  climbed out into the little front garden, reclosed the window, and  disappeared!    A moment I stood, lost to my surroundings, plunged in a sea of  wonderment concerning the damnable organization which, its tentacles  extending I knew not whither, since new and unexpected limbs were ever  coming to light, sought no less a goal than Yellow dominion of the  world!

Thanks to its raw material endowment, a technically    skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial firms,    Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and services    (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed itself with    only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. Increased export sales    resulting from German unification, boosted Austria's economy through    1991, but Austria's GDP growth slowed to 2% in 1992 and -0.5% in 1993    due to the weak international economy, particularly in Germany - its    largest trading partner. GDP growth will resume slowly in 1994, with    estimates ranging from a 0.5% to a 1% increase. Unemployment has risen    to 7% as a result of the slowdown and will continue to rise in 1994.    Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level of    subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary    capabilities. Austria's government has taken measures to make the    economy more liberal and open by introducing a major tax reform,    privatizing state-owned firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital    movements. Although it will face increased competition, Austria should    benefit from the continued opening of eastern European markets, as    well as the 1 January 1994 start of the European Economic Area which    extends the European Union rules on the free movement of people,    capital, and goods and services to four members (including Austria) of    the"]]]
