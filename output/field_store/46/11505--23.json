[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16831"],[0,"The Improvement of Human Reason (#18)"],[1,"he was most deeply immers'd in the  Contemplation of the _first, true, necessarily self-existent Being_.  Which concern'd him very much, for he knew that even this was a Mixture  in this simple Vision, and the Admission of an extraneous Object in that  Contemplation. Upon which he endeavour'd to disappear from himself, and  be wholly taken up in the Vision of that _true Being_; till at last he  attain'd it; and then both the Heavens and the Earth, and whatsoever is  between them, and all Spiritual Forms, and Corporeal Faculties; and all  those Powers which are separate from Matter, and are those Beings which  know the _necessarily self-existent Being_, all disappear'd and  vanish'd, and were as if they had never been, and amongst these his own  Being disappear'd too, and there remain'd nothing but this ONE, TRUE,  Perpetually Self-existent Being, who spoke thus in that Saying of his  (which is not a Notion superadded to his Essence.) _To whom now belongs  the Kingdom? To this One, Almighty God_.[22] Which Words of his _Hai Ebn  Yokdhan_ understood, and heard his Voice; nor was his being unacquainted  with Words, and not being able to speak, any Hindrance at all to the  understanding him. Wherefore he deeply immers'd himself into this State,  and witness'd that which neither Eye hath seen, nor Ear heard; nor hath  it ever enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive.    Sec. 85. And now, don't expect that I should give thee a Description of  that, which the Heart of Man cannot conceive. For if a great many of  thole things which we do conceive are nevertheless hard to be explain'd,  how much more difficult must those be which cannot be conceiv'd by the  Heart, nor are circumscrib'd in the Limits of that World in which it  converses. Now, when I say the Heart, I don't mean the Substance of it,  nor that Spirit which is contain'd in the Cavity of it; but I mean by  it, the Form of that Spirit which is diffus'd by its Faculties through  the whole Body of Man. Now every one of these three is sometimes call'd  the Heart, but 'tis impossible that this thing which I mean should be  comprehended by any of these three, neither can we express any thing by  Words, which is not first conceiv'd in the Heart. And whosoever asks to  have it explain'd, asks an Impossibility; for 'tis just as if a Man  should have a mind to taste Colours, _quatenas_ Colours, and desire,  that _black_ should be either _sweet_ or _sowre._ However, I shall not  dismiss you without some Limits, whereby I shall point out to you in  some Measure, what wonderful things he saw when in this Condition, but  all figuratively, and by way of Parable; not pretending to give a  literal Description of that, which is impossible to be known, but by  coming thither. Attend therefore with the Ears of thy Heart, and look  sharply with the Eyes of thy Understanding, upon that which I shall shew  thee; it may be thou may'st find so much in it, as may serve to lead  thee into the right way. But I make this Bargain, that thou shalt not at  present require any further Explication of it by Word of Mouth; but rest  thy self contented with what I shall commit to these Papers. For 'tis a  narrow Field, and 'tis dangerous to attempt the explaining of that with  Words, the Nature of which admits no Explication.    Sec. 86. I say then, when he had abstracted himself from his own and all  other Essences, and beheld nothing in Nature, but only that _One, Living  and Permanent Being_: When he saw what he saw, and then afterwards  return'd to the beholding of other Things: Upon his Coming to himself  from that State (which was like Drunkenness) he began to think that his  own Essence did not at all differ from the Essence of that _TRUE Being_,  but that they were both one and the same thing; and that the thing which  he had taken before for his own Essence, distinct from that _true_  Essence was in reality nothing at all, and that there was nothing in him  but this _true Essence_. And that this was like the Light of the Sun,  which, when it falls upon solid Bodies, shines there; and though it be  attributed, or may seem to belong to that Body upon which it appears,  yet it is nothing else in reality, but the Light of the Sun. And if that  Body be remov'd, its Light also is remov'd; but the Light of the Sun  remains still after the same manner, and is neither increas'd by the  Presence of that Body, nor diminish'd by its Absence. Now when there  happens to be a Body which is fitted for such a Reception of Light, it  receives it; if such a Body be absent, then there is no such Reception,  and it signifies nothing at all.    Sec. 87. He was the more confirm'd in this Opinion, because it appeared to  him before, that this _TRUE Powerful_ and _Glorious Being_, was not by  any means capable of _Multiplicity_, and that his Knowledge of his  Essence, was his very Essence, from whence he argued thus:         _He that has the Knowledge of this Essence has the Essence itself;       hut I have the knowledge of this Essence._ Ergo, _I have the       Essence itself_.    Now this Essence can be present no where but with itself, and its very  Presence is Essence; and therefore he concluded that he was that very  Essence. And to all other Essences which were separate from Matter,  which had the Knowledge of that _true Essence_, though before he had  looked upon them as _many,_ by this way of thinking, appear'd to him to  be only one thing. And this misgrounded Conceit of his, had like to have  firmly rooted itself in his Mind, unless God had pursu'd him with his  Mercy, and directed him by his gracious Guidance; and then he perceiv'd  that it arose from the Relicks of that Obscurity which is natural to  Body, and the Dregs of sensible Objects. Because that _Much_ and  _Little, Unity_ and _Multiplicity_, _Collection_ and _Separation_, are  all of them Properties of Body. But we cannot say of these separate  Essences, which know this _TRUE Being_ (whose Name be prais'd) that they  are _many_ or _one_, because they are immaterial. Now, _Multiplicity_ is  because of the Difference of one Being from another, and there can be no  _Unity_ but by _Conjunction_, and none of these can be understood  without Compound Notions which are mix'd with Matter. Besides, that the  Explication of Things in this place is very straight and difficult;  because if you go about to express what belongs to these separate  Essences, by way of Multitude, or in the _Plural_, according to our way  of speaking, this insinuates a Notion of _Multiplicity_, whereas they  are far from being _many_; and if you speak of them by way of  Separation, or in the Singular, this insinuates a Notion of Unity,  whereas they are far from being _one_.    Sec. 88. And here methinks I fee one of those Batts, whose Eyes the Sun  dazzles, moving himself in the Chain of his Folly, and saying, _This  Subtilty of yours exceeds all Bounds, for you have withdrawn your self  from the State and Condition of understanding Men, and indeed thrown  away the Nature of Intelligible Things, for this is a certain Axiom,  that a thing must be either one, or more than one_. Soft and fair; let  that Gentleman be pleas'd to consider with himself, and contemplate this  vile, sensible World, after the same manner which _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ did,  who, when he consider'd it one way, sound such a Multiplicity in it, as  was incomprehensible; and then again considering it another way,  perceiv'd that it was only one thing; and thus he continu'd fluctuating,  and could not determine on one side more than another. Now if it were so  in this sensible World, which is the proper place of _Multiplicity_ and  _Singularity_, and the place where the true Nature of them is  understood, and in which are _Separation_ and _Union, Division_ into  Parts, and _Distinction, Agreement_ and _Difference_, what would he  think of the Divine World, in, or concerning which we cannot justly say,  _all_ nor _some_, nor express any thing belonging to it by such Words as  our Ears are us'd to, without insinuating some Notion which is contrary  to the Truth of the thing, which no Man knows but he that has seen it,  nor understands; but he that has attain'd to it.    Sec. 89. And as for his saying, _That I have withdrawn myself from the  State and Condition of understanding Men, and thrown away the Nature of  Intelligible Things_: I grant it, and leave him to his Understanding,  and his understanding Men he speaks of. For that Understanding which he,  and such as he, mean, is nothing else but that Rational Faculty which  examines the Individuals of Sensible Things, and from thence gets an  Universal Notion; and those understanding Men he means, are those which  make use of this sort of Separation. But that kind, which we are now  speaking of, is above all this; and therefore let every one that knows  nothing but Sensible Things and their Universals, shut his Ears, and  pack away to his Company, who know the outside of the Things of this  World, but take no care of the next. But if thou art one of them to whom  these Limits and Signs by which we describe the Divine World are  sufficient, and dost not put that Sense upon my Words in which they are  commonly us'd[23], I shall give thee some farther Account of what _Hai  Ebn Yokdhan_ saw, when he was in the State of those who have attain'd to  the Truth, of which we have made Mention before, and it is thus;    Sec. 90. After he was wholly immers'd in the Speculation of these things,  and perfectly abstracted from all other Objects, and in the nearest  Approach[24]; he saw in the highest Sphere, beyond which there is no  _Body_, a Being free from Matter, which was not the Being of that _ONE,  TRUE ONE_, nor the Sphere itself, nor yet any thing different from them  both; but was like the Image of the Sun which appears in a well-polish'd  Looking-glass, which is neither the Sun nor the Looking-glass, and yet  not distinct from them. And he saw in the Essence of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#18)"],[1,"relics of all four; statues of them all stand in  the beautiful Ananda Pagoda at Pagan and not infrequently they are  represented by four sitting figures facing the four quarters. A  gigantic group of this kind composed of statues nearly 90 feet high  stands in the outskirts of Pegu, and in the same neighbourhood is  a still larger recumbent figure 180 feet long. It had been forgotten  since the capture of Pegu by the Burmans in 1757 and was rediscovered  by the engineers surveying the route for the railway. It lies almost  in sight of the line and is surprising by its mere size, as one comes  upon it suddenly in the jungle. As a work of art it can hardly be  praised. It does not suggest the Buddha on his death bed, as is  intended, but rather some huge spirit of the jungle waking up and  watching the railway with indolent amusement.    In Upper Burma there are not so many large images but as one  approaches Mandalay the pagodas add more and more to the landscape.  Many are golden and the rest are mostly white and conspicuous. They  crown the hills and punctuate the windings of the valleys. Perhaps  Burmese art and nature are seen at their best near Sagaing on the bank  of the Irrawaddy, a mighty flood of yellow water, sweeping down smooth  and steady, but here and there showing whirlpools that look like  molten metal. From the shore rise hills of moderate height studded  with monasteries and shrines. Flights of white steps lead to the  principal summits where golden spires gleam and everywhere are pagodas  of all ages, shapes and sizes. Like most Asiatics the Burmese rarely  repair, but build new pagodas instead of renovating the old ones. The  instinct is not altogether unjust. A pagoda does not collapse like a  hollow building but understands the art of growing old. Like a tree it  may become cleft or overgrown with moss but it remains picturesque. In  the neighbourhood of Sagaing there is a veritable forest of pagodas;  humble seedlings built by widows' mites, mature golden domes reared by  devout prosperity and venerable ruins decomposing as all compound  things must do.    The pagoda slaves are a curious institution connected with temples.  Under the Burmese kings persons could be dedicated to pagodas and by  this process not only became slaves for life themselves but involved  in the same servitude all their posterity, none of whom could by any  method become free. They formed a low caste like the Indian Pariahs  and though the British Government has abolished the legal status of  slavery, the social stigma which clings to them is said to be  undiminished.    Art and architecture make the picture of Burma as it remains in  memory and they are the faithful reflection of the character and ways  of its inhabitants, their cheerful but religious temper, their love of  what is fanciful and graceful, their moderate aspirations towards what  is arduous and sublime. The most striking feature of this architecture  is its free use of gold and colour. In no country of the world is  gilding and plating with gold so lavishly employed on the exterior of  buildings. The larger Pagodas such as the Shwe Dagon are veritable  pyramids of gold, and the roofs of the Arakan temple as they rise  above Mandalay show tier upon tier of golden beams and plates. The  brilliancy is increased by the equally lavish use of vermilion,  sometimes diversified by glass mosaic. I remember once in an East  African jungle seeing a clump of flowers of such brilliant red and  yellow that for a moment I thought it was a fire. Somewhat similar is  the surprise with which one first gazes on these edifices. I do not  know whether the epithet flamboyant can be correctly applied to them  as architecture but both in colour and shape they imitate a pile of  flame, for the outlines of monasteries and shrines are fanciful in the  extreme; gabled roofs with finials like tongues of fire and panels  rich with carvings and fret-work. The buildings of Hindus and Burmans  are as different as their characters. When a Hindu temple is imposing  it is usually because of its bulk and mystery, whereas these buildings  are lighthearted and fairy-like: heaps of red and yellow fruit with  twining leaves and tendrils that have grown by magic. Nor is there  much resemblance to Japanese architecture. There also, lacquer and  gold are employed to an unusual extent but the flourishes, horns and  finials which in Burma spring from every corner and projection are  wanting and both Japanese and Chinese artists are more sparing and  reticent. They distribute ornament so as to emphasize and lead up to  the more important parts of their buildings, whereas the open-handed,  splendour-loving Burman puts on every panel and pillar as much  decoration as it will hold.    The result must be looked at as a whole and not too minutely. The best  work is the wood carving which has a freedom and boldness often  missing in the minute and crowded designs of Indian art. Still as a  rule it is at the risk of breaking the spell that you examine the  details of Burmese ornamentation. Better rest content with your first  amazement on beholding these carved and pinnacled piles of gold  and vermilion, where the fantastic animals and plants seem about to  break into life.    The most celebrated shrine in Burma is the Shwe Dagon Pagoda which  attracts pilgrims from all the Buddhist world. No descriptions of it  gave me any idea of its real appearance nor can I hope that I shall be  more successful in giving the reader my own impressions. The pagoda  itself is a gilt bell-shaped mass rather higher than the Dome of St.  Paul's and terminating in a spire. It is set in the centre of a raised  mound or platform, approached by lofty flights of steps. The platform,  which is paved and level, is of imposing dimensions, some nine hundred  feet long and seven hundred wide. Round the base of the central pagoda  is a row of shrines and another row runs round the edge of the  platform so that one moves, as it were, in a street of these edifices,  leading here and there into side squares where are quiet retreats with  palm trees and gigantic images. But when after climbing the long  staircase one first emerges on the platform one does not realize the  topography at once and seems to have entered suddenly into Jerusalem  the Golden. Right and left are rows of gorgeous, fantastic  sanctuaries, all gold, vermilion and glass mosaic, and within them sit  marble figures, bland, enigmatic personages who seem to invite  approach but offer no explanation of the singular scene or the part  they play in it. If analyzed in detail the artistic merits of these  shrines might be found small but the total impression is unique. The  Shwe Dagon has not the qualities which usually distinguish great  religious buildings. It is not specially impressive by its majesty or  holiness; it is certainly wanting in order and arrangement. But on  entering the platform one feels that one has suddenly passed from this  life into another and different world. It is not perhaps a very  elevated world; certainly not the final repose of the just or the  steps of the throne of God, but it is as if you were walking in the  bazaars of Paradise--one of those Buddhist Paradises where the souls  of the moderately pure find temporary rest from the whirl of  transmigration, where the very lotus flowers are golden and the leaves  of the trees are golden bells that tinkle in the perfumed breeze.
