IX, 3.          \"In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy. ...\"      In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy. All praise and glory  befitteth the sacred and glorious court of the sovereign Lord, Who from  everlasting hath dwelt, and unto everlasting will continue to dwell within  the mystery of His Own divine Essence, Who from time immemorial hath  abided and will forever continue to abide within His transcendent  eternity, exalted above the reach and ken of all created beings. The sign  of His matchless Revelation as created by Him and imprinted upon the  realities of all beings, is none other but their powerlessness to know  Him. The light He hath shed upon all things is none but the splendour of  His Own Self. He Himself hath at all times been immeasurably exalted above  any association with His creatures. He hath fashioned the entire creation  in such wise that all beings may, by virtue of their innate powers, bear  witness before God on the Day of Resurrection that He hath no peer or  equal and is sanctified from any likeness, similitude or comparison. He  hath been and will ever be one and incomparable in the transcendent glory  of His divine being and He hath ever been indescribably mighty in the  sublimity of His sovereign Lordship. No one hath ever been able  befittingly to recognize Him nor will any man succeed at any time in  comprehending Him as is truly meet and seemly, for any reality to which  the term 'being' is applicable hath been created by the sovereign Will of  the Almighty, Who hath shed upon it the radiance of His Own Self, shining  forth from His most august station. He hath moreover deposited within the  realities of all created things the emblem of His recognition, that  everyone may know of a certainty that He is the Beginning and the End, the  Manifest and the Hidden, the Maker and the Sustainer, the Omnipotent and  the All-Knowing, the One Who heareth and perceiveth all things, He Who is  invincible in His power and standeth supreme in His Own identity, He Who  quickeneth and causeth to die, the All-Powerful, the Inaccessible, the  Most Exalted, the Most High. Every revelation of His divine Essence  betokens the sublimity of His glory, the loftiness of His sanctity, the  inaccessible height of His oneness and the exaltation of His majesty and  power. His beginning hath had no beginning other than His Own firstness  and His end knoweth no end save His Own lastness. I, 1.          \"The revelation of the Divine Reality hath everlastingly ...\"      The revelation of the Divine Reality hath everlastingly been identical  with its concealment and its concealment identical with its revelation.  That which is intended by 'Revelation of God' is the Tree of divine Truth  that betokeneth none but Him, and it is this divine Tree that hath raised  and will raise up Messengers, and hath revealed and will ever reveal  Scriptures. From eternity unto eternity this Tree of divine Truth hath  served and will ever serve as the throne of the revelation and concealment  of God among His creatures, and in every age is made manifest through  whomsoever He pleaseth. At the time of the revelation of the Qur'an He  asserted His transcendent power through the advent of Muhammad, and on the  occasion of the revelation of the Bayan He demonstrated His sovereign  might through the appearance of the Point of the Bayan, and when He Whom  God shall make manifest will shine forth, it will be through Him that He  will vindicate the truth of His Faith, as He pleaseth, with whatsoever He  pleaseth and for whatsoever He pleaseth. He is with all things, yet  nothing is with Him. He is not within a thing nor above it nor beside it.  Any reference to His being established upon the throne implieth that the  Exponent of His Revelation is established upon the seat of transcendent  authority...    He hath everlastingly existed and will everlastingly continue to exist. He  hath been and will ever remain inscrutable unto all men, inasmuch as all  else besides Him have been and shall ever be created through the potency  of His command. He is exalted above every mention or praise and is  sanctified beyond every word of commendation or every comparison. No  created thing comprehendeth Him, while He in truth comprehendeth all  things. Even when it is said 'no created thing comprehendeth Him', this  refers to the Mirror of His Revelation, that is Him Whom God shall make  manifest. Indeed too high and exalted is He for anyone to allude unto Him.  II, 8.            4: EXCERPTS FROM DALA'IL-I-SAB'IH (THE SEVEN PROOFS)          \"Thou hast asked concerning the fundamentals ...\"      Thou hast asked concerning the fundamentals of religion and its  ordinances: Know thou that first and foremost in religion is the knowledge  of God. This attaineth its consummation in the recognition of His divine  unity, which in turn reacheth its fulfilment in acclaiming that His  hallowed and exalted Sanctuary, the Seat of His transcendent majesty, is  sanctified from all attributes. And know thou that in this world of being  the knowledge of God can never be attained save through the knowledge of  Him Who is the Dayspring of divine Reality.          \"Gracious God! Within the domains of Islam there are ...\"      Gracious God! Within the domains of Islam there are at present seven  powerful sovereigns ruling the world. None of them hath been informed of  His [the Bab's] Manifestation, and if informed, none hath believed in Him.  Who knoweth, they may leave this world below full of desire, and without  having realized that the thing for which they were waiting had come to  pass. This is what happened to the monarchs that held fast unto the  Gospel. They awaited the coming of the Prophet of God [Muhammad], and when  He did appear, they failed to recognize Him. Behold how great are the sums  which these sovereigns expend without even the slightest thought of  appointing an official charged with the task of acquainting them in their  own realms with the Manifestation of God! They would thereby have  fulfilled the purpose for which they have been created. All their desires  have been and are still fixed upon leaving behind them traces of their  names.          \"Ponder likewise the Dispensation of the Apostle of God ...\"      Ponder likewise the Dispensation of the Apostle of God which lasted twelve  hundred and seventy years(67) till the dawn of the manifestation of the  Bayan. He directed everyone to await the advent of the Promised Qa'im. All  deeds which in the Islamic Dispensation began with Muhammad should find  their consummation through the appearance of the Qa'im. God hath made Him  manifest invested with the proof wherewith the Apostle of God was  invested, so that none of the believers in the Qur'an might entertain  doubts about the validity of His Cause, for it is set down in the Qur'an  that none but God is capable of revealing verses. During the period of  1270 years no one among the followers of the Qur'an ever witnessed a  person appearing with conclusive proofs. Now the Ever-Living Lord hath  made manifest and invested with supreme testimony this long-awaited  Promised One from a place no one could imagine and from a person whose  knowledge was deemed of no account. His age is no more than twenty-five  years, yet His glory is such as none of the learned among the people of  Islam can rival; inasmuch as man's glory lieth in his knowledge. Behold  the learned who are honoured by virtue of their ability to understand the  Holy Writings, and God hath exalted them to such a degree that in  referring to them He saith: 'None knoweth the meaning thereof except God  and them that are well-grounded in knowledge.'(68) How strange then that  this twenty-five-year-old untutored one should be singled out to reveal  His verses in so astounding a manner. If the Muslim divines have cause for  pride in understanding the meaning of the Holy Writings, His glory is in  revealing the Writings, that none of them may hesitate to believe in His  Words. So great is the celestial might and power which God hath revealed  in Him that if it were His will and no break should intervene He could,  within the space of five days and nights, reveal the equivalent of the  Qur'an which was sent down in twenty-three years. Ponder thou and reflect.  Hath anyone like unto Him ever appeared in former times, or is this  characteristic strictly confined unto Him?          \"Consider the manifold favours vouchsafed by the ...\"      Consider the manifold favours vouchsafed by the Promised One, and the  effusions of His bounty which have pervaded the concourse of the followers  of Islam to enable them to attain unto salvation. Indeed observe how He  Who representeth the origin of creation, He Who is the Exponent of the  verse, 'I, in very truth, am God', identified Himself as the Gate [Bab]  for the advent of the promised Qa'im, a descendant of Muhammad, and in His  first Book enjoined the observance of the laws of the Qur'an, so that the  people might not be seized with perturbation by reason of a new Book and a  new Revelation and might regard His Faith as similar to their own,  perchance they would not turn away from the Truth and ignore the thing for  which they had been called into being.          \"Let Me set forth some rational arguments for thee. If ...\"      Let Me set forth some rational arguments for thee. If someone desireth to  embrace the Faith of Islam today, would the testimony of God prove  conclusive for him? If thou dost contend that it would not, then how is it  that God will chastise him after death, and that, while he lives, the  verdict of 'non-believer' is passed upon him? If thou affirmest that the  testimony is conclusive, how wouldst"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],[0,"With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#18)"],[1,"Murari Reo had promised him. When these  arrived, however, they proved unwilling to accompany him. Upon their  way, they had fallen in with a portion of Riza Sahib's retreating  force, and had been worsted in the attack; and as the chance of  plunder seemed small, while the prospect of hard blows was certain,  the free-booting horsemen refused, absolutely, to join in the pursuit  of the retreating enemy.    Just at this moment, the news came in that reinforcements from  Pondicherry were marching to meet Riza Sahib at Arni, a place  seventeen miles south of Arcot, twenty south of Vellore. It was stated  that, with these reinforcements, a large sum of money was being  brought, for the use of Riza Sahib's army. When the Mahrattas heard  the news, the chance of booty at once altered their intentions, and  they declared themselves ready to follow Clive. The greater portion of  them, however, had dispersed, plundering over the country, and great  delay was caused before they could be collected. When six hundred of  them had been brought together, Clive determined to wait no longer,  but started at once for Arni.    The delay enabled Riza Sahib, marching down from Vellore, to meet his  reinforcements; and when Clive, after a forced march of twenty miles,  approached Arni, he found the enemy, composed of three hundred French  troops, two thousand five hundred Sepoys, and two thousand horsemen,  with four guns, drawn up before it. Seeing their immense superiority  in numbers, these advanced to the attack.    Clive determined to await them where he stood. The position was an  advantageous one. He occupied a space of open ground, some three  hundred yards in width. On his right flank was a village, on the left  a grove of palm trees. In front of the ground he occupied were rice  fields, which, it being the wet season, were very swampy, and  altogether impracticable for guns. These fields were crossed by a  causeway which led to the village, but as it ran at an angle across  them, those advancing upon it were exposed to the fire of the English  front. Clive posted the Sepoys in the village, the Mahratta horsemen  in the grove, and the two hundred English, with the guns, on the  ground between them.    The enemy advanced at once. His native cavalry, with some infantry,  marched against the grove; while the French troops, with about fifteen  hundred infantry, moved along the causeway against the village.    The fight began on the English left. There the Mahratta cavalry fought  bravely. Issuing from the palm grove, they made repeated charges  against the greatly superior forces of the enemy. But numbers told,  and the Mahrattas, fighting fiercely, were driven back into the palm  grove; where they, with difficulty, maintained themselves.    In the meantime, the fight was going on at the centre. Clive opened  fire with his guns on the long column marching, almost across his  front, to attack the village. The enemy, finding themselves exposed to  a fire which they were powerless to answer, quitted the causeway, and  formed up in the rice fields fronting the English position. The guns,  protected only by a few Frenchmen and natives, remained on the  causeway.    Clive now despatched two of his guns, and fifty English, to aid the  hard-pressed Mahrattas in the grove; and fifty others to the village,  with orders to join the Sepoys there, to dash forward on to the  causeway, and charge the enemy's guns.    As the column issued from the village along the causeway, at a rapid  pace, the French limbered up their guns and retired at a gallop. The  infantry, dispirited at their disappearance, fell back across the rice  fields; an example which their horsemen on their right, already  dispirited by the loss which they were suffering, from the  newly-arrived English musketry and the discharges of the field pieces,  followed without delay.    Clive at once ordered a pursuit. The Mahrattas were despatched after  the enemy's cavalry, while he himself, with his infantry, advanced  across the causeway and pressed upon the main body. Three times the  enemy made a stand, but each time failed to resist the impetuosity of  the pursuers, and the night alone put a stop to the pursuit, by which  time the enemy were completely routed.    The material loss had not been heavy, for but fifty French and a  hundred and fifty natives were killed or wounded; but the army was  broken up, the morale of the enemy completely destroyed; and it was  proved to all Southern India, which was anxiously watching the  struggle, that the English were, in the field of battle, superior to  their European rivals. This assurance alone had an immense effect. It  confirmed, in their alliance with the English, many of the chiefs  whose friendship had hitherto been lukewarm; and brought over many  waverers to our side.    In the fight, eight Sepoys and fifty of the Mahratta cavalry were  killed or disabled. The English did not lose a single man. Many of  Riza Sahib's soldiers came in, during the next few days, and enlisted  in the British force. The Mahrattas captured the treasure, the  prospect of which had induced them to join in the fight, and the  governor of Arni agreed to hold the town for Muhammud Ali.    Clive moved on at once to Conjeveram, where thirty French troops and  three hundred Sepoys occupied the temple, a very strong building.  Clive brought up two eighteen-pounders from Madras, and pounded the  walls; and the enemy, seeing that the place must fall, evacuated it in  the night, and retired to Pondicherry. North Arcot being now  completely in the power of the English, Clive returned to Madras; and  then sailed to Fort Saint David, to concert measures with Mr. Saunders  for the relief of Trichinopoli. This place still held out, thanks  rather to the feebleness and indecision of Colonel Law, who commanded  the besiegers, than to any effort on the part of the defenders.    Governor Dupleix, at Pondicherry, had seen with surprise the result of  Clive's dash upon Arcot. He had, however, perceived that the  operations there were wholly secondary, and that Trichinopoli was  still the all-important point. The fall of that place would more than  neutralize Clive's successes at Arcot; and he, therefore, did not  suffer Clive's operations to distract his attention here. Strong  reinforcements and a battering train were sent forward to the  besiegers; and, by repeated messages, he endeavoured to impress upon  Law and Chunda Sahib the necessity of pressing forward the capture of  Trichinopoli.    But Dupleix was unfortunate in his instruments. Law was always  hesitating and doubting. Chunda Sahib, although clever to plan, was  weak in action; indecisive, at moments when it was most necessary that  he should be firm. So then, in spite of the entreaties of Dupleix, he  had detached a considerable force to besiege Clive. Dupleix, seeing  this, and hoping that Clive might be detained at Arcot long enough to  allow of the siege of Trichinopoli being brought to a conclusion, had  sent the three hundred French soldiers to strengthen the force of Riza  Sahib.    He had still an overpowering force at Trichinopoli, Law having nine  hundred trained French soldiers, a park of fifty guns, two thousand  Sepoys, and the army of Chunda Sahib, twenty thousand strong. Inside  Trichinopoli were a few English soldiers under Captain Cope, and a  small body of troops of Muhammud Ali; while outside the walls, between  them and the besiegers, was the English force under Gingen, the men  utterly dispirited, the officer without talent, resolution, or  confidence.    Before leaving the troops with which he had won the battle of Arni,  Clive had expressed, to the two young writers, his high appreciation  of their conduct during the siege of Arcot; and promised them that he  would make it a personal request, to the authorities at Fort Saint  David, that they might be permanently transferred from the civil to  the military branch of the service; and such a request, made by him,  was certain to be complied with. He strongly advised them to spend  every available moment of their time in the study of the native  language; as, without that, they would be useless if appointed to  command a body of Sepoys.    Delighted at the prospect, now open to them, of a permanent relief  from the drudgery of a clerk's life in Madras, the young fellows were  in the highest spirits; and Tim Kelly was scarcely less pleased, when  he heard that Charlie was now likely to be always employed with him.  The boys lost not a moment in sending down to Madras, to engage the  services of a native \"moonshee\" or teacher. They wrote to their friend  Johnson, asking him to arrange terms with the man who understood most  English, and to engage him to remain with them some time.    A few days later, Tim Kelly came in.    \"Plase, yer honors, there's a little shrivelled atomy of a man  outside, as wants to spake wid ye. He looks for all the world like a  monkey, wrapped up in white clothes, but he spakes English after a  fashion, and has brought this letter for you. The cratur scarce looks  like a human being, and I misdoubt me whether you had better let him  in.\"    \"Nonsense, Tim,\" Charlie said, opening the letter; \"it's the moonshee  we are expecting, from Madras. He has come to teach us the native  language.\"    \"Moonshine, is it! By jabers, and it's a mighty poor compliment to the  moon to call him so. And is it the language you're going to larn now?  Shure, Mr. Charles, I wouldn't demane myself by larning the lingo of  these black hathens. Isn't for them to larn the English, and mighty  pleased they ought to be, to get themselves to spake like Christians.\"    \"But who's going to teach them, Tim?\"    \"Oh, they larn fast enough,\" said Tim. \"You've only got to point to a  bottle of water, or to the fire, or whatever else you want, and swear  at them, and they understand directly. I've tried it myself, over and  over again.\"    \"There"]]]
