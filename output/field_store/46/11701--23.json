The king followed him, and Modred drew up his  army at Cambula, in Cornwall, where another battle was fought. In this  engagement Modred was slain, and Arthur also received his death-wound  (pt. xi. 2). The queen, called Guanhuma'ra (but better known as  Guen'evere), retired to a convent in the City of Legions, and entered  the order of Julius the Martyr (pt. xi. 1).--Geoffrey, _British History_  (1142).    [Asterism] This is so very different from the accounts given in  Arthurian romance of Mordred, that it is better to give the two names as  if they were different individuals.    _Modred_ (_Sir_), nephew of King Arthur. He hated Sir Lancelot, and  sowed discord among the knights of the Round Table. Tennyson says that  Modred \"tampered with the lords of the White Horse,\" the brood that  Hengist left. Geoffrey of Monmouth says, he made a league with Cheldric,  the Saxon leader in Germany, and promised to give him all that part of  England which lies between the Humber and Scotland, together with all  that Hengist and Horsa held in Kent, if he would aid him against King  Arthur. Accordingly, Cheldric came over with 800 ships, filled \"with  pagan soldiers\" (_British History_, xi. 1).    When the king was in Brittany, whither he had gone to chastise Sir  Lancelot for adultery with the queen, he left Sir Modred regent, and Sir  Modred raised a revolt. The king returned, drew up his army against the  traitor, and in this \"great battle of the West\" Modred was slain and  Arthur received his death-wound.--Tennyson, _Idylls of the King_  (\"Guinevere,\" 1858).    [Asterism] This version is in accordance neither with Geoffrey of  Monmouth (see previous art.), nor with Arthurian romance (see MORDRED),  and is, therefore, given separately.      =Modu=, the prince of all devils that take possession of a human being.         _Mado_ was the chief devil that had possession of Sarah Williams;       but ... Richard Mainy was molested by a still more considerable       fiend called _Modu_, ... the prince of all other devils.--Harsnett;       _Declaration of Popish Impostures_, 268.      =Modus=, cousin of Helen; a \"musty library, who loved Greek and Latin;\"  but cousin Helen loved the bookworm, and taught him how to love far  better than Ovid could with his _Art of Love_. Having so good a teacher,  Modus became an apt scholar, and eloped with Cousin Helen.--S. Knowles,  _The Hunchback_ (1831).      =Moe'chus=, adultery personified; one of four sons of Caro (_fleshly  lust_). His brothers were Pornei'us (_fornication_), Acath'arus and  Asel'g[^e]s (_lasciviousness_). In the battle of Mansoul, Moechus is slain  by Agnei'a (_wifely chastity_), the spouse of Encra't[^e]s (_temperance_)  and sister of Parthen'ia (_maidenly chastity_). (Greek, _moichos_ \"an  adulterer.\")--Phineas Fletcher, _The Purple Island_, xi. (1633).      =Moeli'ades= (4 _syl._). Under this name William Drummond signalized  Henry, prince of Wales, eldest son of James I., in the monody entitled  _Tears on the Death of Moeliad[:e]s_. The word is an anagram of  _Mil[^e]s a Deo_. The prince, in his masquerades and martial sports,  used to call himself \"Moeliad[^e]s of the Isles.\"        Moeliad[^e]s, bright day-star of the West.        W. Drummond, _Tears on the Death of Moeliades_ (1612).    The burden of the monody is:        Moeliad[^e]s sweet courtly nymphs deplore,      From Thul[^e] to Hydasp[^e]s' pearly shore.      =Moffat= (_Mabel_), domestic of Edward Redgauntlet.--Sir W. Scott,  _Redgauntlet_ (time, George III.).      =Mogg Megone.= Indian sachem who, at the behest of a white girl, kills her  betrayer, and brings his scalp to her. In the storm of anguished remorse  awakened by the sight of the bloody trophy, the woman murders Megone in  his sleep, and is henceforth banned by the church, driven by conscience,  a miserable wanderer upon the earth.--John Greenleaf Whittier, _Mogg  Megone_.      =Moha'di= (_Mahommed_), the twelfth imaum, whom the Orientals believe is  not dead, but is destined to return and combat Antichrist before the  consummation of all things.    [Asterism] Prince Arthur, Merlin, Charlemagne, Barbarossa, Dom  Sebastian, Charles V., Elijah Mansur, Desmond of Kilmallock, etc., are  traditionally not dead, but only sleeping till the fullness of time,  when each will awake and effect most wondrous restorations.      =Mohair= (_The Men of_), the citizens of France.         The men of mohair, as the citizens were called.--_Asylum Christi_,       viii.      =Moha'reb=, one of the evil spirits of Dom-Daniel, a cave \"under the roots  of the ocean.\" It was given out that these spirits would be extirpated  by one of the family of Hodei'rah (3 _syl._), so they leagued against  the whole race. First, Okba was sent against the obnoxious race, and  succeeeded[TN-15] in killing eight of them, Thalaba alone having escaped  alive. Next, Abaldar was sent against Thalaba, but was killed by a  simoom. Then Loba'ba was sent to cut him off, but perished in a  whirlwind. Lastly, Mohareb undertook to destroy him. He assumed the  guise of a warrior, and succeeded in alluring the youth to the very  \"mouth of hell;\" but Thalaba, being alive to the deceit, flung Mohareb  into the abyss.--Southey, _Thalaba, the Destroyer_, v. (1797).      =Mohicans= (_Last of the_), Uncas, the Indian chief, son of Chingachook,  and called \"Deerfoot.\"--J. F. Cooper, _The Last of the Mohicans_ (a  novel, 1826).    The word ought to be pronounced _Mo.hek'.kanz_, but is usually called  _Mo.h[)e].kanz_.      =Mohocks=, a class of ruffians who at one time infested the streets of  London. So called from the Indian Mohocks. At the Restoration, the  street bullies were called Muns and Tityre Tus; they were next called  Hectors and Scourers; later still, Nickers and Hawcabites; and lastly,  Mohocks.        Now is the time that rakes their revels keep,      Kindlers of riot, enemies of sleep;      His scattered pence the flying Nicker flings,      And with the copper shower the casement rings;      Who has not heard the Scowerer's midnight fame?      Who has not trembled at the Mohock's name?        Gay, _Trivia_, iii. 321, etc. (1712).      =Mohun= (_Lord_), the person who joined Captain Hill in a dastardly attack  on the actor, Mountford, on his way to Mrs. Bracegirdle's house, in  Howard Street. Captain Hill was jealous of Mountford, and induced Lord  Mohun to join him in this \"valiant exploit.\" Mountford died next day,  Captain Hill fled from the country, and Mohun was tried but acquitted.    The general features of this cowardly attack are very like that of the  Count Koningsmark on Thomas Thynne of Lingleate Hill. Count Koningsmark  was in love with Elizabeth Percy (widow of the earl of Ogle), who was  contracted to Mr. Thynne; but before the wedding day arrived, the count,  with some hired ruffians, assassinated his rival in his carriage as it  was passing down Pall Mall.    [Asterism] Elizabeth Percy, within three months of the murder, married  the duke of Somerset.      =Moidart= (_John of_), captain of the clan Ronald, and a chief in the army  of Montrose.--Sir W. Scott, _Legend of Montrose_, (time, Charles I.).      =Moi'na= (2 _syl._), daughter of Reutha'mir, the principal man of  Balclu'tha, a town on the Clyde, belonging to the Britons. Moina married  Clessammor (the maternal uncle of Fingal), and died in childbirth of her  son Carthon, during the absence of her husband.--Ossian, _Carthon_.      =Mokanna=, the name given to Hakem ben Haschem, from a silver gauze veil  worn by him \"to dim the lustre of his face,\" or rather to hide its  extreme ugliness. The history of this impostor is given by D'Herbelot,  _Biblioth[`e]que Orientale_ (1697).    [Asterism] Mokanna forms the first story of _Lalla Rookh_ (\"The Veiled  Prophet of Khorassan\"), by Thomas Moore (1817).      =Mokattam= (_Mount_), near Cairo (Egypt), noted for the massacre of the  Caliph Hakem B'amr-ellah, who was given out to be incarnate deity, and  the last prophet who communicated between God and man (eleventh  century). Here, also;[TN-16] fell in the same massacre his chief prophet,  and many of his followers. In consequence of this persecution, Durzi,  one of the \"prophet's\" chief apostles, led the survivors into Syria,  where they settled between the Libanus and Anti-Libanus, and took the  name of Durzis, corrupted into Druses.            As the khalif vanished erst,      In what seemed death to uninstructed eyes,      On red Mokattam's verge.        Robert Browning, _The Return of the Druses_, i.      =Molay= (_Jacques_), grand-master of the Knights Templar, as he was led to  the stake, summoned the pope (Clement V.), within forty days, and the  king (Philippe IV.), within forty weeks, to appear before the throne of  God to answer for his death. They both died within the stated periods.  (See SUMMONS TO DEATH.)      =Moli[`e]re= (_The Italian_), Charlo Goldoni (1707-1793).    _Moli[`e]re_ (_The Spanish_), Leandro Fernandez Moratin (1760-1828).      =Moll Cutpurse=, Mary Frith, who once attacked General Fairfax on  Hounslow Heath.      =Moll Flanders=, a woman of great beauty, born in the Old Bailey. She was  twelve years a courtezan, five years a wife, twelve years a thief, eight  years a convict in Virginia; but ultimately grew rich, and died a  penitent in the reign of Charles II.    [Asterism] Daniel Defoe wrote her life and adventures, which he called  _The Fortunes of Moll Flanders_ (1722).      =Molly=, Jaggers's housekeeper. A mysterious, scared-looking woman, with a  deep scar across one of her wrists. Her antecedents were full of  mystery, and Pip suspected her of being Estella's mother.--C. Dickens,  _Great Expectations_ (1860).      =Molly Maggs=, a pert young housemaid, in love with Robin. She hates  Polyglot, the tutor of \"Master Charles,\" but is very fond of Charles.  Molly tries to get \"the tuterer Polypot\" into a scrape, but finds, to  her consternation, that Master Charles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#18)"],[1,"gives me a great respect  for my bread and meat. I want to taste of as many viands as possible;  for when I sit down to a dish of porridge I am certain of rising again  a better animal, and I may rise a wiser man. I want to eat and drink  and be instructed. Some day I expect to extract from my pudding the  flavor of manna which I ate in the desert, and then I shall write you  a contemporaneous commentary on the Exodus. Nor do I despair of  remembering yet, over a dish of corn, the time when I fed on worms;  and then I may be able to recall how it felt to be made at last into a  man. Give me to eat and drink, for I crave wisdom.           *       *       *       *       *    My winters, while I was a very little girl, were passed in comparative  confinement. On account of my delicate health, my grandmother and  aunts deemed it wise to keep me indoors; or if I went out, I was so  heavily coated and mittened and shawled that the frost scarcely got a  chance at the tip of my nose. I never skated or coasted or built snow  houses. If I had any experience of snowballs, it was with those  thrown at me by the Gentile boys. The way I dodge a snowball to this  day makes me certain that I learned the act in my fearful childhood  days, when I learned so many cowardly tricks of bending to a blow. I  know that I was proud of myself when, not many years ago, I found I  was not afraid to stand up and catch a flying baseball; but the fear  of the snowball I have not conquered. When I turn a corner in snowball  days, the boys with bulging pockets see a head held high and a step  unquickened, but I know that I cringe inwardly; and this private  mortification I set down against old Polotzk, in my long score of  grievances and shames. Fear is a devil hard to cast out.    Let me make the most of the winter adventures that I recall. First,  there was sleighing. We never kept horses of our own, but the horses  of our customer-guests were always at our disposal, and many a jolly  ride they gave us, with the dvornik at the reins, while their owners  haggled with my mother in the store about the price of soap. We had no  luxurious sleigh, with cushions and fur robes, no silver bells on our  harness. Ours was a bare sledge used for hauling wood, with a padding  of straw and burlap, and the reins, as likely as not, were a knotted  rope. But the horses did fly, over the river and up the opposite bank  if we chose; and whether we had bells or not, the merry, foolish heart  of Yakub would sing, and the whip would crack, and we children would  laugh; and the sport was as good as when, occasionally, we did ride in  a more splendid sleigh, loaned us by one of our prouder guests. We  were wholesome as apples to look at when we returned for bread and tea  in the dusk; at least I remember my sister, with cheeks as red as a  painted doll's under her close-clipped curls; and my little brother,  rosy, too, and aristocratic-looking enough, in his little greatcoat  tied with a red sash, and little fur cap with earlaps. For myself, I  suppose my nose was purple and my cheeks pinched, just as they are now  in the cold weather; but I had a good time.    At certain--I mean uncertain--intervals we were bundled up and marched  to the public baths. This was so great an undertaking, consuming half  a day or so, and involving, in winter, such risk of catching cold,  that it is no wonder the ceremony was not practised oftener.    The public baths were situated on the river bank. I always stopped  awhile outside, to visit the poor patient horse in the treadmill, by  means of which the water was pumped into the baths. I was not  sentimental about animals then. I had not read of \"Black Beauty\" or  any other personified monsters; I had not heard of any societies for  the prevention of cruelty to anything. But my pity stirred of its own  accord at the sight of that miserable brute in the treadmill. I was  used to seeing horses hard-worked and abused. This horse had no load  to make him sweat, and I never saw him whipped. Yet I pitied this  creature. Round and round his little circle he trod, with head hanging  and eyes void of expectation; round and round all day, unthrilled by  any touch of rein or bridle, interpreters of a living will; round and  round, all solitary, never driven, never checked, never addressed;  round and round and round, a walking machine, with eyes that did not  flash, with teeth that did not threaten, with hoofs that did not  strike; round and round the dull day long. I knew what a horse's life  should be, entangled with the life of a master: adventurous, troubled,  thrilled; petted and opposed, loved and abused; to-day the ringing  city pavement underfoot, and the buzz of beasts and men in the market  place; to-morrow the yielding turf under tickled flanks, and the lone  whinny of scattered mates. How empty the existence of the treadmill  horse beside this! As empty and endless and dull as the life of almost  any woman in Polotzk, had I had eyes to see the likeness.    But to my ablutions!    We undress in a room leading directly from the entry, and furnished  only with benches around the walls. There is no screen or other  protection against the drafts rushing in every time the door is  opened. When we enter the bathing-room we are confused by a babel of  sounds--shrill voices of women, hoarse voices of attendants, wailing  and yelping of children, and rushing of water. At the same time we are  smitten by the heat of the room and nearly suffocated by clouds of  steam. We find at last an empty bench, and surround ourselves with a  semicircle of wooden pails, collected from all around the room.  Sometimes two women in search of pails lay hold of the same pail at  the same moment, and a wrangle ensues, in the course of which each  disputant reminds the other of all her failings, nicknames, and  undesirable connections, living, dead, and unborn; until an attendant  interferes, with more muscle than argument, punctuating the sentence  of justice with newly coined expletives suggested by the occasion. The  centre of the room, where the bathers fill their pails at the faucets,  is a field of endless battle, especially on a crowded day. The  peaceful women seated within earshot stop their violent scrubbing, to  the relief of unwilling children, while they attend to the liveliest  of the quarrels.    I like to watch the _poll_, that place of torture and heroic  endurance. It is a series of steps rising to the ceiling, affording a  gradually mounting temperature. The bather who wants to enjoy a  violent sweating rests full length for a few minutes on each step,  while an attendant administers several hearty strokes of a stinging  besom. Sometimes a woman climbs too far, and is brought down in a  faint. On the poll, also, the cupping is done. The back of the  patient, with the cups in even rows, looks to me like a muffin pan. Of  course I never go on the poll: I am not robust enough. My spankings I  take at home.    Another centre of interest is the _mikweh_, the name of which it is  indelicate to mention in the hearing of men. It is a large pool of  standing water, its depth graded by means of a flight of steps. Every  married woman must perform here certain ceremonious ablutions at  regular intervals. Cleanliness is as strictly enjoined as godliness,  and the manner of attaining it is carefully prescribed. The women are  prepared by the attendants for entering the pool, the curious children  looking on. In the pool they are ducked over their heads the correct  number of times. The water in the pool has been standing for days; it  does not look nor smell fresh. But we had no germs in Polotzk, so no  harm came of it, any more than of the pails used promiscuously by  feminine Polotzk. If any were so dainty as to have second thoughts  about the use of the common bath, they could enjoy, for a fee of  twenty-five kopecks, a private bathtub in another part of the  building. For the rich there were luxuries even in Polotzk.    Cleansed, red-skinned, and steaming, we return at last to the  dressing-room, to shiver, as we dress, in the cold drafts from the  entry door; and then, muffled up to the eyes, we plunge into the  refreshing outer air, and hurry home, looking like so many big bundles  running away with smaller bundles. If we meet acquaintances on the way  we are greeted with \"_zu refueh_\" (\"to your good health\"). If the  first man we meet is a Gentile, the women who have been to the mikweh  have to return and repeat the ceremony of purification. To prevent  such a calamity, the kerchief is worn hooded over the eyes, so as to  exclude unholy sights. At home we are indulged with extra pieces of  cake for tea, and otherwise treated like heroes returned from victory.  We narrate anecdotes of our expedition, and my mother complains that  my little brother is getting too old to be taken to the women's bath.  He will go hereafter with the men.        [Illustration: THE MEAT MARKET, POLOTZK]    My winter confinement was not shared by my older sister, who otherwise  was my constant companion. She went out more than I, not being so  afraid of the cold. She used to fret so when my mother was away in the  store that it became a custom for her to accompany my mother from the  time she was a mere baby. Muffled and rosy and frost-bitten, the tears  of cold rolling unnoticed down her plump cheeks, she ran after my busy  mother all day long, or tumbled about behind the counter, or nestled  for a nap among the bulging sacks of oats and barley. She warmed her  little hands over my mother's pot of glowing charcoal--there was no  stove in the store--and even learned to stand astride of it, for  further comfort, without setting her clothes on fire.    Fetchke was like a young colt inseparable from the mare. I make this  comparison not in disrespectful jest, but in deepest pity. Fetchke  kept close to my mother at first for love and protection, but the  petting she got "]]]
