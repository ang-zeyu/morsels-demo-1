(#18)"],[1,"method is suitable for heavy work, where the timbers are  of considerable size. The halvings are cut on the ends of the segments  to any convenient shape or bevel, each one being marked so as to fit its  fellow.    [Illustration: Fig. 341.--Part of Laminated Table Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 342.--Half of Laminated Core Box.]    When extra length is required, semicircular or circular work is built up  out of four or five thicknesses of wood, and the method is called  laminating. The method of building up the semicircular head of a door  frame by this method is shown at Figs. 339 and 340.    The shaped framing for kidney-shaped writing tables and similar classes  of work is built up by laminating pieces of 3/4-in. or 1-in. wood, after  which the face side is veneered so as to hide the glued joints. Fig. 341  shows a sketch of one quarter of an elliptical table frame levelled up  and ready for applying the veneer.    LAMINATION.--If we apply to the dictionary for the word \"lamination,\" we  find that lamellar structure is the arrangements in thin plates or layers  one over the other, usually having the end joints alternating, and it is  a condition which allows of cleavage in one direction only. This method  is used for nearly all descriptions of free or irregular curves, such as  sweeps, bends, ogee shapes, and segments of circles. The timber is marked  out in suitable lengths, rough-sawn and then planed true on the face,  glued together, and when set the sides are cleaned up to the required  shape. It is one of the strongest methods of construction, and  necessarily costly. Pulleys, pulley rims, and a hundred and one other  jobs are built by this method.    Fig. 342 shows one half of a core box built by this method, ready to be  worked to the required shape.          MISCELLANEOUS JOINTS      Weather boards.--For outdoor buildings, such as garages, garden sheds,  toolhouses, etc., \"weatherboarding\" is often preferred to ordinary  matchboarding, chiefly because of the facility with which it throws off  the rain. The boarding can be bought ready prepared. Three methods of  jointing are shown in the sections at Fig. 343. The method indicated at A  shows one of the most satisfactory types, its boards being planed and  moulded as shown. The other two examples are more common. The boarding at  B is rebated, whilst at C each board overhangs its lower neighbour. The  boards for C and D are always cut tapered as indicated.    [Illustration: Fig. 343.--Weather Boards.]    [Illustration: Fig. 344.--Ladder Rungs.]    The end grain is usually protected by nailing on a strip of timber,  chamfered on both edges.    LADDERS.--Fig. 344 illustrates the method of fastening the rung (or  stave) of a ladder to the side. At A the common method is shown, the  stave being simply driven into the hole and wedged. At B a much better  but more expensive method of construction is given. The stave here is  socketed and the pin turned to a smaller diameter. In both cases the  rung, or stave, is painted before being driven into the side and wedged.    [Illustration: Fig. 345.--Cornice Pole Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 346.--Veneer Keying.]    Ladder sides are made in two distinct ways. One method is known as \"a  plank side,\" the side being cut from a plank as shown at the section D;  the other method is called \"a pole side,\" and is constructed by cutting a  straight larch pole in half and using half of the pole for each side of  the ladder, as at section C.    HINGED CORNICE POLES.--Fig. 345 shows a hinged joint for cornice poles  and should be of interest to those who are frequently removing from house  to house. The joint will adapt itself to fit any bay window (even a  square bay) and it is formed by turning and cutting the two pieces shown.  To fix a cornice pole to a bay window one of these joints is required for  each angle of the bay, the pole being cut into suitable lengths and fixed  to the hinged joints by the use of the dowel screw and a little hot  glue. It is perhaps needless to remark that the diameter of the joint  should be of the same diameter as the cornice pole, to enable the rings  to easily slide over the surface.    For fastening a turned ornament (or \"finial\") to the end of a cornice  pole a double pointed screw (known in the trade as a \"dowel screw\") is  used, one half of which is screwed into each part of the pieces to be  joined.    VENEER KEYING.--Fig. 346 illustrates the method of strengthening the  corners of boxes which are made of 1/4-in. or 3/8-in. timber, by securing  the corners with veneer keys. The box is mitred and glued in the usual  manner, and after allowing sufficient time for the glue to set, saw kerfs  are made as shown at _a a_. A piece of thin saw-cut veneer is afterwards  glued into the saw kerfs, and when dry the face is levelled off flush.  This method is often used previous to veneering the face side of the box  with rare veneers, and it is also useful for repair work. Note that the  saw cuts are made at an angle. Small picture frames are sometimes keyed  instead of nailed.    MUNTIN AND SKIRTING JOINT.--In the case of panelled rooms it is usually  necessary to scribe the muntins (or uprights) to the skirting. The method  is shown in Fig. 347. The bead moulding of the skirting is only partly  removed, as indicated, leaving a solid portion to which the muntin is  skew-nailed.    COT JOINT.--At Fig. 348 is shown an interesting joint used largely in the  making of Indian cots. The illustrations indicate how the cross bar and  end bar are mortised into the leg. A turned hardwood peg fits into a  suitably provided hole and locks the tenons, which are dry jointed (not  glued) in position. The head of this peg forms an ornament (A) at the  top of the leg and should fit tightly in position. At B are seen the end  and cross bars in their relative positions when apart from the leg. C  shows the end bar and cross bar when the cot is fixed, but in this  illustration the leg is purposely left out of the drawing for a clear  representation. D shows the joints of the leg portion when the part of  the leg above the line at A is sawn off. The hardwood peg is shown at E.    [Illustration: Fig. 347.--Fixing Muntin to Skirting.]    [Illustration: Fig. 348.--Joint for Home-made Cot.]    SIDEBOARD PILLARS, ETC. (Fig. 349).--For economy, sideboard pillars are  sometimes built up as indicated, the \"shaft,\" the \"base,\" and the \"swell\"  being made up of three distinct pieces. Turned pins are left on the shaft  and the base, and these are secured at the joint by the use of a  double-pointed screw called a dowel screw. This does away with the  necessity of reducing the squares at the top of the wood and thus getting  the turning out of a large piece of wood.    NOTCHED JOINTS.--Fig. 350 is a \"notched joint,\" where two joists, or  scantlings, cross each other, the object of the joint being to prevent  the joists moving from their position without materially weakening them.  For an end notch, see Fig. 352.    [Illustration: Fig. 349.--Method of Building up Turnings.]    [Illustration: Fig. 350.--Notched Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 351.--The Saddle Joint.]    The \"saddle joint\" (Fig. 351) is used for connecting upright posts to  heads or sills of framing, and undoubtedly takes its name from its  similarity to the way in which the saddle fits the horse. It does not  weaken the framing as does a mortise and tenon joint, and shrinkage has  little effect upon the joint. The \"cogged joint,\" used for connecting  purlins to rafter and joists to girders, is illustrated in Fig. 353.    [Illustration: Fig. 352.--End Notch.]    [Illustration: Fig. 353.--Cogged Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 354.--Birdsmouth Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 355.--Another type of Birdsmouth Joint.]    BIRDSMOUTH JOINTS.--Fig. 354 is a \"birdsmouth joint,\" a simple joint  which can be readily made by the handsaw, used when a spar fits on the  wall plate. A nail is shown securing it in position.    Fig. 355 shows the birdsmouth joint where the spar runs over the  _outside_ of the wall plate, thus allowing a fixing for an ornamental  finish.    [Illustration: Fig. 356.--Rafter and Tie Beam Joint.]    RAFTER JOINT.--Fig. 356 shows an everyday joint, as used at the juncture  of the principal rafter and the tie-beam in roof truss work. A sketch of  piece A is shown separated, and it should be noted that the depth of the  cut portion B should not be more than one-fourth of the total width of  the tie-beam.    [Illustration: Fig. 357.--Method of Pelleting the Corner of a Mitred  Picture Frame.]    PELLETING.--Fig. 357 indicates the method of pelleting and screwing the  corner of a picture frame. The mitre joint is first screwed and a pellet  of the same timber is made to fill the hole which has been bored to  receive the screw head. The pellet is glued in position and levelled off.    [Illustration: Fig. 358.--Patera Covers to Hide Screws.]    PATERA COVERS.--In cases where the style of ornament permits of it,  patera covers are used instead of pelleting. Fig. 358 shows the jointing  of shaped spandrails, etc., to carcase ends of light portable cabinet  work, etc. A hole is bored about 3/8 in. deep into the end, and a screw  is used to hold the shaping in position. After fixing the rail a small  turned button, called a turned patera, is inserted in the hole, thus  giving an ornamental finish, as shown in the front view. The turned  patera is driven fairly tightly into the hole, but not glued. When it is  required to take the article apart a chisel is carefully inserted under  the edge of the patera to remove it, and the screw can then be taken out.  This method is often used for the construction of light hanging bookcases  and similar objects. For a bookcase having an end 8 ins. wide three of  these turned buttons and three screws would be used to secure the shelf  to the end. Pateras in different styles may be purchased from any dealer  in woodworking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#18)"],[1,"folds,  one two-thirds from the top and a small fold near the bottom to preserve  the outline.    If too short pin the pattern on the material, cut around the top of  gore and on each side two-thirds of the distance from the top of gore.  Unpin and draw the pattern down to the bottom and cut the required  length. Except for wash material, do not turn a gored skirt up at the  bottom to form a wide hem, as the fullness made by turning is hard to  dispose of neatly and the right curve at the bottom of the skirt may be  lost.    Another way to lengthen the pattern is to cut it in two, two-thirds the  distance from the top. See that all pleats or tucks are exactly the same  width and at the exact distance from the top or bottom of the gore, also  that all seams are of the right length. A shorter skirt must be  proportionately narrower.    [Sidenote: Testing Patterns]    It is well to test the skirt and waist patterns by using inexpensive  materials, such as calico, gingham, or cheap lining. Cut, baste, fit,  and make this as carefully as if it were the best cloth or silk. If the  skirt and waist are satisfactory, the pattern will do duty for several  seasons. The plain waist pattern is the foundation for _any_ waist and  many changes can be made easily with a well-fitting skirt and plain  waist pattern as a basis.    [Sidenote: Cloth Patterns]    As paper patterns soon wear out, after a waist and skirt have been  perfectly fitted, it is a good plan to cut an exact pattern of cambric,  both skirt and waist, tracing seams and notching the parts. This will  enable the home dressmaker to cut and make all ordinary dresses with  little trouble and with but one trying on. It is always well to try on  once, as materials differ in texture and a slight change may be  necessary.      [Illustration: PLACING PATTERNS    At the left, on plain or symmetrical designs; at the right, on figured  or napped goods. _a_--Half of front gore; _b_--Second gore; _c_--Third  gore; _d_--Back gore; _e_--Front waist; _f_--Under arm piece; _g_--Side  back; _h_--Back; _i_--Outside sleeve; _j_--Under sleeve; _c'  d'_--Piecing of gores _c, d_.]      [Sidenote: Placing Patterns]    If the material is plain, has no nap, or if the design is perfectly  symmetrical, the gores may be alternated, the top of one gore coming  opposite the bottom of the next. The half pattern of the front gore is  always laid on a _lengthwise fold_ of the goods. If the goods is wide,  the other gores may be cut double with the cloth folded lengthwise. With  narrow goods, the cloth may be folded end to end after the middle gore  has been cut out, and the other gores cut double. Care should be taken  that the line of holes in the middle of the gores runs exactly in a line  with the warp of the material, i. e., parallel to the selvage.    If the goods has a figure, the design should run upwards. Any nap should  run downward, except with velvet or velveteen, in which it should run  upwards. With such goods, the gores if cut double must be placed on a  lengthwise fold, with the lengths running the same way. If the goods is  narrow, the gores may have to be cut single, reversing the pattern  (turning it over) so that both pieces may not be for the same side.    [Sidenote: Pinning Patterns]    Pin the middle of the pattern to the goods and smooth towards each end,  pinning securely at top and bottom. Avoid too many pins and pin  carefully, otherwise the pattern will be displaced.    [Sidenote: Cutting Out]    After the pattern is securely pinned, cut out the gores, using long,  sharp shears. Care should be taken not to lift the material from the  table, not to have jagged, uneven edges, as both time and material will  be wasted in straightening them. Open the shears as wide as possible,  taking a long sweep of the material, and do not allow the points of the  shears to come together. Mark all notches with basting thread, tailor's  chalk, or notch the goods if it does not ravel.    The back gores should be cut in the same way. They are usually wider  than the front gores and may require piecing, which should be done along  the warp threads.    Now remove the pattern, pin carefully all pieces together and fold as  little as possible. The trinity--_pin_, _baste_, _press_--should be  written in large letters in every sewing room, for much of the beauty of  the gown depends upon these three.    [Sidenote: Joining the Skirt]    To join the skirt, pin the side gores to the front gores, beginning at  the top, with pins running across the seams, then begin at the top of  the skirt and baste downward, allowing all unevenness to come out at the  bottom. Baste straight and evenly, taking one stitch at a time. Several  stitches should never be taken at once on thick or piled goods, as the  side next to the sewer is apt to be fuller in that case. When all seams  are basted, try on the skirt and make all changes necessary before  stitching. Both the outside skirt and any under or \"drop\" skirt should  be fitted as carefully as a waist.    [Sidenote: Lined Skirt]    If the skirt is to be lined the lining should be made and fitted first,  then ripped and the outside carefully basted on the lining, being well  stretched over the lining, care being taken to have the warp of the  outside and the lining run the same way. This will prevent the lining  from drawing the goods.    [Sidenote: Stitching Skirts]    A stitch of medium length should be used on all seams whether white  goods or cloth. If the stitch is too long, the seam will \"gap\" and will  show the thread; if too short, the seam is apt to draw. The line of  stitching must be absolutely parallel inside or outside of the basting  or the curve will be ruined. Use silk or the best cotton for stitching  skirts and be sure that the needle is not too coarse.    [Sidenote: Finishing Seams]    After stitching, all bastings along the seams should be taken out by  cutting the thread in several places. Never pull a basting the length of  the skirt. The seams should be opened and pressed according to  directions. The seams may be finished with a taffeta binding, overcast,  stitched flat or notched, as the case demands.    [Sidenote: Stiffening]    If stiffening is used at the bottom of a lined skirt it should be fitted  to each lining gore separately and securely stitched. A light weight  canvas should be stitched to a heavy cloth skirt at the bottom, if  several rows of stitching or braid are to finish the bottom of the  skirt.    [Sidenote: Placket]    The placket may be finished before the two back gores are pinned to the  front, if preferred. If done before joining the gores the placket can be  pressed better and the front is not so liable to be crushed. On the left  side of the skirt sew an underlap of sufficient length to extend well  below the end of the opening. Face the right side of the opening with a  piece of the goods, or tape not too wide, hem or cat-stitch to the  skirt, and finish with hooks and eyes, loops, or any fastening that will  secure the placket.    [Sidenote: Putting on Band]    The skirt is now ready for the band, which should be narrow. Always cut  parallel with the selvage and the length of the underlap longer than the  waist measure, allowing for turning at the ends. The band should never  be thick and clumsy and not too tight. Try on the skirt and fit the band  carefully, marking the seam with pins, a line of basting, or chalk. Hold  the skirt easy on the band and baste with small stitches, then stitch on  the machine. If the skirt is too tight around the hips the plaits will  fall apart at the back. If the skirt is stretched on the band the seams  will not fall in a straight line. After the band is securely stitched  and finished with hooks and eyes adjust the length by turning under at  the bottom and pinning, after which baste all around and try on again to  make sure that the length is correct.    [Sidenote: Finishing the Bottom]    A gored outside garment should be finished with a true bias or a fitted  facing, carefully stitched on. It is possible to finish the bottom of a  simple house dress or thin skirt with a hem if the fullness made by  turning is disposed of in gathers or fine pleats. A bias facing,  however, is always preferable. If of heavy or lined goods the finish  should be velveteen or braid the same color as the skirt. These bindings  come in different widths and grades. Braids should always be shrunken by  wetting and drying thoroughly; one wetting is not enough. Velveteen  should be applied loosely, so as not to shrink or draw after it becomes  damp on the skirt.    [Sidenote: Applying Velveteen Binding]    The right side of the velveteen should be carefully basted with small,  even stitches to the edge of the facing. It may be hemmed to the facing  or machine stitched just inside the basting, which need not be removed.  It is then turned, allowing a very narrow portion to show below the  edge, and basted with close stitches, pressed, hemmed down to the facing  by hand, or cat stitched without turning the edge. Be careful not to let  the stitches show on the right side, nor let the binding twist or  pucker. The joining of the velveteen should be near the seam in the  back.    Another method is to cut off the bottom edge of the skirt a quarter of  an inch from the turning line; apply the wrong side of the velveteen to  the right side of the skirt, baste carefully close to the edge and  stitch on the machine through velveteen, cloth, and lining (or facing)  just inside the basting which is left in. The bottom of the raw edge is  turned up, basted close to the edge allowing the velveteen to show a  very little. The upper edge of the velveteen is secured as before by  turning and hemming or catstitched without turning. The illustration  shows this method of applying the velveteen which is first stitched to  the lining and turned with the edge. This makes a firm, rather stiff  finish.    [Sidenote: Braid]   "]]]
