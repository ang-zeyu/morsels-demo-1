[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#18)"],[1,"Association, in the magnificent old park of the War Department in the  heart of Berlin, Prince and Princess William were present. The  Princess walked up and down, chatting now with one lady, now with  another, in attire so simple that the plainest there could feel no  unpleasant contrast, and in manner so beautiful and genial that we  could forget the princess in admiration of the unassuming lady.           *       *       *       *       *    Of the Empress Frederick much has been said, and much invented, since  the days when she left England, a bride of seventeen, to make her  home in a foreign land.    \"Is the Crown Princess popular?\" I said to a young German lady, in the  early days of our residence in Berlin.    \"Not very.\"    \"She is strong-minded, is she not?\"    \"Yes, too strong,\" replied the lady.    Perhaps the Crown Princess Victoria did not sufficiently disguise the  broad difference between her birthright as the heir of the thought and  feeling of her distinguished father, \"Prince Albert the Good,\" and the  low plane still habitual to many German women. She has always been an  Englishwoman; and this was the chief charge I ever heard against her,  in my endeavor to reach the real statement of the case. And yet all  agree that she has been devoted to the best interests of the German  people. Everywhere in humane, benevolent, and educational work, we  found the impress of her guiding hand. A German lady, of rare ability,  sweetness, and culture, was one day giving me the pathetic story of  her hopes and efforts for the elevation and education of her  country-women. In the course of the conversation she was led to quote  a remark made to her by the Crown Princess: \"You must _form the  character_ of the German women, before you can do much to elevate  them.\" Is not this in keeping with the profound practical wisdom  which, notwithstanding the puerilities and small femininities which  abound in some of the published writings of England's royal family,  makes their pages still worth the reading, and lets us into the secret  of the true womanliness which, despite all blemishes and foibles,  Victoria, Empress Queen of England, has instilled into the mind of her  daughter Victoria, Empress Dowager of Germany. There is hope for  womankind, when \"the fierce light which beats upon a throne\" shows  naught to mar the purity of the home-life which has adorned the  palaces and the courts of Germany and of England, so far as these have  been under the influence of the two Victorias.           *       *       *       *       *    \"When you say 'Germany,'\" said our \"little Fraeulein\" to us one day,  \"nobody is afraid; when you say 'Bismarck,' everybody trembles.\"  Reports about the ill health of the Iron Chancellor were, two or three  years ago, possibly exaggerated, but doubtless they had some  foundation in fact. Previous to the great debate on the Army Bill, it  had been said that his physical health was a mere wreck. No sign of  this appeared, however, when we saw the great Diplomatist in his seat  in the Reichstag on that memorable occasion. His speech, though  occasional cadences lapsed into indistinctness in that hall of poor  acoustic properties, was in the main easily heard in all parts of the  house. The yellow military collar of his dark blue coat showed his  pallid face not to advantage, but that fierce look was unsubdued, the  broad brow loomed above eyes before which one instinctively quails,  and the pose and movements were those of vigorous health. Every  afternoon in the ensuing spring, his stout square-shouldered figure  might be seen, in military uniform and with sword rattling in its  scabbard, accompanied by a single aid, on horseback, trotting through  the shaded riding-paths of the Thiergarten,--for the sake of health,  doubtless, but evidently with no little pleasure. On his birthday in  April he received, at his palace in the Wilhelm Strasse, the greetings  of his regiment, to whom he distributed wine and cake and mementos,  and also saw many other friends. At his country-seats in Pomerania and  Lauensburg most of his time is spent, divided between the cares of  State and the enjoyments of a rustic life. On the occasion referred to  in the Parliament, speaking of the Army Bill which the Opposition  professed a willingness to grant for three years but not for seven, he  said, \"Three years hence, I may hope to be here; in seven, I shall be  above all this misery.\" The three years have not yet passed. For the  glory of Germany, many will hope that twice seven may find the name of  Bismarck still inspiring with dread the enemies of his country.           *       *       *       *       *    General Von Moltke, the Grant of Germany, might often be seen, by  those who knew when and where to look for him, in plain dress, walking  along Unter den Linden, or through the city edge of the Thiergarten,  near the building of the General Staff, of which he was long the Chief  and where he lives. This most eminent student of the art of war lives  a seemingly lonely life since the death of his wife, whose portrait is  said to be the chief adornment of his private room. He is fond of  music, and an open piano is his close companion in hours of leisure.  His plain carriage is seen but seldom by sojourners in Berlin. His  words need not to be many to be weighty, and his influence was great  with Emperor William I. and Crown Prince Frederick, whose tutor he had  been. No scene after the death of Frederick III. was more affecting  than Von Moltke in tears over his bier. \"Never before,\" said an  officer who had long known the great general, \"have I seen Von Moltke  so broken up.\"           *       *       *       *       *    General Von Waldersee has, by the recent retirement of Von Moltke,  become Chief of the German Army Staff. The Countess Von Waldersee,  closely related by her first marriage to the present Empress, is a  devout Christian lady, an American by birth, and has much influence in  the German Court. Her most romantic history is known to many since,  the daughter of a wealthy New York merchant, she went abroad some  twenty-five years ago, met and married a wealthy Schleswig-Holstein  baron, by which marriage she became related to more than one royal  house in Europe; was soon left a youthful widow with great wealth, and  after a few years, in which she maintained the estate and title of an  Austrian Princess also bequeathed her by her first husband, married  the German nobleman who is now the head of the German army. She is  devoted to her home, her husband and children, and to quiet ways of  doing good. Her dazzling history is her least claim on the interest of  American women. A noble character, devoted consistently in her high  station to the service of God and to even the humblest good of her  fellow-creatures, gives regal lustre to her name, which is a synonym  for goodness to all who know her.            VIII.    THE NINETIETH BIRTHDAY OF EMPEROR WILLIAM.      To those who are fond of pageants and who linger lovingly with past  ages, such a spectacle as Berlin witnessed on the 22d of March, 1887,  must have extraordinary attractions. Never in the long life of the  aged Emperor, whose ninetieth birthday it was, had there been in  splendor a rival to that day, although his whole career was prolific  of great scenes and dramatic situations. Eighty-five royal personages  had accepted the invitation to visit the Emperor on that occasion; and  they came in person, or sent special envoys, each accompanied by a  more or less imposing retinue. As guests of the Imperial family, they  were lodged in the various palaces of Berlin and Potsdam, and  entertained with most thoughtful and sumptuous hospitality. The  arrivals began on Friday, March 18, and continued through the three  following days, until the list included the Prince of Wales; the Crown  Prince of Austria; the Grand Duke and Duchess Vladimir and the Grand  Duke Michel of Russia; the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden; the  King and Queen of Roumania; the King and Queen of Saxony; the Prince  and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; the Grand Duke of Hesse  and his daughter the Princess Irene; the Grand Duchess of Baden; the  Duke of Saxe-Meiningen; the Hereditary Prince and Princess of  Mecklenburg-Strelitz; the Duke of Waldeck-Pyrmont, father of the Queen  of the Netherlands and the Duchess of Albany; the Dowager Grand  Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the Grand Duchess Marie, and a host  of other royal notables. Costly presents and beautiful flowers had  been pouring in to the Emperor for days before, from the members of  his own large family, the various diplomatic corps, from royal  friends, from learned societies, industrial and philanthropic  associations, with gifts from China, Turkey, and other distant  countries. Many of the presents were arranged in a room in the  Kaiser's palace, the centre-piece being a portrait of his favorite and  eldest great-grandson painted by the Crown Princess, and surrounded by  an elegant display of flowers. This palace was reserved for the calls  of the distinguished guests, and for a State dinner of a hundred  covers, given to the visiting royalties on the eve of the birthday by  the Emperor and Empress. The palace of the Crown Prince was decorated  about the entrance with palms and other exotics. Here the Crown  Princess entertained the Prince of Wales and the Princess Christian  with her family,--three children of Queen Victoria under the same  roof. The Grand Duchess of Baden, only daughter of the Emperor, was  entertained in the Dutch Palace, connected with the Emperor's by a  corridor. One of those dramatic touches in real life of which Emperor  William was fond, was the betrothal of the Princess Irene, daughter of  the Grand Duke of Hesse and the late Princess Alice of England, to her  cousin Prince Henry, second son of the Crown Prince. It was announced  by the Emperor on his birthday,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#18)"],[1,"'s not a thing she's  likely to do twice! I should think she'd be frightened to go anywhere  near a river again just yet. Are those clothes dry? Well, never mind,  pack them as they are; we can't wait for them. And the rug, too, just  bundle it up and put it at the bottom of the car. Johnson can brush it  to-morrow. He's a fine chap. I shall write to the 'Humane Society'  about this business. They ought to give him a medal.\"    \"I've tried to thank him,\" said Carmel, \"but directly I begin he dives  away and does something at the car. He doesn't seem to want to be  thanked.\"    \"Oh, that's just Johnson's usual way!\" drawled Sheila. \"I expect he's  pleased all the same. You look a little more respectable now, Carmel. I  shouldn't have liked to take you into the Hill Crest Hotel as you were  an hour ago! I expect after this stoppage we shall arrive too late to  dress comfortably for dinner, unless Johnson literally tears along, and  then I'm scared out of my wits! What a life! I'd never go motoring for  choice! It's not my idea of a holiday, I must say.\"    After all, though Johnson seldom exceeded the speed limit, the Rogers  arrived at Tivermouth in ample time for Sheila to don a fascinating  evening costume, and to arrange her fair hair in an elaborate coiffure.  The hotel was full of summer visitors, and in her opinion the large  dining-room with its Moorish decorations, the numerous daintily-spread  little tables, and the fashionable well-dressed crowd who flocked in at  the sounding of a gong were far more entertaining than a wood and a  picnic meal. But Sheila was not fond of \"rabbit\" holidays.    [Illustration: JOHNSON THE CHAUFFEUR SHOT DOWN THROUGH THE WOOD]    \"It beats those old-fashioned places we stayed at in the country towns,  doesn't it?\" she said to Carmel, as they sat in the lounge, waiting for  Major and Mrs. Rogers to come down stairs. \"By the by, are your cousins  here? I looked in the visitors' book and couldn't find their names. What  has happened to them?\"    \"A letter from Dulcie was waiting for me,\" explained Carmel. \"They  couldn't get rooms here. They were writing to the 'Eagle's Nest Hotel,'  and hoped to get taken in there. I don't know whether they've arrived or  not. Dulcie didn't say exactly which day they were starting. It's just  like Dulcie! She generally misses out the most important point!\"    \"Well, I suppose they'll look you up when they do arrive,\" said Sheila  carelessly. \"Anyway, I bless them for giving us some sort of an anchor  down here. I feel I'm going to enjoy myself. I asked the manageress, and  she says there's to be a dance to-night after dinner.\"    Carmel, sitting on a cane chair in the palm lounge next morning, agreed  with Sheila that Hill Crest Hotel was a remarkably comfortable and  luxurious place. A fountain was splashing near her, foreign birds sang  and twittered in the aviary, and large pots of geraniums made bright  patches of color under the green of the palms. Pleasant though it was,  however, it lacked the charm of the open air, and, throwing down the  magazine she was reading, Carmel strolled through the hall and the glass  veranda on to the terrace outside. The hotel certainly had a most  beautiful situation. As its name implied, it stood on the crest of a  hill, surrounded by woods and grounds that stretched to the beach. A  little noisy Devonshire river raced past it through the glen, and behind  it lay the heathery waste of a great moorland. Below lay the gleaming  waters of the bay, with small boats bobbing about, and a distant view of  the crags and headlands of a rugged coast line. The terrace was planted  with a border of trailing pink ivy-leaved geraniums, and the bank that  sloped below was a superb mass of hydrangeas in full bloom, their  delicate shades of blue and pink looking like the hues of dawn in a  clear sky.    Carmel established herself on a seat to enjoy the prospect, and picking  up a gray Persian cat which was also sunning itself on the terrace,  fondled the pretty creature in her arms. She was seeing England to the  best advantage, for nowhere could there have been a lovelier scene than  the one which lay before her delighted eyes. Tivermouth had a reputation  as a beauty spot, and owing to its long distance from the railway was as  yet unspoilt by a too great invasion of tourists. There were other  hotels nestling among the greenery of the woods, and Carmel wondered if  the Ingletons had arrived at one of them, and at which of the white  houses on the beach the boys were staying with Miss Mason.    As she was still gazing and speculating there was a crunch of footsteps  on the gravel behind, a voice called her name, and looking round she saw  Cousin Clare, Lilias, and Dulcie, hurrying towards her. There was an  enthusiastic greeting, followed by explanations from all three.    \"We'd the greatest difficulty to get rooms!\"    \"The whole place seems full up!\"    \"They couldn't take us at the 'Eagle's Nest.'\"    \"We've got in at the 'Victoria,' though!\"    \"I wish we could have been here with you!\"    \"Never mind, so long as we're at Tivermouth at all!\"    \"Isn't it just too gorgeous for words!\"    \"We only arrived late last night.\"    \"There's such heaps we want to tell you!\"    There was indeed much to be told on both sides. All three girls had had  numerous experiences during the short time of their parting, and they  were anxious to compare notes. Then Cousin Clare, Lilias, and Dulcie  must be introduced to the Rogers family, who were all writing letters in  a private sitting-room, but stopped their correspondence to extend a  hearty welcome and to chat with the new-comers. In a short time the  party rearranged itself, leaving Cousin Clare to talk with Major and  Mrs. Rogers, Lilias and Dulcie arm-in-arm with Carmel on the terrace,  and Sheila, who had stepped with them out at the French window, straying  away with a young Highland officer with whom she had danced the night  before.    \"Never mind Sheila--she doesn't want _us_!\" laughed Carmel, squeezing  both her cousins' arms, for she was in the middle. \"Oh, it's nice to see  you again! Let's walk along here to the end of the terrace. I've had all  sorts of adventures since I saw you. I was nearly drowned yesterday in a  river, only Johnson, the chauffeur, fished me out. You should have seen  me all dripping and covered with mud. And Johnson was just as bad. We  made such a mess of the car with our muddy clothes. I wonder if he's got  it clean yet? By the by, I left my post cards in the side pocket. I'd  love to show them to you. Shall we go and get them? The garage is quite  close, only just down this path. Do you mind coming?\"    \"Go ahead; we'd like to,\" agreed Dulcie.    So they plunged down the hill-side on a twisting path, past the bank of  hydrangeas and through a grove of shiny-leaved escallonias to where the  garage, a large building with a corrugated-iron roof, stood on a natural  platform of rock close to the steep high road that flanked the hotel.  The yard was full of visitors' cars in process of being cleaned, and  chauffeurs were busy with hose, or polishing fittings.    \"I wonder where Johnson has put ours?\" said Carmel, threading her way  between an enormous Daimler and a pretty little two-seater. \"Oh, there  it is! That dark-green one in the corner. Come along! There's just room  to pass here behind this coupe. I expect the post cards are all right.  Johnson would take care of them for me. I'll ask him to get them.  Johnson!\"    The chauffeur, who was bending over the car, too busy with wrench and  screwdriver to notice their approach, straightened himself instantly,  and glanced at the three girls. As his eyes fell on Lilias and Dulcie,  his expression changed to one of utter consternation and amazement, and  he colored to the roots of his fair hair. They on their part gazed at  him as if they had encountered a specter.    \"Everard!\" gasped Dulcie.    \"Everard!\" faltered Lilias. \"It's never _you_!\"    Here indeed was a drama. Four more astonished young people it would have  been impossible to conceive. For a moment Everard seemed as if he were  going to bolt, but Carmel, whose quick mind instantly grasped the  situation, motioned him into the empty motor-shed behind, and,  following with Lilias and Dulcie, partly closed the door.    \"So you're Everard, are you?\" she said, looking at him hard. \"Well, to  tell you the truth, I never thought your name was really Johnson! I told  Sheila I was sure you were a gentleman. Why have you been masquerading  like this? Why don't you go home to the Chase?\"    \"Oh, _do_ come home, Everard!\" echoed Lilias entreatingly.    The ex-chauffeur shook his head. He was still almost too covered with  confusion to admit of speech.    \"I didn't expect to meet you girls,\" he said at last. \"The best thing  you can do is just to forget me, and leave me where I am. I shall  _never_ go back to the Chase! That point I've quite decided.\"    \"But we want you there,\" said Carmel gently.    \"You!\" Everard looked frankly puzzled.    \"Oh, Everard!\" burst out Dulcie. \"You don't understand! You ran away and  never waited to hear anything, and we couldn't write to you, because you  sent no address. You thought Grandfather had left the property to a boy  cousin--Leslie!\"    \"Well, didn't he?\"    \"Yes, and no! There is no boy cousin. This is Leslie--only she's called  Carmel--the heiress of Cheverley Chase!\"    \"You!\" exclaimed Everard again, gazing at Carmel.    \"Don't call me 'the heiress,' Dulcie,\" protested Carmel. \"You know I've  said from the very first that I don't intend to take the Chase away from  you all. It's yours every bit as much as mine, and more so, because my  own real home is in Sicily, and I hope to go back there some day.  Everard, will you make friends with me on that understanding, and shake  hands? I don't want to turn anybody out of the Chase.\"    Carmel held out a slim little hand, and Everard accepted it"]]]
