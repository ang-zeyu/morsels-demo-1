As he felt the growing danger approach, he remembered  those towns of secondary grade--Uru, Uruk, Larsam, and Eridu--all  of which, lying outside Nebuchadrezzar's scheme of defence, would be  sacrificed in the case of an invasion: he had therefore brought away  from them the most venerated statues, those in which the spirit of the  divinity was more particularly pleased to dwell, and had shut them up in  the capital, within the security of its triple rampart.**         * This seems to follow from the part which he plays in the       final crisis, as told in the _Cylinder of Cyrus_ and in the       _Annals_.         ** The chronicler adds that the gods of Sippar, Kutha, and       Borsippa were not taken to Babylon; and indeed, these cities       being included within the lines of defence of the great       city, their gods were as well defended from the enemy as if       they had been in Babylon itself.    This attempt to concentrate the divine powers, accentuating as it did  the supremacy of Bel-Marduk over his compeers, was doubtless flattering  to his pride and that of his priests, but was ill received by the rest  of the sacerdotal class and by the populace. All these divine guests had  not only to be lodged, but required to be watched over, decked, fed, and  feted, together with their respective temple retinues; and the prestige  and honour of the local Bel, as well as his revenues, were likely to  suffer in consequence. The clamour of the gods in the celestial heights  soon re-echoed throughout the land; the divinities complained of their  sojourn at Babylon as of a captivity in E-sagilla; they lamented over  the suppression of their daily sacrifices, and Marduk at length took  pity on them. He looked upon the countries of Sumir and Akkad, and saw  their sanctuaries in ruins and their towns lifeless as corpses; \"he cast  his eyes over the surrounding regions; he searched them with his glance  and sought out a prince, upright, after his own heart, who should take  his hands. He proclaimed by name Cyrus, King of Anshan, and he called  him by his name to universal sovereignty.\" Alike for the people  of Babylon and for the exiled Jew, and also doubtless for other  stranger-colonies, Cyrus appeared as a deliverer chosen by the gods;  his speedy approach was everywhere expected, if not with the same  impatience, at least with an almost joyful resignation. His plans were  carried into action in the early months of 538, and his habitual good  fortune did not forsake him at this decisive moment of his career. The  immense citadel raised by Nebuchadrezzar in the midst of his empire, in  anticipation of an attack by the Medes, was as yet intact, and the walls  rising one behind another, the moats, and the canals and marshes which  protected it, had been so well kept up or restored since his time, that  their security was absolutely complete; a besieging army could do little  harm--it needed a whole nation in revolt to compass its downfall. A  whole nation also was required for its defence, but the Babylonians  were not inclined to second the efforts of their sovereign. Nabonidus  concentrated his troops at the point most threatened, in the angle  comprised near Opis between the Medic wall and the bend of the Tigris,  and waited in inaction the commencement of the attack. It is supposed  that Cyrus put two bodies of troops in motion: one leaving Susa under  his own command, took the usual route of all Blamite invasions in the  direction of the confluence of the Tigris and the Diyala; the other  commanded by Gobryas, the satrap of Gutium, followed the course of  the Adhem or the Diyala, and brought the northern contingents to the  rallying-place. From what we know of the facts as a whole, it would  appear that the besieging force chose the neighbourhood of the present  Bagdad to make a breach in the fortifications. Taking advantage of the  months when the rivers were at their lowest, they drew off the water  from the Diyala and the Tigris till they so reduced the level that they  were able to cross on foot; they then cut their way through the ramparts  on the left bank, and rapidly transported the bulk of their forces  into the very centre of the enemy's position. The principal body of the  Chaldaean troops were still at Opis, cut off from the capital; Cyrus  fell upon them, overcame them on the banks of the Zalzallat in the early  days of Tammuz, urging forward Gobryas meanwhile upon Babylon itself.*  On the 14th of Tammuz, Nabonidus evacuated Sippar, which at once fell  into the hands of the Persian outposts; on the 16th Gobryas entered  Babylon without striking a blow, and Nabonidus surrendered himself a  prisoner.**         * For the strategic interpretation of the events of this       campaign I have generally adopted the explanations of       Billerbeck. Herodotus' account with regard to the river       Gyndes is probably a reminiscence of alterations made in the       river-courses at the time of the attack in the direction of       Bagdad.         ** The _Cylinder of Cyrus_, 1. 17, expressly says so:       \"Without combat or battle did Marduk make him enter       Babylon,\" The _Annals of Nabonidus_ confirm this testimony       of the official account.    The victorious army had received orders to avoid all excesses which  would offend the people; they respected the property of the citizens and  of the temples, placed a strong detachment around E-sagilla to protect  it from plunder, and no armed soldier was allowed within the enclosure  until the king' had determined on the fate of the vanquished. Cyrus  arrived after a fortnight had elapsed, on the 3rd of March-esvan, and  his first act was one of clemency. He prohibited all pillage, granted  mercy to the inhabitants, and entrusted the government of the city to  Gobryas. Bel-sharuzur, the son of Nabonidus, remained to be dealt  with, and his energetic nature might have been the cause of serious  difficulties had he been allowed an opportunity of rallying the last  partisans of the dynasty around him. Gobryas set out to attack him, and  on the 11th of March-esvan succeeded in surprising and slaying him. With  him perished the last hope of the Chaldaeans, and the nobles and towns,  still hesitating on what course to pursue, now vied with each other in  their haste to tender submission. The means of securing their good  will, at all events for the moment, was clearly at hand, and it was used  without any delay: their gods were at once restored to them. This exodus  extended over nearly two months, during March-esvan and Adar, and on  its termination a proclamation of six days of mourning, up to the 3rd of  Nisan, was made for the death of Bel-sharuzur, and as an atonement for  the faults of Nabonidus, after which, on the 4th of Nisan, the notables  of the city were called together in the temple of Nebo to join in the  last expiatory ceremonies. Cyrus did not hesitate for a moment to act  as Tiglath-pileser III. and most of the Sargonids had done; he \"took the  hands of Bel,\" and proclaimed himself king of the country, but in order  to secure the succession, he associated his son Cambyses with himself  as King of Babylon. Mesopotamia having been restored to order, the  provinces in their turn transferred their allegiance to Persia; \"the  kings enthroned in their palaces, from the Upper Sea to the Lower, those  of Syria and those who dwell in tents, brought their weighty tribute to  Babylon and kissed the feet of the suzerain.\" Events had followed one  another so quickly, and had entailed so little bloodshed, that popular  imagination was quite disconcerted: it could not conceive that an  empire of such an extent and of so formidable an appearance should have  succumbed almost without a battle, and three generations had not elapsed  before an entire cycle of legends had gathered round the catastrophe.  They related how Cyrus, having set out to make war, with provisions of  all kinds for his household, and especially with his usual stores of  water from the river Choaspes, the only kind of which he deigned to  drink, had reached the banks of the Gyndes. While seeking for a ford,  one of the white horses consecrated to the sun sprang into the river,  and being overturned by the current, was drowned before it could  be rescued. Cyrus regarded this accident as a personal affront, and  interrupted his expedition to avenge it. He employed his army during one  entire summer in digging three hundred and sixty canals, and thus caused  the principal arm of the stream to run dry, and he did not resume his  march upon Babylon till the following spring, when the level of the  water was low enough to permit of a woman crossing from one bank to the  other without wetting her knees. The Babylonians at first attempted  to prevent the blockade of the place, but being repulsed in their  _sorties_, they retired within the walls, much to Cyrus's annoyance, for  they were provisioned for several years. He therefore undertook to  turn the course of the Euphrates into the Bahr-i-Nejif, and having  accomplished it, he crept into the centre of the city by the dry bed of  the river. If the Babylonians had kept proper guard, the Persians would  probably have been surrounded and caught like fish in a net; but on that  particular day they were keeping one of their festivals, and continued  their dancing and singing till they suddenly found the streets alive  with the enemy.    Babylon suffered in no way by her servitude, and far from its being a  source of unhappiness to her, she actually rejoiced in it; she was rid  of Nabonidus, whose sacrilegious innovations had scandalised her piety,  and she possessed in Cyrus a legitimate sovereign since he had \"taken  the hands of Bel.\" It pleased her to believe that she had conquered her  victor rather than been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#18)"],[1," has reached our time is his treatise  on elocution; and the careful thought which he there gives to the  choice of words and to the form of a sentence, and even the parts of a  sentence, shows the value then set upon style. Indeed he seems rather  to have charmed his hearers by the softness of his words than to have  roused them to noble deeds by the strength of his thoughts. He not only  advised Ptolemy Soter what books he should buy, but which he should  read, and he chiefly recommended those on government and policy; and  it is alike to the credit of the king and of the librarian, that he  put before him books which, from their praise of freedom and hatred of  tyrants, few persons would even speak of in the presence of a king.  But Demetrius had also been consulted by Soter about the choice of a  successor, and had given his opinion that the crown ought to be left  to his eldest son, and that wars would arise between his children if  it were not so left; hence we can hardly wonder that, on the death of  Soter, Demetrius should have lost his place at the head of the museum,  and been ordered to leave Alexandria. He died, as courtiers say, in  disgrace; and he was buried near Diospolis in the Busirite nome of the  Delta. According to one account he was put to death by the bite of  an asp, in obedience to the new king's orders, but this story is not  generally credited; although this was not an uncommon way of inflicting  death.    [Illustration: 118.jpg ANUBIS, GOD OF THE LOWER WORLD]    Soon after this we find Zenodotus of Ephesus filling the office of  librarian to the museum. He was a poet, who, with others, had been  employed by Soter in the education of his children. He is also known as  the first of those Alexandrian critics who turned their thoughts towards  mending the text of Homer, and to whom we are indebted for the tolerably  correct state of the great poet's works, which had become faulty through  the carelessness of the copiers. Zenodotus was soon followed by other  critics in this task of editing Homer. But their labours were not  approved of by all; and when Aratus asked Timon which he thought the  best edition of the poet, the philosopher shrewdly answered, \"That which  has been least corrected.\"    At the head of the mathematical school was Euclid; who is, however,  less known to us by what his pupils have said of him than by his own  invaluable work on geometry. This is one of the few of the scientific  writings of the ancients that are still in use. The discoveries of the  man of science are made use of by his successor, and the discoverer  perhaps loses part of his reward when his writings are passed by, after  they have served us as a stepping-stone to mount by. If he wishes his  works to live with those of the poet and orator, he must, like them,  cultivate those beauties of style which are fitted to his matter. Euclid  did so; and his Elements have been for more than two thousand years the  model for all writers on geometry. He begins at the beginning, and  leads the learner, step by step, from the simplest propositions, called  axioms, which rest upon metaphysical rather than mathematical proof, to  high geometrical truths. The mind is indeed sometimes wearied by being  made to stop at every single step in the path, and wishes, with Ptolemy  Soter, for a shorter road; but, upon the whole, Euclid's clearness has  never been equalled.    Ctesibus wrote on the theory of hydrostatics, and was the inventor of  several water-engines; an application of mathematics which was much  called for by the artificial irrigation of Egypt. He also invented that  useful instrument, the water-clock, to tell the time after sunset.    [Illustration: 120.jpg AT THE HEAD OF THE RED SEA]    Among the best known of the men of letters who came to Alexandria to  enjoy the patronage of Philadelphus was Theocritus. Many of his poems  are lost; but his pastoral poems, though too rough for the polished  taste of Quintilian, and perhaps more like nature than we wish any works  of imitative art to be, have always been looked upon as the model of  that kind of poetry. If his shepherds do not speak the language of  courtiers, they have at least a rustic propriety which makes us admire  the manners and thoughts of the peasant. He repaid the bounty of the  king in the way most agreeable to him; he speaks of him as one                                  to freemen kind,       Wise, fond of books and love, of generous mind;       Knows well his friend, but better knows his foe;       Scatters his wealth; when asked he ne'er says No,       But gives as kings should give.       Idyll, xiv. 60.    Theocritus boasted that he would in an undying poem place him in the  rank of the demigods; and, writing with the pyramids and the Memnonium  before his eyes, assured him that generosity towards the poets would  do more to make his name live for ever than any building that he could  raise.    In a back street of Alexandria, in the part of the city named Eleusinis,  near the temple of Ceres and Proserpine, lived the poet Callimachus,  earning his livelihood by teaching. But the writer of the Hymns could  not long dwell so near the court of Philadelphus unknown and unhonoured.  He was made professor of poetry in the museum, and even now repays  the king and patron for what he then received. He was a man of great  industry, and wrote in prose and in all kinds of verse; but of these  only a few hymns and epigrams have come down to our time. Egypt seems to  have been the birthplace of the mournful elegy, and Callimachus was the  chief of the elegiac poets. He was born at Cyrene; and though, from the  language in which he wrote, his thoughts are mostly Greek, yet he did  not forget the place of his birth. He calls upon Apollo by the name of  Carneus, because, after Sparta and Thera, Cyrene was his chosen seat.  He paints Latona, weary and in pain in the island of Delos, as leaning  against a palm-tree, by the side of the river Inopus, which, sinking  into the ground, was to rise again in Egypt, near the cataracts of  Syene; and, prettily pointing to Philadelphus, he makes Apollo, yet  unborn, ask his mother not to give birth to him in the island of Cos,  because that island was already chosen as the birthplace of another god,  the child of the gods Soteres, who would be the copy of his father,  and under whose diadem both Egypt and the islands would be proud to be  governed by a Macedonian.    [Illustration: 123.jpg THE CARARACT ON THE ASWAN]    The poet Philastas, who had been the first tutor of Philadelphus, was  in elegy second only to Callimachus; but Quintilian (while advising us  about books, to read much but not many) does not rank him among the  few first-rate poets by whom the student should form his taste; and his  works are now lost. He was small and thin in person, and it was jokingly  said of him that he wore leaden soles to his shoes lest he should be  blown away by the wind. But in losing his poetry, we have perhaps lost  the point of the joke. While these three, Theocritus, Callimachus, and  Philastas, were writing in Alexandria, the museum was certainly the  chief seat of the muses. Athens itself could boast of no such poet  but Menander, with whom Attic literature ended; and him Philadelphus  earnestly invited to his court. He sent a ship to Greece on purpose to  fetch him; but neither this honour nor the promised salary could make  him quit his mother country and the schools of Athens; and, in the time  of Pausanias, his tomb was still visited by the scholar on the road to  the Pmeus, and his statue was still seen in the theatre.    Strato, the pupil of Theophrastus, though chiefly known for his writings  on physics, was also a writer on many branches of knowledge. He was  one of the men of learning who had taken part in the education of  Phil-adelphus; and the king showed his gratitude to his teacher by  making him a present of eighty talents, or sixty thousand dollars. He  was for eighteen years at the head of one of the Alexandrian schools.    Timocharis, the astronomer, made some of his observations at Alexandria  in the last reign, and continued them through half of this reign. He  began a catalogue of the fixed stars, with their latitudes and their  longitudes measured from the equinoctial point; by the help of which  Hipparchus, one hundred and fifty years afterwards, made the great  discovery that the equinoctial point had moved. He has left an  observation of the place of Venus, on the seventeenth day of the month  of Mesore, in the thirteenth year of this reign, which by the modern  tables of the planets is known to have been on the eighth day  of October, B.C. 272; from which we learn that the first year of  Philadelphus ended in October, B.C. 284, and the first year of Ptolemy  Soter ended in October, B.C. 322; thus fixing the chronology of  these reigns with a certainty which leaves nothing to be wished for.  Aris-tillus also made some observations of the same kind at Alexandria.  Few of them have been handed down to us, but they were made use of by  Hipparchus.    Aristarchus, the astronomer of Samos, most likely came to Alexandria  in the last reign, as some of his observations were made in the very  beginning of the reign of Philadelphus. He is the first astronomer who  is known to have taken the true view of the solar system. He said that  the sun was the centre round which the earth moved in a circle; and, as  if he had foreseen that even in after ages we should hardly be able to  measure the distance of the fixed stars, he said that the earth's yearly  path bore no greater proportion to the hollow globe of the heavens in  which the stars were set, than the point without size in the centre of a  circle does to its circumference. But the work in which he proved these  great truths, or perhaps threw out these happy guesses, is lost; and the  astronomers who followed him clung to the old belief that the"]]]
