Nevertheless party spirit still ran high at Athens.  Cimon and Alcmaeon  were violent opponents of Themistocles, and of their party Aristides  was still the head.  The popularity of Aristides was never greater than  at the present time, owing not only to the more liberal spirit which he  exhibited, but also to his great services in establishing the  Confederacy of Delos.  Themistocles had offended the Athenians by his  ostentation and vanity.  He was continually boasting of his services to  the state; but worse than all this, his conduct was stained with  positive guilt.  Whilst, at the head of an Athenian squadron, he was  sailing among the Greek islands for the ostensible purpose of executing  justice, there is little room to doubt that he corrupted its very  source by accepting large sums of money from the cities which he  visited.  Party spirit at length reached such a height that it was  found necessary to resort to ostracism, and Themistocles was condemned  to a temporary banishment (B.C. 471).  He retired to Argos, where he  was residing when the Spartans called upon the Athenians to prosecute  their great statesman before a synod of the allies assembled at Sparta,  on the ground of treasonable correspondence with Persia.  Accordingly  joint envoys were sent from Athens and Sparta to arrest him (B.C. 466).  Themistocles avoided the impending danger by flying from Argos to  Corcyra. The Corcyraeans, however, not daring to shelter him, he passed  over to the continent; where, being still pursued, he was forced to  seek refuge at the court of Admetus, king of the Molossians, though the  latter was his personal enemy.  Fortunately, Admetus happened to be  from home.  The forlorn condition of Themistocles excited the  compassion of the wife of the Molossian king, who placed her child in  his arms, and bade him seat himself on the hearth as a suppliant.  As  soon as the king arrived, Themistocles explained his peril, and adjured  him by the sacred laws of hospitality not to take vengeance upon a  fallen foe.  Admetus accepted his appeal, and raised him from the  hearth; he refused to deliver him up to his pursuers, and at last only  dismissed him on his own expressed desire to proceed to Persia.  After  many perils, Themistocles succeeded in reaching in safety the coast of  Asia.  Artaxerxes, the son of Xerxes, was now upon the throne of  Persia, and to him Themistocles hastened to announce himself. The king  was delighted at his arrival, and treated him with the greatest  distinction.  In a year's time, Themistocles, having acquired a  sufficient knowledge of the Persian language to be able to converse in  it, entertained Artaxerxes with magnificent schemes for the subjugation  of Greece.  Artaxerxes loaded him with presents, gave him a Persian  wife, and appointed Magnesia, a town not far from the Ionian coast, as  his place of residence. After living there some time he was carried off  by disease at the age of sixty-five, without having realised, or  apparently attempted, any of those plans with which he had dazzled the  Persian monarch.  Rumour ascribed his death to poison, which he took of  his own accord, from a consciousness of his inability to perform his  promises; but this report, which was current in the time of Thucydides,  is rejected by that historian.    Aristides died about four years after the banishment of Themistocles.  The common accounts of his poverty are probably exaggerated, and seem  to have been founded on the circumstances of a public funeral, and of  handsome donations made to his three children by the state.  But  whatever his property may have been, it is at least certain that he did  not acquire or increase it by unlawful means; and not even calumny has  ventured to assail his well-earned title of THE JUST.    On the death of Aristides, Cimon became the undisputed leader of the  conservative party at Athens.  Cimon was generous, affable,  magnificent; and, notwithstanding his political views, of exceedingly  popular manners.  He had inherited the military genius of his father,  and was undoubtedly the greatest commander of his time.  He employed  the vast wealth acquired in his expeditions in adorning Athens and  gratifying his fellow-citizens. It has been already mentioned that he  succeeded Aristides in the command of the allied fleet.  His first  exploits were the capture of Eion on the Strymon, and the reduction of  the island of Scyros (B.C. 476).  A few years afterwards we find the  first symptoms of discontent among the members of the Confederacy of  Delos.  Naxos, one of the confederate islands, and the largest of the  Cyclades, revolted in B.C. 466, probably from a feeling of the growing  oppressiveness of the Athenian headship.  It was immediately invested  by the confederate fleet, reduced, and made tributary to Athens.  This  was another step towards dominion gained by the Athenians, whose  pretensions were assisted by the imprudence of the allies.  Many of the  smaller states belonging to the confederacy, wearied with perpetual  hostilities, commuted for a money payment the ships which they were  bound to supply; and thus, by depriving themselves of a navy, lost the  only means by which they could assert their independence.    The same year was marked by a memorable action against the Persians.  Cimon at the head of 200 Athenian triremes, and 100 furnished by the  allies, proceeded to the coast of Asia Minor. The Persians had  assembled a large fleet and army at the mouth of the river Eurymedon in  Pamphylia.  After speedily defeating the fleet, Cimon landed his men  and marched against the Persian army which was drawn up on the shore to  protect the fleet.  The land-force fought with bravery, but was at  length put to the rout.    The island of Thasos was the next member of the confederacy against  which the Athenians directed their arms.  After a siege of more than  two years that island surrendered, when its fortifications were razed,  and it was condemned to pay tribute (B.C. 463).    The expedition to Thasos was attended with a circumstance which first  gives token of the coming hostilities between Sparta and Athens.  At an  early period of the blockade the Thasians secretly applied to the  Lacedaemonians to make a diversion in their favour by invading Attica:  and though the Lacedaemonians were still ostensibly allied with Athens,  they were base enough to comply with this request.  Their treachery,  however, was prevented by a terrible calamity which befel themselves.  In the year B.C. 461 their capital was visited by an earthquake which  laid it in ruins and killed 20,000 of the citizens.  But this was only  part of the calamity.  The earthquake was immediately followed by a  revolt of the Helots, who were always ready to avail themselves of the  weakness of their tyrants.  Being joined by the Messenians, they  fortified themselves in Mount Ithome in Messenia.  Hence this revolt is  sometimes called the Third Messenian War (B.C. 464). after two or three  years spent in a vain attempt to dislodge them from this position, the  Lacedaemonians found themselves obliged to call in the assistance of  their allies, and, among the rest, of the Athenians.  It was with great  difficulty that Cimon persuaded the Athenians to comply with this  request; but he was at length despatched to Laconia with a force of  4000 hoplites. The aid of the Athenians had been requested by the  Lacedaemonians on account of their acknowledged superiority in the art  of attacking fortified places.  As, however, Cimon did not succeed in  dislodging the Helots from Ithome the Lacedaemonians, probably from a  consciousness of their own treachery in the affair of Thasos, suspected  that the Athenians were playing them false, and abruptly dismissed  them, saying that they had no longer any occasion for their services.  This rude dismissal gave great offence at Athens, and annihilated for a  time the political influence of Cimon.  The democratical party had from  the first opposed the expedition; and it afforded them a great triumph  to be able to point to Cimon returning not only unsuccessful but  insulted.  That party was now led by Pericles.  A sort of hereditary  feud existed between Pericles and Cimon; for it was Xanthippus, the  father of Pericles, who had impeached Miltiades, the father of Cimon.  The character of Pericles was almost the reverse of Cimon's.  Although  the leader of the popular party, his manners were reserved.  He  appeared but little in society, and only in public upon great  occasions.  His mind had received the highest polish which that period  was capable of giving.  He constantly conversed with Anaxagoras,  Protagoras, Zeno, and other eminent philosophers.  To oratory in  particular he had devoted much attention, as an indispensable  instrument for swaying the public assemblies of Athens.    Pericles seized the occasion presented by the ill success of Cimon,  both to ruin that leader and to strike a fatal blow at the  aristocratical party.  He deprived the Areopagus of its chief  functions, and left it a mere shadow of its former influence and power.  He rendered the election to magistracies dependent simply upon lot, so  that every citizen however poor, had an equal chance of obtaining the  honours of the state.  Other changes which accompanied this  revolution--for such it must be called--were the institution of paid  DICASTERIES or jury-courts, and the almost entire abrogation of the  judicial power of the Senate of Five Hundred.  It cannot be supposed  that such fundamental changes were effected without violent party  strife.  The poet AEschylus, in the tragedy of the EUMENIDIES, in vain  exerted all the powers of his genius in support of the aristocratical  party and of the tottering Areopagus; his exertions on this occasion  resulted only in his own flight from Athens.  The same fate attended  Cimon himself; and he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#18)"],[1," ran up upon the  mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.  The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length  into the sodden soil.  In vain he struggled and writhed.  Not one step  could he possibly take either forwards or backwards.  He yelled in  impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot,  but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky  bank.  When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored  that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that  we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish,  over our side.  The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their  launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded.  The Aurora  herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern.  A solid iron chest  of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck.  This, there could be no  question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of  the Sholtos.  There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so  we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin.  As we steamed  slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction,  but there was no sign of the Islander.  Somewhere in the dark ooze at  the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our  shores.      \"See here,\" said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway.  \"We were  hardly quick enough with our pistols.\"  There, sure enough, just behind  where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we  knew so well.  It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we  fired.  Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy  fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible  death which had passed so close to us that night.        Chapter XI    The Great Agra Treasure    Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done  so much and waited so long to gain.  He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed  fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany  features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular  prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be  easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or  thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray.  His  face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and  aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression  when moved to anger.  He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his  lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen,  twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings.  It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and  contained countenance.  Once he looked up at me with a gleam of  something like humor in his eyes.    \"Well, Jonathan Small,\" said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \"I am sorry that  it has come to this.\"    \"And so am I, sir,\" he answered, frankly.  \"I don't believe that I can  swing over the job.  I give you my word on the book that I never raised  hand against Mr. Sholto.  It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot  one of his cursed darts into him.  I had no part in it, sir.  I was as  grieved as if it had been my blood-relation.  I welted the little devil  with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not  undo it again.\"    \"Have a cigar,\" said Holmes; \"and you had best take a pull out of my  flask, for you are very wet.  How could you expect so small and weak a  man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you  were climbing the rope?\"    \"You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth  is that I hoped to find the room clear.  I knew the habits of the house  pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to  his supper.  I shall make no secret of the business.  The best defence  that I can make is just the simple truth.  Now, if it had been the old  major I would have swung for him with a light heart.  I would have  thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar.  But it's  cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I  had no quarrel whatever.\"    \"You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard.  He  is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true  account of the matter.  You must make a clean breast of it, for if you  do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the  poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached  the room.\"    \"That he was, sir.  I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw  him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through  the window.  It fairly shook me, sir.  I'd have half killed Tonga for  it if he had not scrambled off.  That was how he came to leave his  club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say  helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than  I can tell.  I don't feel no malice against you for it.  But it does  seem a queer thing,\" he added, with a bitter smile, \"that I who have a  fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first  half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to  spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor.  It was an evil day  for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do  with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet  upon the man who owned it.  To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto  it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\"    At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders  into the tiny cabin.  \"Quite a family party,\" he remarked.  \"I think I  shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all  congratulate each other.  Pity we didn't take the other alive; but  there was no choice.  I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it  rather fine.  It was all we could do to overhaul her.\"    \"All is well that ends well,\" said Holmes.  \"But I certainly did not  know that the Aurora was such a clipper.\"    \"Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that  if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never  have caught her.  He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\"    \"Neither he did,\" cried our prisoner,--\"not a word.  I chose his launch  because I heard that she was a flier.  We told him nothing, but we paid  him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our  vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.\"    \"Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him.  If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in  condemning them.\"  It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones  was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the  capture.  From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's  face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.    \"We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\" said Jones, \"and shall land  you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box.  I need hardly tell you that I  am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this.  It is  most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement.  I must,  however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you  have so valuable a charge.  You will drive, no doubt?\"    \"Yes, I shall drive.\"    \"It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first.  You will have to break it open.  Where is the key, my man?\"    \"At the bottom of the river,\" said Small, shortly.    \"Hum!  There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble.  We have  had work enough already through you.  However, doctor, I need not warn  you to be careful.  Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street  rooms.  You will find us there, on our way to the station.\"    They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,  genial inspector as my companion.  A quarter of an hour's drive brought  us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's.  The servant seemed surprised at so late  a visitor.  Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she  explained, and likely to be very late.  Miss Morstan, however, was in  the drawing-room:  so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving  the obliging inspector in the cab.    She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white  diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and  waist.  The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned  back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and  tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant  hair.  One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and  her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy.  At the  sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright  flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.    \"I heard a cab drive up,\" she said.  \"I thought that Mrs. Forrester had  come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you.  What  news have you brought me?\"    \"I have brought something better than news,\" said I, putting down the  box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my  heart was heavy within me.  \"I have brought you something which is  worth all the news in the world.  I have brought you a fortune.\"    She glanced at the iron box.  \"Is that the treasure, then?\" she asked,  coolly enough.    \"Yes, this is the great Agra treasure.  Half of it is yours and half is  Thaddeus Sholto's.  You will have a couple of hundred thousand each.  Think of that!  An annuity of ten thousand pounds.  There will be few  richer young ladies in England.  Is it not glorious?\"    I think that I must have been rather"]]]
