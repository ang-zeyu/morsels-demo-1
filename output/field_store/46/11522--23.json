So strong was his dislike that when  he became a young man he ran away to the seacoast, for he had a fancy to  be a sailor. There he found a ship bound for the West Indies, and in  this he started out on his life's career. He had no money to pay his  passage, and he therefore followed the usual custom of those days and  sold himself for a term of three years to an agent who was taking out a  number of men to work on the plantations. In the places where these men  were enlisted they were termed servants, but when they got to the new  world they were generally called slaves and treated as such.    When young Morgan reached the Barbadoes he was resold to a planter, and  during his term of service he probably worked a good deal harder and was  treated much more roughly than any of the laborers on his father's farm.  But as soon as he was a free man he went to Jamaica, and there were few  places in the world where a young man could be more free and more  independent than in this lawless island.    Here were rollicking and blustering \"flibustiers,\" and here the young  man determined to study piracy. He was not a sailor and hunter who by  the force of circumstances gradually became a buccaneer, but he  deliberately selected his profession, and immediately set to work to  acquire a knowledge of its practice. There was a buccaneer ship about to  sail from Jamaica, and on this Morgan enlisted. He was a clever fellow  and very soon showed himself to be a brave and able sailor.    After three or four voyages he acquired a reputation for remarkable  coolness in emergencies, and showed an ability to take advantage of  favorable circumstances, which was not possessed by many of his  comrades. These prominent traits in his character became the foundation  of his success. He also proved himself a very good business man, and  having saved a considerable amount of money he joined with some other  buccaneers and bought a ship, of which he took command. This ship soon  made itself a scourge in the Spanish seas; no other buccaneering vessel  was so widely known and so greatly feared, and the English people in  these regions were as proud of the young Captain Morgan as if he had  been a regularly commissioned admiral, cruising against an acknowledged  enemy.    Returning from one of his voyages Morgan found an old buccaneer, named  Mansvelt, in Jamaica, who had gathered together a fleet of vessels with  which he was about to sail for the mainland. This expedition seemed a  promising one to Morgan, and he joined it, being elected vice-admiral of  the fleet of fifteen vessels. Since the successes of L'Olonnois and  others, attacks upon towns had become very popular with the buccaneers,  whose leaders were getting to be tired of the retail branch of their  business; that is, sailing about in one ship and capturing such  merchantmen as it might fall in with.    Mansvelt's expedition took with it not only six hundred fighting  pirates, but one writing pirate, for John Esquemeling accompanied it,  and so far as the fame and reputation of these adventurers was concerned  his pen was mightier than their swords, for had it not been for his  account of their deeds very little about them would have been known to  the world.    The fleet sailed directly for St. Catherine, an island near Costa Rica,  which was strongly fortified by the Spaniards and used by them as a  station for ammunition and supplies, and also as a prison. The pirates  landed upon the island and made a most furious assault upon the  fortifications, and although they were built of stone and well furnished  with cannon, the savage assailants met with their usual good fortune.  They swarmed over the walls and carried the place at the edge of the  cutlass and the mouth of the pistol. In this fierce fight Morgan  performed such feats of valor that even some of the Spaniards who had  been taken prisoners, were forced to praise his extraordinary courage  and ability as a leader.    The buccaneers proceeded to make very good use of their victory. They  captured some small adjoining islands and brought the cannon from them  to the main fortress, which they put in a good condition of defence.  Here they confined all their prisoners and slaves, and supplied the  island with an abundance of stores and provisions.    It is believed that when Mansvelt formed the plan of capturing this  island he did so with the idea of founding there a permanent pirate  principality, the inhabitants of which should not consider themselves  English, French, or Dutch, but plain pirates, having a nationality and  country of their own. Had the seed thus planted by Mansvelt and Morgan  grown and matured, it is not unlikely that the whole of the West Indies  might now be owned and inhabited by an independent nation, whose  founders were the bold buccaneers.    When everything had been made tight and right at St. Catherine, Mansvelt  and Morgan sailed for the mainland, for the purpose of attacking an  inland town called Nata, but in this expedition they were not  successful. The Spanish Governor of the province had heard of their  approach, and met them with a body of soldiers so large that they  prudently gave up the attempt,--a proceeding not very common with them,  but Morgan was not only a dare-devil of a pirate, but a very shrewd  Welshman.    They returned to the ships, and after touching at St. Catherine and  leaving there enough men to defend it, under the command of a Frenchman  named Le Sieur Simon, they sailed for Jamaica. Everything at St.  Catherine was arranged for permanent occupation; there was plenty of  fresh water, and the ground could be cultivated, and Simon was promised  that additional forces should be sent him so that he could hold the  island as a regular station for the assembling and fitting out of pirate  vessels.    The permanent pirate colony never came to anything; no reenforcements  were sent; Mansvelt died, and the Spaniards gathered together a  sufficient force to retake the island of St. Catherine, and make  prisoners of Simon and his men. This was a blow to Morgan, who had had  great hopes of the fortified station he thought he had so firmly  established, but after the project failed he set about forming another  expedition.    He was now recognized as buccaneer-in-chief of the West Indies, and he  very soon gathered together twelve ships and seven hundred men.  Everything was made ready to sail, and the only thing left to be done  was to decide what particular place they should favor with a visit.    There were some who advised an attack upon Havana, giving as a reason  that in that city there were a great many nuns, monks, and priests, and  if they could capture them, they might ask as ransom for them, a sum a  great deal larger than they could expect to get from the pillage of an  ordinary town. But Havana was considered to be too strong a place for a  profitable venture, and after several suggestions had been made, at last  a deserter from the Spanish army, who had joined them, came forward with  a good idea. He told the pirates of a town in Cuba, to which he knew the  way; it was named Port-au-Prince, and was situated so far inland that it  had never been sacked. When the pirates heard that there existed an  entirely fresh and unpillaged town, they were filled with as much  excited delight as if they had been a party of school-boys who had just  been told where they might find a tree full of ripe apples which had  been overlooked by the men who had been gathering the crop.    When Morgan's fleet arrived at the nearest harbor to Port-au-Prince, he  landed his men and marched toward the town, but he did not succeed in  making a secret attack, as he had hoped. One of his prisoners, a  Spaniard, let himself drop overboard as soon as the vessels cast anchor,  and swimming ashore, hurried to Port-au-Prince and informed the Governor  of the attack which was about to be made on the town. Thus prepared,  this able commander knew just what to do. He marched a body of soldiers  along the road by which the pirates must come, and when he found a  suitable spot he caused great trees to be cut down and laid across the  road, thus making a formidable barricade. Behind this his soldiers were  posted with their muskets and their cannon, and when the pirates should  arrive they would find that they would have to do some extraordinary  fighting before they could pass this well-defended barrier.    When Morgan came within sight of this barricade, he understood that the  Spaniards had discovered his approach, and so he called a halt. He had  always been opposed to unnecessary work, and he considered that it would  be entirely unnecessary to attempt to disturb this admirable defence, so  he left the road, marched his men into the woods, led them entirely  around the barricades, and then, after proceeding a considerable  distance, emerged upon a wide plain which lay before the town. Here he  found that he would have to fight his way into the city, and, probably  much to his surprise, his men were presently charged by a body of  cavalry.    Pirates, as a rule, have nothing to do with horses, either in peace or  war, and the Governor of the town no doubt thought that when his  well-armed horsemen charged upon these men, accustomed to fighting on  the decks of ships, and totally unused to cavalry combats, he would soon  scatter and disperse them. But pirates are peculiar fighters; if they  had been attacked from above by means of balloons, or from below by  mines and explosives, they would doubtless have adapted their style of  defence to the method of attack. They always did this, and according to  Esquemeling they nearly always got the better of their enemies; but we  must remember that in cases where they did not succeed, as happened when  they marched against the town of Nata, he says very little about the  affair"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#18)"],[1,", 20 waiters.  Apply chef's office, 11 P.M. Tuesday.      \"Hum,\" he thought.  \"I suppose, to take the place of those fellows who  are going to sail on the George Washington to cook for Mr. Wilson.  That's a grand ad for the Octagon, having their kitchen staff chosen  for the President's trip.  Gee, I wonder why they don't play that up in  some real space?  Maybe I can place some copy for them along that line.\"    An idea suddenly occurred to him, and he went over to the chair where  he had thrown his overcoat the night before.  From the pocket he took  out the cover of Carlyle's Cromwell, and looked at it carefully.    \"I wonder what the jinx is on this book?\" he thought.  \"It's a queer  thing the way that fellow trailed me last night--then my finding this  in the drug store, and getting that crack on the bean.  I wonder if  that neighbourhood is a safe place for a girl to work in?\"    He paced up and down the room, forgetting the pain in his head.    \"Maybe I ought to tip the police off about this business,\" he thought.  \"It looks wrong to me.  But I have a hankering to work the thing out on  my own.  I'd have a wonderful stand-in with old man Chapman if I saved  that girl from anything. . . . I've heard of gangs of kidnappers. . . .  No, I don't like the looks of things a little bit.  I think that  bookseller is half cracked, anyway.  He doesn't believe in advertising!  The idea of Chapman trusting his daughter in a place like that----\"    The thought of playing knight errant to something more personal and  romantic than an advertising account was irresistible.  \"I'll slip over  to Brooklyn as soon as it gets dark this evening,\" he said to himself.  \"I ought to be able to get a room somewhere along that street, where I  can watch that bookshop without being seen, and find out what's  haunting it.  I've got that old .22 popgun of mine that I used to use  up at camp.  I'll take it along.  I'd like to know more about  Weintraub's drug store, too.  I didn't fancy the map of Herr Weintraub,  not at all.  To tell the truth, I had no idea old man Carlyle would get  mixed up in anything as interesting as this.\"    He found a romantic exhilaration in packing a handbag.  Pyjamas,  hairbrushes, toothbrush, toothpaste--(\"What an ad it would be for the  Chinese Paste people,\" he thought, \"if they knew I was taking a tube of  their stuff on this adventure!\")--his .22 revolver, a small green box  of cartridges of the size commonly used for squirrel-shooting, a volume  of O. Henry, a safety razor and adjuncts, a pad of writing paper. . . .  At least six nationally advertised articles, he said to himself,  enumerating his kit.  He locked his bag, dressed, and went downstairs  for lunch.  After lunch he lay down for a rest, as his head was still  very painful.  But he was not able to sleep.  The thought of Titania  Chapman's blue eyes and gallant little figure came between him and  slumber.  He could not shake off the conviction that some peril was  hanging over her.  Again and again he looked at his watch, rebuking the  lagging dusk.  At half-past four he set off for the subway.  Half-way  down Thirty-third Street a thought struck him.  He returned to his  room, got out a pair of opera glasses from his trunk, and put them in  his bag.    It was blue twilight when he reached Gissing Street.  The block between  Wordsworth Avenue and Hazlitt Street is peculiar in that on one  side--the side where the Haunted Bookshop stands--the old brownstone  dwellings have mostly been replaced by small shops of a bright, lively  character.  At the Wordsworth Avenue corner, where the L swings round  in a lofty roaring curve, stands Weintraub's drug store; below it, on  the western side, a succession of shining windows beacon through the  evening.  Delicatessen shops with their appetizing medley of cooked and  pickled meats, dried fruits, cheeses, and bright coloured jars of  preserves; small modistes with generously contoured wax busts of  coiffured ladies; lunch rooms with the day's menu typed and pasted on  the outer pane; a French rotisserie where chickens turn hissing on the  spits before a tall oven of rosy coals; florists, tobacconists,  fruit-dealers, and a Greek candy-shop with a long soda fountain shining  with onyx marble and coloured glass lamps and nickel tanks of hot  chocolate; a stationery shop, now stuffed for the holiday trade with  Christmas cards, toys, calendars, and those queer little suede-bound  volumes of Kipling, Service, Oscar Wilde, and Omar Khayyam that appear  every year toward Christmas time--such modest and cheerful  merchandising makes the western pavement of Gissing Street a jolly  place when the lights are lit.  All the shops were decorated for the  Christmas trade; the Christmas issues of the magazines were just out  and brightened the newsstands with their glowing covers.  This section  of Brooklyn has a tone and atmosphere peculiarly French in some parts:  one can quite imagine oneself in some smaller Parisian boulevard  frequented by the petit bourgeois.  Midway in this engaging and  animated block stands the Haunted Bookshop.  Aubrey could see its  windows lit, and the shelved masses of books within.  He felt a severe  temptation to enter, but a certain bashfulness added itself to his  desire to act in secret.  There was a privy exhilaration in his plan of  putting the bookshop under an unsuspected surveillance, and he had the  emotion of one walking on the frontiers of adventure.    So he kept on the opposite side of the street, which still maintains an  unbroken row of quiet brown fronts, save for the movie theatre at the  upper corner, opposite Weintraub's.  Some of the basements on this side  are occupied now by small tailors, laundries, and lace-curtain cleaners  (lace curtains are still a fetish in Brooklyn), but most of the houses  are still merely dwellings.  Carrying his bag, Aubrey passed the bright  halo of the movie theatre.  Posters announcing THE RETURN OF TARZAN  showed a kind of third chapter of Genesis scene with an Eve in a sports  suit.  ADDED ATTRACTION, Mr. AND Mrs. SIDNEY DREW, he read.    A little way down the block he saw a sign VACANCIES in a parlour  window.  The house was nearly opposite the bookshop, and he at once  mounted the tall steps to the front door and rang.    A fawn-tinted coloured girl, of the kind generally called \"Addie,\"  arrived presently.  \"Can I get a room here?\" he asked.  \"I don't know,  you'd better see Miz' Schiller,\" she said, without rancour.  Adopting  the customary compromise of untrained domestics, she did not invite him  inside, but departed, leaving the door open to show that there was no  ill will.    Aubrey stepped into the hall and closed the door behind him.  In an  immense mirror the pale cheese-coloured flutter of a gas jet was  remotely reflected.  He noticed the Landseer engraving hung against  wallpaper designed in facsimile of large rectangles of gray stone, and  the usual telephone memorandum for the usual Mrs. J. F. Smith (who  abides in all lodging houses) tucked into the frame of the mirror.  Will Mrs. Smith please call Stockton 6771, it said.  A carpeted stair  with a fine old mahogany balustrade rose into the dimness.  Aubrey, who  was thoroughly familiar with lodgings, knew instinctively that the  fourth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth steps would be creakers.  A soft  musk sweetened the warm, torpid air: he divined that someone was  toasting marshmallows over a gas jet.  He knew perfectly well that  somewhere in the house would be a placard over a bathtub with the  legend:  Please leave this tub as you would wish to find it.  Roger  Mifflin would have said, after studying the hall, that someone in the  house was sure to be reading the poems of Rabbi Tagore; but Aubrey was  not so caustic.    Mrs. Schiller came up the basement stairs, followed by a small pug dog.  She was warm and stout, with a tendency to burst just under the  armpits.  She was friendly.  The pug made merry over Aubrey's ankles.    \"Stop it, Treasure!\" said Mrs. Schiller.    \"Can I get a room here?\" asked Aubrey, with great politeness.    \"Third floor front's the only thing I've got,\" she said.  \"You don't  smoke in bed, do you?  The last young man I had burned holes in three  of my sheets----\"    Aubrey reassured her.    \"I don't give meals.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Aubrey.  \"Suits me.\"    \"Five dollars a week,\" she said.    \"May I see it?\"    Mrs. Schiller brightened the gas and led the way upstairs.  Treasure  skipped up the treads beside her.  The sight of the six feet ascending  together amused Aubrey.  The fourth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth steps  creaked, as he had guessed they would.  On the landing of the second  storey a transom gushed orange light.  Mrs. Schiller was secretly  pleased at not having to augment the gas on that landing.  Under the  transom and behind a door Aubrey could hear someone having a bath, with  a great sloshing of water.  He wondered irreverently whether it was  Mrs. J. F. Smith.  At any rate (he felt sure), it was some experienced  habitue of lodgings, who knew that about five-thirty in the afternoon  is the best time for a bath--before cooking supper and the homecoming  ablutions of other tenants have exhausted the hot water boiler.    They climbed one more flight.  The room was small, occupying half the  third-floor frontage.  A large window opened onto the street, giving a  plain view of the bookshop and the other houses across the way.  A  wash-stand stood modestly inside a large cupboard.  Over the mantel was  the familiar picture--usually, however, reserved for the fourth floor  back--of a young lady having her shoes shined by a ribald small boy.    Aubrey was delighted.  \"This is fine,\" he said.  \"Here's a week in  advance.\"    Mrs. Schiller was almost disconcerted by the rapidity of the  transaction.  She preferred to solemnize the reception of a new lodger  by a little more talk--remarks about the weather, the"]]]
