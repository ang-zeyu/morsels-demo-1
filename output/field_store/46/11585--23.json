He was an unsatisfactory son, and he had been  hurried off to Australia; nor had he been seen since in the village.  Whether there were any more substantial grounds of quarrel between the  two brothers than that the younger one was at home and well-to-do,  while the elder was poor and an exile, was not known, nor, as far as the  inspector could see, was it likely to be known until Mark was captured.    The discovery of Mark was all that mattered immediately. Dragging  the pond might not help towards this, but it would certainly give the  impression in court to-morrow that Inspector Birch was handling the case  with zeal. And if only the revolver with which the deed was done was  brought to the surface, his trouble would be well repaid. \"Inspector  Birch produces the weapon\" would make an excellent headline in the local  paper.    He was feeling well-satisfied with himself, therefore, as he walked to  the pond, where his men were waiting for him, and quite in the mood for  a little pleasant talk with Mr. Gillingham and his friend, Mr. Beverley.  He gave them a cheerful \"Good afternoon,\" and added with a smile,  \"Coming to help us?\"    \"You don't really want us,\" said Antony, smiling back at him.    \"You can come if you like.\"    Antony gave a little shudder.    \"You can tell me afterwards what you find,\" he said. \"By the way,\" he  added, \"I hope the landlord at 'The George' gave me a good character?\"    The Inspector looked at him quickly.    \"Now how on earth do you know anything about that?\"    Antony bowed to him gravely.    \"Because I guessed that you were a very efficient member of the Force.\"    The inspector laughed.    \"Well, you came out all right, Mr. Gillingham. You got a clean bill. But  I had to make certain about you.    \"Of course you did. Well, I wish you luck. But I don't think you'll  find much at the pond. It's rather out of the way, isn't it, for anybody  running away?\"    \"That's just what I told Mr. Cayley, when he called my attention to the  pond. However, we shan't do any harm by looking. It's the unexpected  that's the most likely in this sort of case.\"    \"You're quite right, Inspector. Well, we mustn't keep you. Good  afternoon,\" and Antony smiled pleasantly at him.    \"Good afternoon, sir.\"    \"Good afternoon,\" said Bill.    Antony stood looking after the Inspector as he strode off, silent for  so long that Bill shook him by the arm at last, and asked him rather  crossly what was the matter.    Antony shook his head slowly from side to side.    \"I don't know; really I don't know. It's too devilish what I keep  thinking. He can't be as cold-blooded as that.\"    \"Who?\"    Without answering, Antony led the way back to the garden-seat on which  they had been sitting. He sat there with his head in his hands.    \"Oh, I hope they find something,\" he murmured. \"Oh, I hope they do.\"    \"In the pond?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But what?\"    \"Anything, Bill; anything.\"    Bill was annoyed. \"I say, Tony, this won't do. You really mustn't be so  damn mysterious. What's happened to you suddenly?\"    Antony looked up at him in surprise.    \"Didn't you hear what he said?\"    \"What, particularly?\"    \"That it was Cayley's idea to drag the pond.\"    \"Oh! Oh, I say!\" Bill was rather excited again. \"You mean that he's  hidden something there? Some false clue which he wants the police to  find?\"    \"I hope so,\" said Antony earnestly, \"but I'm afraid--\" He stopped short.    \"Afraid of what?\"    \"Afraid that he hasn't hidden anything there. Afraid that--\"    \"Well?\"    \"What's the safest place in which to hide anything very important?\"    \"Somewhere where nobody will look.\"    \"There's a better place than that.\"    \"What?\"    \"Somewhere where everybody has already looked.\"    \"By Jove! You mean that as soon as the pond has been dragged, Cayley  will hide something there?\"    \"Yes, I'm afraid so.\"    \"But why afraid?\"    \"Because I think that it must be something very important, something  which couldn't easily be hidden anywhere else.\"    \"What?\" asked Bill eagerly.    Antony shook his head.    \"No, I'm not going to talk about it yet. We can wait and see what the  Inspector finds. He may find something--I don't know what--something  that Cayley has put there for him to find. But if he doesn't, then it  will be because Cayley is going to hide something there to-night.\"    \"What?\" asked Bill again.    \"You will see what, Bill,\" said Antony; \"because we shall be there.\"    \"Are we going to watch him?\"    \"Yes, if the Inspector finds nothing.\"    \"That's good,\" said Bill.    If it were a question of Cayley or the Law, he was quite decided as to  which side he was taking. Previous to the tragedy of yesterday he had  got on well enough with both of the cousins, without being in the least  intimate with either. Indeed, of the two he preferred, perhaps, the  silent, solid Cayley to the more volatile Mark. Cayley's qualities, as  they appeared to Bill, may have been chiefly negative; but even if this  merit lay in the fact that he never exposed whatever weaknesses he may  have had, this is an excellent quality in a fellow-guest (or, if you  like, fellow-host) in a house where one is continually visiting. Mark's  weaknesses, on the other hand, were very plain to the eye, and Bill had  seen a good deal of them.    Yet, though he had hesitated to define his position that morning in  regard to Mark, he did not hesitate to place himself on the side of the  Law against Cayley. Mark, after all, had done him no harm, but Cayley  had committed an unforgivable offence. Cayley had listened secretly to  a private conversation between himself and Tony. Let Cayley hang, if the  Law demanded it.    Antony looked at his watch and stood up.    \"Come along,\" he said. \"It's time for that job I spoke about.\"    \"The passage?\" said Bill eagerly.    \"No; the thing which I said that I had to do this afternoon.\"    \"Oh, of course. What is it?\"    Without saying anything, Antony led the way indoors to the office.    It was three o'clock, and at three o'clock yesterday Antony and Cayley  had found the body. At a few minutes after three, he had been looking  out of the window of the adjoining room, and had been surprised suddenly  to find the door open and Cayley behind him. He had vaguely wondered at  the time why he had expected the door to be shut, but he had had no time  then to worry the thing out, and he had promised himself to look into  it at his leisure afterwards. Possibly it meant nothing; possibly, if  it meant anything, he could have found out its meaning by a visit to  the office that morning. But he had felt that he would be more likely  to recapture the impressions of yesterday if he chose as far as possible  the same conditions for his experiment. So he had decided that three  o'clock that afternoon should find him once more in the office.    As he went into the room, followed by Bill, he felt it almost as a shock  that there was now no body of Robert lying there between the two doors.  But there was a dark stain which showed where the dead man's head had  been, and Antony knelt down over it, as he had knelt twenty-four hours  before.    \"I want to go through it again,\" he said. \"You must be Cayley. Cayley  said he would get some water. I remember thinking that water wasn't  much good to a dead man, and that probably he was only too glad to  do anything rather than nothing. He came back with a wet sponge and  a handkerchief. I suppose he got the handkerchief from the chest of  drawers. Wait a bit.\"    He got up and went into the adjoining room; looked round it, pulled open  a drawer or two, and, after shutting all the doors, came back to the  office.    \"The sponge is there, and there are handkerchiefs in the top right-hand  drawer. Now then, Bill, just pretend you're Cayley. You've just said  something about water, and you get up.\"    Feeling that it was all a little uncanny, Bill, who had been kneeling  beside his friend, got up and walked out. Antony, as he had done on the  previous day, looked up after him as he went. Bill turned into the room  on the right, opened the drawer and got the handkerchief, damped the  sponge and came back.    \"Well?\" he said wonderingly.    Antony shook his head.    \"It's all different,\" he said. \"For one thing, you made a devil of a  noise and Cayley didn't.\"    \"Perhaps you weren't listening when Cayley went in?\"    \"I wasn't. But I should have heard him if I could have heard him, and I  should have remembered afterwards.\"    \"Perhaps Cayley shut the door after him.\"    \"Wait!\"    He pressed his hand over his eyes and thought. It wasn't anything which  he had heard, but something which he had seen. He tried desperately hard  to see it again.... He saw Cayley getting up, opening the door from the  office, leaving it open and walking into the passage, turning to the  door on the right, opening it, going in, and then--What did his eyes see  after that? If they would only tell him again!    Suddenly he jumped up, his face alight. \"Bill, I've got it!\" he cried.    \"What?\"    \"The shadow on the wall! I was looking at the shadow on the wall. Oh,  ass, and ten times ass!\"    Bill looked uncomprehendingly at him. Antony took his arm and pointed to  the wall of the passage.    \"Look at the sunlight on it,\" he said. \"That's because you've left the  door of that room open. The sun comes straight in through the windows.  Now, I'm going to shut the door. Look! D'you see how the shadow moves  across? That's what I saw--the shadow moving across as the door shut  behind him. Bill, go in and shut the door behind you--quite naturally.  Quick!\"    Bill went out and Antony knelt, watching eagerly.    \"I thought so!\" he cried. \"I knew it couldn't have been that.\"    \"What happened?\" said Bill, coming back.    \"Just what you would expect. The sunlight came, and the shadow moved  back again--all in one movement.\"    \"And what happened yesterday?\"    \"The sunlight stayed there; and then the shadow came very slowly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#18)"],[1,"asylum.\"    Try as he might, he couldn't fling off the impression of tragedy the  meeting of Socola with Jennie had produced. He was in a nervous fit to  see and tell her of his love. Why the devil hadn't he done so before  anyhow? They might have been engaged and ready to be married by this  time. They had met when she was sixteen.    Why on earth couldn't he throw off the fool idea that he was going to  lose her? His big fist suddenly closed with resolution.    \"I'll not lose her! I'll wring that viper's neck--I'll wade through  blood and death and the fires of h--\"    Just as he was plunging waist deep through the flames of the Pit, she  appeared in the door, the picture of wistful, tender beauty.    He rose awkwardly and extended his hand.    \"Good morning, Dick!\"    \"Good morning, Jennie--\"    Her hand was hot, her eyes heavy with tears.    \"What's the matter?\" he asked.    \"As if you didn't know--I've been saying good-by to some of the dearest  friends I've ever known. It's terrible. I just feel it's the end of the  world--\"    He started to say: \"Don't worry, Jennie darling, you have me. I love  you!\" The thought of it made the cold beads of perspiration suddenly  stand out on his forehead. It was one thing to think such  things--another to say it aloud to a girl with Jennie's serious brown  eyes.    She seemed terribly serious this morning and far away somehow. Never had  he seen her so utterly lovely. The mood of tender seriousness made her  more beautiful than ever. If he only dared to crush her in his arms and  laugh the smiles back into her eyes.    When he spoke it was only a commonplace he managed to blurt out:    \"So you're really going to-morrow?\"    \"Yes--we've telegraphed the boys to come home from school at once and  join us in Montgomery.\"    He tried to say it again, but the speech turned out to be political, not  personal.    \"Of course Virginia'll stand by her Southern sisters, Jennie--\"    \"Yes--\"    \"It's just a few old moss-backs holding her. No army will ever march  across her soil to fight a Southern State--\"    \"I hope not.\"    \"Of course not. I'll meet them on the border with one musket anyhow--\"    The girl was looking out the window at the slowly drizzling rain and  made no answer. He flushed at her apparent indifference to his heroic  stand.    \"Don't you believe I would?\"    \"Would what, Dick?\" she smiled, recovering herself from her reverie.    It was no use beating about the bush, trying to talk politics. He had to  make the plunge.    He suddenly took her hand in his.    She threw him a startled look, sat bolt upright, made the faintest  effort to draw her hand away, and blushed furiously.    He was in for it now. There was no retreat. He gripped with desperate  earnestness, tried to speak, and choked.    He drew a deep breath, tried again and only squeezed her hand harder.    The girl began to smile in a sweet, triumphant way. It was nice, this  conscious power over a big, stunning six-footer who grasped her hand as  a drowning man a straw. The sense of her strength was thrilling.    She looked at him with demure reproach.    \"Dick!\"    He grinned sheepishly and clung to her hand.    \"Yes--Jennie--\"    \"Do you know what you are doing?\"    \"No--but--I  know--what--I'm--trying--to--do--and--I'm--going--to--do--it--\"    Again his big hand crushed hers.    \"You're trying to break every bone in my hand as near as I can make  out--I'd like it back when you're through with it--\"    He found his tongue at last:    \"I--I--can't let you have it back, Jennie, I'm going to keep it  forever--\"    \"Really?\"    \"Yes--I am. I--I love you--Jennie--don't you love me--just--a--little  bit?\"    The girl laughed.    \"No!\"    \"Not the least--little--tiny--bit?\"    \"I don't think so--\"    The hand slipped through his limp fingers and he stared at her in a  hopeless, pitiful way.    Her heart went out in a wave of tender sympathy. She put her hand back  in his in a wistful touch.    \"I'm sorry, Dick dear, I didn't think you loved me in that way--\"    \"What did you think I was hanging round you so much for?\"    \"I knew you liked me, of course. And I like you--but I've never thought  seriously about love.\"    \"There's no other fellow?\"    \"Of course, not--\"    \"You liked that Socola, didn't you?\"    \"I liked him--yes--\"    \"I thought so.\"    \"He's cultured, handsome, interesting--\"    \"He's a sissy!\"    \"Dick!\"    \"A little wizened-faced rat--the spider-snake! I could break his long  neck. Yes--you do like him! I saw it when you met him. You're throwing  me down because you met him!\"    \"Dick!\"    \"But he shan't have you, I tell you--I'll show him I could lick a  thousand such sissies with one hand tied behind me.\"    The girl rose with dignity.    \"Don't you dare to speak to me like that, sir--\"    \"You're going to see that fellow again--I'll bet you've got an  engagement with him now--to-night--to-day!\"    The slender figure rose.    \"I'll see him if I please--when I please and where I please and I'll not  consult you about it, Dick Welford--Good day!\"    Trembling with anger the big, awkward boy turned and stumbled out of the  house.          CHAPTER VI    GOD'S WILL      Dick Welford had played directly into the hands of his enemy. When  Socola called at the Barton home to pay his respects to Miss Jennie and  wish them health and happiness and success in their new and dangerous  enterprise, he found the girl in a receptive mood. The accusation of  interest had stimulated her to her first effort to entertain the  self-poised and gentlemanly foreigner.    He turned to Jennie with a winning appeal in his modulated voice:    \"Will you do me a very great favor, Miss Barton?\"    \"If I can--certainly,\" was the quick answer.    \"I wish to meet your distinguished father. He is a great Southern  leader. I have been commissioned by the Sardinian Ministry to cultivate  the acquaintance of the leaders of the Confederacy. I am to make a  report direct to the Court of King Emmanuel on the prospects of the  South.\"    Jennie rose with a smile.    \"With pleasure. I'll call father at once.\"    Barton was delighted at the announcement.    \"Invite him to spend a week with us at Fairview,\" Jennie suggested.    \"Good idea--we'll show him what Southern hospitality means!\"    Burton grasped Socola's outstretched hand with enthusiasm.    \"Permit me,\" he began in his grand way, \"to extend you a welcome to the  South. Your King is interested in our movement. It's natural. Europe  must reckon with us from the first. Cotton is the real King. We are  going to build on this staple an industrial empire whose influence will  dominate the world. The sooner the political rulers realize this the  better.\"    Socola bowed.    \"I quite agree with you, Senator Barton. His Majesty King Victor  Emmanuel has great plans for the future. He is profoundly interested in  your movement. He does not believe that the map of Italy has yet been  fixed. It will be quite easy to convince his brilliant, open mind that  the boundaries of this country may be readjusted--\"    \"I shall be delighted to show you every courtesy within my power, sir,\"  Barton responded. \"You must go South with us to-morrow and spend a week  at Fairview, our country estate. You must meet my grand old father and  my mother and see the curse of slavery at its worst!\"    Barton laughed heartily and slipped his arm persuasively about the  graceful shoulders of his guest.    \"I hadn't thought of being so honored, I assure you--\"    He paused and looked at Jennie with a timid sort of appeal.    \"Come with us--we'll be delighted to have you--\"    \"I'll enjoy it, I'm sure,\" he said hesitatingly. \"We will reach  Montgomery in time for the meeting of the Convention of Seceding  States?\"    \"Certainly,\" Barton replied. \"I'm already elected a delegate from my  State. Her secession is but a question of days.\"    Socola's white, even teeth gleamed in a happy smile.    \"I'll go with pleasure, Senator. You leave to-morrow?\"    \"The ten-twenty train for the South. You'll join our party, of course?\"    \"Of course.\"    With a graceful bow he hurried home to complete the final preparations  for his departure. He walked with quick, strong step. And yet as he  approached the door of the little house in the humbler quarter of the  city his gait unconsciously slowed down.    He dreaded this last struggle with his mother. But it must come. He  entered the modestly furnished sitting room and looked at her calm,  sweet face with a sudden sinking. She would be absolutely alone in the  world. And yet no harm could befall her. She was the friend of every  human being who knew her. It was the agony of this parting he dreaded  and the loneliness that would torture her in his absence.    He spoke with forced cheerfulness.    \"Well, mater, it's all settled. I leave at ten-twenty to-morrow  morning.\"    She rose and placed her hands on his shoulders. The tears blinded her.    \"How little I thought when I taught your boyish lips to speak the  musical tongue of Italy I was preparing this bitter hour for my soul! I  begged your father to resign his consulship at Genoa and brought you  home to teach you the great lesson--to love your country and reverence  your country's God. And since your father's death the dream of my heart  has been to see you a minister, teaching and uplifting the people into a  higher and nobler life--\"    \"That is my aim, mater dear. I am consecrating body, mind and soul to  the task now of saving the Union, an inheritance priceless and glorious  to millions yet unborn. I'm going to break the chains that bind slaves.  I'm going to break the brutal and cruel power of the Southern Tyranny  that has been strangling the nation for forty years!\"    His eyes flashed with the fire of fanatical enthusiasm.    He slipped his arm about his mother's slender waist, drew her to the  window and pointed to the unfinished dome of the white, majestic  capitol.    \"See, mater dear, the sun is bursting"]]]
