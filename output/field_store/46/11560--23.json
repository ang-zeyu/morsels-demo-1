Some  distance below the roof there is usually an open ceiling of reeds,  used for the purpose of storing and drying fruits and other things,  and especially, as will be seen hereafter, for drying fruit required  in the preparation for the big feast.    Fig. 4 is a diagram of the front of an _emone_, disclosing the internal  plan of the floor and fireplace, for which purpose the front hood of  the roof and the front platform are omitted from the plan, and of the  horizontal front timbers the third up from the bottom is shown at the  ends only, the middle part being omitted, and small portions of the  timbers immediately above them are omitted. The words in parentheses  appearing in the explanatory notes to the figure are the Mafulu names  for the various parts of the building.      _Explanatory Notes to Fig._ 4.      (_a_) Main posts, one at the front of the building, one in the middle,  and one at the back (_apopo_).    (_b_) Posts supporting roof, a line of them running along each side  (_tedele_).    (_c_) Posts supporting outer edge of flooring, a line of them on each  side (_emuje_ or _aje_).    (_d_) Post supporting inner edge of flooring and hearth, a line of  them on each side (_foj' ul' emuje_).    (_e_) Lower ridge pole (_tanguve_).    (_f_) Main downward-sloping roof work, strongly made, going all the  way back, only four or five of them on each side (_loko-loko_).    (_g_) Upper ridge pole (_tope_).    (_h_) Main horizontal roof work, resting on _f_ (_gegebe_).    (_i_) Upper downward-sloping roof work, not so thick as _f_ resting  on _h_, going all the way back at intervals of about 1 foot (_engala_).    (_k_) Upper horizontal roof work, not so thick as _h_  resting on _i_ (_gegebe_)    (_l_) Thatch made of leaves (_asase_).    _Note._--The roof (excluding the hood) projects forward and overhangs  a little beyond the post _a_, so as to overhang the greater part, but  not the whole, of the platform; the hood (not shown in this figure)  is really intended to shelter the platform.    (_m_) Pole supporting roof (_karia_).    (_n_) Pole supporting outer edge of floor (_karia_).    (_o_) Pole supporting inner edge of floor and enclosing hearth  (_jakusube_).    (_p_) Floor, composed of transverse woodwork (_koimame_) with thin  light longitudinal lath work on top of it (_ondovo_).    (_q_) Pole above inner edge of floor and edging hearth, not so thick  as _o_ (_bubuje_).    (_r_) Floor of fireplace, upon which soil is put (_foj' ul maovo_).    (_s_) Pieces of wood supported by _c_ and _d_, going right across  building and over floor of fireplace, but under its earth, all the  way back (_kooije_).    (_t_) Wall timbers below top of door-opening, at front and back  (_kautape_).    _Note._--_t_(1)goes right across under door-opening, but the middle  portion of it is omitted from the diagram, and the lower edges  of timbers _t_ (2) are partly broken off, so as to show floor and  fireplace.    (_u_) Wall timbers above top of door-opening (_dibindi_).    _Note._--_t_ and _u_ together-the whole wall-are called _bou_.    (_v_) Uprights bracing together _t_ and _u_ (Mafulu name unknown).    (_w_) Ceiling made with reeds and used for storing and drying fruit,  etc. It may occupy the whole length of the building and the whole  width of it, or part only of either or both of these (_avale_).    (_x_) Space filled up with soil and used as hearth (_foje_).    (_y_) Door-opening, one at back also (_akomimbe_).        Fig. 5 is a diagram of a transverse section across the centre of an  _emone_, showing the internal construction. The explanatory note only  deals with portions not explained in those to Fig. 4.    _Explanatory Note to Fig._ 5.    Post _a_ is the main central support of the building corresponding  with post _a_ in Fig. 4. Posts _b b_ are central side supports to  the roof. Poles _c_ and _d_ are attached to posts _a b b_, and help  to strengthen the fabric. These poles are also used for hanging up  sleeping hammocks, the other extremities of which are hung to the  _loko-loko_ of the roof (Fig. 4, _f_). The name for post _a_ is _dudu_,  but this word is often used to express the whole structure _a b b c d_.    I have endeavoured in the diagrammatic sketch--Fig. 6--to illustrate  the apse-like projection of the roof of an _emone_ and the platform  arrangements. I have in this sketch denuded the apse roof of its  thatch, showing it in skeleton only; and I have shaded all timber  work behind the platform, in order more clearly to define the latter.    _Explanatory Notes to Fig._ 6.    (_a_) Front end of thatch (_asase_) of main roof.    (_b c d_) Front apse-shaped roof (_siafele_), the thatch having been  removed to show its internal construction.    (_b c, b e, b d_) Downward-sloping roof work (_engala_).    (_f f, c d_] Horizontal roof work (_gegebe_), carried round in curves.    _Note._--Sometimes the apse-shaped roof is constructed as a  continuation of the main roof of the building, in which case  the _gegebe_ of the former are a continuation of those of the  latter. Sometimes the apse roof is a separate appendage, not connected  with the main roof, and in that case the _gegebe_ of the former are  separate from those of the latter, and are fixed at their extremities  to the _loko-loko_ of the main roof.    (_g_) Posts supporting the platform (_purum'-ul' emuge_).    (_h_) Horizontal platform supports resting at one end on _g_ and at  the other end fixed to either the _tedele_ or the _emuje_.    (_i_) Platform (_purume_).    _Note._--It will be seen that the front _apopo_ passes through the  platform.    (_k_) Additional supports to the apse roof, which are sometimes added,  but are not usual. Their lower ends rest on the platform and they are  connected with the apse roof at its outer edge (Mafulu name unknown).    (_l_) A stump by which to get on to the platform. This is often a  rough sloping piece of tree-trunk; where the platform of the emone  is high it is a rudely constructed ladder (_gigide_).    _Note._--The entire facade of the front gable end is called _konimbe_  (which means door) or _purume_ (which means platform). That of the  back gable end is called _apei_.    _Note._--The height of the door-opening above the outside platform  is shown in this figure.    The houses are in construction very similar to the _emone_, and in  fact the above description of the latter may be taken as a description  of a house, subject to the following modifications: (i.) The house is  never raised high, its floor always being within a foot or two of the  ground, (ii.) It is smaller than the _emone_, its average internal  dimensions being about 8 to 12 feet long, and 8 to 10 feet wide,  (iii.) The roof generally slopes down on both sides to the level of  the ground (concealing the side structure of the house) or nearly  so. (iv.) The projecting hood of the roof is only added at the front  of the building, and not at the rear; and it is usually separate from,  and not continuous with, the real roof. [61] (v.) The platform is  generally small and narrow, and often only extends for half the length  of the front of the house, and, being always within a foot or two of  the ground, it does not possess or require a ladder or tree-trunk  approach; it is also narrower. Frequently there is no platform at  all. (vi.) There is no entrance opening at the back of the house,  (vii.) The front entrance opening is smaller and narrower and more  difficult of entry. When the family are absent, they generally put  sticks across this opening to bar entry, whereas the entrance opening  of the _emone_ is always open, (viii.) The centre house support very  often consists of one post only, instead of a combination, (ix.) There  is often on one side of the entrance opening a small space of the  inside of the house fenced off for occupation by the pigs, and there is  a little aperture by which they can get into this space from outside,  (x.) The _avale_ ceiling is usually absent; and, even if there be one,  it will only extend under a small portion of the roof. [62]    The following are explanations of my plates of villages and their  buildings.

Communications.    The native paths of the Mafulu people, or at all events those passing  through forests, are, like those of most other mountain natives,  usually difficult for white men to traverse. The forest tracks in  particular are often quite unrecognisable as such to an inexperienced  white man, and are generally very narrow and beset with a tangle of  stems and hanging roots and creepers of the trees and bush undergrowth,  which catch the unwary traveller across the legs or body or hands  or face at every turn, and are often so concealed by the grass and  vegetation that, unless he be very careful, he is apt to be constantly  tripped up by them; and moreover these entanglements are often armed  with thorns or prickles, or have serrated edges, a sweep of which may  tear the traveller's clothes, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#18)"],[1,"form for stories about  such persons as the Gracchi and Bluecher,[223] and, what is still more  curious, for tirades against the Oriental tendency.[224] A poet of  different calibre is Daumer, whose _Hafis_ (Hamb. 1846) for a long time  was regarded as a translation, whereas the poems of the collection are  in reality original productions in Hafid's manner, just like Rueckert's  _Oestliche Rosen_.[225] Their sensuous, passionate eroticism, however, is  not a genuine Hafid quality, as we before have seen. The same criticism  applies even much more forcibly to Schefer's _Hafis in Hellas_ (Hamburg,  1853).[226] Special mention is due to the gifted, but unfortunate,  Heinrich Leuthold, whose _Ghaselen_ deserve to be placed by the side of  Platen's. Like Platen and Rueckert, he too proclaims himself a reveller:        Zur Gottheit ward die Schoenheit mir      Und mein Gebet wird zum Ghasel.--    But these _Ghaselen_ do not attempt to be so intensely Persian as to  reproduce the objectionable features of Persian poetry. Thus Leuthold  sings:        Vor allem ein Lebehoch dem Hafis, dem Patriarchen der Zunft!--      D'rum bringe die liebliche Schenkin das Gold gefuellter Becher              hinein![227]    Evidently the poet sees no necessity for retaining the _saqi_, but makes  the poem more acceptable to Western taste by substituting a \"Schenkin\"  for Platen's \"Schenke.\"    The Oriental story was cultivated by J.F. Castelli. Many of the subjects  of his _Orientalische Granaten_ (Dresden, 1852) had already been used by  Rueckert. Another Oriental storyteller in verse is Ludwig Bowitsch, whose  _Sindibad_ (Leipzig, 1860) contains mostly Arabic material. Friedrich  von Sallet has written a poem on _Zerduscht_[228] which gives the  Iranian legend of the attempt made by the sorcerers to burn the newborn  child.[229] It would, however, lead us too far were we to mention single  poems on Oriental subjects or of Oriental tendency.           *       *       *       *       *    Head and shoulders above all these less known poets towers the figure of  Count von Schack, who, like Rueckert, combined the poetic gift with the  learning of the scholar, and who thus stands out a worthy successor of  the German Brahman as a representative of the idea of the  _Weltlitteratur_. A discussion of his work is a fitting close for this  investigation.      FOOTNOTES:    [222] On these see Paul Horn, Was verdanken Wir Persien, in Nord u. Sued,  Heft 282, p. 386 seq.

His Fame as Translator of Firdausi--Stimmen vom        Ganges--Sakuntala compared with the Original in the        Mahabharata--His Oriental Scholarship in his Original        Poems--Attitude towards Hafizian Singers.      As an Orientalist, von Schack's scholarship is amply attested by his  numerous and excellent translations from Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit.  His _Heldensagen des Firdusi_, as is well known, has become a standard  work of German literature. In fact, we may say that his reputation rests  more upon his translations than upon his poems.    Though we have consistently refrained from discussing translations, it  is felt that the _Stimmen vom Ganges_, which is a collection of Indic  legends from various sources, especially from the _Puranas_, cannot be  left entirely out of consideration.[230] In many respects these poems  have the charm of original work. The models moreover are used with great  freedom. To cite von Schack's own words: \"Fuer eigentliche Uebertragungen  koennen diese Dichtungen in der Gestalt, wie sie hier vorliegen, nicht  gelten, da bei der Bearbeitung bald groessere bald geringere Freiheit  gewaltet hat, auch manches Stoerende und Weitschweifige ausgeschieden  wurde; doch hielt ich es fuer unstatthaft, am Wesentlichen des Stoffes  und der Motive Aenderungen vorzunehmen. In Gedanken und Ausdruck haben,  wenn nicht der jedesmal vorliegende Text, so doch stets Indische Werke  zu Vorbildern gedient.\"[231]    A brief comparison of any one of these poems with the Sanskrit original  will show the correctness of this statement. Let us take, as an  illustration, the second, which gives the famous legend of Sakuntala  from the _Mahabharata_ (i. 69-74; Bombay ed. i. 92-100).    Schack leaves out unnecessary details and wearisome repetitions. Thus  the elaborate account of the Brahmans whom the king sees on entering the  hermitage of Kanva and their different occupations (_Mbh_. 70, 37-47) is  condensed into fourteen lines, p. 36. Again, in the original, when  Sakuntala tells the story of her birth, the speech by which Indra urges  Menaka to undertake the temptation of Visvamitra is given at some length  (_Mbh_. 71, 20-26); so also the reply of the timid nymph (ibid. 71,  27-42); the story of the temptation itself is narrated with realistic  detail in true Hindu fashion (ibid. 72, 1-9). All this takes up  thirty-three _slokas_. Schack devotes to it barely five lines, p. 38;  the speeches of Indra and Menaka he omits altogether. Again, when the  king proposes to the fair maid, he enters into a learned disquisition on  the eight kinds of marriage, explaining which ones are proper for each  caste, which ones are never proper, and so forth; finally he proposes  the Gandharva form (_Mbh_. 73, 6-14). It is needless to say that in  Schack's poem the king's proposal is much less didactic and much more  direct, pp. 40, 41.    On the other hand, to see how closely the poet sometimes follows his  model we need but compare all that follows the words \"Kaum war er  gegangen,\" p. 42, to \"Dem sind nimmerdar die Goetter gnaedig,\" p. 47, with  the Sanskrit original (_Mbh_. 73, 24-74, 33).    Minor changes in phrases or words, advisable on aesthetic grounds, are  of course frequent. Similes, for instance, appealing too exclusively to  Hindu taste, were made more general. Thus in Sakuntala's reply to the  king, p. 51, the faults of others are likened in size to sand grains,  and those of himself to glebes. In Sanskrit, however, the comparison is  to mustard-grains and bilva-fruits respectively. A few lines further on  the maid declares:                  \"So ueberragt mein Stamm denn      Weit den deinen, wisse das, Duschmanta!\"    which passage in the original reads: _avayor antaram pasya meru  sarsapor iva_, \"behold! the difference between us is like that between  a mustard-seed and Mount Meru.\" In the same speech of Sakuntala the  Sanskrit introduces a striking simile which Schack omits as too  specifically Indic:        _murkho hi jalpatam pumsam srutva vacah subhasubhah      asubham vakyam adatte purisam iva sukarah      prajnas tu jalpatam pumsam srutva vacah subhasubhah      gunavad vakyam adatte hamsah ksiram ivambhasah_                                        (_Mbh_. 74. 90, 91.)         \"The fool having heard men's speeches containing good and evil       chooses the evil just as a hog dirt; but the wise man having heard       men's speeches containing good and evil chooses the worthy, just       as a swan (separates) milk from water.\"[232]    We believe that these illustrations will suffice to give an idea of the  relation which Schack's poems bear to the originals.           *       *       *       *       *    His fondness for things Oriental finds also frequent expression in his  own poems. In _Naechte des Orients_ (vol. i. p. 7 seq.),[233] like Goethe  before him, he undertakes a poetic Hegira to the East:        Entfliehen lasst mich, fliehn aus den Gewirren      Des Occidents zum heitern Morgenland!    So he visits the native towns of Firdausi and Hafid and pays his  respect to their memory, and then penetrates also into India, where he  hears from the lips of a Buddhist monk an exposition of Nirvana  philosophy, which, however, is unacceptable to him (p. 111). The  Oriental scenes that are brought before our mind, both in this poem as  well as in \"Memnon\" (vol. vii. p. 5 seq.), are of course portrayed with  poetic feeling as well as scholarly accuracy. The _haji_ who owns the  wonderful elixir,--which, by the way, is said to come from India (p.  33),--and who interprets each vision that the poet lives through from  the standpoint of the pessimistic sceptic, shows the influence of 'Umar  Xayyam. In fact he indulges sometimes in unmistakable reminiscences of  the quatrains of the famous astronomer-poet, as when he says:        Wie Schattenbilder, die an der Laterne,      Wenn sie der Gaukler schiebt, voruebergleiten,      So zieht die bloede, willenlose Herde,      Die Menschheit mein' ich, ueber diese Erde. (p. 55.)    This is very much the same thought as in the following quatrain of 'Umar  (Whinf. 310; Bodl. 108):         [Arabic]       [Arabic]       [Arabic]       [Arabic]    which stands first in Schack's own translation of the Persian poet and  is thus rendered:        Fuer eine magische Laterne ist diese ganze Welt zu halten,        In welcher wir voll Schwindel leben;      Die Sonne haengt darin als Lampe; die Bilder aber und Gestalten        Sind wir, die d'ran vorueberschweben.[234]    In his _Weihgesaenge_ (vol. ii. p. 149) Schack sends a greeting to the  Orient; in another one of these songs he sings the praises of India  (ibid. p. 232), and in still another he apostrophizes Zoroaster (ibid.  p. 133). A division of this volume (ii.) bears the title _Lotosblaetter_.  The sight of the scholar's chamber with its Sanskrit manuscripts makes  him dream of India's gorgeous scenery and inspires a poem \"Das indische  Gemach\" (vol. x. p. 26).    Oriental stories and legends are also offered, though not"]]]
