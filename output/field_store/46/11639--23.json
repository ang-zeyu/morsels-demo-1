Her bodily mechanism will then run smoothly, and the child  will get from her blood the nourishment needed for its development.  Beyond that there is nothing the mother can do to influence the  development of her child.    There is another and somewhat similar fallacy which deserves a passing  word, although it is of more concern to the livestock breeder than to  the eugenist. It is called telegony and is, briefly, this: that  conception by a female results in a definite modification of her  germ-plasm from the influence of the male, and that this modification  will be shown in the offspring she may subsequently bear to a second  male. The only case where it is often invoked in the human race is in  miscegenation. A white woman has been married to a Negro, for instance,  and has borne one or more mulatto offspring. Subsequently, she mates  with a white man; but her children by him, instead of being pure white,  it is alleged, will be also mulattoes. The idea of telegony, the  persistent influence of the first mating, may be invoked to explain this  discrepancy.    It is a pure myth. There is no good evidence[29] to support it, and  there is abundant evidence to contradict it. Telegony is still believed  by many animal breeders, but it has no place in science. In such a case  as the one quoted, the explanation is undoubtedly that the supposed  father is not the real one; and this explanation will dispose of all  other cases of telegony which can not be explained, as in most instances  they can be, by the mixed ancestry of the offspring and the innate  tendency of all living things to vary.    Now to sum up this long chapter. We started with a consideration of the  germ-plasm, the physical basis of life; pointing out that it is  continuous from generation to generation, and potentially immortal; that  it is carefully isolated and guarded in the body, so that it is not  likely to be injured by any ordinary means.    One of the logical results of this continuity of the germ-plasm is that  modifications of the body of the parent, or acquired characters, can  hardly be transferred to the germ-plasm and become a part of the  inheritance. Further the experimental evidence upholds this position,  and the inheritance of acquired body characters may be disregarded by  eugenics, which is therefore obliged to concern itself solely with the  material already in existence in the germ-plasm, except as that material  may be changed by variation which can neither be predicted nor  controlled.    The evidence that the germ-plasm can be permanently modified does not  warrant the belief; and such results, if they exist at all, are not  large enough or uniform enough to concern the eugenist.    Pre-natal culture and telegony were found to be mere delusions. There is  no justification for hoping to influence the race for good through the  action of any kind of external influences; and there is not much danger  of influencing it for ill through these external influences. The  situation must be faced squarely then: if the race is to be improved, it  must be by the use of the material already in existence; by endeavor to  change the birth-and death-rates so as to alter the relative proportions  of the amounts of good and bad germ-plasm in the race. This is the only  road by which the goal of eugenics can be reached.          CHAPTER III    DIFFERENCES AMONG MEN      While Mr. Jefferson, when he wrote into the Declaration of Independence  his belief in the self-evidence of the truth that all men are created  equal, may have been thinking of legal rights merely, he was expressing  an opinion common among philosophers of his time. J. J. Rousseau it was  who made the idea popular, and it met with widespread acceptance for  many years. It is not surprising, therefore, that the phrase has long  been a favorite with the demagogue and the utopian. Even now the  doctrine is by no means dead. The American educational system is based  largely on this dogma, and much of the political system seems to be  grounded on it. It can be seen in the tenets of labor unions, in the  practice of many philanthropies--traces may be found almost anywhere one  turns, in fact.    Common enough as applied to mental qualities, the theory of human  equality is even more widely held of \"moral\" qualities. Men are  considered to be equally responsible for their conduct, and failure to  conform to the accepted code in this respect brings punishment. It is  sometimes conceded that men have had differing opportunities to learn  the principles of morality; but given equal opportunities, it is almost  universally held that failure to follow the principles indicates not  inability but unwillingness. In short, public opinion rarely admits that  men may differ in their inherent capacity to act morally.    In view of its almost universal and unquestioned, although half  unconscious, acceptance as part of the structure of society, it becomes  of the utmost importance that this doctrine of human equality should be  examined by scientific methods.    Fortunately this can be done with ease. Methods of mental and physical  measurement that have been evolved during the last few decades offer  results that admit of no refutation, and they can be applied in hundreds  of different places.    [Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF 10-YEAR-OLD SCHOOL CHILDREN    FIG. 8.--The graph shows that 10-year-old children in  Connecticut (1903) are to be found in every grade, from the first to the  eighth. The greatest number is in the fourth grade, and the number who  are advanced is just about the same as the number who are retarded.]    It will not be worth while to spend any time demonstrating that all  individuals differ, at birth and during their subsequent life,  physically. The fact is patent to all. It carries with it as a necessary  corollary mental differences, since the brain is part of the body;  nevertheless, we shall demonstrate these mental differences  independently.    We present in Fig. 8 a graph from E. L. Thorndike, showing the number of  10-year-old children in Connecticut (1903) in each school grade. If the  children are all intellectually equal, all the 10-year-olds ought to be  in the same grade, or near it. Numerous explanations of their wide  distribution suggest themselves; as a working hypothesis one might adopt  the suggestion that it is because the children actually differ in innate  ability to the extent here indicated. This hypothesis can be tested by  a variety of mental measurements. S. A. Courtis' investigation of the  arithmetical abilities of the children in the schools of New York City  will be a good beginning. He measured the achievements of pupils in  responding to eight tests, which were believed to give a fair idea of  the pupil's capacity for solving simple arithmetical problems. The  results were, on the average, similar to the result he got in a certain  eighth-grade class, whose record is shown in Fig. 9. It is evident that  some of the children were good in arithmetic, some were poor in it; the  bulk of them were neither good nor bad but half way between, or, in  statistical language, mediocre.    [Illustration: VARIATION IN ABILITY    FIG. 9.--Diagram to show the standing of children in a single  class in a New York City school, in respect to their ability in  arithmetic. There are wide divergences in the scores they made.]    The literature of experimental psychology and anthropology is crammed  with such examples as the above. No matter what trait of the individual  be chosen, results are analogous. If one takes the simplest traits, to  eliminate the most chances for confusion, one finds the same conditions  every time. Whether it be speed in marking off all the A's in a printed  sheet of capitals, or in putting together the pieces of a puzzle, or in  giving a reaction to some certain stimulus, or in making associations  between ideas, or drawing figures, or memory for various things, or  giving the opposites of words, or discrimination of lifted weights, or  success in any one of hundreds of other mental tests, the conclusion is  the same. There are wide differences in the abilities of individuals, no  two being alike, either mentally or physically, at birth or any time  thereafter.    [Illustration: ORIGIN OF A NORMAL PROBABILITY CURVE    FIG. 10.--When deviations in all directions are equally  probable, as in the case of shots fired at a target by an expert  marksman, the \"frequencies\" will arrange themselves in the manner shown  by the bullets in compartments above. A line drawn along the tops of  these columns would be a \"normal probability curve.\" Diagram by C. H.  Popenoe.]    Whenever a large enough number of individuals is tested, these  differences arrange themselves in the same general form. It is the form  assumed by the distribution of any differences that are governed  absolutely by chance.    Suppose an expert marksman shoots a thousand times at the center of a  certain picket in a picket fence, and that there is no wind or any  other source of constant error that would distort his aim. In the long  run, the greatest number of his shots would be in the picket aimed at,  and of his misses there would be just as many on one side as on the  other, just as many above as below the center. Now if all the shots, as  they struck the fence, could drop into a box below, which had a  compartment for each picket, it would be found at the end of his  practice that the compartments were filled up unequally, most bullets  being in that representing the middle picket and least in the outside  ones. The intermediate compartments would have intermediate numbers of  bullets. The whole scheme is shown in Fig. 11. If a line be drawn to  connect the tops of all the columns of bullets, it will make a rough  curve or graph, which represents a typical chance distribution.

I have even  seen some who pretended to regard this favorite dish as a way of  doing homage to the emperor. Napoleon's favorite dish was a sort of  chicken-fricassee, called, in honor of the conqueror of Italy,  '_fricassee a la Marengo_.'\"--Constant, Memoires, vol. ii., p. 56.]    Napoleon's guests had done well in dining beforehand; for, as the  servants did not attend to them so quickly as to their master, and as  they, moreover, were not able to eat so fast as he, they would assuredly  have risen hungry from the table.[14]    [Footnote 14: The guests invited to the imperial table always dined  beforehand. The emperor, in the haste with which he ate, did not notice  that the others had no time to do so. Once, when he departed from the  table, and Eugene, his stepson, rose immediately after him, Napoleon  turned to him, and said:    \"But you have had no time to eat?\"    \"Pardon me,\" replied the prince, \"I dined beforehand.\"--\"Memoires de  Constant,\" vol. ii., p. 55.]    \"To horse, gentlemen!\" exclaimed Napoleon. \"Let us ride over to  Sans-souci, and do homage to the manes of the king who was a philosopher  and a great general at the same time.\"    The streets of Potsdam were deserted as the emperor and his brilliant  suite rode through them. All the windows were closed; the citizens were  nowhere to be seen; only a crowd of idle boys followed the imperial  cavalcade. The soldiers of the grand French army alone greeted the  emperor with joyous cheers outside of the city, where they were  encamped. Potsdam thought, perhaps, of its king, who had immortalized  it, and was sad and ashamed that those whom Frederick the Great had  routed in so glorious a manner at Rossbach now made their triumphal  entry into his capital.    Napoleon's brow was gloomy; this silence of the population was  disagreeable and oppressive. It seemed to him to be a sign of the  hostile spirit of the Prussians; and as he was riding slowly, his head  slightly bent forward, along the avenue toward Sans-souci, he muttered:  \"This is a malicious and infamous trick! The haughty nobility will still  oppose me, but I will crush them. They must not succeed, however, in  making me angry, but I shall chastise those who have induced the  citizens to remain at home, and not to greet me.\" And, thoughtfully, he  rode on toward the country-seat of Frederick the Great.    No one was at the palace to welcome him but the castellan, a venerable  man, who, with a few aged servants in faded liveries, received the  all-powerful conqueror at the open folding-doors of the hall leading to  the terrace. Napoleon looked at him with a rapid, piercing glance. \"You  lived in the period of Frederick II.?\" he asked hastily.    \"Yes, sire, we were fortunate enough to serve the great king,\" said the  castellan, in faultless, fluent French. \"Hence, the honorable task has  been intrusted to us to watch over his sacred resting-place, and to  protect it from injury.\"    \"The name of the great king is a sufficient protection for this house,\"  said Napoleon. \"My soldiers have a profound respect for true greatness;  they will not dare to desecrate this sanctuary. Be my guide, my friend.  Let me see the sitting-room of your king!\"    \"Of the present king, sire?\" asked the castellan.    Napoleon smiled. \"I think there is but one king in Sans-souci,\" he  said, \"and that is Frederick II. Conduct me to his sitting-room!\" and  rapidly crossing the semicircular marble hall, he walked toward the  side-door which the castellan opened.    \"Sire,\" he said, solemnly, \"this is the king's sitting-room; it is still  furnished precisely as when he lived in it. It has undergone no change  whatever.\"    Napoleon entered; his marshals followed him. None of them uttered a  word; every one seemed involuntarily to tread lightly, as if he feared  to disturb the silence reigning in this room, sacred by its great  reminiscences. The emperor walked rapidly into the middle of the room;  there he paused with folded arms, and his large dark eyes glided slowly  from object to object. The marshals moved softly around, and, on  contemplating the old-fashioned furniture, their ragged silken covers,  the plain desk with the inkstand placed near the window, the large  easy-chair, shrouded in a ragged purple blanket, smiled disdainfully and  whispered to each other that this was a room entirely unfit for a king,  and that one might purchase better and more tasteful furniture of any  second-hand dealer in Paris. Napoleon, perhaps, had overheard their  words, or at least noticed their whisperings, for he bent an angry  glance on them. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is a place which deserves  our profound respect. Here lived one who was a greater general than  Turenne, and from whose campaigns we all might derive instruction.  Alexander the Great himself would have admired Frederick's battle of  Leuthen.\"    The aged castellan, who was standing at the door, raised his head, and  with a kind glance seemed to thank Napoleon for the tribute he had paid  to the manes of the heroic dead.    The emperor's eyes were now fixed on the large clock placed on a gilded  pedestal. It was a master-piece of the period of Louis XV., and adorned  in the most brilliant roccoco style. The large dial, with the figures of  colored enamel, rested in a frame and case of splendidly-wrought gold,  and this was surmounted by a portrait of the Emperor Titus, with the  inscription, \"_Diem perdidi_.\"    \"Is that the clock which the king caused to be purchased from the heirs  of the Marquise de Pompadour?\"    \"Yes, sire, it is. It has always stood in this room, since he purchased  it. Frederick the Great prized it very highly, and consulted it  exclusively until his death. And it seemed to know that he liked it, for  when he closed his eyes, the clock stopped and never went again.\"    \"Ah,\" exclaimed Napoleon, quickly, \"since the death of Frederick the  government of Prussia, it seems, really did not know the time any more.  And what about that ragged old easy-chair? Did the king use it, too?\"    \"Sire,\" said the castellan, solemnly, laying stress on every word he  uttered--\"sire, the great king died in that chair; his head rested on  the pillow now lying on the seat, and he was covered with that blanket.\"    The emperor rapidly approached; the marshals followed his example and  walked toward it on tiptoe. He stood before it; his arms folded, his  lips compressed, contemplating it. Behind him stood the marshals, whose  indifferent countenances and curious glances contrasted strangely with  the pale face of their master. Not far from them, near the door, stood  the white-haired castellan; his hands clasped, and his head bowed  mournfully on his breast.    Suddenly the room was filled with light; the sun, which had hitherto  been hidden by clouds, burst forth and shone brilliantly; golden beams  fell upon the easy-chair of Frederick the Great, and surrounded it, as  it were, with a halo.    \"This, then, is the death-bed of the great king,\" said Napoleon,  musingly. \"The gods did not permit him to fall on the battle-field.  Disease and age vanquished the hero of the Seven Years' War, and he died  not amid the triumphs of his soldiers, but solitary and alone! May  Providence, in His mercy, preserve us from such a fate!\" And turning  quickly to the castellan, he asked, \"Were you present when the king  died?\"    \"Yes, sire, I was; for I was his _valet de chambre_.\"    \"Tell me the last words he uttered.\"    \"Sire, he spoke repeatedly, but so inaudibly and rapidly that we did not  apprehend him. The last words which we were able to understand were:  'Give me back my soldiers of the Seven Years' War! I am tired of ruling  over slaves!'\"    \"Strange, strange,\" murmured Napoleon; \"he was tired of ruling over  slaves! as though it were possible to rule over free men! Ah, I should  like to have known this king, who was such an autocrat, and yet despised  slaves! who wielded the sword as skilfully as the pen! to whom the  booming of the cannon sounded as melodious as the notes of his  flute--who made verses with Voltaire, and won battles with Schwerin and  Ziethen! He was able to do every thing, and we have not seen his  equal!\"    \"Oh, sire,\" murmured the marshals, \"your majesty forgets--\"    \"Silence, gentlemen!\" he exclaimed, in an angry voice, pointing with his  outstretched arm to the easy-chair, \"do not flatter me in _this_ room. I  wish I had known Frederick the Great, for I believe we should have  understood each other.\"    \"Sire,\" said the castellan, \"it is true, his majesty did not know you;  nevertheless, he dreamed of you.\"    Napoleon hastily turned toward him and asked: \"What? He dreamed of me?  Tell me all about it. Approach!\"    The castellan, obeying the sign made to him, advanced a few steps slowly  and hesitatingly.    \"Sire,\" he said, \"it was a few years after the Seven Years' War. I had  just entered the king's service, and was on duty during that night; that  is to say, I slept in the anteroom, and had received strict orders to  awaken the king at a fixed hour in the morning, and to enter his bedroom  during the night as soon as he called me, or if I should hear any noise.  Suddenly I heard the cry, 'Fire, fire!' I rushed immediately into the  bedroom, but no fire was to be seen. My master lay on his couch,  groaning, breathing heavily, and evidently under the influence of bad  dreams. I, therefore, took the liberty to awaken him. 'Ah,' said he,  heaving a deep sigh, 'I am glad you awakened me; I had a weird, terrible  dream, and I will relate it to you. I dreamed I was standing on the  terrace of Sans-souci, and around me I beheld my state and all my  palaces close together, and behind them I thought I could descry the  whole world, with all its cities and countries; it was spread out before  my eyes like a painting of wondrous beauty, and I was rapturously gazing  at it.
