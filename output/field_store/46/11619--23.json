I am the one, O my Lord, who hath forgotten all else but Thee, and turned  towards the Dayspring of Thy grace, who hath forsaken all save Thyself in  the hope of drawing nigh unto Thy court. Behold me, then, with mine eyes  lifted up towards the Seat that shineth with the splendors of the light of  Thy Face. Send down, then, upon me, O my Beloved, that which will enable  me to be steadfast in Thy Cause, so that the doubts of the infidels may  not hinder me from turning towards Thee.    Thou art, verily, the God of Power, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious,  the Almighty.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O God, my God! I have turned in repentance...\"      O God, my God! I have turned in repentance unto Thee, and verily Thou art  the Pardoner, the Compassionate.    O God, my God! I have returned to Thee, and verily Thou art the  Ever-Forgiving, the Gracious.    O God, my God! I have clung to the cord of Thy bounty, and with Thee is  the storehouse of all that is in heaven and earth.    O God, my God! I have hastened toward Thee, and verily Thou art the  Forgiver, the Lord of grace abounding.    O God, my God! I thirst for the celestial wine of Thy grace, and verily  Thou art the Giver, the Bountiful, the Gracious, the Almighty.    O God, my God! I testify that Thou hast revealed Thy Cause, fulfilled Thy  promise and sent down from the heaven of Thy grace that which hath drawn  unto Thee the hearts of Thy favored ones. Well is it with him that hath  held fast unto Thy firm cord and clung to the hem of Thy resplendent robe!    I ask Thee, O Lord of all being and King of the seen and unseen, by Thy  power, Thy majesty and Thy sovereignty, to grant that my name may be  recorded by Thy pen of glory among Thy devoted ones, them whom the scrolls  of the sinful hindered not from turning to the light of Thy countenance, O  prayer-hearing, prayer-answering God!    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Him Who is Thy Most  Great Name, Who hath been sorely afflicted by such of Thy creatures as  have repudiated Thy truth, and Who hath been hemmed in by sorrows which no  tongue can describe, to grant that I may remember Thee and celebrate Thy  praise, in these days when all have turned away from Thy beauty, have  disputed with Thee, and turned away disdainfully from Him Who is the  Revealer of Thy Cause. None is there, O my Lord, to help Thee except Thine  own Self, and no power to succor Thee save Thine own power.    I entreat Thee to enable me to cleave steadfastly to Thy love and Thy  remembrance. This is, verily, within my power, and Thou art the One that  knoweth all that is in me. Thou, in truth, art knowing, apprised of all.  Deprive me not, O my Lord, of the splendors of the light of Thy face,  whose brightness hath illuminated the whole world. No God is there beside  Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Praise be to Thee, O Lord, my Best Beloved!...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord, my Best Beloved! Make me steadfast in Thy  Cause, and grant that I may be reckoned among those who have not violated  Thy Covenant nor followed the gods of their own idle fancy. Enable me,  then, to obtain a seat of truth in Thy presence, bestow upon me a token of  Thy mercy and let me join with such of Thy servants as shall have no fear  nor shall they be put to grief. Abandon me not to myself, O my Lord, nor  deprive me of recognizing Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine Own Self,  nor account me with such as have turned away from Thy holy presence.  Number me, O my God, with those who are privileged to fix their gaze upon  Thy Beauty and who take such delight therein that they would not exchange  a single moment thereof with the sovereignty of the kingdom of heavens and  earth or with the entire realm of creation. Have mercy on me, O Lord, in  these days when the peoples of Thine earth have erred grievously; supply  me then, O my God, with that which is good and seemly in Thine estimation.  Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Gracious, the Bountiful, the  Ever-Forgiving.    Grant, O my God, that I may not be reckoned among those whose ears are  deaf, whose eyes are blind, whose tongues are speechless and whose hearts  have failed to comprehend. Deliver me, O Lord, from the fire of ignorance  and of selfish desire, suffer me to be admitted into the precincts of Thy  transcendent mercy and send down upon me that which Thou hast ordained for  Thy chosen ones. Potent art Thou to do what Thou willest. Verily, Thou art  the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    --The Bab        \"Praised and glorified art Thou, O God! Grant...\"      Praised and glorified art Thou, O God! Grant that the day of attaining Thy  holy presence may be fast approaching. Cheer our hearts through the  potency of Thy love and good-pleasure, and bestow upon us steadfastness  that we may willingly submit to Thy Will and Thy Decree. Verily, Thy  knowledge embraceth all the things Thou hast created or wilt create, and  Thy celestial might transcendeth whatsoever Thou hast called or wilt call  into being. There is none to be worshiped but Thee, there is none to be  desired except Thee, there is none to be adored besides Thee and there is  naught to be loved save Thy good-pleasure.    Verily, Thou art the supreme Ruler, the Sovereign Truth, the Help in  Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    --The Bab        \"O Lord my God! Assist Thy loved ones to be...\"      O Lord my God! Assist Thy loved ones to be firm in Thy Faith, to walk in  Thy ways, to be steadfast in Thy Cause. Give them Thy grace to withstand  the onslaught of self and passion, to follow the light of divine guidance.  Thou art the Powerful, the Gracious, the Self-Subsisting, the Bestower,  the Compassionate, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou, my God! Who guidest the seeker to...\"      O Thou, my God! Who guidest the seeker to the pathway that leadeth aright,  Who deliverest the lost and blinded soul out of the wastes of perdition,  Thou Who bestowest upon the sincere great bounties and favors, Who  guardest the frightened within Thine impregnable refuge, Who answerest,  from Thine all-highest horizon, the cry of those who cry out unto Thee.  Praised be Thou, O my Lord! Thou hast guided the distracted out of the  death of unbelief, and hast brought those who draw nigh unto Thee to the  journey's goal, and hast rejoiced the assured among Thy servants by  granting them their most cherished desires, and hast, from Thy Kingdom of  beauty, opened before the faces of those who yearn after Thee the gates of  reunion, and hast rescued them from the fire of deprivation and loss--so  that they hastened unto Thee and gained Thy presence, and arrived at Thy  welcoming door, and received of gifts an abundant share.    O my Lord, they thirsted, Thou didst lift to their parched lips the waters  of reunion. O Tender One, Bestowing One, Thou didst calm their pain with  the balm of Thy bounty and grace, and didst heal their ailments with the  sovereign medicine of Thy compassion. O Lord, make firm their feet on Thy  straight path, make wide for them the needle's eye, and cause them,  dressed in royal robes, to walk in glory for ever and ever.    Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Ever-Giving, the Precious, the Most  Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the  Exalted, the Victorious.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          GENERAL PRAYERS FOR TEACHING        \"Magnified be Thy name, O my God, for that...\"      Magnified be Thy name, O my God, for that Thou hast manifested the Day  which is the King of Days, the Day which Thou didst announce unto Thy  chosen Ones and Thy Prophets in Thy most excellent Tablets, the Day  whereon Thou didst shed the splendor of the glory of all Thy names upon  all created things. Great is his blessedness whosoever hath set himself  towards Thee, and entered Thy presence, and caught the accents of Thy  voice.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the name of Him round Whom circleth in  adoration the kingdom of Thy names, that Thou wilt graciously assist them  that are dear to Thee to glorify Thy word among Thy servants, and to shed  abroad Thy praise amidst Thy creatures, so that the ecstasies of Thy  revelation may fill the souls of all the dwellers of Thine earth.    Since Thou hast guided them, O my Lord, unto the living waters of Thy  grace, grant, by Thy bounty, that they may not be kept back from Thee; and  since Thou hast summoned them to the habitation of Thy throne, drive them  not out from Thy presence, through Thy loving-kindness. Send down upon  them what shall wholly detach them from aught else except Thee, and make  them able to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, in such wise that  neither the ascendancy of the oppressor nor the suggestions of them that  have disbelieved in Thy most august and most mighty Self shall be capable  of keeping them back from Thee.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore Thee, by Thy Name which none  hath befittingly recognized, and whose import no soul hath fathomed; I  beseech Thee, by Him Who is the Fountainhead of Thy Revelation and the  Dayspring of Thy signs, to make my heart to be a receptacle of Thy love  and of remembrance of Thee. Knit it, then, to Thy most great Ocean, that  from it may flow out the living waters of Thy wisdom and the crystal  streams of Thy glorification and praise.    The limbs of my body testify to Thy unity, and the hair of my head  declareth the power of Thy sovereignty and might.

Such is the station ordained for the true believer that if  to an extent smaller than a needle's eye the glory of that station were to  be unveiled to mankind, every beholder would be consumed away in his  longing to attain it. For this reason it hath been decreed that in this  earthly life the full measure of the glory of his own station should  remain concealed from the eyes of such a believer.\" \"If the veil be  lifted, and the full glory of the station of those who have turned wholly  towards God, and in their love for Him renounced the world, be made  manifest, the entire creation would be dumbfounded.\"    \"Verily I say! No one hath apprehended the root of this Cause. It is  incumbent upon everyone, in this day, to perceive with the eye of God, and  to hearken with His ear. Whoso beholdeth Me with an eye besides Mine own  will never be able to know Me. None among the Manifestations of old,  except to a prescribed degree, hath ever completely apprehended the nature  of this Revelation.\" \"I testify before God to the greatness, the  inconceivable greatness of this Revelation. Again and again have We, in  most of Our Tablets, borne witness to this truth, that mankind may be  roused from its heedlessness.\" \"How great is the Cause, how staggering the  weight of its Message!\" \"In this most mighty Revelation all the  Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their final  consummation.\" \"That which hath been made manifest in this preeminent,  this most exalted Revelation, stands unparalleled in the annals of the  past, nor will future ages witness its like.\" \"The purpose underlying all  creation is the revelation of this most sublime, this most holy Day, the  Day known as the Day of God, in His Books and Scriptures--the Day which all  the Prophets, and the Chosen Ones, and the holy ones, have wished to  witness.\" \"The highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever  the peoples of old have either said or written hath, through this most  potent Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the  All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding God.\" \"This is the Day in which God's  most excellent favors have been poured out upon men, the Day in which His  most mighty grace hath been infused into all created things.\" \"This is the  Day whereon the Ocean of God's mercy hath been manifested unto men, the  Day in which the Daystar of His loving-kindness hath shed its radiance  upon them, the Day in which the clouds of His bountiful favor have  overshadowed the whole of mankind.\" \"By the righteousness of Mine own  Self! Great, immeasurably great is this Cause! Mighty, inconceivably  mighty is this Day!\" \"Every Prophet hath announced the coming of this Day,  and every Messenger hath groaned in His yearning for this Revelation--a  revelation which, no sooner had it been revealed than all created things  cried out saying, 'The earth is God's, the Most Exalted, the Most Great!'\"  \"The Day of the Promise is come, and He Who is the Promised One loudly  proclaimeth before all who are in heaven and all who are on earth, 'Verily  there is none other God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!' I  swear by God! That which had been enshrined from eternity in the knowledge  of God, the Knower of the seen and unseen, is revealed. Happy is the eye  that seeth, and the face that turneth towards, the Countenance of God, the  Lord of all being.\" \"Great indeed is this Day! The allusions made to it in  all the sacred Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. The soul  of every Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this  wondrous Day. All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned  to attain it.\" \"This Day a door is open wider than both heaven and earth.  The eye of the mercy of Him Who is the Desire of the worlds is turned  towards all men. An act, however infinitesimal, is, when viewed in the  mirror of the knowledge of God, mightier than a mountain. Every drop  proffered in His path is as the sea in that mirror. For this is the Day  which the one true God, glorified be He, hath announced in all His Books,  unto His Prophets and His Messengers.\" \"This is a Revelation, under which,  if a man shed for its sake one drop of blood, myriads of oceans will be  his recompense.\" \"A fleeting moment, in this Day, excelleth centuries of a  bygone age.... Neither sun nor moon hath witnessed a day such as this  Day.\" \"This is the Day whereon the unseen world crieth out, 'Great is thy  blessedness, O earth, for thou hast been made the footstool of thy God,  and been chosen as the seat of His mighty throne.'\" \"The world of being  shineth, in this Day, with the resplendency of this Divine Revelation. All  created things extol its saving grace, and sing its praises. The universe  is wrapt in an ecstasy of joy and gladness. The Scriptures of past  Dispensations celebrate the great Jubilee that must needs greet this most  great Day of God. Well is it with him that hath lived to see this Day, and  hath recognized its station.\" \"This Day a different Sun hath arisen, and a  different Heaven hath been adorned with its stars and its planets. The  world is another world, and the Cause another Cause.\" \"This is the Day  which past ages and centuries can never rival. Know this, and be not of  the ignorant.\" \"This is the Day whereon human ears have been privileged to  hear what He Who conversed with God [Moses] heard upon Sinai, what He Who  is the Friend of God [Muhammad] heard when lifted up towards Him, what He  Who is the Spirit of God [Jesus] heard as He ascended unto Him, the Help  in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\" \"This Day is God's Day, and this Cause His  Cause.

Great is the blessedness of him who hath  attained, through the sweet savor of these days, unto everlasting life,  and who, with the most great steadfastness, hath arisen to aid the Cause  of Him Who is the King of Names. Such a man is as the eye to the body of  mankind.\" \"Peerless is this Day, for it is as the eye to past ages and  centuries, and as a light unto the darkness of the times.\" \"This Day is  different from other days, and this Cause different from other causes.  Entreat ye the one true God that He may deprive not the eyes of men from  beholding His signs, nor their ears from hearkening unto the shrill voice  of the Pen of Glory.\" \"These days are God's days, a moment of which ages  and centuries can never rival. An atom, in these days, is as the sun, a  drop as the ocean. One single breath exhaled in the love of God and for  His service is written down by the Pen of Glory as a princely deed. Were  the virtues of this Day to be recounted, all would be thunderstruck,  except those whom thy Lord hath exempted.\" \"By the righteousness of God!  These are the days in which God hath proved the hearts of the entire  company of His Messengers and Prophets, and beyond them those that stand  guard over His sacred and inviolable Sanctuary, the inmates of the  celestial Pavilion and dwellers of the Tabernacle of Glory.\" \"Should the  greatness of this Day be revealed in its fulness, every man would forsake  a myriad lives in his longing to partake, though it be for one moment, of  its great glory--how much more this world and its corruptible treasures!\"  \"God the true One is My Witness!
