It was evident to  me, therefore, that, if we should be involved in war, the odds against  us would be far greater than what was due merely to our inferiority in  population. Believing that secession would be the precursor of war  between the States, I was consequently slower and more reluctant than  others, who entertained a different opinion, to resort to that remedy.    While engaged in the consultation with the Governor just referred to, a  telegraphic message was handed to me from two members of Mr. Buchanan's  Cabinet, urging me to proceed \"immediately\" to Washington. This dispatch  was laid before the Governor and the members of Congress from the State  who were in conference with him, and it was decided that I should comply  with the summons. I was afterward informed that my associates considered  me \"too slow,\" and they were probably correct in the belief that I was  behind the general opinion of the people of the State as to the  propriety of prompt secession.[19]    On arrival at Washington, I found, as had been anticipated, that my  presence there was desired on account of the influence which it was  supposed I might exercise with the President (Mr. Buchanan) in relation  to his forthcoming message to Congress. On paying my respects to the  President, he told me that he had finished the rough draft of his  message, but that it was still open to revision and amendment, and that  he would like to read it to me. He did so, and very kindly accepted all  the modifications which I suggested. The message was, however, afterward  somewhat changed, and, with great deference to the wisdom and  statesmanship of its author, I must say that, in my judgment, the last  alterations were unfortunate--so much so that, when it was read in the  Senate, I was reluctantly constrained to criticise it. Compared,  however, with documents of the same class which have since been  addressed to the Congress of the United States, the reader of  Presidential messages must regret that it was not accepted by Mr.  Buchanan's successors as a model, and that his views of the Constitution  had not been adopted as a guide in the subsequent action of the Federal  Government.    The popular movement in the South was tending steadily and rapidly  toward the secession of those known as \"planting States\"; yet, when  Congress assembled on December 3, 1860 the representatives of the people  of all those States took their seats in the House, and they were all  represented in the Senate, except South Carolina, whose Senators had  tendered their resignation to the Governor immediately on the  announcement of the result of the Presidential election. Hopes were  still cherished that the Northern leaders would appreciate the impending  peril, would cease to treat the warnings, so often given, as idle  threats, would refrain from the bravado, so often and so unwisely  indulged, of ability \"to whip the South\" in thirty, sixty, or ninety  days, and would address themselves to the more manly purpose of devising  means to allay the indignation, and quiet the apprehensions, whether  well, founded or not, of their Southern brethren. But the debates of  that session manifest, on the contrary, the arrogance of a triumphant  party, and the determination to reap to the uttermost the full harvest  of a party victory.    Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky, the oldest and one of the most honored  members of the Senate,[20] introduced into that body a joint resolution  proposing certain amendments to the Constitution--among them the  restoration and incorporation into the Constitution of the geographical  line of the Missouri Compromise, with other provisions, which it was  hoped might be accepted as the basis for an adjustment of the  difficulties rapidly hurrying the Union to disruption. But the earnest  appeals of that venerable statesman were unheeded by Senators of the  so-called Republican party. Action upon his proposition was postponed  from time to time, on one pretext or another, until the last day of the  session--when seven States had already withdrawn from the Union and  established a confederation of their own--and it was then defeated by a  majority of one vote.[21]    Meantime, among other propositions made in the Senate were two  introduced early in the session, which it may be proper specially to  mention. One of these was a resolution offered by Mr. Powell, of  Kentucky, which, after some modification by amendment, when finally  acted upon, had taken the following form:        \"_Resolved_, That so much of the President's message as relates      to the present agitated and distracted condition of the country,      and the grievances between the slaveholding and the non-slave      holding States, be referred to a special committee of thirteen      members, and that said committee be instructed to inquire into      the present condition of the country, and report by bill or      otherwise.\"    The other was a resolution offered by Mr. Green, of Missouri, to the  following effect:        \"_Resolved_, That the Committee on the Judiciary be instructed      to inquire into the propriety of providing by law for      establishing an armed police force at all necessary points along      the line separating the slaveholding States from the      non-slaveholding States, for the purpose of maintaining the      general peace between those States, of preventing the invasion     of one State by citizens of another, and also for the efficient      execution of the fugitive-slave laws.\"    In the discussion of these two resolutions I find, in the proceedings of  the Senate on December 10th, as reported in the \"Congressional Globe,\"  some remarks of my own, the reproduction of which will serve to exhibit  my position at that period--a position which has since been often  misrepresented:        \"Mr. President, if the political firmament seemed to me dark      before, there has been little in the discussion this morning to      cheer or illumine it. When the proposition of the Senator from      Kentucky was presented--not very hopeful of a good result--I was      yet willing to wait and see what developments it might produce.      This morning, for the first time, it has been considered; and      what of encouragement have we received? One Senator proposes, as      a cure for the public evil impending over us, to invest the      Federal Government with such physical power as properly belongs      to monarchy alone; another announces that his constituents cling      to the Federal Government, if its legislative favors and its      Treasury secure the works of improvement and the facilities      which they desire; while another rises to point out that the      evils of the land are of a party character. Sir, we have fallen      upon evil times indeed, if the great convulsion which now shakes      the body-politic to its center is to be dealt with by such      nostrums as these. Men must look more deeply, must rise to a      higher altitude; like patriots they must confront the danger      face to face, if they hope to relieve the evils which now      disturb the peace of the land, and threaten the destruction of      our political existence.        \"First of all, we must inquire what is the cause of the evils      which beset us? The diagnosis of the disease must be stated      before we are prepared to prescribe. Is it the fault of our      legislation here? If so, then it devolves upon us to correct it,      and we have the power. Is it the defect of the Federal      organization, of the fundamental law of our Union? I hold that      it is not. Our fathers, learning wisdom from the experiments of      Rome and of Greece--the one a consolidated republic, and the      other strictly a confederacy--and taught by the lessons of our      own experiment under the Confederation, came together to form a      Constitution for 'a more perfect union,' and, in my judgment,      made the best government which has ever been instituted by man.      It only requires that it should be carried out in the spirit in      which it was made, that the circumstances under which it was      made should continue, and no evil can arise under this      Government for which it has not an appropriate remedy. Then it      is outside of the Government--elsewhere than to its Constitution      or to its administration--that we are to look. Men must not      creep in the dust of partisan strife and seek to make points      against opponents as the means of evading or meeting the issues      before us. The fault is not in the form of the Government, nor      does the evil spring from the manner in which it has been      administered. Where, then, is it? It is that our fathers formed      a Government for a Union of friendly States; and though under it      the people have been prosperous beyond comparison with any other      whose career is recorded in the history of man, still that Union      of friendly States has changed its character, and sectional      hostility has been substituted for the fraternity in which the      Government was founded.        \"I do not intend here to enter into a statement of grievances; I      do not intend here to renew that war of crimination which for      years past has disturbed the country, and in which I have taken      a part perhaps more zealous than useful; but I call upon all men      who have in their hearts a love of the Union, and whose service      is not merely that of the lip, to look the question calmly but      fully in the face, that they may see the true cause of our      danger, which, from my examination, I believe to be that a      sectional hostility has been substituted for a general      fraternity, and thus the Government rendered powerless for the      ends for which it was instituted. The hearts of a portion of the      people have been perverted by that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19846"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bulgaria\" to \"Calgary\" (#18)"],[1," bullion of commerce, and is a prime  element of value even in gold and silver plate, jewelry, and other articles  of manufacture. Bullion, whether in the form of coins, or of bars and  ingots stamped, is subject, as a general rule of the London market, not  only to weight but to assay, and receives a corresponding value.    BULLOCK, WILLIAM (c. 1657-c. 1740), English actor, \"of great glee and much  comic vivacity,\" was the original Clincher in Farquhar's _Constant Couple_  (1699), Boniface in _The Beaux' Stratagem_ (1707), and Sir Francis Courtall  in Pavener's _Artful Wife_ (1717). He played at all the London theatres of  his time, and in the summer at a booth at Bartholomew Fair. He had three  sons, all actors, of whom the eldest was Christopher Bullock (c.  1690-1724), who at Drury Lane, the Haymarket and Lincoln's Inn Fields  displayed \"a considerable versatility of talent.\" Christopher created a few  original parts in comedies and farces of which he was the author or  adapter:--_A Woman's Revenge_ (1715); _Slip_; _Adventures of Half an Hour_  (1716); _The Cobbler of Preston_; _Woman's a Riddle_; _The Perjurer_  (1717); and _The Traitor_ (1718).    BULLROARER, the English name for an instrument made of a small flat slip of  wood, through a hole in one end of which a string is passed; swung round  rapidly it makes a booming, humming noise. Though treated as a toy by  Europeans, the bullroarer has had the highest mystic significance and  sanctity among primitive people. This is notably the case in Australia,  where it figures in the initiation ceremonies and is regarded with the  utmost awe by the \"blackfellows.\" Their bullroarers, or sacred \"tunduns,\"  are of two types, the \"grandfather\" or \"man tundun,\" distinguished by its  deep tone, and the \"woman tundun,\" which, being smaller, gives forth a  weaker, shriller note. Women or girls, and boys before initiation, are  never allowed to see the tundun. At the Bora, or initiation ceremonies, the  bullroarer's hum is believed to be the voice of the \"Great Spirit,\" and on  hearing it the women hide in terror. A Maori bullroarer is preserved in the  British Museum, and travellers in Africa state that it is known and held  sacred there. Thus among the Egba tribe of the Yoruba race the supposed  \"Voice of Oro,\" their god of vengeance, is produced by a bullroarer, which  is actually worshipped as the god himself. The sanctity of the bullroarer  has been shown to be very widespread. There is no doubt that the rhombus  [Greek: rhombos] which was whirled at the Greek mysteries was one. Among  North American Indians it was common. At certain Moqui ceremonies the  procession of dancers was led by a priest who whirled a bullroarer. The  instrument has been traced among the Tusayan, Apache and Navaho Indians  (J.G. Bourke, _Ninth Annual Report of Bureau of Amer. Ethnol._, 1892),  among the Koskimo of British Columbia (Fr. Boas, \"Social Organization, &c.,  of the Kwakiutl Indians,\" _Report of the U.S. National Museum for 1895_),  and in Central Brazil. In New Guinea, in some of the islands of the Torres  Straits (where it is swung as a fishing-charm), in Ceylon (where it is used  as a toy and figures as a sacred instrument at Buddhist festivals), and in  Sumatra (where it is used to induce the demons to carry off the soul of a  woman, and so drive her mad), the bullroarer is also found. Sometimes, as  among the Minangkabos of Sumatra, it is made of the frontal bone of a man  renowned for his bravery.    See A. Lang, _Custom and Myth_ (1884); J.D.E. Schmeltz, _Das Schwirrholz_  (Hamburg, 1896); A.C. Haddon, _The Study of Man_, and in the _Journ.  Anthrop. Instit._ xix., 1890; G.M.C. Theal, _Kaffir Folk-Lore_; A.B.

BULL RUN, a small stream of Virginia, U.S.A., which gave the name to two  famous battles in the American Civil War.    (1) The first battle of Bull Run (called by the Confederates Manassas) was  fought on the 21st of July 1861 between the Union forces under  Brigadier-General Irvin McDowell and the Confederates under General Joseph  E. Johnston. Both armies were newly raised and almost untrained. After a  slight action on the 18th at Blackburn's Ford, the two armies prepared for  a battle. The Confederates were posted along Bull Run, guarding all the  passages from the Stone Bridge down to the railway bridge. McDowell's  forces rendezvoused around Centreville, and both commanders, sensible of  the temper of their troops, planned a battle for the 21st. On his part  McDowell ordered one of his four divisions to attack the Stone Bridge, two  to make a turning movement via Sudley Springs, the remaining division  (partly composed of regular troops) was to be in reserve and to watch the  lower fords. The local Confederate commander, Brigadier-General P.G.T.  Beauregard, had also intended to advance, and General Johnston, who arrived  by rail on the evening of the 20th with the greater part of a fresh army,  and now assumed command of the whole force, approved an offensive movement  against Centreville for the 21st; but orders miscarried, and the Federal  attack opened before the movement had begun. Johnston and Beauregard then  decided to fight a defensive battle, and hurried up troops to support the  single brigade of Evans which held the Stone Bridge. Thus there was no  serious fighting at the lower fords of Bull Run throughout the day.    [Illustration]    The Federal staff was equally inexperienced, and the divisions [v.04  p.0792] engaged in the turning movement met with many unnecessary checks.  At 6 A.M., when the troops told off for the frontal attack appeared before  the Stone Bridge, the turning movement was by no means well advanced. Evans  had time to change position so as to command both the Stone Bridge and  Sudley Springs, and he was promptly supported by the brigades of Bee,  Bartow and T.J. Jackson. About 9.30 the leading Federal brigade from Sudley  Springs came into action, and two hours later Evans, Bee and Bartow had  been driven off the Matthews hill in considerable confusion. But on the  Henry House hill Jackson's brigade stood, as General Bee said to his men,  \"like a stone wall,\" and the defenders rallied, though the Federals were  continually reinforced. The fighting on the Henry House hill was very  severe, but McDowell, who dared not halt to re-form his enthusiastic  volunteers, continued to attack. About 1.30 P.M. he brought up two regular  batteries to the fighting line; but a Confederate regiment, being mistaken  for friendly troops and allowed to approach, silenced the guns by close  rifle fire, and from that time, though the hill was taken and retaken  several times, the Federal attack made no further headway. At 2.45 more of  Beauregard's troops had come up; Jackson's brigade charged with the  bayonet, and at the same time the Federals were assailed in flank by the  last brigades of Johnston's army, which arrived at the critical moment from  the railway. They gave way at once, tired out, and conscious that the day  was lost, and after one rally melted away slowly to the rear, the handful  of regulars alone keeping their order. But when, at the defile of the Cub  Run, they came under shell fire the retreat became a panic flight to the  Potomac. The victors were too much exhausted to pursue, and the U.S.  regulars of the reserve division formed a strong and steady rearguard. The  losses were--Federals, 2896 men out of about 18,500 engaged; Confederates,  1982 men out of 18,000.    (2) The operations of the last days of August 1862, which include the  second battle of Bull Run (second Manassas), are amongst the most  complicated of the war. At the outset the Confederate general Lee's army  (Longstreet's and Jackson's corps) lay on the Rappahannock, faced by the  Federal Army of Virginia under Major-General John Pope, which was to be  reinforced by troops from McClellan's army to a total strength of 150,000  men as against Lee's 60,000. Want of supplies soon forced Lee to move,  though not to retreat, and his plan for attacking Pope was one of the most  daring in all military history. Jackson with half the army was despatched  on a wide turning movement which was to bring him via Salem and  Thoroughfare Gap to Manassas Junction in Pope's rear; when Jackson's task  was accomplished Lee and Longstreet were to follow him by the same route.  Early on the 25th of August Jackson began his march round the right of  Pope's army; on the 26th the column passed Thoroughfare Gap, and Bristoe  Station, directly in Pope's rear, was reached on the same evening, while a  detachment drove a Federal post from Manassas Junction. On the 27th the  immense magazines at the Junction were destroyed. On his side Pope had soon  discovered Jackson's departure, and had arranged for an immediate attack on  Longstreet. When, however, the direction of Jackson's march on Thoroughfare  Gap became clear, Pope fell back in order to engage him, at the same time  ordering his army to concentrate on Warrenton, Greenwich and Gainesville.  He was now largely reinforced. On the evening of the 27th one of his  divisions, marching to its point of concentration, met a division of  Jackson's corps, near Bristoe Station; after a sharp fight the Confederate  general, Ewell, retired on Manassas. Pope now realized that he had  Jackson's corps in front of him at the Junction, and at once took steps to  attack Manassas with all his forces. He drew off even the corps at  Gainesville for his intended battle of the 28th; McDowell, however, its  commander, on his own responsibility, left Ricketts's division at  Thoroughfare Gap. But Pope's blow was struck in the air. When he arrived at  Manassas on the 28th he found nothing but the ruins of his magazines, and  one of McDowell's divisions (King's) marching from Gainesville on Manassas  Junction met Jackson's infantry near Groveton.
