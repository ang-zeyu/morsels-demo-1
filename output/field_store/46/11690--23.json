Oh, I must be--I am a shameless little  hussy!\"    \"Hush thet kind of talk,\" said the old man, as he took her hand.  \"Ellen, you're only young an' lonely an' bitter.  No mother--no  friends--no one but a lot of rough men!  It's a wonder you hev kept  yourself good.  But now your eyes are open, Ellen.  They're brave an'  beautiful eyes, girl, an' if you stand by the light in them you will  come through any trouble.  An' you'll be happy.  Don't ever forgit  that.  Life is hard enough, God knows, but it's unfailin' true in the  end to the man or woman who finds the best in them an' stands by it.\"    \"Uncle John, y'u talk so--so kindly.  Yu make me have hope.  There  seemed really so little for me to live for--hope for.... But I'll never  be a coward again--nor a thoughtless fool.  I'll find some good in  me--or make some--and never fail it, come what will.  I'll remember  your words.  I'll believe the future holds wonderful things for me....  I'm only eighteen.  Shore all my life won't be lived heah.  Perhaps  this threatened fight over sheep and cattle will blow over....  Somewhere there must be some nice girl to be a friend--a sister to  me.... And maybe some man who'd believe, in spite of all they say--that  I'm not a hussy.\"    \"Wal, Ellen, you remind me of what I was wantin' to tell you when you  just got here.... Yestiddy I heerd you called thet name in a barroom.  An' thar was a fellar thar who raised hell.  He near killed one man an'  made another plumb eat his words.  An' he scared thet crowd stiff.\"    Old John Sprague shook his grizzled head and laughed, beaming upon  Ellen as if the memory of what he had seen had warmed his heart.    \"Was it--y'u?\" asked Ellen, tremulously.    \"Me?  Aw, I wasn't nowhere.  Ellen, this fellar was quick as a cat in  his actions an' his words was like lightnin'.'    \"Who? she whispered.    \"Wal, no one else but a stranger jest come to these parts--an Isbel,  too.  Jean Isbel.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Ellen, faintly.    \"In a barroom full of men--almost all of them in sympathy with the  sheep crowd--most of them on the Jorth side--this Jean Isbel resented  an insult to Ellen Jorth.\"    \"No!\" cried Ellen.  Something terrible was happening to her mind or her  heart.    \"Wal, he sure did,\" replied the old man, \"an' it's goin' to be good fer  you to hear all about it.\"        CHAPTER V    Old John Sprague launched into his narrative with evident zest.    \"I hung round Greaves' store most of two days.  An' I heerd a heap.  Some of it was jest plain ole men's gab, but I reckon I got the drift  of things concernin' Grass Valley.  Yestiddy mornin' I was packin' my  burros in Greaves' back yard, takin' my time carryin' out supplies from  the store.  An' as last when I went in I seen a strange fellar was  thar. Strappin' young man--not so young, either--an' he had on  buckskin.  Hair black as my burros, dark face, sharp eyes--you'd took  him fer an Injun. He carried a rifle--one of them new forty-fours--an'  also somethin' wrapped in paper thet he seemed partickler careful  about.  He wore a belt round his middle an' thar was a bowie-knife in  it, carried like I've seen scouts an' Injun fighters hev on the  frontier in the 'seventies.  That looked queer to me, an' I reckon to  the rest of the crowd thar.  No one overlooked the big six-shooter he  packed Texas fashion.  Wal, I didn't hev no idee this fellar was an  Isbel until I heard Greaves call him thet.    \"'Isbel,' said Greaves, 'reckon your money's counterfeit hyar. I cain't  sell you anythin'.'    \"'Counterfeit?  Not much,' spoke up the young fellar, an' he flipped  some gold twenties on the bar, where they rung like bells.  'Why not?  Ain't this a store?  I want a cinch strap.'    \"Greaves looked particular sour thet mornin'.  I'd been watchin' him  fer two days.  He hedn't hed much sleep, fer I hed my bed back of the  store, an' I heerd men come in the night an' hev long confabs with him.  Whatever was in the wind hedn't pleased him none.  An' I calkilated  thet young Isbel wasn't a sight good fer Greaves' sore eyes, anyway.  But he paid no more attention to Isbel.  Acted jest as if he hedn't  heerd Isbel say he wanted a cinch strap.    \"I stayed inside the store then.  Thar was a lot of fellars I'd seen,  an' some I knowed.  Couple of card games goin', an' drinkin', of  course. I soon gathered thet the general atmosphere wasn't friendly to  Jean Isbel.  He seen thet quick enough, but he didn't leave.  Between  you an' me I sort of took a likin' to him.  An' I sure watched him as  close as I could, not seemin' to, you know.  Reckon they all did the  same, only you couldn't see it.  It got jest about the same as if Isbel  hedn't been in thar, only you knowed it wasn't really the same.  Thet  was how I got the hunch the crowd was all sheepmen or their friends.  The day before I'd heerd a lot of talk about this young Isbel, an' what  he'd come to Grass Valley fer, an' what a bad hombre he was.  An' when  I seen him I was bound to admit he looked his reputation.    \"Wal, pretty soon in come two more fellars, an' I knowed both of them.  You know them, too, I'm sorry to say.  Fer I'm comin' to facts now thet  will shake you.  The first fellar was your father's Mexican foreman,  Lorenzo, and the other was Simm Bruce.  I reckon Bruce wasn't drunk,  but he'd sure been lookin' on red licker.  When he seen Isbel darn me  if he didn't swell an' bustle all up like a mad ole turkey gobbler.    \"'Greaves,' he said, 'if thet fellar's Jean Isbel I ain't hankerin' fer  the company y'u keep.'  An' he made no bones of pointin' right at  Isbel.  Greaves looked up dry an' sour an' he bit out spiteful-like:  'Wal, Simm, we ain't hed a hell of a lot of choice in this heah matter.  Thet's Jean Isbel shore enough.  Mebbe you can persuade him thet his  company an' his custom ain't wanted round heah!'    \"Jean Isbel set on the counter an took it all in, but he didn't say  nothin'.  The way he looked at Bruce was sure enough fer me to see thet  thar might be a surprise any minnit.  I've looked at a lot of men in my  day, an' can sure feel events comin'.  Bruce got himself a stiff drink  an' then he straddles over the floor in front of Isbel.    \"'Air you Jean Isbel, son of ole Gass Isbel?' asked Bruce, sort of  lolling back an' givin' a hitch to his belt.    \"'Yes sir, you've identified me,' said Isbel, nice an' polite.    \"'My name's Bruce.  I'm rangin' sheep heahaboots, an' I hev interest in  Kurnel Lee Jorth's bizness.'    \"'Hod do, Mister Bruce,' replied Isbel, very civil ant cool as you  please.  Bruce hed an eye fer the crowd thet was now listenin' an'  watchin'.  He swaggered closer to Isbel.    \"'We heerd y'u come into the Tonto Basin to run us sheepmen off the  range.  How aboot thet?'    \"'Wal, you heerd wrong,' said Isbel, quietly.  'I came to work fer my  father.  Thet work depends on what happens.'    \"Bruce began to git redder of face, an' he shook a husky hand in front  of Isbel.  'I'll tell y'u this heah, my Nez Perce Isbel--' an' when he  sort of choked fer more wind Greaves spoke up, 'Simm, I shore reckon  thet Nez Perce handle will stick.'  An' the crowd haw-hawed. Then Bruce  got goin' ag'in.  'I'll tell y'u this heah, Nez Perce. Thar's been  enough happen already to run y'u out of Arizona.'    \"'Wal, you don't say!  What, fer instance?, asked Isbel, quick an'  sarcastic.    \"Thet made Bruce bust out puffin' an' spittin': 'Wha-tt, fer instance?  Huh!  Why, y'u darn half-breed, y'u'll git run out fer makin' up to  Ellen Jorth.  Thet won't go in this heah country.  Not fer any Isbel.'    \"'You're a liar,' called Isbel, an' like a big cat he dropped off the  counter.  I heerd his moccasins pat soft on the floor.  An' I bet to  myself thet he was as dangerous as he was quick.  But his voice an' his  looks didn't change even a leetle.    \"'I'm not a liar,' yelled Bruce.  'I'll make y'u eat thet.  I can prove  what I say.... Y'u was seen with Ellen Jorth--up on the Rim--day before  yestiddy.  Y'u was watched.  Y'u was with her.  Y'u made up to her.  Y'u grabbed her an' kissed her! ... An' I'm heah to say, Nez Perce,  thet y'u're a marked man on this range.'    \"'Who saw me?' asked Isbel, quiet an' cold.  I seen then thet he'd  turned white in the face.    \"'Yu cain't lie out of it,' hollered Bruce, wavin' his hands. 'We got  y'u daid to rights.  Lorenzo saw y'u--follered y'u--watched y'u.'  Bruce pointed at the grinnin' greaser.  'Lorenzo is Kurnel Jorth's  foreman.  He seen y'u maulin' of Ellen Jorth.  An' when he tells the  Kurnel an' Tad Jorth an' Jackson Jorth! ... Haw!  Haw! Haw!  Why, hell  'd be a cooler place fer yu then this heah Tonto.'    \"Greaves an' his gang hed come round, sure tickled clean to thar  gizzards at this mess.  I noticed, howsomever, thet they was Texans  enough to keep back to one side in case this Isbel started any  action.... Wal, Isbel took a look at Lorenzo.  Then with one swift grab  he jerked the little greaser off his feet an' pulled him close.  Lorenzo stopped grinnin'.  He began to look a leetle sick.  But it was  plain he hed right on his side.    \"'You say you saw me?' demanded Isbel.    \"'Si, senor,' replied Lorenzo.    \"What did you see?'    \"'I see senor an' senorita.  I hide by manzanita.  I see senorita like  grande senor ver mooch.  She like senor keese.  She--'    \"Then Isbel hit the little greaser a back-handed crack in the mouth.  Sure it was a crack!  Lorenzo went over the counter backward an' landed  like a pack load of wood.  An' he didn't git up.    \"'Mister Bruce,' said Isbel, 'an' you fellars who heerd thet lyin'  greaser, I did meet Ellen Jorth.  An' I lost my head.  I 'I kissed  her.... But it was an accident.  I meant no insult.  I apologized--I  tried to explain my crazy action.... Thet was all.  The greaser lied.  Ellen Jorth was kind enough to show me the trail.  We talked a little.  Then--I suppose--because she was young an' pretty an' sweet--I lost my  head.

His large aquiline nose  points down to his short white beard, and on his head he wears a brown  turban. He is surrounded by five sons, also grey-bearded old men,  mounted on tall horses.    Now the performance began. The spectators rode to one side, leaving an  open space in front of us. A horseman dashed forward with a goat in his  arms, dismounted, and let the poor animal loose near to us. Another  Kirghiz seized the goat by the horn with his left hand, cut off its head  with a single blow of his sharp knife, allowed the blood to flow, and  then took the goat by the hind legs and rode at full speed round the  plain. A troop of riders appeared in the distance and drew near at a  furious pace. The hoofs of eighty horses beat the ground and the  deafening noise was mingled with wild cries and the rattle of stirrup  irons. They rushed swiftly past us in a cloud of dust, making a current  of air like a storm of wind. The first rider threw the dead goat, which  was still warm, in front of me, and then they whirled off like thunder  over the plain.    \"Ride back a little, sir,\" called out some chiefs, \"there will be wild  work now.\" We had hardly time to draw back far enough before the excited  troop came rushing along, with their horses in a lather, like an  avalanche from the mountains. Round the goat there was an inextricable  confusion of men and horses, only partially visible in the dust. They  were struggling for the goat, and the one who gets it is the winner.  They crush together and tear and push; horses shy, rear, or fall down,  while other horses leap over them. Holding on to their saddles the  horsemen bend down towards the ground and feel for the hide. Some have  fallen off and are in danger of being tramped upon, while others are  hanging half under their horses.    Still worse becomes the tumult when a couple of men on yaks push  themselves into the scrimmage. The yaks prod the horses' loins with  their horns. The horses are irritated and kick, and the yaks defend  themselves; then there is a perfect bullfight in full swing.    A strong fellow has now succeeded in getting a firm hold of the goat.  His horse knows what to do, and backs with his rider out of the  scrimmage and flies swiftly as the wind in a wide course round the  plain. The others pursue him, and as they turn back they look as if they  mean to ride over us with irresistible force. At the last moment,  however, the horses stop as if turned to stone; and then the struggle  begins again. Many have their faces covered with blood, others have  their clothes torn, caps and whips lie scattered over the arena, and one  or two horses are lamed.    \"It is very well for us who are old that we are not in the crush,\" I  said to Khoat Bek.    \"Ah, it is nearly a hundred years ago since I was as old as you are  now,\" the old man answered with a smile.    FOOTNOTES:    [8] A team of three horses abreast.    [9] The word \"darya\" means \"river.\"          VI    FROM PERSIA TO INDIA (1906)      TEBBES TO SEISTAN    Now we can return to Tebbes and continue our journey to India.    The camels are laden, we mount, the bells ring again, and our caravan  travels through the desert for days and weeks towards the south-east. At  length we come to the shore of a large lake called the Hamun, which lies  on the frontier between Persia and Afghanistan. The Amu-darya forms the  boundary between Bukhara and Afghanistan, the northern half of which is  occupied by the Hindu-kush mountains. The name means \"slaughterer of  Hindus,\" because Hindus who venture up among the mountains after the  heat of India have every prospect of being frozen to death in the  eternal snow. Large quantities of winter snow are melted in spring, and  then rivers and streams pour through the valleys to collect on the  plains of southern Afghanistan into a large river called the Hilmend,  which flows into the Hamun. As there are no proper boats or ferries on  the lake, we had here to take farewell of the camels who had served us  so faithfully and had carried us and our belongings through such long  stretches of desert. We were sorry to part with them, but there was  nothing for it but to sell them to the only dealer who would take them  off our hands.    Reeds and rushes grow in abundance along the flat shores of the Hamun,  but no trees. The natives build their huts of reeds, and also a curious  kind of boat. Handfuls of dry, yellow reeds of last year's growth are  tied together into cigar-shaped bundles, and then a number of such  bundles are bound together into a torpedo-like vessel several yards  long. When laden this reed boat floats barely four inches above the  water, but it can never be filled and made to sink by the waves. It is  true that the bundles of reeds might be loosened and torn apart by a  high sea, but the natives take good care not to go out in bad weather.    It took fourteen of these reed boats to accommodate our party and its  belongings. A half-naked Persian stood at the stern of each boat and  pushed the vessel along by means of a long pole, for the lake though  twelve miles broad is only five or six feet deep. A fresh breeze skimmed  the surface when we came out of the reeds into the open lake, and it was  very refreshing after weeks of the dry oppressive heat of the desert.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING JOURNEY FROM TEHERAN TO BALUCHISTAN  (pp. 46-54 and 72-81).]    After crossing the Hamun we had not more than a couple of hours' ride to  the capital of Seistan, Nasretabad. Five months before us another guest  had arrived, the plague; and just at the time the black angel of death  was going about in search of victims. He took the peasant from the  plough and the shepherd from his flock; and the fisherman, who in the  morning had gone cheerily to set his nets in the waters of the Hamun, in  the evening lay groaning in his hut with a burning fever.    Asia is the birth-place of the ruling peoples, the Aryans, and of the  yellow race; it is the cradle of the great religions, Buddhism,  Christianity, and Mohammedanism; and it is also the breeding-place of  fearful epidemic diseases which from time to time sweep over mankind  like devastating waves. Among these is the \"Black Death,\" the plague  which in the year 1350 carried off twenty-five millions of the people of  Europe. Men thought that it was a divine punishment. Some repented and  did penance; others gave themselves up to drunkenness and other  excesses. They had then no notion of the deadly bacteria, and of the  serum which renders the blood immune from their attacks.    In 1894 a similar wave swept from China through Hong Kong to India,  where three millions of human beings died in a few years. I remember a  small house in the poor quarter of Bombay which I visited in 1902. The  authorities had given orders that when any one died of the plague a red  cross should be painted beside the doorpost of the house. And this small  house alone had forty crosses.    And now in 1906 the plague had reached Seistan. From the roof of the  house where I lived with some English officers, we could see the  unfortunate people carrying out their dear ones to the grave. We could  see them wash the bodies in a pool outside the walls, and then resume  their sad procession. The population of the small town seemed in danger  of extermination, and at length the people fled in hundreds. An English  doctor and his assistant wished to help them by means of serum  injections, but the Mohammedan clergy, out of hatred of the Europeans,  made the people believe that it was the Christians who had let loose the  disease over the country. Deluded and excited, the natives gathered  together and made an attack on the British Consulate, but were repulsed.  Then they went back to their huts to die helplessly.    They tried as far as possible to keep the cases of death secret and  carried out the corpses at night. Soon the deaths were so frequent that  it was impossible to dig proper graves. Those, therefore, who thought of  the hyaenas and jackals, digged their own graves beforehand. Processions  round the mosque of the town were instituted, with black flags and a  sacrificial goat at the head, and the mercy of Allah was implored. But  Allah did not hear, and infection was spread among the people who  flocked together to the processions.    Under the microscope the deadly microbes appear only as quite small  elongated dots, though they are magnified twelve hundred times. They  live in the blood of rats, whose parasites communicate the infection to  human beings. It is therefore most important to exterminate all rats  when an outbreak of plague occurs. The disease is terribly infectious.  In a house where the angel of death descends and carries off a victim,  all the inmates die one after another. Stupidly blind, the natives did  not understand what was good for them, and could not be induced to burn  infected clothes and the whole contents of a plague-stricken house. They  would not part with their worldly goods and preferred to perish with  them.    In one house dwelt a poor carpenter with his wife, two half-grown sons  and a daughter. For two days the father had been oppressed by a feeling  of weakness, and then, his body burning with fever, he lay raving in a  corner on the floor of stamped earth. He was indifferent to everything  and wished only to be left in peace. If his wife threw a rug over him he  groaned, for the lymph glands, which swell up in large tumours, are  exceedingly painful. In a couple of days the microbes penetrate from the  tumour into the blood and the unfortunate man dies of blood poisoning.  The vermin under the man's clothes leave the body as soon as the blood  ceases to flow. Then is the danger greatest for the survivors who stand  mourning round the deathbed, for the vermin seek circulating blood and  carry infection from the corpse with them."]]]
