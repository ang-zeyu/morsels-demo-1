Well, what after?\"    \"Well, that made Glyn take my part, and he swung me behind him; and oh,  sir, he did give the big fellow such an awful thrashing!\"    \"Ha!\" said the Colonel, taking his great grey moustache by both hands  and drawing it out horizontally.  \"A thorough thrashing, eh?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And what were you doing?\"    \"Oh, I was seconding him, sir.\"    \"Oh, that was right.  You were not both on him at once?\"    \"Oh no, sir; it was all fair.\"    \"Then Glyn thoroughly whipped him, eh?\"    \"Yes, sir, thoroughly.\"    The Colonel turned to his son, and looked him over again; and then,  after another two-handed tug at his moustache, he said slowly:    \"I say, Glyn, old chap, you got it rather warmly.  But tut, tut, tut,  tut!  This won't do.  What did that old chap say: `Let dogs delight to  bark and bite'?  Here, I have been talking to the Doctor, and the Doctor  has been talking to me.  Look here, you, Singh, military fighting, after  proper discipline, and done by fighting men, is one thing; schoolboy  fighting is quite another, not for gentlemen.  It's low and  blackguardly.--Do you hear, Glyn?\" he cried turning on his son.  \"Blackguardly, sir--blackguardly.  Look at your faces, sir, and see how  you have got yourselves marked.  But er--er--\"    He picked his pocket-handkerchief up from where he had spread it over  his knees and blew another blast.  \"This er--this er--big fellow that  you thrashed--big disagreeable fellow--bit of a bully, eh?\"    \"Regular tyrant, father.  We hadn't been here a month, before not a day  passed without his insulting Singh or making us uncomfortable.\"    \"Ha! insulted Singh, did he?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" cried that individual through his set teeth.  \"He was always  calling me nigger, and mocking at me in some way.\"    \"Humph!  Brute!  And so, after putting up with a good deal, and obeying  my orders till he couldn't stand it any longer, Glyn took your part and  thrashed the fellow, eh?\"    \"Yes, sir, bravely,\" cried Singh, with his eyes flashing.  \"I wish you'd  been there to see.\"    \"I wish--\"    The Colonel stopped short.  \"No, no.  Tut, tut!  Nonsense!  I did not  want to see.  Here, hold out your hands, Glyn.  No, no, not like that.  Double your fists.  Hold them out straight.  I want to look at your  knuckles.  Dreadful!  Nice state for a gentleman's hands.  Fighting's  bad.--Do you hear, Singh?  Very bad.  But I must confess that I didn't  get through school without a turn-up or two myself.  Glyn took your  part, then, and thrashed the fellow.  Well, he won't bully either of you  again.  Yes, I got into my scrapes when I was a boy; but you know times  were different then.  Everything was rougher.  This sort of thing won't  do.  You must be more of gentlemen now--more polished.  Fighting's bad.\"    \"But you let the sergeant, father, teach us how to use the gloves after  you had got them over from England.\"    \"Eh?  What, sir--what sir?\" cried the Colonel sharply.  \"Well, yes, I  did.  It was a bit of a lapse, though, and every man makes mistakes.  But that, you see, was part of my old education, and through being in  India so many years and away from modern civilisation, and er--Of  course, I remember; it was after your poor father had been talking to  me, Singh, and telling me that he looked to me to make you a thorough  English gentleman, one fit to occupy his throne some day, and rule well  over his people--firmly, justly, and strongly, as an Englishman would.  And, of course, I thought it would be right for you both to know how to  use your fists if you were unarmed and attacked by ruffians.  And--er,  well, well, you see I was not quite wrong.  Mind, you know, I detest  fighting, and only this morning I have been quite agreeing with the  Doctor--fine old gentlemanly fellow, by the way, and a great scholar--  agreeing with him, I say, that this fighting is rather a disgrace.  At  the same time, my boys, as I was about to say, I was not quite wrong  about those gloves.  You see, it enabled Glyn here to bring skill to  bear against a bigger and a stronger man, and er--um--you see, there are  other kinds of fighting that a man will have to go through in life; and  then when such things do happen, mind this--I mean it metaphorically,  you know--when you do have to fight with your fists, or with your  tongue, thrash your adversary if you can; but if he from superior skill  or strength thrashes you, why then, take it like a man, shake hands, and  bear no malice against the one who wins.\"    The Colonel blew his nose again.    \"That's not quite what I wanted to say, my boys; but I shall think this  affair over a bit, and perhaps I shall have a few more words to say  by-and-by.\"    \"Oh, I say, dad--\" cried Glyn.    \"What do you mean by that, sir?\" said the Colonel sharply.    \"Finish it all now, and don't bring it up again.\"    \"Glyn!\" cried the Colonel sternly.    \"Yes, father.\"    \"Don't you dictate to me, sir.  I promised the Doctor that I would talk  to you both severely about this--this--well, piece of blackguardism,  ungentlemanly conduct, and I must keep my word.  But I will reserve the  rest till after dinner.\"    \"After dinner, father?\" cried Glyn eagerly.    \"Yes.  I have come down to stay at Plymborough for a few days at the  hotel, and I have told them there that I should have two gentlemen to  dine with me to-night, of course, if the Doctor gives his consent.\"    \"Oh, but look at us, sir!\" cried Singh.  \"We are in the infirmary, and  not fit to come.\"    \"Infirmary!\" said the Colonel scornfully.  \"Ha, ha!  You look infirm  both of you!\"    \"Oh, we don't feel much the matter, father,\" said Glyn; \"but look at  us.\"    \"Look at you, sir?  How can I help looking at you?  Yes, you do look  nice objects.\"    \"But we can't help it now, sir,\" said Singh, \"and we should like to  come.\"    \"Humph!  Yes, of course you'd like to come, my boy, and I want to have  you both to finish my lecture after I have thought it out a little more.  Well, look here, my lads; you are both bruised and--er--a bit  discoloured; but the world isn't obliged to know that it was done with  fists.  You might have been thrown off your horses or been upset in a  carriage accident.  Oh yes, it's no business of anybody else's.  I shall  ask the Doctor to let you come.\"    \"Oh, thank you, father!\" cried Glyn eagerly.  \"But I say, dad, you  didn't shake hands with Singh when we came in.\"    \"Well, no, boy; but--there, there, that's all right now.  You see I had  to listen to what the Doctor said.  Why, he tells me that you fellows  showed them all down here how to deal with a rowdy elephant.\"    \"Singh did, father.\"    \"Well done, boy!  You see, that's one great advantage in learning.  Nearly everything comes useful some time or other, and--There, let me  see,\" he continued, referring to his watch.  \"I must be off.  Visit too  long as it is.  Ring the bell, one of you.  I want to see the Doctor  again before I go.\"    \"And you will get us leave, sir?\" cried Singh, as he returned from  pulling at the bell.    \"Oh yes, I'll manage that.  Seven o'clock, boys, military time; and now  you both be off; but mind this, I am going to finish my lecture after  dinner, for I am not satisfied with what I said.  There, right about  face!  March!\"    As the boys reached the door the handle was turned and the Doctor  entered the room.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PAST.    \"Well, boys, glad to see you!  Did Dr Justinian say anything to you  about coming away to-night?\"    \"No, father; but--Dr Justinian--who do you mean?\"    \"Why, your law-maker and instructor.  He spoke very seriously to me  about breaking his laws and rules.  Well, here you are.  Come along.  The dining-room is this way.--I have been very busy since I saw you,  Singh.  I have seen the cook and given him a good talking to, and he has  promised us a regular Indian dinner, with curry.\"    The Colonel laid his hand on Singh's shoulder, and they passed out into  the hall of the hotel.    As they were crossing, Morris entered from the other side, nodded and  smiled to the boys, raised his hat to the Colonel, who stared at him,  and then passing on, went up to the office to speak to the manager.    \"Friend of yours, boys?\" said the Colonel.  \"Yes, father; one of our  masters.\"    \"Oh!  What brings him here?\"    \"I don't know, father.  Perhaps he thought you might ask him to dinner.\"    \"Ho!\" said the Colonel, with a snort.  \"Then he thought wrong.  Ah--but  one moment!  Would you like me to ask him, my boy?\"    \"Oh no,\" cried Glyn, with a look of dismay.  \"We want you all to  ourselves, father.\"    \"But you, Singh; would you like him to join us?\"    The boy shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.    \"No,\" he said; \"I think like Glyn does,\" and Singh clung in a boyish,  affectionate manner to the stalwart Colonel's arm, greatly to that  gentleman's satisfaction.    \"Then we will have our snug little dinner all to ourselves, boys, and a  good long talk about old times and the last news I have had from Dour.--  Yes, all right, waiter; serve the dinner at once, and mind everything is  very hot.--There you are: snug little table for three.  I'll sit this  side with my back to the light, and you two can sit facing it, so that I  can look at you both.\"    \"Oh, but that isn't fair, father,\" cried Glyn.  \"We ought to be with our  backs to the light.\"    \"Not at all, sir,\" said the Colonel, laughing.  \"A soldier should never  be ashamed of his scars.\"    The seats were taken, the dinner began, and had not proceeded far before  Glyn noticed that the waiter was staring very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#18)"],[1," lad,\" whispered the latter.  \"More chances than one.\"    \"Now then!  No whispering.  Come along!\" shouted the sinister-looking  man, fiercely.  \"Come on down.  Bring 'em along.\"    Don cast another despairing look at Jem, and then marched slowly toward  the opening in the floor.        CHAPTER FIFTEEN.    A DESPERATE ATTEMPT.    Just as the prisoners reached the trap-door a voice came from below.    \"Hold hard there, my lads.  Bosun Jones has been down to the others, and  he says these here may stop where they are.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Oh, one o' the four chaps we brought in last night's half wild, and  been running amuck.  Come on down.\"    \"Yah!\" growled the sinister sailor, scowling at Jem, as if there were  some old enmity between them.    \"I say, don't,\" said Jem mockingly.  \"You'll spoil your good looks.  Say, does he always look as handsome as that?\"    The man doubled his fist, and made a sharp blow at Jem, and seemed  surprised at the result; for Jem dodged, and retorted, planting his fist  in the fellow's chest, and sending him staggering back.    The man's eyes blazed as he recovered himself, and rushed at Jem like a  bull-dog.    Obeying his first impulse, Don, who had never struck a blow in anger  since he left school, forgot fair play for the moment, and doubled his  fists to help Jem.    \"No, no, Mas' Don; I can tackle him,\" cried Jem; \"and I feel as if I  should like to now.\"    But there was to be no encounter, for a couple of the other sailors  seized their messmate, and forced him to the trap-door, growling and  threatening all manner of evil to the sturdy little prisoner, who was  standing on his defence.    \"No, no, mate,\" said the biggest and strongest of the party; \"it's like  hitting a man as is down.  Come on.\"    There was another struggle, but the brute was half thrust to the ladder,  and directly after the trap was closed again, and the bolt shot.    \"Well, I never felt so much like fighting before--leastwise not since I  thrashed old Mike behind the barrel stack in the yard,\" said Jem,  resuming his coat, which he had thrown off.    \"Did you fight Mike in the yard one day?\" said Don wonderingly.  \"Why,  Jem, I remember; that's when you had such a dreadful black eye.\"    \"That's right, my lad.\"    \"And pretended you fell down the ladder out of floor number six.\"    \"That's right again, Mas' Don,\" said Jem, grinning.    \"Then that was a lie?\"    \"Well, I don't know 'bout it's being a lie, my lad.  P'r'aps you might  call it a kind of a sort of a fib.\"    \"Fib?  It was an untruth.\"    \"Well, but don't you see, it would have looked so bad to say, `I got  that eye a-fighting?' and it was only a little while 'fore I was  married.  What would my Sally ha' said if she know'd I fought our Mike?\"    \"Why, of course; I remember now, Mike was ill in bed for a week at the  same time.\"    \"That's so, Mas' Don,\" said Jem, chuckling; \"and he was werry ill.  You  see, he come to the yard to work, after you'd begged him on, and he was  drunk as a fiddler--not as ever I see a fiddler that way.  And then,  i'stead o' doing his work, he was nasty, and began cussing.  He cussed  everything, from the barrow and truck right up to your uncle, whose  money he took, and then he began cussing o' you, Mas' Don; and I told  him he ought to be ashamed of hisself for cussing the young gent as got  him work; and no sooner had I said that than I found myself sitting in a  puddle, with my nose bleeding.\"    \"Well?\" said Don, who was deeply interested.    \"Well, Mas' Don, that's all.\"    \"No, it isn't, Jem; you say you fought Mike.\"    \"Well, I s'pose I did, Mas' Don.\"    \"`Suppose you did'?\"    \"Yes; I only recklect feeling wild because my clean shirt and necktie  was all in a mess.  I don't recklect any more--only washing my sore  knuckles at the pump, and holding a half hun'erd weight up again my  eye.\"    \"But Mike stopped away from work for a week.\"    \"Yes, Mas' Don.  He got hisself a good deal hurt somehow.\"    \"You mean you hurt him?\"    \"Dunno, Mas' Don.  S'pose I did, but I don't 'member nothing about it.  And now look here, sir; seems to me that in half-hour's time it'll be  quite dark enough to start; and if I'd got five guineas, I'd give 'em  for five big screws, and the use of a gimlet and driver.\"    \"What for?\"    \"To fasten down that there trap.\"    \"It would be no good, Jem; because if they found the trap fast, they'd  be on the watch for us outside.\"    \"Dessay you're right, sir.  Well, what do you say?  Shall we begin now,  or wait?\"    Don looked up at the fast darkening skylight, and then, after a moment's  hesitation,--    \"Let's begin now, Jem.  It will take some time.\"    \"That's right, Mas' Don; so here goes, and good luck to us.  It means  home, and your mother, and my Sally; or going to fight the French.\"    \"And we don't want to be obliged to fight without we like, Jem.\"    \"That's true,\" said Jem; and going quickly to the trap, he laid his ear  to the crack and listened.    \"All right, my lad.  Have it out,\" he said; and the sacks were cast  aside, and the rope withdrawn.  \"Will it bear us, Jem?\"    \"I'm going to try first, and if it'll bear me it'll bear you.\"    \"But you can't get up there.\"    \"No, but you can, my lad; and when you're there you can fasten the rope  to that cross-bar, and then I can soon be with you.  Ready?\"    \"Wait till I've got off my shoes.\"    \"That's right; stick 'em in your pockets, my lad.  Now then, ready?\"    Don signified his readiness.  Jem laid him a back up at the end wall.  Don mounted, and then jumped down again.    \"What's the matter?\"    \"I haven't got the rope.\"    \"My: what a head I have!\" cried Jem, as Don tightly knotted the rope  about his waist; and then, mounting on his companion's back once more,  was borne very slowly, steadying himself by the sloping roof, till the  window was reached.    \"Hold fast, Jem.\"    \"Right it is, my lad.\"    There was a clicking of the iron fastening, the window was thrust up  higher and higher, till it was to the full extent of the ratchet  support, and then by passing one arm over the light cross-beam, which  divided the opening in two, Don was able to raise himself, and throw his  leg over the front of the opening, so that the next minute he was  sitting on the edge with one leg down the sloping roof, and the other  hanging inside, but in a very awkward position, on account of the broad  skylight.    \"Can't you open it more?\" said Jem.    \"No; that's as far as the fastening will hold it up.\"    \"Push it right over, Mas' Don, so as it may lie back against the roof.  Mind what you're doing, so as you don't slip.  But you'll be all right.  I've got the rope, and won't let it go.\"    Don did as he was told, taking tightly hold of the long cross central  bar, and placing his knees, and then his feet, against the front of the  opening, so that he was in the position of a four-footed animal.  Then  his back raised up the hinged skylight higher and higher, till, holding  on to the cross-bar with one hand, and the ratchet fastening with the  other, he thrust up and up, till the skylight was perpendicular, and he  paused, panting with the exertion.    \"All right, Mas' Don; I've got the rope.  Now lower it down gently, till  it lies flat on the slope.  That's the way; steady!  Steady!\"    _Bang_! _crash_! _jingle_!    \"Oh, Mas' Don!\"    \"I couldn't help it, Jem; the iron fastening came out.  The wood's  rotten.\"    For the skylight had fallen back with a crash, and some of the broken  glass came musically jingling down, some of it sliding along the tiles,  and dropping into the alley below.    There was a dead silence, neither of the would-be evaders of the  enforced king's service moving, but listening intently for the slightest  sound.    \"Think they heared it, Mas' Don?\" said Jem, at last, in a hoarse  whisper.    \"I can't hear anything,\" replied Don, softly.    They listened again, but all was wonderfully quiet.  A distant murmur  came from the busy streets, and a clock struck nine.    \"Why, that's Old Church,\" said Jem in a whisper.  \"We must be close down  to the water side, Mas' Don.\"    \"Yes, Jem.  Shall we give it up, or risk it?\"    \"I'll show you d'reckly,\" said Jem.  \"You make that there end fast round  the bar.  It isn't rotten, is it?\"    \"No,\" said Don, after an examination; \"it seems very solid.\"  And  untying the rope from his waist, he knotted it to the little beam.    The next minute Jem gave a heavy drag at the rope, then a jerk, and next  swung to it, going to and fro for a few seconds.    \"Hold a ton,\" whispered Jem; and reaching up as high as he could, he  gripped the rope between his legs and over his ankle and foot, and  apparently with the greatest ease drew himself up to the bar, threw a  leg over and sat astride with his face beaming.    \"They sha'n't have us this time, Mas' Don,\" he said, running the rope  rapidly through his hands until he had reached the end, when he gathered  it up in rings, till he had enough to throw beyond the sloping roof.    \"Here goes!\" he whispered; and he tossed it from him into the gathering  gloom.    The falling rope made a dull sound, and then there was a sharp gliding  noise.    One of the broken fragments of glass had been started from where it had  lodged, and slid rapidly down the tiles.    They held their breath as they waited to hear it fall tinkling beyond on  the pavement; but they listened in vain, for the simple reason that it  had fallen into the gutter.    \"All right, Mas' Don!  Here goes!\" said Jem, and he lowered the rope to  its full extent.    \"Hadn't I better go first, and try the rope, Jem?\"    \"What's the good o' your going first?  It might break, and then what  would your mother say to me?  I'll go; and, as I said afore, if it bears  me, it'll bear you.\"    \"But, if it breaks, what shall I say to little Sally?\"    \"Well, I wouldn't go near her if I was you, Mas' Don.  She might take  on, and then it wouldn't be nice; or she mightn't take on,"]]]
