All at once the door opened, and a little man entered,  and said, \"Good evening, my pretty miller's daughter why are you  weeping so bitterly?\"    \"Ah!\" answered the maiden, \"I must spin straw into gold, and know not  how to do it.\"    The little man said, \"What will you give me if I do it for you?\"    \"My neckerchief,\" said the maiden.    He took the kerchief, sat down before the wheel, and grind, grind,  grind--three times did he grind--and the spindle was full: then he put  another thread on, and grind, grind, grind, the second was full; so he  spun on till morning; when all the straw was spun, and all the  spindles were full of gold.    The king came at sunrise, and was greatly astonished and overjoyed at  the sight; but it only made his heart the more greedy of gold. He put  the miller's daughter into another much larger room, full of straw,  and ordered her to spin it all in one night, if life were dear to her.  The poor helpless maiden began to weep, when once more the door flew  open, the little man appeared, and said, \"What will you give me if I  spin this straw into gold?\"    \"My ring from my finger,\" answered the maiden.    The little man took the ring, began to turn the wheel, and, by the  morning, all the straw was spun into shining gold.    The king was highly delighted when he saw it, but was not yet  satisfied with the quantity of gold; so he put the damsel into a still  larger room, full of straw, and said, \"Spin this during the night; and  if you do it, you shall be my wife.\" \"For,\" he thought, \"if she's only  a miller's daughter I shall never find a richer wife in the whole  world.\"    As soon as the damsel was alone, the little man came the third time,  and said, \"What will you give me if I again spin all this straw for  you?\"    \"I have nothing more to give you,\" answered the girl.    \"Then promise, if you become queen, to give me your first child.\"    \"Who knows how that may be, or how things may turn out between now and  then?\" thought the girl, but in her perplexity she could not help  herself: so she promised the little man what he desired, and he spun  all the straw into gold.    When the king came in the morning, and saw that his orders had been  obeyed, he married the maiden, and the beautiful miller's daughter  became a queen. After a year had passed she brought a lovely baby into  the world, but quite forgot the little man, till he walked suddenly  into her chamber, and said, \"Give me what you promised me.\" The queen  was frightened, and offered the dwarf all the riches of the kingdom if  he would only leave her her child; but he answered, \"No; something  living is dearer to me than all the treasures of the world.\"    Then the queen began to grieve and to weep so bitterly, that the  little man took pity upon her and said, \"I will give you three days;  if in that time you can find out my name, you shall keep the child.\"    All night long the queen thought over every name she had ever heard,  and sent a messenger through the kingdom, to inquire what names were  usually given to people in that country. When, next day, the little  man came again, she began with Caspar, Melchoir, Balthazar, and  repeated, each after each, all the names she knew or had heard of; but  at each one the little man said, \"That is not my name.\"    The second day she again sent round about in all directions, to ask  how the people were called, and repeated to the little man the  strangest names she could hear of or imagine: to each he answered  always, \"That is not my name.\"    The third day the messenger returned and said, \"I have not been able  to find a single new name; but as I came over a high mountain by a  wood, where the fox and the hare bid each other good-night, I saw a  little house, and before the house was burning a little fire, and  round the fire danced a very funny little man, who hopped upon one  leg, and cried out:--        \"To-day I brew, to-morrow I bake,      Next day the queen's child I shall take;      How glad I am that nobody knows      My name is Rumpelstilzchen!\"    You may guess how joyful the queen was at hearing this; and when, soon  after, the little man entered and said, \"Queen, what is my name?\" she  asked him mischievously, \"Is your name Kunz?\"    \"No.\"    \"Is your name Carl?\"    \"No.\"    \"Are you not sometimes called Rumpelstilzchen?\"    \"A witch has told you that--a witch has told you!\" shrieked the poor  little man, and stamped so furiously with his right foot that it sunk  into the earth up to the hip; then he seized his left foot with both  hands with such violence, that he tore himself right in two.          FORTUNATUS.      In the city of Famagosta, in the island of Cyprus, there lived a very  rich gentleman. His name was Theodorus: he married a lady who was the  greatest beauty in Cyprus, and she was as rich as himself; she was  called Graciana. They both had every pleasure that wealth could buy,  and lived in the first style. Besides all this, the lady Graciana  brought her husband a fine little son, who was named Fortunatus; so  one would think nothing could have kept Theodorus from being the most  happy person in the world. But this was not long the case; for when he  had enjoyed all these pleasures for some time, he grew tired of them,  and began to keep company with young noblemen of the court, with whom  he sat up all night drinking and playing cards, so that in a few years  he spent all his fortune. He was now very sorry for what he had done,  but it was too late; and there was nothing he could do, but to work at  some trade to support his wife and child. For all this the lady  Graciana never found fault with him, but still loved her husband the  same as before; saying, \"Dear Theodorus, to be sure I do not know how  to work at any trade; but if I can not help you in earning money, I  will help you to save it.\" So Theodorus set to work; and though the  lady Graciana had always been used only to ring her bell for  everything that she wanted, she now scoured the kettles and washed the  clothes with her own hands.    They went on in this manner till Fortunatus was sixteen years of age.  When that time came, one day, as they were all sitting at dinner,  Theodorus fixed his eyes on his son, and sighed deeply.    \"What is the matter with you, father?\" said Fortunatus.    \"Ah! my child,\" said Theodorus, \"I have reason enough to be sorry,  when I think of the noble fortune which I have spent, and that my  folly will force you to labour for your living.\"    \"Father,\" replied Fortunatus, \"do not grieve about it. I have often  thought that it was time I should do something for myself; and though  I have not been brought up to any trade, yet I hope I can contrive to  support myself somehow.\"    When Fortunatus had done his dinner, he took his hat and walked to the  sea-side, thinking of what he could do, so as to be no longer a burden  to his parents. Just as he reached the sea-shore, the Earl of  Flanders, who had been to Jerusalem, was embarking on board his ship  with all his servants, to set sail for Flanders. Fortunatus now  thought he would offer himself to be the Earl's page. When the Earl  saw that he was a smart-looking lad, and heard the quick replies which  he made to his questions, he took him into his service; so at once  they all went on board. On their way the ship stopped a short time at  the port of Venice, where Fortunatus saw many strange things, which  made him wish still more to travel, and taught him much that he did  not know before.    Soon after this they came to Flanders; and they had not been long on  shore, before the Earl, his master, was married to the daughter of the  Duke of Cleves. The wedding was kept with all sorts of public  feasting, and games on horseback, called tilts, which lasted many  days; and, among the rest, the Earl's lady gave two jewels as prizes  to be played for, each of them the value of a hundred crowns. One of  them was won by Fortunatus, and the other by Timothy, a servant of the  Duke of Burgundy; who afterwards ran another tilt with Fortunatus, so  that the winner was to have both the jewels. So they tilted, and, at  the fourth course, Fortunatus hoisted Timothy a full spear's length  from his horse, and thus won both the jewels, which pleased the Earl  and Countess so much that they praised Fortunatus, and thought better  of him than ever. At this time, also, Fortunatus had many rich  presents given him by the lords and ladies of the court. But the high  favour shown him made his fellow-servants jealous, and one, named  Robert, who had always pretended a great friendship for Fortunatus,  made him believe that for all his seeming kindness, the Earl, in  secret, envied him his great skill in tilting. Robert said, too, that  he had heard the Earl give private orders to one of his servants to  find some way of killing him next day, while they should all be out  hunting.    Fortunatus thanked the wicked Robert for what he thought a great  kindness; and the next day, at daybreak, he took the swiftest horse in  the Earl's stables, and left the country. When the Earl heard that  Fortunatus had gone away in a hurry, he was much surprised, and asked  all his servants what they knew about the matter, but they all denied  knowing anything of it, or why he had left them. The Earl then said,  \"Fortunatus was a lad for whom I had a great esteem; I am sure some of  you must have given him an affront; if I discover it, I shall not fail  to punish the guilty person.\" In the meantime, Fortunatus, when he  found himself out of the Earl's country, stopped at an inn to refresh  himself, and began to reckon how much he had about him. He took out  all his fine clothes and jewels, and could not help putting them on.  He then looked at himself in the glass, and thought that, to be sure,  he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19737"],[0,"The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture, Elucidated (#18)"],[1,"below that one double the  size for the deacon and sub-deacon; both are under recessed arched  canopies. Quadruple sedilia occur in the churches of Turvey and Luton,  Bedfordshire; in the Mayor's Chapel, Bristol; in Gloucester Cathedral; in  the church of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire; and in Rothwell Church,  Northamptonshire: these are beneath canopies, and most of them are highly  enriched. Quintuple sedilia sometimes occur, but are very rare; in the  conventual church of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, are, however, five  sedilia beneath ogee-headed canopies richly ornamented. A single sedile  for one person only is occasionally met with, but not often.    [Illustration: Double Piscina, Salisbury Cathedral.]    Eastward of the sedilia, in the same wall, is a _fenestella_ or niche,  sometimes plain, but often enriched with a crocketed ogee or pedimental  hood moulding in front, over the arch, which is trefoiled or cinquefoiled  in the head. This niche contains a hollow perforated basin or stone drain,  called the _piscina_ or _lavacrum_[186-*], into which it appears that  after the priest had washed his hands, which he was accustomed to do  before the consecration of the elements and again after the communion,  the water was poured, as also that with which the chalice was rinsed. The  usage of washing the hands before the communion is one of very high  antiquity, and is expressly noticed in the Clementine Liturgy, and by St.  Cyril in his mystical Catechesis[187-*]; we do not, however, find the  piscina in our churches of an era earlier than the twelfth century, and  even then it was of uncommon occurrence; but in the thirteenth century the  general introduction is observable. In Romsey Church, Hampshire, is the  shaft and basin (the latter cushion-shaped) of a curious Norman piscina:  this is now lying loose, in a dilapidated state. In the south apsis of the  same church is another Norman piscina, consisting of a quadrangular-shaped  basin projecting from the south wall; and on the south side of the chancel  of Avington Church, Berkshire, is a plain Norman piscina within a simple  semicircular arched recess. The churches of Kilpeck, Herefordshire,  Keelby, Lincolnshire, and Bapchild, Kent, also contain Norman piscinae.  Those of all the various styles of later date are common; they exhibit,  however, an interesting variety in design and ornamental detail. The drain  of the piscina communicated with a perforated stone shaft, commonly  enclosed in the wall, through which the water was lost in the earth; as in  the case of the piscina with its shaft taken out of the south wall of the  chancel of the now destroyed church of Newnham Regis, Warwickshire.  Sometimes a piscina was a subsequent addition to a structure of early  date, as in the old and now demolished church of Stretton-upon-Dunsmore,  Warwickshire, in the south wall of the Norman chancel of which a piscina  of the latter part of the thirteenth century had been inserted.    [Illustration: Piscina, Newnham Regis, Warwickshire.]    The piscina is very common in churches even where the sedilia or stone  seats are wanting, and not only in the chancel, but also in the south  walls at the east end of the north and south aisles, and in mortuary  chapels, as will be presently noticed; it appears, in short, to have been  an indispensable appendage to an altar.    Sometimes the piscina is double, and contains two basins with drains, the  one for receiving the water in which the hands had been washed, the other  for the reception of the water with which the chalice was rinsed after the  communion[189-*]. In Rothwell Church, Northamptonshire, on the south side  of the chancel, are the vestiges of a triple piscina; the fenestella has  been destroyed, but the three basins with their drains remain.    Across the _fenestella_, or niche which contains the piscina, a shelf of  stone or wood may be frequently found: this was the _credence_[190-*], or  table on which the chalice, paten, ampullae, and other things necessary for  the celebration of mass were, before consecration, placed in a state of  readiness on a clean linen cloth; and this originated from the prothesis,  or side table of preparation, used in the early church; a recurrence to  which ancient and primitive custom by some of the divines of the Anglican  church, after the Reformation, occasioned great offence to be taken by the  Puritan seceders. In some instances a side table of stone or wood was used  for this purpose; and a fine credence table of stone, the sides of which  are covered with panelled compartments, is still remaining on the south  side of the choir, St. Cross Church, near Winchester[190-+].    [Illustration: Ambrie or Locker, Chaddesden Church, Derbyshire.]    The credence table, or shelf above the piscina, must not be confounded  with the _ambrie_ or _locker_, a small square and plain recess usually  contained in the east or north wall, near the altar. In this the chalice,  paten, and other articles pertaining to the altar were kept when not in  use. The wooden doors formerly affixed to these ambries have for the most  part either fallen into decay or been removed, but traces of the hinges  may be frequently perceived; and a locker in the north wall of the chancel  of Aston Church, Northamptonshire, still retains the two-leaved wooden  door. Sometimes shelves are set across the lockers. In the east wall of  Earls Barton Church, Northamptonshire, is a large locker divided into two  unequal parts by a stone shelf inserted in it; and in the north aisle of  Salisbury Cathedral are two large triangular-headed lockers or ambries,  each which[TN-5] contains two shelves.    Within the north wall of the chancel, near the altar, a large arch, like  that of a tomb, may often be perceived; within this the _holy sepulchre_,  generally a wooden and movable structure, was set up at Easter, when  certain rites commemorative of the burial and resurrection of our Lord  were anciently performed with great solemnity; for on Good Friday the  crucifix and host were here deposited, and watched the following day and  nights; and early on Easter morning they were removed from thence with  great ceremony, and replaced on the altar by the priest. In the accounts  of churchwardens of the fifteenth and early part of the sixteenth century  we meet with frequent notices of payments made for watching the sepulchre  at Easter[192-*]. Sometimes the sepulchre was altogether of stone, and a  fixture, and enriched with architectural and sculptured detail, as in the  well-known specimen at Heckington, Lincolnshire, and the fine specimen of  tabernacle-work in Stanton Harcourt Church, Oxfordshire.    At the back of the high altar was affixed a reredos, or screen of  tabernacle-work, costly specimens of which contained small images set on  brackets under projecting canopies; an alabaster table or sculptured bas  relief, placed just over the altar, was also common. The high altar  reredos is still remaining, though in a mutilated condition, in the Abbey  Church, St. Alban's; it was erected A. D. 1480, and is perhaps the most  splendid specimen we have; and in Bristol Cathedral a portion of the high  altar reredos is also left. The chantry altar reredos is more frequently  remaining, even where the altar and alabaster table[193-*] above have been  destroyed; rarely, however, in a perfect state. In the seventeenth century  the rich tabernacle-work was sometimes plastered over, probably to  preserve it from iconoclastic violence. In many of our cathedrals, as at  Gloucester, Bristol, Wells, and Worcester, and in some of the chantries  attached to Henry the Seventh's Chapel, Westminster, specimens of the  chantry reredos screen, which appear to have abounded more or less with  sculptured and architectural detail, are to be met with; and remains of  the painting and gilding with which they were anciently covered may in  some instances be traced. In a Survey of the Priory Church, Bridlington,  taken at the suppression, we find noticed, \"The Reredose at the highe  alter representyng Criste at the assumpcyon of our Lady and the XII.  appostells, w^t. dyvers other great imagys, beyng of a great heyght, ys  excellently well wrought, and as well gylted.\" Five small chapels are also  mentioned, \"w^t. fyve alters and small tables of alleblaster and imag's.\"  Sometimes, however, the space behind the altar was occupied by a painted  altar-piece, on wood or panel; a curious but mutilated specimen of which,  of the latter part of the fifteenth century, is still preserved in the  conventual church, Romsey.    Over the high altar was the great east window of the church, glazed with  painted glass; other windows in the church were also thus filled. The  subjects pourtrayed on the glass were sometimes scriptural, sometimes  legendary. Single figures of saints, distinguished by their peculiar  symbols, are common; figures of crowned heads, prelates, and warriors also  frequently occur; and on some windows are depicted the arms and sometimes  even the portraits of different benefactors to the church, with scrolls  bearing inscriptions. We have, perhaps, few remains of ancient stained  glass in our churches of a period antecedent to the thirteenth century: of  this era, probably, are those curious circular designs which fill the  greater portion of the lights at the back of the sedilia in Dorchester  Church, Oxfordshire: one representing St. Augustine and St. Birinus, the  first bishop of that ancient see; another, a priest and deacon, the former  with the host, the latter bearing the ampullae. Of this period also is some  ancient stained glass in Chetwood Church, Bucks, the ground of which is  covered with a kind of mosaic pattern, a usual feature in the more ancient  stained glass, and the borders partake of a tendril foliage; whilst in  pointed oval-shaped compartments, forming the well-known symbol _vesica  piscis_, are single figures of saints "]]]
