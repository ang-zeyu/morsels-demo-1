[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#18)"],[1,"all the pueblos, occupied or in ruins, within the provinces of  Tusayan and Cibola, Walpi exhibits the widest departure from the typical  pueblo arrangement (Pl. XX).    The carelessness characteristic of Tusayan architecture seems to have  reached its culmination here. The confused arrangement of the rooms,  mainly due to the irregularities of the site, contrasts with the work at  some of the other villages, and bears no comparison with much of the  ancient work. The rooms seem to have been clustered together with very  little regard to symmetry, and right angles are very unusual. (See Fig.  8.)    The general plan of the village of to-day confirms the traditional  accounts of its foundation. According to these its growth was gradual,  beginning with a few small clusters, which were added to from time to  time as the inhabitants of the lower site upon the spur of the mesa,  where the mission was established, moved up and joined the pioneers on  the summit. It is probable that some small rooms or clusters were built  on this conspicuous promontory soon after the first occupation of this  region, on account of its exceptionally favorable position as an outlook  over the fields (Pl. XXI).    Though the peculiar conformation of the site on which the village has  been built has produced an unusual irregularity of arrangement, yet even  here an imperfect example of the typical inclosed court may be found,  at one point containing the principal kiva or ceremonial chamber of the  village. It is probable that the accidental occurrence of a suitable  break or depression in the mesa top determined the position of this kiva  at an early date and that the first buildings clustered about this  point.      [Illustration: Fig. 8. Topography of the site of Walpi.]    A unique feature in this kiva is its connection with a second  subterranean chamber, reached from the kiva through an ordinary doorway.  The depression used for the kiva site must have been either larger than  was needed or of such form that it could not be thrown into one  rectangular chamber. It was impossible to ascertain the form of this  second room, as the writer was not permitted to approach the connecting  doorway, which was closed with a slab of cottonwood. This chamber, used  as a receptacle for religious paraphernalia, was said to connect with an  upper room within the cluster of dwellings close by, but this could not  be verified at the time of our visit. The plan indicates that such an  adjoining chamber, if of average size, could easily extend partly under  the dwellings on either the west or south side of the court. The rocky  mesa summit is quite irregular in this vicinity, with rather an abrupt  ascent to the passageway on the south as shown in Pl. XXII. Southeast  from the kiva there is a large mass of rocks projecting above the  general level, which has been incorporated into a cluster of dwelling  rooms. Its character and relation to the architecture may be seen in Pl.  XXIII. So irregular a site was not likely to be built upon until most of  the available level surface had been taken up, for even in masonry of  much higher development than can be found in Tusayan the builders,  unable to overcome such obstacles as a large mass of protruding rock,  have accommodated their buildings to such irregularities. This is very  noticeable in the center cluster of Mummy Cave (in Canyon del Muerto,  Arizona), where a large mass of sandstone, fallen from the roof of the  rocky niche in which the houses were built, has been incorporated into  the house cluster. Between this and another kiva to the north the mesa  top is nearly level. The latter kiva is also subterranean and was built  in an accidental break in sandstone. On the very margin of this fissure  stands a curious isolated rock that has survived the general erosion of  the mesa. It is near this rock that the celebrated Snake-dance takes  place, although the kiva from which the dancers emerge to perform the  open air ceremony is not adjacent to this monument (Pl. XXIV).      [Illustration: Plate XXVII. Mashongnavi with Shupaulovi in distance.]    A short distance farther toward the north occur a group of three more  kivas. These are on the very brink of the mesa, and have been built in  recesses in the crowning ledge of sandstone of such size that they could  conveniently be walled up on the outside, the outer surface of rude  walls being continuous with the precipitous rock face of the mesa.    The positions of all these ceremonial chambers seem to correspond with  exceptionally rough and broken portions of the mesa top, showing that  their location in relation to the dwelling clusters was due largely to  accident and does not possess the significance that position does in  many ancient pueblos built on level and unencumbered sites, where the  adjustment was not controlled by the character of the surface.    The Walpi promontory is so abrupt and difficult of access that there is  no trail by which horses can be brought to the village without passing  through Hano and Sichumovi, traversing the whole length of the mesa  tongue, and crossing a rough break or depression in the mesa summit  close to the village. Several foot trails give access to the village,  partly over the nearly perpendicular faces of rock. All of these have  required to be artificially improved in order to render them  practicable. Plate XXV, from a photograph, illustrates one of these  trails, which, a portion of the way, leads up between a huge detached  slab of sandstone and the face of the mesa. It will be seen that the  trail at this point consists to a large extent of stone steps that have  been built in. At the top of the flight of steps where the trail to the  mesa summit turns to the right the solid sandstone has been pecked out  so as to furnish a series of footholes, or steps, with no projection or  hold of any kind alongside. There are several trails on the west side of  the mesa leading down both from Walpi and Sichúmovi to a spring below,  which are quite as abrupt as the example illustrated. All the water used  in these villages, except such as is caught during showers in the  basin-like water pockets of the mesa top, is laboriously brought up  these trails in large earthenware canteens slung over the backs of the  women.    Supplies of every kind, provisions, harvested crops, fuel, etc., are  brought up these steep trails, and often from a distance of several  miles, yet these conservative people tenaciously cling to the  inconvenient situation selected by their fathers long after the  necessity for so doing has passed away. At present no argument of  convenience or comfort seems sufficient to induce them to abandon their  homes on the rocky heights and build near the water supply and the  fields on which they depend for subsistence.    One of the trails referred to in the description of Hano has been  converted into a wagon road, as has been already described. The Indians  preferred to expend the enormous amount of labor necessary to convert  this bridle path into a wagon road in order slightly to overcome the  inconvenience of transporting every necessary to the mesa upon their own  backs or by the assistance of burros. This concession to modern ideas is  at best but a poor substitute for the convenience of homes built in the  lower valleys.      [Illustration: Fig. 9. Mashongnavi and Shupaulovi from Shumopavi.]    MASHONGNAVI.    Mashongnavi, situated on the summit of a rocky knoll, is a compact  though irregular village, and the manner in which it conforms to the  general outline of the available ground is shown on the plan.  Convenience of access to the fields on the east and to the other  villages probably prompted the first occupation of the east end of this  rocky butte (Pl. XXVI).      [Illustration: Plate XXVIII. Back wall of a Mashongnavi house-row.]      [Illustration: Fig. 10. Diagram showing growth of Mashongnavi.]    In Mashongnavi of to-day the eastern portion of the village forms a more  decided court than do the other portions. The completeness in itself of  this eastern end of the pueblo, in connection with the form of the  adjoining rows, strongly suggests that this was the first portion of the  pueblo built, although examination of the masonry and construction  furnish but imperfect data as to the relative age of different portions  of the village. One uniform gray tint, with only slight local variations  in character and finish of masonry, imparts a monotonous effect of  antiquity to the whole mass of dwellings. Here and there, at rare  intervals, is seen a wall that has been newly plastered; but,  ordinarily, masonry of 10 years' age looks nearly as old as that built  200 years earlier. Another feature that suggests the greater antiquity  of the eastern court of the pueblo is the presence and manner of  occurrence here of the kiva. The old builders may have been influenced  to some extent in their choice of site by the presence of a favorable  depression for the construction of a kiva, though this particular  example of the ceremonial room is only partly subterranean. The other  kivas are almost or quite below the ground level. Although a favorable  depression might readily occur on the summit of the knoll, a deep  cavity, suitable for the construction of the subterranean kiva, would  not be likely to occur at such a distance from the margin of the  sandstone ledge. The builders evidently preferred to adopt such half-way  measures with their first kiva in order to secure its inclosure within  the court, thus conforming to the typical pueblo arrangement. The  numerous exceptions to this arrangement seen in Tusayan are due to local  causes. The general view of Mashongnavi given in Pl. XXVII shows that  the site of this pueblo, as well as that of its neighbor, Shupaulovi,  was not particularly defensible, and that this fact would have weight in  securing adherence in the first portion of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#18)"],[1,"of Byzantine influence which had passed over Germany by the  time of Henry II. had immensely benefited the Germans. We notice it  especially in the miniatures of the Gospel-books. The technic is much  more masterly, the painting really methodical in soundly worked  body-colour with a delicate sense of harmony, and showing no longer that  coarse handling and slovenliness of execution that marks some of the  Carolingian miniatures. In the figure a sense of proportion has been  gained, the tendency, perhaps, being rather to excessive tallness, as  compared with the thick-set proportions of the Carolingian work. Again,  expression is improved--the faces are more intellectual--not beautiful  but strong, and quite superior to the utterly expressionless faces of  the Carolingian type.    Take, for example, that fine Missal now at Munich (Cimel. 60--Lat.  4456), in which St. Henry, who is bearded, receives his crown from a  bearded Christ, his arms being upheld by two bishops, Ulrich of Augsburg  and Emmeram of Regensburg, the two great saints of Bavaria. We know  these to be the personages represented, because two inscriptions tell us  so. To the one supporting the King's right hand: \"Huius VODALRICVS cor  regis signet et actus.\" To the other: \"EMMERANVS ei faveat solamine  dulci.\" The Christ is seated on a rainbow within a cusped aureola or  \"amande\" of several bands of different colours, on the central one being  inscribed in a mixture of Greek and Latin characters--one of the new  fashions brought in by the Greek revival:        \"Clemens XPE tuo longum da vivere XPIC to:       Ut tibi devotus non perdat temporis usus.\"    Some writers have thought this to be a picture of the Emperor's  apotheosis, and that the crown is that of Life or Immortality; but such  is certainly not the import of the above verses.        \"O gentle Christ give to thy Christ long to live       That devoted to Thee he may not lose the use of time.\"    Besides, two angels on either side Christ precipitately bestow on the  Emperor the spear and sword of a temporal sovereignty. Round the Emperor  are the words: \"Ecce coronatur divinitus atque beatur. Rex pius  Heinricus proavorum stirp(e) polosus,\" all which can scarcely refer to  anything but his German Empire.    The expression, \"give to thy Christ,\" is an allusion to the Hebrew usage  of calling the king the \"anointed\" or the \"Christ.\"    Besides the interest possessed by this MS. as a monument of the art of  its own time, it has a special value resting in the fact that its  illuminations were copied from the famous Emmeram Golden Gospels of  Charles the Bald, written by Linthard and Berenger, and sent as a  present to Regensburg. Another illumination in it, representing the  enthronement of the Emperor, is extremely interesting as showing how the  later artist renders the work of the earlier one. The general  composition is precisely the same, the lower figures in the same  attitudes and bearing the same insignia. But in the details of costume,  and in the significant position of the Emperor, there are alterations.  In the miniature of the Emmeram Gospels the two angels above are simply  winged messengers of the usual biblical type; in the Missal they are  cloaked and crowned and bear horns in their hands. In the older MS. the  two crowned figures with horns on either side wear simple mural crowns;  in the later one they are regal like those of the Emperor. The details  also of the canopies are different. But the remarkable difference is  that while Charles the Bald is beardless and bears nothing in his hands,  merely sitting as if addressing an assembly, Henry II. holds in his  right hand a sceptre and in his left an orb and cross. Here is a  distinctly new feature with a meaning. Here are the symbols of authority  in the Emperor's own hands, and not merely in those of his  attendants.[27] These two MSS. are worthy of careful study.    [27] See p. 92.    In another Missal in the library at Bamberg is a miniature of the  Emperor presenting the book to the Virgin. In the great Evangeliary  presented by the Emperor Henry II. to the Cathedral of Bamberg there is  a grand picture of the Emperor and his consort the famous saint  Cunegunda being crowned by Christ, with SS. Peter and Paul standing at  the sides. Here also, as in the Carolingian MS. already mentioned, are  the nations bringing tribute, but not in the same order. Here Germany  stands upright between two figures of Gaul and Rome, while six others  appear simply as busts (Munich, Cimel. 60. 4456).    The twelfth century was clearly much given to symbolism and allegory, as  shown in apocalyptic commentaries and similar works. A very remarkable  \"Apocalypse\" is that in the library of the Marquis d'Astorga. The latter  is remarkably rich in pictures, which have been described by M.A.  Bachelin of Paris. The drawing in these pictures reminds one of the  bas-reliefs of the campaigns of Hadrian and Trajan and other work of the  early Roman centuries. One hundred and ten miniatures of uncommon  interest constitute the illustrations, many of which are perfect  curiosities of symbolism, depicting not only the four figures of the  evangelists, but the mysteries of the seals and vials, serpents, beasts,  etc., on yellow, red, green, blue, and brown backgrounds. The draperies  in some of the miniatures show Byzantine teaching, but with the  grandiose style of the early Roman times. The MS. it might be compared  with of the twelfth century is the \"Hortus Deliciarum\" of the Abbess  Herrade. This latter MS., which unfortunately was burnt with many other  treasures during the siege of Strassburg by the Germans in 1870, was a  veritable treasury of mediæval customs, furniture, and costumes,  illustrating a medley of encyclopædic information for the use of the  nuns and secular students of the Abbey of Hohenburg in Alsace. The good  abbess called her book a \"Garden of Delights.\"    It is known that it dated from 1159, as that date and also the date of  1175 occurred in its pages. We do not know whether the authoress was  also the illuminatrix, but at any rate she directed the illumination.  Their style is of the same type as that of the Apocalypse just spoken  of, somewhat monumental as figures of the Liberal Arts, allegorical  figures of the virtues and vices, and the syrens as symbols of sensual  temptation. There was a figure of the Church riding upon a beast with  the four heads of the evangel-symbols--the sun and moon in chariots as  in the classical mythology, and scenes of warfare, marriage festivities,  banquets, everything indeed depicting the life of contemporary  persons.[28] The drawing and treatment generally is of no very skilful  kind--the colouring bright and in body-colour. Draperies as usual much  folded and fluttering, and the heads generally of the calm expression of  the later French school, but the action sometimes very spirited.    [28] For a copious and exhaustive account of the \"Hortus,\" see \"Het  Gildeboek,\" Utrecht, 1877, v. i. Also Engelhardt, Herrad v. H., etc.,  8°, with atlas of twelve plates, 1818.    The title began thus: \"Incipit hortus deliciarum, in quo collectis  floribus scripturarum assidue jucundetur turmula adolescentularum.\" In  the _Rhytmus_ came the lines:--                 \"Salve cohors virginum                Hohenburgensium                Albens quasi lilium                Amans dei filium                  Herrat devotissima                Tua fidelissima                Mater et ancillula                Cantat tibi cantica                  Sic et liber utilis                Tibi delectabilis                Et non cesses volvere                Hanc in tuo pectore.\"    In the Netherlands, which mostly at this time lay within the boundary of  Lotharingia or Lorraine, the style of illumination was much the same as  in other German districts. Gospel-books and Psalters, however, exhibit  features somewhat akin to English work.    In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the continental methods prevail in  more solid painting and less penwork.    Of the twelfth-century work of Germany examples are exceedingly  numerous, stretching over every province from West to East, as  Westphalia, the Palatinate, Burgundy, Switzerland and Bavaria, extending  even into Bohemia. An Evangeliary in the University Library at Prag  agrees altogether with those of Germany.    Towards the middle of the twelfth century, with the accession of the  House of Hohenstaufen (1138, etc.), arose a new style, since called  Romanesque, of which many examples are to be found in various libraries.  It is not very easy to select the most typical examples, but one good  and typical MS. is found in a Gospel-book at Carlsruhe, which contains  some capital miniatures of this most thoroughly German style.    Under Frederick Barbarossa, as under the Caroling Emperors and the  Othos, we may note a wave of new life, especially in Saxony. A contrast  as regards artistic ability to the \"Hortus Deliciarum\" is the  Gospel-book executed for Henry the Lion at the convent of Helmershausen,  once in the Cathedral Library at Prag, and bought by King George of  Hanover.[29] In the page of the Eusebian Canons we see features which  take us across the plains of Lombardy to the doors of S. Michele of  Pavia, and to the churches of Venice. The columns rest on crouching  animals. Allegorical figures are introduced striving with each other as  in the later Gothic illuminations. A half-nude figure of Faith  vanquishes the champion of Paganism. On the dedication page sits the  Madonna with SS. John Baptist and Bartholomew, and below them the patron  saints of Brunswick, Blaize, and Egidius leading forth the Duke and his  wife, Mathilda. It may indeed be called a splendid book. Among the rest  of the pictures, some of them within richly decorated borders, occurs  the usual representation of the Duke and his Duchess receiving crowns.  The figures are well drawn, even"]]]
