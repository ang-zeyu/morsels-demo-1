The nervousness of the Boers at any  seeming threat to their line of retreat has been so obvious as to  elicit frequent comment. As a predominant motive it is ruinous.    The loss of the British at Graspan was 16 {p.152} killed, 169  wounded. Lord Methuen noted in his report that he had fought  distinctly different Boers on the two occasions. If he was not  mistaken, this helps to account for the greatly increased numbers  encountered three days later at Modder River. At Kimberley also it had  been observed that the number of the besiegers was now much  diminished, and a report, substantially correct, was received there  that Cronje was marching south with 3,000 men. These, with the two  bodies already fought, would bring the Boer force up to the 8,000  estimated by Methuen to be present at the next action, of November 28.  The Kimberley garrison did not fail to occupy the attention of their  besiegers by frequent sorties, one in considerable strength occurring  on the day of the Modder River fight; but such measures, however  commendable, cannot beyond a certain point impose upon a sagacious  commander with good information, and Cronje well knew that to stop  Methuen was his principal affair.    The British force rested two days after Graspan, and at 4 A.M. of  November 28 resumed {p.153} its northward march. Methuen's  information had led him to believe that the Modder was not held in  force, and that he would meet his next serious opposition at  Spytfontein, where the Boers would make their last stand; the country  between it and Kimberley, a dozen miles further on, being open and  unfavourable to their defensive tactics. Reckoning upon this, he first  intended, taking five days' rations, to make a circuit eastward by way  of Jacobsdaal, crossing the Modder higher up, and coming in upon  Spytfontein from that direction. The railroad, protected by  earthworks, was to be left under guard of one or two thousand men. On  the very eve of starting, intelligence came in that Modder River  Station was strongly occupied, and the general, fearing under that  condition to risk the railroad, decided to advance direct upon the  river. He was still ignorant, and even unsuspicious, that the enemy  had massed to the number of 8,000 to oppose the passage of the 7,000  to which casualties and the care of lengthening communications had  reduced his own division.    The {p.154} position taken by the Boers was on the south bank of the  Modder, at the point where it is joined by the Riet. The two streams,  flowing respectively from east and south-east, inclose an angle of  forty-five degrees, the ground between them being called an island,  though not so properly. The railroad crosses by a bridge--by this time  destroyed--just below the junction; Modder River Station, a small,  pleasant village, being on the north bank. In the approach from the  south, by which the British were advancing, the land--or veldt--slopes  evenly and regularly downward to the river, rising again beyond in  such wise that the island is higher than the southern bank, but is in  turn commanded by the northern.    Cronje had intrenched his riflemen along a line of three miles of the  river bed, by which they were entirely concealed. On the island, which  is covered with trees and brush, he had placed sharpshooters and  quick-firing guns. On the extreme Boer right their position was  further strengthened by broken, rocky ground and small kopjes,  considerably in advance of their line. This forward {p.155} cover  they held by a strong detachment, as they did also another slight  eminence, six hundred yards further east, upon which was a farm-house  and kraal. From these a cross-fire upon the enemy served to protect  their right flank, which by position otherwise was the weaker.    Although unconscious that he was about to encounter numbers equal to,  if not greater than his own, Methuen, who expected them to retire  after a show of opposition, considered it still his best course to  advance with his two brigades on an extended front, the Guards on the  right, the 9th Brigade on the left, the two carefully keeping touch  from end to end and crossing in that order. Thus approaching, at 8.10  A.M. a very heavy fire showed that the river was held in force and  caused numerous casualties, many men falling at once. \"The Scots Guard  Maxim detachment were completely wiped out.\" On the British  right--Boer left--there was no break in the even slope of the ground,  the Guards were visible for three miles from the river, and fully  exposed alike to the fire of the trenches and that from the island;  but the latter, {p.156} without solid cover, was in turn closely  searched by the British batteries, which, massed principally upon the  right of their line, threw in the action over three thousand rounds.  Under such heavy fire the Guards were directed to extend to the right,  at the same time swinging round their extreme right companies toward  the left. It was hoped thus to outflank and enfilade the hostile line;  but the movement was checked by the Riet, which, contrary to the  intelligence received, was not fordable. Colonel Codrington with a  score of officers and men did get across; but the water was too deep  for support to follow, and in returning some of the party were nearly  drowned, having to hold hands to stem the force of the current. There  was nothing for the right wing but to lie down when they had got  within 1,100 yards of the enemy, and then patiently to await an  outcome. Accordingly they thus remained from 10 A.M. until the sun  went down at 6.20; the fire never ceasing, yet for all its intensity  causing few casualties while the men lay quiet. \"No one,\" wrote  Methuen, in his report, \"could get on a horse with any {p.157} safety  within 2,000 yards of the enemy.\" Under these conditions the  conveyance of orders to different parts of the line was much  embarrassed.    The left of the British front extended some distance west of the  railroad. Here a rising ground, parallel to the river course,  concealed the troops in their advance until its summit was reached,  but there the same withering fire checked them. About 2 in the  afternoon, however, two companies of light infantry succeeded by a  rush in carrying the farm-house in front of the Boer lines, and almost  at the same moment another detachment dislodged the enemy from the  advanced kopjes on his extreme right. The parties thus established so  threatened the Boers' flank as to shake their position.    An attempt was next made to gain and pass the river by a ford, which  lies behind the farm-house, but this was too near the strength of the  hostile fire and the effort was repelled. On their furthest left the  British had better success. There the advanced kopjes supported the  movement, and there the enemy's fire was weakest. A place deep  {p.158} but passable was found, and the Boers' right flank was turned  under a heavy fire of infantry supported by a battery. First a party  of twenty crossed, under Colonel Barter, of the Yorkshire Light  Infantry--the names of all the men who do such a deed should be  remembered, but their leader at least may be mentioned. Three or four  hundred followed, and fixed themselves on the north bank, winning the  outskirts of the village. Thence an advance of three-quarters of a  mile up the river-side was made, the general of the brigade having now  crossed; but this ground could not be held, and the British were  forced back. Reinforcements were sent, and in performing this service  Methuen's chief-of-staff, Colonel Northcott, was killed, the battle  raging along the front in full severity. When the fire ceased at dark,  the Boers still occupied their trenches, but the British were firmly  settled upon their right flank and rear, on the north bank, and had  possession of a practicable ford. During the night the Boers evacuated  their positions, and the field of battle remained with the British,  who continued to hold the line of the river {p.159} up to the time  that Roberts began his advance.    The battle of the Modder showed that, with the modern improvements in  rapid-firing arms, it is possible for troops well entrenched over an  extended front to sweep a plain field of approach with such a volume  of fire as is impossible to cross. This it shows, but otherwise the  lessons to be derived have been greatly exaggerated. Witnesses exhaust  their descriptive powers to portray the evidences of the innumerable  falls of bullets, shown by the kicking up of the dust. \"A fire so  thick and fearful that no man can imagine how any one passed under or  through it. Many crippled lay flat for hours, not daring to rise for  succour. If any one asked a comrade for a drink of water, he saw the  bottle, or the hand passing it, pierced by a Dum-Dum or a one-pounder  shell. If he raised his head to writhe in his pain, he felt his helmet  shot away.\"[13]                       [Footnote 13: Julian Ralph, \"Toward Pretoria,\" p.                     153.]    The impression produced by the scene is most forcibly betrayed by the  exaggerated phrase of the veteran commander in his first  telegram--\"One of the hardest and most trying {p.160} fights in the  annals of the British Army.\" Yet, as far as result was concerned, it  was an immense expenditure of ammunition and little loss of life. The  frontal attack was so clearly impossible that it was at once  abandoned, and the men lay down. A generation or two ago they would  have persisted, many more would have been killed, and while the  position might at last have been carried in front, more than likely it  would at the last have been turned, as it was at the Modder. The  British loss, 70 killed, 413 wounded, was but 7 per cent. of the  troops engaged--about 7,000--far below that of many of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#18)"],[1,"Bishop heard of  his arrival, and put forty assassins on his track. But Israel was a man  of many wiles as well as a man of God. He assumed disguises, and changed  his clothes so as to baffle pursuit, appearing now as an officer, now  as a coachman, now as a cook. He presented himself at the castle of the  noble family of the Ostrorogs, was warmly welcomed by the Countess, and  held a service in her rooms. The Count was absent, heard the news, and  came in a state of fury. He seized a whip. \"I will drag my wife out  of this conventicle,\" he exclaimed; and burst into the room while the  service was proceeding, his eyes flashing fire and the whip swinging in  his hand. The preacher, Cerwenka, calmly went on preaching. \"Sir,\" said  George Israel, pointing to an empty seat \"sit down there.\" The Count  of Ostrorog meekly obeyed, listened quietly to the discourse, became  a convert that very day, turned out his own Lutheran Court Chaplain,  installed George Israel in his place, and made a present to the Brethren  of his great estate on the outskirts of the town.    For the Brethren the gain was enormous. As the news of the Count's  conversion spread, other nobles quickly followed suit. The town of  Ostrorog became the centre of a swiftly growing movement; the poor  Brethren in Prussia returned to Poland, and found churches ready for  their use; and before seven years had passed away the Brethren had  founded forty congregations in this their first land of exile.    They had, however, another great mission to fulfil. As the Brethren  spread from town to town, they discovered that the other Protestant  bodies--the Lutherans, Zwinglians and Calvinists--were almost as fond  of fighting with each other as of denouncing the Church of Rome; and  therefore the people, longing for peace, were disgusted more or less  with them all. But the Brethren stood on a rather different footing.  They were cousins to the Poles in blood; they had no fixed and definite  creed; they thought far more of brotherly love than of orthodoxy in  doctrine; and therefore the idea was early broached that the Church of  the Brethren should be established as the National Church of Poland.  The idea grew. The Lutherans, Zwinglians, Calvinists and Brethren drew  closer and closer together. They exchanged confessions, discussed each  other's doctrines, met in learned consultations, and held united synods  again and again. For fifteen years the glorious vision of a union of all  the Protestants in Poland hung like glittering fruit just out of reach.  There were many walls in the way. Each church wanted to be the leading  church in Poland; each wanted its own confession to be the bond of  union; each wanted its own form of service, its own form of government,  to be accepted by all. But soon one and all began to see that the time  had come for wranglings to cease. The Jesuits were gaining ground in  Poland. The Protestant Kingdom must no longer be divided against itself.    At last the Brethren, the real movers of the scheme, persuaded all to  assemble in the great United Synod of Sendomir, and all Protestants in  Poland felt that the fate of the country depended on the issue of the  meeting {1570.}. It was the greatest Synod that had ever been held in  Poland. It was an attempt to start a new movement in the history of the  Reformation, an attempt to fling out the apple of discord and unite all  Protestants in one grand army which should carry the enemy's forts by  storm. At first the goal seemed further off than ever. As the Calvinists  were the strongest body, they confidently demanded that their Confession  should be accepted, and put forward the telling argument that it was  already in use in the country. As the Lutherans were the next strongest  body, they offered the Augsburg Confession, and both parties turned  round upon the Brethren, and accused them of having so many Confessions  that no one knew which to take. And then young Turnovius, the  representative of the Brethren, rose to speak. The Brethren, he said,  had only one Confession in Poland. They had presented that Confession to  the King; they believed that it was suited best to the special needs  of the country, and yet they would accept the Calvinists' Confession as  long as they might keep their own as well.    There was a deadlock. What was to be done? The Brethren's work seemed  about to come to nought. Debates and speeches were in vain. Each party  remained firm as a rock. And then, in wondrous mystic wise, the tone of  the gathering softened.    \"For God's sake, for God's sake,\" said the Palatine of Sendomir in his  speech, \"remember what depends upon the result of our deliberations,  and incline your hearts to that harmony and love which the Lord has  commanded us to follow above all things.\"    As the Palatine ended his speech he burst into tears. His friend, the  Palatine of Cracow, sobbed aloud. Forthwith the angry clouds disparted  and revealed the bow of peace, the obstacles to union vanished, and the  members of the Synod agreed to draw up a new Confession, which should  give expression to the united faith of all. The Confession was prepared  {April 14th.}. It is needless to trouble about the doctrinal details.  For us the important point to notice is the spirit of union displayed.  For the first, but not for the last, time in the history of Poland the  Evangelical Protestants agreed to sink their differences on points of  dispute, and unite their forces in common action against alike the power  of Rome and the Unitarian[40] sects of the day. The joy was universal. The  scene in the hall at Sendomir was inspiring. When the Committee laid the  Confession before the Synod all the members arose and sang the Ambrosian  Te Deum. With outstretched hands the Lutherans advanced to meet the  Brethren, and with outstretched hands the Brethren advanced to meet the  Lutherans. The next step was to make the union public. For this purpose  the Brethren, a few weeks later, formed a procession one Sunday morning  and attended service at the Lutheran Church; and then, in the afternoon,  the Lutherans attended service in the Church of the Brethren {May 28th,  1570.}. It is hard to believe that all this was empty show. And yet the  truth must be confessed that this \"Union of Sendomir\" was by no means  the beautiful thing that some writers have imagined. It was the result,  to a very large extent, not of any true desire for unity, but rather of  an attempt on the part of the Polish nobles to undermine the influence  and power of the clergy. It led to no permanent union of the Protestants  in Poland. Its interest is sentimental rather than historic. For the  time--but for a very short time only--the Brethren had succeeded in  teaching others a little charity of spirit, and had thus shown their  desire to hasten the day when the Churches of Christ, no longer asunder,  shall know \"how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell  together in unity.\"    And all this--this attempt at unity, this second home for the Brethren,  this new Evangelical movement in Poland--was the strange result of the  edict issued by Ferdinand, King of Bohemia.          CHAPTER X. -- THE MARTYR-BISHOP, 1548-1560.    Meanwhile, John Augusta, the great leader of the Brethren, was passing  through the furnace of affliction.    Of all the tools employed by Ferdinand, the most crafty, active and  ambitious was a certain officer named Sebastian Schoeneich, who, in the  words of the great historian, Gindely, was one of those men fitted by  nature for the post of hangman.    For some months this man had distinguished himself by his zeal in the  cause of the King. He had seized sixteen heads of families for singing  hymns at a baker's funeral, had thrown them into the drain-vaults of the  White Tower at Prague, and had left them there to mend their ways in  the midst of filth and horrible stenches. And now he occupied the proud  position of town-captain of Leitomischl. Never yet had he known such a  golden chance of covering himself with glory. For some time Augusta, who  was now First Senior of the Church, had been hiding in the neighbouring  woods, and only two or three Brethren knew his exact abode. But already  persecution had done her work, and treachery now did hers.    Among the inhabitants of Leitomischl were certain renegade Brethren,  and these now said to the Royal Commissioners: \"If the King could only  capture and torture Augusta, he could unearth the whole conspiracy.\"    \"Where is Augusta?\" asked the Commissioners.    \"He is not at home,\" replied the traitors, \"but if you will ask his  friend, Jacob Bilek, he will tell you all you want to know.\"    The wily Schoeneich laid his plot. If only he could capture Augusta, he  would win the favour of the King and fill his own pockets with money. As  he strolled one day through the streets of Leitomischl he met a certain  innocent Brother Henry, and there and then began his deadly work.    \"If you know,\" he said, \"where Augusta is, tell him I desire an  interview with him. I will meet him wherever he likes. I have something  special to say to him, something good, not only for him, but for the  whole Brethren's Church. But breathe not a word of this to anyone else.  Not a soul--not even yourself--must know about the matter.\"    The message to Augusta was sent. He replied that he would grant the  interview on condition that Schoeneich would guarantee his personal  safety.    \"That,\" replied Schoeneich, \"is quite impossible. I cannot give any  security whatever. The whole business must be perfectly secret. Not a  soul must be present but Augusta and myself. I wouldn't have the King  know about this for a thousand groschen. Tell Augusta not to be afraid  of me. I have no instructions concerning him. He can come with an easy  mind to Leitomischl. If he will not trust me as far as that, let him  name the place himself, and I will go though it be a dozen miles away.\""]]]
