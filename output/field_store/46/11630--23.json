It would be nice if one could say that the Gobbler never again lost his  temper, but he did, a great many times, for he should have begun to  master it when he was a Chick. But one can tell truly that he never  again excused his crossness by saying that \"it was only his way.\" The  youngest Duckling in the poultry-yard had always known that this was no  excuse at all, and that if people have disagreeable habits which make  others unhappy, it is something of which they should be much ashamed.          THE BRAGGING PEACOCK      The farmyard people will never forget the coming of the Peacock; or  rather they will never forget the first day that he spent with them. He  came in the evening after all the fowls had gone to roost, and their  four-legged friends were dozing comfortably in meadow and pasture  corners, so nobody saw him until the next morning.    You can imagine how surprised they were when a beautiful great fowl of  greenish-blue strutted across the yard, holding his head well in the air  and dragging his splendid train behind him. The fowls were just starting  out for their daily walks, and they stopped and held one foot in the  air, and stared and stared and stared. They did not mean to be rude,  but they were so very much surprised that they did not think what they  were doing. Most of them thought they were asleep and dreaming, and the  dream was such a beautiful one that they did not want to move and break  it off. They had never seen a Peacock and did not even know that there  was such a fowl.    A Lamb by the pasture fence called to his mother. \"Ba-baa!\" cried he.  \"One of the cloud-birds is walking in the farmyard.\" He was thinking of  the night of the storm, when all the Sheep and Lambs huddled together in  the meadow and watched the clouds, and thought that they were birds and  dropped shining worms from their beaks.    Then the Peacock, who understood the Sheep language perfectly, said,  \"Paon! I am no cloud-bird. I am a Peacock.\" He said this in a very  haughty way, as though to be a Peacock were the grandest thing in the  world, far better than having one's home in the sky and bringing showers  to refresh the thirsty earth-people.    The Turkey Gobbler never could stand it to have others speak in that way  when he was around, so he thought he would show the newcomer how  important he was. He drew up his neck and puffed out his chest; he  pulled his skin muscles by thinking about them, and that made his  feathers stand on end; next he dropped his wings until their tips  touched the ground; then he slowly spread his tail. \"Pffff!\" said he. \"I  am no Peacock. I am a Turkey Gobbler.\"    The Hen Turkeys looked at each other with much pride. They were a little  afraid of him themselves, but they liked to have him show the newcomer  that Turkeys are important people. Their children looked at each other  and murmured, \"Isn't the Gobbler fine though? Guess the Peacock will  wish now that he hadn't put on airs.\"    But the Peacock did not seem to feel at all sorry. He stood and looked  at them all without saying a word, and they all wondered what he was  thinking. Then a Duckling who stood near him exclaimed, \"Look at his  train! Oh, look at his train!\" Everybody looked and saw all those  beautiful long feathers rising into the air. Up and up they went, and  spreading as they rose, until there was a wonderful great circle of them  back of his body and reaching far above his head. The Gobbler's spread  tail looked as small beside this as a Dove's egg would beside that of a  Goose.    \"Paon!\" said the Peacock. \"I am no Turkey Gobbler. I am a Peacock.\"    \"Pffff!\" said the Gobbler. Then he turned to the Hen Turkeys. \"My  dears,\" he said, \"I think it is time that we walked along. The children  should not be allowed to see and speak with any stray fowl that comes  along. We cannot be too particular about that.\" Then he stalked off,  with the meek Hen Turkeys following and the children lagging behind.  They did so want to stay and see the Peacock, and they thought the  Ducklings and Goslings were much luckier than they.    The Geese were delighted with the newcomer, and hoped he would be quite  friendly with them. They wished he were a swimmer, but of course they  could tell with one look that he was not. He did not have the trim,  boat-shaped body that swimmers have, and then, his feet were not webbed.  The Gander noticed that they were remarkably homely feet. He thought he  would remember this and speak of it to the Geese some time when they  were praising the Peacock's train.    The Drake was the first to speak politely to the Peacock. \"We are glad  to meet you, sir,\" he said. \"Will you be with us long?\"    \"Thank you,\" answered the Peacock. \"I have come to stay.\"    \"We hope you will like it here. I'm sorry to see you do not swim. We  should be very glad of your company if you did. You will excuse us if we  go on to the brook. We are late already.\" He and all of his family  waddled away to the water. \"A fine-looking fellow,\" said he heartily.  \"Even my cousins, the Mallard Ducks, have not such a beautiful sheen on  their neck feathers.\" The Drake was a kind, warm-hearted fellow, and it  never troubled him to know that other people were handsomer than he.    The Geese were eager to reach the water, too, but they could not leave  without asking one question. First they told the Gander to ask it, but  he replied that if they wanted to know, they should ask it for  themselves. Then they hung back and said to each other, \"You ask him. I  can't.\" At last the Gray Goose stepped forward, saying, \"Excuse us,  sir. You said that you were to stay with us, and we wish to know if you  work for your living.\"    \"I work!\" cried he. \"Paon! Never. The farmer invited me here to be  beautiful, that is all.\"    \"We are so glad,\" cackled the Geese, and the Gander joined with them.  \"So many of the people here work. They are very good, but not at all  genteel, you understand.\"    \"And don't you do anything?\" asked the Peacock. \"I thought Geese grew  feathers for beds and pillows. It seems to me you look rather ragged.  Haven't you been plucked?\"    This was very embarrassing to the Geese. \"Why, yes,\" they said, \"we do  let the farmer's wife have some feathers once in a while, when the  weather is warm, but that is very different from really working, you  know.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said the Peacock. \"If they want any of my feathers, they can  wait until I moult. Then you will see how much they think of me, for  whenever they find one of my train feathers (not tail, if you please;  every bird has a tail, but I have a train) they carry it carefully into  the house to be made into a duster for the parlor. I never give away any  but my cast-off plumage. I am so very, very beautiful that I do not have  to work.\"    This impressed the Geese very much. \"We are glad to know you. Quite  honored, we assure you!\"    The Peacock bowed his crested head, and they bowed their uncrested and  very silly ones, and then they went to the river. The Peacock thought  them most agreeable, because they admired him, and they thought him the  best sort of acquaintance, because he didn't work. It was all very  foolish, but there are always foolish people in the world, you know, and  it is much better to be amused by it and a little sorry for them, than  for us to lose our tempers and become cross about it. That was the way  the Shanghais, Black Spanish, Dorking, and Bantam fowls felt. They were  polite enough to the newcomer, but they did not run after him. The  Chickens used to laugh when the Peacock uttered his cry of \"Paon! Paon!\"  His voice was harsh and disagreeable, and it did seem so funny to hear  such dreadful sounds coming from such a lovely throat.    The Black Spanish Cock reproved the Chickens sharply for this. \"It is  very rude,\" said he, \"to laugh at people for things they cannot help.  How would you like to have a Lamb follow you around and bleat, 'Look at  that Chicken! He has only two legs! Hello, little two-legs; how can you  walk?' It is just as bad for you to laugh at his harsh voice, because he  cannot help it. If he should say foolish and silly things, you might  laugh, because he could help that if he tried. Don't ever again let me  hear you laughing when he is just saying 'Paon.'\"    The Chickens minded the Black Spanish Cock, for they knew he was right  and that he did not do rude things himself. They remembered everything  he said, too.    One day the Peacock was standing on the fence alone. He did this most of  the time. He usually stood with his back to the farmyard, so that people  who passed could see his train but not his feet. A party of young fowls  of all families came along. Their mothers had let them go off by  themselves, and they stopped to look at the Peacock.    \"I do think you have the most beautiful tail, sir,\" said a Duckling,  giving her own little pointed one a sideways shake as she spoke.    \"Please call it my train,\" said the Peacock. \"It is beautiful and I am  very proud of it. Not every fowl can grow such a train as that.\"    [Illustration: THE PEACOCK WAS STANDING ON THE FENCE.]    \"Oh, dear, no!\" giggled a jolly little Bantam Chicken. \"I'd grow one in  a minute if I could.\"    This made all the other young fowls laugh, for they thought how funny  the little brown Bantam would look dragging around a great mass of  feathers like that.    The Peacock did not even smile. He never understood a joke anyway. He  was always so busy thinking about himself that he couldn't see the  point. Now he cleared his throat and spoke to the Bantam Chicken.    \"I hope you don't think that I grew my train in a minute,\" said he. \"It  took me a long, long time, although I kept all the feathers going at  once.\"    \"Look at his crest!\" exclaimed one young Turkey in his"]]]
