I seconded his motion       and, as a young member, was more spared in the debate; but he was       denounced as an enemy of his country, and was treated with the       grossest indecorum.[104]         My opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them,       we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our       hands, to feed and clothe them well, protect them from ill usage,       require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by       freemen, and be led by no repugnances to abdicate them, and our       duties to them. The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if       that were for their good; and to commute them for other property       is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot       control.[105]    Jefferson was opposed to slavery, but he hesitated to take certain  steps against it because of public opinion.         I am very sensible of the honor you propose to me of becoming a       member of the society for the abolition of the slave trade. You       know that nobody wishes more ardently to see an abolition, not       only of the trade, but of the condition of slavery; and certainly       nobody will be more willing to encounter every sacrifice for that       object. But the influence and information of the friends to this       proposition in France will be far above the need of my       association. I am here as a public servant, and those whom I       serve, having never yet been able to give their voice against       this practice, it is decent for me to avoid too public a       demonstration of my wishes to see it abolished. Without serving       the cause here, it might render me less able to serve it beyond       the water. I trust you will be sensible of the prudence of those       motives, therefore, which govern my conduct on this       occasion.[106]         I have received a letter from Mr. Thomas Brannagan, ...       Philadelphia, asking my subscription to the work announced in the       enclosed paper.[107] The cause in which he embarks is so holy,       the sentiments he expresses in his letter so friendly, that it is       highly painful to me to hesitate on a compliance which appears so       small. But that is not its true character, and it would be       injurious even to his views, for me to commit myself on paper by       answering his letter. I have most carefully avoided every public       act of manifestation on that subject. Should an occasion ever       occur in which I can interpose with decisive effect, I shall       certainly know and do my duty with promptitude and zeal. But, in       the meantime, it would only be disarming myself of influence to       be taking small means. The subscription to a book on this subject       is one of those little irritating measures, which, without       advancing its end at all, would, by lessening the confidence and       good will of a description of friends composing a large body,       only lessen my powers of doing them good in the other great       relations in which I stand to the public. Yet, I cannot be easy       in not answering Mr. Brannagan's letter, unless he can be made       sensible that it is better I should not answer it; and I do not       know how to effect this, unless you would have the goodness ...       to enter into an explanation with him.[108]         We have received with great satisfaction notification of the       orders of his Catholic Majesty, not to permit that persons, held       in slavery within the United States, introduce themselves as free       persons into the Province of Florida.... As a consequence of the       same principles of justice and friendship, we trust that your       Excellency will permit, and aid the recovery of persons of the       same description, who have heretofore taken refuge within your       government.[109]         The governor of East Florida informs me that he has received the       King's orders, not to permit, under any pretext, that persons       held in slavery in the United States introduce themselves as       free, into the province of East Florida. I am happy that this       grievance, which had been a subject of great complaint from the       citizens of Georgia, is to be removed.[110]    Jefferson thought that the Negro republics of the West Indies would  become a safety valve for the United States.         I become daily more convinced that all the West India Islands       will remain in the hands of the people of color, and a total       expulsion of the whites sooner or later take place. It is high       time we should foresee the bloody scenes which our children       certainly, and possibly ourselves (south of the Potomac), have to       wade through and try to avert them.[111]         If something is not done, and soon done, we shall be the       murderers of our own children. The \"_murmura venturos nautis       prudentia ventos_\" has already reached us (from San Domingo); the       revolutionary storm, now sweeping the globe, will be upon us, and       happy if we make timely provision to give it an easy passage over       our land. From the present state of things in Europe and America,       the day which begins our combustion must be near at hand; and       only a single spark is wanting to make that day to-morrow. If we       had begun sooner, we might probably have been allowed a lengthier       operation to clear ourselves, but every day's delay lessens the       time we may take for emancipation. Some people derive hope from       the aid of the confederate States. But this is a delusion. There       is but one State in the Union which will aid us sincerely, if an       insurrection begins, and that one may, perhaps, have its own fire       to quench at the same time.[112]         As to the mode of emancipation, I am satisfied that that must be       a matter of compromise between the passions, the prejudices, and       the real difficulties which will each have its weight in that       operation. Perhaps the first chapter of this history, which has       begun in St. Domingo, and the next succeeding ones, will recount       how all the whites were driven from all the other islands, may       prepare our minds for a peaceable accommodation between justice,       policy and necessity; and furnish an answer to the difficult       question, whither shall the colored emigrants go? and the sooner       we put some plan under way, the greater hope there is that it may       be permitted to proceed peaceably to its ultimate effect.[113]    Jefferson finally despaired of seeing his emancipation scheme succeed.         I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision       for the extinguishment of slavery among us. There are many       virtuous men who would make any sacrifices to effect it, many       equally virtuous who persuade themselves either that the thing is       not wrong, or that it cannot be remedied, and very many with whom       interest is morality. The older we grow, the larger we are       disposed to believe the last party to be. But interest is really       going over to the side of morality. The value of the slave is       every day lessening; his burden on his master daily increasing.       Interest is, therefore, preparing the disposition to be just; and       this will be goaded from time to time by the insurrectionary       spirit of the slaves. This is easily quelled in its first       efforts; but from being local it will become general, and       whenever it does, it will rise more formidable after every       defeat, until we shall be forced, after dreadful scenes and       sufferings, to release them in their own way, which, without such       sufferings we might now model after our own convenience.[114]      VIII    Because of frequent insurrections in this country and the West Indies  there was much talk of establishing a penal colony to which the  leaders of such uprisings could be sent. With Gabriel's insurrection  in Virginia in 1800 in mind, James Monroe, then Governor of Virginia,  wrote Jefferson, asking him to support such a project, a resolution on  which had already passed the Virginia House of Delegates. Jefferson  wrote him the following:         Questions would arise whether the establishment of a (negro       penal) colony within our limits, and to become a part of our       Union, would be desirable to the State of Virginia itself, or to       other States--especially those who would be in its vicinity.       Could we procure lands beyond the limits of the United States to       form a receptacle for these people? On our northern boundary, the       country not occupied by British subjects, is the property of       Indian nations, whose title would have to be extinguished, with       the consent of Great Britain; and the new settlers would be       British subjects. It is hardly to be believed that either Great       Britain or the Indian proprietors have so disinterested a regard       for us, as to be willing to relieve us, by receiving such a       colony themselves.... On our western and southern frontiers,       Spain holds an immense country, the occupancy of which, however,       is in the Indian natives, except a few insulated spots possessed       by Spanish subjects. It is very questionable, indeed, whether the       Indians would sell? whether Spain would be willing to receive       these people? and nearly certain that she would not alienate the       sovereignty. The same question to ourselves would recur here       also, as did in the first case: should we be willing to have such       a colony in contact with us? However our present interests may       restrain us within our own limits, it is impossible not to look       forward to distant times, when our rapid multiplication will       expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern,       if not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose.

But if  again, while they are in this order, the enemy should show themselves  in the rear, each rank performs the evolution, that the strongest may  always be presented to the enemy.    But when the commander is on the left, they do not in that case  consider themselves in a worse condition, but sometimes even in a  better; for if an enemy should attempt to encompass them, he would  come round, not on the defenseless, but on the armed side. If on any  occasion, again, it should appear advantageous, for any particular  object, that the commander should occupy the right wing, they wheel  the troop toward the wing, and maneuver the main body until the  commander is on the right, and the rear becomes the left. But if,  again, the body of the enemy appear on the right, marching in column,  they do nothing else but turn each century round, like a ship, so as  to front the enemy; and thus the century which was in the rear comes  to the right. But if the enemy approach on the left, they do not allow  them to come near, but repulse them, or turn their centuries round to  face the enemy; and thus again the century that was in the rear takes  its place on the left.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 53: From the treatise on \"The Government of Lacedaemon.\"  Translated by J. S. Watson. This work is believed to be the earliest  extant specimen of Attic prose. Mahaffy describes it as \"one of the  most interesting and instructive documents of the age, very remarkable  for its Machiavellian tone, in its calm ignoring of the right and  wrong of the case as irrelevant.\"]          V    HOW TO CHOOSE AND MANAGE SADDLE-HORSES[54]      When a person would buy a horse that has been already ridden, we shall  subjoin some admonitions which he ought to bear in mind, if he would  not be cheated in his purchase. In the first place, then, let it not  escape his notice what the _age_ is; for a horse that has no longer  the marks in his teeth neither delights the buyer with hope nor is so  easy to be exchanged.    It is also necessary to see how he takes the rider on his back;[55]  for many horses reluctantly receive on them anything which it is plain  to them that they can not receive without being compelled to work. It  must likewise be observed whether, when he is mounted, he wishes to  separate himself from other horses, or whether, if he be ridden near  horses standing by, he carries off his rider toward them. There are  some horses too that, from bad training, run off from the place of  exercise to their stalls at home.    As for horses whose jaws are not alike, that sort of riding which is  called the _pede_ exposes them, and, still more, a change in the  direction in which they are ridden; for many horses will not attempt  to run away with their riders unless a hard jaw, and their course  directed homeward, concur to stimulate them. We ought to ascertain,  also, whether the horse, being put to his speed, is readily pulled up,  and whether he submits to be turned about.    It is good for a purchaser not to be too ignorant, moreover, whether a  horse is equally willing to obey when he is roused with a blow; for a  servant and an army, if disobedient, are useless, but a disobedient  horse is not only useless, but often plays the traitor.    However, when we take upon ourselves to purchase a warhorse, we must  make trial of him in all things in which war will make trial of him;  and these are leaping across ditches, springing over walls, jumping on  to mounds, and jumping down from them; and we must try him in riding  up and down steep places, and along them; for all such efforts show  his spirit, whether it is bold and whether his body is sound. Yet we  must not at once reject a horse that does not accomplish all these  feats perfectly; for many fail, not from being unable, but from want  of training; and if they are taught, and used, and exercised in such  performances, they will execute them all well, provided they are sound  in other respects, and not wanting in spirit.    We must, however, be cautious of having anything to do with horses  that are naturally shy; for horses that are excessively timorous will  not only not allow the rider on their back to harm the enemy, but will  often take him by surprize, and expose him to great danger. We must  also learn whether the horse has anything of vice either toward other  horses or toward men, and whether he is averse to being handled; for  all such defects are troublesome to his owner.    As to any reluctance to being bridled and mounted, and other tricks, a  person will much sooner discover them if, when the horse has been  thoroughly exercised, he attempt to do to him what he did before he  began to ride him; since horses that, after having been exercised, are  ready to submit to exercise again give sufficient proofs of a  mettlesome spirit.    To sum up all in a few words, whatever horse has good feet, is  mild-tempered, sufficiently swift, is willing and able to endure  fatigue, and is in the highest degree obedient will probably give  least trouble to his rider, and contribute most to his safety in  military occupations. But horses that from sluggishness require a  great deal of driving or, from excess of mettle, much coaxing and  care, afford plenty of employment to the rider, as well as much  apprehension in time of danger....    We shall now show how a man may groom a horse with least danger to  himself and most benefit to the animal. If, when he cleans him, he  look the same way as the horse, there is danger that he may be struck  in the face with his knee or his hoof. But if he look in the opposite  direction to the horse when he cleans him, keeping himself out of the  reach of his leg, and rubs gradually down by the shoulder, he will  thus receive no injury, and may clean the frog of the horse's foot by  turning up the hoof. In like manner let him clean the hind legs.    But whoever is employed about a horse ought to know that to do these  things, and everything else that he has to do, he must come as little  as possible near the face and the tail; for if a horse be inclined to  be vicious, he has in both these parts the advantage of the man. But a  person who approaches him at the side may manage the horse with least  danger to himself, and with most power over the beast.    When we have to lead a horse, we do not approve of the practise of  leading from behind, for these reasons: that the person leading the  horse is thus least able to keep on his guard against him, and the  horse has most liberty to do what he pleases. To the mode, again, of  conducting him with a long rein, to teach him to go forward and take  the lead, we object for the following reasons: that the horse can do  mischief on whichever side he pleases, and that, by turning himself  round, he can set himself opposite his leader. When there are a number  of horses together, too, how, if they are thus led, can they be  prevented from annoying one another? But a horse that is accustomed to  be led at the side will be least in a condition to molest either other  horses or men, and will be readiest at hand for his rider whenever he  may require to mount in haste.    That the groom may put on the bridle properly, let him first approach  the horse on the left side, and then throwing the reins over the  horse's head, let him suffer them to rest on the point of the  shoulder; and next let him take the headpiece in his right hand, and  apply the bit with his left. If the horse take the bit into his mouth,  the man has nothing to do but to put on the headpiece; but if the  horse will not open his mouth, the man must hold the bit to his teeth,  and insert the middle finger of his left hand between the horse's  bars; for most horses, when this is done, open their mouths; should  the horse, however, not even then receive the bit, let him press the  lip against the dog-tooth or tusk, and there are very few horses that,  on feeling this, will not admit it....    But never to approach a horse in a fit of anger is the one great  precept and maxim of conduct in regard to the treatment of a horse;  for anger is destitute of forethought, and consequently often does  that of which the agent must necessarily repent.    When a horse is shy of any object, and reluctant to approach it, the  rider must try to make him feel that there is nothing terrible in it,  especially to a horse of spirit; but if he can not succeed, the rider  must himself touch that which appears so alarming, and lead the horse  up gently to it. As to those who force horses forward with blows in  such a case they merely inspire the animals with greater terror; for  they imagine when they suffer any pain at such a time, that what they  look upon with alarm is in some way the cause of it.    When the groom brings the horse to the rider, we have no objection  that he should know how to make the horse stoop, so that it may be  easy to mount him; yet we think every rider ought to take care to be  able to mount even if the horse does not bend to him; for sometimes a  different horse will present himself, and the same horse will not  always be equally obedient....    When he has taken his seat, whether on the horse's bare back or on the  cloth, we do not like that he should sit as if he were on a  carriage-seat, but as if he were standing upright with his legs  somewhat apart, for thus he will cling more firmly to the horse with  his thighs, and keeping himself erect, he will be able to throw a  javelin, or to strike a blow on horseback, if it be necessary, with  greater force.    But it is necessary to allow the leg, as well as the foot, to hang  loose from the knee; for if a rider keep his leg stiff, and strike it  against anything, it may be broken; but if the leg hang easy, and  anything strikes against it, it will yield, and yet not move the thigh  from its position.    A rider should also accustom himself to keep the parts of his body"]]]
