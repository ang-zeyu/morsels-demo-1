Half  belle, half _religieuse_ we may style her.    \"And on what have these dainty minds been nurtured, and who have been  their intellectual mentors?  Lela has been bred within a cloister's  walls, and foreign travel has polished both mind and manners.    \"In no school has Majoli's mind been formed, nor is she greatly  indebted to learned professors for her mental attainments.  A mother's  love has quickened the budding intellect, a mother's intelligence has  trained and directed the unfolding powers.  The grace of foreign speech  is on her tongue, and scenes and pictures of distant lands are  enshrined in her memory.  Ancient lore has for her a peculiar charm;  history is her delight; Plutarch, Josephus, Gibbon, Macaulay, she has  conned well.  Poesy she loves much.  The poetry of the Bible, Dante,  Schiller, Herbert, Browning, are her favorites.  In sacred books she  finds sweet enjoyment.  The Fathers of the Church afford her great  pleasure; St. Augustine, St. Basil, Thomas a Kempis, etc.  She has the  grace of devotion, but her love of the Church is affected more by its  aesthetical qualities than its theological dogmas.    \"Lela is a passionate book-lover.  There are few modern writers that  have not furnished entertainment to her accomplished mind, and she is  not unacquainted with the best Latin and Greek authors.  English,  German, and French literature are alike open to her.  Biography,  essays, dramas, poetry, with more serious reading, occupy her time.  Virgil and Horace, Bacon, Shakespeare, Racine, Victor Hugo, Heine and  George Eliot may be mentioned as among her preferences.    \"But while we are attempting to portray some noticeable characteristics  in Lela and Majoli, how are Celina and Guerrabella occupied?  You see  Guerrabella has a pencil in her hand.  She is sketching a head; if we  look closely, we shall probably recognize our own, grotesquely drawn,  for there is no denying that our young genius is fond of caricaturing  her friends.  Celina sits by a table; her large, open eyes have a  distant, dreamy expression.  Her pen moves rapidly across the page; she  is writing a Musical Recollection, we may presume.    \"Guerrabella is the youngest of the group.  She is tall, picturesque,  imposing.  Her face is radiant with blushes, dimples, and smiles.  She  looks so fresh and beautiful that she might have set for Greuze's  picture of 'Sweet Sixteen.'  A sense of thorough enjoyment flashes from  the bright, blue-gray eyes, and is indicated by the rose-bloom on cheek  and lips.  There is an air of strength and courage perceptible, and a  certain dash in her manner that associates her with Scott's favorite  heroine, Di Vernon.  She has great mimic powers, and might adorn the  histrionic stage.  Towards art and literature she seems equally  attracted, and what she will eventually decide to follow we cannot now  predict.  She will fail in nothing for want of talent.    \"Celina's height scarce reaches to Guerrabella's shoulder; her figure  is fragile and dainty; and though her cheek lacks bloom, the lines are  soft and graceful, and the face pensive and poetic.  The mouth is small  and well curved, and the air of repose that rests upon the imaginative  brow resembles the Muse of Meditation.  The serenity that is uniformly  spread over her unique countenance is in strong contrast to the  animated, vivacious features of her cousin.  Celina's head is fashioned  after a classic model, and the mass of amber-hued hair which crowns it  might be taken for an aureola.  Her pansy-like eyes are full of sweet,  poetic vision.  The brow is marked by delicately defined eyebrows, and  the eyelashes are long and silken.  'Tis a melodic countenance,  foreshadowing that dream-world from which our young heroine has never  for a moment awakened.  Too _petite_, some might deem her, for womanly  perfection; but physical symmetry, ease, and a dignified bearing  elevate the fairy figure to the true standard.  She moves about with an  airy grace, and nothing earthly is lighter than her footfall.  Her  small, delicate hands grace the keyboard, and music in her has an  enchanting interpreter.    \"Guerrabella participates in the family passion for literature.  She  possesses great intellectual independence, and her preferences are  decided, usually inclining to the bold and strong.  She is fond of  Macaulay's 'Heroic Lays of Many Lands;' she rejoices in Becky Sharp;  and there is a tradition that she learned to read in the works of  Thackeray, spelling out the words of that magnificent novel, Henry  Esmond.    \"Celina has explored the treasures of classic lore in music and  literature.  Homer, Herodotus, Plato, she has read, with Tasso and his  chivalrous lays, and Spenser and his stately verse.  In music, Glueck  and Gretry, Beethoven and Boieldieu's dulcet tones have helped to  fashion her musical mind.    \"But we must not dismiss our heroines without indicating the toilettes  that most become them.  Velvets and rich brocade befit the Lady Lela's  superb figure.  Scarlet is her color, and diamonds her essential  ornament.  The moss-rose should be her favorite flower.    \"Soft gray or pale azure of light fabrics do best agree with Majoli's  sylph-like form.  Pearls and feathers are consonant to her artistic  taste.  Her emblematic flower is the lily, of sacred and legendary lore.    \"All shades and fabrics of whatever texture harmonize with  Guerrabella's style.  Ample should be the folds that habit her majestic  figure, and brilliant the gems that are to rival her flashing,  sparkling eyes: yet we might indicate _couleur de rose_ as best  blending with her own exquisite tints, and the opal with its mysterious  light as in some way prefiguring her genius and high destiny.    \"And how shall we vest our _mignonne_--Celina?  Gossamer tissues,  fabrics of airy texture--a magic web for the daintiest Lady in our  Land.  No color of human invention; their dyes would oppress her.  _White_ with a gleam of moonlight upon it; a reflection of the aura of  her hair, or the first pale beams of the morning.  Other gems would I  not but those wondrous starlike eyes, to light up a face radiant with  thought and sensibility.\"      [1] For Lilian, Ida's second name.          CHAPTER XIII.

'Tow-head,' 'gawky,' 'plain,' and 'clownish,' are some of the most  uncomplimentary epithets applied to him.  He is described as having  'white hair with a tinge of orange at the ends,' and as 'eating as if  for a wager;' while grandpapa, the writer says, was so poor that papa  had to walk barefooted over the thistles, without a jacket, and in  trousers cut with an utter disregard of elegance or fit, and it was  remarked that they were _always_ short in the legs, while one was  invariably shorter than the other.  Was it possible that grandpapa  could not afford an inch more of cloth to make poor papa's trousers of  equal length, and was it true that papa never had but two shirts at a  time until he came to New York, and that he never had any gloves?  When  he was an apprentice in Portland every one used to pity him, Mr. ------  says, as he walked shivering to the _Spectator_ office on cold winter  days, thinly clad, and with his gloveless hands thrust into his pockets  to protect them from being frost-bitten!\"    \"My child, you overwhelm me with your questions,\" said mamma.  \"Let me  take them singly, and I will do my best to refute this writer's  unpleasant statements.    \"First as to personal appearance.  You say he styles your papa 'plain'  as a boy.  That is absurd, for his features, like mother's, were as  perfect as a piece of Grecian sculpture.  'Tow-head' is also a  mis-statement.  Brother's hair never was at any time tow-color, and the  tinge of orange at the ends existed only in the author's imagination.  Tow-color, you know, is a sort of dirty white or gray; whereas  brother's hair, until he was thirty years old, was like Raffie's, pure  white.  After that time, it commenced to change to a pale gold-color,  which never, however, deepened into orange.  What was your next  question, my dear?\"    \"About papa's wardrobe,\" said Gabrielle, her cheeks still flushed with  excitement; \"were you indeed so miserably poor, auntie?\"    \"We were certainly very poor after father failed,\" said mamma firmly,  \"but we were by no means reduced to abjectness.  I can never remember  the time, in our poorest days, when the boys had not, besides their  brown linen work-day shirts, cotton shirts for Sunday, and father his  'fine shirt' to wear to church and for visiting.  Your papa was dressed  suitably for our station in life--neither better nor worse than the  sons of neighbors in our circumstances.  As for going barefoot, all  country boys at that time did so during the summer months; your papa  was not an exception.    \"You speak of his gloveless hands.  I never saw a pair of kid gloves  worn by farmers while we lived in Vermont or Pennsylvania; and  certainly they would have been very inappropriate for a boy-farmer or a  printer's apprentice to wear; but brother was always, both at home and  at Poultney, supplied with warm woollen mittens of mother's knitting.  As for the cut of his trousers, I am surprised that any sensible author  should use so unfit a word as 'elegance' in speaking "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#18)"],[1,"the rain, and so lost for ever? Perhaps  the absence of lime in this field accounts for its beneficial  action in the experiment just detailed; but if my supposition is  correct, that any excess of potash which may be liberated from the  clay by the use of quicklime (that is, any more than may be  required to perfect the crop), is washed down the drains, and thus  the land is permanently impoverished by the excessive use of lime,  it behoves landed proprietors to ascertain what is required, and  they should take care to apply no more than is necessary. This  caution is most particularly needed in this neighbourhood, where  lime is cheap, and where the opinion is prevalent that the more  there is applied the better it is for the land, and where it is  common to apply ten or twelve tons to the acre. I have stated  above that chemical manure was applied to a small portion of the  field after the setting-in of the drought in April. The action of  this manure showed that a good thing may be very injurious if  applied at an improper time; for, although it produced a  stimulating effect on the plant immediately after its application,  there was too little moisture in the land to dissolve it  thoroughly, and thus enable the plants to appropriate it, until  the rain came, about the end of June, when the wheat had been in  flower some time; but the stimulus was then so great that all the  plants threw up fresh stalks (from the roots), which were in  flower when the wheat was cut, and it was then found that they had  not only impoverished the plants, but had prevented the grain from  ripening. This was the case not only in the experimental field,  but in several others also, where the chemical manure was sowed  after the setting-in of the drought. When the field was sowed with  guano, it was thought desirable to cover one part of it with the  African, and the other with Peruvian, for the sake of comparison;  but as the African did not appear to produce the same stimulating  effect as the other, fifty per cent. more was applied, that the  cost might be equal (the Peruvian cost 10s., the African 7s. per  cwt.); but as the latter application of the African was made when  the wheat was just shooting into ear, the same objection applies  to the experiment which does to the chemical manure applied after  the drought had set in--viz., that there was not sufficient  moisture in the soil to dissolve it thoroughly until the plant was  too far advanced to benefit by it; and therefore its failure would  be no proof of the value of the African as compared with the  Peruvian, which was the object of the experiment. It is true, no  bad effects followed the application similar to those produced by  the misapplication of the chemical manure in dry weather, yet if  soluble salts like the latter did not find sufficient moisture in  the ground when applied in April, there is reason to suppose that  the former would not do so when applied in May. I regret the  failure of the experiment without any manure, as I think the  result would have shown satisfactorily that the land is so far  from being impoverished by this system of cropping, that it is  improving every year. I think, however, that this is shown by the  produce of the land manured with guano alone. In the first year's  experiment the produce from guano alone was 27 bushels per acre,  and both straw and wheat were very indifferent in quality. This  year the produce from guano alone is 42 1/3 bushels; and although  neither straw nor wheat are so good as upon the adjoining lands,  they are both very much better than they were in 1842. It will be  observed that the result from the unsubsoiled portion is very  good, and if nothing more were said about it, people would be led  to conclude that there was no advantage in subsoiling. But this,  in my opinion, would be a great mistake; for to say nothing of the  advantage which the unsubsoiled portion would derive from the  drainage which it received from the subsoiling on each side of it,  I found, when the field was ploughed up this autumn, that whilst  the unsubsoiled portion was stiff and heavy, the subsoiled part  was comparatively friable and loose, like a garden, and will, I  expect, show its superiority in the succeeding crops. It must be  borne in mind, in reading these experiments, that we have here one  of the most unfavourable climates in the kingdom for growing  wheat, from the excessive quantity of rain that falls, three times  more rain falling annually in the north of Lancashire than at  York, and this, no doubt, is very prejudicial to the success of  such a series of experiments as I have been detailing. It has been  objected to these experiments, that allowing all to have been done  which is here detailed, it leads to no important conclusion; for  although it may be practicable to grow wheat every year, in a  small field like the one experimented on, it is not so on a large  scale. But the objectors should remember that there is not the  seed of a single weed sowed with the manure; and therefore if the  land is thoroughly cleaned, and kept so, by hoeing the crop in the  spring, it will require very little labour to fit it for another.  But I shall be better able to speak on this head next harvest,  having sowed wheat on an oat stubble with once ploughing. It is  said there are no weeds in Chinese husbandry, and if they can  eradicate them completely, so may we, if we adopt the same methods  and follow them up as perseveringly. Again, admitting that it is  not practicable to grow wheat on the same land year after year on  a large scale, yet if we can double the crop in those years in  which we do grow it, by the application of chemical manures (and  the same manures are applicable to all cereal crops), will not  that be a conclusion worth arriving at? That it is possible to do  so, is, I think, sufficiently shown by the results I have  obtained. What, then, may we expect when these experiments are  infinitely multiplied and varied, under the superintendence of  skilful and experienced men, who will devote their whole time and  attention to the subject? Will raising the average produce from  twenty-five to fifty bushels per acre be the utmost limit to which  improvement can be carried? I believe not. In conclusion, I would  urge on all owners and occupiers of land, the importance of  devoting at least a small field to agricultural experiments, as I  think there can be no doubt that, if these are carefully and  systematically made and followed up by agriculturists generally,  we shall be so far from needing an importation of corn in average  years that we shall have a large surplus to spare for our  neighbours.    NOTE.--In the use of silicates of soda and potash one precaution  is very necessary--viz., that you really have a soluble silicate,  and not a mere mechanical mixture of ground flint and soda: this  is a very different thing, and one, if it be not carefully guarded  against, which will lead to nothing but disappointment. Again, the  silicate may be properly made in the first place, but in a long  exposure to the atmosphere the soda attracts carbonic acid, and  the soda is liberated, and this has defeated my expectations more  than once. Again, though I consider it desirable to defer the  application of it until vegetation has fairly started in the  spring, yet, in one instance, I delayed the application of it so  long, that there was not moisture to dissolve it until the end of  June, and then the wheat began to shoot afresh from the roots and  the crop was seriously injured by it: but this was in an  exceedingly dry spring, and might not happen again for many years.    * * * * *    _To the same._    LOW MOOR, _18th December_, 1845.    SIR,--I promised to communicate to you the results of my attempt  to grow wheat on the same land year after year, this being the  fourth crop of wheat (the fifth white crop) grown in successive  years on the same soil, and though I consider the crop an  indifferent one, I don't think the failure ought in any degree to  be attributed to the over-cropping, but to the wetness and  coldness of the season, as well as other untoward circumstances  hereafter to be mentioned.    In a former letter of mine of the 12th October, 1844--which was  published in the \"Guardian\" a few days after--I gave an account of  the crop of 1844, which was a very good one, being fifty bushels  to the acre throughout the field, and as much as fifty-two bushels  in the best part of it. This I considered so satisfactory that I  had the field again ploughed up and sowed with wheat on the 9th  October, 1844, and it is to the results of this crop that I wish  to call your attention. As remarked in my former letter, the field  was subsoil ploughed in the autumn of 1843, and this subsoiling  was carried to such a depth that most of the drains in the field  were more or less injured by it; and although this did no injury  to the crop of 1844, owing to the very dry season, yet when the  rain came in the winter of 1844, the want of drainage was found to  be very prejudicial, and in the wet places large patches of the  young wheat went off altogether, and there was a great deficiency  of roots in many parts of the field; the long continuance of frost  and after that the ungenial weather which continued so long in the  spring (of 1845) were also unfavourable, yet with all these  drawbacks the appearance of the plant after the growing weather  _did_ come, was very promising, and many of my friends predicted  that I should have as good a crop as in 1844. On the 24th March I  applied chemical manure of the same kind as I had done in 1844, at  the rate of about 3 1/4 cwt. to the acre (costing 23s. 6d.), and a  fortnight after I had it sowed with 2 cwt. of guano to the acre.  When the warm weather came, these manurings seemed to help it  wonderfully, and it was, as I have before stated, a very promising  crop; but the cold,"]]]
