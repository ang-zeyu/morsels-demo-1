Their bays are planned on wholly different proportions to those of the  nave and choir. There every bay is divided into two main divisions, and  the main arch is nearly half of the whole. Here the divisions are  three--a main arch, a very large triforium, and a smaller clerestory.  The ornamental details are very rich and bold, but the design, taken as  a whole, is not altogether excellent. Professor Freeman says bluntly  that \"the feeble clerestory and broad and sprawling triforium are  unsatisfactory.\" This is true enough, but the whole effect is far better  than might be expected. The great width of the transepts in proportion  to their length, and the great size of the lantern, coupled with the  fact that they are not vaulted, makes one apt to forget that they are  divided into bays at all, and to regard the whole as a gigantic hall  divided into three storeys and magnificently decorated.    The plan of the bays, like that of the decorated part of the choir at  Ely and the nave of Lichfield, is probably a reminiscence of Norman  proportions. It is certainly better suited to the bold outlines and  masses of the Norman period.    Here, as in the nave, the main piers are rather thin. The triforium  appears to be \"sprawling,\" because it consists of a single great arch in  each bay, sub-divided into four smaller ones. The clerestory is small  rather than feeble. Its five lancets, though not large, are boldly  decorated with shafts, carvings, and mouldings.    The chief drawback to the design lies in the exceeding prominence of the  triforium, owing to which the eye is drawn to the middle storey, rather  than led up from the floor to the roof. And as this middle storey  consists of a single bold arch in each bay, it has not the merit of  horizontal continuity, found, for example, in the triforium at Beverley,  and does not lead the eye, once directed to it, from bay to bay.    Like the nave, therefore, though for very different reasons, the  transept should be examined bay by bay if the beauties of plan and of  detail are to be appreciated, and these beauties, at least those of  detail, are abundant.    There are some differences of detail between the east and west sides of  the south transept, and also between the south and north transepts. The  east and west sides of the north transept are practically identical,  except for the fact that a Decorated pillar without Purbeck marble  shafts has replaced an original Early English pillar on the west side of  the north transept. This was probably made necessary by the height of  the tower.    The differences between the east and west sides of the south transept  are as follow:--    The windows in the southern bay of the west aisle are blank. They are  pierced on the eastern aisle.    The vaulting ribs of the western aisle are plain. They are elaborately  moulded in the eastern aisle.    The arcade in the eastern aisle is shorter than in the western, and does  not reach to the ground.    There is a niche against the north-west pier of the tower, but none on  the north-east.    There is a leaf moulding above the clerestory on the eastern side. The  same moulding on the west is plain.    The eastern moulding of the main arches on the eastern side is  dog-tooth. It is plain on the west. The other mouldings of the main  arches are also differently arranged.    The spandrels of the triforium are decorated with circles of carved  foliage, five to each bay, on the west side. These are absent on the  east.    The north transept differs from the south in the following respects:--    The arches of the arcade at the north end of the north transept are  trefoiled. They are plain at the south end of the south.    The main piers of the north transept have a ridge running down their  alternate stone shafts. This ridge is wanting in the south.    Their capitals are richer, and, curiously enough, apparently later in  detail.    In the clerestory of the north transept there are large dog-tooth  mouldings between the Purbeck marble shafts wanting in the south  transept. There is also more dog-tooth in the arch mouldings of the  clerestory of the north transept than of the south.    In the north transept the moulding between the clerestory and triforium  is dog-tooth. It is plain in the south transept.    The arcades of the aisles are practically the same in both aisles,  except for the differences noted between the east and west aisle of the  south transepts.    There are two rows of dog-tooth moulding round the windows in the aisles  of the north transept, but only one in the south.    The clerestory shafts in the aisle of the north transept are bolder than  in the south, and the capitals, especially on the east side, are more  elaborate and beautiful.    The extra Decorated pillar on the west side of the north transept has  already been noted.    The ends of the transepts are, of course, entirely different in  arrangement. Purbeck marble is used lavishly all over the transepts; as,  for example, alternately with stone in the main piers, on the shafts of  the aisles, and in the triforium and clerestory. The main vaulting  shafts are altogether of Purbeck.    The arcade at both ends of the transepts is entirely without Purbeck  marble.    In the south front the shafts of the lowest row of windows are  alternately of Purbeck and stone. The arcading above the door is wholly  Purbeck, with dog-tooth mouldings of stone. The shafts of the central  windows are Purbeck with alternate dog-tooth mouldings, and there are  Purbeck shafts at the side of the rose window.    There are also Purbeck shafts on each side of the door, beginning above  the arcade below.    In the north front, the shafts of the five sisters and of the five  lancets above them are alternately marble and stone.    As has been said, the proportions of the bays in the transepts are very  different to those of the nave. The triforium is much larger, and the  clerestory much smaller. The main arches, slightly smaller in proportion  than those of the nave, are extraordinarily rich and beautiful in  detail. Their mouldings are very complex and deep, and are varied with  dog-tooth and billet ornament.    The piers are perhaps too thin, though beautiful enough in themselves.  They are made up of alternate shafts of Purbeck marble and stone. Those  of Purbeck are ringed half-way up. The Decorated piers are altogether of  stone, and not ringed at all. The arrangement of the shafts is not quite  so bold and various as in some other Early English work--the choirs of  Ely and Worcester, for example.    The capitals are finely carved, though small. Those in the north  transept are rather richer than those in the south.    [Illustration: South Transept, Triforium, and Clerestory.]    The corbels of the vaulting shafts, which are placed just above the  capitals of the piers, are very large and richly decorated with four  rows of foliage.    They support three shafts each, one large and two very slender, as in  the nave. On each side of the larger shaft is a dog-tooth moulding.    The main arches, especially on the east side of the south transept, are  considerably out of plumb, owing to the great weight of the lantern, and  perhaps to the inferior material used in the transepts.    The triforium consists of a single great circular arch in each bay. It  is divided by a thick central cluster of shafts into two smaller arches,  and these in turn are divided by slenderer piers into two smaller arches  still. In the head of the largest arch is a cinquefoil opening  ornamented with cusps and dog-tooth moulding.    In the heads of the smaller arches are quatrefoil openings decorated in  the same way. The mouldings of the large arches are very bold, and  ornamented with dog-tooth; those of the lesser arches are less bold and  plainer.    The shafts of the triforium run down on to a gabled sill which cuts into  their bases. There is the same arrangement in the choir.    The clerestory consists of an arcade of five divisions, the three middle  being windows, the outer ones blind. The clusters of shafts dividing  them are very rich and thick.    The mouldings of the arches are broad and deep, the dog-tooth ornament  being profusely used. Above the arches is a cornice decorated with  foliage.    The vaulting shafts terminate in the wooden ribs of the roof, without  the division of a capital, about two feet above the string course.    The aisles are vaulted, as in the rest of the minster, with stone.    The shafts supporting the vault are very richly clustered and varied.  The mouldings also are broad and deep; in fact, some of the finest work  in the whole of the minster is to be found in these aisles. Below the  aisle windows runs an arcade with trefoiled arches, which is very plain  and simple in its details.    The ends of the transepts, as has been said, are altogether different.  The arrangement of the windows of the south front is described in the  account of the interior. That arrangement is not particularly happy on  the outside. It is even less so when seen from within. This is partly  the result of the stained glass of different periods now in the windows,  and partly of the scattered and confused spacing of the windows  themselves. Inside, as well as outside, the great rose window appears  much too large for its position, and the vaulting, raised to allow the  whole of it to be seen, fits awkwardly round it.    The north end of the transept, however, is one of the most triumphant  successes in the whole minster. Its plan is magnificently simple. It is  almost entirely filled by two rows of lancet windows, the five sisters,  and five much smaller windows of graduated sizes above them.    The five sisters are, no doubt, the largest lancet windows in England,  and it was a bold idea to fill almost the whole of that great front with  them, but the boldness was entirely justified by the result.    It might perhaps have been expected"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],[0,"The Story of Porcelain (#18)"],[1,"china?\" asked Theo.    \"It is said that between 1730 and 1744 they did make some; and this  product is supposed to be the only true porcelain ever made in  England. It was manufactured at Stratford-le-Bow, and where do you  think the clay for it came from? Strangely enough from our own State  of Virginia. You can imagine the expense of bringing the clay across  the Atlantic. This ware known for convenience as Bow became very  popular. The first of it was hand-painted, but later the designs were  transferred, and the product became cheaper. Not only were tea sets  made, but also a great number of china figures of birds, animals, and  shepherdesses; there were even some statuettes of celebrities of the  time, which remain as an interesting record of the costumes of the  period. Owing to the fact that much of the Bow china was unmarked it  is frequently confused with the soft ware made at Chelsea, which was  also of early English manufacture.\"    \"Did the Bow factories continue?\" asked Theo.    \"About 1775 the Bow works were merged with those of Derby; and in  1784, the Chelsea fabrique was also absorbed by the Derby  company. Derby china, especially Crown Derby, you must remember, is  one of the finest of present day English wares. About 1777 these  factories came under the patronage of King George III, at which time  the term Crown Derby was bestowed on the product.\"    \"Then an English king did help in English porcelain-making after all!\"  exclaimed Theo.    \"To a certain extent, yes,\" answered Mr. Croyden. \"The English  nobility, too, patronized the royal factories. The ware was so  beautiful perhaps people were only too glad to do so. There were  plates with deep borders of solid rich color, frequently adorned with  heavy gold work; and there were vases, pitchers, and bowls of  magnificent hue. In fact, the use of blue and gold was brought to a  greater perfection in this ware than ever before, and it established  for the makers a wide-reaching reputation. Possibly this reputation  might have remained preeminent had not the short-sighted manufacturers  begun to sell at a lower rate their imperfect pieces, or seconds.  Great quantities of these flooded the market and immediately the fame  of the ware decreased.\"    \"What a pity!\"    \"Since then this erroneous policy has been corrected in so far as has  been possible; but the blot on the history of the Derby porcelain  remains, proving that a firm that values its standing should never  allow imperfect products to go beyond its doors. William Cookworthy,  who, by the way, made the Bow china and who lived at Plymouth,  England, in 1760, finally discovered deposits of true kaolin at  Cornwall, and of this material made some more true porcelain; but  unfortunately much of it was injured in the firing. His workmen did  not understand the difficulties and dangers of exposing the ware to  the extreme heat. But this Plymouth ware held an interesting place in  the development of English china-making.\"    \"Did the Plymouth works grow and become larger?\" asked Theo.    \"Alas, much beautiful porcelain, copied to a great extent from Chinese  and Continental wares, was made there, but the expense of turning it  out was so great that poor Cookworthy sunk a fortune in the  enterprise. However, the venture was not without its fruits, for out  of the Plymouth fabrique developed that of Bristol, and later that of  Shelton, or New Hall. All of these plants manufactured hard paste  chinas. At Bristol in 1774 a wonderfully fine tea and coffee set was  made for Edmund Burke, the renowned English orator. In the meantime  all over England small fabriques were springing up. At Pinxton,  Swansea, Coalport, Liverpool and Rockingham; most of these factories  made soft paste chinas. Then came an innovation. One of the most  perfect of English porcelains, known as Spode, was produced by  combining with this type of paste pulverized bones.\"    \"Bones!\"    \"Yes. It seems a strange idea, doesn't it? But it was a great  discovery, and one that has been generally adopted and used ever since  by the principal china-making firms of England. The bone element, or  phosphate of lime, as it is more properly termed, imparts both  strength and elasticity to the china. Minton ware, first made in 1791  and now extensively manufactured in England and sold throughout the  china-buying world, is one of these bone chinas. It is a great  favorite because of its durability as well as its beauty. There were  in addition many other very fine chinas made in England--far too many  of them for me to enumerate. One was the Lowestoft, made from about  1756 in soft paste, and in 1775 in hard. Much of it is in imitation of  the Chinese, although some was decorated with roses, and some with  landscapes or coats of arms. As it had no mark upon it it is now  difficult to be sure of the genuine ware. Moreover, a large amount of  the white porcelain, it is said, was sent from China to Lowestoft to  be decorated, and therefore the body of it is of Oriental and not  English make. Worcester is another of the celebrated soft paste  chinas, which at first copied Oriental designs, and later branched off  into imitations of Dresden or Sevres wares. It is still made and  widely sold.\"    \"It seems as if a great many of the English wares were copies of  somebody else's work,\" remarked Theo.    \"I am afraid they were,\" owned Mr. Croyden. \"England was not rich in  originality of design. The work of Wedgwood is the only distinctively  inventive contribution made to the china-making art. However, the  English bone porcelains are very beautiful, and though they are not  genuine feldspathic products they are highly esteemed and in demand  everywhere. Now you must own, Theo, that I have given you a pretty  complete outline of the pottery and porcelain-making of the European  countries. Holland and Belgium, as I have told you, lack both clay and  fuel and therefore had not a fair chance to compete with the other  nations; but they did make some little porcelain. Sweden also turned  out a little. Denmark gave a real contribution to the world in its  Copenhagen ware, a type of white porcelain decorated beneath the glaze  in cobalt. The fabrique for making this china was opened as early as  1760 but it never paid, and in 1775 the Government took over the works  and it became a royal factory where women of rank and position joined  the artists in designing and decorating the porcelain. The  undertaking, however, proved so expensive that in 1876 the factories  went back into private hands. But the porcelain has become  world-famous and holds its place in the list of the distinctive chinas  of the art universe. Look up Royal Copenhagen some time, and see how  beautiful it is.\"    \"I will,\" nodded Theo. \"But in all this china-making did Russia do  nothing?\"    \"Russia made her try,\" Mr. Croyden said. \"Peter the Great was an  ambitious ruler who traveled the Continent over to see what other  countries were doing in the way of commerce and manufacture. When he  returned from one of his pilgrimages he made the people build a new  commercial and industrial centre--St. Petersburg, now Petrograd. Here  he set his subjects to making all sorts of artistic things such as he  had seen in Europe, especially brass, copper, and silver  articles. From 1744 to 1765 under the Empresses Elizabeth and  Catherine II a little really fine hard paste was produced. It was a  porcelain in imitation of Dresden; but there never was very much of it  manufactured. A little Russian porcelain was also made at Moscow and  Poland. The Russians never excelled in pottery and porcelain-making,  however, as they did in metal work.\"    Mr. Croyden rose.    \"See,\" he said, \"here comes your father! That means that we must bid  good-bye to china-making for to-day. I fear we shall have to say  good-bye to it altogether, too, for by to-morrow morning we shall be  getting into New York and separating for home. But you are not to  forget, Theo, that I want you to come to Trenton the first minute you  are rid of these crutches. Then I shall tramp you through my factories  and you shall see how all this porcelain we have talked of is made.\"    \"I shall be mighty glad to come,\" responded Theo.    \"I must leave it to your father's discretion, then, to notify me when  he thinks you are able to make the visit,\" added the merchant, turning  to Dr. Swift who had just joined them. \"You just telephone me, Doctor,  when you think you can spare this boy of yours; will you?\"    \"You are very kind, Croyden.\"    \"Not a bit! Not a bit!\" protested Mr. Croyden. \"I shall want to see  Theo, and I am anxious to have Mrs. Croyden meet him too. I only wish  we had a boy just like him; then I'd have somebody to leave my  business to.\"    He drummed on the window moodily.    \"Who knows but I may be coming to help you make china one of these  days, sir,\" suggested Theo half jokingly.    The man wheeled sharply.    \"I wish I thought you would,\" was his quick response. \"If at the end  of your college career you find yourself with any such notion, sonny,  you'll be very welcome.\"    With an affectionate glance at the boy Mr. Croyden strode off into  the smoking-car.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER XII    THEO MAKES A PRESENT      There was great rejoicing when Theo and his father reached home. It  seemed as if Mrs. Swift could never do enough for her boy. The whole  house was turned upside down to make him comfortable, and on the  dinner table were all his favorite dishes.    \"To see your mother, Theo, anybody would think you were a fragile  invalid just out of the hospital rather than a husky young camper  returned from the woods,\" growled the Doctor. \"My dear,\" he  continued, addressing his wife, \"Theo hasn't had as much attention as  this in all the time he has been ill. Croyden and I have not pranced  round after him, I assure you. He has had to brace up and bear his  troubles like a soldier; and he "]]]
