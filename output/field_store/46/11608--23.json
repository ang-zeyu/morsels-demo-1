We will then give you  ten minutes' grace, after which we shall take whatever steps we  choose.\"    \"Agreed!\" cried Fu-Manchu. \"I ask but one thing from an Englishman;  your word of honour?\"    \"I give it.\"    \"I, also,\" said Smith hoarsely.           *       *       *       *       *    Ten minutes later, Nayland Smith and I, standing beside the cab, whose  lights gleamed yellowly through the mist, exchanged a struggling,  frightened bird for our lives--capitulated with the enemy of the white  race.    With characteristic audacity--and characteristic trust in the British  sense of honour--Dr. Fu-Manchu came in person with Nayland Smith, in  response to the wailing signal of the dacoit who had accompanied me.  No word was spoken, save that the cabman suppressed a curse of  amazement; and the Chinaman, his sinister servant at his elbow, bowed  low--and left us, surely to the mocking laughter of the gods!          CHAPTER XIV    THE COUGHING HORROR      I leapt up in bed with a great start.    My sleep was troubled often enough in those days which immediately  followed our almost miraculous escape from the den of Fu-Manchu; and  now, as I crouched there, nerves aquiver--listening--listening--I  could not be sure if this dank panic which possessed me had its origin  in nightmare or in something else.    Surely a scream, a choking cry for help, had reached my ears; but now,  almost holding my breath in that sort of nervous tensity peculiar to  one aroused thus, I listened, and the silence seemed complete. Perhaps  I had been dreaming....    \"Help! Petrie! _Help_!...\"    It was Nayland Smith in the room above me!    My doubts were resolved; this was no trick of an imagination  disordered. Some dreadful menace threatened my friend. Not delaying  even to snatch my dressing-gown, I rushed out on to the landing, up  the stairs, bare-footed as I was, threw open the door of Smith's room  and literally hurled myself in.    Those cries had been the cries of one assailed, had been uttered, I  judged, in the brief interval of a life and death struggle; had been  choked off....    A certain amount of moonlight found access to the room, without  spreading so far as the bed in which my friend lay. But at the moment  of my headlong entrance, and before I had switched on the light, my  gaze automatically was directed to the pale moonbeam streaming through  the window and down on to one corner of the sheep skin rug beside the  bed.    There came a sound of faint and muffled coughing,    What with my recent awakening and the panic at my heart, I could not  claim that my vision was true; but across this moonbeam passed a sort  of grey streak, for all the world as though some long thin shape had  been withdrawn, snakelike, from the room, through the open window....  From somewhere outside the house, and below, I heard the cough again,  followed by a sharp cracking sound like the lashing of a whip.    I depressed the switch, flooding the room with light, and as I leapt  forward to the bed a word picture of what I had seen formed in my  mind; and I found that I was thinking of a grey feather boa.    \"Smith!\" I cried (my voice seemed to pitch itself, unwilled, in a very  high key), \"Smith, old man!\"    He made no reply, and a sudden, sorrowful fear clutched at my  heart-strings. He was lying half out of bed flat upon his back, his  head at a dreadful angle with his body. As I bent over him and seized  him by the shoulders, I could see the whites of his eyes. His arms  hung limply, and his fingers touched the carpet.    \"My God!\" I whispered, \"what has happened?\"    I heaved him back on to the pillow, and looked anxiously into his  face. Habitually gaunt, the flesh so refined away by the consuming  nervous energy of the man as to reveal the cheekbones in sharp  prominence, he now looked truly ghastly. His skin was so sun-baked as  to have changed constitutionally; nothing could ever eradicate that  tan. But to-night a fearful greyness was mingled with the brown, his  lips were purple ... and there were marks of strangulation upon the  lean throat--ever darkening weals of clutching fingers.    He began to breathe stertorously and convulsively, inhalation being  accompanied by a significant gurgle in the throat. But now my calm was  restored in face of a situation which called for professional  attention.    I aided my friend's laboured respirations by the usual means, setting  to work vigorously; so that presently he began to clutch at his  inflamed throat which that murderous pressure had threatened to close.    I could hear sounds of movements about the house, showing that not I  alone had been awakened by those hoarse screams.    \"It's all right, old man,\" I said, bending over him: \"brace up!\"    He opened his eyes--they looked bleared and bloodshot--and gave me a  quick glance of recognition.    \"It's all right, Smith!\" I said--\"no! don't sit up; lie there for a  moment.\"    I ran across to the dressing-table, whereon I perceived his flask to  lie, and mixed him a weak stimulant with which I returned to the bed.    As I bent over him again, my housekeeper appeared in the doorway, pale  and wide-eyed.    \"There is no occasion for alarm,\" I said over my shoulder; \"Mr.  Smith's nerves are overwrought and he was awakened by some disturbing  dream. You can return to bed, Mrs. Newsome.\"    Nayland Smith seemed to experience much difficulty in swallowing the  contents of the tumbler which I held to his lips; and, from the way in  which he fingered the swollen glands, I could see that his throat,  which I had vigorously massaged, was occasioning him great pain. But  the danger was past, and already that glassy look was disappearing  from his eyes, nor did they protrude so unnaturally.    \"God, Petrie!\" he whispered, \"that was a near shave! I haven't the  strength of a kitten!\"    \"The weakness will pass off,\" I replied; \"there will be no collapse,  now. A little more fresh air....\"    I stood up, glancing at the windows, then back at Smith, who forced a  wry smile in answer to my look.    \"Couldn't be done, Petrie,\" he said huskily.    His words referred to the state of the windows. Although the night was  oppressively hot, these were only opened some four inches at top and  bottom. Farther opening was impossible because of iron brackets  screwed firmly into the casements, which prevented the windows being  raised or lowered farther.    It was a precaution adopted after long experience of the servants of  Dr. Fu-Manchu.    Now, as I stood looking from the half-strangled man upon the bed to  those screwed-up windows, the fact came home to my mind that this  precaution had proved futile. I thought of the thing which I had  likened to a feather boa; and I looked at the swollen weals made by  clutching fingers upon the throat of Nayland Smith.    The bed stood fully four feet from the nearest window.    I suppose the question was written in my face; for, as I turned again  to Smith, who, having struggled upright, was still fingering his  injured throat ruefully--\"God only knows, Petrie!\" he said; \"no human  arm could have reached me....\"    For us, the night was ended so far as sleep was concerned. Arrayed in  his dressing-gown, Smith sat in the white cane chair in my study with  a glass of brandy and water beside him, and (despite my official  prohibition) with the cracked briar, which had sent up its incense in  many strange and dark places of the East and which yet survived to  perfume these prosy rooms in suburban London, between his teeth. I  stood with my elbow resting upon the mantelpiece looking down at him  where he sat.    \"By God! Petrie,\" he said, yet again, with his fingers straying gently  over the surface of his throat, \"that was a narrow shave--a damned  narrow shave!\"    \"Narrower than perhaps you appreciate, old man,\" I replied. \"You were  a most unusual shade of blue when I found you....\"    \"I managed,\" said Smith evenly, \"to tear those clutching fingers away  for a moment and to give a cry for help. It was only for a moment,  though. Petrie! they were fingers of steel--of steel!\"    \"The bed....\" I began.    \"I know that,\" rapped Smith. \"I shouldn't have been sleeping in it,  had it been within reach of the window; but, knowing that the Doctor  avoids noisy methods, I had thought myself fairly safe so long as I  made it impossible for any one actually to enter the room....\"    \"I have always insisted, Smith,\" I cried, \"that there was danger! What  of poisoned darts? What of the damnable reptiles and insects which  form part of the armoury of Fu-Manchu?\"    \"Familiarity breeds contempt, I suppose,\" he replied. \"But as it  happened, none of those agents was employed. The very menace that I  sought to avoid reached me somehow. It would almost seem that Dr.  Fu-Manchu deliberately accepted the challenge of those screwed up  windows! Hang it all, Petrie! one cannot sleep in a room hermetically  sealed in weather like this! It's positively Burmese; and although I  can stand tropical heat, curiously enough the heat of London gets me  down almost immediately.\"    \"The humidity; that's easily understood. But you'll have to put up  with it in the future. After nightfall our windows must be closed  entirely, Smith.\"    Nayland Smith knocked out his pipe upon the side of the fireplace. The  bowl sizzled furiously, but without delay he stuffed broad-cut mixture  into the hot pipe, dropping a liberal quantity upon the carpet during  the process. He raised his eyes to me, and his face was very grim.    \"Petrie,\" he said, striking a match on the heel of his slipper, \"the  resources of Dr. Fu-Manchu are by no means exhausted. Before we quit  this room it is up to us to come to a decision upon a certain point.\"  He got his pipe well alight. \"What kind of thing, what unnatural,  distorted creature, laid hands upon my throat to-night? I owe my life,  primarily, to you, old man, but secondarily, to the fact "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#18)"],[1,"  crossing that shelf across the bed, they might hope to put water between  them and the unknown enemy tonight. It would give them a breathing  space, even though Ross privately shrank from the thought of plowing  into the stream. He had seen good-sized trees swirling along in the  current only yesterday. And to make such a dash in the dark....    From McNeil's throat burst a startling sound which Ross had last heard  in Britain--the questing howl of a hunting wolf. The cry was answered  seconds later from downstream.    \"Ashe!\"    They worked their way along the edge of the water with continued care,  until they came upon Ashe at last, so much a part of his background that  Ross started when the lump he had taken for a bush hunched forward to  join them. Together they made the river crossing and turned south again  to head for the mountains. It was then that disaster struck.    Ross heard no birdcall warning this time. Though he was on guard, he  never sensed the approach of the man who struck him down from behind.  One moment he had been trailing McNeil and Ashe; the next moment was  black nothingness.    He was aware of a throb of pain which carried throughout his body and  then localized in his head. Forcing open his eyes, the dazzle of light  was like a spear point striking directly into his head, intensifying his  pain to agony. He brought his hand up to his face and felt stickiness  there.    \"Assha--\" He believed he called that aloud, but he did not even hear his  own voice. They were in a valley; a wolf had attacked him out of the  bushes. Wolf? No, the wolf was dead, but then it came alive again to  howl on a river bank.    Ross forced his eyes open once more, enduring the pain of beams he  recognized as sunshine. He turned his head to avoid the glare. It was  hard to focus, but he fought to steady himself. There was some reason  why it was necessary to move, to get away. But away from what and where?  When Ross tried to think he could only see muddled pictures which had no  connection.    Then a moving object crossed his very narrow field of vision, passing  between him and a thing he knew was a tree trunk. A four-footed creature  with a red tongue hanging from its jaws. It came toward him  stiff-legged, growling low in its throat, and sniffed at his body before  barking in short excited bursts of sound.    The noise hurt his head so much that Ross closed his eyes. Then a shock  of icy liquid thrown into his face aroused him to make a feeble protest  and he saw, hanging over him in a strange upside-down way, a bearded  face which he knew from the past.    Hands were laid on him and the roughness with which he was moved sent  Ross spiraling back into the dark once again. When he aroused for the  second time it was night and the pain in his head was dulled. He put out  his hands and discovered that he lay on a pile of fur robes, and was  covered by one.    \"Assha--\" Again he tried that name. But it was not Assha who came in  answer to his feeble call. The woman who knelt beside him with a horn  cup in her hand had neatly braided hair in which gray strands showed  silver by firelight. Ross knew he had seen her before, but again where  and when eluded him. She slipped a sturdy arm under his head and raised  him while the world whirled about. The edge of the horn cup was pressed  to his lips, and he drank bitter stuff which burned in his throat and  lit a fire in his insides. Then he was left to himself once again and in  spite of his pain and bewilderment he slept.    How many days he lay in the camp of Ulffa, tended by the chief's head  wife, Ross found it hard to reckon. It was Frigga who had argued the  tribe into caring for a man they believed almost dead when they found  him, and who nursed Ross back to life with knowledge acquired through  half a hundred exchanges between those wise women who were the doctors  and priestesses of these roaming peoples.    Why Frigga had bothered with the injured stranger at all Ross learned  when he was able to sit up and marshal his bewildered thoughts into some  sort of order. The matriarch of the tribe thirsted for knowledge. That  same urge which had led her to certain experiments with herbs, had made  her consider Ross a challenge to her healing skill. When she knew that  he would live she determined to learn from him all he had to give.    Ulffa and the men of the tribe might have eyed the metal weapons of the  traders with awe and avid desire, but Frigga wanted more than trade  goods. She wanted the secret of the making of such cloth as the  strangers wore, everything she could learn of their lives and the lands  through which they had come. She plied Ross with endless questions which  he answered as best he could, for he lay in an odd dreamy state where  only the present had any reality. The past was dim and far away, and  while he was now and then dimly aware that he had something to do, he  forgot it easily.    The chief and his men prowled the half-built station after the attackers  had withdrawn, bringing back with them a handful of loot--a bronze  razor, two skinning knives, some fishhooks, a length of cloth which  Frigga appropriated. Ross eyed this spoil indifferently, making no claim  upon it. His interest in everything about him was often blanked out by  headaches which kept him limp on his bed, uncaring and stupid for hours  or even full days.    He gathered that the tribe had been living in fear of an attack from the  same raiders who had wiped out the trading post. But at last their  scouts returned with the information that the enemy had gone south.    There was one change of which Ross was not aware but which might have  startled both Ashe and McNeil. Ross Murdock had indeed died under that  blow which had left him unconscious beside the river. The young man whom  Frigga had drawn back to sense and a slow recovery was Rossa of the  Beaker people. This same Rossa nursed a hot desire for vengeance against  those who had struck him down and captured his kinsmen, a feeling which  the family tribe who had rescued him could well understand.    There was the same old urgency pushing him to try his strength now, to  keep to his feet even when they were unsteady. His bow was gone, but  Ross spent hours fashioning another, and he traded his copper bracelet  for the best dozen arrows in Ulffa's camp. The jet pin from his cloak he  presented to Frigga with all his gratitude.    Now that his strength was coming back he could not rest easy in the  camp. He was ready to leave, even though the gashes on his head were  still tender to the touch. Ulffa indulgently planned a hunt southward,  and Rossa took the trail with the tribesmen.    He broke with the clan hunters when they turned aside at the beginning  of the taboo land. Ross, his own mind submerged and taken over by his  Beaker cover, hesitated too. Yet he could not give up, and the others  left him there, his eyes on the forbidden heights, unhappy and tormented  by more than the headaches which still came and went with painful  regularity. In the mountains lay what he sought--a hidden something  within his brain told him that over and over--but the mountains were  taboo, and he should not venture into them.    How long he might have hesitated there if he had not come upon the  trail, Ross did not know. But on the day after the hunters of Ulffa's  clan left, a glint of sunlight striking between two trees pointed out a  woodsman's blaze on a third tree trunk. The two halves of Ross's memory  clicked together for an instant as he examined that cut. He knew that it  marked a trace and he pushed on, hunting a second cut and then a third.  Convinced that these would lead him into the unknown territory, Ross's  desire to explore overcame the grafted superstitions of his briefing.    There were other signs that this was an often-traveled route: a spring  cleared of leaves and walled with stone, a couple of steps cut in the  turf on a steep slope. Ross moved warily, alert to any sound. He might  not be an expert woodsman, but he was learning fast, perhaps the faster  because his false memories now supplanted the real ones.    That night he built no fire, crawling instead into the heart of a rotted  log to sleep, awakening once to the call of a wolf and another time at  the distant crash of a dead tree yielding to wind.    In the morning he was about to climb back to the trail he had prudently  left the night before when he saw five bearded, fur-clad men looking  much the same as Ulffa's people. Ross hugged the earth and watched them  pass out of sight before he followed.    All that day he wove an up-and-down trail behind the small band,  sometimes catching sight of them as they topped a rise well ahead or  stopped to eat. It was late afternoon when he crept cautiously to the  top of a ridge and gazed down into a valley.    There was a town in that valley, sturdy houses of logs behind a  stockade. He had seen towns vaguely like it before, yet it had a  dreamlike quality as if it were not as real as it appeared.    Ross rested his chin on his arms and watched that town and the people  moving in it. Some were fur-clad hunters, but others dressed quite  differently. He started up with a little cry at the sight of one of the  men who had walked so swiftly from one house to the next; surely he was  a Beaker trader!    His unease grew stronger with every moment he watched, but it was the  oddness he sensed in that town which bothered him and not any warning  that he, himself, was in danger. He had gotten to his knees to see  better when out of nowhere a rope sang through the air, settling about  his chest with a vicious jerk which not only drove the air from his  lungs but pinioned his arms tight to his body.          CHAPTER 10      Having been cuffed and battered into submission more quickly than would  have been possible three weeks earlier, Murdock now stood sullenly  surveying the man who, though he dressed"]]]
