We may perhaps trace this misleading habit of thought to the influence  of the professors of natural science over the students of Stone Age and  Bronze Age antiquities. Because nature moves by steady progression and  develops on even lines--_nihil facit per sal-tum_--it seems to have been  assumed that the works of man's hands have developed in the same way,  in a regular and even scheme all over the world. On this supposition it  would be impossible for the great discovery of the use of iron to have  been known in Egypt as early as 3500 B.C. for this knowledge to have  remained dormant there for two thousand years, and then to have  been suddenly communicated about 1000 B.C. to Greece, spreading with  lightning-like rapidity over Europe and displacing the use of bronze  everywhere. Yet, as a matter of fact, the work of man does develop  in exactly this haphazard way, by fits and starts and sudden leaps of  progress after millennia of stagnation. Throwsback to barbarism are just  as frequent. The analogy of natural evolution is completely inapplicable  and misleading.    Prof. Montelius, however, following the \"evolutionary\" line of thought,  believed that because iron was not known in Europe till about 1000 B.C.  it could not have been known in Egypt much earlier; and in an important  article which appeared in the Swedish ethnological journal _Ymer_ in  1883, entitled _Bronsaldrn i Egypten_ (\"The Bronze Age in Egypt\"), he  essayed to prove the contrary arguments of the Egyptologists wrong. His  main points were that the colour of the weapons in the frescoes was of  no importance, as it was purely conventional and arbitrary, and that the  evidence of the piece of iron from the Great Pyramid was insufficiently  authenticated, and therefore valueless, in the absence of other definite  archaeological evidence in the shape of iron of supposed early date. To  this article the Swedish Egyptologist, Dr. Piehl, replied in the same  periodical, in an article entitled _Bronsaldem i Egypten_, in which he  traversed Prof. Montelius's conclusions from the Egyptological point of  view, and adduced other instances of the use of iron in Egypt, all,  it is true, later than the time of the IVth Dynasty. But this protest  received little notice, owing to the fact that it remained buried in  a Swedish periodical, while Prof. Montelius's original article was  translated into French, and so became well-known.    For the time Prof. Montelius's conclusions were generally accepted, and  when the discoveries of the prehistoric antiquities were made by M. de  Morgan, it seemed more probable than ever that Egypt had gone through a  regular progressive development from the Age of Stone through those of  copper and bronze to that of iron, which was reached about 1100 or 1000  B.C. The evidence of the iron fragment from the Great Pyramid was put on  one side, in spite of the circumstantial account of its discovery  which had been given by its finders. Even Prof. Petrie, who in 1881  had accepted the pyramid fragment as undoubtedly contemporary with that  building, and had gone so far as to adduce additional evidence for its  authenticity, gave way, and accepted Montelius's view, which held its  own until in 1902 it was directly controverted by a discovery of Prof.  Petrie at Abydos. This discovery consisted of an undoubted fragment of  iron found in conjunction with bronze tools of VIth Dynasty date; and it  settled the matter.* The VIth Dynasty date of this piece of iron, which  was more probably worked than not (since it was buried with tools), was  held to be undoubted by its discoverer and by everybody else, and, if  this were undoubted, the IVth Dynasty date of the Great Pyramid fragment  was also fully established. The discoverers of the earlier fragment had  no doubt whatever as to its being contemporary with the pyramid, and  were supported in this by Prof. Petrie in 1881. Therefore it is now  known to be the fact that iron was used by the Egyptians as early as  3500 B.C.**         * See H. R. Hall's note on \"The Early Use of Iron in Egypt,\"       in _Man_ (the organ of the Anthropological Society of       London), iii (1903), No. 86.         ** Prof. Montelius objected to these conclusions in a review       of the British Museum \"Guide to the Antiquities of the       Bronze Age,\" which was published in Man, 1005 (Jan.), No 7.       For an answer to these objections, see Hall, ibid., No. 40.    It would thus appear that though the Egyptians cannot be said to have  used iron generally and so to have entered the \"Iron Age\" before about  1300 B.C. (reign of Ramses II), yet iron was well known to them and had  been used more than occasionally by them for tools and building purposes  as early as the time of the IVth Dynasty, about 3500 B.C. Certainly  dated examples of its use occur under the IVth, VIth, and XIIIth  Dynasties. Why this knowledge was not communicated to Europe before  about 1000 B.C. we cannot say, nor are Egyptologists called upon to find  the reason. So the Great Pyramid has played an interesting part in the  settlement of a very important question.    It was supposed by Prof. Petrie that the piece of iron from the Great  Pyramid had been part of some arrangement employed for raising the  stones into position. Herodotus speaks of the machines, which were used  to raise the stones, as made of little pieces of wood. The generally  accepted explanation of his meaning used to be that a small crane or  similar wooden machine was used for hoisting the stone by means  of pulley and rope; but M. Legrain, the director of the works of  restoration in the Great Temple of Karnak, has explained it differently.  Among the \"foundation deposits\" of the XVIIIth Dynasty at Der el-Bahari  and elsewhere, beside the little plaques with the king's name and the  model hoes and vases, was usually found an enigmatic wooden object like  a small cradle, with two sides made of semicircular pieces of wood,  joined along the curved portion by round wooden bars. M. Legrain has now  explained this as a model of the machine used to raise heavy stones from  tier to tier of a pyramid or other building, and illustrations of  the method of its use may be found in Choisy's _Art de Batir chez les  anciens Egyptiens_. There is little doubt that this primitive machine  is that to which Herodotus refers as having been used in the erection of  the pyramids.    The later historian, Diodorus, also tells us that great mounds or ramps  of earth were used as well, and that the stones were dragged up these  to the requisite height. There is no doubt that this statement also is  correct. We know that the Egyptians did build in this very way, and  the system has been revived by M. Legrain for his work at Karnak, where  still exist the remains of the actual mounds and ramps by which the  great western pylon was erected in Ptolemaic times. Work carried on  in this way is slow and expensive, but it is eminently suited to the  country and understood by the people. If they wish to put a great stone  architrave weighing many tons across the top of two columns, they do not  hoist it up into position; they rear a great ramp or embankment of earth  against the two pillars, half-burying them in the process, then drag  the architrave up the ramp by means of ropes and men, and put it into  position. Then the ramp is cleared away. This is the ancient system  which is now followed at Karnak, and it is the system by which, with the  further aid of the wooden machines, the Great Pyramid and its compeers  were erected in the days of the IVth Dynasty. _Plus cela change, plus  c'est la meme chose_.    The brick pyramids of the XIIth Dynasty were erected in the same way,  for the Egyptians had no knowledge of the modern combination of wooden  scaffolding and ladders. There was originally a small stone pyramid of  the same dynasty at Dashur, half-way between the two brick ones, but  this has now almost disappeared. It belonged to the king Amenemhat II,  while the others belonged, the northern to Usertsen (Sen-usret) III, the  southern to Amenemhat III. Both these latter monarchs had other tombs  elsewhere, Usertsen a great rock-cut gallery and chamber in the cliff at  Abydos, Amenemhat a pyramid not very far to the south, at Hawara, close  to the Fayyum. It is uncertain whether the Hawara pyramid or that of  Dashur was the real burial-place of the king, as at neither place is his  name found alone. At Hawara it is found in conjunction with that of his  daughter, the queen-regnant Se-bekneferura (Skemiophris), at Dashur with  that of a king Auabra Hor, who was buried in a small tomb near that of  the king, and adjoining the tombs of the king's children. Who King Hor  was we do not quite know. His name is not given in the lists, and was  unknown until M. de Morgan's discoveries at Dashur. It is most probable  that he was a prince who was given royal honours during the lifetime of  Amenemhat III, whom he predeceased.* In the beautiful wooden statue  of him found in his tomb, which is now in the Cairo Museum, he is  represented as quite a youth. Amenemhat III was certainly succeeded by  Amenemhat IV, and it is impossible to intercalate Hor between them.         * See below, p. 121. Possibly he was a son of Amenemhat III.    The identification of the owners of the three western pyramids of Dashur  is due to M. de Morgan and his assistants, Messrs. Legrain and Jequier,  who excavated them from 1894 till 1896. The northern pyramid, that of  Usertsen (Senusret) III, is not so well preserved as the southern. It is  more worn away, and does not present so imposing an appearance. In  both pyramids the outer casing of white stone has entirely disappeared,  leaving only the bare black bricks.

The nights were as noisy as the days: for a few hours, they made up  energetically for long months of torpor and monotonous existence. The  god having re-entered the temple and the pilgrims taken their departure,  the regular routine was resumed and dragged on its tedious course,  interrupted only by the weekly market. At an early hour on that day,  the peasant folk came in from the surrounding country in an interminable  stream, and installed themselves in some open space, reserved from time  immemorial for their use. The sheep, geese, goats, and large-horned  cattle were grouped in the centre, awaiting purchasers.  Market-gardeners, fishermen, fowlers and gazelle-hunters, potters, and  small tradesmen, squatted on the roadsides or against the houses, and  offered their wares for the inspection of their customers, heaped up  in reed baskets, or piled on low round tables: vegetables and fruits,  loaves or cakes baked during the night, meat either raw or cooked in  various ways, stuffs, perfumes, ornaments,--all the necessities and  luxuries of daily life. It was a good opportunity for the workpeople, as  well as for the townsfolk, to lay in a store of provisions at a cheaper  rate than from the ordinary shops; and they took advantage of it, each  according to his means.    Business was mostly carried on by barter. The purchasers brought with  them some product of their toil--a new tool, a pair of shoes, a reed  mat, pots of unguents or cordials; often, too, rows of cowries and  a small box full of rings, each weighing a \"tabnu,\" made of copper,  silver, or even gold, all destined to be bartered for such things as  they needed. When it came to be a question of some large animal or of  objects of considerable value, the discussions which arose were keen and  stormy: it was necessary to be agreed not only as to the amount, but  as to the nature of the payment to be made, and to draw up a sort of  invoice, or in fact an inventory, in which beds, sticks, honey, oil,  pick-axes, and garments, all figure as equivalents for a bull or  a she-ass. Smaller retail bargains did not demand so many or such  complicated calculations. Two townsfolk stop for a moment in front of  a fellah who offers onions and corn in a basket for sale. The first  appears to possess no other circulating medium than two necklaces  made of glass beads or many-coloured enamelled terra-cotta; the other  flourishes about a circular fan with a wooden handle, and one of those  triangular contrivances used by cooks for blowing up the fire. \"Here is  a fine necklace which will suit you,\" cries the former, \"it is just what  you are wanting;\" while the other breaks in with: \"Here is a fan and a  ventilator.\" The fellah, however, does not let himself be disconcerted  by this double attack, and proceeding methodically, he takes one of the  necklaces to examine it at his leisure: \"Give it to me to look at,  that I may fix the price.\" The one asks too much, the other offers too  little; after many concessions, they at last come to an agreement,  and settle on the number of onions or the quantity of grain which  corresponds exactly with the value of the necklace or the fan. A little  further on, a customer wishes to get some perfumes in exchange for a  pair of sandals, and conscientiously praises his wares: \"Here,\" says  he, \"is a strong pair of shoes.\" But the merchant has no wish to be shod  just then, and demands a row of cowries for his little pots: \"You have  merely to take a few drops of this to see how delicious it is,\" he urges  in a persuasive tone. A seated customer has two jars thrust under his  nose by a woman--they probably contain some kind of unguent: \"Here is  something which smells good enough to tempt you.\" Behind this group two  men are discussing the relative merits of a bracelet and a bundle of  fish-hooks; a woman, with a small box in her hand, is having an argument  with a merchant selling necklaces; another woman seeks to obtain a  reduction in the price of a fish which is being scraped in front of her.  Exchanging commodities for metal necessitated two or three operations  not required in ordinary barter. The rings or thin bent strips of metal  which formed the \"tabnu\" and its multiples,* did not always contain the  regulation amount of gold or silver, and were often of light weight.         * The rings of gold in the Museum at Leyden, which were used       as a basis of exchange, are made on the Chaldaeo-Babylonian       pattern, and belong to the Asiatic system.    [Illustration: 118.jpg one of the forms of egyptian scales]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after a sketch by Rosellini    They had to be weighed at every fresh transaction in order to estimate  their true value, and the interested parties never missed this excellent  opportunity for a heated discussion: after having declared for a quarter  of an hour that the scales were out of order, that the weighing had been  carelessly performed, and that it should be done over again, they at  last came to terms, exhausted with wrangling, and then went their way  fairly satisfied with one another.* It sometimes happened that a clever  and unscrupulous dealer would alloy the rings, and mix with the precious  metal as much of a baser sort as would be possible without danger of  detection. The honest merchant who thought he was receiving in payment  for some article, say eight tabnu of fine gold, and who had handed to  him eight tabnu of some alloy resembling gold, but containing one-third  of silver, lost in a single transaction, without suspecting it, almost  one-third of his goods. The fear of such counterfeits was instrumental  in restraining the use of tabnu for a long time among the people, and  restricted the buying and selling in the markets to exchange in natural  products or manufactured objects.         * The weighing of rings is often represented on the       monuments from the XVIIIth dynasty onwards. I am not       acquainted with any instance of this on the bas-reliefs of       the Ancient Empire. The giving of false weight is alluded to       in the paragraph in the \"Negative Confession,\" in which the       dead man declares that he has not interfered with the beam       of the scales (cf. vol. i. p. 271) _civili,_ pl. lii. 1. As       to the construction of the Egyptian scales, and the working       of their various parts, see Flinders Petrie's remarks in _A       Season in Egypt_, P- 42, and the drawings which he has       brought together on pl. xx. of the same work.      [Illustration: 118b.jpg SCENES IN A BAZAAR]    We must, perhaps, agree with Fr. Lenormant, in his conclusion that the  only kind of national metal of exchange in use in Egypt was a copper  wire or plate bent thus [--]. this being the sign invariably used in the  hieroglyphics in writing the word _tabnu_.    The present rural population of Egypt scarcely ever live in isolated  and scattered farms; they are almost all concentrated in hamlets and  villages of considerable extent, divided into quarters often at some  distance from each other. The same state of things existed in ancient  times, and those who would realize what a village in the past was  like, have only to visit any one of the modern market towns scattered  at intervals along the valley of the Nile:--half a dozen fairly built  houses, inhabited by the principal people of the place; groups of brick  or clay cottages thatched with durra stalks, so low that a man standing  upright almost touches the roof with his head; courtyards filled with  tall circular mud-built sheds, in which the corn and durra for the  household is carefully stored, and wherever we turn, pigeons, ducks,  geese, and animals all living higgledly-piggledly with the family. The  majority of the peasantry were of the lower class, but they were not  everywhere subjected to the same degree of servitude. The slaves,  properly so called, came from other countries; they had been bought from  foreign merchants, or they had been seized in a raid and had lost their  liberty by the fortune of war.* Their master removed them from place  to place, sold them, used them as he pleased, pursued them if they  succeeded in escaping, and had the right of recapturing them as soon as  he received information of their whereabouts. They worked for him under  his overseer's orders, receiving no regular wages, and with no hope of  recovering their liberty.**         * The first allusion to prisoners of war brought back to       Egypt, is found in the biography of Uni. The method in which       they were distributed among the officers and soldiers is       indicated in several inscriptions of the New Empire, in that       of Ahmosis Pannekhabit, in that of Ahmosis si-Abina, where       one of the inscriptions contains a list of slaves, some of       whom are foreigners, in that of Amenemhabi. We may form       some idea of the number of slaves in Egypt from the fact       that in thirty years Ramses III. presented 113,433 of them       to the temples alone. The \"Directors of the Royal Slaves,\"       at all periods, occupied an important position at the court       of the Pharaohs.         ** A scene reproduced by Lepsius shows us, about the time of       the VIth dynasty, the harvest gathered by the \"royal slaves\"       in concert with the tenants of the dead man. One of the       petty princes defeated by the Ethiopian Pionkhi Miamun       proclaims himself to be \"one of the royal slaves who pay       tribute in kind to the royal treasury.\" Amten repeatedly       mentions slaves of this kind, \"sutiu.\"    Many chose concubines from their own class, or intermarried with the  natives and had families: at the end of two or three generations their  descendants became"]]]
