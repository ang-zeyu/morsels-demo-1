[59] Recalled to be redeemed.        [60] This part of Philadelphia is now the center of the      wholesale business district.    Our debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and  printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled \"_The Nature and  Necessity of a Paper Currency_.\" It was well receiv'd by the common  people in general; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'd and  strengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to have no  writers among them that were able to answer it, their opposition  slacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. My  friends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service, thought fit  to reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable  jobb and a great help to me. This was another advantage gain'd by my  being able to write.    The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident  as never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to  fifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds,  since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty  thousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the while  increasing, tho' I now think there are limits beyond which the  quantity may be hurtful.[61]        [61] Paper money is a promise to pay its face value in      gold or silver. When a state or nation issues more such      promises than there is a likelihood of its being able to      redeem, the paper representing the promises depreciates      in value. Before the success of the Colonies in the      Revolution was assured, it took hundreds of dollars of      their paper money to buy a pair of boots.    I soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of the  Newcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;  small things appearing great to those in small circumstances; and  these, to me, were really great advantages, as they were great  encouragements. He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and  votes of that government, which continu'd in my hands as long as I  follow'd the business.    I now open'd a little stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of all  sorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assisted in  that by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen's  books, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an  excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly and  diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquilla Rose.    [Illustration: \"I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas'd at the  stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow\"]    I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the  printing-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a  tradesman, I took care not only to be in _reality_ industrious and  frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly;  I was seen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishing  or shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work, but  that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was  not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas'd  at the stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow. Thus being esteem'd  an industrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought,  the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others  proposed supplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly. In the  meantime, Keimer's credit and business declining daily, he was at last  forc'd to sell his printing-house to satisfy his creditors. He went to  Barbadoes, and there lived some years in very poor circumstances.    His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'd with  him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials.  I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as his  friends were very able, and had a good deal of interest. I therefore  propos'd a partnership to him, which he, fortunately for me, rejected  with scorn. He was very proud, dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd  expensively, took much diversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and  neglected his business; upon which, all business left him; and,  finding nothing to do, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the  printing-house with him. There this apprentice employ'd his former  master as a journeyman; they quarrell'd often; Harry went continually  behindhand, and at length was forc'd to sell his types and return to  his country work in Pennsylvania. The person that bought them employ'd  Keimer to use them, but in a few years he died.    There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old  one, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now and  then by straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business.  However, as he kept the post-office, it was imagined he had better  opportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a better  distributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many more,  which was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for,  tho' I did indeed receive and send papers by the post, yet the publick  opinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders,  who took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it,  which occasion'd some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly  of him for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I took  care never to imitate it.    I had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in part of  my house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop for  his glazier's business, tho' he worked little, being always absorbed  in his mathematics. Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with a  relation's daughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together,  till a serious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl being in herself  very deserving. The old folks encourag'd me by continual invitations  to supper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time to  explain. Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty. I let her know that I  expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my  remaining debt for the printing-house, which I believe was not then  above a hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to  spare; I said they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. The  answer to this, after some days, was, that they did not approve the  match; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been informed the  printing business was not a profitable one; the types would soon be  worn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed one  after the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and,  therefore, I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up.    Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice, on a  supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and  therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at  liberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not; but I  suspected the latter, resented it, and went no more. Mrs. Godfrey  brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their  disposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declared  absolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family.  This was resented by the Godfreys; we differed, and they removed,  leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.    But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd round  me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon found  that, the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, I  was not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I  should not otherwise think agreeable. A friendly correspondence as  neighbours and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs.  Read's family, who all had a regard for me from the time of my first  lodging in their house. I was often invited there and consulted in  their affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti'd poor Miss  Read's unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom  chearful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness and  inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her  unhappiness, tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more  her own than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went  thither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutual  affection was revived, but there were now great objections to our  union. The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife  being said to be living in England; but this could not easily be  prov'd, because of the distance; and, tho' there was a report of his  death, it was not certain. Then, tho' it should be true, he had left  many debts, which his successor might be call'd upon to pay. We  ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her to  wife, September 1st, 1730. None of the inconveniences happened that we  had apprehended; she proved a good and faithful helpmate,[62] assisted  me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have ever  mutually endeavour'd to make each other happy. Thus I corrected that  great _erratum_ as well as I could.        [62] Mrs. Franklin survived her marriage over forty      years. Franklin's correspondence abounds with evidence      that their union was a happy one. \"We are grown old      together, and if she has any faults, I am so used to      them that I don't perceive them.\" The following is a      stanza from one of Franklin's own songs written for the      Junto:          \"Of their Chloes and Phyllises poets may prate,           I sing my plain country Joan,         These twelve years my wife, still the joy of my life,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#18)"],[1,"s. The skin varies also in its sensitivity to _heat_ and _cold_. If  we take a hot or a very cold pencil point and pass it rather lightly and  slowly over the skin, it is easy to discover certain spots from which a  sensation of warmth or of cold flashes out. In this way it is possible  to locate the end-organs of temperature very accurately.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Diagram showing distribution of hot and cold  spots on the back of the hand. C, cold spots; H, hot spots.]    THE KINAESTHETIC SENSES.--The muscles, tendons, and joints also give rise  to perfectly definite sensations, but they have not been named as have  the sensations from most of the other end-organs. _Weight_ is the most  clearly marked of these sensations. It is through the sensations  connected with movements of muscles, tendons, and joints that we come to  judge _form_, _size_, and _distance_.    THE ORGANIC SENSES.--Finally, to the sensations mentioned so far must be  added those which come from the internal organs of the body. From the  alimentary canal we get the sensations of _hunger_, _thirst_, and  _nausea_; from the heart, lungs, and organs of sex come numerous  well-defined but unnamed sensations which play an important part in  making up the feeling-tone of our daily lives.    Thus we see that the senses may be looked upon as the sentries of the  body, standing at the outposts where nature and ourselves meet. They  discover the qualities of the various objects with which we come in  contact and hand them over to the mind in the form of sensations. And  these sensations are the raw material out of which we begin to construct  our material environment. Only as we are equipped with good organs of  sense, especially good eyes and ears, therefore, are we able to enter  fully into the wonderful world about us and receive the stimuli  necessary to our thought and action.      4. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION    1. Observe a schoolroom of children at work with the aim of discovering  any that show defects of vision or hearing. What are the symptoms? What  is the effect of inability to hear or see well upon interest and  attention?    2. Talk with your teacher about testing the eyes and ears of the  children of some school. The simpler tests for vision and hearing are  easily applied, and the expense for material almost nothing. What tests  should be used? Does your school have the test card for vision?    3. Use a rotator or color tops for mixing discs of white and black to  produce different shades of gray. Fix in mind the gray made of half  white and half black; three-fourths white and one-fourth black;  one-fourth-white and three-fourths black.    4. In the same way mix the two complementaries yellow and blue to  produce a gray; mix red and green in the same way. Try various  combinations of the four fundamental colors, and discover how different  colors are produced. Seek for these same colors in nature--sky, leaves,  flowers, etc.    5. Take a large wire nail and push it through a cork so that it can be  handled without touching the metal with the fingers. Now cool it in ice  or very cold water, then dry it and move the point slowly across the  back of the hand. Do you feel occasional thrills of cold as the point  passes over a bulb of Krause? Heat the nail with a match flame or over a  lamp, and perform the same experiment. Do you feel the thrills of heat  from the corpuscles of Ruffini?    6. Try stopping the nostrils with cotton and having someone give you  scraped apple, potato, onion, etc., and see whether, by taste alone, you  can distinguish the difference. Why cannot sulphur be tasted?          CHAPTER VII    PERCEPTION      No young child at first sees objects as we see them, or hears sounds as  we hear them. This power, the power of perception, is a gradual  development. It grows day by day out of the learner's experience in his  world of sights and sounds, and whatever other fields his senses respond  to.      1. THE FUNCTION OF PERCEPTION    NEED OF KNOWING THE MATERIAL WORLD.--It is the business of perception to  give us knowledge of our world of material _objects_ and their relations  in _space_ and _time_. The material world which we enter through the  gateways of the senses is more marvelous by far than any fairy world  created by the fancy of story-tellers; for it contains the elements of  all they have conceived and much more besides. It is more marvelous than  any structure planned and executed by the mind of man; for all the  wonders and beauties of the Coliseum or of St. Peter's existed in nature  before they were discovered by the architect and thrown together in  those magnificent structures. The material advancement of civilization  has been but the discovery of the objects, forces, and laws of nature,  and their use in inventions serviceable to men. And these forces and  laws of nature were discovered only as they were made manifest through  objects in the material world.    The problem lying before each individual who would enter fully into this  rich world of environment, then, is to discover at first hand just as  large a part of the material world about him as possible. In the most  humble environment of the most uneventful life is to be found the  material for discoveries and inventions yet undreamed of. Lying in the  shade of an apple tree under the open sky, Newton read from a falling  apple the fundamental principles of the law of gravitation which has  revolutionized science; sitting at a humble tea table Watt watched the  gurgling of the steam escaping from the kettle, and evolved the steam  engine therefrom; with his simple kite, Franklin drew down the lightning  from the clouds, and started the science of electricity; through  studying a ball, the ancient scholars conceived the earth to be a  sphere, and Columbus discovered America.    THE PROBLEM WHICH CONFRONTS THE CHILD.--Well it is that the child,  starting his life's journey, cannot see the magnitude of the task before  him. Cast amid a world of objects of whose very existence he is  ignorant, and whose meaning and uses have to be learned by slow and  often painful experience, he proceeds step by step through the senses in  his discovery of the objects about him. Yet, considered again, we  ourselves are after all but a step in advance of the child. Though we  are somewhat more familiar with the use of our senses than he, and know  a few more objects about us, yet the knowledge of the wisest of us is at  best pitifully meager compared with the richness of nature. So  impossible is it for us to know all our material environment, that men  have taken to becoming specialists. One man will spend his life in the  study of a certain variety of plants, while there are hundreds of  thousands of varieties all about him; another will study a particular  kind of animal life, perhaps too minute to be seen with the naked eye,  while the world is teeming with animal forms which he has not time in  his short day of life to stop to examine; another will study the land  forms and read the earth's history from the rocks and geological strata,  but here again nature's volume is so large that he has time to read but  a small fraction of the whole. Another studies the human body and learns  to read from its expressions the signs of health and sickness, and to  prescribe remedies for its ills; but in this field also he has found it  necessary to divide the work, and so we have specialists for almost  every organ of the body.      2. THE NATURE OF PERCEPTION    HOW A PERCEPT IS FORMED.--How, then, do we proceed to the discovery of  this world of objects? Let us watch the child and learn the secret from  him. Give the babe a ball, and he applies every sense to it to discover  its qualities. He stares at it, he takes it in his hands and turns it  over and around, he lifts it, he strokes it, he punches it and jabs it,  he puts it to his mouth and bites it, he drops it, he throws it and  creeps after it. He leaves no stone unturned to find out what that thing  really is. By means of the _qualities_ which come to him through the  avenues of sense, he constructs the _object_. And not only does he come  to know the ball as a material object, but he comes to know also its  uses. He is forming his own best definition of a ball in terms of the  sensations which he gets from it and the uses to which he puts it, and  all this even before he can name it or is able to recognize its name  when he hears it. How much better his method than the one he will have  to follow a little later when he goes to school and learns that \"A ball  is a spherical body of any substance or size, used to play with, as by  throwing, kicking, or knocking, etc.!\"    THE PERCEPT INVOLVES ALL RELATIONS OF THE OBJECT.--Nor is the case in  the least different with ourselves. When we wish to learn about a new  object or discover new facts about an old one, we do precisely as the  child does if we are wise. We apply to it every sense to which it will  afford a stimulus, and finally arrive at the object through its various  qualities. And just in so far as we have failed to use in connection  with it every sense to which it can minister, just in that degree will  we have an incomplete perception of it. Indeed, just so far as we have  failed finally to perceive it in terms of its functions or uses, in that  far also have we failed to know it completely. Tomatoes were for many  years grown as ornamental garden plants before it was discovered that  the tomatoes could minister to the taste as well as to the sight. The  clothing of civilized man gives the same sensation of texture and color  to the savage that it does to its owner, but he is so far from  perceiving it in the same way that he packs it away and continues to go  naked. The Orientals, who disdain the use of chairs and prefer to sit  cross-legged on the floor, can never perceive a chair just as we do who  use chairs daily, and to whom"]]]
