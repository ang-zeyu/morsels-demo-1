Neither the Merrimac nor the Monitor could dispose  of its antagonist. The ram's guns could not damage the turret, and the  Monitor was able dexterously to avoid the stroke of the formidable  prow. On the other hand, the shot of the Monitor could not penetrate the  Merrimac's tough sides. Accordingly, fierce though the struggle was, and  much though there was that hinged on it, it was not bloody in character.  The Merrimac could neither destroy nor evade the Monitor. She could not  sink her when she tried to, and when she abandoned her and turned to  attack one of the other wooden vessels, the little turreted ship was  thrown across her path, so that the fight had to be renewed. Both sides  grew thoroughly exhausted, and finally the battle ceased by mutual  consent.    Nothing more could be done. The ram was badly damaged, and there was  no help for her save to put back to the port whence she had come. Twice  afterward she came out, but neither time did she come near enough to the  Monitor to attack her, and the latter could not move off where she would  cease to protect the wooden vessels. The ram was ultimately blown up by  the Confederates on the advance of the Union army.    Tactically, the fight was a drawn battle--neither ship being able to  damage the other, and both ships, being fought to a standstill; but  the moral and material effects were wholly in favor of the Monitor. Her  victory was hailed with exultant joy throughout the whole Union, and  exercised a correspondingly depressing effect in the Confederacy; while  every naval man throughout the world, who possessed eyes to see, saw  that the fight in Hampton Roads had inaugurated a new era in ocean  warfare, and that the Monitor and Merrimac, which had waged so gallant  and so terrible a battle, were the first ships of the new era, and that  as such their names would be forever famous.          THE FLAG-BEARER         Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;       He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are       stored;       He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;          His truth is marching on.         I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;       They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;       I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;          His day is marching on.         He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never beat retreat;       He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat;       Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer him! be jubilant, my feet!          Our God is marching on.                       --Julia Ward Howe.      In no war since the close of the great Napoleonic struggles has the  fighting been so obstinate and bloody as in the Civil War. Much has  been said in song and story of the resolute courage of the Guards  at Inkerman, of the charge of the Light Brigade, and of the terrible  fighting and loss of the German armies at Mars La Tour and Gravelotte.  The praise bestowed, upon the British and Germans for their valor, and  for the loss that proved their valor, was well deserved; but there were  over one hundred and twenty regiments, Union and Confederate, each of  which, in some one battle of the Civil War, suffered a greater loss than  any English regiment at Inkerman or at any other battle in the Crimea,  a greater loss than was suffered by any German regiment at Gravelotte or  at any other battle of the Franco-Prussian war. No European regiment in  any recent struggle has suffered such losses as at Gettysburg befell the  1st Minnesota, when 82 per cent. of the officers and men were killed and  wounded; or the 141st Pennsylvania, which lost 76 per cent.; or the 26th  North Carolina, which lost 72 per cent.; such as at the second battle  of Manassas befell the 101st New York, which lost 74 per cent., and  the 21st Georgia, which lost 76 per cent. At Cold Harbor the 25th  Massachusetts lost 70 per cent., and the 10th Tennessee at Chickamauga  68 per cent.; while at Shiloh the 9th Illinois lost 63 per cent., and  the 6th Mississippi 70 per cent.; and at Antietam the 1st Texas lost  82 percent. The loss of the Light Brigade in killed and wounded in its  famous charge at Balaklava was but 37 per cent.    These figures show the terrible punishment endured by these  regiments, chosen at random from the head of the list which shows the  slaughter-roll of the Civil War. Yet the shattered remnants of each  regiment preserved their organization, and many of the severest losses  were incurred in the hour of triumph, and not of disaster. Thus, the 1st  Minnesota, at Gettysburg, suffered its appalling loss while charging a  greatly superior force, which it drove before it; and the little huddle  of wounded and unwounded men who survived their victorious charge  actually kept both the flag they had captured and the ground from which  they had driven their foes.    A number of the Continental regiments under Washington, Greene, and  Wayne did valiant fighting and endured heavy punishment. Several of the  regiments raised on the northern frontier in 1814 showed, under Brown  and Scott, that they were able to meet the best troops of Britain on  equal terms in the open, and even to overmatch them in fair fight with  the bayonet. The regiments which, in the Mexican war, under the lead of  Taylor, captured Monterey, and beat back Santa Anna at Buena Vista, or  which, with Scott as commander, stormed Molino Del Rey and Chapultepec,  proved their ability to bear terrible loss, to wrest victory from  overwhelming numbers, and to carry by open assault positions of  formidable strength held by a veteran army. But in none of these three  wars was the fighting so resolute and bloody as in the Civil War.    Countless deeds of heroism were performed by Northerner and by  Southerner, by officer and by private, in every year of the great  struggle. The immense majority of these deeds went unrecorded, and  were known to few beyond the immediate participants. Of those that were  noticed it would be impossible even to make a dry catalogue in ten such  volumes as this. All that can be done is to choose out two or three acts  of heroism, not as exceptions, but as examples of hundreds of others.  The times of war are iron times, and bring out all that is best as well  as all that is basest in the human heart. In a full recital of the civil  war, as of every other great conflict, there would stand out in naked  relief feats of wonderful daring and self-devotion, and, mixed among  them, deeds of cowardice, of treachery, of barbarous brutality. Sadder  still, such a recital would show strange contrasts in the careers of  individual men, men who at one time acted well and nobly, and at another  time ill and basely. The ugly truths must not be blinked, and the  lessons they teach should be set forth by every historian, and learned  by every statesman and soldier; but, for our good fortune, the lessons  best worth learning in the nation's past are lessons of heroism.    From immemorial time the armies of every warlike people have set the  highest value upon the standards they bore to battle. To guard one's own  flag against capture is the pride, to capture the flag of one's enemy  the ambition, of every valiant soldier. In consequence, in every war  between peoples of good military record, feats of daring performed  by color-bearers are honorably common. The Civil War was full of such  incidents. Out of very many two or three may be mentioned as noteworthy.    One occurred at Fredericksburg on the day when half the brigades  of Meagher and Caldwell lay on the bloody slope leading up to the  Confederate entrenchments. Among the assaulting regiments was the 5th  New Hampshire, and it lost one hundred and eighty-six out of three  hundred men who made the charge. The survivors fell sullenly back behind  a fence, within easy range of the Confederate rifle-pits. Just before  reaching it the last of the color guard was shot, and the flag fell  in the open. A Captain Perry instantly ran out to rescue it, and as he  reached it was shot through the heart; another, Captain Murray, made  the same attempt and was also killed; and so was a third, Moore. Several  private soldiers met a like fate. They were all killed close to the  flag, and their dead bodies fell across one another. Taking advantage of  this breastwork, Lieutenant Nettleton crawled from behind the fence to  the colors, seized them, and bore back the blood-won trophy.    Another took place at Gaines' Mill, where Gregg's 1st South Carolina  formed part of the attacking force. The resistance was desperate, and  the fury of the assault unsurpassed. At one point it fell to the lot of  this regiment to bear the brunt of carrying a certain strong position.  Moving forward at a run, the South Carolinians were swept by a fierce  and searching fire. Young James Taylor, a lad of sixteen, was carrying  the flag, and was killed after being shot down three times, twice rising  and struggling onward with the colors. The third time he fell the flag  was seized by George Cotchet, and when he, in turn, fell, by Shubrick  Hayne. Hayne was also struck down almost immediately, and the fourth  lad, for none of them were over twenty years old, grasped the colors,  and fell mortally wounded across the body of his friend. The fifth,  Gadsden Holmes, was pierced with no less than seven balls. The sixth  man, Dominick Spellman, more fortunate, but not less brave, bore the  flag throughout the rest of the battle.    Yet another occurred at Antietam. The 7th Maine, then under the command  of Major T. W. Hyde, was one of the hundreds of regiments that on many  hard-fought fields established a reputation for dash and unyielding  endurance. Toward the early part of the day at Antietam it merely took  its share in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#18)"],[1,"surprise, when  the bloodthirsty animal appeared, instead of bounding up to tear her in  pieces, he began to make a soft purring noise. He did not try to hurt  Kwan-yin, but rubbed against her in a friendly manner, and let her pat  him on the head.    [Illustration: \"ALL DAY SHE WAS BUSY CARRYING WATER.\"]    The next day the princess went back to the same spot. There she found  no fewer than a dozen savage beasts working under the command of the  friendly tiger, gathering wood for her. In a short time enough brush and  firewood had been piled up to last the convent for six months. Thus,  even the wild animals of the forest were better able to judge of her  goodness than the women of the sisterhood.    At another time when Kwan-yin was toiling up the hill for the twentieth  time, carrying two great pails of water on a pole, an enormous dragon  faced her in the road. Now, in China, the dragon is sacred, and Kwan-yin  was not at all frightened, for she knew that she had done no wrong.    The animal looked at her for a moment, switched its horrid tail, and  shot out fire from its nostrils. Then, dashing the burden from the  startled maiden's shoulder, it vanished. Full of fear, Kwan-yin hurried  up the hill to the nunnery. As she drew near the inner court, she was  amazed to see in the centre of the open space a new building of solid  stone. It had sprung up by magic since her last journey down the hill.  On going forward, she saw that there were four arched doorways to the  fairy house. Above the door facing west was a tablet with these words  written on it: \"In honour of Kwan-yin, the faithful princess.\" Inside  was a well of the purest water, while, for drawing this water, there a  strange machine, the like of which neither Kwan-yin nor the nuns had  ever seen.    The sisters knew that this magic well was a monument to Kwan-yin's  goodness. For a few days they treated her much better. \"Since the gods  have dug a well at our very gate,\" they said, \"this girl will no longer  need to bear water from the foot of the hill. For what strange reason,  however, did the gods write this beggar's name on the stone?\"    Kwan-yin heard their unkind remarks in silence. She could have explained  the meaning of the dragon's gift, but she chose to let her companions  remain in ignorance. At last the selfish nuns began to grow careless  again, and treated her even worse than before. They could not bear to  see the poor girl enjoy a moment's idleness.    \"This is a place for work,\" they told her. \"All of us have laboured hard  to win our present station. You must do likewise.\" So they robbed her of  every chance for study and prayer, and gave her no credit for the magic  well.    One night the sisters were awakened from their sleep by strange noises,  and soon they heard outside the walls of the compound the blare of a  trumpet. A great army had been sent by Kwan-yin's father to attack the  convent, for his spies had at last been able to trace the runaway  princess to this holy retreat.    \"Oh, who has brought this woe upon us?\" exclaimed all the women, looking  at each other in great fear. \"Who has done this great evil? There is one  among us who has sinned most terribly, and now the gods are about to  destroy us.\" They gazed at one another, but no one thought of Kwan-yin,  for they did not believe her of enough importance to attract the anger  of heaven, even though she might have done the most shocking of deeds.  Then, too, she had been so meek and lowly while in their holy order that  they did not once dream of charging her with any crime.    The threatening sounds outside grew louder and louder. All at once a  fearful cry arose among the women: \"They are about to burn our sacred  dwelling.\" Smoke was rising just beyond the enclosure where the soldiers  were kindling a great fire, the heat of which would soon be great enough  to make the convent walls crumble into dust.    Suddenly a voice was heard above the tumult of the weeping sisters:  \"Alas! I am the cause of all this trouble.\"    The nuns, turning in amazement, saw that it was Kwan-yin who was  speaking. \"You?\" they exclaimed, astounded.    \"Yes, I, for I am indeed the daughter of a king. My father did not wish  me to take the vows of this holy order. I fled from the palace. He has  sent his army here to burn these buildings and to drag me back a  prisoner.\"    \"Then, see what you have brought upon us, miserable girl!\" exclaimed the  abbess. \"See how you have repaid our kindness! Our buildings will be  burned above our heads! How wretched you have made us! May heaven's  curses rest upon you!\"    \"No, no!\" exclaimed Kwan-yin, springing up, and trying to keep the  abbess from speaking these frightful words. \"You have no right to say  that, for I am innocent of evil. But, wait! You shall soon see whose  prayers the gods will answer, yours or mine!\" So saying, she pressed her  forehead to the floor, praying the almighty powers to save the convent  and the sisters.    Outside the crackling of the greedy flames could already be heard. The  fire king would soon destroy every building on that hill-top. Mad with  terror, the sisters prepared to leave the compound and give up all their  belongings to the cruel flames and still more cruel soldiers. Kwan-yin  alone remained in the room, praying earnestly for help.    Suddenly a soft breeze sprang up from the neighbouring forest, dark  clouds gathered overhead, and, although it was the dry season a  drenching shower descended on the flames. Within five minutes the fire  was put out and the convent was saved. Just as the shivering nuns were  thanking Kwan-yin for the divine help she had brought them, two soldiers  who had scaled the outer wall of the compound came in and roughly asked  for the princess.    The trembling girl, knowing that these men were obeying her father's  orders, poured out a prayer to the gods, and straightway made herself  known. They dragged her from the presence of the nuns who had just begun  to love her. Thus disgraced before her father's army, she was taken to  the capital.    On the morrow, she was led before the old king. The father gazed sadly  at his daughter, and then the stern look of a judge hardened his face as  he beckoned the guards to bring her forward.    From a neighbouring room came the sounds of sweet music. A feast was  being served there amid great splendour. The loud laughter of the guests  reached the ears of the young girl as she bowed in disgrace before her  father's throne. She knew that this feast had been prepared for her, and  that her father was willing to give her one more chance.    \"Girl,\" said the king, at last regaining his voice, \"in leaving the  royal palace on the eve of your wedding day, not only did you insult  your father, but your king. For this act you deserve to die. However,  because of the excellent record you had made for yourself before you ran  away, I have decided to give you one more chance to redeem yourself.  Refuse me, and the penalty is death: obey me, and all may yet be  well--the kingdom that you spurned is still yours for the asking. All  that I require is your marriage to the man whom I have chosen.\"    \"And when, most august King, would you have me decide?\" asked Kwan-yin  earnestly.    \"This very day, this very hour, this very moment,\" he answered sternly.  \"What! would you hesitate between love upon a throne and death? Speak,  my daughter, tell me that you love me and will do my bidding!\"    It was now all that Kwan-yin could do to keep from throwing herself at  her father's feet and yielding to his wishes, not because he offered her  a kingdom, but because she loved him and would gladly have made him  happy. But her strong will kept her from relenting. No power on earth  could have stayed her from doing what she thought her duty.    \"Beloved father,\" she answered sadly, and her voice was full of  tenderness, \"it is not a question of my love for you--of that there is  no question, for all my life I have shown it in every action. Believe  me, if I were free to do your bidding, gladly would I make you happy,  but a voice from the gods has spoken, has commanded that I remain a  virgin, that I devote my life to deeds of mercy. When heaven itself has  commanded, what can even a princess do but listen to that power which  rules the earth?\"    The old king was far from satisfied with Kwan-yin's answer. He grew  furious, his thin wrinkled skin turned purple as the hot blood rose to  his head. \"Then you refuse to do my bidding! Take her, men! Give to her  the death that is due to a traitor to the king!\" As they bore Kwan-yin  away from his presence the white-haired monarch fell, swooning, from his  chair.    That night, when Kwan-yin was put to death, she descended into the lower  world of torture. No sooner had she set foot in that dark country of the  dead than the vast region of endless punishment suddenly blossomed forth  and became like the gardens of Paradise. Pure white lilies sprang up on  every side, and the odour of a million flowers filled all the rooms and  corridors. King Yama, ruler of the dominion, rushed forth to learn the  cause of this wonderful change. No sooner did his eyes rest upon the  fair young face of Kwan-yin than he saw in her the emblem of a purity  which deserved no home but heaven.    \"Beautiful virgin, doer of many mercies,\" he began, after addressing  her by her title, \"I beg you in the name of justice to depart from this  bloody kingdom. It is not right that the fairest flower of heaven should  enter and shed her fragrance in these halls. Guilt must suffer here, and  sin find no reward. Depart thou, then, from my dominion. The peach of  immortal life shall be bestowed upon you, and heaven alone shall be your  dwelling place.\"    Thus Kwan-yin became the Goddess of Mercy; thus she entered into that  glad abode, surpassing all earthly kings and queens. And ever since that  time, on account of her exceeding goodness,"]]]
