Colonel Roosevelt certainly didn't look dead. If ever a man looked  rugged and healthy and in splendid physical condition he certainly did  on the day that this despatch reached him. His cheeks were burned to a  ruddy tan and his eyes were as clear as a plainsman's. He laughed and  joked and commented on the news that we told him with all the enthusiasm  of one who knows no physical cares or worries.    [Drawing: _Reading the Report That He Had Been Killed_]    \"If I could have seen you an hour and a half ago,\" he told Akeley, \"I  could have got you the elephants you want for your group. We passed  within only a few yards of a herd of ten this morning, and Kermit got  within thirty yards to make some photographs.\" They had not shot any,  however, as they had received no answer to the letter sent several days  before to Mr. Akeley and consequently did not know positively that his  party had reached the plateau.    The colonel asked about George Ade, commented vigorously and with  prophetic insight on the Cook-Peary controversy, and read aloud, in  excellent dialect, a Dooley article on the subject, which I had saved  from an old copy of the Chicago _Tribune_. He commented very frankly,  with no semblance at hypocrisy, on Mr. Harriman's death, told many of  his experiences in the hunting field, and for three hours, at lunch and  afterward, he talked with the freedom of one who was glad to see some  American friends in the wilderness and who had no objection to showing  his pleasure at such a meeting.    He talked about the tariff and about many public men and public  questions with a frankness that compels even a newspaper man to regard  as being confidential. Our _safari_ was the only one he had met in the  field since he had been in Africa, and it was evident that the efforts  of the protectorate officials to save him from interference and  intrusion had been successful.    Arrangements were then made for an elephant hunt. Colonel Roosevelt was  working on schedule time, and had planned to be in Sergoi on the  seventeenth. He agreed to a hunt that should cover the fifteenth,  sixteenth, and possibly the seventeenth, trusting that they might be  successful in this period and that a hard forced march could get him to  Sergoi on the night of the eighteenth.    It was arranged that he and Mr. Akeley, with Kermit and Tarlton and one  tent should start early the next morning on the hunt, trusting to luck  in overtaking the herd that he had seen in the morning. The hunt was  enormously successful, and the adventures they had were so interesting  that they deserve a separate chapter.          CHAPTER IX    THE COLONEL READS MACAULAY'S \"ESSAYS,\" DISCOURSES ON MANY SUBJECTS WITH  GREAT FRANKNESS, DECLINES A DRINK OF SCOTCH WHISKY, AND KILLS THREE  ELEPHANTS      On the afternoon of November fourteenth, a little cavalcade of horsemen  might have been seen riding slowly away from our camp on the Nzoia  River. One of them, evidently the leader, was a well-built man of about  fifty-one years, tanned by many months of African hunting and wearing a  pair of large spectacles. His teeth flashed in the warm sunlight. A  rough hunting shirt encased his well-knit body and a pair of rougher  trousers, reinforced with leather knee caps and jointly sustained by  suspenders and a belt, fitted in loose folds around his stocky legs. On  his head was a big sun helmet, and around his waist, less generous in  amplitude than formerly, was a partly filled belt of Winchester  cartridges. His horse was a stout little Abyssinian shooting pony, gray  of color and lean in build, and in the blood-stained saddle-bag was a  well-worn copy of Macaulay's _Essays_, bound in pigskin. Our hero--for  it was he--was none other than Bwana Tumbo, the hunter-naturalist,  exponent of the strenuous life, and ex-president of the United States.    [Drawing: _Improving Each Shining Hour_]    If I were writing a thrilling story of adventure that is the way this  story would begin. But as this is designed to be a simple chronicle of  events, it is just as well at once to get down to basic facts and tell  about the Roosevelt elephant hunt, the hyena episode, and the pigskin  library, together with other more or less extraneous matter.    [Photograph: A Flag Flew Over the Colonel's Tent]    [Photograph: Kermit and Mr. Stephenson Diagnosing the Case]    Colonel Roosevelt, his son Kermit, Leslie Tarlton, who is managing the  Roosevelt expedition, and Edmund Heller, the taxidermist of the  expedition, came to our camp on the fourteenth of November to have  luncheon and to talk over plans whereby Colonel Roosevelt was to kill  one or more elephants for Mr. Akeley's American museum group of five or  six elephants. The details were all arranged and later in the afternoon  the colonel and his party left for their own camp, only a short distance  from ours.    Mr. Akeley, with one of our tents and about forty porters, followed  later in the evening and spent the night at the Roosevelt camp. The  following morning Colonel Roosevelt, Mr. Akeley, Mr. Tarlton and Kermit,  with two tents and forty porters and gunbearers, started early in the  hope of again finding the trail of the small herd of elephants that had  been seen the day before. The trail was picked up after a short time and  the party of hunters expected that it would be a long and wearisome  pursuit, for it was evident that the elephants had become nervous and  were moving steadily along without stopping to feed. In such cases they  frequently travel forty or fifty miles before settling down to quiet  feeding again.    The country was hilly, deep with dry grass, and badly cut up with small  gullies and jagged out-croppings of rock on the low ridges. At all times  the ears of the hunting party were alert for any sound that would  indicate the proximity of the herd, but for several hours no trumpeting,  nor intestinal rumbling, nor crash of tusks against small trees were  heard. Finally, at about eleven o'clock, Tarlton, who, strangely enough,  is partly deaf, heard a sound that caused the hunting party to stop  short. He heard elephants. They were undoubtedly only a short distance  ahead, but as the wind was from their direction there was little  likelihood that they had heard the approach of the hunters. So Tarlton,  who has had much experience in elephant hunting, led the party off at a  right angle from the elephant trail and then, turning, paralleled the  trail a few hundred feet away. They had gone only a short distance when  it became evident that they had passed the herd, which was hidden by the  tall grass and the thickly-growing scrub trees that grew on all sides.    The wooded character of the country rendered it easy to stalk the  elephant herd, and with careful attention to the wind, the four hunters  and their gunbearers advanced under cover until the elephants could be  seen and studied. Each of the four hunters carried a large  double-barreled cordite rifle that fires a five-hundred-grain bullet,  backed up by nearly a hundred grains of cordite.    As was expected, the herd consisted solely of cows and calves. There  were eight cow elephants and two _totos_, or calves, a circumstance that  was particularly fortunate, as Colonel Roosevelt was expected to secure  one or two cows for the group, while some one else was to get the calf.    For some moments the hunting party studied the group of animals and  finally decided which ones were the best for the group.    Two of the largest cows and the calf of one of them were selected. It is  always the desire of collectors who kill groups of animals for museums  to kill the calf and the mother at the same time whenever practicable,  so that neither one is left to mourn the loss of the other. It is one of  the unpleasant features of group collecting that calves must be killed,  but the collector justifies himself in the thought that many thousands  of people will be instructed and interested in the group when it is  finished.    Elephant hunting is considered by many African hunters as being the most  dangerous of all hunting. When a man is wounded by an elephant he is  pretty likely to die, whereas the wounds inflicted by lions are often  not necessarily mortal ones. Also, in fighting a wounded lion one may  sometimes take refuge in the low branches of a tree, but with a wounded  elephant there is rarely time to climb high enough and quick enough to  escape the frenzied animal. In elephant shooting, also, the hunter  endeavors to approach within twenty or thirty yards, so that the bullets  may be placed exactly where their penetration will be the most  instantaneously deadly. Consequently, a badly placed bullet may merely  infuriate the elephant without giving the hunter time to gain a place of  safety, and thus be much worse than if the hunter had entirely missed  his mark.    Among elephant hunters it is considered more dangerous to attack a cow  elephant than a bull, for the cow is always ready and eager to defend  its calf, hence when Colonel Roosevelt prepared to open fire on a cow  elephant, accompanied by a calf, at a range of thirty yards, in a  district where the highest tree was within reach of an elephant's trunk,  the situation was one fraught with tense uncertainty.    Colonel Roosevelt is undoubtedly a brave man. The men who have hunted  with him in Africa say that he has never shown the slightest sign of  fear in all the months of big game hunting that they have done together.  He \"holds straight,\" as they say in shooting parlance, and at short  range, where his eyesight is most effective, he shoots accurately.    This, then, was the dramatic situation at about twelve o'clock noon on  November fifteenth, eight miles east of the Nzoia River, near Mount  Elgon: Eight cow elephants, two _totos_, one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#18)"],[1,"maddening,\" said Bristol, \"to know that Hassan and Company  are snugly located somewhere under our very noses, and that all  Scotland Yard can find no trace of them.  Then to think that Hassan  of Aleppo, apparently by means of some mystical light, has knowledge  of the whereabouts of the slipper and consequently of the  whereabouts of Earl Dexter (another badly wanted man) is extremely  discouraging!  I feel like an amateur; I'm ashamed of myself!\"    Bristol departed in a condition of irritable uncertainty.    My head in my hands, I sat for long after his departure, with the  phantom characters of the ghoulish drama dancing through my  brain.  The distorted yellow dwarfs seemed to gibe apish before me.  Severed hands clenched and unclenched themselves in my face, and  gleaming knives flashed across the mental picture.  Predominant over  all was the stately figure of Hassan of Aleppo, that benignant,  remorseless being, that terrible guardian of the holy relic who  directed the murderous operations.  Earl Dexter, The Stetson Man,  with his tightly bandaged arm, his gaunt, clean-shaven face and  daredevil smile, figured, too, in my feverish daydream; nor was  that other character missing, the girl with the violet eyes whose  beautiful presence I had come to dread; for like a sybil announcing  destruction her appearances in the drama had almost invariably  presaged fresh tragedies.  I recalled my previous meetings with  this woman of mystery.  I recalled my many surmises regarding her  real identity and association with the case.  I wondered why in the  not very distant past I had promised to keep silent respecting her;  I wondered why up to that present moment, knowing beyond doubt that  her activities were inimical to my interests, were criminal, I had  observed that foolish pledge.    And now my door-bell was ringing--as intuitively I had anticipated.  So certain was I of the identity of my visitor that as I walked  along the passage I was endeavouring to make up my mind how I should  act, how I should receive her.    I opened the door; and there, wearing European garments but a green  turban ... stood Hassan of Aleppo!    When I say that amazement robbed me of the power to speak, to move,  almost to think, I doubt not you will credit me.  Indeed, I felt  that modern London was crumbling about me and that I was become  involved in the fantastic mazes of one of those Oriental intrigues  such as figure in the Romance of Abu Zeyd, or with which most  European readers have been rendered familiar by the glowing pages  of \"The Thousand and One Nights.\"    \"Effendim,\" said my visitor, \"do not hesitate to act as I direct!\"    In his gloved hand he carried what appeared to be an ebony cane.  He raised and pointed it directly at me.  I perceived that it was,  in fact, a hollow tube.    \"Death is in my hand,\" he continued; \"enter slowly and I will  follow you.\"    Still the sense of unreality held me thralled and my brain refused  me service.  Like an hypnotic subject I walked back to my study,  followed by my terrible visitor, who reclosed the door behind him.    He sat facing me across my littered table with the mysterious tube  held loosely in his grasp.    How infinitely more terrifying are perils unknown than those known  and appreciated!  Had a European armed with a pistol attempted a  similar act of coercion, I cannot doubt that I should have put up  some sort of fight; had he sat before me now as Hassan of Aleppo  sat, with a comprehensible weapon thus laid upon his knees, I  should have taken my chance, should have attacked him with the lamp,  with a chair, with anything that came to my hand.    But before this awful, mysterious being who was turning my life  into channels unsuspected, before that black tube with its unknown  potentialities, I sat in a kind of passive panic which I cannot  attempt to describe, which I had never experienced before and have  never known since.    \"There is one about to visit you,\" he said, \"whom you know, whom I  think you expect.  For it is written that she shall come and such  events cast a shadow before them.  I, too, shall be present at your  meeting!\"    His eagle eyes opened widely; they burned with fanaticism.    \"Already she is here!\" he resumed suddenly, and bent as one  listening.  \"She comes under the archway; she crossed the  courtyard--and is upon the stair!  Admit her, effendim; I shall be close  behind you!\"    The door-bell rang.    With the consciousness that the black tube was directed toward the  back of my head, I went and opened the door.  My mind was at work  again, and busy with plans to terminate this impossible situation.    On the landing stood a girl wearing a simple white frock which  fitted her graceful figure perfectly.  A white straw hat, of the New  York tourist type, with a long veil draped from the back suited her  delicate beauty very well.  The red mouth drooped a little at the  corners, but the big violet eyes, like lamps of the soul, seemed  afire with mystic light.    \"Mr. Cavanagh,\" she said, very calmly and deliberately, \"there is  only one way now to end all this trouble.  I come from the man who  can return the slipper to where it belongs; but he wants his price!\"    Her quiet speech served completely to restore my mental balance, and  I noted with admiration that her words were so chosen as to commit  her in no way.  She knew quite well that thus far she might appear  in the matter with impunity, and she clearly was determined to say  nothing that could imperil her.    \"Will you please come in?\" I said quietly--and stood aside to  admit her.    Exhibiting wonderful composure, she entered--and there, in the  badly lighted hallway came face to face with my other visitor!    It was a situation so dramatic as to seem unreal.    Away from that tall figure retreated the girl with the violet  eyes--and away--until she stood with her back to the wall.  Even in  the gloom I could see that her composure was deserting her; her  beautiful face was pallid.    \"Oh, God!\" she whispered, all but inaudible--\"You!\"    Hassan, grasping the black rod in his hand, signed to her to enter  the study.  She stood quite near to me, with her eyes fixed upon  him.  I bent closer to her.    \"My revolver--in left-hand table drawer,\" I breathed in her ear.  \"Get it.  He is watching me!\"    I could not tell if my words had been understood, for, never taking  her gaze from the Sheikh of the Assassins, she sidled into the study.  I followed her; and Hassan came last of all.  Just within the  doorway he stood, confronting us.    \"You have come,\" he said, addressing the girl and speaking in  perfect English but with a marked accent, \"to open your impudent  negotiations through Mr. Cavanagh for the return of the thrice holy  relic to the Museum!  Your companion, the man, who is inspired by  the Evil One, has even dared to demand ransom for the slipper from  me!\"    Hassan was majestic in his wrath; but his eyes were black with  venomous hatred.    \"He has suffered the penalty which the Koran lays down; he has lost  his right hand.  But the lord of all evil protects him, else ere  this he had lost his life!  Move no closer to that table!\"    I started.  Either Hassan of Aleppo was omniscient or he had  overheard my whispered words!    \"Easily I could slay you where you stand!\" he continued.  \"But to  do so would profit me nothing.  This meeting has been revealed to  me.  Last night I witnessed it as I slept.  Also it has been  revealed to me by Erroohanee, in the mirror of ink, that the slipper  of the Prophet, Salla-'llahu 'ale yhi wasellem!  Shall indeed return  to that place accursed, that infidel eyes may look upon it!  It is  the will of Allah, whose name be exalted, that I hold my hand, but  it is also His will that I be here, at whatever danger to my  worthless body.\"    He turned his blazing eyes upon me.    \"To-morrow, ere noon,\" he said, \"the slipper will again be in the  Museum from which the man of evil stole it.  So it is written;  obscure are the ways.  We met last night, you and I, but at that  time much was dark to me that now is light.  The holy 'Alee spoke  to me in a vision, saying: 'There are two keys to the case in which  it will be locked.  Secure one, leaving the other with him who  holds it!  Let him swear to be secret.  This shall be the price of  his life!'\"    The black tube was pointed directly at my forehead.    \"Effendim,\" concluded the speaker, \"place in my hand the key of the  case in the Antiquarian Museum!\"    Hands convulsively clenched, the girl was looking from me to Hassan.  My throat felt parched, but I forced speech to my lips.    \"Your omniscience fails you,\" I said.  \"Both keys are at my bank!\"    Blacker grew the fierce eyes--and blacker.  I gave myself up for  lost; I awaited death--death by some awful, unique means--with  what courage I could muster.    From the court below came the sound of voices, the voices of  passers-by who so little suspected what was happening near to them  that had someone told them they certainly had refused to credit it.  The noise of busy Fleet Street came drumming under the archway, too.    Then, above all, another sound became audible.  To this day I find  myself unable to define it; but it resembled the note of a silver  bell.    Clearly it was a signal; for, hearing it, Hassan dropped the tube  and glanced toward the open window.    In that instant I sprang upon him!    That I had to deal with a fanatic, a dangerous madman, I knew; that  it was his life or mine, I was fully convinced.  I struck out then  and caught him fairly over the heart.  He reeled back, and I made  a wild clutch for the damnable tube, horrid, unreasoning fear of  which thus far had held me inert.    I heard the girl scream affrightedly, and I knew, and felt my heart  chill to know, that the tube had been wrenched from my hand!  Hassan  of Aleppo, old man that he appeared, had the strength of a tiger.  He  recovered"]]]
