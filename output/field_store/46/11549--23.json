Pichegru and the other royalists of  note in the assemblies, to the number of more than 150, were arrested  and sent into exile. The government, for the moment, recovered the  semblance of security; and Buonaparte heard, with little satisfaction,  that they had been able to accomplish their immediate object without the  intervention of his personal appearance on the scene. He remonstrated,  moreover, against the manner in which they had followed up their  success. According to him, they ought to have executed Pichegru and a  few ring-leaders, and set an example of moderation, by sparing all those  whose royalism admitted of any doubt, or, if it was manifest, was of  secondary importance. It would have been hard for the Directory at this  time to have pleased Buonaparte, or for Buonaparte to have entirely  satisfied them; but neither party made the effort.    The fall of Venice, however, gave Napoleon the means, which he was not  disposed to neglect, of bringing his treaty with Austria to a more  satisfactory conclusion than had been indicated in the preliminaries of  Leoben.    After settling the affairs of Venice, and establishing the new Ligurian  Republic, the general took up his residence at the noble castle of  Montebello, near Milan. Here his wife, who, though they had been married  in March, 1796, was still a bride, and with whom, during the intervening  eventful months, he had kept up a correspondence full of the fervour, if  not of the delicacy of love,[20] had at length rejoined him. Josephine's  manners were worthy, by universal admission, of the highest rank; and  the elegance with which she did the honours of the castle, filled the  ministers and princes, who were continually to be seen in its precincts,  with admiration. While Napoleon conducted his negotiations with as much  firmness and decision as had marked him in the field, it was her care  that nature and art should lend all their graces to what the Italians  soon learnt to call _the Court_ of Montebello. Whatever talent Milan  contained, was pressed into her service. Music and dance, and festival  upon festival, seemed to occupy every hour. The beautiful lakes of  Lombardy were covered with gay flotillas; and the voluptuous retreats  around their shores received in succession new life and splendour from  the presence of Napoleon, Josephine, and the brilliant circle amidst  whom they were rehearsing the imperial parts that destiny had in reserve  for them. Montebello was the centre from which Buonaparte, during the  greater part of this autumn, negotiated with the emperor, controlled all  Italy, and overawed the Luxembourg.    The final settlement with the emperor's commissioners would have taken  place shortly after the fall of Venice, but for the successful intrigues  of the royalist Clichyens, the universal belief that the government of  France approached some new crisis, and the Austrians' hope that from  such an event their negotiation might derive considerable advantages.  Buonaparte well knew the secret motive which induced Cobentzel, the  emperor's chief envoy, to protract and multiply discussions of which he  by this time was weary. One day, in this ambassador's own chamber,  Napoleon suddenly changed his demeanour; \"you refuse to accept our  ultimatum,\" said he, taking in his hands a beautiful vase of porcelain,  which stood on the mantelpiece near him. The Austrian bowed. \"It is  well,\" said Napoleon, \"but mark me--within two months I will shatter  Austria like this potsherd.\" So saying, he dashed the vase on the ground  in a thousand pieces, and moved towards the door. Cobentzel followed  him, and made submissions which induced him once more to resume his  negotiations.    The result was the treaty of Campo-Formio, so-called from the village at  which it was signed, on the 3d of October, 1797. By this act the emperor  yielded to France, Flanders and the boundary of the Rhine, including the  great fortress of Mentz. The various new republics of Lombardy were  united and recognised under the general name of the Cisalpine Republic.  To indemnify Austria for the loss of those territories, the fall of  Venice afforded new means--of which Napoleon did not hesitate to  propose, nor Austria to accept the use. The French general had indeed  conquered Venice, but he had entered into a treaty subsequently, and  recognised a wholly new government in place of the oligarchy. The  emperor, on the other hand, well knew that the Doge and Senate had  incurred ruin by rising to his own aid. Such considerations weighed  little on either side. France and Austria agreed to effect a division of  the whole territories of the ancient republic. Venice herself, and her  Italian provinces, were handed over to the emperor in lieu of his lost  Lombardy; and the French assumed the sovereignty of the Ionian islands  and Dalmatia. This unprincipled proceeding excited universal disgust  throughout Europe. It showed the sincerity of Buonaparte's love for the  cause of freedom; and it satisfied all the world of the excellent title  of the imperial court to complain of the selfishness and rapacity of the  French democracy.    The emperor set his seal at Campo-Formio to another of Buonaparte's acts  of dictatorship, which, though in one point of view even more  unjustifiable than this, was not regarded by the world with feelings of  the same order. The Italian territory of the Valteline had for ages been  subject to the Grison League. The inhabitants, roused by the prevailing  spirit all around them, demanded Napoleon's intercession with their  Swiss masters, to procure their admission to all the political  privileges of the other cantons. They refused; and Napoleon, in the  plenitude of his authority, immediately supported the Valteline in  throwing off the Grison yoke, and asserting its utter independence. This  territory was now annexed to the Cisalpine Republic. A government, with  which France was on terms of alliance and amity, was thus robbed of its  richest possession; but the Valteline belonged by natural position,  religion, and language, to Italy, and its annexation to the new Italian  republic was regarded as in itself just and proper, however questionable  Buonaparte's title to effect that event. He himself said at the time,  \"It is contrary to the rights of man that any one people should be  subject to another;\" a canon on which his after history formed a lucid  commentary.    In concluding, and in celebrating the conclusion of his treaty,  Napoleon's proud and fiery temperament twice shone out. Cobentzel had  set down as the first article, \"The Emperor recognises the French  Republic.\" \"Efface that,\" said Napoleon, sternly, \"it is as clear as  that the sun is in heaven. Woe to them that cannot distinguish the light  of either!\" At the TE DEUM after the proclamation of the peace,  the imperial envoy would have taken the place prepared for Buonaparte,  which was the most eminent in the church. The haughty soldier seized his  arm and drew him back. \"Had your master himself been here,\" said he, \"I  should not have forgotten that in my person the dignity of France is  represented.\"    Various minor arrangements remained to be considered; and a congress of  all the German powers being summoned to meet for that purpose at  Rastadt, Napoleon received the orders of the Directory to appear there,  and perfect his work in the character of ambassador of France. He took  an affecting leave of his soldiery, published a temperate and manly  address to the Cisalpine Republic, and proceeded, by way of Switzerland,  (where, in spite of the affair of the Valteline, he was received with  enthusiasm,) to the execution of his duty. He carried with him the  unbounded love and devotion of one of the finest armies that ever the  world had seen; and the attachment, hardly less energetic, of all those  classes of society throughout Italy, who flattered themselves with the  hope that the Cisalpine Republic, the creature of his hands, would in  time prepare the way for, and ultimately merge in a republican  constitution common to the whole Italian people. With what hopes or  fears as to his future fortunes he abandoned the scene and the  companions of his glory, the reader must form his own opinion.    [Footnote 18: Moreau knew it some months sooner, and said so _after_  Napoleon had communicated it to the Directory. This is a suspicious  circumstance when considered along with the sequel of Moreau's history.]    [Footnote 19: Mantua, as will appear hereafter, was saved to France  under Napoleon's final treaty with Austria; but the events which  rendered this possible were as yet unknown and unexpected.]    [Footnote 20: It would be painful to show, as might easily be done, from  this correspondence, the original want of delicacy in Napoleon's mind.  Many of his letters are such as no English gentleman would address to a  _mistress_.

Napoleon was received by the ministers assembled at Rastadt with the  respect due to the extraordinary talents which he had already displayed  in negotiation as well as in war. But he stayed among them only two or  three days, for he perceived that the multiplicity of minor arrangements  to be discussed and settled, must, if he seriously entered upon them,  involve the necessity of a long-protracted residence at Rastadt; and he  had many reasons for desiring to be quickly in Paris. His personal  relations with the Directory were of a very doubtful kind, and he  earnestly wished to study with his own eyes the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#18)"],[1,"distant, but as we neared Radzivilow the  guns were crashing away as they did at Lodz, and we prepared for a hot  time. The station had been entirely wrecked and was simply in ruins, but  the station-master's house near by was still intact, and we had orders  to rig up a temporary dressing-station there.    Before we had time to unpack our dressings, a messenger arrived to tell  us that the Germans had succeeded in enfilading a Russian trench close  by, and that they were bringing fifty very badly wounded men to us  almost at once. We had just time to start the sterilizer when the little  carts began to arrive with some terribly wounded men. The machine guns  had simply swept the trench from end to end. The worst of it was that  some lived for hours when death would have been a more merciful release.  Thank God we had plenty of morphia with us and could thus ease their  terrible sufferings. One man had practically his whole face blown off,  another had all his clothes and the flesh of his back all torn away.  Another poor old fellow was brought in with nine wounds in the abdomen.  He looked quite a patriarch with a long flowing beard--quite the oldest  man I have seen in the Russian army. Poor Ivan, he had only just been  called up to the front and this was his first battle. He was beautifully  dressed, and so clean; his wife had prepared everything for him with  such loving care, a warm knitted vest, and a white linen shirt most  beautifully embroidered with scarlet in a intricate key-pattern. Ivan  was almost more unhappy at his wife's beautiful work having to be cut  than at his own terrible wounds. He was quite conscious and not in much  pain, and did so long to live even a week or two longer, so that he  might see his wife once again. But it was not to be, and he died early  the next morning--one of the dearest old men one could ever meet, and so  pathetically grateful for the very little we could do for him.    The shells were crashing over our heads and bursting everywhere, but we  were too busy to heed them, as more and more men were brought to the  dressing-station. It was an awful problem what to do with them: the  house was small and we were using the two biggest rooms downstairs as  operating- and dressing-rooms. Straw was procured and laid on the floors  of all the little rooms upstairs, and after each man's wounds were  dressed he was carried with difficulty up the narrow winding staircase  and laid on the floor.    The day wore on and as it got dark we began to do the work under great  difficulties, for there were no shutters or blinds to the upstairs  windows, and we dared not have any light--even a candle--there, as it  would have brought down the German fire on us at once. So those poor men  had to lie up there in the pitch dark, and one of us went round from  time to time with a little electric torch. Downstairs we managed to  darken the windows, but the dressings and operations had all to be done  by candle-light.    The Germans were constantly sending up rockets of blue fire which  illuminated the whole place, and we were afraid every moment they would  find us out. Some of the shells had set houses near by on fire too, and  the sky was lighted up with a dull red glow. The carts bringing the men  showed no lights, and they were lifted out in the dark when they arrived  and laid in rows in the lobby till we had time to see to them. By nine  o'clock that evening we had more than 300 men, and were thankful to see  an ambulance train coming up the line to take them away. The sanitars  had a difficult job getting these poor men downstairs and carrying them  to the train, which was quite dark too. But the men were thankful  themselves to get away, I think--it was nerve-racking work for them,  lying wounded in that little house with the shells bursting continually  over it.    All night long the men were being brought in from the trenches. About  four in the morning there was a little lull and some one made tea. I  wonder what people in England would have thought if they had seen us at  that meal. We had it in the stuffy dressing-room where we had been  working without a stop for sixteen hours with tightly closed windows,  and every smell that can be imagined pervading it, the floor covered  with mud, blood and debris of dressings wherever there were not  stretchers on which were men who had just been operated on. The meal of  milkless tea, black bread, and cheese, was spread on a sterilized towel  on the operating-table, illuminated by two candles stuck in bottles.  Princess sat in the only chair, and the rest of us eased our weary feet  by sitting on the edge of the dressing-boxes. Two dead soldiers lay at  our feet--it was not safe just at that moment to take them out and bury  them. People would probably ask how we _could_ eat under those  conditions. I don't know how we could either, but we _did_ and were  thankful for it--for immediately after another rush began.    At eleven o'clock in the morning another ambulance train arrived and was  quickly filled. By that time we had had more than 750 patients through  our hands, and they were still being brought in large numbers. The  fighting must have been terrific, for the men were absolutely worn out  when they arrived, and fell asleep at once from exhaustion, in spite of  their wounds. Some of them must have been a long time in the trenches,  for many were in a terribly verminous condition. On one poor boy with a  smashed leg the insects could have only been counted by the million.  About ten minutes after his dressing was done, his white bandage was  quite grey with the army of invaders that had collected on it from his  other garments.    Early that afternoon we got a message that another Column was coming to  relieve us, and that we were to return to Zyradow for a rest. We were  very sorry to leave our little dressing-station, but rejoiced to hear  that we were to go up again in two days' time to relieve this second  Column, and that we were to work alternately with them, forty-eight  hours on, and then forty-eight hours off duty.    We had left Zyradow rather quiet, but when we came back we found the  cannon going hard, both from the Radzivilow and the Goosof direction. It  would have taken much more than cannon to keep _us_ awake, however, and  we lay down most gratefully on our stretchers in the empty room at the  Red Cross Bureau and slept. A forty-eight hours' spell is rather long  for the staff, though probably there would have been great difficulty in  changing the Columns more often.    I woke up in the evening to hear the church bells ringing, and  remembered that it was Christmas Eve and that they were ringing for the  Midnight Mass, so I got up quickly. The large church was packed with  people, every one of the little side chapels was full and people were  even sitting on the altar steps. There must have been three or four  thousand people there, most of them of course the people of the place,  but also soldiers, Red Cross workers and many refugees mostly from  Lowice. Poor people, it was a sad Christmas for them--having lost so  much already and not knowing from day to day if they would lose all, as  at that time it was a question whether or not the Russian authorities  would decide for strategic reasons to fall back once more.    And then twelve o'clock struck and the Mass began.    Soon a young priest got up into the pulpit and gave them a little  sermon. It was in Polish, but though I could not understand the words, I  could tell from the people's faces what it was about. When he spoke of  the horrors of war, the losses and the deaths and the suffering that had  come to so many of them, one woman put her apron to her face and sobbed  aloud in the tense silence. And in a moment the whole congregation began  sobbing and moaning and swaying themselves to and fro. The young priest  stopped and left them alone a moment or two, and then began to speak in  a low persuasive voice. I do not know what he said, but he gradually  soothed them and made them happy. And then the organ began pealing out  triumphantly, and while the guns crashed and thundered outside, the  choir within sang of peace and goodwill to all men.    Christmas Day was a very mournful one for us, as we heard of the loss of  our new and best automobile, which had just been given as a present to  the Column. One of the boys was taking it to Warsaw from Skiernevice  with some wounded officers, and it had broken down just outside the  village. The mud was awful, and with the very greatest difficulty they  managed to get it towed as far as Rawa, but had to finally abandon it to  the Germans, though fortunately they got off safely themselves. It was a  great blow to the Column, as it was impossible to replace it, these big  ambulance cars costing something like 8000 roubles.    So our Christmas dinner eaten at our usual dirty little restaurant could  not be called a success.    Food was very scarce at that time in Zyradow; there was hardly any meat  or sugar, and no milk or eggs or white bread. One of us had brought a  cake for Christmas from Warsaw weeks before, and it was partaken of on  this melancholy occasion without enthusiasm. Even the punch made out of  a teaspoonful of brandy from the bottom of Princess's flask mixed with  about a pint of water and two lumps of sugar failed to move us to any  hilarity. Our menu did not vary in any particular from that usually  provided at the restaurant, though we did feel we might have had a clean  cloth for once.    MENU    CHRISTMAS 1914    Gravy Soup.    Roast Horse. Boiled Potatoes.    Currant Cake.    Tea. Punch.    We were very glad to go up to Radzivilow once more. Our former  dressing-station had been abandoned as too dangerous for staff and  patients, and the dressing- and operating-room was now in a train about  five versts down the line from Radzivilow station. Our train was a  permanency on the line, and we"]]]
