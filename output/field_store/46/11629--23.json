In  the rondos, then, all the movements of musical development revolve  about one significant sentence or theme, the style of which therefore  determines the prevailing character of the whole composition.  This,  which is naturally called the Principal theme, is placed at the  beginning of the rondo.  Its end being reached, it is temporarily  abandoned for a second sentence, called the Subordinate theme, of more  or less emphatically contrasting style and of nearly or quite equal  length (generally shorter, however), and always in a different key.  After this there occurs the momentous _return to the beginning_,--the  most insistent and vital fundamental condition of good, clear, musical  form, of whatsoever dimension or purport,--and the _Principal_ theme  reasserts itself, recurring with a certain degree of variation and  elaboration (occasionally abbreviation), thus vindicating its title as  Principal theme, and stamping its fellow-theme as a mere digression.  After this,--if a still broader design is desired,--another digression  may be made into a new Subordinate theme, in still another key,  followed by the persistent return to the Principal theme.  And so on.  Upon the Subordinate theme, or themes, devolves the burden of variety  and contrast, while the Principal theme fulfils the requirements of  corroboration and concentration.  A coda, sometimes of considerable  length, is usually added; it appears to be necessary, as a means of  supplying an instinctive demand for balance, increased interest, and  certain other scarcely definable conditions of very real importance in  satisfactory music form.    Of the Rondo-forms there are three grades, distinguished respectively  _by the number of digressions_ from the Principal theme:--    The First Rondo-form, with one digression (or Subordinate theme), and  one return to the Principal theme;    The Second Rondo-form, with two digressions, and two returns;    The Third Rondo-form, with three digressions and three returns.  The  persistent recurrence of the Principal theme, something like a refrain,  and the consequent regular alternation of the chief sentence with its  contrasting subordinate sentences, are the distinctive structural  features of the Rondo.    {108}    THE FIRST RONDO-FORM.--This consists, then, of a Principal theme  (generally Two-Part or Three-Part Song-form); a Subordinate theme in a  different key (probably a smaller form); a recurrence of the Principal  theme (usually more or less modified or elaborated); and a coda.  Thus:--     _Principal Theme.   Subordinate Theme.       Prin. Theme.    Coda._   2- or 3-Part        Period, Double-period,   As before,      Optional   Song-form.          2- or 3-Part             usually   Probably a          form.  Different         variated.   perfect cadence.    style and key.           Sometimes   Possibly a few      Possibly a brief         abbreviated.   beats or measures   codetta; and   of transitional     usually a few   material, leading   measures of   into next theme.    Re-transition.    The design is that of the tripartite forms.  But it is not to be  confounded with the Three-Part _Song-form_, because at least one of its  Themes, and probably both, will be a Part-form by itself.  It is an  association of Song-forms, and therefore corresponds in design to the  _Song with Trio_.  The first Rondo differs from the latter, however, in  being more compact, more coherent and continuous, and more highly  developed.  This manifests itself in the relation of the Themes to each  other, which, despite external contrast, is more intimate than that  between the Principal and Subordinate Song (or Trio); further, in the  transitional passages from one Theme into the other (especially the  Re-transition, or \"returning passage\"); in the customary elaboration of  the recurring Principal Theme; and in the almost indispensable coda,  which often assumes considerable importance, and an elaborate form and  character.    The evolution of the First Rondo-form of the Song with Trio may be  clearly traced in classic literature.  Many intermediate stages appear,  naturally; and it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the  design is Rondo or compound Song-form, simply because it is scarcely  possible to decide just when the \"Trio\" assumes the more intimate  relation of a Subordinate theme, or when the freedom and comparative  looseness of association (peculiar to the Song with Trio) is  transformed into the closer cohesion and greater smoothness of finish  _which fuses all the component Parts of the design into one compact  whole_,--the distinctive stamp of all so-called \"higher\" forms.    The thoughtful examination and comparison of the following four  examples will elucidate the matter:--    1. Beethoven, first pianoforte sonata (op. 2, No. 1), _Menuetto_ and  _Trio_.  Already analyzed as a perfectly genuine Song with Trio.    2. Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 28, second movement, _Andante_.  The principal Song is in the Three-Part form, with exact repetitions.  The subordinate song differs so radically in style, and each song is so  complete and distinct from the other, that the form is almost certainly  Song with Trio; but there is a strong intimation of the Rondo-form in  the elaborate variation of the _da capo_, and in the treatment of the  coda (last 17 measures), in which motives from both Songs are  associated so closely as to vindicate their kinship.  In a word, this  movement possesses,--despite the apparent independence of its  Songs,--some degree of that continuity, compactness and artistic finish  which culminate in the genuine Rondo-form.    3. Mozart, pianoforte sonata, No. 10, second movement (_Rondeau en  polonaise_).  The continuity and unity of this composition is so  complete that it is certainly a Rondo-form; the principal theme is a  fairly large Three-Part form; the subordinate theme (measure 47-69) is  a Two-Part form, the second part corresponding in contents to the  second Part of the principal theme; the _recurrence_ of the principal  theme is abbreviated to one of its three Parts, and is merged in the  coda (last seven measures), which assumes the nature of a mere  extension.  Despite all this evidence, there still remains a certain  impression of structural independence, which, so to speak, betrays the  \"seams,\" and militates somewhat against the spirit of the perfect  Rondo-form.  See also, No. 13, Adagio.    4. Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 2, No. 2, _Largo_; the unessential  details omitted in the following (in order to economize space) appear,  of course, in the original,--to which the student is expected to refer.    [Illustration: Example 54.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    [Illustration: Example 54 continued.]    [Illustration: Example 54 continued.]      This is a genuine First Rondo-form.  All the factors of which it is  composed, Phrases, Parts and Themes, are so closely interlinked that  the continuity, cohesion and _unity_ of the whole is complete.  The  variety of contents which these factors exhibit (greatest, naturally,  between the two themes), does not disturb the impression that the whole  movement is a unit.  This is due, at least partly, to the manner in  which the perfect cadences are disguised; each one is passed over with  the least possible check of rhythmic movement (measures 8, 19, etc.),  thus snugly dove-tailing the structural factors.  The coda is elaborate  and unusually long; it consists of several \"sections,\" as follows (see  the original): from measure 1 (the last measure in Ex. 54) to measure  4, a phrase, derived from the second Part of the Principal theme;  measures 5-7, an abbreviated repetition; measures 8-14, a phrase,  derived from the Principal theme; measures 15-17, a transitional  passage; measures 18-25, a period, closely resembling Part I of the  Principal theme; measures 26-30, final phrase.      LESSON 13.--Analyze the following examples.  They are not classified;  the student must determine whether the form is pure First Rondo, or an  intermediate grade between Rondo and \"Song with Trio.\"  One of the  examples is a genuine Song with Trio; and one is a _Three-Part  Song-form_; with reasonable vigilance the student will detect these  \"catches.\"  To distinguish these three designs from each other,  recollect--    That the Three-Part Song-form consists of three _single Parts_, fairly  similar in character, fairly small in form, and severed either by a  firm cadence, or by unmistakable proof of new \"beginning;\"    That in the first Rondo-form, at least one of the themes (if not both)  contains _two_ (or three) Parts; and,    That in the Song with Trio, the two \"Songs\" are more independent of  each other, and more decisively separated, than are the \"themes\" of the  Rondo-form.    With reference to all uncertain cases, it must be remembered that _the  more doubtful a distinction is, the less important is its decision_.  These designs naturally merge one in another, and at times it is folly  to impose a definite analysis upon them.    The analysis should be as minute as possible, nevertheless.  The first  step is to define the extremities of the two themes.  This fixes the  coda (and the introduction, if present); the re-transition (returning  passage into the Principal theme); and the transition into the  Subordinate theme--if present.  The form of each theme must be defined  in detail, as in Ex. 54:--    Beethoven, pianoforte sonatas: op. 2, No. 1, _Adagio_.    Op. 7, _Largo_.    Op. 2, No. 3, _Adagio_.    Op. 79, _Andante_.    Op. 27, No. 1, _Allegro molto_.    Schubert, pianoforte _Impromptus_, op. 90, No. 2; and No. 3.    Chopin, _Mazurka_, No. 26.    Chopin, _Nocturnes_: op. 27, No. 1.    Op. 32, No. 2.

The  courier is charged with giving to the person invited explicit  information as to the day of the ceremony and the locality where it is  to be held. Sometimes these sticks have bands of color painted around  one end, usually green, sometimes red, though both colors may be  employed, the two ends being thus tinted. The person invited is obliged  to bring with him his invitation stick, and upon entering the  Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n he lays it upon the ground near the sacred stone, on  the side toward the degree post. In case a Mid[-e]/ is unable to attend  he sends his invitation with a statement of the reason of his inability  to come. The number of sticks upon the floor are counted, on the morning  of the day of initiation, and the number of those present to attend the  ceremonies is known before the initiation begins.    About five or six days preceding the day set for the ceremony of  initiation, the candidate removes to the neighborhood of the locality of  the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n. On the evening of the fifth day he repairs to the  sudatory or sweat-lodge, which has, in the meantime, been built east of  the sacred inclosure, and when seated within he is supplied with water  which he keeps for making vapor by pouring it upon heated stones  introduced for the purpose by assistants upon the outside. This act of  purification is absolutely necessary and must be performed once each day  for four days, though the process may be shortened by taking two vapor  baths in one day, thus limiting the process to two days. This, however,  is permitted, or desired only under extraordinary circumstances. During  the process of purgation, the candidates thoughts must dwell upon the  seriousness of the course he is pursuing and the sacred character of the  new life he is about to assume.    When the fumigation has ceased he is visited by the preceptor and the  other officiating Mid[-e]/ priests, when the conversation is confined  chiefly to the candidate's progress. He then gives to each of them  presents of tobacco, and after an offering to Ki/tshi Man/id[-o], with  the pipe, they expose the articles contained in their Mid[-e]/ sacks and  explain and expatiate upon the merits and properties of each of the  magic objects. The candidate for the first time learns of the manner of  preparing effigies, etc., with which to present to the incredulous  ocular demonstration of the genuineness and divine origin of the  Mid[-e]/wiwin, or, as it is in this connection termed, religion.    Several methods are employed for the purpose, and the greater the power  of the Mid[-e]/ the greater will appear the mystery connected with the  exhibition. This may be performed whenever circumstances demand such  proof, but the tests are made before the candidate with a twofold  purpose: first, to impress him with the supernatural powers of the  Mid[-e]/ themselves; and second, in an oracular manner, to ascertain if  Ki/tshi Ma/nid[-o] is pleased with the contemplated ceremony and the  initiation of the candidate.      [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    The first test is made by laying upon the floor of the wig/iwam a string  of four wooden beads each measuring about 1 inch in diameter. See Fig.  16. After the owner of this object has chanted for a few moments in an  almost inaudible manner the beads begin to roll from side to side as if  animated. The string is then quickly restored to its place in the  Mid[-e]/ sack. Another Mid[-e]/ produces a small wooden effigy of a man  (Fig. 17), measuring about 5 inches in height. The body has a small  orifice running through it from between the shoulders to the buttocks,  the head and neck forming a separate piece which may be attached to the  body like a glass stopper to a bottle.      [Illustration: Fig. 17.]      [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    A hole is made in the ground deep enough to reach to the hips of the  effigy, when the latter is put into it and the loose earth loosely  restored so as to hold it in an upright position. Some magic powder of  herbs is sprinkled around the body, and into the vertical orifice in it,  when the head is put in place. A series of inarticulate utterances are  chanted, when, if everything be favorable, the figure will perceptibly  move up and down as if possessed of life. Fig. 18 represents another  figure used in a similar manner. It consists of one piece, however, and  is decorated with narrow bands of dark blue flannel about the ankles and  knees, a patch of red cloth upon the breast and bands about the wrists,  each of the eyes being indicated by three white porcelain beads.    One of the most astonishing tests, however, and one that can be produced  only by Mid[-e]/ of the highest power, consists in causing a Mid[-e]/  sack to move upon the ground as if it were alive. This, it is  confidently alleged, has been done repeatedly, though it is evident that  the deception is more easily produced than in the above-mentioned  instances, as the temporary retention within a bag of a small mammal  could readily be made to account for the movements.    In most of these private exhibitions the light is so obscured as to  prevent the deception being observed and exposed; and when public  demonstrations of skill are made the auditors invariably consist of the  most credulous of the uninitiated, or the confreres of the performer,  from whom no antagonism or doubt would be expected.    The preceptor then consults with the Mid[-e]/ priests respecting the  presents to be delivered by the candidate, and repeats the following  words, viz:      Mis-shai/-[)e]-gwa  tshi-d[)e]-b[)o]g-in-de-mung/.    Now is the time     that we shall fix the price      gi/-she-g[)o]-dung/                   ka-mi/-n[)e]-n[)o]ngk    of everything pertaining to the sky,  that has been given to us      gi/-she-goy-d[)u]ng/  di/-bi-ga-d[-o]nk/ gai-y['e]/.    from the day [and]    the night also.

When the four vapor baths have been taken by the candidate, and the eve  of the ceremony has arrived, he remains in the sudatory longer than  usual so as not to come in contact with the large crowd of visitors who  have arrived upon the scene. The woods resound with the noises incident  to a large camp, while in various directions may be heard the monotonous  beating of the drum indicating the presence of a number of dancers,  or the hard, sharp taps of the mid[-e]/ drum, caused by a priest  propitiating and invoking the presence and favor of Ki/tshi Ma/nid[-o]  in the service now so near at hand.    When the night is far advanced and all becomes hushed, the candidate,  with only the preceptor accompanying, retires to his own wig/iwam, while  the assistant Mid[-e]/ priests and intimate friends or members of his  family collect the numerous presents and suspend them from the  transverse and longitudinal poles in the upper part of the  Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n. Watchers remain to see that nothing is removed during  the night.    At the approach of day, the candidate breakfasts and again returns to  the sweat-lodge to await the coming of his preceptor, and, later, of the  officiating priests. The candidate puts on"]]]
