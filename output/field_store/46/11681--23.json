Rigid as a marble statue stood the old knight. Like a bolt from  heaven the consciousness of his past ignoble conduct had flashed upon  him. Suddenly he seemed to feel how tenderly the loving arms of his  daughters had enfolded him. He spread out his hands towards them, as  if anxious to atone by the tenderness of a minute for the harshness of  years. Then the Emperor, deeply touched, thus addressed the old man.  \"Dear comrade-in-arms, your position is indeed enviable. The faithful  love of your daughters will tend you in your declining years. No  misguided son, impatient for your end, will hunt you from your home.  Alas, for me, to-morrow accompanied by a few faithful followers, I  must go down to battle against my own flesh and blood.\"    Towards midnight the unhappy monarch was conducted to a room prepared  with care for his reception; and, while he sank into a troubled sleep,  the old knight overwhelmed his daughters with long-delayed caresses.  In his heart, he silently entreated for pardon for the deep grudge he  had long cherished against the God who had been pleased to grant him  no son.           *       *       *       *       *    Three months had passed by. Sad news came to the Rhine from the  Netherlands. The Emperor Henry was dead. In the midst of fresh warlike  preparations death claimed him. His faithful partisans were therefore  greatly grieved and more especially Wolf of Hammerstein. But the  second part of the tidings made him even sadder. The consecrated earth  was denied to the unfortunate dead Emperor. His coffin was placed in a  cellar in Liege without any respect. Whoever wished could go there to  slander or to pray for the repose of his soul, whenever they desired.  When the knight was told of this he swore vehemently and did not close  his eyes for several nights. Then his mind was made up. All the  prayers and weeping of the daughters did not make him alter his  decision.    One day he stood before the Archbishop of Cologne and reminded him how  he had saved his life more than twenty years ago, and he recalled to  his memory that he had promised to grant any wish of the Hammersteins.    There was a great discussion between the knight and the bishop. But  the fidelity of the vassal was rewarded. The strong ecclesiastical  protection of the church at Cologne facilitated the steps to the  priests in Liege. Surrounded by pious women and earnest men he knelt,  a week later, before the sarcophagus, he pressed his lips to it and  murmured \"Henry my master and my King.\" Afterwards he had the body  transferred to Speyer where it was placed in the royal tomb.    When the mournful vessel went up the Rhine from Cologne, by order of  the knight black flags fluttered in the wind and greeted the dead  Emperor. Hammerstein was always known later on as the most faithful  vassal of the King.          VALLEY OF THE AHR    The Last Knight of Altenahr      Only a few mouldering ruins now show where one of the proudest  strongholds of the Rhine country, Castle Altenahr, once stood. A  legend relates the mournful story of the last of the race which had  lived there for centuries.    This man was a very stubborn knight, and he would not bow down to or  even acknowledge the all-powerful archbishop, whom His Majesty the  Emperor had sent into the Rhine country as protector of the church.    Unfortunately the bishop was also of a proud and unyielding character,  and he nursed resentment in his heart against this spurner of his  authority.    It was not long before his smouldering rancour blazed into an open  feud, and the mighty bishop, accompanied by a large band of followers,  appeared before the proud castle of Altenahr. A ring of iron was  formed round the offending vassal's hold.    But its owner was not disturbed by this formidable array, and only  laughed sneeringly at the besiegers' useless trouble, knowing well  that they would never be able to storm his rocky stronghold.    The warlike priest saw many of his little army bleeding to death in  vain. He was very wrathful, but nevertheless undismayed.    He had sworn a great oath that he would enter this invincible hold as  a conqueror, even if the fight were to last till the Judgment Day; the  lord of Altenahr had sworn a similar oath, and these two powerful foes  were well matched.    Thus the siege continued for some months. The besieger's anger grew  hotter, for every attack cost him the lives of numbers of his  followers, and all his efforts seemed useless.    Already there was an outburst of discontent in his camp; many servants  and vassals deserted from such a dangerous venture. Revolt and  disobedience seemed on one occasion to threaten a complete dissolution  of the besieging army, as a desperate attack had been again repulsed  by the hidden inhabitants of the fort.    The bishop's allies urged the unrelenting man to desist from his  merciless purpose, but he received their protests with a sneer: \"When  you leave me, my greater ally, hunger, will draw near. It will come,  that I am sure of.\" Then followed an uproar of confused voices;  mutinous troopers, now become bold by the wine they had taken, fell to  brawling with their leader. The bishop's grim smile died away.    \"Wait my men, just wait for one more attack,\" he cried in a powerful  voice, \"it will be the fiercest and the last,\" and with a dark face he  turned and strode away.           *       *       *       *       *    Dawn was creeping over the valley of the Ahr. There was a great stir  in the camp on the side of the mountain, and up above, in the castle  of Altenahr, silence reigned round hazy pinnacles. Suddenly a flourish  of trumpets was heard, and the drawbridge having been let down, the  lord of the castle galloped forth on a milkwhite charger, his tall  figure towering over the animal, the feather of his helmet waving  above his grey hair, and the first rays of the rising sun irradiating  his steel armour.    Holding his steed with a firm grip, he raised his right hand to the  shouting besiegers, signifying that he wished to speak. His voice  sounded far and wide.    \"See here the last man and the last charger of all those who lived in  my tower. Hunger has snatched them all from me, wife, child, comrades.  They all preferred death to slavery. I follow them, unvanquished and  free to the last.\"    The noble animal reared up at the spur of its rider ... a great  spring, followed by a thundering crash ... then the Ahr closed her  foaming waters over man and steed.    A shudder seized those who were looking on. The dark countenance of  their leader became pale as death, and he rode off without a moment's  delay, followed by the curses of his mutinous troops.    Since that time the castle of Altenahr has remained deserted; no one  dared to enter the chambers hallowed by the memory of this heroic  defence. Thus it was avoided by mankind, till time gnawed at its walls  and destroyed its battlements.          The Minstrel of Neuenahr      I.    He was called Ronald, this tall handsome man, with blue eyes and fair  hair; he had a noble bearing and was a master of song.    The knight at the Castle of Neuenahr had made a great feast, and  Ronald was sitting on the drawbridge playing his harp and singing. The  guests stopped their noisy conversation within doors and knights as  well as noble ladies listened breathless to the unseen singer. The  proud lord of the castle bade his page bring the traveller in. Thus  the tall handsome man, the blue eyed, fair-haired stranger with the  noble bearing, appeared before the high company. The knights looked at  him with wonder and many a handsome lady regarded him with admiration  covertly.    Among the high company there was a beautiful young girl, the daughter  of the knight, whose birthday was being celebrated. The lord of the  castle rose from his richly carved stool, and made a sign to the  singer who was bowing graciously to the knights and ladies and lower  still to the master of the castle.    \"Give us a song, musician, in honour of our child who is seventeen  years old to-day.\"    The musician fixed his glance in silent admiration on the maiden. She  dropped her eyes, and a lovely blush covered her cheeks. He seized his  harp, and after a few chords, began to sing a song of homage. Sweetly  sounded the music, and even sweeter the flattering words. The maiden  flushed a deeper crimson and cast down her eyes. Once when the harper  in his song compared her to a star lighting a wanderer's path, she  glanced up, and their eyes met; but hers sank quickly again. She  seemed to waken out of a dream when the song ended amid loud applause.  She saw her father lifting up a massive goblet and handing it to the  singer, saw how the latter raised it first to her, afterwards to her  father and his guests, and then put it to his own lips. The maiden  felt she was no longer mistress of her heart which was beating as it  had never done before.      II.    \"You might teach my Rothtraut to play the harp,\" cried the proud lord  of the castle, who was in a very lively humour, having partaken freely  of wine. She heard it as in a dream, and the musician bowed, murmuring  that he was not worthy to receive so signal an honour.    He remained however at the castle. Lovely Rothtraut felt afraid in her  heart like a trembling child crossing a bridge leading to flowery  meadows; she had no mother in whom she could confide those fears for  which she could find no words. She therefore yielded to her father's  desire, wishing to amuse him during the long, lonely evenings by  playing and singing. Singing came naturally to her, for a nightingale  seemed to slumber in her bosom, but she found more difficulty with the  harp. Her slender fingers drew many a discordant sound from the  strings, and often her father, comfortably seated in his armchair,  laughed heartily at her, which made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],[0,"Christmas: A Story (#18)"],[1," would they have to say to him? Yet what they should say  would, after all, matter nothing to him ... and perhaps he would hear  them say something about Bruce and Jenny. Still, he had nothing to take  there, as Abel had suggested. What had he that a boy would want to have?  Unless....    He thought for a moment. Then he crossed the street to what had been his  house. He went in, seeing again the hallway and stair, red-carpeted, and  the door opened into the lamplit room beyond. He found and lighted an  end of candle that he knew, and made his way up the stair. There he set  the candle down and lowered the ladder that led to the loft.    In the loft, a gust of wind from the skylight blew out the flame of his  little wick. In the darkness, the broken panes above his head looked  down on him like a face, and that face the sky, thousand-eyed. He  mounted a box, pushed up the frame, and put out his head. The sky lay  near. The little town showed, heaped roofs and lifting smoke, and here  and there a light. Sparkling in their midst was the light before the  Town Hall, like an eye guarding something and answering to the light  before his factory and to the other light before the station, where the  world went by. High over all, climbing the east, came Capella, and  seemed to be standing above the village.    As he looked, the need to express what he felt beset Ebenezer.    \"Quite a little town,\" he thought, \"quite a little town.\"    He closed the glass, and groped in the darkness to where the roof,  sloping sharply, met the door. There he touched an edge of something  that swayed, and he laid hold of and drew out that for which he had  come: Malcolm's hobbyhorse.    Downstairs in the hall he set it on the floor, examined it, rocked it  with one finger. The horse returned to its ancient office as if it were  irrevocably ordained to service. Ebenezer, his head on one side, stood  for some time regarding it. Then he slipped something in its worn  saddle-pocket. Last, he lifted and settled the thing under his arm.    \"I donno but I might as well walk around by Mary Chavah's house,\" he  thought. \"I needn't stay long....\"           *       *       *       *       *    At Mary Chavah's house the two big parlours, the hall, the stairs, the  dining room, even the tiny bedroom with the owl wall paper, were filled  with folk come to welcome the little boy. And on the parlour table, set  so that he should see it when first he entered, blazed Ellen Bourne's  little tree. The coffee was hot on the stove, good things were ready on  the table, and the air was electric with expectation, with the  excitement of being together, with the imminent surprise to Mary, and  with curiosity about the little stranger from Idaho.    \"What'll we all say when he first comes in?\" somebody asked.    \"Might say 'Merry Christmas,'\" two or three suggested.    \"Mercy, no!\" replied shocked voices, \"not to Mary Chavah, especially.\"    But however they should say it, the time was quick with cheer.    At quarter to eight the gate clicked. The word passed from one to  another, and by the time a step sounded on the porch the rooms were  still, save for the whispers, and a voice or two that kept unconsciously  on in some remote corner. But instead of the door opening to admit Mary  and her little boy, a hesitating knock sounded.    Those nearest to the door questioned one another with startled looks,  and one of them threw the door open. On the threshold stood Affer, the  telegraph operator, who thrust in a very dirty hand and a yellow  envelope.    \"We don't deliver nights,\" he said, \"but I thought she'd ought to have  this one. I'm going home to wash up, and then I'll be back,\" he added,  and left them staring at one another around the little lighted tree.          XIII      Before they could go out to find Mary, as a dozen would have done, she  was at the threshold, alone. She seemed to understand without wonder why  they were there, and with perfect naturalness she turned to them to  share her trouble.    \"He hasn't come,\" she said simply.    Her face was quite white, and because they usually saw her with a scarf  or shawl over her head, she looked almost strange to them, for she wore  a hat. Also she had on an unfamiliar soft-coloured wrap that had been  her mother's and was kept in tissues. She had dressed carefully to go to  meet the child. \"I might as well dress up a little,\" she had thought,  \"and I guess he'll like colours best.\"    Almost before she spoke they put in her hands the telegram. They were  pressing toward her, dreading, speechless, trying to hear what should be  read. She stepped nearer to the light of the candles on the little tree,  read, and reread in the stillness. When she looked up her face was so  illumined that she was strange to them once more.    \"Oh,\" she said, \"it's his train. It was late for the Local. They've put  him on the Express, and it'll drop him at the draw.\"    The tense air crumpled into breathings, and a soft clamour filled the  rooms as they told one another, and came to tell her how glad they were.  She pulled herself together and tried to slip into her natural manner.    \"It did give me a turn,\" she confessed; \"I thought he'd been--he'd  got....\"    She went into the dining room, still without great wonder that they were  all there; but when she saw the women in white aprons, and the table  arrayed, and on it Ellen Bourne's Christmas rose blooming, she broke  into a little laugh.    \"Oh,\" she said, \"you done this a-purpose for _him_.\"    \"I hope, Mary, you won't mind,\" Mis' Mortimer Bates said formally, \"it  being Christmas, so. We'd have done just the same on any other day.\"    \"Oh,\" Mary said, \"_mind_!\"    They hardly knew her, she moved among them so flushed and laughing and  conformable, praising, admiring, thanking them.    \"Honestly, Mary,\" said Mis' Moran, finally, \"we'll have you so you can't  tell Christmas from any other day--it'll be so nice!\"    The Express would be due at the \"draw\" at  eight-thirty--eight-thirty-three, Affer told her when he came back,  \"washed up.\" Mary watched the clock. She had not milked or fed the cows  before she went, because she had thought that _he_ would like to watch  the milking, and it would be something for him to do on that first  evening. So, when she could, she took her shawl and slipped out to the  shed for the pails and her lantern, and went alone to the stable.    Mary opened the door, and her lantern made a golden room of light within  the borderless shadow. The hay smell from the loft and the mangers, the  even breathing of the cows, the quiet safety of the place, met her. She  hung her lantern in its accustomed place, and went about her task.    Her mind turned back to the time that had elapsed since the Local came  in at the Old Trail Town station. She had stood there, with the children  about her, hardly breathing while the two Trail Town men and a solitary  traveling man had alighted. There had been no one else. In terror lest  the child should be carried past the station, she had questioned the  conductor, begged him to go in and look again, parleyed with him until  he had swung his lantern. Then she had turned away with the children,  utterly unable to formulate anything. There was no other train to stop  at Old Trail Town that night. It must mean disaster ... indefinable  disaster that had somehow engulfed him and had not pointed the way that  he had gone. She recalled, now, that she had refused Buff Miles's  invitation to ride, but had suffered him to take the children. Then she  had set out to walk home.    On that walk home she had unlived her plans. Obscure speculations,  stirring in her fear, at first tormented her, and then gave place to the  conclusion that John had changed his mind, had seen perhaps that he  could not after all let the child go so far, had found some one else to  take him; and that the morrow would bring a letter to tell her so. In  any case, she was not to have him. The conclusion swept her with the  vigour of certainty. But instead of the relief for which she would have  looked, that certainty gave her nothing but desolation. Until the moment  when the expectation seemed to die she had not divined how it had grown  into her days, as subtly as the growth of little cell and little cell.  And now the weight upon her, instead of lifting, soaring in the  possibility of the return of her old freedom, lay the more heavily, and  her sense of oppression became abysmal.... \"Something is going to  happen,\" she had kept saying. \"Something _has_ happened....\"    So she had got on toward her own door. There the swift relief was like  an upbearing into another air, charged with more intimate largess for  life. Now Mary sat in the stable in a sense of happy reality that  clothed all her feeling--rather, in a sense of superreality, which she  did not know how to accept.... So, slowly singing in her as she sat at  her task, came that which had waited until she should open the way....    In the stable there was that fusion of shadow and light in which captive  spaces reveal all their mystery. Little areas of brightness, of  functioning; then dimness, then the deep. Brightness in which surfaces  of worn floor, slivered wall, dusty glass, showed values more specific  than those of colour. Dimness in which gray rafters with wavering edges,  rough posts each with an accessory of shadow, an old harness in  grotesque loops, ceased to be background and assumed roles. The  background itself, modified by many an unshadowed promontory, was  accented in caverns of manger and roof. The place revealed mystery and  beauty in the casual business of saying what had to be said.    Mary filled her arms with hay, and turned to the manger. The raw smell  of the clover smote her, and it was as sweet as Spring repromised. She  stood for a moment with the hay in her arms, her breath coming  swiftly....    Down on the marsh, not half an hour away, he was coming to"]]]
