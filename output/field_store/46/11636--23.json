They are savages, living  chiefly in that low stage of being, Koom-Posh, tending necessarily to  its own hideous dissolution in Glek-Nas. Their wretched existence is  passed in perpetual contest and perpetual change. When they do not fight  with their neighbours, they fight among themselves. They are divided  into sections, which abuse, plunder, and sometimes murder each  other, and on the most frivolous points of difference that would be  unintelligible to us if we had not read history, and seen that we too  have passed through the same early state of ignorance and barbarism. Any  trifle is sufficient to set them together by the ears. They pretend to  be all equals, and the more they have struggled to be so, by removing  old distinctions, and starting afresh, the more glaring and intolerable  the disparity becomes, because nothing in hereditary affections and  associations is left to soften the one naked distinction between the  many who have nothing and the few who have much. Of course the many hate  the few, but without the few they could not live. The many are always  assailing the few; sometimes they exterminate the few; but as soon as  they have done so, a new few starts out of the many, and is harder  to deal with than the old few. For where societies are large, and  competition to have something is the predominant fever, there must be  always many losers and few gainers. In short, they are savages groping  their way in the dark towards some gleam of light, and would demand our  commiseration for their infirmities, if, like all savages, they did not  provoke their own destruction by their arrogance and cruelty. Can you  imagine that creatures of this kind, armed only with such miserable  weapons as you may see in our museum of antiquities, clumsy iron tubes  charged with saltpetre, have more than once threatened with destruction  a tribe of the Vril-ya, which dwells nearest to them, because they say  they have thirty millions of population--and that tribe may have fifty  thousand--if the latter do not accept their notions of Soc-Sec (money  getting) on some trading principles which they have the impudence to  call 'a law of civilisation'?\"    \"But thirty millions of population are formidable odds against fifty  thousand!\"    My host stared at me astonished. \"Stranger,\" said he, \"you could not  have heard me say that this threatened tribe belongs to the Vril-ya; and  it only waits for these savages to declare war, in order to commission  some half-a-dozen small children to sweep away their whole population.\"    At these words I felt a thrill of horror, recognising much more affinity  with \"the savages\" than I did with the Vril-ya, and remembering all I  had said in praise of the glorious American institutions, which Aph-Lin  stigmatised as Koom-Posh. Recovering my self-possession, I asked  if there were modes of transit by which I could safely visit this  temerarious and remote people.    \"You can travel with safety, by vril agency, either along the ground or  amid the air, throughout all the range of the communities with which  we are allied and akin; but I cannot vouch for your safety in barbarous  nations governed by different laws from ours; nations, indeed, so  benighted, that there are among them large numbers who actually live by  stealing from each other, and one could not with safety in the Silent  Hours even leave the doors of one's own house open.\"    Here our conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Taee, who came  to inform us that he, having been deputed to discover and destroy the  enormous reptile which I had seen on my first arrival, had been on the  watch for it ever since his visit to me, and had began to suspect that  my eyes had deceived me, or that the creature had made its way through  the cavities within the rocks to the wild regions in which dwelt its  kindred race,--when it gave evidences of its whereabouts by a great  devastation of the herbage bordering one of the lakes. \"And,\" said Taee,  \"I feel sure that within that lake it is now hiding. So,\" (turning to  me) \"I thought it might amuse you to accompany me to see the way we  destroy such unpleasant visitors.\" As I looked at the face of the young  child, and called to mind the enormous size of the creature he proposed  to exterminate, I felt myself shudder with fear for him, and perhaps  fear for myself, if I accompanied him in such a chase. But my curiosity  to witness the destructive effects of the boasted vril, and my  unwillingness to lower myself in the eyes of an infant by betraying  apprehensions of personal safety, prevailed over my first impulse.  Accordingly, I thanked Taee for his courteous consideration for my  amusement, and professed my willingness to set out with him on so  diverting an enterprise.        Chapter XVIII.      As Taee and myself, on quitting the town, and leaving to the left the  main road which led to it, struck into the fields, the strange and  solemn beauty of the landscape, lighted up, by numberless lamps, to the  verge of the horizon, fascinated my eyes, and rendered me for some time  an inattentive listener to the talk of my companion.    Along our way various operations of agriculture were being carried on by  machinery, the forms of which were new to me, and for the most part very  graceful; for among these people art being so cultivated for the sake  of mere utility, exhibits itself in adorning or refining the shapes of  useful objects. Precious metals and gems are so profuse among them, that  they are lavished on things devoted to purposes the most commonplace;  and their love of utility leads them to beautify its tools, and quickens  their imagination in a way unknown to themselves.    In all service, whether in or out of doors, they make great use  of automaton figures, which are so ingenious, and so pliant to the  operations of vril, that they actually seem gifted with reason. It  was scarcely possible to distinguish the figures I beheld, apparently  guiding or superintending the rapid movements of vast engines, from  human forms endowed with thought.    By degrees, as we continued to walk on, my attention became roused by  the lively and acute remarks of my companion. The intelligence of the  children among this race is marvellously precocious, perhaps from the  habit of having intrusted to them, at so early an age, the toils and  responsibilities of middle age. Indeed, in conversing with Taee, I felt  as if talking with some superior and observant man of my own years. I  asked him if he could form any estimate of the number of communities  into which the race of the Vril-ya is subdivided.    \"Not exactly,\" he said, \"because they multiply, of course, every year as  the surplus of each community is drafted off. But I heard my father say  that, according to the last report, there were a million and a half of  communities speaking our language, and adopting our institutions and  forms of life and government; but, I believe, with some differences,  about which you had better ask Zee. She knows more than most of the Ana  do. An An cares less for things that do not concern him than a Gy does;  the Gy-ei are inquisitive creatures.\"    \"Does each community restrict itself to the same number of families or  amount of population that you do?\"    \"No; some have much smaller populations, some have larger--varying  according to the extent of the country they appropriate, or to the  degree of excellence to which they have brought their machinery. Each  community sets its own limit according to circumstances, taking care  always that there shall never arise any class of poor by the pressure of  population upon the productive powers of the domain; and that no  state shall be too large for a government resembling that of a  single well-ordered family. I imagine that no vril community exceeds  thirty-thousand households. But, as a general rule, the smaller  the community, provided there be hands enough to do justice to the  capacities of the territory it occupies, the richer each individual is,  and the larger the sum contributed to the general treasury,--above all,  the happier and the more tranquil is the whole political body, and the  more perfect the products of its industry. The state which all tribes of  the Vril-ya acknowledge to be the highest in civilisation, and which  has brought the vril force to its fullest development, is perhaps the  smallest. It limits itself to four thousand families; but every inch of  its territory is cultivated to the utmost perfection of garden ground;  its machinery excels that of every other tribe, and there is no  product of its industry in any department which is not sought for, at  extraordinary prices, by each community of our race. All our tribes make  this state their model, considering that we should reach the highest  state of civilisation allowed to mortals if we could unite the greatest  degree of happiness with the highest degree of intellectual achievement;  and it is clear that the smaller the society the less difficult that  will be. Ours is too large for it.\"    This reply set me thinking. I reminded myself of that little state of  Athens, with only twenty thousand free citizens, and which to this  day our mightiest nations regard as the supreme guide and model in all  departments of intellect. But then Athens permitted fierce rivalry and  perpetual change, and was certainly not happy. Rousing myself from the  reverie into which these reflections had plunged me, I brought back our  talk to the subjects connected with emigration.    \"But,\" said I, \"when, I suppose yearly, a certain number among you agree  to quit home and found a new community elsewhere, they must necessarily  be very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#18)"],[1,"atience, or Pretella, is the  projecting bracket on the under-side of the seats of stalls in churches:  these, where perfect, are fixed with hinges so that they may be turned  up, and when this is done the projection of the miserere is sufficient,  without actually forming a seat, to afford very considerable rest to any  one leaning upon it. They were allowed as a relief to the infirm during  the long services that were required to be performed by ecclesiastics  in a standing posture. They are always more or less ornamented with  carvings of leaves, small figures, animals, etc., which are generally  very boldly cut. Examples are to be found in almost all ancient churches  which retain any of the ancient stalls--one of the oldest remaining  specimens is in Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster; it is in the style  of the thirteenth century.\" When Parker wrote the last sentence the  still older miserere now to be seen at Christchurch had not been  discovered.        [5] She lived in the latter half of the thirteenth century.    [Illustration: CHOIR STALLS.]    [Illustration: MISERERE ON STALL SEAT. (_Circa_ 1300.) NORTH SIDE.]    It is curious to notice the absence of reverence on the part of the  mediaeval canons, according to our modern notions, that these quaint  carvings indicate. One might have expected that inside the church the  subjects would have always been of a sacred nature, rude perhaps, and  grotesque from their rudeness. Such carvings are found in many places,  but here at Christchurch we have satirical subjects, caricatures of  contemporaries, some indeed of so objectionable a character that they  have been removed of late years. A few examples of these carvings will  be given. On the arm of one of the stalls a fox is represented preaching  to a flock of geese, a cock acting as clerk. On one of the misereres we  have a pair of devils somewhat resembling monkeys tempting an angel, a  goose bringing an offering on a plate to a quaint figure, a man with  a hatchet employed in carving, a man with a hole in the back of his  garments fastened with a pin, besides various animals, fishes, mermaids,  and monsters. On the wainscoting we have the heads of Henry VII., Henry  VIII., Catharine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Cardinal Campeggio, the King of  Scots, and the Duchess of Burgundy, who assisted Perkin Warbeck in his  attempt to gain the crown of England, and two canons disputing over a  cup, which is placed between their faces. This last carving probably has  some reference to the granting of the cup to the laity in time of Henry  VIII.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR.]    The vaulting of the choir is of a somewhat unusual character: the  pendants are especially worthy of notice. It is difficult to describe  the manner in which they are placed, but the illustration shows their  character and position. The short connecting ribs of the vaulting form  a stellated cross over the presbytery. Some colour may still be seen on  the carved work of this portion of the church, and the initials of  William Eyre, prior 1502-1520, appear on the bosses.    [Illustration: THE REREDOS.]    The east wall of the presbytery contains no window, but is occupied by  a beautiful stone reredos carved with a representation of the tree of  Jesse. It is divided into three tiers with five compartments in each,  the central one wider than the two on either side; the space above it  and beneath the vaulting is occupied by a wall, in which a doorway now  blocked up may be seen. The outer compartments of the lowest tier  contain doors leading to a platform behind the reredos; between them  stands an oak altar, the gift of A. N. Welby Pugin in 1831. Above the  altar in the central compartment Jesse lies asleep, on the left hand  David plays upon his harp, on the right sits Solomon deeply meditating.  Above Jesse we have in one carving an amalgamated representation of the  birth of Christ and the visit of the Wise Men. On the left hand sits the  Virgin Mary with her Child, fully clothed in a long garment, not wrapped  in swaddling clothes, standing in her lap; behind her stands a man,  probably Joseph; and before her kneels one of the Wise Men offering  his gift of gold in the form of a plain tankard; on the right behind  him stand his two fellows, one carrying a pot of myrrh, the other  a boat-shaped vessel, probably intended for a censer containing  frankincense. On a bracket above the head of the kneeling Wise Man,  the shepherds kneel in adoration; nor are the flocks that they were  tending forgotten, for several sheep may be seen on a hill-top above  their heads. Thirty-two small figures may be counted in niches in the  buttresses dividing the compartments; crockets, finials, and pinnacles  decorate the various canopies over the carvings. This reredos is  apparently of late Decorated date, and therefore earlier than the  fifteenth-century choir. Possibly it was an addition to the Norman choir  before this was removed to make room for the existing one. Mr Ferrey  was of opinion that it may have once stood across the nave between the  second piers from the east, thus forming a reredos for the western part  of the nave, which was used as the church of the parish. Below the  presbytery is a Norman crypt, now converted into a vault for the  Malmesbury family. It has already been mentioned that there are doors  on either side of the altar, leading to a kind of gallery or platform  behind the reredos; these were designed to allow certain ceremonial  compassings of the altar, and it is possible that steps led down from  the platform to the ambulatory. On the east side of these doorways  there are corbel heads under the arches, and the walls of the platform  are panelled. Within the altar rails is a slab bearing the name of  Baldwin IV., the seventh Earl of Devon. On the south side is the  monument of Lady Fitzharris, who died in 1815; it is a statue by Flaxman  representing the Lady teaching her two sons from the Bible. Farther to  the east is the altar tomb of the Countess of Malmesbury, who died in  1877, occupying the place of the sedilia; and on the north the exquisite  chantry of Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, the last bearer of the royal  name of Plantagenet, whose tragic fate and horrible execution is one  of the foulest stains on the memory of Henry VIII. She was the daughter  of \"false, fleeting, perjured Clarence\" and of the kingmaker's eldest  daughter Isabella, and was mother of the celebrated Reginald Pole who,  being ordained deacon at the age of sixteen, was appointed Dean of  Wimborne a year later, and rose in time to the high rank of  Cardinal-Archbishop of Canterbury, and played an important part in  history in the reigns of Henry VIII. and Mary. She erected this lovely  chantry as her last resting-place, wishing to lie after her troublous  life in this quiet spot, but it was not so to be. Her son, by the  publication on the Continent of a violent attack on Henry VIII.,  incensed the king to such an extent that he laid his hands on all the  kindred of the Poles he could find in England; some were tried and  executed, others attainted without trial, among them the Countess of  Salisbury, who was at the time over seventy years of age. She refused to  lay her head upon the block, and the headsman hacked at her neck as she  stood erect; her body was not allowed to be buried in the chantry which  she had erected for herself,--so far did the spite of Henry go,--but she  lies among the ambitious and unfortunate, the aspiring, and unsuccessful  of many a sect and party in the cemetery of St Peter's Chapel in the  Tower. Hers was an ill-starred race. Her grandfather was slain at  Barnet, 1471; her father murdered by his brother Edward IV., 1478; her  own brother, the Earl of Warwick, imprisoned by Henry VII., and  subsequently beheaded on Tower Hill, 1499; her eldest son, Lord Montagu,  was executed for high treason; and Margaret herself met a like fate on  May 27, 1541.    [Illustration: THE SALISBURY CHANTRY.]    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE SALISBURY CHANTRY.]    Her chantry is built of Caen stone, and the decoration is of Renaissance  character. It is conjectured to be the work of the Florentine sculptor  Pietro Torrigiano, who died in the prison of the Inquisition in Spain in  1522. He was engaged on Henry VII.'s tomb in Westminster, and other  works ordered by Henry VIII. at Westminster and Windsor, from 1509 till  1517; and if this chantry at Christchurch is his design the date must  lie between these two years. Two four-light windows with battlemented  transoms look out on either side; to the west of these two doorways  lead, one to the presbytery the other to the north aisle; on the east  wall are three canopied niches, beneath which an altar stood or was  intended to stand; the ceiling is richly carved with fan traceries and  bosses; the latter have been mutilated--by order, it is said, of Henry  VIII. A letter from the King's Commissioner thus describes the work  done:--\"In thys churche we founde a chaple and a monumet curiosly made  of cane stone p^rpared by the late mother of Raynolde Pole for herre  buriall, which we have causyd to be defaced and all the Armis and Badgis  to be delete.\" On the north side are twelve tabernacles. This chapel  stands on a richly carved panelled basement, and all the walls are  covered with minute carving; but here, as elsewhere, in late work we  find the same forms repeated again and again, and we miss that wealth  of fancy which gives each boss or capital carved by the earlier workers  such a life and individuality. The side of this chapel that faces the  north aisle is more elaborate than that facing the choir, and is  necessarily more lofty, as its base rests on the floor of the aisle,  which is lower than the floor of the presbytery. On the west face is  one of several memorial tablets to members of the Rose family, who are  buried in this aisle.    In the north choir aisle, at the"]]]
