They found the cattle all right, and visibly improved by their three  days' rest, while Leo, the lion cub, welcomed Dick's return with almost  embarrassing demonstrations of affection.  Late that same evening Mafuta  also returned, with the intelligence that although he had not actually  seen either elephants or buffaloes, he had obtained, from natives whom  he had encountered, intelligence of a large herd of the former at a  distance of four days' trek from the river.  He also reported the  natives to be quite friendly disposed and willing to allow the white men  to traverse their particular section of country.  Everything thus  appearing favourable, on the following morning the oxen were once more  inspanned, and the journey resumed.    Then ensued a long trek extending over a period of more than two months,  including a day's halt here and there to rest the oxen, or to indulge in  a little hunting, during which they enjoyed excellent sport among  elephants, buffaloes, lions, leopards, giraffe, veldebeeste, zebra,  ostriches, and the various species of buck to be found in the southern  portion of the great African Continent; so rapidly, indeed, did their  spoils accumulate that at length they could no longer find room for them  in the wagon, and were glad to avail themselves of the opportunity  afforded by their arrival at a particularly friendly village to leave  everything of the kind, including some eighteen hundred pounds of ivory,  in charge of the villagers.    Of the last three weeks of this long trek, nine days were consumed in  forced marches through sterile country, bordering a wide and--according  to Mafuta--utterly impassable desert, during which both water and grass  were so exceedingly scarce that the entire party suffered terrible  privation, no game of any kind being seen, where more than half the oxen  died, while the remainder were reduced to such a miserable condition  that they were scarcely able to drag the now more than half-empty wagon.  Presently the character of the country gradually changed, a water-hole  or two were found, with small patches of fairly nutritious grass growing  round them, and as soon as a favourable spot was reached the wagon was  outspanned and the oxen allowed a couple of days' holiday in which to  rest and recuperate.  Then Grosvenor and Dick, mounting their horses,  which had been spared as much as possible during the preceding ten days,  set off with their rifles in search of game, and eventually succeeded in  finding and shooting a pair of bush buck wherewith to replenish their  larder.    At the end of the second day's rest Mafuta--who had by this time  completely won the confidence of the two leaders of the expedition, and  had attained rather to the position of a humble comrade than a mere  follower--gave it as his opinion that the oxen had now sufficiently  recovered to justify the party in resuming their journey; and  accordingly on the following morning the animals were once more  inspanned.  Dick and Grosvenor had already seen enough of the  surrounding country during their two days' foraging expedition to have  come to the conclusion that conditions would now improve with every mile  of progress, and this conclusion was fully borne out by their first  day's experiences, the country gradually becoming more hilly and broken,  with small watercourses occurring at steadily decreasing intervals, with  more and richer grass at every mile of their progress, until by the end  of the day they once more found themselves in a district that might  fairly be termed fertile, while a few head of game--bucks and a brace of  paow (a kind of bustard)--had been seen.  All this was exceedingly  encouraging to the two explorers, for their experiences thus far--with  one very important exception--had been in strict accordance with  Menzies' story, as repeated to them by their friend Mitchell, and  confirmed them in the conviction that at length they had arrived within  measurable distance of the spot where, according to the account given by  the former, the ruins of ancient Ophir still existed in recognisable  form.  The exception referred to consisted in the fact that whereas,  according to Menzies, the Makolo nation, upon whose territory they had  now entered, were exceedingly jealous of all intrusion--Menzies himself  having escaped a frightful death at their hands by the very skin of his  teeth--they had thus far met with no molestation whatever; which,  however, might possibly be accounted for by the fact that thus far they  had seen no natives.    But this state of affairs was not to last much longer; for on the third  day of their resumed trek, by which time they had reached a somewhat  rugged, well-wooded stretch of country, watered by numerous streams,  upon surmounting a ridge they sighted a native village, some three miles  ahead, surrounded by well-cultivated fields which, upon their nearer  approach, the travellers found to consist chiefly of maize and tobacco,  with here and there a patch of sugar cane, or a small fruit orchard.  Soon afterwards they encountered a large herd of cattle in charge of  about a dozen native lads, one of whom, upon sighting the strangers,  took to his heels and ran, as though for his life, to an eminence at no  great distance, where, placing his hands funnelwise to his mouth, he  began to shout, in a peculiar, high-pitched tone of voice, a brief  communication of some sort to some unseen person or persons.  At the  same time one of the other lads, after intently scrutinising the  newcomers for several minutes, advanced cautiously toward them and  finally halted--evidently holding himself ready to bolt at the slightest  suspicious sign--and, raising his sheaf of assagais in his right hand by  way of salute, shouted the single word:    \"_Bietu_!\"    The word was evidently a variant of the Zulu _Biete_, the form of  salutation addressed to a great chief, and, so construing it, Mafuta at  once placed his shield and weapons in the wagon and, advancing rapidly,  proceeded to address the lad in good Zulu.  The stranger, however,  although it was evident that he caught the meaning of a word here and  there, seemed unable to grasp the sense of Mafuta's communication in its  entirety, whereupon the latter made a second attempt, this time using a  sort of dialect or corruption of the true Zulu tongue; and was now more  successful, quite a long interchange of conversation ensuing, at the  termination of which the stranger turned and ran to the before-mentioned  eminence, from the summit of which he shouted, in the same high-pitched  voice as his predecessor, a communication of very considerable length,  while Mafuta returned to the wagon.    \"Well, Mafuta, what is the news?\" demanded Dick, as the Kaffir  approached.    \"The news, Chief, is good,\" answered Mafuta, saluting.  \"We have arrived  within the borders of the Makolo country; and the word of the _'mfana_  who spoke with me is that it will be wise of my fathers to outspan at  the first suitable halting place until the will of the king regarding  them be made known.  The Makolo do not approve of strangers entering  their country, it would appear; but their objection no longer applies to  white men, to whom the Spirits of the Winds have commanded that all  kindness be shown, should such ever visit the Makolo country.  News of  our arrival has already been sent forward to Lobelalatutu, the king; and  his will concerning us will be made known as soon as it comes; but,  meanwhile, Matemba, the _'mfana_ who spoke with me, advises that we  outspan until that will be made known.\"    \"Um!\" remarked Dick; \"that does not sound altogether promising, eh,  Phil?  Seems to indicate that there may possibly be difficulties put in  the way of our penetrating the country, doesn't it?  What did you say to  the _'mfana_ Mafuta?\"    \"I said,\" answered Mafuta, \"that the two white men, my chiefs, had come  from afar across the Great Water to visit Lobelalatutu, the King of the  great Makolo nation, to offer presents, and to request his permission to  examine the ruins of the great city of which they had heard.\"    \"Yes, of course; I suppose that was the correct diplomatic way in which  to put the matter,\" remarked Dick.  \"And what said Matemba in reply?\"    \"He said,\" answered Mafuta, \"that doubtless the king, remembering the  commands laid upon him by the Spirits of the Winds, upon the occasion of  their last visit to the country in their great glittering ship which  flies through the air, would gladly permit my chiefs to visit the ruins,  even as the Spirits themselves had done.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Dick; \"that sounds better.  But,\"--turning to  Grosvenor--\"I wonder what the fellow means by the `glittering ship which  flies through the air'--and the `Spirits of the Winds'?  Can it be  possible that an airship has ever penetrated so far as this?  Stop a  minute--let me think.  `Spirits of the Winds--glittering ship which  flies'--by Jove! can it be possible?  I thought, when I heard the  expression `Spirits of the Winds' that it sounded not altogether  unfamiliar, that I had met with it before, in fact; and now that I come  to overhaul my memory I very distinctly remember reading a yarn  describing the adventures of some people who possessed a wonderful  airship in which they made the most extraordinary voyages and met with  some astounding experiences--\"    \"Yes,\" interrupted Grosvenor; \"I know the book you mean.  I, too, read  it.  But I took it to be fiction, pure and simple; a somewhat daring  flight of a novelist's imagination."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#18)"],[1,"was now springing up again,  fresh and green, in little irregular patches, all over the open area.  The spot would serve admirably for an ambuscade, for while it was  sufficiently open to permit of straight shooting, there was cover enough  to conceal a hundred men, or more, at need.  But what made the place  especially suitable for our purpose was the fact that away over in one  corner of the clearing there grew a thick, dense belt of wild cactus,  newly sprung up, fresh, tough, and vigorous, every leaf being thickly  studded with long, strong, sharp spikes growing so closely together that  nothing living would dare to face it, or attempt to force a passage  through it--or, at all events, if they should be foolhardy enough to try  it once they would not attempt it a second time.  It immediately  occurred to me--and Cupid promptly corroborated my view--that if our  party could but find or make a way in behind this belt of cactus, they  would be at once in a natural fort from which it would be impossible to  dislodge them, and after further careful investigation a passage was  found through the bush by which our lads could easily gain access to the  interior of the cactus fort, and hold it against all comers.  There was  therefore no need to search farther; the place was admirably adapted to  our requirements; and, once satisfied of this, I bade Cupid proceed on  his way in quest of the approaching cauffle, while I leisurely wended my  way back to the dinghy and, with a single oar thrown out over the stern,  sculled myself back to the factory.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    LA BELLE ESTELLE.    My first act upon my return was, of course, to report the result of my  reconnaissance to the captain, who, after hearing what I had to say,  came to the conclusion that he would personally inspect the spot which I  had selected as the scene of the proposed ambuscade; and accordingly,  ordering the second cutter to be manned, we pushed off, taking Mr  Hoskins with us, and towing the dinghy, which was to be left on the  other side for the convenience of Cupid, upon that individual's return.    When we at length reached the place the skipper was so pleased with it  that he at once determined to set a strong party to work upon it, partly  to keep the hands employed--there being by this time very little to do  at the factory--and partly that the necessary preparations might be  completed at the earliest possible moment.  Accordingly he gave Hoskins,  who was to have charge of the working-party, the most elaborate  instructions as to how to proceed and what to do.  The work was put in  hand that same day; and when Hoskins and his party returned to quarters  that night the former reported that the whole of the work absolutely  necessary to insure the success of the ambuscade had been done, and that  only about another hour's work, on the following day, was required to  complete the whole of what the skipper had ordered.    The next day, accordingly, the party crossed to the mainland to complete  the preparation of the ambuscade, returning, in good time for dinner,  with the report that all was now done, and that the spot was ready for  occupation at a moment's notice.  As it happened, it was just as well  that we had acted with such promptitude and expedition, for the men were  still engaged upon their mid-day meal when Cupid was seen returning in  the dinghy.  The fellow had evidently travelled fast and far, for he was  smothered in dust, and so done up that he could scarcely drag one leg  after another--there is nothing that puts one out of walking condition  more quickly than being pent up for long periods on board a ship.    But, despite his fatigue, he was puffed up with pride and importance,  for he had accomplished the mission upon which he had been despatched,  and in a very satisfactory manner, too.  His report was to the effect  that he had travelled at a good pace all through the preceding day, and  that at nightfall, while still plodding forward, keeping his eyes wide  open, meanwhile, on the look-out for a suitable camping spot, he had  suddenly detected in the air a smell of burning wood and dry leaves,  and, proceeding cautiously a little further, had become aware of a low,  confused murmuring, as that of the voices of many people, together with  a brisk crackling sound which he at once recognised as that of camp  fires.  A minute or two later, having meanwhile taken cover, he sighted  the camp, which proved to be, as he had of course expected, that of the  slave-traders and their unhappy victims.    The caravan, or \"cauffle,\" had just camped for the night, and its  members were busily engaged in preparing the evening meal, Cupid was  therefore able to approach the camp closely enough to catch a great deal  of the conversation of the slave-traders, as well as to make a pretty  accurate guess at their number and that of their victims.  Later on he  was able to ascertain the exact number of the former, which totalled  eighty-two, while the slaves he estimated to number from a thousand to  fifteen hundred.  Maintaining his concealment, but steadily working his  way ever closer to the camp fire, the Krooboy ultimately wriggled  himself into a position so close to the spot where the chiefs of the  band had seated themselves that he was able without difficulty to catch  every word spoken by them; and although his knowledge of the Spanish and  Portuguese languages was exceedingly limited, yet by listening patiently  to everything that was said during the somewhat dilatory progress of the  meal, and afterwards while the leaders smoked and chatted prior to  turning-in for the night, he was able to gather that the remaining  distance of the journey was to be divided into three marches, the last  of which was to bring the party to the shore of the lagoon pretty early  in the afternoon of the day following that of Cupid's return to us.    Then, having learned this, the Krooboy had waited until the leaders of  the expedition had bestowed themselves for the night, and the occupants  of the camp generally were settling to rest after the hot and toilsome  march of the past day, when he cautiously left his place of concealment  and, mingling with the unhappy captives, had contrived to communicate to  several of them the joyful news that in due time, and upon their arrival  at a certain spot already fixed upon, the cauffle would be ambuscaded  and the dealers and escort attacked and captured, after which the slaves  would be released and supplied with food and water to enable them to  return to their homes.  He did this, he said, not only to comfort and  encourage them but also to put them on their guard against falling into  a panic at the critical moment and getting themselves hurt.    The skipper listened very carefully to this story, cross-examined the  narrator upon several points, and then dismissed him to get food and  rest.  That same afternoon the captain, accompanied, as before, by  Lieutenant Hoskins, again visited the place of ambush, and presumably  made final arrangements for the capture of the cauffle, but what they  were I did not know, for I was left behind, with Tompson, the gunner, in  charge of the factory, with instructions to overhaul our stock of arms  and ammunition, and see that everything of that kind was made perfectly  ready for the next day's work.    When the next day arrived and all hands were mustered for inspection  prior to the choosing of the ambuscading party, I learned to my disgust  that I was to be left behind, with the other invalids, to look after the  factory, Hutchinson having reported that I was not yet fit for duty,  although, like a full dozen others who had been hurt in one or another  of our recent fights, I was able to be up and about, and to attend to  matters not requiring the use of both arms.  But the slave-traders were  known to be, as a general rule, determined fellows, and it was certain  that, in the present case, with such a rich haul in their possession,  they would fight desperately in defence of their booty.  The skipper  therefore determined to take only sound men with him, concluding that  \"lame ducks\" would be more of a hindrance than a help to him.    With envious eyes I watched the departure of the skipper and his party--  in three boats, namely, the launch and the first and second cutters--and  then walked moodily away from the wharf to perform a duty inspection of  the sick wards.  The place wore an unnaturally quiet and deserted look,  as I crossed the great open space between the wharf and the building  which we had converted into a hospital; for there was nobody about  excepting a round dozen or so of convalescents, well enough to sit out  on the gallery under the shade of the verandah, and the solitary  watcher, perched aloft in the crow's-nest which we had rigged among the  topmost branches of one of the most lofty trees on the island, in order  to maintain a watch upon the lagoon, and give us timely notice of the  approach of a slaver.    Sauntering quietly along, for the heat was already intense, I entered  the hospital building and proceeded with the usual daily inspection of  the wards, which I found were to-day in Murdoch's charge, Hutchinson  having been detailed to accompany the skipper's party.  The invalids  were all doing excellently, thanks, no doubt, in a great measure, to the  fine, airy room in which they had been bestowed; some, indeed, were so  far advanced toward recovery that Murdoch had given three or four of  them permission to leave their beds and go into the open air for an hour  or two, and these were now assisting each other to dress.  I completed  my rounds, both of this building and also of that in which the wounded  prisoners were lodged, and was just leaving the latter when I caught  sight of one of the convalescents hurrying toward me at a great rate, in  the full glare of the sunshine, in direct defiance of the medico's  standing"]]]
