This was all the  more unfortunate that we were now almost within a couple of hundred  yards of the mouth of the cave.    Makarooroo spoke encouragingly to her, but she was unable to reply, and  it became evident that she was about to sink down altogether.  Jack  glanced over his shoulder.  The two negroes were within fifty yards of  us, but no others were in sight.    \"Hold my gun,\" said Jack to me sharply.    I seized it.  He instantly stooped down, grasped Okandaga round the  waist, and without stopping, swung her, with an exertion of strength  that seemed to me incredible, into his arms.  We gained the mouth of the  cavern; Jack dropped Okandaga, who immediately ran in, while the rest of  us stopped abruptly and faced about.    \"Back, all of you,\" cried Jack, \"else they will be afraid to come on.\"    The words had scarcely passed his lips when the two negroes came up, but  halted a few yards from the mouth of the cave on seeing such a giant  form guarding the entrance.    To let those men escape and reveal the place of our concealment was not  to be thought of.  Jack darted out upon them.  They separated from each  other as they turned to fly.  I was peeping out of the cave, and saw  that Jack could not secure them both; I therefore darted out, and  quickly overtaking one, seized him by the hair of the head and dragged  him into the cave with the aid of Peterkin.  Jack lifted the other  savage completely from the ground, and carried him in struggling in his  gripe like a child in its nurse's arms.    This last episode was enacted so quickly that the two negroes were  carried into the cavern and gagged before the other pursuers came up.  At the cave's mouth the whole of the men of the village shortly  assembled with the king at their head.  Thus far the excitement of the  chase had led them; but now that the first burst of their rage was over,  and they found themselves on the threshold of that haunted cavern, the  fear of which had been an element in their training from infancy, they  felt, no doubt, overawed by superstitious dread, and hesitated to enter,  although most of them must have been convinced that the fugitives were  there.  Their fears increased as their anger abated, and they crowded  round King Jambai, who seemed loath to take upon himself the honour of  leader.    \"They must have sought shelter here,\" said the king, pointing to the  cavern and looking round with an assumption of boldness which he was  evidently far from feeling.  \"Who among my warriors will follow me?\"    \"Perhaps the evil spirits have carried them away,\" suggested one of the  sable crew.    \"That is the word of a coward,\" cried the king, who, although somewhat  timorous about spirits, was in reality a bold, brave man, and felt  nettled that any of his warriors should show the white feather.  \"If  evil spirits are there, our fetishman will drive them away.  Let the  doctor stand forth.\"    At that moment the doctor, worthy knave, must have wished in his inmost  soul that he had remained quietly at home and left to warriors the task  of capturing the fugitives, but there was no resisting the mandate of  the king; besides, his honour and credit as a fetishman was at stake;  moreover, no doubt he felt somewhat emboldened by the presence of such a  large number of men--there were certainly several hundreds on the  ground--so, all things considered, he thought it best to accept the post  of leader with a good grace.  Stepping quickly forward, he cried, \"Let  torches be brought, and I will lead the way.\"    A murmur of approbation ran through the crowd of blacks, who, like a  flock of sheep, felt bold enough to follow a leader blindly.    While the consultation was going on outside, we were making hasty  preparation for defending ourselves to the last extremity.  Peterkin, in  particular, was extremely active, and, to say truth, his actions  surprised us not a little.  I once or twice fancied that excitement had  turned his brain.  He first dressed up his head in a species of wild  turban made of dried grass and tall sedgy leaves; then he put several  patches of red and white earth on his black face, as well as on his body  in various places, and fastened a number of loose pieces of rag, torn  from a handkerchief, and bits of tattered leaves to his arms and legs in  such a manner as to give him an extremely wild and dishevelled  appearance.  I must say that when his hasty toilet was completed he  seemed to me the most horrible-looking demon I had ever conceived of.  He next poured out nearly a whole flask of gunpowder on a ledge of rock,  the edge of which was visible from the entrance to the cave, while the  rock itself concealed him from view.  Last of all, he took up the three  cones of moistened gunpowder which the reader will remember he had made  before we left the cave to attack the village.  One of these he placed  among the grass and branches on his head, the other two he held in his  hands.    \"Now, boys,\" he said, when all was ready, \"all I have to ask of you is  that you will stand by with matches, and when I give the word light the  points of those three cones of gunpowder simultaneously and instantly,  and leave me to finish the remainder of my part.  Of course you will be  prepared to back me up with your rifles if need be, but keep well out of  sight at first.\"    We now saw the drift of our eccentric friend's intention, but for my  part I felt little confidence in his success.  The plan seemed  altogether too wild and absurd.  But our danger was imminent.  No way of  escape seemed possible, and it is wonderful how readily men will grasp  at anything in the shape of a ruse or stratagem, no matter how silly or  wild, that affords the most distant chance of escape from danger.  Jack,  too, I could see from the look of his face, put little faith in the  plan; and I observed an expression on the countenance of our negro guide  which seemed to indicate that his respect for Peterkin's wisdom was on  the wane.    We had not to wait long.  The doctor, with several torch-bearers,  suddenly darted in with a shout, followed closely by the warriors, who  yelled furiously, in order, no doubt, to keep up their courage.    Alarmed by such an unusual hubbub in their usually quiet domain, the  bats came swooping from their holes in the walls by hundreds, and the  torches were extinguished almost instantly.  The savages who were near  the entrance drew back in haste; those who had entered stood rooted to  the spot in terror.    \"Now!\" whispered Peterkin eagerly.    We struck our lights at once and applied them to the points of the  gunpowder cones, which instantly began to spout forth a shower of sparks  with great violence.  Peterkin darted out from behind the rock with a  yell so appalling that we ourselves were startled by it, having  forgotten that it formed an element in his plan.  In passing he allowed  a few sparks to fall on the heap of powder, which exploded with so  bright a flame that the whole cavern was illuminated for an instant.  It  also set fire to the ragged scraps with which Peterkin had decked  himself out--a result which had neither been intended nor anticipated--  so that he rushed towards the mouth of the cave howling with pain as  well as with a desire to scare the savages.    The effect of this apparition was tremendous.  The negroes turned and  crushed through the narrow entrance screaming and shrieking with terror.  The bats, no less alarmed than the men, and half suffocated with smoke,  fled out of the cave like a whirlwind, flapping their wings on the heads  of the negroes in their flight, and adding, if that were possible, to  their consternation.  The negroes ran as never men ran before, tumbling  over each other in their mad haste, dashing against trees and crashing  through bushes in their terror, while Peterkin stood leaping in the  cave's mouth, smoking and blazing and spurting, and unable to contain  himself, giving vent to prolonged peals of demoniacal laughter.  Had the  laugh been that of negroes it might have been recognised; but Peterkin's  was the loud, violent, British guffaw, which, I make no doubt, was  deemed by them worthy of the fiends of the haunted cave, and served to  spur them on to still greater rapidity in their wild career.    Returning into the cave's innermost recess, we lighted one of the  torches dropped by the savages, and placing it in a sort of natural  niche, seated ourselves on several pieces of rock to rest.    Our first act was to look earnestly in each other's faces; our next to  burst into peals of laughter.    \"I say, comrades,\" I exclaimed, checking myself, \"don't we run some risk  in giving vent to our feelings so freely?\"    \"No fear,\" cried Peterkin, who was still smoking a little from  unextinguished sparks.  \"There is not a man in the whole crew who will  draw rein till he is sitting, with the teeth still chattering in his  head, at his own fireside.  I never saw men in such a fright since I was  born.  Depend upon it, we are safe enough here from this day forth.--  Don't you think so, Mak?\"    Our guide, who was now trying to reassure his trembling bride, turned,  with a broad grin on his sable countenance, and said--    \"Safe? ho! yis, massa.  Dere not be a man as'll come to dis yere cuvern  for de nix tree hun'r year or more.  Massa Peterkin be de most  horriboble ghost dey ever did saw, an' no mistake.  But, massas, we mus'  go 'way quick an' git to our camp, for de king sure to go dere an' see  if you no hab someting to do wid it all.  Him's a bery clebber king, am  Jambai--bery clebber; him's no be bughummed bery easy.\"    \"Humbugged, you mean,\" said Jack, laughing.  \"You're right, Mak; we must  set off at once.  But what _are_ we to do with poor Okandaga, now that  we have got her?\"    This was indeed a puzzling question.  It was impossible to take her to  our camp and account to the negroes for her appearance in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#18)"],[1,"together as the painters  express it, from whence proceeds that strong marked character of  individual nature which is so remarkable in his portraits, and is not to  be found in an equal degree in any other painter.  If he had joined to  this most difficult part of the art a patience in finishing what he had  so correctly planned, he might justly have claimed the place which  Vandyke, all things considered, so justly holds as the first of portrait  painters.    Others of the same school have shown great power in expressing the  character and passions of those vulgar people which are the subjects of  their study and attention.  Amongst those, Jean Stein seems to be one of  the most diligent and accurate observers of what passed in those scenes  which he frequented, and which were to him an academy.  I can easily  imagine that if this extraordinary man had had the good fortune to have  been born in Italy instead of Holland, had he lived in Rome instead of  Leyden, and had been blessed with Michael Angelo and Raffaelle for his  masters instead of Brower and Van Gowen, that the same sagacity and  penetration which distinguished so accurately the different characters  and expression in his vulgar figures, would, when exerted in the  selection and imitation of what was great and elevated in nature, have  been equally successful, and his name would have been now ranged with the  great pillars and supporters of our art.    Men who, although thus bound down by the almost invincible powers of  early habits, have still exerted extraordinary abilities within their  narrow and confined circle, and have, from the natural vigour of their  mind, given such an interesting expression, such force and energy to  their works, though they cannot be recommended to be exactly imitated,  may yet invite an artist to endeavour to transfer, by a kind of parody,  those excellences to his own works.  Whoever has acquired the power of  making this use of the Flemish, Venetian, and French schools is a real  genius, and has sources of knowledge open to him which were wanting to  the great artists who lived in the great age of painting.    To find excellences however dispersed, to discover beauties however  concealed by the multitude of defects with which they are surrounded, can  be the work only of him who, having a mind always alive to his art, has  extended his views to all ages and to all schools, and has acquired from  that comprehensive mass which he has thus gathered to himself, a well  digested and perfect idea of his art, to which everything is referred.  Like a sovereign judge and arbiter of art, he is possessed of that  presiding power which separates and attracts every excellence from every  school, selects both from what is great and what is little, brings home  knowledge from the east and from the west, making the universe tributary  towards furnishing his mind and enriching his works with originality and  variety of inventions.    Thus I have ventured to give my opinion of what appears to me the true  and only method by which an artist makes himself master of his  profession, which I hold ought to be one continued course of imitation,  that is not to cease but with our lives.    Those who, either from their own engagements and hurry of business, or  from indolence, or from conceit and vanity, have neglected looking out of  themselves, as far as my experience and observation reaches, have from  that time not only ceased to advance and improve in their performance,  but have gone backward.  They may be compared to men who have lived upon  their principal till they are reduced to beggary and left without  resources.    I can recommend nothing better, therefore, than that you endeavour to  infuse into your works what you learn from the contemplation of the works  of others.  To recommend this has the appearance of needless and  superfluous advice, but it has fallen within my own knowledge that  artists, though they are not wanting in a sincere love for their art,  though they have great pleasure in seeing good pictures, and are well  skilled to distinguish what is excellent or defective in them, yet go on  in their own manner, without any endeavour to give a little of those  beauties which they admire in others, to their own works.  It is  difficult to conceive how the present Italian painters, who live in the  midst of the treasures of art, should be contented with their own style.  They proceed in their common-place inventions, and never think it worth  while to visit the works of those great artists with which they are  surrounded.    I remember several years ago to have conversed at Rome with an artist of  great fame throughout Europe; he was not without a considerable degree of  abilities, but those abilities were by no means equal to his own opinion  of them.  From the reputation he had acquired he too fondly concluded  that he stood in the same rank, when compared to his predecessors, as he  held with regard to his miserable contemporary rivals.    In conversation about some particulars of the works of Raffaelle, he  seemed to have, or to affect to have, a very obscure memory of them.  He  told me that he had not set his foot in the Vatican for fifteen years  together; that indeed he had been in treaty to copy a capital picture of  Raffaelle, but that the business had gone off; however, if the agreement  had held, his copy would have greatly exceeded the original.  The merit  of this artist, however great we may suppose it, I am sure would have  been far greater, and his presumption would have been far less if he had  visited the Vatican, as in reason he ought to have done, once at least  every month of his life.    I address myself, gentlemen, to you who have made some progress in the  art, and are to be for the future under the guidance of your own judgment  and discretion.    I consider you as arrived to that period when you have a right to think  for yourselves, and to presume that every man is fallible; to study the  masters with a suspicion that great men are not always exempt from great  faults; to criticise, compare, and rank their works in your own  estimation, as they approach to or recede from that standard of  perfection which you have formed in your own mind, but which those  masters themselves, it must be remembered, have taught you to make, and  which you will cease to make with correctness when you cease to study  them.  It is their excellences which have taught you their defects.    I would wish you to forget where you are, and who it is that speaks to  you.  I only direct you to higher models and better advisers.  We can  teach you here but very little; you are henceforth to be your own  teachers.  Do this justice, however, to the English Academy, to bear in  mind, that in this place you contracted no narrow habits, no false ideas,  nothing that could lead you to the imitation of any living master, who  may be the fashionable darling of the day.  As you have not been taught  to flatter us, do not learn to flatter yourselves.  We have endeavoured  to lead you to the admiration of nothing but what is truly admirable.  If  you choose inferior patterns, or if you make your own _former_ works,  your patterns for your _latter_, it is your own fault.    The purpose of this discourse, and, indeed, of most of my others, is to  caution you against that false opinion, but too prevalent amongst  artists, of the imaginary power of native genius, and its sufficiency in  great works.  This opinion, according to the temper of mind it meets  with, almost always produces, either a vain confidence, or a sluggish  despair, both equally fatal to all proficiency.    Study, therefore, the great works of the great masters for ever.  Study  as nearly as you can, in the order, in the manner, on the principles, on  which they studied.  Study nature attentively, but always with those  masters in your company; consider them as models which you are to  imitate, and at the same time as rivals which you are to combat.        A DISCOURSE  Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution of the  Prizes, December 10th, 1776, by the President.      Gentlemen,--It has been my uniform endeavour, since I first addressed you  from this place, to impress you strongly with one ruling idea.  I wished  you to be persuaded, that success in your art depends almost entirely on  your own industry; but the industry which I principally recommended, is  not the industry of the _hands_, but of the _mind_.    As our art is not a divine gift, so neither is it a mechanical trade.  Its  foundations are laid in solid science.  And practice, though essential to  perfection, can never attain that to which it aims, unless it works under  the direction of principle.    Some writers upon art carry this point too far, and suppose that such a  body of universal and profound learning is requisite, that the very  enumeration of its kind is enough to frighten a beginner.  Vitruvius,  after going through the many accomplishments of nature, and the many  acquirements of learning, necessary to an architect, proceeds with great  gravity to assert that he ought to be well skilled in the civil law, that  he may not be cheated in the title of the ground he builds on.    But without such exaggeration, we may go so far as to assert, that a  painter stands in need of more knowledge than is to be picked off his  pallet, or collected by looking on his model, whether it be in life or in  picture.  He can never be a great artist who is grossly illiterate.    Every man whose business is description ought to be tolerably conversant  with the poets in some language or other, that he may imbibe a poetical  spirit and enlarge his stock of ideas.  He ought to acquire a habit of  comparing and divesting his notions.  He ought not to be wholly  unacquainted with that part of philosophy which gives him an insight into  human nature, and relates to the manners, characters,"]]]
