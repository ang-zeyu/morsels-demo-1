Part of a cervical vertebra lay at the top of the skull, and  there were fragments of a few other bones.    The ulna of a child, broken off at the wrist, was near the doorway in  a mass of refuse in a ground-hog burrow. For several feet in every  direction around here the ashes were traversed by the tunnels and dens  of these animals, some of them extending down into the clay.    Twenty-five feet east of the doorway, a foot below the highest layer  of unbroken ashes, was the top and back of a thin skull.    Sixty feet from the front, 15 feet from the east wall, at a depth of  14 inches, was a partial skeleton, lying on the back. The right arm,  folded, lay by the side; the left forearm across the pelvis. All bones  from the atlas to the sacrum, except some bones of the hands and  wrists and the left ulna, lay in such position as to show they had  been interred with the flesh on, or at least while the cartilages  held them together; but no trace of the skull--which had lain toward  the west--or of any part of the legs or feet was present. Fragments of  coarse cloth were adhering to the pelvis. The bones, which were almost  like punk, were those of a young person, the caps of the long bones  being separate from the shafts; but they were of good size, the  humerus being 13 inches long. The left ulna (at least a left ulna) lay  above where the face should have been, but some inches away, with one  end near the surface. It is quite probable that ground hogs are  responsible for the condition of this skeleton, and that some of the  bones found scattered in the ashes belonged to it. About a foot under  the bones, but not connected with the burial in any way, were three  large pieces of a large pot.    Four feet east of this, a foot lower, was the skeleton of a baby, the  humerus only 31/2 inches long. The bones rolled out with some loose  ashes, and not all of them could be recovered.    Thirteen feet from the east wall, 16 feet from top of rear slope of  the ashes, 4 feet below the surface was part of a skeleton. The bones  lay on a damp, close-packed bed of ashes 6 inches thick. They were  closely folded, the femurs and lower leg bones being in contact; the  skull, scapulae, right humerus, sacrum, and some of the vertebrae were  missing. Such bones as remained were in their proper positions, except  that the sternum lay in the pelvis and the elbows at the knees. All of  them were in a space only 18 by 22 inches, measuring to the outermost  points. The situation of such bones as remained indicated that part of  a skeleton had been buried after the flesh had decayed, or had been  removed, but while the joints were still united, and covered with  loose ashes, whose settling had caused some sagging of the stratified  ashes, a foot in thickness, which lay above them, there being no  evidence that they had been disturbed since they were placed here. All  were as light as cork and, except the left tibia, which was 151/2 inches  long, fell to pieces when taken up.    Eight feet east from the last skeleton was one of a very young infant,  on left side, head toward the front of the cave. It was 21/2 feet below  the surface, partly under a jutting portion of a large rock whose top  was above the ashes. It lay on small angular rocks, with similar rocks  over it.    Two feet west of this was the ulna of a child 10 years old.    Sixteen feet from the east wall, 10 feet from top of rear slope, 2  feet under surface was another infant's skeleton, lying on the back,  head toward the mouth of the cave. The femur was only 41/2 inches long.    Fifteen feet from east wall, 8 feet from top of rear slope of ashes, a  little more than a foot below the surface, was the closely folded  skeleton of a woman between 20 and 25 years of age. It lay on the  right side, with the head east. The bones were in perfect condition,  even the coccyx being intact. All the teeth were present, solid, and  symmetrically set. Unbroken strata of ashes a foot thick above this  skeleton sagged somewhat owing to settling of loose ashes thrown  around and over the body at time of burial. The skull is shown, front,  profile, and back, in plate 21.    A few inches below these bones, with ashes intervening, were piled  some bones of a child of about 8 years. The caps of the joints were  not adherent, and some of the teeth had not come through the bone. The  skull, which was intact, lay on left side, vertex north, ribs, arm  bones, and feet bones lay on the top, at the back, and at the vertex,  in contact with the skull and with one another. As there was no  evidence that they had ever been disturbed by animals, it would appear  that only the bones mentioned had been deposited; even the lower jaw  was absent. They lay in a mass of kitchen refuse, shells, burned  bones, charcoal, and ashes, the upper layers of which were curved as  if the bones had been laid on a level area of this mixed material and  the rest of it piled over them. Their position, and the small number  of them, indicates that the flesh had been used as food. The skull is  shown in plate 22.    Between this partial skeleton and the complete one above it,  apparently thrown in with the refuse which covered and surrounded  both, were fragments of two large pelvic bones which did not belong to  either of them.    Directly below these burials, 3 feet under the surface, was part of an  infant's skeleton, with five shell disk beads among the bones; the  only instance in which ornaments were found with human bones. The  skull and some other bones were present, but most of the remains had  disappeared into the runway of a burrower.    At several places in the central parts of the cavern, at almost any  level between the top and the bottom of the ashes, were human bones,  singly or a few together, some of them apparently remains of  interments, others carried to the points where found. Most of these  scattered bones were of children or infants; but now and then larger  ones were found, notably two large adult tibiae which were a foot  apart. While a few of them may have been thrown in with the ashes,  most of this confusion resulted from the activity of rodents, though  some of it was due to desultory former investigations.    At one point was the perfect lower jaw of a child 8 or 10 years old;  with it were a scapula and some vertebrae which may have belonged to  it, also some ribs, vertebrae, and arm bones of an infant. Two or three  of them bore marks of fire, especially an ulna of a child which was  completely charred.    Four feet from east wall, 4 feet below surface, at the beginning of  the slope to the rear, was the skeleton of a child less than 2 years  old. It lay on left side, head east, legs bent, one arm folded with  hand by head, the other along the body; just such a position as would  be assumed by a sleeping infant. Some of the teeth were cut. All the  bones were in place, though soft and brittle; above them was an  unbroken stratum of ashes.    Four feet west of this, 2 feet higher, was the skeleton of a still  younger child.    Sixteen feet from east wall, at the beginning of slope to rear, near  the bottom of the ashes, was an adult's skeleton, extended on back,  head west. Three rocks, weighing from 75 to 300 pounds, were placed  over the body. Most of the bones had disappeared from decay; the  middle third of one tibia was much enlarged by disease, as shown in  plate 23.    Eleven feet east of this, 4 feet below surface, was an adult skeleton,  folded, on right side, head toward rear of the cave. The bones were  spongy and soft. Portions of the feet and legs, most of the pelvis,  the left arm, and some of the vertebrae were present, but there was no  trace of right arm, skull, or shoulders. A slab weighing 100 pounds or  more was set on edge just where the head should have been. One tibia,  the only bone with both ends remaining, measured 141/2 inches.    Near the wall, just beyond the break of the slope, was the entire  skeleton of a dog so old that its teeth were rounded and smooth. It  had been killed by a spear thrust entirely through its body, from the  right side, both scapulae being penetrated; the holes are three-fourths  of an inch in diameter. The skull of a fox was found near this, higher  in the ashes.    Fifteen feet from east wall, halfway down the slope, 18 inches under  surface, was the skeleton of an infant only a few days old. No trace  of pelvis or right leg remained, though all the other bones were well  preserved.    Twenty-four feet from east wall, at beginning of rear slope, was the  complete skeleton of a young child, extended, on back, head toward  rear of cave. The bones showed evidence of disease, as may be seen in  plate 23. The skull is shown in plate 24.    Nineteen feet from east wall, 13 feet from foot of slope, was a hole  41/2 inches to 5 inches in diameter, 21 inches deep, extending into the  loose dark earth underlying the ashes. The bottom of the hole was  muddy, being at about the level of the standing water, and contained  charred and decayed remains of oak wood. Ashes, in layers having the  same slope as the surface, extended over it, proving the post (?) to  have been burned some time before the cave was abandoned.

EXTRACT FROM REPORT ON HOSPITALS AND CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS OF THE  COLONY, 1888, BY THE LATE DR. MACGREGOR, INSPECTOR-GENERAL.      Many causes have conspired in our history as a colony to intensify the  good-nature of our people--at any rate, so far as extravagance in  vicarious charity is concerned. Our sensitiveness to suffering has been  greatly stimulated by the comparative absence from our towns of those  sights of misery and squalor that deaden the feelings by familiarity;  and the lavish life we have led since 1870 has made us free-handed to  the poor and impatient of the trouble required to find out whether our  charity was wisely or mischievously given.    During our years of plenty, when borrowed money was being largely spent,  and the prices of wool, &c., were high, I was in charge of the Dunedin  Asylum, and remember with what forebodings I regarded the quality of the  immigrants that were being poured into the country after the despatch of  instructions in October, 1873, to the Agent-General \"To grant free  passages, and also, if necessary, advance expenses to port of  embarkation and outfit.\"    Twenty thousand immigrants were, if possible, to be sent out in six  months. With wonderful rapidity the results became apparent. From all  parts came reports of the evil quality of the immigrants. The  Immigration Minister, writing to the Agent-General in June, 1874, says:  \"I have already called your attention to the fact that the shipment by  the ... included a number of girls out of the Cork Workhouse, and I took  the opportunity of remarking on the very undesirable character of such  immigration. A perusal of the report of the Immigration Officer at  Dunedin will, I think, convince you how very disastrous it is likely to  prove to the cause of immigration if such modes of selection as those  adopted by Mrs. ---- (who was paid per emigrant) are under any  circumstances permitted. The result in the colony of the landing and  distribution of such women as these complained of, and of such  immigrants as the \"young men\" whom Mr. Allen states he has ascertained  to be professed thieves, and one of them a ticket-of-leave man, is  naturally a feeling of indignation and dismay.\"    No doubt this was an extreme case, but, nevertheless, it is plain that,  what with the great influx of a low class of navvies during the height  of our public works, and the vicious and degenerate people, of whom so  many were introduced at this time, the average of our population in  point of quality was considerably deteriorated. My experience as Medical  Officer of our largest asylum for so many years has convinced me that  the ultimate cost of this degraded class of people to this country is  enormous.

They fill our gaols,  our hospitals, and our asylums, and, like a swarm of low parasitical  organisms, they have, to an extent that is almost incredible, absorbed  the outdoor relief that was meant for the self-supporting and struggling  poor. I am sure that by far the largest proportion of the aid that has  been so abundantly distributed by the various charitable agencies,  especially in our large towns, has been spent in supporting a great many  idle and vicious persons whose example has had the most pernicious  effect in pauperizing the people. It should never be forgotten that the  evil caused by the introduction of this class is never finished. The  impaired health, low morality, and insanity descend to the offspring,  and are a continual drain upon the community.          THE HEALTH OF SCHOOL-CHILDREN.    EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF SCHOOL  HYGIENE, 1924.      The fundamental necessities of healthy growth are simple, and it is  doubtful if there is any country in the world to-day where they are more  universally procurable. Fresh air, sunlight, food of the right type and  amount, adequate sleep and rest, wholesome exercise, are available for  all but that small section of the people already mentioned. Sir  Frederick Mott, in an address recently published in the _British Medical  Journal_, quotes Voltaire: \"Regime in diet is better than medicine. Eat  moderately what you know by experience you can digest, for that which  you can digest only is good for the body. What is the medicine that  makes you digest? Exercise. What will repair your energy? Sleep.\"    To this text he adds the benefits of sunlight and pure air.    Reports from School Medical Officers continue to record that tea, white  bread, and meat play the chief part in the dietary of many homes. Fresh  fruit and vegetables, even in rural areas, are not eaten sufficiently.    Frequent eating between meals takes away appetite and retards digestion.  Many children bring to school substantial \"play-lunches\" to be consumed  at the mid-morning interval. Others consume large quantities of sweets.  Healthy hunger they rarely know. A noteworthy fact is that in New  Zealand the consumption of sugar per head per annum is 117 lb., as  against rather more than half that quantity in Britain and much less in  other countries. Apart from its directly deleterious influence on the  teeth, the alteration of food values in the dietary necessitated by the  inclusion of so much sugar results in digestive troubles and disturbed  nutrition. In this country, with its many sources of supply, eggs, milk,  cheese, butter, fresh fruit, and vegetables should be available in  sufficient abundance and at low-enough prices to displace to a greater  extent the meat that is such a prominent article of diet in many  households.    The value of rest, both physical and mental, for children is not  adequately recognized. In the country many children work early and late  at farm-work, as milking, &c., and in the city children earn money as  newsboys, message-boys, &c. Where the family exchequer needs to be  augmented in this way excuse must be made, but in many comfortable homes  children do not rest sufficiently. Mr. Cyril Burt, psychologist for the  London City Council, was recently reported as deploring the tendency in  modern education to attach undue value to the dramatic and theatrical.  Children who possess talent are made to drag it prematurely into the  light of publicity. They are over-trained and over-stimulated. Nearly  all children are taught to regard frequent amusement as essential to  happiness. To leave them to develop their own resources and allow them  to find interest in simple and natural things would be to extend widely  their chance of future happiness.    It is the wrongly fed, insufficiently rested child that most readily  develops physical deformity. The fatigued nervous system is expressed in  general bodily slackness. There is deficient muscular and ligamentous  tone. The typical faulty posture is thus acquired, with drooping head,  flat chest, wing shoulders, prominent abdomen. Vitality is depressed and  the bodily mechanism out of gear. The grosser bony deformities so often  found in older lands associated with rickets are rarely seen in New  Zealand, but less evident manifestations of faulty diet and regime are  frequent. It is fortunate that in this country we cannot altogether  escape, however we seek our pleasures in stuffy rooms or dark,  ill-ventilated places of entertainment, those powerful and beneficial  agents for promoting healthy growth--sunlight and fresh air. For the  prevention of defect it is essential that the classroom should offer  hygienic conditions--_e.g._, good lighting and ventilation, suitable  furniture, &c. Another contributory factor in poor physical development  is the use of incorrect clothing "]]]
