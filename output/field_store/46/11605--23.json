There sat the ducks by the running water and rested  themselves, and plumed themselves with their flat bills, and held a  comfortable chat. The servant stayed where he was and listened to them.  They told how they had waddled about all yesterday morning and found  good food; and then one of them said pitifully,    \"Something lies very heavy in my craw,--it is the ring that was lying  under the Queen's window; I swallowed it down in too great a hurry.\"    Then the servant seized her by the neck, took her into the kitchen, and  said to the cook,    \"Kill this one, she is quite ready for cooking.\"    \"Yes,\" said the cook, weighing it in her hand; \"there will be no trouble  of fattening this one--it has been ready ever so long.\"    She then slit up its neck, and when it was opened the Queen's ring was  found in its craw. The servant could now clearly prove his innocence,  and in order to make up for the injustice he had suffered the King  permitted him to ask some favour for himself, and also promised him the  place of greatest honour in the royal household.    But the servant refused it, and only asked for a horse and money for  travelling, for he had a fancy to see the world, and look about him a  little. So his request was granted, and he set out on his way; and one  day he came to a pool of water, by which he saw three fishes who had got  entangled in the rushes, and were panting for water. Although fishes are  usually considered dumb creatures, he understood very well their lament  that they were to perish so miserably; and as he had a compassionate  heart he dismounted from his horse, and put the three fishes back again  into the water. They quivered all over with joy, stretched out their  heads, and called out to him,    \"We will remember and reward thee, because thou hast delivered us.\" He  rode on, and after a while he heard a small voice come up from the sand  underneath his horse's feet. He listened, and understood how an ant-king  was complaining,    \"If only these men would keep off, with their great awkward beasts! here  comes this stupid horse treading down my people with his hard hoofs!\"    The man then turned his horse to the side-path, and the ant-king called  out to him,    \"We will remember and reward thee!\"    The path led him through a wood, and there he saw a father-raven and  mother-raven standing by their nest and throwing their young ones out.    \"Off with you! young gallows-birds!\" cried they; \"we cannot stuff you  any more; you are big enough to fend for yourselves!\" The poor young  ravens lay on the ground, fluttering, and beating the air with their  pinions, and crying,    \"We are poor helpless things, we cannot fend for ourselves, we cannot  even fly! we can only die of hunger!\"    Then the kind young man dismounted, killed his horse with his dagger,  and left it to the young ravens for food. They came hopping up, feasted  away at it, and cried,    \"We will remember and reward thee!\"    So now he had to use his own legs, and when he had gone a long way he  came to a great town. There was much noise and thronging in the streets,  and there came a man on a horse, who proclaimed,    \"That the King's daughter seeks a husband, but he who wishes to marry  her must perform a difficult task, and if he cannot carry it through  successfully, he must lose his life.\"    Many had already tried, but had lost their lives, in vain. The young  man, when he saw the King's daughter, was so dazzled by her great  beauty, that he forgot all danger, went to the King and offered himself  as a wooer.    Then he was led to the sea-side, and a gold ring was thrown into the  water before his eyes. Then the King told him that he must fetch the  ring up again from the bottom of the sea, saying,    \"If you come back without it, you shall be put under the waves again and  again until you are drowned.\"    Every one pitied the handsome young man, but they went, and left him  alone by the sea. As he was standing on the shore and thinking of what  he should do, there came three fishes swimming by, none other than those  he had set free. The middle one had a mussel in his mouth, and he laid  it on the strand at the young man's feet; and when he took it up and  opened it there was the gold ring inside! Full of joy he carried it to  the King, and expected the promised reward; but the King's daughter,  proud of her high birth, despised him, and set him another task to  perform. She went out into the garden, and strewed about over the grass  ten sacks full of millet seed.    \"By the time the sun rises in the morning you must have picked up all  these,\" she said, \"and not a grain must be wanting.\"    The young man sat down in the garden and considered how it was possible  to do this task, but he could contrive nothing, and stayed there,  feeling very sorrowful, and expecting to be led to death at break of  day. But when the first beams of the sun fell on the garden he saw that  the ten sacks were all filled, standing one by the other, and not even a  grain was missing. The ant-king had arrived in the night with his  thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had picked up all the  millet seed, and filled the sacks with great industry. The King's  daughter came herself into the garden and saw with astonishment that the  young man had performed all that had been given him to do. But she could  not let her proud heart melt, but said,    \"Although he has completed the two tasks, he shall not be my bridegroom  unless he brings me an apple from the tree of life.\"    The young man did not know where the tree of life was to be found, but  he set out and went on and on, as long as his legs could carry him, but  he had no hope of finding it. When he had gone through three kingdoms he  came one evening to a wood, and seated himself under a tree to go to  sleep; but he heard a rustling in the boughs, and a golden apple fell  into his hand. Immediately three ravens flew towards him, perched on his  knee, and said,    \"We are the three young ravens that you delivered from starving; when we  grew big, and heard that you were seeking the golden apple, we flew  over the sea to the end of the earth, where the tree of life stands, and  we fetched the apple.\"    Full of joy the young man set off on his way home, and brought the  golden apple to the King's beautiful daughter, who was without any  further excuse.    So they divided the apple of life, and ate it together; and their hearts  were filled with love, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a  great age.          The STRAW, The COAL, and the BEAN      THERE lived in a certain village a poor old woman who had collected a  mess of beans, and was going to cook them. So she made a fire on her  hearth, and, in order to make it burn better, she put in a handful of  straw. When the beans began to bubble in the pot, one of them fell out  and lay, never noticed, near a straw which was already there; soon a  red-hot coal jumped out of the fire and joined the pair. The straw began  first, and said,    \"Dear friends, how do you come here?\" The coal answered,    \"I jumped out of the fire by great good luck, or I should certainly have  met with my death. I should have been burned to ashes.\" The bean said,    \"I too have come out of it with a whole skin, but if the old woman had  kept me in the pot I should have been cooked into a soft mass like my  comrades.\"    \"Nor should I have met with a better fate,\" said the straw; \"the old  woman has turned my brothers into fire and smoke, sixty of them she took  up at once and deprived of life. Very luckily I managed to slip through  her fingers.\"    \"What had we better do now?\" said the coal.    \"I think,\" answered the bean, \"that as we have been so lucky as to  escape with our lives, we will join in good fellowship together, and,  lest any more bad fortune should happen to us here, we will go abroad  into foreign lands.\"    The proposal pleased the two others, and forthwith they started on their  travels. Soon they came to a little brook, and as there was no  stepping-stone, and no bridge, they could not tell how they were to get  to the other side. The straw was struck with a good idea, and said,    \"I will lay myself across, so that you can go over me as if I were a  bridge!\"    So the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other, and the coal,  who was of an ardent nature, quickly trotted up to go over the new-made  bridge. When, however, she reached the middle, and heard the water  rushing past beneath her, she was struck with terror, and stopped, and  could get no farther. So the straw began to get burnt, broke in two  pieces, and fell in the brook, and the coal slipped down, hissing as she  touched the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean, who had prudently  remained behind on the bank, could not help laughing at the sight, and  not being able to contain herself, went on laughing so excessively that  she burst. And now would she certainly have been undone for ever, if a  tailor on his travels had not by good luck stopped to rest himself by  the brook. As he had a compassionate heart, he took out needle and  thread and stitched her together again. The bean thanked him in the most  elegant manner, but as he had sewn her up with black stitches, all beans  since then have a black seam.          The FISHERMAN and his WIFE      THERE was once a fisherman and his wife who lived together in a hovel by  the sea-shore, and the fisherman went out every day with his hook and  line to catch fish, and he angled and angled.    One day he was sitting with his rod and looking into the clear water,  and he sat and sat.    At last down went the line to the bottom of the water, and when he drew  it up he found a great flounder on the hook. And the flounder said to  him,    \"Fisherman, listen to me; let me go, I am not a real fish but an  enchanted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#18)"],[1,"tart. You can claim victim compensation, you  know.\"    Vye was silent, but Hume did not let him remain so.    \"When the Patrol arrives, you put in your claim. I'll back you.\"    \"You can't.\"    \"That's where you're mistaken,\" Hume told him crisply. \"I've already  taped a full story back at the spacer--it's on record now.\"    Vye frowned. The Hunter seemed determined to ask for the worst the  Patrol--or the planet police back on Nahuatl--could deal out. A case  of illegal conditioning was about as serious as you could get.    They shot along the diagonal of the triangle made by three points, the  mountain valley, Wass' camp, and the safari headquarters, heading to  the slopes up which the men must be herded if the beasts were  shepherding them to the mountain valley. Vye, surveying the forest  thick below, began to doubt they would ever be able to pick them up  before they reached the valley gate.    Hume took a weaving course, zigzagging back and forth, while they both  watched intently for a glint from one of the globes, any movement  which would betray that trail. And it was on one of the upper slopes  that the flitter passed over two of the blue beasts lumbering along.  Neither of the creatures paid any attention to the flyer, they moved  with purpose on some mission of their own.    \"Maybe the tail end of the hunting pack,\" Hume commented.    He sent the flyer hovering over a stunted line of trees and brush.  Beyond that was bare rock. But though they hung for moments, nothing  moved into that open.    \"Wrong scent somehow.\" Hume brought the flitter around. He had it on  manual control now, keeping it answering to the quick changes of his  will.    A longer sweep supplied the answer--a vegetation roofed slit running  back into the uplands, in a way resembling the crevice through which  they had originally found their way into this country. Hume brought  the flyer along that. But if the men they sought were pushing their  way through below they could not be sighted from the air. At last,  with evening drawing in, Hume was forced to admit failure.    \"Wait by the gap?\" Vye asked.    \"Have to now.\" Hume glanced about. \"I'd say maybe  tomorrow--mid-morning before they make it that far--_if_ they are  here. We'll have plenty of time.\"    Time for what? To make ready for a pitched battle with Wass--or with  the beasts herding him? To try in the space of hours to solve the  mystery of the lake?    \"Do you think we could blast that thing in the lake?\" Vye asked.    \"We might be able to, just might. But that must be the last resort. We  want that in working order for the X-Tee men to study. No, we'd better  plan to hold Wass at the gate, wait for the Patrol to come in.\"    Less than an hour later after a soaring approach, Hume brought the  flitter down with neat skill on the top of one of the cliffs which  helped to form the portal of the gap. There was no difference in the  scene below, save that where the two bodies of the blue beasts had  lain there were now only clean and shining bones.    Darkness spread out from the lake woods like a growing stain of evil  promise as the sun fell behind the peaks. Night came earlier here than  in the plains.    \"Watch!\" Vye had been gazing down the gap; he was the first to note  that movement in the cloaking bush.    Out of the cover trotted a four-footed, antlered animal he had not  seen before.    \"Syken deer,\" Hume identified. \"But why in the mountains? It's a long  way from its home range.\"    The deer did not pause, but headed directly for the gap and, as it  neared, Vye saw that its brown coat was roughed with patches of white  froth, while more dripped from the pale pink tongue protruding from  its open jaws, and its shrunken sides heaved.    \"Driven!\" Hume picked up a stone, hurled it to strike the ground ahead  of the deer.    The creature did not start, nor show any sign of seeing the rock fall.  It trotted on at the same wearied pace, passed the portal rocks into  the valley. Then it stood still, wedge-shaped head up, black horns  displayed, while the nose flaps expanded, testing the air, until it  bounded toward the lake, disappearing in the woods.    Though they shared watches during the night there were no other signs  of life, nor did the deer reappear from the woods. With the  mid-morning there was a sudden sound to warn them--a wild cry which  must have come from a human throat. Hume tossed one of the needlers to  Vye, took the other, and they scrambled down to the floor of the gap  passage.    Wass did not lead his men, he came behind the reeling trio as if he  had joined the blasts as driver. And while his men wavered, staggered,  gave the appearance of nearly complete exhaustion, he still walked  with a steady tread, in command of his wits, his fears, and the  company.    As the first of the men blundered on, a fresh trickle of red running  down his bruised face, Hume called:    \"Wass!\"    The Veep stopped short. He made no move to unsling the needler he  carried, its barrel pointing skyward over his shoulder, but his round  head with its upstanding comb of hair swung slightly from side to  side.    \"Stop--Wass--this is a trap!\"    His three men kept on. Vye moved, for Peake leading that wavering  group, stumbled, would have fallen had not the younger man advanced  from the shadows to steady him.    \"Vye!\" Hume made his name a warning.    He had only time to glance around. Wass, his broad face impassive  except for the eyes--those burning madman's eyes--was aiming a ray  tube.    Broken free of his hold, Peake fell to the right, came up against  Hume. As Vye went down he saw Wass dart forward at a speed he wouldn't  have believed a driven man could summon. The Veep lunged, escaping the  shot the Hunter had no time to aim, rolled, and came up with the  needler Vye had dropped.    Then Hume, hampered by Peake's feeble clawing, met head on the  swinging barrel of that weapon. He gave a startled grunt and smashed  back against the cliff, a wave of scarlet blood streaming down the  side of his head.    The momentum of Wass' charge carried him on. He collided with his men,  and the last thing Vye saw, was the huddle of all four of them,  flailing arms and legs, spinning on through the gate into the valley  with Wass' hoarse, wordless shouting, bringing echoes from the cliffs.          13      He lay against a rock, and it was quiet again, except for a small  whimpering sound which hurt, joined with the eating pain in his side.  Vye turned his head, smelled burned cloth and flesh. Cautiously he  tried to move, bring his hand across his body to the belt at his  waist. One small part of his mind was very clear--if he could get his  fingers to the packet there, and the contents of that packet to his  mouth, the pain would go away, and maybe he could slip back into the  darkness again.    Somehow he did it, pulled the packet out of its container pouch,  worked the fingers of his one usable hand until he shredded open the  end of the covering. The tablets inside, spilled out. But he had three  or four of them in his grasp. Laboriously he brought his hand up,  mouthed them all together, chewing their bitterness, swallowing them  as best he could without water.    Water--the lake! For a moment he was back in time, feeling for the  water bulbs he should be carrying. Then the incautious movement of his  questing fingers brought a sudden stab of raw, red agony and he  moaned.    The tablets worked. But he did not slide back into unconsciousness  again as the throbbing torture became something remote and  untroubling. With his good arm he braced himself against the cliff,  managed to sit up.    Sun flashed on the metal barrel of a needler which lay in the trampled  dust between him and another figure, still very still, with a pool of  blood about the head. Vye waited for a steadying breath or two, then  started the infinitely long journey of several feet which separated  him from Hume.    He was panting heavily when he crawled close enough to touch the  Hunter. Hume's face, cheek down in the now sodden dust, was dabbled  with congealing blood. As Vye turned the hunter's head, it rolled  limply. The other side was a mass of blood and dust, too thick to  afford Vye any idea of how serious a hurt Hume had taken. But he was  still alive.    With his good hand Vye thrust his numb and useless left one into the  front of his belt. Then, awkwardly he tried to tend Hume. After a  close inspection he thought that the mass of blood had come from a  ragged tear in the scalp above the temple and the bone beneath had  escaped damage. From Hume's own first-aid pack he crushed tablets into  the other's slack mouth, hoping they would dissolve if the Hunter  could not swallow. Then he relaxed against the cliff to wait--for what  he could not have said.    Wass' party had gone on into the valley. When Vye turned his head to  look down the slope he could see nothing of them. They must have tried  to push on to the lake. The flitter was at the top of the cliff, as  far out of his reach now as if it were in planetary orbit. There was  only the hope that a rescue party from the safari camp might come.  Hume had set the directional beam on the flyer, when he had brought  her down, to serve as a beacon for the Patrol, if and when Starns was  lucky enough to contact a cruiser.    \"Hmmm....\" Hume's mouth moved, cracked the drying bloody mask on his  lips and chin. His eyes blinked open and he lay staring up at the sky.    \"Hume--\" Vye was startled at the sound of his own voice, so thready  and weak, and by the fact that he found it difficult to speak at all.    The other's head turned; now the eyes were on him and there was a  spark of awareness in them.    \"Wass?\" The whisper was as strained as his own had been.    \"In there.\" Vye's hand lifted from Hume's chest indicating the  valley.    \"Not good.\" Hume blinked again. \"How bad?\" His attention was not for  his own hurt; his eyes searched Vye."]]]
