The rule of Lenine and Trotzky promised to be even more  tyrannical than anything that had preceded it in Russia.    [Illustration: EUROPEAN BATTLE FRONTS End of 1917]    Meanwhile the Bolsheviki had arranged for an armistice with Germany with  a view toward immediate negotiations for peace. This arrangement for the  cessation of military operations became effective December 7. In spite  of its provisions, however, the Germans, who had taken Riga (ree'ga) in  September, continued their advance into Russian territory. By the close  of 1917 peace negotiations were in progress between Russia and her  enemies. Russia under Bolshevik control had definitely deserted her  allies.    THE BRITISH IN MESOPOTAMIA.--It will be remembered that the Allied war  plans in 1916 had included the junction of Russian armies operating from  the Caucasus with British troops advancing north from the Persian Gulf.  After the disaster at Kut-el-Amara the British still held the territory  about the mouth of the Tigris. In January, 1917, they began a new  advance up the river in the direction of Bagdad. This time their efforts  proved successful. In February, Kut-el-Amara was retaken from the Turks,  and on March 11 the British entered the city of Bagdad. They also  continued their advance a considerable distance along the Bagdad Railway  and occupied much of the Euphrates valley.    Still more important victories would probably have resulted from this  campaign had it not been for the outbreak of the Russian revolution.  This had the effect of weakening Russian military cooeperation, and  finally of removing Russia entirely from the war, leaving to Great  Britain alone the task of dealing with the Turkish armies in Asia. But  the British kept their hold on the city of Bagdad, thus checkmating the  German scheme of a Berlin-Bagdad railway and protecting India from any  offensive on this side.    THE PALESTINE CAMPAIGN.--The year 1917 witnessed still another  military success for the British in Asia. The Turks had made several  attempts to seize the Suez Canal and so inflict a serious blow against  the communications of the Allies with the Far East. To remove, if  possible, the danger of further threats against this vital spot, the  English at last decided upon an offensive in that region. Early in 1917,  the British advance began. During January and February important  positions on the Sinai peninsula were seized. This success was followed  by a slow progress north into Palestine. The resistance of the Turks was  powerful and the British met with serious reverses. The terrible heat of  the summer months further held up their operations. In the fall,  however, the advance was resumed and a number of towns in the Holy Land  fell into the hands of the British. In November, Jaffa, the seaport of  Jerusalem, was taken. All the Turkish positions around the Holy City  were carried by storm, and on December 10 Jerusalem surrendered to  General Allenby.    This successful campaign in Palestine had several important results. The  capture of Jerusalem after almost seven centuries of Turkish control led  to general rejoicing among the Allied nations. Large numbers of Jews  throughout the world, who had long looked forward to the reestablishment  of a Jewish nation in Palestine, now felt that a long step had been  taken toward the realization of their hopes. From a military point of  view, however, the chief result of the British campaign in Palestine was  that it definitely freed the Suez Canal from further danger of a Turkish  attack.    THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST ITALY.--At the beginning of 1917 the Italian  forces were within eleven miles of their great objective, the city and  port of Trieste. During the late spring and summer the advance  continued. Austrian trenches were occupied and tens of thousands of  Austrian soldiers were captured. After two years of effort it seemed  that the Italians would obtain the city and incorporate its  population--very largely Italian--into the kingdom of Italy. But  conditions in Austria and Germany had greatly changed. The cessation of  war by Russia relieved the Central Powers of the necessity of keeping  large armies on the eastern front. Further, the campaign had been going  against Germany on the western front, and an easy victory in Italy might  quiet criticism at home.    An immense army of Austrians and Germans was gathered together to attack  the Italian forces. The Italians were spread out in a semicircle about  one hundred and fifty miles long stretching from near Trent to within a  few miles of Trieste. The Austrians controlled the upper passes in the  mountains, so that they could attack this long line where they would.  Thus the Italian military position was difficult to defend. The campaign  began with a surprise attack by picked German troops at a point where  the morale of one Italian division had previously been weakened by the  pretended fraternizing of Austrian troops.    The Austro-German drive (October-December, 1917) swiftly undid the work  of two years of most arduous endeavor. The Italians were forced back  from Gorizia and compelled to surrender mountain positions which had  been captured by them at enormous cost. Back across the boundary they  retreated, losing heavily in men and material. The enemy advanced into  the low country near Venice, and it seemed for a time that the city  would fall into their hands. But British and French assistance was sent  to Italy, the Italian army recovered its spirit, and a permanent check  was put to the enemy's advance before Venice was reached. Upon a much  shorter but more defensible line the Italians held the enemy at bay in  the mountains and along the river Piave (pyah'v[=a]).    [Illustration: WAR ZONES]    UNRESTRICTED SUBMARINE WARFARE.--On January 31, 1917, the German  ambassador to the United States, Count von Bernstorff, announced to  President Wilson that Germany would begin unrestricted submarine warfare  the following day, in the waters around Great Britain and France,[4]  thus withdrawing the pledge given as a result of the sinking of the  \"Sussex.\" Three days later the President handed Count von Bernstorff his  passports and recalled Ambassador Gerard' from Berlin, thus severing  diplomatic relations with Germany.    During the next six months shipping was sunk at an average rate of  600,000 tons per month, three times as fast as before, and two or three  times faster than it was being replaced. The highwater mark was reached  in April, when 800,000 tons of shipping were destroyed. Unless this loss  could be greatly reduced the Allies for want of food and materials would  soon have to give up fighting.    But methods were quickly devised to combat the new danger. The patrols  were increased, ships voyaged under convoy of fast destroyers constantly  hovering about on the watch for submarines, and other protective  measures were taken, so that the submarine menace was soon much reduced.  By September, 1918, the sinkings were only about 150,000 tons a month,  while the production of ships, especially in the United States, has  increased to several times this amount.    Apparently Germany had waited until she had built a large number of  submarines, thinking that by the use of a great fleet of them in a  ruthless warfare on shipping she could force a peace within a few  months. In this expectation she was disappointed. The principal result  of the withdrawal of her pledge to this country was the entrance of the  United States into the war on the side of the Allies. Captain Persius,  an expert German naval critic, admitted in November, 1917, that the  German admiralty was grossly mistaken in its calculations and that  Germany had no reason for believing in the decisive influence of the  submarine war.    THE UNITED STATES DRIFTS TOWARD WAR.--The breaking off of diplomatic  relations is not a declaration of war. Nevertheless the events  immediately succeeding the withdrawal of Count von Bernstorff made a  declaration of war increasingly probable. The most important of these  were the publication of the Zimmerman note, the fact that several  American merchant ships were actually sunk by German submarines, and the  discovery that members of the German embassy and other German diplomatic  representatives had been concerned in plotting on United States soil  against the Allies, thus endangering our peaceful relations with them.  Not only so, but there was evidence that plots had been laid to destroy  American lives and property in this country and to stir up internal  disorders, such as strikes and riots.    THE ZIMMERMAN NOTE.--On the last day of February, the Secretary of  State published a note that had come into his possession which was  addressed by Dr. Zimmerman, the German foreign minister, to the German  minister in Mexico. The note stated that Germany would soon begin a  ruthless submarine warfare and proposed, if the United States should  declare war on Germany, that Mexico should enter into an alliance with  Germany. Germany was to furnish money and Mexico was to reconquer New  Mexico, Texas, and Arizona. It was also hinted that Mexico should  suggest to Japan that the latter country should come into the agreement.  The interesting thing about the note is that it was dated January 19,  twelve days before Germany announced to us her plan for ruthless  submarine warfare, and during a time when our relations with Germany,  though under a great strain, were still peaceable.    ARMED NEUTRALITY.--About the time the Zimmerman note was published,  President Wilson asked Congress to authorize the arming of American  merchant ships for their own defense. A small minority in Congress by  their obstructive tactics prevented the passage of the desired  resolution before Congress expired on March 4. On March"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#18)"],[1,"of the world would  visit him, and instead of representing a mere provincial school of  thought, he would then be a true metropolitan for all schools and all  nations.    The Arabian element in Islam would certainly support such a nomination,  and it must be remembered that Arabia extends from Marocco to Bushire;  and so would the Indian and the Malay--indeed every element but the  Turkish, which is day by day becoming of less importance. I have even  heard it affirmed that a Caliphate of the Koreysh at Mecca would go far  towards reconciling the Schismatics, Abadhites, and Shiahs with  orthodoxy; and I have reason to believe that it would so affect the  liberal three-quarters of Wahhabism. To the Shiahs, especially, a  descendant of Ali could not but be acceptable; and to the Arabs of Oman  and Yemen a Caliph of the Koreysh would be at least less repugnant than  a Caliph of the Beni Othman. There certainly have of late years been  symptoms of less bitterness between these schismatics and their old  enemies, the Sunites; and such a change in the conditions of the  Caliphate might conceivably bring about a full reconciliation of all  parties. Mussulmans can no longer afford to fight each other as of old;  and I know that a reunion of the sects is already an idea with advanced  thinkers. Lastly, the Caliphate would in Arabia be freed from the  incubus of Turkish scholasticism and the stigma of Turkish immorality,  and would have freer scope for what Islam most of all requires, a moral  reformation.    It is surely not beyond the flight of sane imagination to suppose, in  the last overwhelming catastrophe of Constantinople, a council of Ulema  assembling at Mecca, and according to the legal precedent of ancient  days electing a Caliph. The assembly would, without doubt, witness  intrigues of princes and quarrels among schoolmen and appeals to  fanaticism and accusations of infidelity. Money, too, would certainly  play its part there as elsewhere, and perhaps blood might be shed. But  any one who remembers the history of the Christian Church in the  fifteenth century, and the synods which preceded the Council of Basle,  must admit that such accompaniments of intrigue and corruption are no  bar to a legal solution of religious difficulties. It was above all else  the rivalries of Popes and Anti-popes that precipitated the Catholic  Reformation.    FOOTNOTES:    [14] According to Canon Law the Caliph cannot cede any portion of the  lands of Islam except on physical compulsion.    [15] This too was written before the events of September, 1881. These  have immensely added to the chance of Cairo's becoming once more the  seat of the Caliphate, though not perhaps of Mohammed Towfik's being the  Caliph elected.          CHAPTER IV.    A MOHAMMEDAN REFORMATION.      It is with considerable doubt of my ability to do justice to so very  difficult a subject that I now approach the most important point of all  in this inquiry, namely, the question on which in reality every other  depends: \"Is there a possibility of anything like general reform for  Islam in her political and moral life?\"    It is obvious that, unless we can answer this in the affirmative, none  of the changes I have been prefiguring will very much affect her  ultimate fortunes--neither the solution of her legal deadlock with the  Ottoman Caliphate, nor the transfer of her metropolis to a new centre,  nor even the triumph of her arms, if such were possible, in Africa or  India. These by themselves could, at best, only delay her decline. They  might even precipitate her ruin. Islam, if she relies only on the sword,  must in the end perish by it, for her forces, vast as they are, are  without physical cohesion, being scattered widely over the surface of  three continents and divided by insuperable accidents of seas and  deserts; and the enemy she would have to face is intelligent as well as  strong, and would not let her rest. Already what is called the \"Progress  of the World\" envelopes her with its ships and its commerce, and, above  all, with its printed thought, which she is beginning to read. Nor is it  likely in the future to affect her less. Every year as it goes by  carries her farther from the possibility of isolation, and forces on her  new acquaintances, not only her old foes, the Frank and Muscovite, but  the German, the Chinaman, and the American, with all of whom she may  have in turn to count. If she would not be strangled by these influences  she must use other arms than those of the flesh, and meet the  intellectual invasion of her frontiers with a corresponding  intelligence. Otherwise she has nothing to look forward to but a gradual  decay, spiritual as well as political. Her law must become little by  little a dead letter, her Caliphate an obsolete survival, and her creed  a mere opinion. Islam as a living and controlling moral force in the  world would then gradually cease.    In expressing my conviction that Islam is not thus destined yet awhile  to perish I believe that I am running counter to much high authority  among my countrymen. I know that it is a received opinion with those  best qualified to instruct the public that Islam is in its constitution  unamenable to change, and by consequence to progressive life, or even,  in the face of hostile elements, to prolonged life at all. Students of  the Sheriat have not inaptly compared the Koranic law to a dead man's  hand, rigid and cold, and only to be loosened when the hand itself shall  have been cut away. It has been asserted that the first rule of  Mohammedan thought has been that change was inadmissible, and  development of religious practice, either to right or left of the narrow  path of mediaeval scholasticism, absolutely precluded. I know this, and I  know, too, that a vast array of learned Mohammedan opinion can be cited  to prove this to be the case, and that very few of the modern Ulema of  any school of divinity would venture openly to impugn its truth. Nor  have I forgotten the repeated failure of attempts made in Turkey within  the last fifty years to gain religious assent to the various legal  innovations decreed by Sultan after Sultan in deference to the will of  Europe, nor the fate which has sometimes overtaken those who were the  advocates of change. I know, according to all rule written and spoken by  the orthodox, that Islam cannot move, and yet in spite of it I answer  with some confidence in the fashion of Galileo, \"E pur si muove.\"    The fact is, Islam does move. A vast change has come upon Mohammedan  thought since its last legal Mujtahed wrote his last legal opinion; and  what was true of orthodox Islam fifty and even twenty years ago is no  longer true now. When Urquhart, the first exponent of Mohammedanism to  Englishmen, began his writing, the Hanefite teaching of Constantinople  had not begun to be questioned, and he was perfectly justified in citing  it as the only rule recognized by the mass of the orthodox. No such  thing as a liberal religious party then existed anywhere, and those who  broke the law in the name of political reform were breakers of the law  and nothing more. Every good man was their enemy, and if any spoke of  liberty he was understood as meaning licence. It was not even conceived  then that the Sheriat might be legally remodelled. Now, however, and  especially within the last ten years, a large section of godly and  legal-minded men have ranged themselves on the side of liberal opinion,  and serious attempts have been made to reconcile a desire of improvement  with unabated loyalty to Islam.    A true liberal party has thus been formed, which includes in its ranks  not merely political intriguers of the type familiar to Europe in Midhat  Pasha, but men of sincere piety, who would introduce moral as well as  political reforms into the practice of Mohammedans. These have it in  their programme to make the practice of religion more austere while  widening its basis, to free the intelligence of believers from  scholastic trammels, and at the same time to enforce more strictly the  higher moral law of the Koran, which has been so long and so strangely  violated. In this they stand in close resemblance to the \"Reformers\" of  Christianity; and some of the circumstances which have given them birth  are so analogous to those which Europe encountered in the fifteenth  century that it is impossible not to draw in one's own mind a parallel,  leading to the conviction that Islam, too, will work out for itself a  Reformation.    The two chief agents of religious reform in Europe were the misery of  the poor and the general spread of knowledge. It is difficult at this  distance of time to conceive how abject was the general state of the  European peasantry in the days of Louis XI. of France and Frederick III.  of Germany. The constant wars and almost as constant famines, the  general insecurity of the conditions of life, the dependence of a vast  majority of the poor on capricious patrons, the hideous growth of  corruption and licentiousness in the ruling classes, and the impotence  of the ruled to obtain justice, above all, the servile acquiescence of  religion, which should have protected them, in the political  illegalities daily witnessed--all these things, stirring the hearts of  men, caused them to cry out against the existing order of Church  discipline, and inclined them to Reform. On the other hand, as we all  know, the invention of printing had caused men to read and the invention  of the New World to travel. Moreover, in the fifteenth century the  Ottoman Turks, then an irresistible power, were invading Europe, and a  new element of contact with an outside world was created, and a new  fear. Christendom certainly at that time was in danger of political  annihilation, or fancied itself to be so, and the apprehensions of  devout persons in Central Europe were roused to a vivid consciousness of  impending evil by the thought that this"]]]
