[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#18)"],[1," Wigand had issued a third edition of  the \"Collected Writings on Music and Musicians\" (which have also been  translated into English by Mrs. Ritter), Breitkopf & Haertel atoned for  their error by purchasing the copyright.    Schumann's letters to his publishers show that he used to suggest his  own terms, which were commonly acceded to without protest. For his  famous quintet he asked twenty louis d'or, or about $100; for  \"Paradise and the Peri,\" $500; the piano concerto, $125; Liederalbum,  op. 79, $200; \"Manfred,\" $250. He frequently emphasizes his desire to  have his compositions printed in an attractive style, and in 1839  writes to Haertel that he cannot describe his pleasure on receiving the  \"Scenes of Childhood.\" \"It is the most charming specimen of musical  typography I have ever seen.\" The few misprints he discovers in it he  frankly attributes to his MS. In a letter to his friend Rosen he  writes that \"it must be a deucedly comic pleasure to read my  Sanskrit.\" But his musical handwriting appears to have been nearer to  Sanskrit than his epistolary, if we may judge by the specimen  fac-similes printed in Naumann's \"History of Music.\"    The promptness with which all the leading music publishers of Germany  issued complete editions of Schumann's vocal and pianoforte  compositions, as soon as the copyright had expired, shows how  profitable they must be. But during his lifetime it was quite  otherwise, and in a letter to Kossmaly he adduces the following four  reasons for this state of affairs: \"(1) inherent difficulties of form  and contents; (2) because, not being a virtuoso, I cannot perform them  in public; (3) because I am the editor of my musical paper, in which I  could not allude to them; (4) because Fink is editor of the other  paper, and would not allude to them.\" Elsewhere he remarks, concerning  this rival editor: \"It is really most contemptible on Fink's part not  to have mentioned a single one of my pianoforte compositions in nine  [seven] years, although they are always of such a character that it is  impossible to overlook them. It is not for my name's sake that I am  annoyed, but because I know what the future course of music is to be.\"  It was in behalf of this tendency that he toiled on his paper, which  at first barely paid its expenses, having only 500 subscribers several  years after its foundation. And he not only avoided puffing his own  compositions, but even inserted a contribution by his friend Kossmaly  in which he was placed in the second rank of vocal composers! Yet,  though he printed the article, he complains about it in a private  letter: \"In your article on the Lied, I was a little grieved that you  placed me in the _second_ class. I do not lay claim to the first, but  I think I have a claim to a place of _my own_, and least of all do I  wish to see myself associated with Reissiger, Curschmann, etc. I know  that my aims, my resources, are far beyond theirs, and I hope you will  concede this and not accuse me of vanity, which is far from me.\"    Many of the letters in the present collection are concerned with the  affairs of Schumann's paper, the _Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik_,  detailing his plans for removing it to a larger city than Leipsic, and  the atrocious red-tape difficulties and delays he was subjected to  when he finally did transfer it to Vienna. Although the paper was  exclusively devoted to music, the _Censur_ apparently took three or  four months to make up its mind whether the state was in danger or not  from the immigration of a new musical periodical. The editor confesses  that he did not find as much sympathy as he had expected in Vienna;  yet the city--as he writes some years later at Duesseldorf--\"continues  to attract one, as if the spirits of the departed great masters were  still visible, and as if it were the real musical home of Germany.\"  \"Eating and drinking here are incomparable. You would be delighted  with the Opera. Such singers and such an _ensemble_ we do not have.\"  \"The admirable Opera is a great treat for me, especially the chorus  and orchestra. Of such things we have _no conception_ in Leipsic. The  ballet would also amuse you.\" \"A more encouraging public it would be  difficult to find anywhere; it is really too encouraging--in the  theatre one hears more applause than music. It is very merry, but it  annoys me occasionally.\" \"But I assure you confidentially that long  and alone I should not care to live here; serious men and affairs are  here in little demand and little appreciated. A compensation for this  is found in the beautiful surroundings. Yesterday I was in the  cemetery where Beethoven and Schubert are buried. Just think what I  found on Beethoven's grave: _a pen_, and, what is more, a steel pen.  It was a happy omen for me and I shall preserve it religiously.\" On  Schubert's grave he found nothing, but in the city he found Schubert's  brother, a poor man with eight children and no possessions but a  number of his brother's manuscripts, including \"a few operas, four  great masses, four or five symphonies, and many other things.\" He  immediately wrote to Breitkopf & Haertel to make arrangements for their  publication.    It is anything but complimentary to the discernment of Viennese  publishers and musicians of that period that, eleven years after  Schubert's death, another composer had to come from Leipsic and give  to the world the works of a colleague who not only had genius of the  purest water, but the gift of giving utterance to his musical ideas in  a clear style, intelligible to the public. Schubert died in 1828, and  in 1842 Schumann could still write to one of his contributors: \"It is  time, it seems to me, that some one should write something weighty in  behalf of Schubert; doesn't this tempt you? True, his larger works are  not yet in print. But his vocal and pianoforte compositions suffice  for an approximate portrait. Consider the matter. Do you know his  symphony in C? A delightful composition, somewhat long, but  extraordinarily animated, in character entirely new.\" To a Belgian  friend who intended to write an article on the new tendencies in  pianoforte music, he wrote: \"Of older composers who have influenced  modern music I must name above all Franz Schubert.... Schubert's songs  are well known, but his pianoforte compositions (especially those for  four hands) I rate at least equally high.\"    Of the numerous criticisms of well-known composers contained in this  correspondence, a few more may be cited. They are mostly favorable in  tone, but concerning the \"Prophete\" he writes: \"The music appears to me  very poor; I cannot find words to express my aversion to it.\"  \"Lortzing's operas meet with success--to me almost incomprehensible.\"  To Carl Reinecke he writes that he is \"no friend of song-transcriptions  (for piano), and of Liszt's some are a real abomination to me.\" He  commends Reinecke's efforts in this direction because they are free  from pepper and sauce _a la_ Liszt. Nevertheless, those of Liszt's  song-transcriptions in which he did not indulge in too much bravura  ornamentation are models of musical translation, and the collection of  forty-two songs published by Breitkopf & Haertel should be in every  pianist's library. \"Of Chopin,\" he writes in 1836, \"I have a new ballad  [G minor]. It seems to me to be his most enchanting (though not most  _genial_) work; I told him, too, that I liked it best of all his  compositions. After a long pause and reflection he said: 'I am glad you  think so, it is also my favorite.' He also played for me a number of  new etudes, nocturnes, mazurkas--everything in an incomparable style.  It is touching to see him at the piano. You would be very fond of him.  Yet Clara is more of a _virtuoso_, and gives almost more significance  to his compositions than he does himself.\"    Brendel having sent him some of Palestrina's music, he writes that \"it  really sounds sometimes like music of the spheres--and what art at the  same time! I am convinced he is the greatest musical genius Italy has  produced.\" Nineteen years previous to this he had written from  Brescia: \"Were not the Italian language itself a kind of eternal music  (the Count aptly called it a long-drawn-out A-minor chord), I should  not hear anything rational. Of the ardor with which they play, you can  form no more conception than of their slovenliness and lack of  elegance and precision.\" Handel appears to be mentioned only once in  all of Schumann's correspondence (\"I consider 'Israel in Egypt' the  ideal of a choral work\"), but Bach is always on his tongue. The  following is one of the profoundest criticisms ever written: \"Mozart  and Haydn knew of Bach only a few pages and passages, and the effect  which Bach, if they had known him in all his greatness, would have had  on them, is incalculable. The harmonic depth, the poetic and humorous  qualities of modern music have their source chiefly in Bach:  Mendelssohn, Bennett, Chopin, Hiller, all the so-called Romanticists  (I mean those of the German school) _approximate in their music much  closer to Bach than to Mozart_.\"    To Wagner there are several references, betraying a most remarkable  struggle between critical honesty and professional jealousy. Thus, in  1845, Schumann writes to Mendelssohn of \"Tannhaeuser:\"    \"Wagner has just finished a new opera--no doubt a clever fellow, full  of eccentric notions, and bold beyond measure. The aristocracy is  still in raptures over him on account of his 'Rienzi,' but in reality  he cannot conceive or write four consecutive bars of good or even  correct music. What all these composers lack is the art of writing  pure harmonies and four-part choruses. The music is not a straw better  than that of 'Rienzi,' rather weaker, more artificial! But if I should  write this I should be accused of envy, hence I say it only to you, as  I am aware that you have known all this a long time.\"    But in another letter to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18571"],[0,"The Northmen, Columbus and Cabot, 985-1503 (#18)"],[1,"of Greenland. The exact date of his  consecration is not known; but the Lawman's Annals have, under date of  1112, these words: \"Bishop Eric's expedition,\" referring no doubt to his  departure from Iceland. There is no record of his consecration at Lund  (Sweden), the seat of the primate at that time, as in the case of his  successor, Bishop Arnold. In regard to Bishop Eric's seeking Vinland,  there is no indication anywhere why he went, or whether he ever returned.  At any rate, the Greenlanders applied for a new bishop, and, according to  the annals, one was consecrated in 1124; this was Bishop Arnold, and he  reached Greenland the following year.

PAPAL LETTERS CONCERNING THE BISHOPRIC OF GARDAR IN GREENLAND DURING THE  FIFTEENTH CENTURY[70-1]      LETTER OF NICHOLAS V., _September_ 20, 1448    Called by a command from on high to preside over all the churches in the  exercise of our apostolic duty, with the Lord's help we employ all our  solicitude in laboring for the salvation of souls redeemed by the  precious blood of Christ, and we strive earnestly to restore to a state  of peace and tranquillity, not only those who are frequently tossed about  by the storms of impiety and error, but also those who are involved in  the hardships and whirlwinds of persecution. Profoundly impressed  therefore with the responsibility of our position, it is not difficult to  understand how our mind was filled with bitterness by the tearful  lamentations[71-1] which have reached our ears from our beloved children,  the native and other inhabitants of the island of Greenland, a region  situated at the uttermost end of the earth. The island, belonging[71-2]  to the kingdom of Norway, and under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of  the Archbishop of Drontheim,[71-3] received the faith of Christ almost  six[71-4] centuries ago, through the piety of blessed King Olaf, and  preserved it steadfastly and inviolably in accordance with the tradition  of the Roman Church, and the Apostolic See. After their conversion, the  people of this island, with untiring and characteristic devotion, erected  many temples[71-5] to the worship of God and his saints, as well as a  magnificent cathedral,[71-6] in which divine worship was diligently  celebrated, until about thirty[71-7] years ago, when God permitting it, a  barbarous and pagan fleet from neighboring shores[71-8] invaded the  island, laying waste the land with fire and sword, and destroying the  sacred temples. Just nine parish churches were left standing. To these  are attached, it is said, parishes of very great extent. These churches  are left intact, because being situated in the mountain fastnesses, they  were inaccessible to the barbarian hordes, who, after completing their  work of destruction, led captive to their shores the unfortunate  inhabitants of both sexes, and more particularly those who seemed best  able to bear the hardships of servitude and tyranny. But as the same  complaint sets forth, many of these captives, after a time, returned to  their native land. They set to work to rebuild their ruined homes, and  were particularly desirous of restoring divine worship to its former  splendor. Because, however, of their past calamities, as well as the  added trials of famine and want, they had not wherewith to support  priests or bishop. They have been consequently during these thirty years  past without the comfort and ministry of bishop or priest, unless some  one of a very zealous disposition, and at long intervals, and in spite of  danger from the raging sea, ventured to visit the island and minister to  them in those churches which the barbarians had left standing. Having  acquainted us with this deplorable state of affairs, and knowing our  paternal solicitude, they have supplicated us to come to their rescue in  this their hour of spiritual need. Our hearts have been moved by the  prayers of the people of Greenland, but not being sufficiently acquainted  with the circumstances, we direct and command you, or either of  you,[73-1] beloved brothers, who as we understand are the bishops living  nearest to that island, to institute a diligent inquiry as to whether  things are as they have been reported to us, and if you should find them  so, and the number of people warrant it, and if they are in a condition  to provide sufficiently, we command you or either of you, to send worthy  priests who will minister to them, erect churches, govern parishes, and  administer the sacraments.    Moreover, if you or either of you should deem it expedient, and in this  you will consult, of course, the metropolitan,[73-2] if his residence be  not too far away from you, we empower you to select and consecrate a  bishop, having first required him to take the usual oath to us and the  Roman See. Be mindful, however, that we burden your conscience with this  work, and we grant you, or either of you, full authority to carry it out,  even if there should exist any constitution of the Apostolic See, general  councils, canonical or other statutes to the contrary.    Given at Rome as dated above in the second year of our pontificate.      LETTER OF ALEXANDER VI.; WRITTEN IN THE FIRST YEARS OF HIS  PONTIFICATE[73-3]    It has been reported to us that in the diocese of Gardar in Greenland,  situated at the confines of the known world, the inhabitants, because of  the scarcity of bread, wine and oil, live for the most part on dried fish  and milk products. Wherefore because of the difficulty of passing through  such immense quantities of ice, and likewise because of the poverty of  the land, and the scant means of living, ships rarely visit its shores.  We have learned in fact that no vessel has touched there during the past  eighty years, and if a voyage be made at all, it must be in the month of  August, when the ice has broken up. On this account, during eighty years  no bishop or priest has resided personally among those people, and by  reason of this, we are informed that many who were formerly Catholics  have forgotten the faith of their baptism, and that no memory of the  Christian religion is found, except a corporal, which is shown to the  people once a year, and on which it is said the last priest who  officiated there consecrated the body of Christ a hundred years  ago.[74-1] In consideration of these things, Innocent the VIII., our  predecessor of happy memory, wishing to provide a proper pastor for those  forlorn people, conferred with his brethren, of whom we were one, and  elected Matthias, our venerable brother, a member of the Order of St.  Benedict, as well as professed monk, at our suggestion, and while we were  still in minor orders, to be Bishop of Gardar. This good man, fired with  great zeal to recall those people from the way of error to the practice  of their faith, is about to undertake this perilous voyage and laborious  duty.[74-2] We, on our part, accordingly, recognizing the pious and  praiseworthy purpose of the same elect, and wishing to succor in some  manner his poverty, which is very great indeed, command the officials of  our chancery, as well as those of our palace, under pain of  excommunication _ipso facto_ to be incurred, that all apostolic letters  destined for the church of Gardar, be written gratis for the glory of God  alone, without exacting or charging any stipend; and we command the  clergy and notaries of our palace to forward all letters to the above  mentioned bishop, without demanding any payment whatsoever for services  rendered.    To him everything must be free, other things to the contrary  notwithstanding.    FOOTNOTES:    [70-1] In 1893 an American in Rome, Mr. J.C. Heywood, one of the papal  chamberlains, brought out, in a very small edition (twenty-five copies),  a book of photographic facsimiles of documents in the Vatican relating to  Greenland and the discovery of America, _Documenta Selecta e Tabulario  Secreto Vaticano_. The Latin text of those here presented may be found in  Fischer, _Discoveries of the Northmen_, pp. 49-51. A translation of all  was made for the Tennessee Historical Society by Rev. John B. Morris and  printed in Vol. IX. of the society's organ, the _American Historical  Magazine_. Using this translation, we have printed Letters IX. and X. as  the only ones that contain anything of particular interest concerning the  Gardar bishopric in Greenland, excepting, possibly, the following  sentence from Letter II. (December 4, 1276), to the Archbishop of  Drontheim: \"Your Fraternity having been explicitly directed by letters  apostolic to visit personally all parts of the kingdom of Norway, for the  purpose of collecting the tithes due the Holy Land, has informed us that  this seems almost impossible, when it is taken into consideration that  the diocese of Gardar in Greenland is so remote from your metropolitan  see and kingdom, that five years or more would be consumed in going  thither and returning.\" It has been inferred, on account of the length of  this time, that the Vinland colony was included. There is no documentary  evidence of this. The papal letters contain no reference to Vinland.    [71-1] No record of these reports from Greenland has been found.    [71-2] Both Iceland and Greenland came under Norwegian rule in 1261,  during the reign of Haakon Haakonson (1217-1263).    [71-3] In Norway.    [71-4] Only four and a half centuries before this time.
