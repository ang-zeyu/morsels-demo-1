Why, he       voted against the country _both_ times, _for_ the Catholic bill and       then against the Reform.' What would this atrocious ministry have       said had the appeal to the voice of the people, which they now       quote as their authority, been made in 1829? I held forth to a       working man, possibly a forty-shilling freeholder, [he adds in a       fragment of later years,] on the established text, reform was       revolution. To corroborate my doctrine I said, 'Why, look at the       revolutions in foreign countries,' meaning of course France and       Belgium. The man looked hard at me and said these very words, 'Damn       all foreign countries, what has old England to do with foreign       countries?' This is not the only time that I have received an       important lesson from a humble source.                              SPEECH AT THE UNION    A more important scene which his own future eminence made in a sense  historic, was a debate at the Union upon Reform in the same month, where  his contribution (May 17th) struck all his hearers with amazement, so  brilliant, so powerful, so incomparably splendid did it seem to their  young eyes. His description of it to his brother (May 20th, 1831) is  modest enough:--         I should really have been glad if your health had been such as to       have permitted your visiting Oxford last week, so that you might       have heard our debate, for certainly there had never been anything       like it known here before and will scarcely be again. The       discussion on the question that the ministers were incompetent to       carry on the government of the country was of a miscellaneous       character, and I moved what they called a 'rider' to the effect       that the Reform bill threatened to change the form of the British       government, and ultimately to break up the whole frame of society.       The debate altogether lasted three nights, and it closed then,       partly because the _votes_ had got tired of dancing attendance,       partly because the speakers of the revolutionary side were       exhausted. There were eight or nine more on ours ready, and indeed       anxious. As it was, there were I think fifteen speeches on our side       and thirteen on theirs, or something of that kind. Every man spoke       above his average, and many very far beyond it. They were generally       short enough. Moncreiff, a long-winded Scotsman, spouted nearly an       hour, and I was guilty of three-quarters. I remember at Eton (where       we used, when I first went into the society, to speak from three to       ten minutes) I thought it must be one of the finest things in the       world to speak for three-quarters of an hour, and there was a       legend circulated about an old member of the society's having done       so, which used to make us all gape and stare. However, I fear it       does not necessarily imply much more than length. Doyle spoke       remarkably well, and made a violent attack on Mr. Canning's       friends, which Gaskell did his best to answer, but very       ineffectually from the nature of the case. We got a conversion       speech from a Christ Church gentleman-commoner, named Alston, which       produced an excellent effect, and the division was favourable       beyond anything we had hoped--ninety-four to thirty-eight. We       should have had larger numbers still had we divided on the first       night. Great diligence was used by both parties in bringing men       down, but the tactics on the whole were better on our side, and we       had fewer truants in proportion to our numbers. England expects       every man to do his duty; and ours, humble as it is, has been done       in reference to this question. On Friday I wrote a letter to the       _Standard_ giving an account of the division, which you will see in       Saturday's paper, if you think it worth while to refer to it. The       way in which the present generation of undergraduates is divided       on the question is quite remarkable.    The occasion was to prove a memorable one in his career, and a few more  lines about it from his diary will not be considered superfluous:--         _May 16th._--Sleepy. Mathematics, few and shuffling, and lecture.       Read Canning's reform speeches at Liverpool and made extracts. Rode       out. Debate, which was adjourned. I am to try my hand to-morrow. My       thoughts were but ill-arranged, but I fear they will be no better       then. Wine with Anstice. Singing. Tea with Lincoln.         _May 17th._--Ethics. Little mathematics. A good deal exhausted in       forenoon from heat last night. Dined with White and had wine with       him, also with young Acland. Cogitations on reform, etc. Difficult       to _select_ matter for a speech, not to gather it. _Spoke at the       adjourned debate for three-quarters of an hour_; immediately after       Gaskell, who was preceded by Lincoln. Row afterwards and       adjournment. Tea with Wordsworth.    When Gladstone sat down, one of his contemporaries has written, 'we all  of us felt that an epoch in our lives had occurred. His father was so  well pleased with the glories of the speech and with its effect, that he  wished to have it published. Besides his speech, besides the composition  of sturdy placards against the monstrous bill, and besides the  preparation of an elaborate petition[51] and the gathering of 770  signatures to it, the ardent anti-reformer, though the distance from the  days of doom in the examination schools was rapidly shrinking, actually  sat down to write a long pamphlet (July 1831) and sent it to Hatchard,  the publisher. Hatchard doubted the success of an anonymous pamphlet,  and replied in the too familiar formula that has frozen so many thousand  glowing hearts, that he would publish it if the author would take the  money risk. The most interesting thing about it is the criticism of the  writer's shrewd and wise father upon his son's performance (too long for  reproduction here). He went with his son in the main, he says, 'but I  cannot go all your lengths,' and the language of his judgment sheds a  curious light upon the vehement temperament of Mr. Gladstone at this  time as it struck an affectionate yet firm and sober monitor.                      *       *       *       *       *                           HEARS HIS FIRST DEBATE    In the autumn of 1831 Mr. Gladstone took some trouble to be present on  one of the cardinal occasions in this fluctuating history:--         _October 3rd to 8th._--Journey to London. From Henley in       Blackstone's chaise. Present at five nights' debate of infinite       interest in the House of Lords. The first, I went forwards and       underwent a somewhat high pressure. At the four others sat on a       round transverse rail, very fortunate in being so well placed. Had       a full view of the peeresses. There nine or ten hours every       evening. Read Peel's speech and sundry papers relating to King's       College, which I went to see; also London Bridge. Read introduction       to Butler. Wrote to Saunders. Much occupied in order-hunting during       the morning. Lord Brougham's as a speech most wonderful, delivered       with a power and effect which cannot be appreciated by any hearsay       mode of information, and with fertile exuberance in sarcasm. In       point of argument it had, I think, little that was new. Lord Grey's       most beautiful, Lord Goderich's and Lord Lansdowne's extremely       good, and in these was comprehended nearly all the oratorical merit       of the debate. The reasoning or the attempt to reason,       independently of the success in such attempt, certainly seemed to       me to be with the opposition. Their best speeches, I thought, were       those of Lords Harrowby, Carnarvon, Mansfield, Wynford; next Lords       Lyndhurst, Wharncliffe, and the Duke of Wellington. Lord Grey's       reply I did not hear, having been compelled by exhaustion to leave       the House. Remained with Ryder and Pickering in the coffee-room or       walking about until the division, and joined Wellesley and       [illegible] as we walked home. Went to bed for an hour,       breakfasted, and came off by the Alert. Arrived safely, thank God,       in Oxford. Wrote to my brother and to Gaskell. Tea with Phillimore       and spent the remainder of the evening with Canning. The       consequences of the vote may be awful. God avert this. But it was       an honourable and manly decision, and so may God avert them.    This was the memorable occasion when the Lords threw out the Reform bill  by 199 to 158, the division not taking place until six o'clock in the  morning. The consequences, as the country instantly made manifest, were  'awful' enough to secure the reversal of the decision. It seems, so far  as I can make out, to have been the first debate that one of the most  consummate debaters that ever lived had the fortune of listening to.                                         V                            READING FOR THE SCHOOLS    Meanwhile intense interest in parliament and the newspapers had not  impaired his studies. Disgusted as he was at the political outlook, in  the beginning of July he had fallen fairly to work more or less close  for ten or twelve hours a day. It 'proved as of old a cure for  ill-humour, though in itself not of the most delectable kind. It is odd  enough, though true, that reading hard close-grained stuff produces a  much more decided and better effect in this way, than books written  professedly for the purpose of entertainment.' Then his eyes became  painful, affected the head, and in August almost brought him to a full  stop. After absolute remission of work for a few days, he slowly spread  full sail again, and took good care no more to stint either exercise or  sleep, thinking himself, strange as it now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#18)"],[1,"and  dejected-looking audience which assembled in the Hall to hear the  report.    Rhoda sat tense on her seat, and puzzled for some moments over the  meaning of a certain dull, throbbing noise, before discovering that it  was the beating of her own heart.  It seemed to her morbid sensitiveness  that every eye was upon her, that everyone was waiting to hear what  place the new girl had taken.  When Miss Bruce began to read she could  hardly command herself sufficiently to listen, but the first mention of  her own name brought her to her bearings with a shock of dismay.  After  all her work, her care, her preparation, to be so low as this, to take  so poor a place!  The mortification was so bitter that she would fain  have hidden herself out of reach of consolation, but to her surprise, so  far from condoling, teachers and pupils alike seemed surprised that she  had done so well.    \"You have worked admirably, Rhoda.  I am pleased with you,\" said Miss  Murray.    \"Well done, Fuzzy!\" cried Tom, and even Miss Bruce said graciously:    \"Very good progress for a first term, Rhoda!\"    It was evident from their manner that they meant what they said, and  another girl might have gleaned comfort from the realisation that she  had expected too much of her own abilities.  Not so Rhoda!  It was but  an added sting to discover that she had been ranked so low, that an even  poorer result would have created no astonishment.  She was  congratulated, forsooth, on what seemed to her the bitterest  humiliation!  If anything was needed to strengthen the determination to  excel at any and every cost, this attitude of the school was sufficient.  In the solitude of the cubicle she vowed to herself that the day should  come, and that speedily, when she would be estimated at her right value.  She stood in the damp and cold gazing up at the Record Wall, and  renewed the vow with fast-beating heart.  The sun struggled from behind  the clouds and lit up the surface of the tablets, and the Honours girl,  and the B.A. girl, and the girls who had won the scholarships, seemed to  smile upon her and wish her success, but Eleanor Newman's name was in  the shade.  The sun had not troubled to light it up.  She was \"stupid,\"  and had never won a prize.    The last two days were broken and unsatisfactory, and Rhoda longed for  the time of departure to arrive; yet it was not without a pang of regret  that she opened her eyes on the last morning, and gazed round the little  blue cubicle.  It was delightful to be going home, yet school had its  strong points, and there were one or two partings ahead which could not  be faced without depression.  How nice it would be if she could take all  her special friends home--Dorothy and Kathleen, and Miss Everett, and--  yes!  Tom herself; for, wonderful to state, she was unaffectedly sorry  to part from Tom.  What fun they would have had running riot in Erley  Chase, and summoning the whole household to wait on their caprices!    The gong rang, and all the little bells followed suit in their usual  objectionable fashion, but the girls yawned and lay still for another  five minutes, aware that leniency was the order of the day.  The roll of  the organ and the first two lines of the hymn found them still in bed,  and the words were clearly distinguishable:--      Awake my soul, and with the sun, Thy daily course of duty run--    \"How stupid!\" commented Rhoda to herself.  \"`Course of duty' on the very  day we are leaving school.  What a ridiculous choice!\" and then she  tumbled out of bed and listened no more.    The rest of the morning seemed a comical Alice-in-Wonderland repetition  of the day of arrival.  The same long queues were formed to march down,  instead of upstairs; the teachers stood on the landings to say good-bye,  instead of welcome; the \"Black Marias\" bore the pupils to, instead of  from, the station, where the saloon carriages stood waiting as before.  The Blues crowded into one carriage, and Tom seated herself by Rhoda,  and with twinkling eyes called attention to the undulating beauty of the  landscape.  It was all exactly the same, yet delightfully different, for  now there was no shyness nor restraint, but the agreeable consciousness  of liberty to chaff in return, and be as cheeky as one chose.    There was unceasing talk on the journey, yet each girl realised as the  train steamed into Euston that she had forgotten to say the most  important things, and was divided between regret and anxiety to look out  for friends waiting on the platform.  Rhoda had heard that Harold was to  meet her, and presently there he was--handsomer than ever, or looking so  after the three months' separation, and as immaculate as if he had  stepped out of the traditional bandbox.    \"There he is!  That's Harold!  That's my brother!\" she cried, with a  thrill of pride in the tall, frock-coated figure; and Thomasina looked,  and rolled her little eyes to the ceiling.    \"What a bee-ootiful young man!  A perfect picter!  Give him my fond  love, Fuzzy, and say that I am desolated not to be able to stay to make  his acquaintance, but I must make a bolt for my train.\"    She seized her bag as she spoke and hurried to the door, prepared to  jump on to the platform at the first possible moment, while her  companions impatiently followed in her wake.  Rhoda had a vague  recollection of promising to write regularly to half a dozen girls, and  then she was shaking hands with Harold, and laughing in pure joy at  seeing the familiar face.    \"Here I am!  Here I am!  I have come back at last!\"    \"So I see!\"  He swept a glance over her, half smiling, half startled.  \"Awfully glad to see you.  Got your luggage in the van, eh?  Don't know  how on earth we shall get hold of it in this crowd.  What an--excuse  me!--an appalling set of girls!\"    \"I thought so too, at first, but they look different when you know them.  Some of them are sweet, and awfully pretty.\"    \"Humph!\" said Harold, sceptically.  \"They are not conspicuous.  I don't  see a decent-looking girl anywhere, except--who's the girl in the grey  hat?\"    \"That's Miss Everett, our house-mistress, the one I'm so fond of--the  one who has the invalid brother, you know, to whom mother sent the  game!\"    \"Teacher, is she?  I thought she was a pupil.  Sorry for her, poor  little thing, if she has to manage a lot of girls like you.  Ha!  `R.C.'  That's your box at last.  I'll get a porter to put it on a four-  wheeler.  Watch where I go, and keep close behind.\"    He strolled forward, and such was the effect of his imposing appearance  and lordly ways, that the porters flew to do his bidding, and piled the  luggage on the cab, while others who had been first on the scene were  still clamouring for attention.  Rhoda glanced proudly at him as they  drove away together, but the admiration evidently was on one side, for  he frowned, and said critically--    \"You--er--look pale!  You have lost your colour!\"    \"I've been working hard.\"    \"You have grown thinner!\"    \"Games, I suppose.  We are always running about.\"    \"Er--what has become of your hair?\"    Rhoda first stared, and then laughed.    \"Oh, my pigtail!  I forgot that you hadn't seen it.  I hated it too, at  first, but I've grown accustomed to it, and find it very comfortable.  It worries me now to have my hair blowing about and tickling my face.\"    \"All the same, my dear, you had better untie it before we get home.  We  will lunch at the Station Hotel, and you can comb it out there.  It will  give the mater a shock if she sees you looking so changed.  She would  hardly know you, I think.\"    The tone of disapproval hit hard, and to hide her chagrin Rhoda adopted  an air of indifference.    \"Oh, we don't trouble ourselves about appearances at Hurst.  So long as  we are comfortable we are satisfied.  If a girl worries to dress up, we  chaff her unmercifully.\"    \"The more foolish you!  I hope and pray, Rhoda, that you are not going  to develop into one of the strong-minded young women one meets nowadays,  who seem to spend their lives in trying to be as much like men as  possible.  It will be a mistake if you do.  Be as learned as you like,  and as sensible as you like, and as hardy as you like--that is all to  the good--but, for pity's sake, be pretty too, and dainty, and feminine!  We don't want to have all our womenkind swallowed up in athletes,  warranted to be `hard kicks,' or `useful forwards!'  We want them to  play the ornamental part in life, and be pretty, and sweet, and  attractive.\"    \"Ha, ha, yes!  That's the man's point of view!\" quoth Rhoda loftily, and  her brother smiled good-naturedly as the cab stopped before the hotel.    \"It is, my dear, that's very certain; and as you will probably meet a  good many men as you go through life, you might as well study their  opinion.  It may be regrettable, but it is certainly true, that you will  have more influence if you are agreeable to look at.  You would have  more influence over _me_ at this moment if you would kindly walk  upstairs and make yourself look--er--a little more like your old self!\"    \"Oh, I don't mind.  Anything to please you!\" said Rhoda carelessly, and  strode upstairs after the chambermaid, smiling to herself in lofty  superiority at Harold's \"dandy ways.\"  She did not smile, however, when,  on coming suddenly in front of the mirror, she caught a full-length  reflection of herself, for her brother's presence had unconsciously  altered her point of view, so that she saw herself no longer from the  standpoint of Hurst Manor, but that of Erley Chase.  Yes, Harold was  right!  It was not only the pigtail; there was an indefinable difference  in her whole appearance.  The clothes were the same, the girl was the  same, but there was no longer the immaculate neatness, the dainty care,  the well-groomed look which had once characterised her.  In her usual  impetuous fashion, she had rushed from one extreme to the other; in  discarding vanity,"]]]
