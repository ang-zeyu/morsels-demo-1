This establishment was especially under the care of  \"old\" and \"young\" Barney--father and son. Old Barney was a fine looking  old man, of a brownish complexion, who was quite portly, and wore a  dignified aspect for a slave. He was, evidently, much devoted to his  profession, and held his office an honorable one. He was a farrier as  well as an ostler; he could bleed, remove lampers from the mouths of the  horses, and was well instructed in horse medicines. No one on the farm  knew, so well as Old Barney, what to do with a sick horse. But his gifts  and acquirements were of little advantage to him. His office was by  no means an enviable one. He often got presents, but he got stripes as  well; for in nothing was Col. Lloyd more unreasonable and exacting,  than in respect to the management of his pleasure horses. Any supposed  inattention to these animals were sure to be visited with degrading  punishment. His horses and dogs fared better than his men. Their beds  must be softer and cleaner than those of his human cattle. No excuse  could shield Old Barney, if the colonel only suspected something  wrong about his horses; and, consequently, he was often punished when  faultless. It was absolutely painful to listen to the many unreasonable  and fretful scoldings, poured out at the stable, by Col. Lloyd, his sons  and sons-in-law. Of the latter, he had three--Messrs. Nicholson, Winder  and Lownes. These all{88} lived at the great house a portion of the  year, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased,  which was by no means unfrequently. A horse was seldom brought out of  the stable to which no objection could be raised. \"There was dust in  his hair;\" \"there was a twist in his reins;\" \"his mane did not lie  straight;\" \"he had not been properly grained;\" \"his head did not look  well;\" \"his fore-top was not combed out;\" \"his fetlocks had not been  properly trimmed;\" something was always wrong. Listening to complaints,  however groundless, Barney must stand, hat in hand, lips sealed, never  answering a word. He must make no reply, no explanation; the judgment  of the master must be deemed infallible, for his power is absolute  and irresponsible. In a free state, a master, thus complaining without  cause, of his ostler, might be told--\"Sir, I am sorry I cannot please  you, but, since I have done the best I can, your remedy is to dismiss  me.\" Here, however, the ostler must stand, listen and tremble. One of  the most heart-saddening and humiliating scenes I ever witnessed, was  the whipping of Old Barney, by Col. Lloyd himself. Here were two men,  both advanced in years; there were the silvery locks of Col. L., and  there was the bald and toil-worn brow of Old Barney; master and slave;  superior and inferior here, but _equals_ at the bar of God; and, in the  common course of events, they must both soon meet in another world, in  a world where all distinctions, except those based on obedience and  disobedience, are blotted out forever. \"Uncover your head!\" said the  imperious master; he was obeyed. \"Take off your jacket, you old rascal!\"  and off came Barney's jacket. \"Down on your knees!\" down knelt the old  man, his shoulders bare, his bald head glistening in the sun, and  his aged knees on the cold, damp ground. In his humble and debasing  attitude, the master--that master to whom he had given the best years  and the best strength of his life--came forward, and laid on thirty  lashes, with his horse whip. The old man bore it patiently, to the last,  answering each blow with a slight shrug of the shoulders, and a groan.  I cannot think that{89} Col. Lloyd succeeded in marring the flesh of Old  Barney very seriously, for the whip was a light, riding whip; but the  spectacle of an aged man--a husband and a father--humbly kneeling before  a worm of the dust, surprised and shocked me at the time; and since I  have grown old enough to think on the wickedness of slavery, few facts  have been of more value to me than this, to which I was a witness. It  reveals slavery in its true color, and in its maturity of repulsive  hatefulness. I owe it to truth, however, to say, that this was the first  and the last time I ever saw Old Barney, or any other slave, compelled  to kneel to receive a whipping.    I saw, at the stable, another incident, which I will relate, as it is  illustrative of a phase of slavery to which I have already referred in  another connection. Besides two other coachmen, Col. Lloyd owned one  named William, who, strangely enough, was often called by his surname,  Wilks, by white and colored people on the home plantation. Wilks was  a very fine looking man. He was about as white as anybody on the  plantation; and in manliness of form, and comeliness of features, he  bore a very striking resemblance to Mr. Murray Lloyd. It was whispered,  and pretty generally admitted as a fact, that William Wilks was a son  of Col. Lloyd, by a highly favored slave-woman, who was still on the  plantation. There were many reasons for believing this whisper, not only  in William's appearance, but in the undeniable freedom which he enjoyed  over all others, and his apparent consciousness of being something more  than a slave to his master. It was notorious, too, that William had a  deadly enemy in Murray Lloyd, whom he so much resembled, and that the  latter greatly worried his father with importunities to sell William.  Indeed, he gave his father no rest until he did sell him, to Austin  Woldfolk, the great slave-trader at that time. Before selling him,  however, Mr. L. tried what giving William a whipping would do, toward  making things smooth; but this was a failure. It was a compromise,  and defeated itself; for,{90} immediately after the infliction, the  heart-sickened colonel atoned to William for the abuse, by giving him  a gold watch and chain. Another fact, somewhat curious, is, that though  sold to the remorseless _Woldfolk_, taken in irons to Baltimore and  cast into prison, with a view to being driven to the south, William, by  _some_ means--always a mystery to me--outbid all his purchasers, paid  for himself, _and now resides in Baltimore, a_ FREEMAN. Is there not  room to suspect, that, as the gold watch was presented to atone for the  whipping, a purse of gold was given him by the same hand, with which  to effect his purchase, as an atonement for the indignity involved in  selling his own flesh and blood. All the circumstances of William, on  the great house farm, show him to have occupied a different position  from the other slaves, and, certainly, there is nothing in the supposed  hostility of slaveholders to amalgamation, to forbid the supposition  that William Wilks was the son of Edward Lloyd. _Practical_ amalgamation  is common in every neighborhood where I have been in slavery.    Col. Lloyd was not in the way of knowing much of the real opinions and  feelings of his slaves respecting him. The distance between him and  them was far too great to admit of such knowledge. His slaves were so  numerous, that he did not know them when he saw them. Nor, indeed, did  all his slaves know him. In this respect, he was inconveniently rich. It  is reported of him, that, while riding along the road one day, he met a  colored man, and addressed him in the usual way of speaking to colored  people on the public highways of the south: \"Well, boy, who do you  belong to?\" \"To Col. Lloyd,\" replied the slave. \"Well, does the colonel  treat you well?\" \"No, sir,\" was the ready reply. \"What? does he work you  too hard?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, don't he give enough to eat?\" \"Yes, sir,  he gives me enough, such as it is.\" The colonel, after ascertaining  where the slave belonged, rode on; the slave also went on about his  business, not dreaming that he had been conversing with his master. He  thought, said and heard nothing more of the matter, until two or three  weeks afterwards.{91} The poor man was then informed by his overseer,  that, for having found fault with his master, he was now to be sold to  a Georgia trader. He was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus,  without a moment's warning he was snatched away, and forever sundered  from his family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than that of  death. _This_ is the penalty of telling the simple truth, in answer to  a series of plain questions. It is partly in consequence of such facts,  that slaves, when inquired of as to their condition and the character of  their masters, almost invariably say they are contented, and that their  masters are kind. Slaveholders have been known to send spies among their  slaves, to ascertain, if possible, their views and feelings in regard to  their condition. The frequency of this had the effect to establish  among the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head. They  suppress the truth rather than take the consequence of telling it, and,  in so doing, they prove themselves a part of the human family. If they  have anything to say of their master, it is, generally, something in his  favor, especially when speaking to strangers. I was frequently asked,  while a slave, if I had a kind master, and I do not remember ever to  have given a negative reply. Nor did I, when pursuing this course,  consider myself as uttering what was utterly false; for I always  measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up  by slaveholders around us. However, slaves are like other people, and  imbibe similar prejudices. They are apt to think _their condition_  better than that of others. Many, under the influence of this prejudice,  think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and  this, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is  not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves  about the relative kindness of their masters, contending for the  superior goodness of his own over that of others.

Another hour was spent  beneath the rays of the hot sun in wiping, polishing, and oiling his  Enfield though the means at hand for drying it consisted principally of  dry grasses. It was afternoon before he had satisfied himself that his  precious weapon was safe from any harm by dirt, or dampness, and then  he arose and took up the search for the spoor he had followed to the  opposite side of the swamp.    Would he find again the trail that had led into the opposite side of  the morass, to be lost there, even to his trained senses? If he found  it not again upon this side of the almost impassable barrier he might  assume that his long journey had ended in failure. And so he sought up  and down the verge of the stagnant water for traces of an old spoor  that would have been invisible to your eyes or mine, even had we  followed directly in the tracks of its maker.    As Tarzan advanced upon the gryfs he imitated as closely as he could  recall them the methods and mannerisms of the Tor-o-don, but up to the  instant that he stood close beside one of the huge creatures he  realized that his fate still hung in the balance, for the thing gave  forth no sign, either menacing or otherwise.  It only stood there,  watching him out of its cold, reptilian eyes and then Tarzan raised his  staff and with a menacing \"Whee-oo!\" struck the GRYF a vicious blow  across the face.    The creature made a sudden side snap in his direction, a snap that did  not reach him, and then turned sullenly away, precisely as it had when  the Tor-o-don commanded it. Walking around to its rear as he had seen  the shaggy first-man do, Tarzan ran up the broad tail and seated  himself upon the creature's back, and then again imitating the acts of  the Tor-o-don he prodded it with the sharpened point of his staff, and  thus goading it forward and guiding it with blows, first upon one side  and then upon the other, he started it down the gorge in the direction  of the valley.    At first it had been in his mind only to determine if he could  successfully assert any authority over the great monsters, realizing  that in this possibility lay his only hope of immediate escape from his  jailers. But once seated upon the back of his titanic mount the ape-man  experienced the sensation of a new thrill that recalled to him the day  in his boyhood that he had first clambered to the broad head of Tantor,  the elephant, and this, together with the sense of mastery that was  always meat and drink to the lord of the jungle, decided him to put his  newly acquired power to some utilitarian purpose.    Pan-at-lee he judged must either have already reached safety or met  with death. At least, no longer could he be of service to her, while  below Kor-ul-GRYF, in the soft green valley, lay A-lur, the City of  Light, which, since he had gazed upon it from the shoulder of  Pastar-ul-ved, had been his ambition and his goal.    Whether or not its gleaming walls held the secret of his lost mate he  could not even guess but if she lived at all within the precincts of  Pal-ul-don it must be among the Ho-don, since the hairy black men of  this forgotten world took no prisoners. And so to A-lur he would go,  and how more effectively than upon the back of this grim and terrible  creature that the races of Pal-ul-don held in such awe?    A little mountain stream tumbles down from Kor-ul-GRYF to be joined in  the foothills with that which empties the waters of Kor-ul-lul into the  valley, forming a small river which runs southwest, eventually entering  the valley's largest lake at the City of A-lur, through the center of  which the stream passes. An ancient trail, well marked by countless  generations of naked feet of man and beast, leads down toward A-lur  beside the river, and along this Tarzan guided the GRYF. Once clear of  the forest which ran below the mouth of the gorge, Tarzan caught  occasional glimpses of the city gleaming in the distance far below him.    The country through which he passed was resplendent with the riotous  beauties of tropical verdure. Thick, lush grasses grew waist high upon  either side of the trail and the way was broken now and again by  patches of open park-like forest, or perhaps a little patch of dense  jungle where the trees overarched the way and trailing creepers  depended in graceful loops from branch to branch.    At times the ape-man had difficulty in commanding obedience upon the  part of his unruly beast, but always in the end its fear of the  relatively puny goad urged it on to obedience. Late in the afternoon as  they approached the confluence of the stream they were skirting and  another which appeared to come from the direction of Kor-ul-JA the  ape-man, emerging from one of the jungle patches, discovered a  considerable party of Ho-don upon the opposite bank. Simultaneously  they saw him and the mighty creature he bestrode. For a moment they  stood in wide-eyed amazement and then, in answer to the command of  their leader, they turned and bolted for the shelter of the nearby wood.    The ape-man had but a brief glimpse of them but it was sufficient  indication that there were Waz-don with them, doubtless prisoners taken  in one of the raids upon the Waz-don villages of which Ta-den and Om-at  had told him.    At the sound of their voices the GRYF had bellowed terrifically and  started in pursuit even though a river intervened, but by dint of much  prodding and beating, Tarzan had succeeded in heading the animal back  into the path though thereafter for a long time it was sullen and more  intractable than ever.    As the sun dropped nearer the summit of the western hills Tarzan became  aware that his plan to enter A-lur upon the back of a GRYF was likely  doomed to failure, since the stubbornness of the great beast was  increasing momentarily, doubtless due to the fact that its huge belly  was crying out for food. The ape-man wondered if the Tor-o-dons had any  means of picketing their beasts for the night, but as he did not know  and as no plan suggested itself, he determined that he should have to  trust to the chance of finding it again in the morning.    There now arose in his mind a question as to what would be their  relationship when Tarzan had dismounted. Would it again revert to that  of hunter and quarry or would fear of the goad continue to hold its  supremacy over the natural instinct of the hunting flesh-eater? Tarzan  wondered but as he could not remain upon the GRYF forever, and as he  preferred dismounting and putting the matter to a final test while it  was still light, he decided to act at once.    How to stop the creature he did not know, as up to this time his sole  desire had been to urge it forward. By experimenting with his staff,  however, he found that he could bring it to a halt by reaching forward  and striking the thing upon its beaklike snout. Close by grew a number  of leafy trees, in any one of which the ape-man could have found  sanctuary, but it had occurred to him that should he immediately take  to the trees it might suggest to the mind of the GRYF that the creature  that had been commanding him all day feared him, with the result that  Tarzan would once again be held a prisoner by the triceratops.    And so, when the GRYF halted, Tarzan slid to the ground, struck the  creature a careless blow across the flank as though in dismissal and  walked indifferently away. From the throat of the beast came a low  rumbling sound and without even a glance at Tarzan it turned and  entered the river where it stood drinking for a long time.    Convinced that the GRYF no longer constituted a menace to him the  ape-man, spurred on himself by the gnawing of hunger, unslung his bow  and selecting a handful of arrows set forth cautiously in search of  food, evidence of the near presence of which was being borne up to him  by a breeze from down river.    Ten minutes later he had made his kill, again one of the Pal-ul-don  specimens of antelope, all species of which Tarzan had known since  childhood as Bara, the deer, since in the little primer that had been  the basis of his education the picture of a deer had been the nearest  approach to the likeness of the antelope, from the giant eland to the  smaller bushbuck of the hunting grounds of his youth.    Cutting off a haunch he cached it in a nearby tree, and throwing the  balance of the carcass across his shoulder trotted back toward the spot  at which he had left the GRYF. The great beast was just emerging from  the river when Tarzan, seeing it, issued the weird cry of the  Tor-o-don. The creature looked in the direction of the sound voicing at  the same time the low rumble with which it answered the call of its  master. Twice Tarzan repeated his cry before the beast moved slowly  toward him, and when it had come within a few paces he tossed the  carcass of the deer to it, upon which it fell with greedy jaws.    \"If anything will keep it within call,\" mused the ape-man as he  returned to the tree in which he had cached his own portion of his  kill, \"it is the knowledge that I will feed it.\" But as he finished his  repast and settled himself comfortably for the night high among the  swaying branches of his eyrie he had little confidence that he would  ride into A-lur the following day upon his prehistoric steed.    When Tarzan awoke early the following morning he dropped lightly to the  ground and made his way to the stream. Removing his weapons and loin  cloth he entered the cold waters of the little pool, and after his  refreshing bath returned to the tree to breakfast upon another portion  of Bara, the deer, adding to his repast some fruits and berries which  grew in abundance nearby.    His meal over he sought the ground again and raising his voice in the  weird cry that he had learned, he called aloud on the chance of  attracting the GRYF, but though he waited for some time and continued  calling there was no response, and he was"]]]
