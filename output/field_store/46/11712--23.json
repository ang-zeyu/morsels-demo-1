You come along with us, Tom, we'll  take you to a place where you'll get your money's worth and no mistake.  Won't we, Jack?\"    The youth appealed to as Jack answered with a most affected drawl, and  with an effort which appeared to cause him no little fatigue, \"Wathah.\"    \"Come along,\" said Gus, lighting a fresh cigarette.    Tom was uncomfortable.  He would not for worlds seem unwilling to go,  and yet he wished he could get out of it somehow.    \"Very kind of you,\" he said, \"I'd like it awfully; but I must get back  to do some work, you know, I've an exam coming on.  It's an awful  nuisance!\"    \"Why, I thought you were going in here, in any case!\" said Gus.    \"Ah--well--yes, so I was, just for a little, to see what sort of affair  it was; but I meant to be home by nine.\"    \"Well, just have a squint in at our place; and if you must go, you must.  Come along, old man; cut work for one evening, can't you?  You've  become an awfully reformed character all of a sudden; you usen't to be  so hot on your books.\"    Tom had no ambition before these two to figure in the light of a  reformed character, and he therefore abandoned further protest, and  proceeded to accompany Gus and his friend down the street.    \"Have a weed?\" asked Gus.    \"Thanks, I hardly ever smoke,\" said Tom.    \"They're very mild,\" said Gus, with a sneer.    Tom took the proffered cigar without another word, and did his best  first to light and then to smoke it as if he were an experienced smoker.    \"Who's your fwend?\" inquired Gus's languid acquaintance.    \"By the way,\" said that young man, \"I've never introduced you two.  Mortimer, allow me to introduce you to my friend Tom Drift.\"    Mr Mortimer gave a nod which Tom felt he would like greatly to have at  his command, there was something so very knowing and familiar about it.    \"It was Tom got up that little race party I was telling you of, Jack,  you know.  He's a regular sporting card.  By the way, what's become of  that little mooney-face prig we took with us that day; eh, Tom?\"    Tom was out in midstream now, floating fast out to sea.    \"Who--oh, young Newcome?\" said he; \"he's still at Randlebury.\"    \"Young puppy!  You never knew such a spree as that was, Jack,\" said Gus;  and then he launched forth into a highly-spiced account of the eventful  expedition to Gurley races, contriving to represent Tom as the hero of  the day, greatly to that youth's discomfort and confusion, and no less  to the amusement of Mr Mortimer.    \"Here we are at last,\" said Gus, as the trio arrived at a gorgeously  illuminated and decorated restaurant.    Tom's heart sunk within him.  More than ever did he wish himself back in  his dull lodgings, never again to set foot abroad, if only he could have  got out of this fix.  But there was no drawing back.    \"Shall we go in yet, or knock the balls about for a bit?\" said Gus.  \"This fellow Tom's a regular swell at billiards.  Do you remember  thrashing me last time we met, Tom--the summer after I'd left  Randlebury?\"    Tom could not deny he had beaten Gus on the occasion referred to, and  felt it was useless for him to protest--what was the case--that he was  only a very indifferent player.  He agreed to the idea of a game,  however, as he hoped he might at its close be able to make his escape  without accompanying his two companions to the music-hall attached to  the restaurant, and which he already knew by reputation as one of the  lowest entertainments in London.  \"You two play,\" said Gus, \"and I'll  mark.  You'll have to give Jack points, Tom, you know, you're such a  dab.\"    It was vain for Tom to disclaim the distinction, and the game began.    \"Hold hard!\" said Gus, after the first stroke; \"what are you playing  for?\"    \"Weally, I don't know; thillingth, I thuppothe,\" lisped Mr Mortimer.    \"All serene!  Go on.\"    And they went on, and Mr Mortimer made no end of misses, so that, in  spite of the points he had received, Tom beat him easily.  In the two  games which followed the same success attended him, and he won all the  stakes.    \"Didn't I tell you he was a swell?\" said Gus.  \"Upon my word, Tom, I  don't know how you do it!\"    \"It's just the sort of table I like to play on,\" said Tom, elated with  his success, and unwilling to own that half his lucky shots had been  \"flukes.\"    \"I tell you what,\" said Gus; \"you owe me my revenge, you know, from last  time.  I'll play you to-morrow for half-crowns, if you'll give me the  same points as you did to Jack.\"    Tom was fast nearing the breakers now.  He had nothing for it but to  accept the challenge, and the table was consequently engaged for the  next evening.    \"I must be off now, you fellows!\" he said.    \"Nonsense!  Why, you haven't yet seen the fun below.  You must stay for  that.\"    \"I wish I could,\" faltered Tom; \"but I really must do some reading to-  night.\"    \"So you can; the thing only lasts an hour, and you're not obliged to go  to bed at eleven, are you?\"    Still Tom hesitated.    \"You don't mean to say you are squeamish about it?\" said Gus, in  astonishment.  \"I could fancy that young friend of your mother's turning  up _his_ eyes at it, but a fellow like you wouldn't be so particular, I  reckon; eh, Jack?\"    And Mr John Mortimer, thus appealed to, laughed an amused laugh at the  bare notion.    That laugh and the term, \"a fellow like you,\" destroyed the last of  Tom's wavering objections, and he yielded.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    HOW TOM DRIFT, STILL GOING DOWNHILL, MET MY OLD MASTER.    When Tom reached his lodgings that night he found a jubilant letter from  Charlie awaiting him.    \"Just fancy,\" he said, \"it's only three weeks more, old man, and then to  Jericho with books, and test-tubes, and anatomy!  I'll drag you out of  your study by the scruff of your neck, see if I don't; I'll clap a  knapsack on your back, and haul you by sheer force down into Kent.  There you shall snuff the ozone, and hold your hat on your head with  both hands on the cliff top.  I'll hound you through old castles, and  worry you up hills.  If I catch so much as a leaflet on chemistry in  your hands, I'll tear it up and send it flying after the sea-gulls.  In  short, I shouldn't like to say what I won't do, I'm so wild at the  prospect of a week with you.  Of course, the dear old people growl at me  for leaving them in the lurch; but they are glad for us to get the blow;  indeed, my pater insists on paying the piper, which is handsome of him.  I expect I shall get a day in London on my way, either going or  returning; and if you can put me up at your diggings for the night,  we'll have a jolly evening, and you can show me all your haunts.\"    Tom gasped as he got so far; and well he might.    \"I'll tell you all the news when I come.  I suppose, by your not  writing, you are saving yours up for me.  Ta, ta, old boy, and _au  revoir_ in twenty-one days!  Hurrah!  Yours ever,--C.N.\"    Tom, in his misery, crushed the letter up in his fingers and flung it  from him.  If a passing pang shot through his breast, it was followed  almost instantly by other feelings of vexation and shame.  One moment he  was ready to sink to the floor in a passion of penitence and remorse--  the next, he was ready to resent Charlie's influence over him even at a  distance, and to sneer, as Gus and his friend had done, at the boy's  expense.  His brain was too muddled with the excitement and the strange  emotions of that evening to reason with himself; his head ached, and his  mind was poisoned.    \"What right has the fellow always to be following me up in this way?\" he  asked.  \"I'm a fool to stand it.  Why can't I do as I choose without his  pulling a long face?\"    Thus Tom questioned, and thus he proved that it was Charlie's influence  more than his letter that worried him; for what had the latter said,  either in the way of exhortation or reproof?    Then he threw himself on the bed, and lay with the wild memory of the  evening crowding on his feverish mind.  He rose, and, lighting a candle,  endeavoured to read; but even his novel was flat and stupid, and in the  midst of it he fell asleep, to dream of Gus and his friend all night  long.  Long ere he awoke my senses had left me, for he had neglected to  wind me up.  Next morning he went to lectures as usual.  To his fellow-  students he appeared the same shy, quiet youth he had always seemed; to  Mr    Newcome, whom he met in the street, he appeared still as Charlie's  chosen and dear friend, ready for his holiday and rejoicing in the  prospect of the coming meeting; to his professors he appeared still the  same steady, hard-working student, bent on making his way in his  profession.  But to himself, alas! how altered, how degraded he  appeared!    In the midst of his duties his thoughts ran continually--now back to the  strange experience of last evening, now forward to the doubtful events  of this.    The recollection of the past had lost a good deal of its repulsiveness  after twelve hours' interval, and although he still felt it to be low  and harmful, he yet secretly encouraged his curiosity to revisit the  place of his temptation.    \"After all, it did me no harm,\" said he to himself; \"it's not interfered  with my work, or made me feel worse than before.  What harm in going  again to-night?  When Charlie comes, and we get away from town, I shall  easily be able to break it off; and besides, Charlie's sure to help to  put me square; he always does.  Yes; I think I'll just go and see what's  on there to-night; it can't be worse than it was.  Besides,\" thought he,  glad to seize on any straw of excuse, \"I'm bound in honour to play Gus a  return match; it would be ungentlemanly to back out of that.\"    But why sicken you, dear reader, and myself, with recapitulating the sad  workings of this poor fellow's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#18)"],[1," had been my  luck to secure that lively little pony for my journey home.    However, ten miles come to an end at last, and in due time I turned up  at Brownstroke pretty tired, and generally feeling somewhat down in the  mouth by my day's adventures.    But those adventures, or rather events, were not yet over; for that same  evening brought a letter with the London postmark and the initials M.,  B., and Company on the seal of the envelope!    You may fancy how eagerly I opened it.  It ran as follows:    \"Messrs. Merrett, Barnacle, and Company are in receipt of Frederick  Batchelor's application for junior clerkship, and in reply--\"    \"What?\"  I gasped to myself, as I turned over the leaf.    \"--would like to see Batchelor at their office on Saturday next at  10:15.\"    I could hardly believe my eyes.  I rushed to my uncle and showed him the  letter.    \"Isn't it splendid?\"  I cried.    \"Not at all,\" replied he.  \"Don't be too fast, you have not got the  place yet.\"    \"Ah, I know,\" said I, \"but I've a chance at least.\"    \"You have a chance against a dozen others,\" said my uncle, \"who most  likely have got each of them a letter just like this.\"    \"Well, but, of course, I must go on Saturday?\"    \"You still mean to try?\" said my uncle.    \"Why yes,\" said I resolutely.  \"I do.\"    \"Then you had better go to town on Saturday.\"    \"Won't you go with me?\"  I inquired nervously.    \"No,\" said my uncle; \"Merrett, Barnacle, and Company want to see you,  not me.\"    \"But--\" began I.  But I didn't say what I was going to say.  Why should  I tell my uncle I was afraid to go to London alone?    \"Where am I to live if I do _get_ the place?  London's such a big place  to be in.\"    \"Oh, we'll see to that,\" said my uncle, \"in due time.  Time enough for  that when you get your place.\"    This was true; and half elated, half alarmed by the prospect before me,  I took to my bed and went to sleep.    My dreams that night were a strange mixture of Merrett, Barnacle, and  Company, the little girl who fell from the pony, Jack Smith, and the  jovial baker; but among them all I slept very soundly, and woke like a  giant refreshed the next day.    If only I had been easy in my mind about Jack Smith, I should have been  positively cheerful.  But the thought of him, and the fact of his never  having called for my letters, sorely perplexed and troubled me.  Had he  forgotten all about me, then?  How I had pictured his delight in getting  that first letter of mine, when I wrote it surreptitiously in the  playground at Stonebridge House a year ago!  And I had meant it to be  such a jolly comforting letter, too; and after all here it was in my  pocket unopened.  I must just read it over again myself.  And I put my  hand in my pocket to get it.  To my surprise, however, only the last of  the two letters was there, and high or low I could not find the other.  It was very strange, for I distinctly remembered no having it in my hand  after leaving Packworth.  Then suddenly it occurred to me I must have  had it in my hand when I met the runaway pony, and in the confusion of  that adventure have dropped it.  So I had not even the satisfaction of  reading over my own touching effusion, which deprived me of a great  intellectual treat.    However, I had other things to think of, for to-morrow was Saturday, the  day on which I was to make my solitary excursion to London in quest of  the junior clerkship at Merrett, Barnacle, and Company's.        CHAPTER TEN.    HOW I RAN AGAINST MY FRIEND SMITH IN AN UNEXPECTED QUARTER.    I suppose my uncle thought it good discipline to turn a young fellow  like me adrift for a whole day in London to shift for myself, and  wrestle single-handed with the crisis that was to decide my destiny.    He may have been right, but when, after an hour's excited journey in the  train, I found myself along with several hundred fellow-mortals standing  in a street which seemed to be literally alive with people, I, at any  rate, neither admired his wisdom nor blessed him for his good  intentions.    Every one but myself seemed to be in a desperate hurry.  Had I not been  sure it was the way of the place, I should have been tempted to suppose  some tremendous fire, or some extraordinary event was taking place at  the other end of the street, and that every one was rushing to get a  glimpse of it.  I stood a minute or two outside the station, hoping to  be left behind; but behold, no sooner had the tail of the race passed  me, when another, indeed two other train-loads of humanity swarmed down  upon me, and, hustling me as they swept by, fairly carried me along with  them.    One thing alarmed me prodigiously.  It was not the crowd, or the noise,  or the cabs, or the omnibuses, or the newspaper-boys, or the shops, or  the policemen, or the chimney-pot hats.  These all astonished me, as  well they might.  But what terrified me was the number of boys like  myself who formed part of the procession, and who, every one of them as  I imagined, were hurrying towards Hawk Street.    My uncle had told me that I should find Hawk Street turning out at the  end of the street in which the station stood, and this was precisely the  direction in which these terrible boys were all going.    How knowing they all looked, and how confident!  There was not one of  them, I was certain, but was more intelligent than I, and quicker at  figures.  How I hated them as they swaggered along, laughing and joking  with one another, looking familiarly on the scene around them, crossing  the road in the very teeth of the cab-horses, and not one of them caring  or thinking a bit about me.  What chance had I among all these?    There was not much conceit left in me, I assure you, as I followed  meekly in their wake towards Hawk Street that morning.    My uncle's directions had been so simple that I had never calculated on  having any difficulty in finding my destination.  But it's all very well  in a quiet country town to find one street that turns out of another,  but in London, between nine and ten in the morning, it's quite a  different matter.  At least so I found it.  Half a dozen streets turned  out of the one which I and the stream descended, and though I carefully  studied the name of each in turn, no Hawk Street was there.    \"Can you tell me where Hawk Street is?\"  I inquired at last of a fellow-  passenger after a great inward struggle.    \"Hawk Street?  Yes.  Go through Popman's Alley, and up the second court  to the left--that'll bring you to Hawk Street.\"    \"But uncle said it turned--\" My guide had vanished!    I diligently sought for Popman's Alley, which I found to be a long paved  passage between two high blocks of buildings, and leading apparently  nowhere; at least I could discover no outlet, either at the end or  either side.  Every one was in such a hurry that I dared not \"pop the  question\" as to the whereabouts of Hawk Street again, but made my way  back once more to the entrance.  By this time I was so muddled that for  the life of me I could not tell which was the street I had come down,  still less how I could get back to it.    Ask my way I must, if I died for it!  Ten o'clock had struck ten minutes  ago, and I was due at Merrett, Barnacle, and Company's at 10:15.    I noticed a boy ahead of me walking rather more slowly than the rest.  I  would ask him, and stick to him till he put me right.  So I made up to  him boldly.    \"Will you show me the way to Hawk Street, please?\"  I said, as I came  up.    He turned round suddenly as I spoke.  Was it possible?  Here, in London,  where one might as soon expect to meet a body one knows as meet the man  in the moon!    It was my friend Smith!    \"Jack!\"  I exclaimed.    \"Fred!\" exclaimed Smith, seizing my hand.    There was no doubt about it, and no doubt about all my foolish  suspicions as to his having forgotten me or ceased to care for me being  groundless.  His solemn face lit up almost to a look of jubilation as he  grasped my hand and said, \"Why, Fred, old man, whatever are you doing  here?\"    \"What are _you_ doing?\" cried I.  \"Who ever would have thought of  running up against you in this place?  But I say,\" said I, suddenly  remembering the time.  \"I have got to be in Hawk Street in two minutes,  Jack.  For goodness' sake, show us the way, if you know it.\"    Smith opened his black eyes very wide.    \"You have to be somewhere in Hawk Street?\" he asked.    \"Yes.  Merrett, Barnacle, and Company's the name.  I'm after a place  they have got there.\"    Smith's face passed through a variety of expressions, ending in the old  solemn look as he quietly said, \"So am I.\"    \"You!\"  I exclaimed.  \"You after the same place?  Oh, Jack!\"    \"I'm awfully sorry,\" said he.  \"I didn't know--\"    \"Oh, it's not that,\" I interrupted, \"at all.  I wish they had two  places, though.\"    \"So do I.  Perhaps they have.  But I say, you'd better look sharp.\"    \"Aren't you coming too?\"  I said.    \"I haven't to be there till 10:30.  They'll see you first.\"    At that moment a clock chimed the quarter, and startled me nearly out of  my wits.    \"That's the time,\" cried I.  \"Where _ever_ is Hawk Street, Jack?\"    \"This is it we're in, and that's the place over the way.  Merrett's is  on the first-floor.\"    \"Be sure you wait outside for me,\" said I, preparing to dart over.    \"Yes,\" said he.  \"But, Fred, promise me one thing.\"    \"What?\" said I, hurriedly.    \"Not to show off badly because I'm after the place too.\"    Old Jack!  He gave me credit, I fear, for a good deal more nobleness  than I had a right to claim.    \"All serene,\" said I, \"if you'll promise the same.\"    \"Yes,\" said he.  \"Mind, honour bright, Fred.\"    And so we parted, he to pace up and down the street for a long quarter  of an hour, and I to present myself before the awful presence of Messrs.  Merrett, Barnacle, and Company.    If all the youths who had flocked with me from the station in the  direction of Hawk Street had been bound (as my "]]]
