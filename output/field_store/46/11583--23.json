Ah, but I knew that I had  to deal with clever people--with artists in crime--and it behooved me  to be an artist also. I had good reason to know that their system of  espionage was efficient; and the slipshod way is ever the wrong way.    The unpleasantly sticky letter I returned to my pocket, looking around  me for some means of making up any kind of packet which could do duty  as a substitute. Beyond a certain draped over a recess at one end of  the waiting-room I saw a row of boxes, a box of lint and other medical  paraphernalia. It was the doctor's dispensary. Perhaps I might find  there an envelope.    I crossed the room and looked. Immediately around the corner, on a  level with my eyes, was a packet of foolscap envelopes and a stick of   black sealing-wax! _Bien!_ all that I now required was a stout sheet  of paper to enclose in one of those envelopes. But not a scrap of  paper could I find, except the blood-stained letter in my pocket--  towards which I had formed a strong antipathy. I had not even a  newspaper in my possession. I thought of folding three or four  envelopes, but there were only six in all, and the absence of so  many might be noted.    Drawing aside a baize curtain which hung from the bottom shelf, I  discovered a number of old card-board boxes. It was sufficient. With  a pair of surgical scissors I cut a piece from the lid of one and  thrust it into an envelope, gumming down the lapel. At a little gas  jet intended for the purpose I closed both ends with wax and--  singular coincidence!--finding a Chinese coin fastened to a cork  lying on the shelf, my sense of humour prompted me to use it as a  seal! Finally, to add to the verisimilitude of the affair I borrowed  a pen which rested in a bottle of red ink and wrote upon the  envelope the number: 30, that day being the thirtieth day of the  month.    It was well that the artist within me had dictated this careful  elaboration, as became evident a few minutes later when the doctor  appeared at the head of a short flight of stairs and requested me to  step up to his consulting-room. It was a small room, so that the  window, over which a linen blind was drawn, occupied nearly the whole  of one wall. As Dr. Stuart, having examined the cut on my scalp,  descended to the dispensary for lint, the habits of a lifetime asserted  themselves.    I quickly switched off the light and peeped out of the window around  the edge of the blind, which I drew slightly aside. In the shadow of  the wall upon the opposite side of the narrow lane a man was standing!  I turned on the light again. The watcher should not be disappointed!    My skull being dressed, I broached the subject of the letter, which I  said I had found in my cab after the accident which had caused the  injury.    \"Someone left this behind to-day, sir,\" I said; \"perhaps the gentleman  who was with me when I had the accident; and I've got no means of  tracing him. He may be able to trace _me_, though, or he may advertise.  It evidently contains something valuable. I wonder if you would do me  a small favour? Would you mind taking charge of it for a week or so,  until it is claimed?\"    He asked me why I did not take it to Scotland Yard.    \"Because,\" said I, \"if the owner claims it from Scotland Yard he is  less likely to be generous than if he gets it direct from me!\"    \"But what is the point,\" asked Dr. Stuart, \"in leaving it here?\"    I explained that if _I_ kept the letter I might be suspected of an  intention of stealing it, whereas directly there was any inquiry, he  could certify that I had left it in his charge. He seemed to be  satisfied and asked me to come into his study for a moment. The man  in the lane was probably satisfied, too. I had stood three paces from  the table-lamp all the time, waving the letter about as I talked, and  casting a bold shadow on the linen blind!    The first thing that struck me as I entered the doctor's study was  that the French windows, which opened on a sheltered lawn, were open.  I acted accordingly.    \"You see,\" said Dr. Stuart, \"I am enclosing your letter in this big  envelope which I am sealing.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" I replied, standing at some distance from him, so that he  had to speak loudly. \"And would you mind addressing it to the Lost  Property Office.\"    \"Not at all,\" said he, and did as I suggested. \"If not reclaimed  within a reasonable time, it will be sent to Scotland Yard.\"    I edged nearer to the open window.    \"If it is not reclaimed,\" I said loudly, \"it goes to Scotland Yard--yes.\"    \"Meanwhile,\" concluded the doctor, \"I am locking it in this private  drawer in my bureau.\"    \"It is locked in your bureau. Very good.\"          CHAPTER III    DISAPPEARANCE OF CHARLES MALET      Knowing, and I knew it well, that people of \"The Scorpion\" were  watching, I do not pretend that I felt at my ease as I drove around to  the empty house in which I garaged my cab. My inquiry had entered upon  another stage, and Charles Malet was about to disappear from the case.  I was well aware that if he failed in his vigilance for a single moment  he might well disappear from the world!    The path which led to the stables was overgrown with weeds and flanked  by ragged bushes; weeds and grass sprouted between the stones paving  the little yard, also, although they were withered to a great extent  by the petrol recently spilled there. Having run the cab into the yard,  I alighted and looked around the deserted grounds, mysterious in the  moonlight. Company would have been welcome, but excepting a constable  who had stopped and chatted with me on one or two evenings I always  had the stables to myself at night.    I determined to run the cab into the stable and lock it up without  delay, for it was palpably dangerous in the circumstances to remain  longer than necessary in that lonely spot. Hurriedly I began to put  out the lamps. I unlocked the stable doors and stood looking all about  me again. I was dreading the ordeal of driving the cab those last ten  yards into the garage, for whilst I had my back to the wilderness of  bushes it would be an easy matter for anyone in hiding there to come  up behind me.    Nevertheless, it had to be done. Seating myself at the wheel I drove  into the narrow building, stopped the engine and peered cautiously  around toward the bright square formed by the open doors. Nothing was  to be seen. No shadow moved.    A magazine pistol held in my hand, I crept, step by step, along the  wall until I stood just within the opening. There I stopped.    I could hear a sound of quick breathing! There was someone waiting  outside!    Dropping quietly down upon the pavement, I slowly protruded my head  around the angle of the brick wall at a point not four inches above  the ground. I knew that whoever waited would have his eyes fixed upon  the doorway at the level of a man's head.    Close to the wall, a pistol in his left hand and an upraised  stand-bag in his right, stood \"Le Balafre!\" His eyes gleamed savagely  in the light of the moon and his teeth were bared in that fearful  animal snarl. But he had not seen me.    Inch by inch I thrust my pistol forward, the barrel raised sharply. I  could not be sure of my aim, of course, nor had I time to judge it  carefully.    I fired.    The bullet was meant for his right wrist, but it struck him in the  fleshy part of his arm. Uttering a ferocious cry he leapt back,  dropped his pistol--and perceiving me as I sprang to my feet, lashed  at my head with the sand-bag. I raised my left arm to guard my skull  and sustained the full force of the blow upon it.    I staggered back against the wall, and my own pistol was knocked from  my grasp. My left arm was temporarily useless and the man of the scar  was deprived of the use of his right. _Pardieu!_ I had the better  chance!    He hurled himself upon me.    Instantly he recovered the advantage, for he grasped me by the throat  with his left hand--and, _nom d'un nom!_ what a grip he had! Flat  against the wall he held me, and began, his teeth bared in that  fearful grin, to crush the life from me.    To such an attack there was only one counter. I kicked him savagely--  and that death-grip relaxed. I writhed, twisted--and was free! As I  regained my freedom I struck up at him, and by great good fortune  caught him upon the point of the jaw. He staggered. I struck him over  the heart, and he fell I pounced upon him, exulting, for he had sought  my life and I knew no pity.    Yet I had not thought so strong a man would choke so easily, and for  some moments I stood looking down at him, believing that he sought to  trick me. But it was not so. His affair was finished.    I listened. The situation in which I found myself was full of  difficulty. An owl screeched somewhere in the trees, but nothing else  stirred. The sound of the shot had not attracted attention, apparently.  I stooped and examined the garments of the man who lay at my feet.    He carried a travel coupon to Paris bearing that day's date, together  with some other papers, but, although I searched all his pockets, I  could find nothing of real interest, until in an inside pocket of his  coat I felt some hard, irregularly shaped object. I withdrew it, and  in the moonlight it lay glittering in my palm ... a _golden scorpion!_    It had apparently been broken in the struggle. The tail was missing,  nor could I find it: but I must confess that I did not prolong the  search.    Some chance effect produced by the shadow of the moonlight, and the  presence of that recently purchased ticket, gave me the idea upon  which without delay I proceeded to act. Satisfying myself that there  was no mark upon any of his garments by which the man could be  identified, I unlocked from my wrist an identification disk which I  habitually wore there, and locked it upon the wrist of the man with  the scar!    Clearly, I argued, he had been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#18)"],[1,"18, 1804,  and by Connecticut at its session begun May 10, 1804.
