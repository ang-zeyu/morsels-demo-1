[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20153"],[0,"The American Journal of Archaeology, 1893-1 (#18)"],[1,", is one of long duration.[111] Boeckh           maintained that the Lenaea were a separate festival celebrated           in the month Gamelio. To this opinion August Mommsen in the           _Heortologie_ returns; and maintained as it is by O.           Ribbeck,[112] by Albert Müller,[113] by A.E. Haigh,[114] and by           G. Oehmichen,[115] it may fairly be said to be the accepted           theory to-day. This opinion, however, is by no means           universally received. For example, O. Gilbert[116] has           attempted to prove that the country Dionysia, Lenaea, and           Anthesteria were only parts of the same festival.             [Footnote B: I wish to express my hearty thanks to Prof. U. von           Wilamowitz-Möllendorff of the University of Göttingen, Prof. K.           Schöll of the University of Munich, Prof. A.C.

Akad. der Wiss. zu           Berlin_, 1816-17.]             [Footnote 112: _Die Anfänge und Entwickelung des Dionysoscultus           in Attika._]             [Footnote 113: _Bühnen-Alterthümer._]             [Footnote 114: _The Attic Theatre._]             [Footnote 115: _Das Bühnenwesen der Griechen und Römer._]             [Footnote 116: _Die Festzeit der Attischen Dionysien._]             But while the date of the so-called Lenaea has been so long           open to question, until recently it has been universally held           that some portion at least of all the festivals at Athens in           honor of the wine-god was held in the precinct by the extant           theatre of Dionysus. With the ruins of this magnificent           structure before the eyes, and no other theatre in sight, the           temptation was certainly a strong one to find in this           neighborhood the Limnae mentioned in the records of the           ancients. When Pervanoglu found a handful of rushes in the           neighborhood of the present military hospital, the matter  Page 57  seemed finally settled. So, on the maps and charts of Athens we           find the word _Limnae_ printed across that region lying to the           south of the theatre, beyond the boulevard and the hospital.           When, therefore, _Mythology and Monuments of Athens_, by           Harrison and Verrall, appeared over a year ago, those familiar           with the topography of Athens as laid down by Curtius and           Kaupert were astonished to find, on the little plan facing page           5, that the Limnae had been removed from their time-honored           position and located between the Coloneus Agoraeus and the           Dipylum. That map incited the preparation of the present           article.             While investigating the reasons for and against so           revolutionary a change, the writer has become convinced that           here, Dr. Dörpfeld, the author of the new view, has built upon           a sure foundation. How much in this paper is due to the direct           teaching of Dr. Dörpfeld in the course of his invaluable           lectures _An Ort und Stelle_ on the topography of Athens, I           need not say to those who have listened to his talks. How much           besides he has given to me of both information and suggestion I           would gladly acknowledge in detail; but as this may not always           be possible, I will say now that the views presented here after           several months of study, in the main correspond with those held           by Dr. Dörpfeld. The facts and authorities here cited, and the           reasoning deduced from these, are, however, nearly all results           of independent investigation. So I shall content myself in           general with presenting the reasons which have led me to my own           conclusions; for it would require a volume to set forth all the           arguments of those who hold opposing views.             The passage Thucydides, II. 15, is the authority deemed most           weighty for the placing of the Limnae to the south of the           Acropolis. The question of the location of this section of           Athens is so intimately connected with the whole topography of           the ancient city, that it cannot be treated by itself. I quote           therefore the entire passage:             [Greek:           to de pro toutou e acropolis e nun ousa polis en kai to up'           auten pros noton malista tetrammenon. tecmerion de. ta gar           iera en aute te acropolei kai allôn pheôn esti, kai ta exô pros           touto to meros tes poleôs mallon iorutai, to te tou Dios tou           Olympiou, kai to Pythion, kai ta tes Ges, kai to en Limnais           Dionysou, ô ta archaiotera Dionysia te dodecate poieitai en meni           Anthesteriôni. ôsper kai oi ap' Athenaiôn Iônes eti kai nun  Page 58  nomixousin. idrutai de kai alla iera taute archaia. kai te crene           te nen men tôn turannôn autô okeuasautôn Enneacrounô kaloumene           to de palai phanerôn tôn pegôn ousôn Kallirron ônomasmene           ekeien te eggus ouse ta pleistou exia echrônto, kai nun eti apo           tou archaiou pra te gamicôn kai alla tôn ierôn nomixetai tô           udati chresthai.]             Two assumptions are made from this text by those who place the           Limnae by the extant theatre. The first is that [Greek: up'           auten] includes the whole of the extensive section to the south           of the Acropolis extending to the Ilissus, and reaching to the           east far enough to include the existing Olympieum, with the           Pythium and Callirrhoe, which lay near. The second assumption           is that these are the particular localities mentioned under the           [Greek: tekmerion de]. Let us see if this is not stretching           [Greek: up' auten] a little. I will summarize, so far as may be           necessary for our present purpose, the views of Dr. Dörpfeld on           the land lying [Greek: upo ten acropolin], or the Pelasgicum.             That the Pelasgicum was of considerable size is known from the           fact that it was one of the sacred precincts occupied when the           people came crowding in from the country at the beginning of           the Peloponnesian War,[117] and from the inscription[118] which           forbade that stone should be quarried in or carried from the           precinct, or that earth should be removed therefrom. That the           Pelasgicum with its nine gates was on the south, west, and           southwest slopes, the formation of the Acropolis rock proves,           since it is only here that the Acropolis can be ascended           easily. That it should include all that position of the           hillside between the spring in the Aesculapieum on the south           and the Clepsydra on the northwest, was necessary; for in the           space thus included lay the springs which formed the source of           the water-supply for the fortifications. That the citadel was           divided into two parts, the Acropolis proper, and the           Pelasgicum, we know.[119] One of the two questions in each of           the two passages from Aristophanes refers to the Acropolis, and           the other to the Pelasgicum, and the two are mentioned as parts           of the citadel. That the Pelasgicum actually did extend from           the Aesculapieum to the Clepsydra we know from Lucian.[120]             [Footnote 117: THUCYDEDES, II. 17.]             [Footnote 118: DITTENBERGER, _S. I. G._ 13, 55 ff.]             [Footnote 119: THUCYDEDES, II. 17; ARISTOPHANES, _Birds_, 829           ff.; _Lysistrata_, 480 ff.]             [Footnote 120: _Piscator_, 42.]    Page 59  The people are represented as coming up to the Acropolis in           crowds, filling the road. The way becoming blocked by numbers,           in their eagerness they begin to climb up by ladders, first           from he Pelasgicum itself, through which the road passes. As           this space became filled, they placed their ladders a little           further from the road, in the Aesculapieum to the right and by           the Areopagus to the left. Still others come, and they must           move still further out to find room, to the grave of Talos           beyond the Aesculapieum and to the Anaceum beyond the           Areopagus. In another passage of Lucian,[121] Hermes declares           that Pan dwells just above the Pelasgicum; so it reached at           least as far as Pan's grotto.             [Footnote 121: _Bis Accus_, 9.]             The fortifications of Mycenæ and Tiryns prove that it was not           uncommon in ancient Greek cities to divide the Acropolis, the           most ancient city, into an upper and a lower citadel.             Finally, that the strip of hillside in question was in fact the           Pelasgicum, we are assured by the existing foundations of the           ancient walls. A Pelasgic wall extends as a boundary-wall below           the Aesculapieum, then onward at about the same level until           interrupted by the Odeum of Herodes Atticus. At this point           there are plain indications that before the construction of           this building, this old wall extended across the space now           occupied by the auditorium. Higher up the hill behind the           Odeum, and both within and without the Beulé gate, we find           traces of still other walls which separated the terraces of the           Pelasgicum and probably contained the nine gates which           characterized it. Here then we have the ancient city of           Cecrops, the city before Theseus, consisting of the Acropolis           and the part close beneath,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2016"],[0,"The 1998 CIA World Factbook (#18)"],[1,"rs: US 22%, Japan 17%, UK 6%, China 5%, NZ 5% (1994/95)    Debt-external: $150 billion (December 1996)    Economic aid:  donor: ODA, $1.43 billion (FY97/98)    Currency: 1 Australian dollar ($A) = 100 cents    Exchange rates: Australian dollars ($A) per US$1-1.4865 (February  1998), (1.3439 (1997), 1.2773 (1996), 1.3486 (1995), 1.3668 (1994),  1.4704 (1993)    Fiscal year: 1 July-30 June    Communications    Telephones: 8.7 million (1987 est.)
