Great tracts of mud, difficult to describe as either solid or  liquid, marshes dotted here and there with sandy islets, bristling with  papyrus reeds, water-lilies, and enormous plants through which the arms  of the Nile sluggishly pushed their ever-shifting course, low-lying  wastes intersected with streams and pools, unfit for cultivation  and scarcely available for pasturing cattle. The population of such  districts, engaged in a ceaseless struggle with nature, always preserved  relatively ruder manners, and a more rugged and savage character,  impatient of all authority. The conquest of this region began from the  outer edge only. A few principalities were established at the apex of  the Delta in localities where the soil had earliest been won from the  river. It appears that one of these divisions embraced the country  south of and between the bifurcation of the Nile: Aunu of the North,  the Heliopolis of the Greeks, was its capital. In very early times the  principality was divided, and formed three new states, independent of  each other. Those of Aunu and the Haunch were opposite to each other,  the first on the Arabian, the latter on the Libyan bank of the Nile. The  district of the White Wall marched with that of the Haunch on the north,  and on the south touched the territory of the Oleander. Further down the  river, between the more important branches, the governors of Sai's and  of Bubastis, of Athribis and of Busiris, shared among themselves the  primitive Delta. Two frontier provinces of unequal size, the Arabian on  the east in the Wady Tumilat, and the Libyan on the west to the south of  Lake Mareotis, defended the approaches of the country from the attacks  of Asiatic Bedawins and of African nomads. The marshes of the interior  and the dunes of the littoral, were not conducive to the development of  any great industry or civilization. They only comprised tracts of thinly  populated country, like the principalities of the Harpoon and of the  Cow, and others whose limits varied from century to century with  the changing course of the river. The work of rendering the marshes  salubrious and of digging canals, which had been so successful in the  Nile Valley, was less efficacious in the Delta, and proceeded more  slowly. Here the embankments were not supported by a mountain chain:  they were continued at random across the marshes, cut at every turn to  admit the waters of a canal or of an arm of the river. The waters left  their usual bed at the least disturbing influence, and made a fresh  course for themselves across country. If the inundation were delayed,  the soft and badly drained soil again became a slough: should it last  but a few weeks longer than usual, the work of several generations was  for a long time undone. The Delta of one epoch rarely presented the same  aspect as that of previous periods, and Northern Egypt never became as  fully mistress of her soil as the Egypt of the south.    [Illustration: 099.jpg NOMES OF LOWER EGYPT]    These first principalities, however small they appear to us, were yet  too large to remain undivided. In those times of slow communication, the  strong attraction which a capital exercised over the provinces under its  authority did not extend over a wide radius. That part of the population  of the Terebinth, living sufficiently near to Siut to come into the town  for a few hours in the morning, returning in the evening to the villages  when business was done, would not feel any desire to withdraw from the  rule of the prince who governed there. On the other hand, those who  lived outside that restricted circle were forced to seek elsewhere some  places of assembly to attend the administration of justice, to sacrifice  in common to the national gods, and to exchange the produce of the  fields and of local manufactures. Those towns which had the good fortune  to become such rallying-points naturally played the part of rivals to  the capital, and their chiefs, with the district whose population, so  to speak, gravitated around them, tended to become independent of the  prince. When they succeeded in doing this, they often preserved for the  new state thus created, the old name, slightly modified by the addition  of an epithet. The primitive territory of Siut was in this way divided  into three distinct communities; two, which remained faithful to the old  emblem of the tree--the Upper Terebinth, with Siut itself in the centre,  and the Lower Terebinth, with Kusit to the north; the third, in the  south and east, took as their totem the immortal serpent which dwelt in  their mountains, and called themselves the Serpent Mountain, whose  chief town was that of the Sparrow Hawk. The territory of the Oleander  produced by its dismemberment the principality of the Upper Oleander,  that of the Lower Oleander, and that of the Knife. The territory of  the Harpoon in the Delta divided itself into the Western and Eastern  Harpoon. The fission in most cases could not have been accomplished  without struggles; but it did take place, and all the principalities  having a domain of any considerable extent had to submit to it, however  they may have striven to avoid it. This parcelling out was continued as  circumstances afforded opportunity, until the whole of Egypt, except the  half desert districts about the cataract, became but an agglomeration of  petty states nearly equal in power and population.[*]         * Examples of the subdivision of ancient nomes and the       creation of fresh nomes are met with long after primitive       times. We find, for example, the nome of the Western Harpoon       divided under the Greeks and Romans into two districts--that       of the Harpoon proper, of which the chief town was Sonti-       nofir; and that of Ranunr, with the Onuphis of classical       geographers for its capital.    The Greeks called them nomes, and we have borrowed the word from them;  the natives named them in several ways, the most ancient term  being \"nuit,\" which may be translated _domain_, and the most common  appellation in recent times being \"hospu,\" which signifies _district_.  The number of the nomes varied considerably in the course of centuries:  the hieroglyphic monuments and classical authors fixed them sometimes at  thirty-six, sometimes at forty, sometimes at forty-four, or even fifty.  The little that we know of their history, up to the present time,  explains the reason of this variation. Ceaselessly quarrelled over by  the princely families who possessed them, the nomes were alternately  humbled and exalted by civil wars, marriages, and conquest, which caused  them continually to pass into fresh hands, either entire or divided. The  Egyptians, whom we are accustomed to consider as a people respecting  the established order of things, and conservative of ancient tradition,  showed themselves as restless and as prone to modify or destroy the work  of the past, as the most inconstant of our modern nations. The distance  of time which separates them from us, and the almost complete absence  of documents, gives them an appearance of immobility, by which we are  liable to be unconsciously deceived; when the monuments still existing  shall have been unearthed, their history will present the same  complexity of incidents, the same agitations, the same instability,  which we suspect or know to have been characteristic of most other  Oriental nations. One thing alone remained stable among them in the  midst of so many revolutions, and which prevented them from losing their  individuality and from coalescing in a common unity. This was the belief  in and the worship of one particular deity. If the little capitals  of the petty states whose origin is lost in a remote past--Edfu and  Denderah, Nekhabit and Buto, Siufc, Thinis, Khmunu, Sais, Bubastis,  Athribis--had only possessed that importance which resulted from the  presence of an ambitious petty prince, or from the wealth of their  inhabitants, they would never have passed safe and sound through the  long centuries of existence which they enjoyed from the opening to the  close of Egyptian history. Fortune raised their chiefs, some even to the  rank of rulers of the world, and in turn abased them: side by side with  the earthly ruler, whose glory was but too often eclipsed, there was  enthroned in each nome a divine ruler, a deity, a god of the domain,  \"nutir nuiti,\" whose greatness never perished. The princely families  might be exiled or become extinct, the extent of the territory might  diminish or increase, the town might be doubled in size and population  or fall in ruins: the god lived on through all these vicissitudes, and  his presence alone preserved intact the rights of the state over which  he reigned as sovereign. If any disaster befell his worshippers, his  temple was the spot where the survivors of the catastrophe rallied  around him, their religion preventing them from mixing with the  inhabitants of neighbouring towns and from becoming lost among them.  The survivors multiplied with that extraordinary rapidity which is the  characteristic of the Egyptian fellah, and a few years of peace sufficed  to repair losses which apparently were irreparable. Local religion  was the tie which bound together those divers elements of which each  principality was composed, and as long as it remained, the nomes  remained; when it vanished, they disappeared with it.

The dropping  plate is concaved around its dropping holes, and is provided with a  plate that may be adjusted to cover one set of dropping holes to drop  the hills twice as far apart as when both sets of holes operate.      IMPROVED ANIMAL TRAP.    Thomas N. Hughes, Muddy Creek, Tenn.--This trap is for animals of all  kinds, as rats, mice, and larger animals, as foxes, minks, coons,  etc., that are allured by bait, and is automatically set again by the  animal caught, to be ready for the next animal attracted by the bait.  It is divided by a longitudinal partition into two main sections, in  which the working parts are disposed. The entrance at the end of one  section has a drop door, which is arranged back of the same, resting,  when closed, on side strips in inclined position, and being supported  on an upright arm, of a centrally pivoted treadle door, at the bottom  of the trap, when the trap is set. The treadle door is only required  to swing sufficiently on its pivots to release the drop door from the  arm, suitable seats at the under side of the trap, at both sides of  the treadle door, preventing the door from swinging farther than  necessary. The bait is placed, in a grated receptacle, near the  treadle door, and entices the animal to pass in, so as to close the  drop door when it arrives at the part of the treadle door near the  bait. The back end of this section is perforated or grated to admit  light, which attracts the frightened animal and induces him to pass  toward the light. The top part of the trap may be grated to admit air,  and the glass door at the end made to slide, to admit the taking out  of the animals for killing them.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS.      APPARATUS FOR THE HYDRATION OF CHLORINE GAS.    William Maynard, New York city.--This invention relates to an improved  construction of apparatus for the hydration of gases, and more  particularly chlorine gas for the manufacture of chlorine water for  use in the industrial arts of bleaching, etc. It consists mainly in a  case having an inlet for the water above, an inlet for the gas below,  and provided with an intermediate water percolating medium; combined  with a reservoir located below the level of the case and having a  water-sealed communication therewith, which reservoir receives the  hydrated gases, and which water seal prevents the heavy gas in the  case from passing out through the bottom inlet. The case for the  percolation of water and the absorption of the gas is made of conical  shape, with the largest diameter at the bottom, to produce the  greatest absorption of the heavy gas when first admitted; while  horizontal partitions, or shelves, in said case are provided with  upwardly projecting tubes which hold a permanent surface of water on  the said partition or shelves. The tubes permit, by their peculiar  shape, the water to pass down on one side and the gas up on the  opposite side of said tube, while their alternating arrangement in the  alternating shelves gives a zigzag and long continued passage to the  gas and water in moving in opposite directions through the case.      IMPROVED PROCESS OF PREPARING GAS FUEL.    Martin N. Diall, Terre Haute, Ind.--This inventor saturates wood by  immersing it in any hydrocarbon oil for from six to twelve hours, as  required by the nature of the wood, so that it may take up the  necessary quantity of oil for the required strength of gas. The wood  is then immersed in a bath of water, for taking up a quantity of water  outside the oil, and is then charged in the retorts, the same as coal,  and distilled in the same way. By this process the inventor claims  that he produces fixed gas equal to coal gas, much faster, and with  less expense, the wood and water furnishing the hydrogen, and the oil  furnishing the carbon.      IMPROVED FISHING LINE LEADER.    Welmer T. Jahne and Anthony Moors, Jersey City, N.J.--This consists of  a leader made of spring wire, bent into V form, provided with a swivel  and eye at its middle part, and with eyes or loops at its ends to  receive the line and snells. By this construction the snells and hooks  will be kept apart however the line maybe thrown, and however they and  the leader may be turned about by the tide or current. The device is  one well calculated to meet with a favorable reception from fishermen.      IMPROVED ABDOMINAL CORSET.    Christina Lascell, Newark, N.J.--The object of this invention is to  furnish an improved abdominal corset, which supports the weight of the  abdomen in a perfectly comfortable and easy manner, and throws the  strain on the shoulders and hips of the wearer. The corset is  adjustable to the varying conditions of the abdomen, does not  interfere with the motion and different positions of the body, and is  readily put on and taken off. It has adjustable elastic shoulder  straps, and opening at the sides by lacings and elastic bands and  buttons. The front part of the corset is stiffened by a stay that  slides in a pocket to provide for stooping. A central front and lacing  admit the front part of the corset to expand. The lower extension part  of the corset has short stiffening stays, and it is connected  independently of the upper stays by short side lacing and elastic  straps to the side or hip parts of the corset. A hernial band extends  from the lowermost part of the corset-extension between the legs to  the rear, and is attached by adjustable hip straps to the sides of the  corset.      IMPROVED FIRE ESCAPE.    John F. Werner, New York city.--The terrible disaster in the Brooklyn  theater is serving as a stimulus to induce the invention of devices  looking to the prevention of a like occurrence. The present inventor  has devised a new fire escape for theaters, concert halls, and other  public places of amusement, by which the space at the upper parts of  the entrances, halls, or vestibules of the buildings is utilized for  the purpose of forming additional passage ways for the persons in the  buildings, to be used in case of fire for the more convenient and less  dangerous exit of the same. The invention consists, mainly, of a  movable floor, suspended by chains, pulleys, and weights, near the  ceiling of the entrances, and lowered in case of fire. It is supported  on projecting rests of the side walls, at suitable height above the  floor. Sliding extensions and swinging stairs and rear sections  connect with the ground outside of the door, and with the staircases  of the gallery, so as to form separate exits above the regular  entrances.      IMPROVED ELECTRO-MAGNETIC DENTAL PLUGGER.    James E. Dexter, New York city.--This invention consists, first, in a  magnet having a centrally bored iron core, surrounded by a magnetic  coil, which is enveloped by an iron shell that is concentric with the  central core, and is attached to a flange formed on the lower end of  the said central core. One side of both shell and core are split for  the purpose of obviating residual magnetism. The invention also  consists in combining a spring yoke, a vibrator, and a spring contact  piece, as hereinafter particularly described. The third part of this  invention consists in the arrangement of the key for completing the  circuit, which is made with an insulating exterior, and is provided  with one of the termini of the magnet coil, and bears against the side  of the key to insure a constant contact of the surfaces. The various  parts of the plugger are combined, so that pressing the key with the  finger makes the circuit, and a succession of regular strokes is  produced, the force of which may be varied by an adjusting screw.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW MECHANICAL AND ENGINEERING INVENTIONS.      IMPROVED COTTON GIN.    Joseph W. Thorn, Iuka, Miss., assignor to himself and M.W. Beardsley,  of same place.--In this machine there is a new construction of the  brush drum for simplifying the same, and facilitating the application  of the brush wings, so that they can be readily taken off and put on;  also, an arrangement of the ribs between the saws for facilitating the  separating of the seed from the cotton without breaking and injuring  the fiber. There are also ingenious devices for preventing the seed  from gathering and clogging at the ends of the saw drum.      IMPROVED SAFETY CHECK FOR ELEVATORS.    Nathan H. Fogg, Boston, Mass.--When the car is suspended normally from  the rope, the rubber balls, arranged in sockets near the lower part of  the car, are supported on their seats in a state of rest; but the  instant that the rope breaks or gets detached from the bolt the action  of a spiral spring throws an actuating plate downward, and levers and  ball-carrying rods upward. The balls are thus thrown off their seats  and wedged between the inclined sides of the pockets and the guide  posts of the elevator so as to stop thereby the car.      IMPROVED COMBINATION LOCK.    Achille Parise, Naples, Italy.--This is a new combination lock for  doors, trunks, safes, etc., that admits of a large number of  combinations, and may be opened and closed quickly. It consists of  sliding tumbler plates, having longitudinal slots and a number of  perforations placed at different relative positions to the slots of  each tumbler. The trunks are connected by screw set pins attached to  face slides, and passing through any one of the perforations,  admitting the setting of the tumblers and opening of the lock by outer  projections or buttons of the slides to fixed exterior guides.      IMPROVED MACHINE FOR WIRING AND BINDING HATS.    Mari A. Cuming and Judson Knight, New York city.--This is a machine  for binding hats, felt skirts, and similar articles, by a uniform "]]]
