This is accomplished by alternately  compressing and enlarging the thorax by means of variable pressure on the  outside, imitating the natural process as nearly as possible. Following is  the method proposed by Professor E.A. Schaffer of England, and called by  him \"the _prone-posture_ method of artificial respiration\":    The patient is laid face downward with an arm bent under the head, and  _intermittent_ pressure applied vertically over the shortest ribs. The  pressure drives the air from the lungs, both by compressing the lower  portions of the chest and by forcing the abdominal contents against the  diaphragm, while the elastic reaction of the parts causes fresh air to  enter (Figs. 47 and 48). \"The operator kneels or squats by the side of, or  across the patient, places his hands over the lowest ribs and swings his  body backward and forward so as to allow his weight to fall vertically on  the wrists and then to be removed; in this way hardly any muscular  exertion is required.... The pressure is applied gradually and slowly,  occupying some three seconds; it is then withdrawn during two seconds and  again applied; and so on some twelve times per minute.\"(39)                                    [Fig. 48]                     Fig. 48--Artificial respiration. Inspiration.      The special advantages of the prone-posture method over others that have  been employed are: I. It may be applied by a single individual and fora  long period of time without exhaustion. 2. It allows the mucus and water  (in case of drowning) to run out of the mouth, and causes the tongue to  fall forward so as not to obstruct the passageway. 3. It brings a  sufficient amount of air into the lungs.(40)    While applying artificial respiration, the heat of the body should not be  allowed to escape any more than can possibly be helped. In case of  drowning, the patient should be wrapped in dry blankets or clothing, while  bottles of hot water may be placed in contact with the body. The  circulation should be stimulated, as may be done by rubbing the hands,  feet, or limbs in the direction of the flow of the blood in the veins.    *Tobacco Smoke and the Air* Passages.--Smoke consists of minute particles  of unburnt carbon, or soot, such as collect in the chimneys of fireplaces  and furnaces. If much smoke is taken into the lungs, it irritates the  delicate linings and tends to clog them up. Tobacco smoke also contains  the poison nicotine, which is absorbed into the blood. For these reasons  the cigarette user who inhales the smoke does himself great harm, injuring  his nervous system and laying the foundation for diseases of the air  passages. The practice of smoking indoors is likewise objectionable, since  every one in a room containing the smoke is compelled to breathe it.    *Alcohol and Diseases of the Lungs.*--Pneumonia is a serious disease of the  lungs caused by germs. The attacks occur as a result of exposure,  especially when the body is in a weakened condition. A noted authority  states that \"alcoholism is perhaps the most potent predisposing cause\" of  pneumonia.(41) A person addicted to the use of alcohol is also less likely  to recover from the disease than one who has avoided its use, a result due  in part to the weakening effect of alcohol upon the heart. The congestion  of the lungs in pneumonia makes it very difficult for the heart to force  the blood through them. The weakened heart of the drunkard gives way under  the task.    The statement sometimes made that alcohol is beneficial in pulmonary  tuberculosis is without foundation in fact. On the other hand, alcoholism  is a recognized cause of consumption. Some authorities claim that this  disease is more frequent in heavy drinkers than in those of temperate  habits, in the proportion of about three to one, and that possibly half of  the cases of tuberculosis are traceable to alcoholism.(42)    *The Outdoor Cure for Lung Diseases*--Among the many remedies proposed for  consumption and kindred diseases, none have proved more beneficial,  according to reports, than the so-called \"outdoor\" cure. The person having  consumption is fed plentifully upon the most nourishing food, and is made  to spend practically his entire time, including the sleeping hours, _out  of doors_. Not only is this done during the pleasant months of summer, but  also during the winter when the temperature is below freezing. Severe  exposure is prevented by overhead protection at night and by sufficient  clothing to keep the body warm. The abundant supply of pure, cold air  toughens the lungs and invigorates the entire body, thereby enabling it to  throw off the disease.    The success attending this method of treating consumptives suggests the  proper mode of strengthening lungs that are not diseased, but simply weak.  The person having weak lungs should spend as much time as he conveniently  can out of doors. He should provide the most ample ventilation at night  and have a sleeping room to himself. He should practice deep breathing  exercises and partake of a nourishing diet. While avoiding prolonged  chilling and other conditions liable to induce colds, he should take  advantage of every opportunity of exposing himself fully and freely to the  outside atmosphere.    *Summary.*--The purpose of respiration is to bring about an exchange of  gases between the body and the atmosphere. The organs employed for this  purpose, called the respiratory organs, are adapted to handling materials  in the _gaseous_ state, and are operated in accordance with principles  governing the movements of the atmosphere. By alternately increasing and  diminishing the thoracic space, air is made to pass between the outside  atmosphere and the interior of the lungs. Finding its way into the  smallest divisions of the lungs, called the alveoli, the air comes very  near a large surface of blood. By this means the carbon dioxide diffuses  out of the blood, and the free oxygen enters. Through the combined action  of the organs of respiration and the organs that move the blood and the  lymph, the cells in all parts of the body are enabled to exchange certain  gaseous materials with the outside atmosphere.                                    [Fig. 49]                      Fig. 49--Model for demonstrating the lungs.      *Exercises.--*1. How does air entering the lungs differ in composition from  air leaving the lungs? What purposes of respiration are indicated by these  differences?    2. Name the divisions of the lungs.    3. Trace air from the outside atmosphere into the alveoli. Trace the blood  from the right ventricle to the alveoli and back again to the left  auricle.    4. How does the movement of air into and from the lungs differ from that  of the blood through the lungs with respect to (_a_) the direction of the  motion. (_b_) the causes of the motion, and (_c_) the tubes through which  the motion takes place?    5. How are the air passages kept clean and open?    6. Describe the pleura. Into what divisions does it separate the thoracic  cavity?    7. Describe and name uses of the diaphragm.    8. If 30 cubic inches of air are passed into the lungs at each inspiration  and .05 of this is retained as oxygen, calculate the number of cubic feet  of oxygen consumed each day, if the number of inspirations be 18 per  minute.    9. Find the _weight_ of a day's supply of oxygen, as found in the above  problem, allowing 1.3 ounces as the weight of a cubic foot.    10. Make a study of the hygienic ventilation of the schoolroom.    11. Give advantages of full breathing over shallow breathing.    12. How may a flat chest and round shoulders be a cause of consumption?  How may these deformities be corrected?    13. Give general directions for applying artificial respiration.        PRACTICAL WORK      Examine a dissectible model of the chest and its contents (Fig. 49). Note  the relative size of the two lungs and their position with reference to  the heart and diaphragm. Compare the side to side and vertical diameters  of the cavity. Trace the air tubes from the trachea to their smallest  divisions.    *Observation of Lungs* (Optional).--Secure from a butcher the lungs of a  sheep, calf, or hog. The windpipe and heart should be left attached and  the specimen kept in a moist condition until used. Demonstrate the  trachea, bronchi, and the bronchial tubes, and the general arrangement of  pulmonary arteries and veins. Examine the pleura and show lightness of  lung tissue by floating a piece on water.    *To show the Changes that Air undergoes in the Lungs.*--1. Fill a quart jar  even full of water. Place a piece of cardboard over its mouth and invert,  without spilling, in a pan of water. Inserting a tube under the jar, blow  into it air that has been held as long as possible in the lungs. When  filled with air, remove the jar from the pan, keeping the top well  covered. Slipping the cover slightly to one side, insert a burning  splinter and observe that the flame is extinguished. This proves the  absence of sufficient oxygen to support combustion. Pour in a little  limewater(43) and shake to mix with the air. The change of the limewater  to a milky white color proves the presence of carbon dioxide.                                    [Fig. 50]       Fig. 50--*Apparatus* for showing changes which air undergoes while in the                                    lungs.      2. The effects illustrated in experiment 1 may be shown in a somewhat more  striking manner as follows: Fill two bottles of the same size each one  fourth full of limewater and fit each with a two-holed rubber stopper  (Fig. 50). Fit into each stopper one short and one long glass tube, the  long tube extending below the limewater. Connect the short tube of one  bottle and the long tube of the other bottle with a Y-tube.

Such books use  the word _larva_ only in speaking of the young of insects that undergo a  complete metamorphosis.    Yes, Ned, they would speak of the nymph of the dragon fly, and the nymph  of the May fly and the nymph of the cricket and the katydid, but they  would speak of the larva of the corydalus.    Egg, nymph, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have an  incomplete metamorphosis.    Egg, larva, pupa, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have a  complete metamorphosis.    No, it is not wrong to say larva instead of nymph. I only want you to  know how the word nymph is used, so that when you see it in reading  about insects you will know what it means.    The corydalus lays its eggs near the water, and it lays a great  many--sometimes nearly three thousand. Think of that! The young larvae  crawl into the water as soon as they are hatched, and those that escape  the hungry fishes grow into these large larvae and finally metamorphose  into the big-horned corydalus.    It is such a remarkably fierce-looking creature that it has received  many names that are neither complimentary nor beautiful, such as  conniption bug, alligator, and dragon, and numerous others equally  expressive.    Now, we must go home. Let us put the dobson back into the brook.    It does no harm, and we will not kill it.    Yes, Ned, there are smaller insects like the corydalus that are near  relatives to it, and I am sure you have often seen them.          FAIRY LACEWING      Here is our little Lacewing.    [Illustration]    May says it is a darling, like a woodland fairy clad all in green.    And, oh, its eyes! Are they not beautiful? They shine like gold.    Do its wings not remind you a little of the wings of the corydalus?    May says no, indeed; that has ugly brown wings.    But look again, May. See how these wings are veined, and do you not  remember how you admired the silvery wings of the corydalus when we  spread them out?    Yes, it belongs to the same order as the corydalus.    The name of the insect order to which they both belong is Neuroptera,  from _neuron_, a nerve, and _pteron_--who remembers what _pteron_ means?    Yes, a wing. Nerve-winged.    What does that mean?    It means that the wings are crossed by many nerves or veins. Yes, that  is what gives them their lacelike appearance.    Pretty golden eye, why do we not oftener see you on the trees and  bushes? It is only by accident we found you to-day, down in the grass.    The truth is, this pretty fairy hides by day and comes out at night to  lay its eggs. Like the May fly, the adult lacewing does not eat. It is a  helpless little beauty, though it has one powerful means of defence, as  you will discover if you touch it.    Ah, yes; you have already detected it! It gives forth such an offensive  odor that nothing, one should think, could have the hardihood to eat it.    May says she supposes the larva of the lacewing is a little monster like  that of the corydalus.    But you will not expect to find it as large as a dobson.    I think if we hunt about a little, we can find one.    Here is one on the leaf. See what a little fellow! And how fast it runs!    [Illustration]    We shall have to take it captive, in order to get a chance to see it.    It is a funny little larva, with jaws that are _tre-men-dous_ for one of  its size.    Why do you suppose it has such jaws?    May says, for the usual reason, to eat up other larvae.    Yes; but wait till I tell you another name for this larva.    It is also called the aphis lion.    Aphis, you know, is the same as aphid, or plant louse. In other words it  is the plant-louse lion.    Ah, yes; you are quite willing it should devour the aphids.    And it does. It is very fond of them, though it will also devour any  unlucky insect it is strong enough to overcome.    It has a terrible appetite, this child of the pretty lacewing.    It would even eat its brothers and sisters before they hatched out of  the egg if it could get at them.    The pretty lacewing knows what an appetite her ever hungry larvae will  have, and so she protects them against each other.    Clever little mother! she lays the eggs in such a way that the larvae  that hatch out first cannot devour the rest of the eggs.    How do you think she manages it?    Here are some of her eggs on this leaf.    Yes, John; each one is on top of a slender stalk.    The stalk is of stiff silk.    There they are, like a little forest, with an egg for each tree top.    [Illustration]    When an egg hatches the young aphis lion drops down to the leaf and runs  about like a ravening lion seeking some living thing to devour.    Above his head, quite unsuspected by him, are the eggs out of which his  brothers and sisters have not yet hatched.    What a feast he could have if he knew about it!    And what a sad little cannibal he would be!    The larva of the aphis lion has no distinct thorax. Its legs are  attached to the upper segments of the body, and its metamorphosis is  like that of the corydalus.    When about to become a pupa, it makes for itself a little covering of  white silk. Here it lies quite motionless and undergoes the final  transformation.    Yes, its metamorphosis is complete.    It bites an opening through its silken walls, and out steps--not the  hungry, little, all-devouring aphis lion, but this elegant lady with her  pale-green lacelike wings and her large, golden eyes.    You see the aphis lion is our very good friend.    It helps us get rid of the aphids, and we should never kill a lacewing  or a child of the lacewing.          THE ANT LION      John has found something he wants us all to see.    We will go with him.    Now we will sit down on this sand bank and look at what he has to show  us. See! those smooth little funnels in the sand.    [Illustration]    Those are what we have come out to see.    Let us watch them a while.    Mollie says an ant is walking close to the rim of the funnel she is  watching. Now the ant slips over the edge and slides down the smooth  sides of the funnel.    And see! from the bottom of the funnel leap out two curved jaws  and--good-by, ant!    The ant has been dragged down out of sight through a hole in the bottom  of the funnel.    What a strange proceeding!    Who can be living down there at the bottom of the funnel?    We are sorry to disturb such a pretty piece of work, but we shall have  to dig out one of the funnels. We shall have to be quick, too.    There, there, under the trowel! No, it is gone. There it is again. Dig  fast, Ned. That is right. He has put it with a trowelful of sand into  our box.    We will gently shake out the sand until we uncover it.    Mabel says it is just what she thought it was--a larva.    Yes, it is a larva.    [Illustration]    You see it looks a little like the lacewing larva, and it, too, belongs  to the Neuroptera.    What jaws!    How do you suppose it makes its tunnel?    If we give it plenty of sand, and keep very quiet, perhaps it will go to  work.    There! it is throwing the sand about.    May says it is using its own head as a trowel. Yes, it is shovelling the  sand away with its head.    Why is Ned laughing? Oh, see the ant lion he is watching! An ant slid  part way down its funnel and tried to climb out again, and the ant lion  down below is flinging sand at it.    There! it has succeeded in making the poor ant slip; down it goes, and  now the ant lion has seized it and dragged it down under the ground.    It is easy to find these pit-falls of the ant lion in sand banks in the  summer-time.    Yes, May, the ant lions eat many ants, and they moult and grow, and,  finally, they, too, make a little cocoon about themselves.    Yes, the little silken room they weave we call a cocoon, but the ant  lions make theirs of silk and sand.    [Illustration]    Within the cocoon they become motionless pupae, and finally appear as  silver-winged little creatures that bear no resemblance to the  large-jawed, ever hungry, ant lion.    May says she thinks the Neuroptera differ from all the other orders in  the way the larvae transform.    That is true, May, they do.    In no other order that we have studied do the insects go into the pupal  state to undergo the final transformation.    Who remembers what the young of insects that undergo an incomplete  metamorphosis are sometimes called?    Dear me, you all remember!    Yes, the young are sometimes called nymphs.    The nymphs do not change into pupae.    The young grasshoppers do not change into motionless pupae, they just  keep on growing until they are perfect adults.    Young grasshoppers are sometimes called nymphs instead of larvae.    [Illustration]          THE LITTLE CADDICE FLIES      Here we are in the woods again.    How sweet it smells!    Let us sit down by this brook and look into it.    It is such a clear little stream, with fine sand and little pebbles at  the bottom.    What has Nell found that pleases her so?    She says she sees some little bars of sand moving about.    Ned says they are not sand bars but tubes of sand, containing a little  live thing.    The truth is, this sand bag is a house, and its occupant is a larva.    [Illustration]    See the black head come popping out, and the tiny fore legs.    The larva does not come entirely out, you see, but pulls its house along  with it, and when it is frightened it pops back into its little stone  case.    Mollie says it reminds her of a hermit crab.    A hermit crab, you know, lives on the seashore and takes possession of  an empty snail shell for a house.    It comes partly out dragging its house with it, but if you disturb it,  it draws back, sometimes quite out of sight.    [Illustration]    This little larva lives in a house, too, but it is a house of its own  making.    It is the larva of the caddice fly, or case fly.    Let us put one of these little sand cases in the saucer here.    Please fill the saucer about half full of water, "]]]
