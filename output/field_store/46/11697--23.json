He did not think of the possibility of lurking sea monsters as he  plunged into the water, swam for the canoe edging along the reef,  plainly bound for the sea gate to the southwest. Shann was not a  powerful swimmer. His first impetus gave him a good start, but after  that he had to fight for each foot he gained, and the fear grew in him  that the other would reach the reef passage before he could catch up. He  wasted no more time trying to hail Thorvald, putting all his breath and  energy into the effort of overtaking the craft.    And he almost made it, his hand actually slipping along the log which  furnished the balancing outrigger. As his fingers tightened on the slimy  wood he looked up, and loosed that hold again in time perhaps to save  his life.    For when he ducked to let the water cover his head in an impromptu half  dive, Shann carried with him a vivid picture, a picture so astounding  that he was a little dazed.    Thorvald had stopped paddling at last, because that paddle had to be put  to another use. Had Shann not released his hold on the log and gone  under water, that crudely fashioned piece of wood might, have broken his  skull. He saw only too clearly the paddle raised in both hands as an  ugly weapon, and Thorvald's face, convulsed in a spasm of rage which  made it as inhuman as a Throg's.    Sputtering and choking, Shann fought up to the air once more. The paddle  was back at the task for which it had been carved, the canoe was  underway again, its occupant paying no more attention to what lay behind  than if he _had_ successfully disposed of the man in the water. To  follow would be only to invite another attack, and Shann might not be so  lucky next time. He was not good enough a swimmer to try any tricks such  as oversetting the canoe, not when Thorvald was an expert who could  easily finish off a fumbling opponent.    Shann swam wearily to shore where the wolverines waited, unable yet to  make sense of that attack in the lagoon. What had happened to Thorvald?  What motive had led the other to leave Shann and the animals on this  island, the island Thorvald had called a starting point in his search  for the natives of Warlock? Or had every bit of that tall tale been  invented by the Survey officer for some obscure purpose of his own,  certainly no sane purpose? Against that logic Shann could only set the  carved disk, and he had only Thorvald's word that that had been  discovered here.    He dragged himself out of the water on his hands and knees and lay,  winded and gasping. Taggi came to lick his face, nuzzle him, making a  small, bewildered whimpering. While above, the leather-headed birds  called and swooped, fearful and angry for their disturbed nesting place.  The Terran retched, coughed up water, and then sat up to look around.    The spread of lagoon was bare. Thorvald must have rounded the south  point of land and be very close to the reef passage, perhaps through it  by now. Not stopping for his clothes, Shann started up the slope,  crawling part of the way on his hands and knees.    He reached the crest again and got to his feet. The sun made an  eye-dazzling glitter of the waves. But under the shade of his hands  Shann saw the canoe again, beyond the reef, heading on out along the  island chain, not back to shore as he had expected. Thorvald was still  on the hunt, but for what? A reality which existed, or a dream in his  own disturbed brain?    Shann sat down. He was very hungry, for that adventure in the lagoon had  sapped his strength. And he was a prisoner along with the wolverines, a  prisoner on an island which was half the size of the valley which held  the Survey camp. As far as he knew, his only supply of drinkable water  was that tank of evil-smelling rain which would be speedily evaporated  by a sun such as the one now beating down on him. And between him and  the shore was the sea, a sea which harbored such creatures as the  fork-tail he had watched die.    Thorvald was still steadily on course, not to the next island in the  chain, a small, bare knob, but to the one beyond that. He could have  been hurrying to a meeting. Where and with what?    Shann got to his feet, started down to the beach once more, sure now  that the officer had no intention of returning, that he was again on his  own with only his wits and strength to keep him alive--alive and somehow  free of this water-washed prison.          10. A TRAP FOR A TRAPPER      Shann took up the piece of soft chalklike stone he had found and drew  another short white mark on the rust-red of a boulder well above tide  level. That made three such marks, three days since Thorvald had  marooned him. And he was no nearer the shore now than he had been on  that first morning! He sat where he was by the boulder, aware that he  should be up, trying to climb to the less accessible nests of the sea  birds. The prisoners, man and wolverines, had cleaned out all those they  had discovered on beach and cliffs. But at the thought of more eggs,  Shann's stomach knotted in pain and he began to retch.    There had been no sign of Thorvald since Shann had watched him steer  between the two westward islands. And the younger Terran's faint hope  that the officer would return had died. On the shore a few feet away lay  his own pitiful attempt to solve the problem of escape.    The force ax had vanished with Thorvald, along with all the rest of the  meager supplies which had been the officer's original contribution to  their joint equipment. Shann had used his knife on brush and small  trees, trying to put together some kind of a raft. But he had not been  able to discover here any of those vines necessary for binding, and his  best efforts had all come to grief when he tried them in a lagoon  launching. So far he had achieved no form of raft which would keep him  afloat longer than five minutes, let alone support three of them as far  as the next island.    Shann pulled listlessly at the framework of his latest try, fully  disheartened. He tried not to think of the unescapable fact that the  water in the rain tank had sunk to only an inch or so of muddy scum.  Last night he had dug in the heart of the interior valley where the  rankness of the vegetation was a promise of moisture, to uncover damp  clay and then a brackish ooze. Far too little to satisfy both him and  the animals.    There were surely fish somewhere in the lagoon. Shann wondered if the  raw flesh of sea dwellers could supply the water they needed. But  lacking net, line, or hooks, how did one fish? Yesterday, using his  stunner, he had brought down a bird, to discover the carcass so rank  even the wolverines, never dainty eaters, refused to gnaw it.    The animals prowled the two beaches, and Shann guessed they hunted shell  dwellers, for at times they dug energetically in the gravel. Togi was  busied in this way now, the sand flowing from under her pumping legs,  her claws raking in good earnest.    And it was Togi's excavation which brought Shann a first ray of hope.  Her excitement was so marked that he believed she was in quest of some  worthwhile game and he moved across to inspect the pit. A patch of  brown, which had been skimmed bare by one raking paw, made him shout.    Taggi shambled downslope, going to work beside his mate with an  eagerness as open as hers. Shann hovered at the edge of the pit they  were rapidly enlarging. The brown patch was larger, disclosing itself as  a hump doming up from the gravel. The Terran did not need to run his  hands over that rough surface to recognize the nature of the find. This  was another shell such as had come floating in after the storm to form  the raw material of their canoe.    However, as fast as the wolverines dug, they did not appear to make  correspondingly swift headway in uncovering their find as might  reasonably be expected. In fact, a witness could guess that the shell  was sinking at a pace only a fraction slower than the burrowers were  using to free it. Intrigued by that, Shann went back to the waterline,  secured one of the lengths he had been trying to weave into his  failures, and returned to use it as a makeshift shovel.    Now, with three of them at the digging, the brown hump was uncovered,  and Shann pried down around its edge, trying to lever it up and over. To  his amazement, his tool was caught and held, nearly jerked from his  hands. To his retaliating tug the obstruction below-ground gave way, and  the Terran sprawled back, the length of wood coming clear, to show the  other end smashed and splintered as if it had been caught between  mashing gears.    For the first time he understood that they were dealing not with an  empty shell casing buried by drift under this small beach, but with a  shell still inhabited by the Warlockian to whom it was a natural  covering, and that that inhabitant would fight to continue ownership. A  moment's examination of that splintered wood also suggested that the  shell's present wearer appeared well able to defend itself.    Shann attempted to call off the wolverines, but they were out of control  now, digging frantically to get at this new prey. And he knew that if he  pulled them away by force, they were apt to turn those punishing claws  and snapping jaws on him.    It was for their protection that he returned to digging, though he no  longer tried to pry up the shell. Taggi leaped to the top of that dome,  sweeping paws downward to clear its surface, while Togi prowled around  its circumference, pausing now and then to send dirt and gravel  spattering, but treading warily as might one alert for a sudden attack.    They had the creature almost clear now, though the shell still rested  firmly on the ground, and they had no notion of what it might protect.  It was smaller, perhaps two thirds the size of the one which Thorvald  had fashioned into a seagoing craft. But it could provide them with  transportation "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#18)"],[1,"as always he shivered with the horror of it, but for the first time it  came to him: _Briscoe had provoked his own death. He had physically  attacked the Lhari--threatened them, goaded them to shoot him down in  self-defense!_ \"I've been on shipboard with them for months. They're not  wanton murderers.\"    Raynor Two made a derisive sound. \"Sounds like it might be Three  talking!\"    Hedrick growled, \"Why waste time talking? Listen, young Steele, you'll  do as you're told, or else! Who gave you the right to argue?\"    \"Quiet, both of you.\" Montano came and laid his arm around Bart's  shoulders, persuasively. \"Bart, I know how you feel. But can't you trust  me? You're Rupert Steele's son, and you're here to carry on what your  father left undone, aren't you? If you fail now, there may not be  another chance for years--maybe not in our lifetimes.\"    Bart dropped his head in his hands. _Kill a whole shipload of  Lhari--innocent traders? Bald, funny old Rugel, stern Vorongil, Ringg--_    \"I don't know what to do!\" It was a cry of despair. Bart looked  helplessly around at the men.    Montano said, almost tenderly, \"You couldn't side with the Lhari against  men, could you? Could a son of Rupert Steele do that?\"    Bart shut his eyes, and something seemed to snap within him. His father  had died for this. He might not understand Montano's reasons, but he had  to believe that Montano had them.    \"All right,\" he said, thickly, \"you can count on me.\"    When he left Montano's house, he had the details of the plan, had  memorized the location of the device he was to sabotage, and accepted,  from Montano, a pair of dark contact lenses. \"The light's hellish out  there,\" Montano warned. \"I know you're half Mentorian, but they don't  even take their Mentorians out there. They're proud of saying no human  foot has ever touched Lharillis.\"    When he got back to the Lhari spaceport, Ringg hailed him. \"Where have  you been? I hunted the whole port for you! I wouldn't join the party  till you came. What's a pal for?\"    Bart brushed by him without speaking, disregarding Ringg's surprised  stare, and went up the ramp. He reached his own cabin and threw himself  down in his bunk, torn in two.    Ringg was his friend! Ringg liked him! And if he did what Montano  wanted, Ringg would die.    Ringg had followed him, and was standing in the cabin door, watching him  in surprise. \"Bartol, is something the matter? Is there anything I can  do? Have you had more bad news?\"    Bart's torn nerves snapped. He raised his head and yelled at Ringg,  \"Yes, there is something! You can quit following me around and just let  me alone for a change!\"    Ringg took a step backward. Then he said, very softly, \"Suit yourself,  Bartol. Sorry.\" And noiselessly, his white crest held high, he glided  away.    Bart's resolve hardened. Loneliness had done odd things to him--thinking  of Ringg, a Lhari, one of the freaks who had killed his father, as a  friend! If they knew who he was, they would turn on him, hunt him down  as they'd hunted Briscoe, as they'd hunted his father, as they'd hounded  him from Earth to Procyon. He put his scruples aside. He'd made up his  mind.    They could all die. What did he care? He was human and he was going to  be loyal to his own kind.          CHAPTER ELEVEN      But although he thought he had settled all the conflict, he found that  it returned when he was lying in his bunk, or when he stood in the dome  and watched the stars, while they moved through the Antares system  toward the captive sun and the tiny planet Lharillis.    _It's in my power to give this to all men...._    Should a few Lhari stand in his way?    He lay in his bunk brooding, thinking of death, staring at the yellow  radiation badge. _If you fail, it won't be in our lifetime._ He'd have  to go back to little things, to the little ships that hauled piddling  cargo between little planets, while all the grandeur of the stars  belonged to the Lhari. And if he succeeded, Vega Interplanet could  spread from star to star, a mighty memorial to Rupert Steele.    One day Vorongil sent for him. \"Bartol,\" he said, and his voice was not  unkind, \"you and Ringg have always been good friends, so don't be angry  about this. He's worried about you--says you spend all your spare time  in your bunk growling at him. Is there anything the matter, feathertop?\"    He sounded so concerned, so--the word struck Bart with hysterical  humor--so _fatherly_, that Bart wanted insanely to laugh and to cry.  Instead he muttered, \"Ringg should mind his own business.\"    \"But it's not like that,\" Vorongil said. \"Look, the _Swiftwing_'s a  world, young fellow, and a small one. If one being in that world is  unhappy, it affects everyone.\"    Bart had an absurd, painful impulse--to blurt out the incredible truth  to Vorongil, and try to get the old Lhari to understand what he was  doing.    But fear held him silent. He was alone, one small human in a ship of  Lhari. Vorongil was frowning at him, and Bart mumbled, \"It's nothing,  _rieko mori_.\"    \"I suppose you're pining for home,\" Vorongil said kindly. \"Well, it  won't be long now.\"    The glare of the captive sun grew and grew in the ports, and Bart's  dread mounted. He had, as yet, had no opportunity to put the radiation  counter out of order. It was behind a panel in the drive room, and try  as he might, he could think of no way to get to it unobserved.  Sometimes, in sleepless nights, it seemed that would be the best way.  Just let it go. But then the Lhari would detect Montano's ship, and kill  Montano and his men.    Did he believe that? He had to believe it. It was the only way he could  possibly justify what he was doing.    And then his chance came, as so many chances do when one no longer wants  them. The Second Officer met him at the beginning of one watch, saying  worriedly, \"Bartol, old Rugel's sick--not fit to be on his feet. Do you  think you can hold down this shift alone, if I drop in and give you a  hand from time to time?\"    \"I think so,\" Bart said, carefully not overemphasizing it. The Second  Officer, by routine, spent half of his time in the drive room, and half  his time down below in Maintenance. When he left, Bart knew he would  have at least half an hour, uninterrupted, in the drive room. He ripped  open the panel, located the wires and hesitated; he didn't quite dare to  cut them outright.    He jerked one wire loose, frayed the other with a sharp claw until it  was almost in shreds and would break with the first surge of current,  pulled two more connections loose so that they were not making full  contact. He closed the panel and brushed dust over it, and when the  Second Officer came back, Bart was at his own station.    As Antares fell toward them in the viewport, he found himself worrying  about Mentorians. They would be in cold sleep, presumably in a safe part  of the ship, behind shielding, or Montano would have made provisions for  them. Still, he wished there were a way to warn Meta.    He was not on watch when they came into the planetary field of  Lharillis, but when he came on shift, he knew at once that the trouble  had been located. The panel was pulled open, the exposed wires hanging,  and Ringg was facing old Rugel, shouting, \"Listen, Baldy, I won't have  you accusing me of going light on my work! I checked those panels eight  days ago! Tell me who's going to be opening the panels in here anyhow?\"    \"No, no,\" Rugel said patiently, \"I'm not accusing you of anything, only  being careless, young Ringg. You poke with those buzzing instruments and  things, maybe once you tear loose some wires.\"    Bart remembered he wasn't supposed to know what was going on. \"What's  this all about?\"    It was Rugel who answered. \"The radiation counter--the planetary one,  not the one we use in space--is out of order. We don't even need it this  landing--there's no radiation on Lharillis. If it were the landing gear,  now, that would be serious. I'm just trying to tell Ringg--\"    \"He's trying to say I didn't check it.\" Ringg was not to be calmed.  \"It's my professional competence--\"    \"Forget it,\" Bart said. \"If Rugel isn't sore about it, and if we don't  need it for landing, why worry?\" He felt like Judas.    \"Just take a look at my daybook,\" Ringg insisted, \"I checked and marked  it _service fit_! I tell you, somebody was blundering around, opening  panels where they had no business, tore it out by accident, then was too  much of a filthy sneak to report it and get it fixed!\"    \"Bartol was on watch alone one night,\" said the Second Officer, \"but you  wouldn't meddle with panels, would you, Bartol?\"    Bart set his teeth, steadying his breathing, as Ringg turned hopefully  to him. \"Bartol, did you--by mistake, maybe? Because if you did, it  won't count against your rating, but it means a black mark against  mine!\"    Bart hid his self-contempt in sudden, tense fury. \"No, I didn't! You're  going to accuse everybody on the _Swiftwing_, all the way from me to  Vorongil, before _you_ can admit a mistake, aren't you? If you want  somebody to blame, look in a mirror!\"    \"Listen, you!\" Ringg's pent-up rage exploded. He seized Bart by the  shoulder and Bart moved to throw him off, so that Ringg's outthrust  claws raked only his forearm. In pure reflex he felt his own claws flick  out; they clinched, closed, scuffled, and he felt his claws rake flesh;  half incredulous, saw the thin red line of blood welling from Ringg's  cheek.    Then Rugel's arms were flung restrainingly around him, and the Second  Officer was wrestling with a furious, struggling Ringg. Bart looked at  his red-tipped claws in ill-concealed horror, but it was lost in a  general gasp of consternation, for Vorongil had flung the drive room  door open, taking in the scene in one blistering glance.    _\"What's going on down here?\"_    For the first time, Bart understood Vorongil's reputation as a tyrant.  One glance at Ringg's bleeding face and Bart'"]]]
