The Browns and their friends seem to have been  silent spectators of these proceedings--doubtless with feelings of  astonishment if not of grief--but determined to worship in their  families and on the Sabbath in their old way. But in this they were  interrupted, and haled before the new Governor, Endicot, to answer for  their not coming to his worship and abandoning that which they and their  fathers, and Endicot himself, had practised; were called \"Separatists,\"  for not acting as such in regard to their old way of worship; and were  treated as \"seditious and mutinous,\" for justifying their fidelity to  the old worship before the new \"Star Chamber\" tribunal of Endicot. The  early New England ecclesiastical historian above quoted says: \"The  magistrates, or rather Endicot, _sent to demand a reason_[39] for their  separation. They _answered_ that as they were of the Church established  by law in their native country, it was highly proper they should worship  God as the Government required from whom they had received their  Charter. Surely they might be allowed that liberty of conscience which  all conceived to be reasonable when they were on the other side of the  water.\" But their arguments were called \"seditious and mutinous.\" The  first Congregational historian of Salem, above quoted, says: \"Endicot  had been the cause of all the rash proceedings against the Browns. He  was determined to execute his plan of Church government. Inexperienced  in the passions of men, and unaccustomed to consult even his friends, he  was resolved to admit of no opposition. They who could not be terrified  into silence _were not commanded to withdraw_, but were _seized_ and  _transported as criminals_.\"[40]    Such are the facts of the case itself, as related by the New England  Puritan writers themselves. I will now for a short time cross the  Atlantic, and see what were the professions and proceedings of the  Council or \"Grand Court\" of the Company in England in regard to the  chief objects of establishing the Plantation, their provision for its  religious wants, and their judgment afterwards of Endicot's proceedings.  In the Company's first letter of instructions to Endicot and his  Council, dated the 17th of April, 1629, they remind him that the  propagation of the Gospel was the primary object contemplated by them;  that they had appointed and contracted with three ministers to promote  that work, and instructed him to provide accommodation and necessaries  for them, according to agreement. They apprise him also of his  confirmation as \"Governor of _our_ Plantation,\" and of the names of the  Councillors joined with him.[41] In their letter to Endicot, they call  the ministers sent by them \"your ministers,\" and say: \"For the manner of  exercising their ministry, and teaching both our own people and the  Indians, we leave that to themselves, hoping they will make God's Word  the rule of their actions, and mutually agree in the discharge of their  duties.\" Such instructions and directions have doubtless been given by  the Managing Boards of many Missionary Societies to missionaries whom  they sent abroad; but without the least suspicion that such missionaries  could, in good faith, on arriving at their destination, ignore the  Church and ordination in connection with which they had been employed,  and set up a new Church, and even be parties to banishing from their new  field of labour to which they had been sent, the members of the Church  of which they themselves were professed ministers when they received  their appointment and stipulated support.    Six weeks after transmitting to Endicot the letter above referred to,  the Company addressed to him a second general letter of instructions.  This letter is dated the 28th of May, 1629, and encloses the official  proceedings of the Council or \"General Court\" appointing Endicot as  Governor, with the names of the Councillors joined with him, together  with the form of _oaths_ he and the other local officers of the Company  were to take.[42] The oath required to be taken by Endicot and each  local Governor is very full and explicit.[43] It is also to be observed  that these two letters of instructions, with forms of oaths and  appointments of his Council, were sent out three months before Endicot,  Higginson, and Skelton proceeded to ignore and abolish the Church  professed by the Company and themselves, and set up a new Church.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 22: Two years after the Plymouth settlement, \"Thirty-five  ships sailed this year (1622) from the west of England, and two from  London, to fish on the New England coasts, and made profitable voyages.\"  (Holmes' Annals of America, Vol. I., p. 179.) In a note on the same page  it is said: \"Where in Newfoundland they shared six or seven pounds for a  common man, in New England they shared fourteen pounds; besides, six  Dutch and French ships made wonderful returns in furs.\"]    [Footnote 23: \"The Council of New England, on the 19th of March (1627),  sold to Sir Henry Rowsell, Sir John Young, and four other associates,  [Thomas Southwood, John Humphrey, John Endicot, and Simeon Whitcombe,]  in the vicinity of Dorchester, in England, a patent for all that part of  New England lying between three miles to the northward of Merrimack  River, and three miles to the southward of Charles River, and in length  within the described breadth from the Atlantic Ocean to the South Sea.\"  (Holmes' Annals, Vol. I., p. 193.)]    [Footnote 24: The zeal of White soon found other powerful associates in  and out of London--kindred spirits, men of religious fervour, uniting  emotions of enthusiasm with unbending perseverance in action--Winthrop,  Dudley, Johnson, Pynchon, Eaton, Saltonstall, Bellingham, so famous in  colonial annals, besides many others, men of fortune and friends to  colonial enterprise. Three of the original purchasers parted with their  rights; Humphrey and Endicot retained an equal interest with the  original purchasers. (Bancroft's United States, Vol. I., pp. 368, 369.)]    [Footnote 25: Bancroft says: \"Endicot, a man of dauntless courage, and  that cheerfulness which accompanies courage, benevolent though austere,  firm though choleric, of a rugged nature, which the sternest forms of  Puritanism had not served to mellow, was selected as a fit instrument  for this wilderness work.' (History of the United States, Vol. I., pp.  369, 370.)    \"When the news reached London of the safe arrival of the emigrants  (under Endicot), the number of the adventurers had already enlarged. The  Puritans throughout England began to take an interest in the efforts  which invited the imagination to indulge in delightful visions. Interest  was also made to obtain a Royal Charter, with the aid of Bellingham and  White, an eminent lawyer, who advocated the design. The Earl of Warwick  had always been a friend to the Company; and Lord Dorchester, then one  of the Secretaries of State, is said to have exerted a powerful  influence in behalf of it. At last [March 4th, 1629], after much labour  and large expenditures, the patent for the Company of Massachusetts Bay  passed the seals.\" (_Ib._, p. 379.)]    [Footnote 26: The precursor of this Company was a Joint Stock  Association, established at Dorchester under the auspices of the Rev.  Mr. White, \"patriarch of Dorchester,\" and called the \"Dorchester  Adventurers,\" with a view to fishing, farming, and hunting; but the  undertaking was not successful, and an attempt was made to retrieve  affairs by putting the colony under a different direction. The  Dorchester partners heard of some religious and well-affected persons  that were lately removed out of New Plymouth, out of dislike of their  principles of rigid separation, of which Mr. Roger Conant was one--a  religious, sober, and prudent gentleman. (Hubbard's History of New  England, Chap. xviii.) The partners engaged Conant to be their Governor,  with the charge of all their affairs, as well fishing as planting. The  change did not produce success. The Association sold its land, shipping,  &c.; and Mr. Endicot was appointed under the new _regime_. (Palfrey's  Hist. of New England, Vol. I., pp. 285-8.)]    [Footnote 27: Palfrey, Vol. I., p. 289.]    [Footnote 28: _Ib._, p. 292.]    [Footnote 29: Mr. Bright, one of these ministers, is said by Hubbard to  have been a Conformist. He went, soon after his arrival, to Charlestown,  and tarried about a year in the country, when he returned to England.  Ralph Smith was required to give a pledge, under his hand, that he would  not exercise his ministry within the limits of the patent, without the  express leave of the Governor on the spot. Mr. Smith seems to have been  of the separation in England, which occasioned the caution to be used  with him. He was a little while in Nantasket, and went from thence to  Plymouth, where he was their minister for several years.

I'll  go and ask Charudatta. [_Aloud._] Just wait a moment. [_Approaching  Charudatta._] My friend, I just wanted to ask you in what  season the mango-trees blossom.    [81.3.

When on love's stage appears the passing show,        A host of wanderers shall bend them low.      Glad to be slaves in such captivity.                         12    [82.94. S.    See, Vasantasena, see!        The clouds hang drooping to the mountain peaks,      Like a maiden's heart, that distant lover seeks:      The peacocks startle, when the thunder booms,      And fan the heaven with all their jeweled plumes.            13    And again:        Mud-stained, and pelted by the streaming rain,      To drink the falling drops the frogs are fain;      Full-throated peacocks love's shrill passion show,      And nipa flowers like brilliant candles glow;      Unfaithful clouds obscure the hostage moon,      Like knaves, unworthy of so dear a boon;      Like some poor maid of better breeding bare,      The impatient lightning rests not anywhere.                  14    _Vasantasena._[65] Sir, what you say is most true. For        The night, an angry rival, bars my way;        Her thunders fain would check and hinder me:      \"Fond fool! with him I love thou shalt not stay,        'T is I, 't is I, he loves,\" she seems to say,        \"Nor from my swelling bosom shall he flee.\"                15    _Courtier._ Yes, yes. That is right. Scold the night.    _Vasantasena._ And yet, sir, why scold one who is so ignorant of  woman's nature! For you must remember:        The clouds may rain, may thunder ne'er so bold,        May flash the lightning from the sky above;      That woman little recks of heat or cold,        Who journeys to her love.                                  16    _Courtier._ But see, Vasantasena! Another cloud,        Sped by the fickle fury of the air--        A flood of arrows in his rushing streams,      His drum, the roaring thunder's mighty blare,        His banner, living lightning's awful gleams--        Rages within the sky, and shows him bold        'Mid beams that to the moon allegiance owe,      Like a hero-king within the hostile hold        Of his unwarlike foe.                                      17    P. 142.9]    _Vasantasena._ True, true. And more than this:        As dark as elephants, these clouds alone        Fall like a cruel dart--      With streaks of lightning and with white birds strewn--        To wound my wretched heart.      But, oh, why should the heron, bird of doom,        With that perfidious sound[66]      Of \"Rain! Rain! Rain!\"--grim summons to the tomb      For her who spends her lonely hours in gloom--        Strew salt upon the wound?                                 18    _Courtier._ Very true, Vasantasena. And yet again:        It seems as if the sky would take the guise        Of some fierce elephant to service bred;      The lightning like a waving streamer flies,        And white cranes serve to deck his mighty head.            19    _Vasantasena._ But look, sir, look!        Clouds, black as wet tamala-leaves, the ball        Of heaven hide from our sight;      Rain-smitten homes of ants decay and fall        Like beasts that arrows smite;      Like golden lamps within a lordly hall        Wander the lightnings bright;      As when men steal the wife of some base thrall,        Clouds rob the moon of light.                              20    _Courtier._ See, Vasantasena, see!        Clouds, harnessed in the lightning's gleams,        Like charging elephants dash by;      At Indra's bidding, pour their streams,      Until with silver cords it seems        That earth is linked with sky.                             21    [84.14. S.    And look yonder!        As herds of buffaloes the clouds are black;        The winds deny them ease;      They fly on lightning wings and little lack        Of seeming troubled seas.        Smitten with falling drops, the fragrant sod,      Upon whose bosom greenest grasses nod,      Seems pierced with pearls, each pearl an arrowy rod.         22    _Vasantasena._ And here is yet another cloud.        The peacock's shrill-voiced cry      Implores it to draw nigh;      And ardent cranes on high      Embrace it lovingly.        The wistful swans espy      The lotus-sweeter sky;      The darkest colors lie      On heaven clingingly.                                        23    _Courtier._ True. For see!        A thousand lotuses that bloom by night,      A thousand blooming when the day is bright,      Nor close nor ope their eyes to heaven's sight;        There is no night nor day.        The face of heaven, thus shrouded in the night,      Is only for a single instant bright,      When momentary lightning gives us sight;        Else is it dark alway.        Now sleeps the world as still as in the night      Within the house of rain where naught is bright,      Where hosts of swollen clouds seem to our sight        One covering veil of gray.                                 24    P. 143.20]    _Vasantasena._ True. And see!        The stars are lost like mercies given        To men of evil heart;      Like lonely-parted wives, the heaven        Sees all her charms depart.      And, molten in the cruel heat        Of Indra's bolt, it seems      As if the sky fell at our feet        In liquid, flowing streams.                                25    And yet again:        The clouds first darkly rise, then darkly fall,      Send forth their floods of rain, and thunder all;      Assuming postures strange and manifold,      Like men but newly blest with wealth untold.                 26    _Courtier._ True.        The heaven is radiant with the lightning's glare;        Its laughter is the cry of myriad cranes;      Its voice, the bolts that whistle through the air;        Its dance, that bow whose arrows are the rains.      It staggers at the winds, and seems to smoke      With clouds, which form its black and snaky cloak.           27    _Vasantasena._ O shameless, shameless sky!    "]]]
