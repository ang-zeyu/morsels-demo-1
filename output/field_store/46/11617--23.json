(#18)"],[1,"drawn up and submitted to the council  on this subject as theoretical, visionary, and unworthy of practical  statesmen. The meeting broke up without coming to any conclusion, and  before another could be convened, Northington demanded an audience of  the king; resigned under the pretence that the present ministry was  unable to carry on the government; and recommended that his majesty  should call Pitt into his councils. In consequence of this,  Pitt received the personal commands of his majesty to form a new  administration, offering him a _carte blanche_ for its formation.    Hitherto Pitt had manifested great patriotism, having served his  country, apparently, for the love of it alone. That he was ambitious,  however, he now proved. In reply to his majesty's commands he spoke of  his infirmities, and--although he was only fifty-eight years old--of his  great age. Under these circumstances he proposed taking to himself not  the premiership, with the direction of the house of commons, but the  office of privy-seal, which implied his exaltation to the peerage. The  king and the country alike stared with astonishment at this proposition,  but his views were not thwarted, and he proceeded to form his own  cabinet. Negociations failed with Lord Temple, the Marquess of  Rockingham, Lord Gower, Mr. Dowdeswell, and Lord Scarborough. In  the midst of them, however, Pitt received an autograph note from  his majesty, announcing his creation as Earl of Chatham, and thus  stimulated, he proceeded in his task. On the 2nd of August the members  of the new cabinet were formally announced in the Gazette. Pitt, as  Earl of Chatham, took the office of privy-seal; Lord Camden was made  chancellor; the Earl of Shelburne was appointed one of the secretaries  of state; General Conway continued in office as the other; the Duke of  Grafton was made first lord of the treasury; Charles Townshend became  chancellor of the exchequer; Sir Charles Saunders succeeded to the  admiralty; and the Earl of Hillsborough was nominated first lord of  trade. Several changes were also made in the subordinate places of the  treasury and the admiralty boards, and the strange medley, which soon  became more mixed and various, has been thus described by Burke:--\"He  [Lord Chatham] made an administration so chequered and speckled; he  put together a piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically  dovetailed; a cabinet so variously inlaid; such a piece of diversified  mosaic; such a tesselated pavement without cement; here a bit of black  stone, and there a bit of white; patriots and courtiers; king's friends  and republicans; Whigs and Tories; treacherous friends and open enemies;  that it was indeed a very curious show, but utterly unsafe to touch,  and unsure to stand on. The colleagues whom he had assorted at the same  boards stared at each other, and were obliged to ask, Sir, your name?  Sir, you have the advantage of me. Mr. Such-a-one, I beg a thousand  pardons. I venture to say it did so happen, that persons had a single  office divided between them, who had never spoken to each other in their  lives, until they found themselves, they knew not how, pigging together,  heads and points, in the same truckle bed.\"          DECLINE OF LORD CHATHAM'S POPULARITY.    Lord Chesterfield characterised the exaltation of Pitt to an earldom as  \"a fall up stairs\"--a fall which hurt him so much, that he would never  be able to stand upright again. By his acceptance of a coronet, in  truth, he greatly diminished his popularity. Burke undermined his  influence in the city by two clever publications: in the first of these  he gave an account of the late short administration, and in the second  he gave a humorous and ironical reply to it, in which the disingenuous  conduct of their successors was ably exposed. The wit of Chesterfield  ably seconded the pen of Burke; and the Earl of Chatham soon found that  though he was dignified by the king, he had shorn himself of all his  honours in the sight of the people. The influence which the Earl of Bute  was supposed to have had over him tended still more to blight his fair  fame. He was taunted with being a willing agent of men whom he did not  esteem, and his acceptance of a peerage was a never-failing source of  invective. Moreover, in his negociations with his brother-in-law, Lord  Temple, he had quarrelled with that nobleman, and all its disparaging  circumstances were freely discussed to his lasting disadvantage.. A  shower of pamphlets appealed against him, and the city of London,  where his influence had recently reigned paramount, mortified him, by  declining repeated proposals of presenting him with an address on his  appointment. Men saw in him no longer the unblemished patriot, but  looked upon him as a cringing slave to royalty for place and power. In  their displeasure they may have judged too harshly, but it is certain,  as Lord Chesterfield observed, that he was no longer Mr. Pitt in any  respect, but _only_ the Earl of Chatham. The charms of his eloquence  were lost for ever, for when the people can place no confidence in their  rulers, the finest oratory is but an empty sound.    It happened unfortunately for the Earl of Chatham's popularity, that  owing to a deficiency in the harvest of last year great scarcity  prevailed, and as distress existed on the continent. The people, always  disposed to look upon the dark side of the picture, apprehended that  the country would be involved in all the horrors of famine. The price  of provisions greatly increased, and in consequence tumultuous riots  occurred in various parts of the kingdom, in which many lives were lost.  Some of the rioters were captured, and special commissions were sent  into the country to try them, and, in many instances, they were brought  to condign punishment. A proclamation was issued for enforcing the law  against forestallers and regraters, but as the price of all articles  rose, and the city of London made a representation to the throne  respecting large orders for wheat which had been received from the  continent, another was issued prohibiting its exportation. At the same  time an embargo was laid by royal authority on all outward-bound vessels  laden with corn.    It was not in England alone that the waning influence of the Earl of  Chatham became manifest. One of his first diplomatic attempts was to  establish a powerful northern confederacy, principally between England,  Prussia, and Russia, in order to counterbalance the formidable alliance  framed by the Bourbons in their family compact. The king of Prussia,  however, was averse to the formation of any new and stricter connexions  with England, as well on account of the usage he had met with during the  late war, as of the unsettled state of the government of Great Britain  since the peace. \"Till he saw,\" he said, \"more stability in our  administration, he did not choose to draw his connexions with us  closer,\" and the negociations was therefore dropped.          MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.    The session was opened on the 11th of November, and the principal  topic of the king's speech was the scarcity of corn; and measures were  recommended, if necessary, for allaying or remedying the evil. The  address was opposed in both houses, and in the commons four amendments  were moved, but the government in every instance had a majority. On the  subject of the embargo, however, and the delay of assembling parliament  when the country was in such critical circumstances, ministers had a  harder battle to fight. It was thought right to pass a bill of indemnity  in favour of those who had acted in obedience to the council with  respect to the embargo, and when this bill was brought in by a member  of the cabinet, a remark was made, that although it provided for the  security of the inferior officers, who had acted under the proclamation,  it passed over those who advised the measure. This gave rise to much  altercation and debate, especially among the lords, where the Earl of  Chatham, Lord Camden, and others, who had long been the advocates of  popular rights, vindicated the present exercise of royal prerogative,  not on the plea of necessity but of right: arguing that a dispensing  power was inherent in the crown, which might be exerted during the  recess of parliament, but which expired whenever parliament reassembled.  Camden asserted that Junius Brutus would not have hesitated to entrust  such a power even to a Nero, and that it was at most but \"a forty  day's tyranny.\" The Earl of Chatham was a more powerful advocate of the  measure. He vindicated the issuing of the embargo by legal authority  during the recess of parliament as an act of power justifiable on the  ground of necessity, and he read a paragraph from Locke on Government,  to show that his views were borne out by that great friend of liberty,  that constitutional philosopher, and that liberal statesman. The  sentiments of the ministers, however, were strongly opposed by Lords  Temple, Lyttleton, and Mansfield, the latter of whom, though he had once  been spell-bound by court influence, \"rode the great horse Liberty with  much applause.\" The Earl of Chatham replied, but the constitutional  principles which his opposers laid down could not be answered with  success, for although parliament passed the act of indemnity, yet the  opposition lords so enlightened the public mind upon the subject, that  the cry was instantly raised that the present ministers had sold their  consciences to the court, and were in a league to extend the prerogative  beyond the precedent of the worst periods in English history. The  ferment was greatly increased by Mr. Beckford's declaring in the house  of commons, that the crown had in all cases of necessity a power to  dispense with laws: an assertion which retraction, explanation, and  contradiction from the same lips, could not efface from the public mind.

The        Dictionary of American Biography states that Draper's father was a        Roman Catholic who assumed the name John Christopher Draper when        disowned by his family for becoming a Methodist, and that his real        name is unknown.

Henschel in \"Centenary of John William Draper\" (New        York University \"Colonnade,\" June, 1911) has the following: \"If        there be among us any who trace their lineage to the sunny fields of        Italy, they may feel a just pride in John William Draper, for his        father, John C. Draper, was an Italian by birth...\"          The translator's thanks are also due to Madame Laura Dreyfus-Barney        for investigations in connection with this passage at the Library of        Congress and the Bibliotheque Nationale.       59 Qur'an 3:110.       60 Qur'an 3:100.       61 Qur'an 16:92.       62 Qur'an 7:198.       63 Qur'an 3:128.       64 Qur'an 2:172.       65 Qur'an 59:9.       66 Qur'an 2:203.       67 Qur'an 42:36.       68 Qur'an 3:153.       69 Qur'an 17:14.       70 Qur'an 59:9.       71 Qur'an 23:14: \"Blessed therefore be God, the most excellent of        Makers.\"       72 Qur'an 17:31; 110.       73 Rumi, The Ma_th_navi, II 2:277.
