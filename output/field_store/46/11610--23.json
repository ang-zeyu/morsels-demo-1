The missionary in charge, Mr. Frank Dymond, is one  of the most agreeable men I met in China, broad-minded, sympathetic and  earnest--universally honoured and respected by all the district. Since  the mission was opened three converts have been baptised, one of whom is  in Szechuen, another is in Tongchuan, and the third has been gathered to  his fathers. The harvest has not been abundant, but there are now six  promising inquirers, and the missionary is not discouraged. The mission  premises are built on land which cost two hundred and ninety taels, and  are well situated not far from the south gate, the chief yamens, the  temples, and the French Mission. People are friendly, but manifest  dangerously little interest in their salvation.    At Chaotong I had entered upon a district that had been devastated by  recurring seasons of plague and famine. Last year more than 5000 people  are believed to have died from starvation in the town and its immediate  neighbourhood. The numbers are appalling, but doubt must always be  thrown upon statistics derived from Chinese sources. The Chinese and  Japanese disregard of accuracy is characteristic of all Orientals.  Beggars were so numerous, and became such a menace to the community,  that their suppression was called for; they were driven from the  streets, and confined within the walls of the temple and grounds beyond  the south gate, and fed by common charity. Huddled together in rags and  misery, they took famine fever and perished by hundreds. Seventy dead  were carried from the temple in one day. Of 5000 poor wretches who  crossed the temple threshold, the Chinese say that 2000 never came out  alive. For four years past the harvests had been very bad, but there was  now hope of a better time coming. Opportune rains had fallen, and the  opium crop was good. More than anything else the district depends for  its prosperity upon the opium crop--if the crop is good, money is  plentiful. Maize-cobs last harvest were four times the size of those of  the previous harvest, when they were no larger than one's finger. Wheat  and beans were forward; the coming rice crop gave every hope of being a  good one. Food was still dear, and all prices were high, because rice  was scarce and dear, and it is the price of rice which regulates the  market. In a good year one sheng of rice (6-2/3lbs.) costs thirty-five  cash (less than one penny), it now costs 110 cash. The normal price of  maize is sixteen cash the sheng, it now cost sixty-five cash the sheng.  To make things worse, the weight of the sheng had been reduced with the  times from twelve catties to five catties, and at the same time the  relation of cash to silver had fallen from 1640 to 1250 cash the tael.    The selling of its female children into slavery is the chief sorrow of  this famine-stricken district. During last year it is estimated, or  rather, it is stated by the Chinese, that no less than three thousand  children from this neighbourhood, chiefly female children and a few  boys, were sold to dealers and carried like poultry in baskets to the  capital. At ordinary times the price for girls is one tael (three  shillings) for every year of their age, thus a girl of five costs  fifteen shillings, of ten, thirty shillings, but in time of famine  children, to speak brutally, become a drug in the market. Female  children were now offering at from three shillings and fourpence to six  shillings each. You could buy as many as you cared to, you might even  obtain them for nothing if you would enter into an agreement with the  father, which he had no means of enforcing, to take care of his child,  and clothe and feed her, and rear her kindly. Starving mothers would  come to the mission beseeching the foreign teachers to take their babies  and save them from the fate that was otherwise inevitable.    Girls are bought in Chaotong up to the age of twenty, and there is  always a ready market for those above the age of puberty; prices then  vary according to the measure of the girl's beauty, an important feature  being the smallness of her feet. They are sold in the capital for wives  and _yatows_; they are rarely sold into prostitution. Two important  factors in the demand for them are the large preponderance in the number  of males at the capital, and the prevalence there of goitre or thick  neck, a deformity which is absent from the district of Chaotong.  Infanticide in a starving city like this is dreadfully common. \"For the  parents, seeing their children must be doomed to poverty, think it  better at once to let the soul escape in search of a more happy asylum  than to linger in one condemned to want and wretchedness.\" The  infanticide is, however, exclusively confined to the destruction of  female children, the sons being permitted to live in order to continue  the ancestral sacrifices.    One mother I met, who was employed by the mission, told the missionary  in ordinary conversation that she had suffocated in turn three of her  female children within a few days of birth; and, when a fourth was born,  so enraged was her husband to discover that it was also a girl that he  seized it by the legs and struck it against the wall and killed it.    Dead children, and often living infants, are thrown out on the common  among the gravemounds, and may be seen there any morning being gnawed by  dogs. Mr. Tremberth of the Bible Christian Mission, leaving by the south  gate early one morning, disturbed a dog eating a still living child  that had been thrown over the wall during the night. Its little arm was  crunched and stript of flesh, and it was whining inarticulately--it died  almost immediately. A man came to see me, who for a long time used to  heap up merit for himself in heaven by acting as a city scavenger. Early  every morning he went round the city picking up dead dogs and dead cats  in order to bury them decently--who could tell, perhaps the soul of his  grandfather had found habitation in that cat? While he was doing this  pious work, never a morning passed that he did not find a dead child,  and usually three or four. The dead of the poor people are roughly  buried near the surface and eaten by dogs.    An instance of the undoubted truth of the doctrine of transmigration  occurred recently in Chaotong and is worth recording. A cow was killed  near the south gate on whose intestine--and this fact can be attested by  all who saw it--was written plainly and unmistakably the character  \"_Wong_,\" which proved, they told me, that the soul of one whose name  was Wong had returned to earth in the body of that cow.    I stayed two days in Chaotong, and strolled in pleasant company through  the city. Close to the Mission is the yamen of the Chentai or  Brigadier-General, the Military Governor of this portion of the  province, and a little further is the more crowded yamen of the Fu  Magistrate. Here, as in all yamens, the detached wall or fixed screen of  stone facing the entrance is painted with the gigantic representation of  a mythical monster in red trying to swallow the sun--the Chinese  illustration of the French saying \"_prendre la lune avec les dents_.\" It  is the warning against covetousness, the exhortation against squeezing,  and is as little likely to be attended to by the magistrate here as it  would be by his brother in Chicago. We visited the Confucian Temple  among the trees and the examination hall close by, and another yamen,  and the Temple of the God of Riches. In the yamen, at the time of our  visit, a young official, seated in his four-bearer chair, was waiting in  the outer court; he had sent in his visiting card, and attended the  pleasure of his superior officer. China may be uncivilised and may yearn  for the missionaries, but there was refined etiquette in China, and an  interchange of many of the pleasantest courtesies of modern  civilisation, when we noble Britons were grubbing in the forest, painted  savages with a clout.    As we went out of the west gate, I was shown the spot where a few days  before a young woman, taken in adultery, was done to death in a cage  amid a crowd of spectators, who witnessed her agony for three days. She  had to stand on tiptoe in the cage, her head projecting through a hole  in the roof, and here she had to remain until death by exhaustion or  strangulation ensued, or till some kind friend, seeking to accumulate  merit in heaven, passed into her mouth sufficient opium to poison her,  and so end her struggles.    On the gate itself a man not so long ago was nailed with red-hot nails  hammered through his wrists above the hands. In this way he was exposed  in turn at each of the four gates of the city, so that every man, woman,  and child could see his torture. He survived four days, having  unsuccessfully attempted to shorten his pain by beating his head against  the woodwork, an attempt which was frustrated by padding the woodwork.  This man had murdered and robbed two travellers on the high road, and,  as things are in China, his punishment was not too severe.    No people are more cruel in their punishments than the Chinese, and  obviously the reason is that the sensory nervous system of a Chinaman is  either blunted or of arrested development. Can anyone doubt this who  witnesses the stoicism with which a Chinaman can endure physical pain  when sustaining surgical operation without chloroform, the comfort with  which he can thrive amid foul and penetrating smells, the calmness with  which he can sleep amid the noise of gunfire and crackers, drums and  tomtoms, and the indifference with which he contemplates the sufferings  of lower animals, and the infliction of tortures on higher?    Every text-book on China devotes a special chapter to the subject of  punishment. Mutilation is extremely common. Often I met men who had been  deprived of their ears--they had lost them, they explained, in battle  facing the enemy!

Consequently, unless the  melter exercises good judgment in charging, the Scotch pig will  melt and run off before the car-wheel iron is melted. If G. H. P.  be particular in the quality and strength of his iron, he will make  better results by using soft American charcoal pig, with old car-wheel  iron. It will make stronger castings, mix better, and melt more  uniformly; but he should always recollect in charging his furnace that  soft iron will melt before hard in the same position, in the cupola. I  also think he had better use a larger proportion of soft pig, as every  time cast iron is melted it becomes harder, so much so that iron which  can be filed and turned with ease, when re-cast will often be found  too hard to work.--J. T., of N. Y.      HARDENING TALLOW.--If E. H. H. will use one pound of alum for every  five pounds of tallow, his candles will be as hard and white as wax.  The alum must be dissolved in water, then put in the tallow, and  stirred until they are both melted together, and run in molds.--F. O.  H.      L. L., of N. Y.--According to Ure, strass is made as follows: 8 ounces  of pure rock crystal or flint, in powder, mixed with 4 ounces of  salt of tartar, are to be baked and left to cool. The mixture is then  poured into hot water, and treated with dilute nitric acid till it  ceases to effervesce, and the \"frit\" is then washed in water till the  water comes off tasteless. The frit is then dried, and mixed with 12  ounces of white lead, and this last mixture reduced to fine powder,  and washed with distilled water; 1 ounce of calcined borax is now  added to every 12 ounces of the mixture, the whole rubbed together in  a porcelain mortar, melted in a clean crucible, and poured out into  pure cold water. This melting and pouring into water must be done  three times, using a clean, new crucible each time. The third frit is  pulverized, five drachms of niter added, and then melted for the last  time, when a clean, beautiful white crystal mass results.      C. M. S., of Wis.--There are no precise proportions observed in  making the coal-tar and gravel walks of which you speak. The aim is to  saturate the gravel with the hot tar without surplus. The interstices  of the gravel are simply to be filled, and the amount required to  do this depends wholly upon the coarseness or fineness of the gravel  employed.      W. P. T., of Ohio.--Two teams of horses, of equal strength, pulling  against each other, by means of a rope, would create the same tension  in the rope, as one of the teams drawing against an immovable object.      W. H. B., of Va.--Ice can be made by compressing air, and, after it  has radiated its heat, allowing it to extract the heat of water with  which it is brought into contact. The temperature of air at 59 deg. Fah.,  would be raised, by compressing the air to one fourth its original  volume, to 317 deg. Fah; and the air would radiate and absorb again, in  expanding, about 190 units of heat.      E. T. H., of Ga.--The friable sandstone, a specimen of which you send  us, may, we think, be rendered firmer by soaking it in a solution of  silicate of soda, and allowing it to stand till dry.      J. A. V., of Ohio.--The use of steam expansively, by means of cut-off  appliances, enables the expansive force of the steam to be utilized,  which cannot be done when the pressure is maintained at one standard,  and steam admitted through the fall stroke. It takes no more power  to do a given amount of work in one case than in the other, but more  boiler capacity, and more fuel, as the working power of the steam is  more economically applied when the cut-off is used.      Geo. F. R., of Ohio.--Type metal is composed of 3 parts lead and 1  part antimony for smallest, hardest, and most brittle types; 4 of  lead and 1 of antimony for next grade; 5 of lead and 1 of antimony for  medium sizes; 6 of lead and 1 of antimony for larger types; and 7 of  lead and 1 of antimony for the largest.      E. J. M., of Texas.--The term \"power of a boiler\" means its  evaporating power, and in that sense is proper. If its evaporative  power be sufficient to perform a given amount of work, it is proper  to estimate that work in horse power. Water can not be pumped out of a  pipe from which atmospheric air is excluded. A pipe driven into a soil  impervious to air, can never yield water unless the water is forced up  by hydraulic power, as in the artesian system.      A. P. Y., of N.

Y.--The lining up of a beam engine, in a vessel, is  a process for which no definite mode of procedure is exclusively  applicable. It is an operation to which common sense and judgment must  be brought, and for which each engineer must be a law unto himself.      J.
