No, sir,  no,' continued he, slowly and thoughtfully, dropping the silver to  half-minute time; 'no, sir, no; if I might make free with a gen'leman o'  your helegance,' continued he, after a pause,' I'd say, sell 'im to a  post-master or a buss-master, or some sich cattle as those, but I doesn't  think I'd put 'im into the 'ands of no gen'leman, that's to say if I were  _you_, at least,' added he.    'Well, then, will you speculate on him yourself for the buss-masters?'  asked Mr. Waffles, tired alike of the colloquy and the quadruped.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF LORD BULLFROG, FORMERLY OWNER OF 'HERCULES']    'Oh, vy, as to that,' replied Mr. Buckram, with an air of the most perfect  indifference, 'vy, as to that--not bein' nouther a post-master nor a  buss-master--but 'aving, as I said before, a little hindependence o' my  own, vy, I couldn't in course give such a bountiful price as if I could  turn 'im to account at once; but if it would be any 'commodation to you,'  added he, working the silver up into full cry, 'I wouldn't mind givin' you  the with (worth) of 'im--say, deductin' expenses hup to town, and standin'  at livery afore I finds a customer--expenses hup to town,' continued Mr.  Buckram, muttering to himself in apparent calculation, 'standin' at  livery--three-and-sixpence a night, grum, and so on--I wouldn't mind,'  continued he briskly, 'givin' of you twenty pund for 'im--if you'd throw me  back a sov.,' continued he, seeing Mr. Waffles' brow didn't contract into  the frown he expected at having such a sum offered for his  three-hundred-guinea horse.    In the course of an hour, that wonderful invention of modern times,--the  Electric Telegraph--conveyed the satisfactory words 'All right' to our  friend Mr. Sponge, just as he was sitting down to dinner in a certain  sumptuously sanded coffee-room in Conduit Street, who forthwith sealed and  posted the following ready-written letter:        'BANTAM HOTEL, BOND STREET.        'SIR,    'I have been greatly surprised and hurt to hear that you have thought fit  to impeach my integrity, and insinuate that I had taken you in with the  brown horse. Such insinuations touch one in a tender point--one's  self-respect. The bargain, I may remind you, was of your own seeking, and I  told you at the time I knew nothing of the horse, having only ridden him  once, and I also told you where I got him. To show how unjust and unworthy  your insinuations have been, I have now to inform you that, having  ascertained that Lord Bullfrog knew he was vicious, I insisted on his  lordship taking him back, and have only to add that, on my receiving him  from you, I will return you your bill.'        'I am, Sir, your obedient servant,        'H. SPONGE.        'To W. WAFFLES, Esq.,        'Imperial Hotel, Laverick Wells.'    Mr. Waffles was a good deal vexed and puzzled when he got this letter. He  had parted with the horse, who was gone no one knew where, and Mr. Waffles  felt that he had used a certain freedom of speech in speaking of the  transaction. Mr. Sponge having left Laverick Wells, had, perhaps, led him a  little astray with his tongue--slandering an absent man being generally  thought a pretty safe game; it now seemed Mr. Waffles was all wrong, and  might have had his money back if he had not been in such a hurry to part  with the horse. Like a good many people, he thought he had best eat up his  words, which he did in the following manner:        'IMPERIAL HOTEL, LAVERICK WELLS.        'DEAR MR. SPONGE,    'You are quite mistaken in supposing that I ever insinuated anything  against _you_ with regard to the horse. I said _he_ was a beast, and it  seems Lord Bullfrog admits it. However, never mind anything more about him,  though I am equally obliged to you for the trouble you have taken. The fact  is, I have parted with him.    'We are having capital sport; never go out but we kill, sometimes a brace,  sometimes a leash of foxes. Hoping you are recovered from the effects of  your ride through the window, and will soon rejoin us, believe me, dear Mr.  Sponge,'        'Yours very sincerely,        'W. WAFFLES.'    To which Mr. Sponge shortly after rejoined as follows:        'BANTAM HOTEL, BOND STREET.        'DEAR WAFFLES,    'Yours to hand--I am glad to receive a disclaimer of any unworthy  imputations respecting the brown horse. Such insinuations are only for  horse-dealers, not for men of high gentlemanly feeling.    'I am sorry to say we have not got out of the horse as I hoped. Lord  Bullfrog, who is a most cantankerous fellow, insists upon having him back,  according to the terms of my letter; I must therefore trouble you to hunt  him up, and let us accommodate his lordship with him again. If you will say  where he is, I may very likely know some one who can assist us in getting  him. You will excuse this trouble, I hope, considering that it was to serve  you that I moved in the matter, and insisted on returning him to his  lordship, at a loss of L50 to myself, having only given L250 for him.'        'I remain, dear Waffles,        'Yours sincerely,        'H. SPONGE.'        'To W. WAFFLES, Esq.,        'Imperial Hotel, Laverick Wells.'        'LAVERICK WELLS.        'DEAR SPONGE,    'I'm afraid Bullfrog will have to make himself happy without his horse, for  I hav'n't the slightest idea where he is. I sold him to a cockneyfied,  countryfied sort of a man, who said he had a small \"hindependence of his  own\"--somewhere, I believe, about London. He didn't give much for him, as  you may suppose, when I tell you he paid for him chiefly in silver. If I  were you, I wouldn't trouble myself about him.'        'Yours very truly,        'W. WAFFLES.        'To H. SPONGE, Esq.'    Our hero addressed Mr. Waffles again, in the course of a few days, as  follows:    'DEAR WAFFLES,    'I am sorry to say Bullfrog won't be put off without the horse. He says I  insisted on his taking him back, and now he insists on having him. I have  had his lawyer, Mr. Chousam, of the great firm of Chousam, Doem, and Co.,  of Throgmorton Street, at me, who says his lordship will play old  gooseberry with us if we don't return him by Saturday. Pray put on all  steam, and look him up.'        'Yours in haste,        'H. SPONGE.        'To W. WAFFLES, Esq.'    Mr. Waffles did put on all steam, and so successfully that he ran the  horse to ground at our friend Mr. Buckram's. Though the horse was in the  box adjoining the house, Mr. Buckram declared he had sold him to go to  'Hireland'; to what county he really couldn't say, nor to what hunt; all he  knew was, the gentleman said he was a 'captin,' and lived in a castle.    Mr. Waffles communicated the intelligence to Sponge, requesting him to do  the best he could for him, who reported what his 'best' was in the  following letter:      'DEAR WAFFLES,    'My lawyer has seen Chousam, and deuced stiff he says he was. It seems  Bullfrog is indignant at being accused of a \"do\"; and having got me in the  wrong box, by not being able to return the horse as claimed, he meant to  work me. At first Chousam would hear of nothing but \"l--a--w.\" Bullfrog's  wounded honour could only be salved that way. Gradually, however, we  diverged from l--a--w to L--s.--d.; and the upshot of it is, that he will  advise his lordship to take L250 and be done with it. It's a bore; but I  did it for the best, and shall be glad now to know your wishes on the  subject. Meanwhile, I remain,'        'Yours very truly,        'H. SPONGE.        'To W. WAFFLES, Esq.'    Formerly a remittance by post used to speak for itself. The tender-fingered  clerks could detect an enclosure, however skilfully folded. Few people  grudged double postage in those days. Now one letter is so much like  another, that nothing short of opening them makes one any wiser. Mr. Sponge  received Mr. Waffles' answer from the hands of the waiter with the sort of  feeling that it was only the continuation of their correspondence. Judge,  then, of his delight, when a nice, clean, crisp promissory note, on a  five-shilling stamp, fell quivering to the floor. A few lines, expressive  of Mr. Waffles' gratitude for the trouble our hero had taken, and hopes  that it would not be inconvenient to take a note at two months,  accompanied it. At first Mr. Sponge was overjoyed. It would set him up for  the season. He thought how he'd spend it. He had half a mind to go to  Melton. There were no heiresses there, or else he would. Leamington would  do, only it was rather expensive. Then he thought he might as well have  done Waffles a little more.    'Confound it!' exclaimed Sponge, 'I don't do myself justice! I'm too much  of a gentleman! I should have had five 'under'd--such an ass as Waffles  deserves to be done!'          CHAPTER XIII    A NEW SCHEME      [Illustration]    Our friend Soapey was now in good feather; he had got a large price for his  good-for-nothing horse, with a very handsome bonus for not getting him  back, making him better off than he had been for some time. Gentlemen of  his calibre are generally extremely affluent in everything except cash.  They have bills without end--bills that nobody will touch, and book debts  in abundance--book debts entered with metallic pencils in curious little  clasped pocket-books, with such utter disregard of method that it would  puzzle an accountant to comb them into anything like shape.    It is true, what Mr. Sponge got from Mr. Waffles were bills--but they were  good bills, and of such reasonable date as the most exacting of the Jew  tribe would 'do' for twenty per cent. Mr. Sponge determined to keep the  game alive, and getting Hercules and Multum in Parvo together again, he  added a showy piebald hack, that Buckram had just got from some circus  people who had not been able to train him to their work.    The question now was, where to manoeuvre this imposing stud--a problem  that Mr. Sponge "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#18)"],[1,"of this  reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was  set forth clearly in the title: \"An act for granting certain duties in  the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the  produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,  protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for  more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and  from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the  trade between the same and Great Britain.\" The old Molasses Act had been  prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue  measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,  and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement  of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had  \"teeth in it.\" Special precautions as to bonds, security, and  registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised  a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.    The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative  measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed  vessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,  search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial  ports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in  America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and  navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and  royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty  in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge  of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for  naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by  large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.    =The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved  steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration  in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next  year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded  its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;  while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality  of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received  royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of  colonial agents in London were futile. \"We might as well have hindered  the sun's progress!\" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in  the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and  from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid  interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful  measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to  act for the king when he was incapacitated.    The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British  government to raise revenue in America \"towards defraying the expenses  of defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and  plantations in America.\" It was a long measure of more than fifty  sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions  duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal  transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on  licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing  cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and  advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything  escaped.    =The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp  Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not  conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General  Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous  warning in the Commons. \"Believe me--remember I this day told you so--\"  he exclaimed, \"the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at  first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties  and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated.\" The  answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.  Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of  soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the  Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the  colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce  the new laws. \"We have the power to tax them,\" said one of the ministry,  \"and we will tax them.\"      COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL    =Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an  outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the  lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to  import British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,  some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others  intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped  papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had  long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested  against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old  England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many  of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and  Whig aristocrats as \"seditious, factious and republican.\" Yet the  opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering  Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.    In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the  countryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,  there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to  resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were  known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including  artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both  groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public  affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the  right to vote for colonial assemblymen.    While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to  drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of  Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred  up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts  were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of  high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by  threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use  of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations  to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were  frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had  unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very  effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on  domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture  of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to  feed and clothe their families without buying British goods.    =Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial  assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the  popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,  the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring  that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes  upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were  \"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust.\" It was in support of these  resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: \"Caesar  had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III....\" Cries of  \"Treason\" were calmly met by the orator who finished: \"George III may  profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it.\"    [Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]    =The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call  of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to  be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded  and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest  affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record  a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They  declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given  through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed  a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade  acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the  king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made \"humble  supplication\" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.    The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked  the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.  It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the  government of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress  of the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt  at union. \"There ought to be no New England men,\" declared Christopher  Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, \"no New Yorkers known on the  Continent, but all of us Americans.\"    =The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American  resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies  had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging  at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,  Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England  were thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was  reaping, in place of the coveted"]]]
