Like his mother, he is constantly in want. He is eager,  ravenous, and wandering about bare-footed, without home or habitation,  sleeping before doors or by the wayside, under the open sky. But at  the same time he is ever forming designs upon all that is beautiful,  is forward, cunning, and fond of new tricks.    Fate mysteriously clings round this earth, the heavens, and the  creatures in the regions above and below. When Jupiter heard of the  death of his son Sarpedon, in great grief he called on Mercury to go  instantly to the Fates, and bring from them the strong box in which  the eternal decrees are laid up. Mercury went to the Fatal Sisters,  and delivered his message. The Sisters smiled, and told him that the  other end of the golden chain which secured the box with the  unalterable decrees was so fixed to the throne of Jove, that were it  to be unfastened, the master's seat itself might be shaken.    Jupiter holds in his hands the unerring balance of fate. Close to his  throne stand the two inexhaustible urns--the one filled with good  fortune and happiness, the other with misfortune and misery. Out of  these is mixed a dose of life to every mortal man; and as the draught  is, so are one's days embittered with disasters, or made pleasant with  serenity, ease, and prosperity. To every star is allotted a mind, and  all things have their fixed irrevocable laws. The human nature is  twofold; and man, who lives well on earth, returns after death to the  habitations of his congenial star, and there leads a blessed life;  but, failing in his duties, he is doomed to live a thousand years in  a degraded state. Sometimes a human soul is destined to animate a  wild beast, never to be relieved until it reattain the purest of its  first and best existence.    The Goths and Vandals entertained the opinion that the first man and  woman were made of an ash-tree. Odin, it is said, gave them breath,  Hener endowed them with reason, and Lodur injected blood into their  veins, and provided them with beautiful faces.    Pan has been represented as the emblem of all things, and among the  learned of early times he passed for the first and oldest of the  divinities. His person is composed of various and opposite parts--a  man and a goat. According to the most ancient Egyptians and Greeks, he  had neither father nor mother, but sprang of Demogorgon at the same  instant with the Fatal Sisters, the Parcae.    The power of the heathen gods and goddesses is reported as truly  wonderful. Apollo turned Daphne, whom he loved, into a laurel, and his  boy Hyacinth into a violet. Mars was the son of Jupiter and Juno, or,  according to Ovid, of Juno alone, who conceived him at the smell of a  flower shown her by the goddess Flora.    Juno is esteemed the goddess of kingdoms and riches. She is  represented as a majestic beautiful woman, riding in a golden chariot  drawn by peacocks, waving a sceptre in her hand, and wearing a crown  set about with roses and lilies, and encircled with fair Iris, or the  rainbow. She is also supposed to preside over matrimony and births,  and is the guardian angel of woman.    Venus is the goddess of love and beauty; she sprang from the foam of  the sea. As soon as she was born she was cast upon the island of  Cyprus, where she was educated, and afterwards being carried to  heaven, was married to Vulcan. Her image is fair and beautiful; she is  clothed with purple, glittering with diamonds. There are two Cupids on  her side, while around her are the Graces. Her chariot is of ivory,  drawn by swans, doves, or swallows.    Whilst Latona was wandering through the fields of Lycia, she desired  to drink from a spring at the bottom of a valley, but the country  rustics drove her away. In spite of her entreaties, they refused to  allow her to slake her thirst, whereupon, in wrath, she, cursing them,  said, \"May ye always live in this water!\" Immediately they were turned  into frogs, and leaped into the streams and pools, where they  continued to exist.    Vulcan, notwithstanding his noble descent, is obliged to follow the  trade of a blacksmith. On account of his deformity, he was cast down  from heaven into the isle of Lemnos. His leg was broken by the fall.  He erected a forge, where he makes thunderbolts for his father Jupiter  and armour for the other gods. His servants are called Cyclops,  because they have but one eye. Though Vulcan is unpleasant in the  sight of others, Venus thinks him the most beautiful of all the  divinities.    AEolus keeps the winds under his power in a cave in the AEolian Islands,  where he dwells. He can raise storms and hurricanes, and restrain  their rage at pleasure.    Momus is a jester, mocker, or mimic. His life is spent in idleness,  merely observing the sayings and doings of the gods, and then  censuring and deriding them. For instance, when Neptune was made a  bull, Minerva a house, and Vulcan a man, Momus was appointed to judge  as to whom the greatest skill was manifested in creation. The carping  god disapproved of all. He found fault with the bull for not having  his horns before his eyes in his forehead, that he might be enabled to  push the surer. He condemned the house, because it was fixed and could  not be carried away in case it was placed in a bad neighbourhood. But  the god, he said, who made man, was most imprudent because he did not  make a window in the human breast, that the thoughts might be seen.          CHAPTER X.          Satyrs described--Diana's Retirement--Pallas, the        Goddess of Shepherds and Pasture--The vile        Flora--Pomona deceived--Celestial Nymphs--Terrestrial        Nymphs--River Gods and Goddesses--Sirens--Witch        Circe--Infernal Deities--Passage to Tartarus--Palace        of Pluto--Judges of Hell--Goddesses of        Destiny--Furies--Night, Death, and Sleep: by whom        presided over--Names of Monsters condemned in the        place of Punishment--Tartarian Regions--Delights of        the Elysian Fields--Food and Drink of Pagan        Gods--Festivals of Heathens--Colour of        Gods--Sacrifices to Deities--Things sacred to Gods.      Satyrs are partly of human likeness and partly of bestial shape. They  have heads of human form, with horns and brutish ears; they have  crooked hands, rough hairy bodies, goats' legs and feet and tails. The  chief of these monsters is the god Pan, the inventor of the musical  pipe.    Diana, out of love to Chastity, avoids consort with men, retires into  the woods, and there diverts herself with hunting, whence she is  reckoned the goddess of the woods and the chase. Pallas is esteemed  the goddess of shepherds and pasture, and is the reputed inventress of  corn, and is thought by some to be Ceres or Vesta. Flora is the  goddess of flowers. By a vile trade, she accumulated a vast amount of  money, and made the people of Rome her heirs, who, in return, placed  her among the divinities.    Ferona and Pomona are two goddesses of trees and fruits. The latter  was advised by the god Vertumnus to enter the matrimonial state in the  guise of a hagged old woman; but without success, till he appeared to  her as a fair young man, and then she felt the power of love, and  yielded to his wishes. The Nymphs are a company of neat charming  virgins, living near the gardens of Pomona. They are of three  classes:--1st the Celestial Nymphs, called Genii, who guide the  spheres and dispense the influences of the stars to things on earth.  2nd, the Terrestrial Nymphs, as Dryades, who preside over the woods  and live in the oaks; and Hamadryades, who are born and die with the  oaks; the Oreades, who preside over the mountains; the Napaeae, who  preside over the groves and valleys; the Limnatides, who look after  the meadows and fields. 3rd, Marine Nymphs.    As the chief of the marine and river gods and goddesses, Neptune  stands at the head. He is represented with black hair and blue eyes,  arrayed in a mantle of azure, holding a trident in his right hand, and  embracing his queen with his left arm. He stands upright in his  chariot, drawn by sea horses, and is attended by nymphs. Proteus is  the son of Neptune, but some say he is the offspring of Oceanus and  Tethys. His business is to tend the sea-calves. He can turn himself  into any shape. Triton, the son and trumpeter of Neptune, is a man to  the middle and a dolphin below; he has two fore feet, like those of  horses, and is provided with two tails. Oceanus is the son of C[oe]lum  and Vesta, husband to Tethys, god of the sea, and father of the rivers  and springs. Nereus, also the son of Oceanus and Tethys, is father of  fifty daughters, called Nereides or Sea Nymphs. Palaemon and his mother  Ino, together with the fisherman Glaucus, are reckoned among the sea  deities. The Sirens resemble mermaids, having the faces of women, but  bodies of flying fish. They are reported to be excellent songsters,  that play on the Sicilian coasts, and tempt passengers on shore, where  they sing them asleep and kill them. Scylla and Charybdis are two  other sea monsters. Scylla is the daughter of Phorcys, and beloved by  Glaucus, whom therefore the witch Circe by her enchantments turned  into a rock, with dogs around her. Charybdis is a very ravenous woman,  who stole Hercules's oxen, for which crime Jupiter struck her dead  with a thunder-bolt, and then turned her into a gulf or whirlpool in  the Sicilian Sea. The Sea Nymphs are the Nereides already referred to.  The Naides or Naiades preside over fountains and springs; the  Potameides preside over rivers, and Limniades over lakes.    In noticing the Infernal Deities, we shall describe the dismal  regions, where wicked spirits dwell, and over which they are reported  to preside. The name commonly given to these regions is Hades or  Tartarus, understood to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#18)"],[1,"Gard hear of the Yankee pigs. No  more did he hear of the disgusting Yankee billions. Germany and  America in union would form the blessed state which would command  the globe, and the two excelling peoples, by intermarrying, would  produce a race too far ahead and above Frau Bucher's hoarse  vocabulary to admit of much more than her Ach Himmels and Ach  Gotts.          CHAPTER XXI    A PEOPLE PECULIAR OR PAGAN?      Concurrent with all these lively happenings Kirtley had cultivated  the acquaintance of Miles Anderson. The two became very friendly.  Gard had been so rudely treated by the great German professor in the  lecture room that he was quite willing to conclude he could learn  from the journalist far more of what he was interested in than from  a Teuton university pulpit.    Anderson, like himself, had entered Germany ignorant of the nation  and its folk, and fully disposed to find almost everything worthy  the highest praise. The elder's vivid convictions, his caustic  reflections, were honestly born of what he had seen and heard in  different parts of the land, not of what the Germans said of  themselves in books, as was the customary rule. By virtue of his  calling he had superior opportunities for observation. He was  therefore not a negligible imparter of information.    Gard usually found him in a high-ceilinged, majestic chamber in a  typical Dresden _pension_, frequented, however, by only three or  four boarders. It was a little like a home for Anderson, even if  gloomily august in the German style. Dark woodwork, severely waxed  floors on which Gard often slipped violently, huge doors, huge  chairs and tables--everything large to suit the national taste for  big Teuton gods and supermen. Long, thick stuffs concealed the  passageways and windows and contributed to the absence of cheering  light--that sign and symbol of the Gothic environment and  disposition.    The first question the old man usually plumped was:    \"How's your German going?\"    \"Slowly. Pegging along. I suppose it's because I don't get up much  of a liking for it. There's something about it that goes against my  grain.\"    And then Anderson would be off for that particular session. On one  early occasion he had said, jestingly:    \"I guess you will have to fall back upon the natural method.\"    \"What's that?\" had come back the innocent interrogatory.    \"Take a sweetheart. She will teach you more useful German in a month  than you can learn from the pedagogues in a year. Right here in the  best parts of Dresden are streets where these ladies can be rented  with their rooms per week or per month cheap, with all the German  you want thrown in. Are we to assume it is by this system that the  German universities are able to turn out what the world believes are  the best students?\"    \"I never heard anything about that back home,\" confessed Kirtley,  always letting the bars down to encourage a monologue.    \"Of course not. That would be to interfere with our American  readiness to admit German transcendence.\"    \"But how do you harmonize the frank state of morals here with the  fact that the Germans are the great religious authorities? How have  they established such a reputation abroad for the morality that is  assumed to go with Protestantism?\"    \"That is simple enough. First, by claiming that the French are  degenerate. Second, by retaining religion with its morals as an  adjunct of an unmoral and authoritative militarism. Religion is to  them a topic for expert investigation and study just as is  militarism or any natural product--oil, coal, the chemical elements,  anything. The Teuton specialist goes at it as at any objective  science. His analytical and synthetic processes simply explore in  his own subterranean caverns apropos of theology. He has taken over  the Bible as the Kaiser has taken over Jerusalem. Wilhelm is  becoming the Cerberus of Christianity--sole and surly guardian of  its meanings and influence.    \"But you never see any men in these German churches, do you? They  don't go to church. Nor the women very much. You see old women and  children at worship. This is because the German has always typically  worshipped Gott on the battlefield or in the military camps--out in  the open. The German God is an out-of-doors God and is distinctively  associated with the thought of war. God within walls, within a  church, is a deity of good will on earth. He is a deity of peace.  Naturally this does not appeal to the Goth. He don't pay much  lively attention to God unless there's a war on hand or in immediate  prospect. Then he begins to shout and 'holler' at Him to attract His  attention, because He is so far off from Germany.\"    Gard laughed. Then, after a moment, he asked, almost shyly,    \"If German morals and religion have little necessary  relation--little actual relation--how about love?\"    \"The German would never have known of love if he had not heard it  talked of,\" replied Anderson with responsive geniality, pleased with  Kirtley's amused face. \"Generally an excess of a moral religion  destroys love, just as the absence of it in the past has been apt to  go with an indecent and widespread sensuality. So we have, what is  called, the beastliness in the Teuton. For he has to go, as you  know, to an extreme in things--logical extreme. This is why he is  only partly human, from our standpoint. The human is so constructed  that he can't stand excess in any direction very long and remain  human. Everything has to be diluted, alloyed, temporized for him or  it is not bearable--it will not work successfully.    \"We see this in medicine--conspicuously. Medicines pure from the  hands of Mother Nature are too strong, too rank in their purity, to  be properly effective. They have to be weakened, reduced, compounded  with inferior elements, to be of service. So with Truth. People are  always begging for Truth, seeking the ultimate Truth, as if that  would bring the perfect state of happiness. This is childlike  ignorance. Truth in its pure, perfect condition would simply kill  them--like unadulterated drugs. They could not stand its blinding  light. They could not stand the shock. Like the rest--to change the  metaphor--it has to be made up so largely of shoddy to wear well or  wear at all.    \"Love, the same way. When the world talks of love so much, it means  only friendliness--you like me and I like you--you do something kind  for me and I will do something kind for you. Love in its alloyed  form of friendship is its efficacious shape for universal use. Pure  love, which poor humanity is always reaching out its hands for,  simply--as George Sand said--simply tears people to pieces without  doing them any good. The result is tragedy, despair, wrecked lives,  death before one's time. We see that everywhere depicted in  fiction, in the drama, at the opera.    \"So the German has kept love in a practical state--for him--by  associating it so prominently with his procreative capacities. It is  a case of Mars and Venus producing fighting men.\"    \"If the German is not governed by love as an ideal,\" put in Gard,  \"how is it then that he is so sentimental? People always assure us  that Fritz must be really at bottom as affectionate, tender,  emotional, as anyone because he is so sentimental.\"    \"Yes, that's the old conundrum that the enthusiasts over everything  German confuse one with. The German's fondness--gobbling-down  fondness--for food does not prove that he is a gourmet. The Teuton  sentimentality is like mush. It's principally for children. As Fritz  keeps a good deal of his childishness about him as he grows up, he  keeps this taste for mush. It takes the place of _sentiment_ which  is of the proper mental pabulum for enlightened adults. You can't  write poetry about mush. So the Germans have little poetry worth  talking about. Where their emotional side ought to be, they are  slightly developed beyond the youthful stage of sentiment_alism_.  Their abortive conception of love, their treatment of their women  and children--other things--all account for this naturally enough.  One is rather forced, in spite of himself, to take the Germans at  either of two extremes in order to understand them  candidly--mushiness or iron.\"          CHAPTER XXII    MAKING FOR WAR      Anderson did not care for the Buchers and only came two or three  times to Villa Elsa. So Gard did the calling. The elder would  invariably bring out from his table drawer his \"bachelor's bride\" in  the form of a box of clear Havanas, and the \"lecture\" would begin  again before, what he said, was the most select audience in  Deutschland.    \"Have you heard anything from your spy?\" he queried one day.    \"No. You don't seriously mean that Rudolph--you assume it's  Rudolph--is watching me?\" returned Kirtley, a little disturbed over  the recurrence to this subject. \"What am I guilty of? I'm as  innocent as an unborn lamb.\"    \"Certainly you are. But, my dear boy, what's innocence in Germany?  The Secret Police can make an alien like you a lot of trouble about  nothing. You wouldn't believe how systematic they are, and serious  as stuffed owls. Take my advice and don't do things at too loose  ends as we are apt to over home. But if you do get into trouble,  come to me and I will tell you what to say.    \"Sometimes they even have one spy spying on another in the home. Of  course the spy system, like the army and navy, belongs to the  Kaiser. All the people have to do is to furnish the men and the  money. It's as Heine said, the royal palaces and so forth are owned  by the princes, but the debts owing for them are assumed by the  public. The Hohenzollerns have the property, the Germans have the  obligations.    \"You see, the spy system tends to prevent the Teuton from talking  politics. But he can theorize concerning the State. The State is an  active philosophic concept that holds off the people from discussing  and gossiping about Wilhelm. It does not exist"]]]
