Religion did not command or even permit special inquiries into  these powers; it was not only not man's duty to try to know the gods, it  was his positive duty to try not to. Through the influence of Greece  there had now come into Rome an altogether new idea, nourished largely  by the Sibylline books, and represented most fully in the Magna Mater,  the idea of the perpetual service of a god, a consecration to him, to  the exclusion of all other things, and a life given over to the  orgiastic performance of cult acts, which produced a state of ecstasy  and consequently a communion with the deity. Along with this there went  a belief in the possibility, by means of certain books and certain men,  of obtaining from the gods a knowledge of the future. It is these  surplus beliefs, quite contrary to the spirit of old Roman religion,  which may justly be called superstition.    The Sibylline books had aroused these feelings, a knowledge of the  oracle at Delphi had increased them, the rites of Aesculapius had  carried them farther, but it was not until the Magna Mater came that  they seem to have burst forth in any large degree. But aside from the  rapid growth of the Magna Mater cult itself we have in this second  century two instances of this tendency. The first was connected with the  god Dionysos-Liber, innocent enough at his first reception in B.C. 493,  in the company of Demeter-Ceres and Kore-Libera. To be sure the state  had introduced him merely as the god of wine, but the mystery element in  Dionysos took firm hold on private worship, and the Bacchanalian clubs  or societies began to spread over Italy. In the course of about three  centuries they had become a formidable menace to the morals and even the  physical security of the inhabitants of Rome. Their meetings instead of  occurring three times a year took place five times a month, and finally  in B.C. 186 the famous Bacchanalian trial took place, of which Livy (Bk.  xxxix.) gives such a graphic account, and to which a copy of the  inscription of the decree of the Senate, preserved to our day, gives  such eloquent testimony, providing as it does severe penalties for  subsequent offenders, and recognising on the other hand large liberty of  conscience.    The same love of mystery and longing for knowledge which produced the  Bacchanalian clubs accorded a warm reception to astrology and made men  listen with eagerness to those who could tell their fortunes or guide  their lives by means of the stars. We do not know when the bearers of  this knowledge first arrived in Rome, but Cato, in his _Farm Almanac_,  our earliest piece of prose literature, in giving rules for the  behaviour of the farm bailiff especially enjoins the intending landowner  that his bailiff should not be given to the consultation of Chaldaean  astrologers. Within half a century the problem of the Chaldaeans grew so  serious that state interference was necessary, and in B.C. 139 the  praetor Cn. Cornelius Hispalus issued an edict ordering the Chaldaeans  to leave Rome and Italy within ten days.    The same age which produced this growth of superstition brought also the  antidote for it in the shape of a sceptical philosophy, but the only  trouble was that this philosophy not only cured superstition but in  doing so killed the genuine religious spirit underlying it. It cast out,  to be sure, the seven devils of superstition, but when men returned to  themselves again, they found their whole spiritual house swept and  garnished. With the death of the direct pupils of Aristotle, the Greek  mind had thought out all the problems of philosophy of which man at that  time was able to conceive. The following generations of philosophers  devoted themselves either to the elaboration of detail or to a renewed  examination of the foundations of belief, with the result that their  smaller minds came to smaller conclusions, and the end of their  investigations was one increased scepticism. The schools of the day  showed many slight variations and bore many different names, but they  all agreed in being more or less pervaded by a sceptical spirit, and by  accenting ethics as against metaphysics, though they defined ethics very  differently according to their starting point.    One of the earliest philosophical influences which reached Rome was  however that of a pre-Socratic school, the school of Pythagoras. This  was natural enough in itself, as the headquarters of the school was in  Southern Italy, but it is curious and significant that the first  pronounced instance of its influence occurred shortly after the Second  Punic War, and in connexion with a clever fraud which was perpetrated  with a view to influencing religion. In the year B.C. 181 a certain man  reported that when he was ploughing his field, which lay on the other  side of the Tiber, at the foot of the Janiculum, the plough had laid  bare two stone sarcophagi, stoutly sealed with lead, and bearing  inscriptions in Greek and Latin according to which they purported to  contain, one of them the body of King Numa, the other, his writings.  When they were opened the one which ought to have contained the body was  empty, in the other lay two rolls, each roll consisting of seven books;  the one set of seven was written in Latin and treated of pontifical law,  the other consisted of philosophical writings. They were examined, found  to be heretical and subversive to true religion, and were accordingly  burned in the Comitium. The connexion of Numa and Pythagoras,  historically impossible but believed in at this time, makes it  practically certain that this was a clever attempt to introduce the  philosophy of Pythagoras into Rome under the holy sanction of the name  of Numa. Fortunately the zeal of the city praetor frustrated the scheme.  But the doctrines of philosophy, which thus failed to enter by the door  of religion, found the door of literature wide open for them. As the  irony of fate would have it, Cato, the stalwart enemy of Greek  influence, had brought back from Sardinia with him the poet Ennius, and  at about the time when the false books of Numa were burning in the  Comitium Ennius was giving to the world a Latin translation of the  _Sacred History_ of the Greek Euhemerus. This Euhemerus, a Sicilian who  had lived about a century before this time, earned his title to fame by  writing a novel of adventure and travel, in which he described a trip  which he had taken in the Red Sea along the coast of Arabia to the  wonderful island of Panchaia, where he found a column with an  inscription on it telling the life history of Ouranos, Kronos, and Zeus,  who were thus shown to have been historical characters afterwards  elevated into deities. It was this theological element in his book which  made him famous. This theory of the historical origin of the gods is  even to-day called Euhemerism, and has exerted a baleful influence over  writers on mythology from its author's day down to our own. These then  were the doctrines which Ennius presented to the Romans in their own  tongue, and it is pathetic to realise that his _Sacred History_ formed  the first formal treatise on theology which Rome ever possessed. Born  under such an evil star, it is small wonder that her theological  speculations never reached great metaphysical heights.    In these days it seemed to the Senate that the question of philosophy  was beginning to be so serious that it might be considered as a public  danger, and that it was therefore their duty to try to cope with it.  They chose, of course, the typical Roman method of dealing with such  matters, and the philosophers were expelled from Rome. At first in B.C.  173 it was only the Epicureans who were sent out, but in B.C. 161 the  edict was broadened to include philosophers in general. However six  years later, in B.C. 155, there came to Rome an embassy of philosophers  whose mission was avowedly political and not philosophical, and who thus  could not be excluded, while at the same time they took occasion to  preach their philosophical doctrines. It was fortunate for Rome that  Stoicism, the best among all these philosophies, appealed to her most  strongly and became thus the national philosophy of Rome. Stoicism was  in many respects quite as sceptical as the others, but it had at least  this great advantage that it laid a strong emphasis on ethics, and was  in so far capable of becoming a guide of life. It might be well enough  for Greeks, whose aggressive work in the world had been done, to settle  down to an idle old age with a theory of life which practically excluded  the possibility of strong decisive action, but Rome was still young, and  most of her work was still before her. She might think herself very old  and pretend to take peculiar delight in many of the more decadent forms  of Greek thought, but in reality her leaders instinctively turned to  Stoicism, as affording a compromise between the mere thoughtless  activity of youth, which acts for the love of acting, and the jaded  philosophy of the vanity of all effort. About the middle of the century  (_circa_ B.C. 150) there existed in Rome a centre of culture and  intellectual influence, a little group of men peculiarly interesting,  because they form practically the first instance of an intellectual  coterie in the history of Rome. Their leader was the younger Scipio, who  had as his associates his friend Laelius, the poet Lucilius, whose  brilliant writings, submerged by the more brilliant satires of Horace,  form one of the most deplorable losses in Roman literature, and the  Stoic philosopher Panaitios of Rhodes. Terence had also belonged to the  circle, but he was now dead. Stoicism was the avowed philosophy of these  men, and their influence, especially that of Panaitios and Lucilius, did  much to popularise their chosen philosophical creed.    While"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18233"],[0,"Animal Ghosts; Or, Animal Hauntings and the Hereafter (#18)"],[1,"it is termed the Boggart. Its most  common form in these counties is a large, black dog with flaming eyes;  and its appearance is a certain prognostication of death.    According to tradition there was once a \"Barguest\" in a glen between  Darlington and Houghton, near Throstlenest. Another haunted a piece of  waste land above a spring called the Oxwells, between Wreghorn and  Headingley Hill, near Leeds. On the death of any person of local  importance in the neighbourhood the creature would come forth, followed  by all the other dogs, barking and howling. (Henderson refers to these  hauntings in his _Folk-lore of Northern Counties_.)    Another form of this animal spectre is the Capelthwaite, which,  according to common report, had the power of appearing in the form of  any quadruped, but usually chose that of a large, black dog.      \"_The Mauthe Doog_\"    One of the most famous canine apparitions is that of the \"Mauthe Doog,\"  once said--and, I believe, still said--to haunt Peel Castle, Isle of  Man.    Its favourite place, so I am told, was the guard-chamber, where it used  to crouch by the fireside. The sentry, so the story runs, got so  accustomed to seeing it, that they ceased to be afraid; but, as they  believed it to be of evil origin, waiting for an opportunity to seize  them, they were very particular what they said or did, and refrained  from swearing in its presence. The Mauthe Doog used to come out and  return by the passage through the church, by which the sentry on duty  had to go to deliver the keys every night to the captain. These men,  however, were far too nervous to go alone, and were invariably  accompanied by one of the retainers. On one occasion, however, one of  the sentinels, in a fit of drunken bravado, swore he was afraid of  nothing, and insisted on going alone. His comrades tried to dissuade  him, upon which he became abusive, cursed the Mauthe Doog, and said he  would d----d well strike it. An hour later, he returned absolutely mad  with horror, and speechless; nor could he even make signs, whereby his  friends could understand what had happened to him. He died soon  after--his features distorted--in violent agony. After this the  apparition was never seen again.    As to what class of spirits the spectre dog belongs, that is impossible  to say. At the most we can only surmise, and I should think the chances  of its being the actual phantasm of some dead dog or an elemental are  about equal. It is probably sometimes the one and sometimes the other;  and its origin is very possibly like that of the Banshee.      _Spectral Hounds_    As with the spectre dog, so with packs of hounds, stories of them come  from all parts of the country.    Gervase of Tilbury states that as long ago as the thirteenth century a  pack of spectral hounds was frequently witnessed, on nights when the  moon was full, scampering across forest and downs. In the twelfth  century the pack was known as \"the Herlething\" and haunted, chiefly, the  banks of the Wye.    Roby, in his _Traditions of Lancashire_; Hardwick, in his _Traditions,  Superstitions, and Folk-lore_; Homerton, in his _Isles of Loch Awe_;  Wirt Sykes, in his _British Goblins_; Sir Walter Scott, and others, all  refer to them. In the North of England they are known as \"Gabriel's  Hounds\"; in Devon as the \"Wisk,\" \"Yesk,\" \"Yeth,\" or \"Heath Hounds\"; in  Wales as the \"Cwn Annwn\" or \"Cyn y Wybr\"; in Cornwall as the \"Devil and  his Dandy-Dogs\"; and in the neighbourhood of Leeds as the \"Gabble  Retchets.\" They are common all over the Continent. In appearance they  are usually described as monstrous, human-headed dogs, black, with fiery  eyes and teeth, and sprinkled all over with blood. They make a great  howling noise, which is very shrill and mournful, and appear to be in  hot pursuit of some unseen quarry. When they approach a house, it may be  taken as a certain sign someone in that house will die very shortly.    According to Mr. Roby, a spectre huntsman known by the name Gabriel  Ratchets, accompanied by a pack of phantom hounds, is said to hunt a  milk-white doe round the Eagle's Crag in the Vale of Todmorden every All  Hallows Eve.    These hounds were also seen in Norfolk. A famous ecclesiast, when on his  way to the coast, was forced to spend the night in the King's Lynn Inn,  owing to a violent snowstorm. Retiring to bed directly after supper, he  tried to forget his disappointment in reading a volume of sermons he had  bought at a second-hand shop in Bury St. Edmunds.    \"I think I can use this one,\" he said to himself. \"It will do nicely for  the people of Aylesham. They are so steeped in hypocrisy that nothing  short of violent denunciation will bring it home to them. This I think,  however, will pierce even their skins.\"    A sudden noise made him spring up.    \"Hounds!\" he exclaimed. \"And at this time of night! Good heavens!\"    He flew to the window, and there, careering through the yard, baying as  they ran, were, at least, fifty luminous, white hounds. Instead of  leaping the stone wall, they passed right through it, and the bishop  then realized that they were Gabriel Hounds. The following evening he  received tidings of his son's--his only son's--death.    I have heard that the \"Yeth Hounds\" were seen, not so long ago, in a  parish in Yorkshire by an old poacher called Barnes. Barnes was walking  in the fields one night, when he suddenly heard the baying of the  hounds, and the hoarse shouts of the huntsman. The next moment the whole  pack hove in view and tore past him so close that he received a cut from  \"the whip\" on his leg. To his surprise, however, it did not hurt him, it  only felt icy cold. He then knew that he had seen the \"Yeth Hounds.\"      _A Spectral Pack of Hounds in Russia_    A gentleman of the name of Rappaport whom I once met in Southampton told  me of an experience he had once had with a spectral pack of hounds on  the slope of the Urals. \"It was about half-past eleven one winter's  night,\" he said, \"and I was driving through a thick forest, when my  coachman suddenly leaned back in his seat and called out, 'Do you hear  that?' I listened, and from afar came a plaintive, whining sound. 'It's  not Volki, is it?' I asked. 'I'm afraid so, master,' the coachman  replied, 'they're coming on after us.'    \"'But they are some way off still!' I said.    \"'That is so,' he responded, 'but wolves run quick, and our horses are  tired. If we can reach the lake first we shall be all right, but should  they overtake us before we get there--' and he shrugged his great  shoulders suggestively. 'Not another word,' I cried. 'Drive--drive as if  'twere the devil himself. I have my rifle ready, and will shoot the  first wolf that shows itself.'    \"'Very good, master,' he answered. 'I will do everything that can be  done to save your skin and mine.' He cracked his whip, and away flew the  horses at a breakneck speed. But fast as they went, they could not  outstrip the sound of the howling, which gradually drew nearer and  nearer, until around the curve we had just passed shot into view a huge  gaunt wolf. I raised my rifle and fired. The beast fell, but another  instantly took its place, and then another and another, till the whole  pack came into sight, and close behind us was an ocean of white,  tossing, foam-flecked jaws and red gleaming eyes.    \"I emptied my rifle into them as fast as I could pull the trigger, but  it only checked them momentarily. A few snaps, and of their wounded  brethren there was nothing left but a pile of glistening bones. Then,  hie away, and they were once again in red-hot pursuit. At last our pace  slackened, and still I could see no signs of the lake. A great grey  shape, followed by others, then rushed by us and tried to reach the  horses' flanks with their sharp, gleaming teeth. A few more seconds,  and I knew we should be both fighting, back to back, the last great  fight for existence. Indeed I had ceased firing, and was already  beginning to strike out furiously with the butt end of my rifle, when a  new sound arrested my attention. The baying of dogs! 'Dogs!' I screamed,  'Dogs, Ivan!' (that was the coachman's name) 'Dogs!' and, in my mad joy,  I brained two wolves in as many blows. The next moment a large pack of  enormous white hounds came racing down on us. The wolves did not wait to  dispute the field; they all turned tail and, with loud howls of terror,  rushed off in the direction they had come. On came the hounds--more  beautiful dogs I had never seen; as they swept by, more than one brushed  against my knees, though I could feel nothing save intense cold. When  they were about twenty yards ahead of us, they slowed down, and  maintained that distance in front of us till we arrived on the shores of  the lake. There they halted, and throwing back their heads, bayed as if  in farewell, and suddenly vanished. We knew then that they were no  earthly hounds, but spirit ones, sent by a merciful Providence to save  us from a cruel death.\"          CHAPTER III    HORSES AND THE UNKNOWN      As in my chapters on cats and dogs, I will preface this chapter on  horses with instances of alleged haunted localities.    I take my first case from Mr. W.T. Stead's _Real Ghost Stories_,  published in 1891. It is called \"A Weird Story from the Indian Hills,\"  and Mr. Stead preludes it thus: The \"tale is told by General Barter,  C.B., of Careystown, Whitegate, Co. Cork. At the time he witnessed the  spectral cavalcade he was living on the hills in India, and when one  evening he was returning home he caught sight of a rider and attendants  coming towards him. The rest of the story, given in the General's own  words, is as follows:--    \"At this time the two dogs came, and, crouching at my side, gave low,  frightened whimpers. The moon was at the full--a tropical moon--so  bright that you could see to read a newspaper by its light, and--I saw  the party before me advance as plainly as it were noon day."]]]
