Listen.  Go out without delay.  Remain out--at a hotel, where you will,  but do not stay here.\"    \"And Nayland Smith?\"    \"What is he to me, this Nayland Smith?  Ah, why will you not unseal my  lips?  You are in danger--you hear me, in danger!  Go away from here  to-night.\"    She dropped her hands and ran from the room.  In the open doorway she  turned, stamping her foot passionately.    \"You have hands and arms,\" she cried, \"and yet you let me go.  Be  warned, then; fly from here--\" She broke off with something that  sounded like a sob.    I made no move to stay her--this beautiful accomplice of the  arch-murderer, Fu-Manchu. I heard her light footsteps pattering down  the stairs, I heard her open and close the door--the door of which Dr.  Fu-Manchu held the key.  Still I stood where she had parted from me,  and was so standing when a key grated in the lock and Nayland Smith  came running up.    \"Did you see her?\" I began.    But his face showed that he had not done so, and rapidly I told him of  my strange visitor, of her words, of her warning.    \"How can she have passed through London in that costume?\" I cried in  bewilderment.  \"Where can she have come from?\"    Smith shrugged his shoulders and began to stuff broad-cut mixture into  the familiar cracked briar.    \"She might have traveled in a car or in a cab,\" he said; \"and  undoubtedly she came direct from the house of Dr. Fu-Manchu.  You  should have detained her, Petrie.  It is the third time we have had  that woman in our power, the third time we have let her go free.\"    \"Smith,\" I replied, \"I couldn't. She came of her own free will to give  me a warning.  She disarms me.\"    \"Because you can see she is in love with you?\" he suggested, and burst  into one of his rare laughs when the angry flush rose to my cheek.  \"She is, Petrie why pretend to be blind to it?  You don't know the  Oriental mind as I do; but I quite understand the girl's position.  She  fears the English authorities, but would submit to capture by you!  If  you would only seize her by the hair, drag her to some cellar, hurl her  down and stand over her with a whip, she would tell you everything she  knows, and salve her strange Eastern conscience with the reflection  that speech was forced from her.  I am not joking; it is so, I assure  you.  And she would adore you for your savagery, deeming you forceful  and strong!\"    \"Smith,\" I said, \"be serious.  You know what her warning meant before.\"    \"I can guess what it means now,\" he rapped.  \"Hallo!\"    Someone was furiously ringing the bell.    \"No one at home?\" said my friend.  \"I will go.  I think I know what it  is.\"    A few minutes later he returned, carrying a large square package.    \"From Weymouth,\" he explained, \"by district messenger.  I left him  behind at the docks, and he arranged to forward any evidence which  subsequently he found.  This will be fragments of the mummy.\"    \"What!  You think the mummy was abstracted?\"    \"Yes, at the docks.  I am sure of it; and somebody else was in the  sarcophagus when it reached Rowan House.  A sarcophagus, I find, is  practically airtight, so that the use of the rubber stopper becomes  evident--ventilation.  How this person killed Strozza I have yet to  learn.\"    \"Also, how he escaped from a locked room.  And what about the green  mist?\"    Nayland Smith spread his hands in a characteristic gesture.    \"The green mist, Petrie, can be explained in several ways.  Remember,  we have only one man's word that it existed.  It is at best a confusing  datum to which we must not attach a factitious importance.\"    He threw the wrappings on the floor and tugged at a twine loop in the  lid of the square box, which now stood upon the table.  Suddenly the  lid came away, bringing with it a lead lining, such as is usual in  tea-chests. This lining was partially attached to one side of the box,  so that the action of removing the lid at once raised and tilted it.    Then happened a singular thing.    Out over the table billowed a sort of yellowish-green cloud--an oily  vapor--and an inspiration, it was nothing less, born of a memory and of  some words of my beautiful visitor, came to me.    \"RUN, SMITH!\" I screamed.  \"The door! the door, for your life!  Fu-Manchu sent that box!\"  I threw my arms round him.  As he bent  forward the moving vapor rose almost to his nostrils.  I dragged him  back and all but pitched him out on to the landing.  We entered my  bedroom, and there, as I turned on the light, I saw that Smith's tanned  face was unusually drawn, and touched with pallor.    \"It is a poisonous gas!\" I said hoarsely; \"in many respects identical  with chlorine, but having unique properties which prove it to be  something else--God and Fu-Manchu, alone know what!  It is the fumes of  chlorine that kill the men in the bleaching powder works.  We have been  blind--I particularly.  Don't you see?  There was no one in the  sarcophagus, Smith, but there was enough of that fearful stuff to have  suffocated a regiment!\"    Smith clenched his fists convulsively.    \"My God!\" he said, \"how can I hope to deal with the author of such a  scheme?  I see the whole plan.  He did not reckon on the mummy case  being overturned, and Kwee's part was to remove the plug with the aid  of the string--after Sir Lionel had been suffocated.  The gas, I take  it, is heavier than air.\"    \"Chlorine gas has a specific gravity of 2.470,\" I said; \"two and a half  times heavier than air.  You can pour it from jar to jar like a  liquid--if you are wearing a chemist's mask.  In these respects this  stuff appears to be similar; the points of difference would not  interest you.  The sarcophagus would have emptied through the vent, and  the gas have dispersed, with no clew remaining--except the smell.\"    \"I did smell it, Petrie, on the stopper, but, of course, was unfamiliar  with it.  You may remember that you were prevented from doing so by the  arrival of Sir Lionel?  The scent of those infernal flowers must  partially have drowned it, too.  Poor, misguided Strozza inhaled the  stuff, capsized the case in his fall, and all the gas--\"    \"Went pouring under the conservatory door, and down the steps, where  Kwee was crouching.  Croxted's breaking the window created sufficient  draught to disperse what little remained.  It will have settled on the  floor now.  I will go and open both windows.\"    Nayland raised his haggard face.    \"He evidently made more than was necessary to dispatch Sir Lionel  Barton,\" he said; \"and contemptuously--you note the attitude,  Petrie?--contemptuously devoted the surplus to me.  His contempt is  justified.  I am a child striving to cope with a mental giant.  It is  by no wit of mine that Dr. Fu-Manchu scores a double failure.\"        CHAPTER XIII      I WILL tell you, now of a strange dream which I dreamed, and of the  stranger things to which I awakened.  Since, out of a blank--a  void--this vision burst in upon my mind, I cannot do better than relate  it, without preamble.  It was thus:    I dreamed that I lay writhing on the floor in agony indescribable.  My  veins were filled with liquid fire, and but that stygian darkness was  about me, I told myself that I must have seen the smoke arising from my  burning body.    This, I thought, was death.    Then, a cooling shower descended upon me, soaked through skin and  tissue to the tortured arteries and quenched the fire within.  Panting,  but free from pain, I lay--exhausted.    Strength gradually returning to me, I tried to rise; but the carpet  felt so singularly soft that it offered me no foothold.  I waded and  plunged like a swimmer treading water; and all about me rose  impenetrable walls of darkness, darkness all but palpable.  I wondered  why I could not see the windows.  The horrible idea flashed to my mind  that I was become blind!    Somehow I got upon my feet, and stood swaying dizzily.  I became aware  of a heavy perfume, and knew it for some kind of incense.    Then--a dim light was born, at an immeasurable distance away.  It grew  steadily in brilliance.  It spread like a bluish-red stain--like a  liquid.  It lapped up the darkness and spread throughout the room.    But this was not my room!  Nor was it any room known to me.    It was an apartment of such size that its dimensions filled me with a  kind of awe such as I never had known:  the awe of walled vastness.  Its immense extent produced a sensation of sound.  Its hugeness had a  distinct NOTE.    Tapestries covered the four walls.  There was no door visible.  These  tapestries were magnificently figured with golden dragons; and as the  serpentine bodies gleamed and shimmered in the increasing radiance,  each dragon, I thought, intertwined its glittering coils more closely  with those of another.  The carpet was of such richness that I stood  knee-deep in its pile.  And this, too, was fashioned all over with  golden dragons; and they seemed to glide about amid the shadows of the  design--stealthily.    At the farther end of the hall--for hall it was--a huge table with  dragons' legs stood solitary amid the luxuriance of the carpet.  It  bore scintillating globes, and tubes that held living organisms, and  books of a size and in such bindings as I never had imagined, with  instruments of a type unknown to Western science--a heterogeneous  litter quite indescribable, which overflowed on to the floor, forming  an amazing oasis in a dragon-haunted desert of carpet.  A lamp hung  above this table, suspended by golden chains from the ceiling--which  was so lofty that, following the chains upward, my gaze lost itself in  the purple shadows above.    In a chair piled high with dragon-covered cushions a man sat behind  this table.  The light from the swinging lamp fell fully upon one side  of his face, as he leaned forward amid the jumble of weird objects, and  left the other side in purplish shadow.  From a plain brass bowl upon  the corner of the huge table smoke writhed"]]]
