Every student  who wishes to make a lively representation in carving of familiar beast  or bird should study Bewick's engravings of \"Quadrupeds\" and \"Birds.\"    Drawings made for the purpose of study need not be elaborate: indeed,  such drawings are only embarrassing to work from. The most practical  plan is to make a drawing in which the main masses are given correctly,  and in about the same relative position that they will occupy in the  carving. I give you in Plate VII an example of this in a drawing made by  Philip Webb, who, by the study of a lifetime, has amassed a valuable  store of knowledge concerning animals, and acquired that extraordinary  skill in their delineation and the expression of character which is only  to be attained by close observation and great sympathy with the subject.  The drawing in question was made for myself at the time I was carving a  lion for the cover of a book (given in Plate VIII). It was made, in his  good-natured way, to \"help a lame dog over a stile,\" as I had got into  difficulties with the form. This drawing is all that a carver's first  diagram should be, and gives what is always the first necessity in such  preliminary outlines--that is, the right relationship of the main  masses, and the merest hint of what is to come in the way of detail; all  of which must be studied separately, but which would be entirely  useless if a wrong start had been made. In Fig. 68 I give you tracings  from some notes I made myself while carving the sheep in Plates V and  VI. The object was to gain some definite knowledge of form by noting the  relation of planes, sections of parts, projections, etc., etc. The  section lines and side-notes are the most valuable part of the  memoranda. In the same manner the illustration, Fig. 69, shows diagrams  made from a heron, giving section lines of beak, etc.    The side-notes about the colors are valuable, as, although not  translatable into carving, they do to some extent influence the manner  of interpreting forms.    Photographs must not be despised, but they are only of use if read by  the light of previous knowledge. For this reason you can not make too  many notes of sectional structure through heads, necks, and legs, which  will help to explain the mystery common to all photographs.    The bear shown in the frontispiece is traced from a photographic  illustration which appeared in the Westminster Budget some time ago. By  the merest accident it is suggestive of a subject almost ready for the  carver's hand.    [Illustration: FIG. 68.]    [Illustration: FIG. 69.]      Until tourists began to explore the beauties of Switzerland, there were  no better carvers of animals than the serious but genial craftsmen of  that noble country, more especially of such animals as were familiar to  their eyes. This preeminence shows distinct signs of soon becoming a  thing of the past in the endeavors to meet the demands created by  thoughtless visitors. Still, it is possible to obtain a little of the  traditional work, uninfluenced by that fatal impetus originating in  modern commerce. A piece of this kind is shown in Fig. 70, bought by a  friend only a year or two ago in the Grindelwald, and which, although  forming part of the usual stock of such things made for tourist  consumption, was picked out with judicious discrimination from a number  of stupid and trivial objects which displayed neither interest of design  nor other than mechanical skill of carving. This little bear, a few  inches in size, is carved in a way which shows long experience of the  subject, and great familiarity with the animal's ways. The tooling of  the hair is done with the most extraordinary skill, and without the  waste of a single touch. Now, a word or two more on studies from the  life before we leave this subject. I have given you examples of  diagrams made for this purpose, but much may be done without any  drawings, further than a preliminary map of the general masses. In the  case of such an animal as the horse, which can be seen in every street,  I have myself found it useful to follow them in my walks, taking mental  note of such details as I happened to be engaged upon, such as its legs  and joints, its head or neck; another day I would confine my attention  to eyes, ears, mane, etc., always with reference to the work  immediately in hand, as that is the time to get the best results from  life study; because the difficulties have presented themselves, and one  knows exactly what to look for. Five minutes spent thus after the work  has been started (provided the start has been right and involves no  mistake in the general masses) is more valuable than hours of labor in  making preliminary drawings.    [Illustration: FIG. 70.]    The use of experimental models in clay or wax has, of course, its  advantages, but it will be well to know just how far such an aid is  valuable, and at what point its use becomes hurtful to one's work. It is  a common practise in large carving shops for one man to design the  figure or animal subjects in clay, while another carves them in stone or  wood. Now, apart from the difference in material and the unnatural  \"division of labor,\" which we have discussed before, it is beyond  question that a model of this kind has even a more paralyzing effect on  the actual carver than a drawing would have. Of course, the work is more  certain to reach a recognized standard, and the risk of total failure is  reduced to a minimum, but there is literally nothing left for the  carver to invent; who, if he is a man with a turn for that kind of  thing, and of a nervous temperament, must suffer untold irritation in  its execution. The good and bad results of the use of a modeled pattern  attend in a modified degree even where both are done by the same hand,  but for all that it is a useful and convenient way of making experiments  in doubtful passages of the work. The \"how far\" a model is to be carried  must be regulated by the amount of confidence the carver has in his own  foresight, but in any case it is always well to remember the difference  of treatment required in plaster, clay, and hard wood, which lead to  such different results that often fresh difficulty arises in having to  translate the one manner into the other. For the purpose of roughing out  the general scheme, the clay, if it must be resorted to, should be used  in soft masses, then a drawing in outline made from this; but all  doubtful detailed work should be carved, not modeled, and for this  purpose the clay should be allowed to harden until it is nearly dry.    The opinions of the well-known wood-carver, Mr. W. Aumonier, on this  subject, will be of value to you; he says with regard to the best  method of going to work: \"A fresh piece of wood-carving executed without  a model is distinctly a created work,\" and that much good work may come  by \"chopping boldly at a block without any preconceived design, but  designing as you go on.\" But he thinks it is best to work from drawings;  \"rough, full-size charcoal cartoons, which give the effect wanted by  their light and shade.\" He also says that he \"strongly protests against  the too frequent use of clay or plaster models, because they are often  worse than useless, and not infrequently absolutely immoral in their  tendency, because they absorb time and money, which ought more  legitimately to be spent on the carving itself.\"          CHAPTER XXI    FORESHORTENING AS APPLIED TO WORK IN RELIEF           Intelligible Background Outline Better than Confused       Foreshortening--Superposition of Masses.      I have spoken of the necessity for careful balance between the outlines  of subject and background: that both should be agreeable in shape. This  becomes complicated and more difficult to arrange when we admit into our  design anything resembling what painters call foreshortening, and the  awkwardness is felt even in the placing of such a small thing as an  apple-leaf, which may be treated in such a way that the intention of the  drawing is entirely lost in the confusion which arises between the  inferred and the actual projection.    In designing such subjects it will be good to bear in mind as a guiding  principle that no matter what excuse there may be in the nature of the  inferred position of the leaf or limb, the outline against the  background must be at once agreeable and explanatory.    Every kind of work in relief develops a species of compromise in the  expression of form, lying somewhere between the representation of an  object on a perfectly flat ground, as in a painting, and the complete  realization of the same form, copied from nature in some solid material,  without any background whatever. In proportion to the amount of actual  projection from the background, of course the necessity diminishes for  that kind of foreshortening which is obtained by delineation. It might  be inferred, therefore, that in very low relief--which is more nearly  akin to the nature of a picture--more liberty may be taken in this  direction. It is not so, however, for where actual depth or projection  exists, as in carving, be it only so much as the depth of a line, it  makes foreshortening well-nigh impossible, except to a very limited  extent. There must be, of course, _some_ appearance of this quality, so  a certain conventional standard has been set up, beyond which one only  ventures at one's own risk. Thus, care is taken that every object  composing the subject lies with its _longest lines_ parallel to the  background. In this way the least possible violence is done to the  imagination in completing the picture. As an example, no single leaf  should be represented in relief as turning or coming forward more than  it would do if plucked from the tree and laid loosely down upon a sheet  of paper. A, Fig. 71, is an outline of an apple-leaf pressed out flat.
