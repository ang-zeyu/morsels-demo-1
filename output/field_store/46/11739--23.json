He was striking out wildly  and spluttering at the same time, showing that he had gone overboard  with his mouth open and had swallowed some of the water. One hand and  shoulder were covered with mud from the river bottom, for at that  particular point the stream was less than five feet deep.    \"Oh, he'll be drowned! I know he'll be drowned!\" screamed Codfish in  terror.    \"You shut up, you little imp!\" burst out Gif. \"You'll arouse the whole  school, and there is no need of doing that.\"    By this time Nappy Martell was close to the river bank, and he reached  up his hand appealingly to those above him.    \"Here, give me your hand, Nappy!\" cried Slugger Brown, and reached down  to aid his crony. But the bank was a slippery and treacherous one, and  he was in danger of going overboard himself.    \"Wait a minute, Slugger--let me help you,\" cried Spouter, and he took  hold of the big youth's left hand.    Then the others also came forward to do what they could, and in a few  seconds more Nappy Martell was hauled up on the grass. He was pretty  well exhausted and panted painfully.    \"I'm sorry you went overboard, Martell,\" said Jack, promptly. \"I didn't  expect to knock you into the river.\"    \"You did it on purpose! You know you did!\" returned the other youth  wrathfully. \"Yo--you--d--d--don't know how to f--f--fight fair,\" he  added, his teeth suddenly beginning to chatter, for the unexpected bath  at this season had proved awfully cold.    \"Say! he's shivering like a leaf!\" cried Fred.    \"You had better get back to the Hall and change your clothing,\" advised  Jack.    \"I won't change anything until I've given you a licking,\" roared Nappy  Martell.    \"Oh, say, Nappy, you had better call it off for to-night,\" interposed  Slugger Brown. \"You can't fight in those wet clothes. Finish it some  other time.\"    \"I won't!\" came the ejaculation, and then the dripping boy hurled  himself once more at Jack.    But he was blinded by water and mud as well as by rage; and the oldest  Rover boy easily evaded the new onslaught. Then, of a sudden, he  reached out and caught Martell by both wrists and held him in a  vise-like grasp.    \"Now, see here, Martell, don't be foolish,\" he said sternly. \"I don't  want to fight a fellow who has been overboard and is wringing wet.  You'll catch your death of cold hanging around here in this night air.  Go on back to the Hall and change your clothing. If you want to finish  this some other time, I'll be ready for you.\"    \"That's the talk!\" added Spouter.    \"It would be foolish to go on in this condition,\" remarked Gif. \"Call  it off, by all means.\"    \"You might as well do it,\" came from Slugger Brown. \"You wouldn't have  any kind of a fair show, Nappy--after having been in the river, and  after having had to lick the other Rover first.\"    \"He didn't lick me!\" burst out Fred, indignantly.    More words followed, but in the end Nappy Martell consented to return  to the Hall and went off in company with Slugger Brown, Codfish, and  one or two more friends who had chanced to come up.    \"You'll have to slip in on the sly, or else somebody may ask some  unpleasant questions,\" remarked Slugger Brown on the way to the school.    \"You lend me your coat, and I'll take mine off and make a bundle of  it,\" answered Martell; and so it was arranged. The others clustered  around the dripping youth and thus they managed to get him to his room  without being detected.    \"He'll never forgive you, Jack, for knocking him into the river,\" said  Randy, while the Rovers and their friends walked slowly back to the  Hall.    \"I guess you're right,\" was the answer.    \"And what is more, he'll probably try to play some underhanded trick on  you,\" added Andy.    \"I wish I had had the chance--I think I could have knocked him out  myself,\" broke in Fred. \"I'm not afraid of him, even if he is bigger  than I am.\"    All those who had witnessed the contest were cautioned to keep quiet  about it. Yet in a school like Colby Hall it was next to impossible to  keep the particulars of the affair from circulating, and before long  many of the cadets knew the truth. The majority were of the opinion  that Jack could readily have defeated Martell had the contest been  fought to a finish.    \"He'll undoubtedly lay for you, Jack,\" remarked Fred that night, in  talking the matter over in their rooms.    \"Maybe he'll lay for you, Fred,\" smiled his big cousin. \"You had better  keep your eyes peeled.\"    \"I guess we had better all watch out,\" was Randy's comment.    But for the next few days Nappy Martell, as well as his particular  crony, Slugger Brown, kept to themselves, while Codfish was so timid  that he hardly dared to show himself.    About a week, including Sunday, went by, and the school began to settle  down to its regular routine of studies. The Rover boys had had all  their classes mapped out for them, and had also been assigned to a  class in gymnasium work. Gymnastics especially suited the agile Andy,  who nearly always preferred action to sitting still. The Rover boys on  leaving home had promised their parents that they would pay strict  attention to their studies, and now they did their best in that  direction. Of course, some of the lessons were rather hard, and Fred,  being the youngest, often found he needed assistance from the others.    During those days they quickly discovered why Dan Soppinger had been  referred to by one of their friends as the \"human question mark.\" Dan  always wanted to know something, and he did not hesitate to ask for  information on any and all occasions, no matter what else might happen  to be under discussion at the time.    \"He'll die asking questions,\" remarked Andy. \"I never knew a fellow who  could fire questions at a person so rapidly.\"    It was now ideal weather for football, and as soon as the school became  settled football talk filled the air. Gif Garrison had been at the head  of the football eleven the Fall previous, and now he was looked upon to  whip the new team into shape.    \"We generally play three games with outside schools,\" explained Gif to  the Rovers one day. \"First we play Hixley High. Then we play the  Clearwater Country Club. And after that we wind up usually with our big  game with Columbus Academy.\"    \"It must be great sport,\" answered Jack.    \"Did you ever get a chance to play football in New York?\"    \"Oh, yes, we occasionally played a game.\"    \"Jack would make a first-rate football player if he had the chance,\"  put in Randy. \"I've seen him play, and I know.\"    \"Yes. And Fred makes a pretty good player, too,\" added Andy. \"Of  course, he's small and light in weight, but he's as quick on his feet  as they make 'em.\"    \"How about you and Randy?\" questioned Gif.    \"Oh, we never cared very much to play football. We'd rather have some  fun in the crowd looking on,\" was the answer of the twin.    At this, the football leader smiled. \"Well, we've got to have some kind  of an audience--otherwise there wouldn't be any fun in pulling off a  game.\" He looked at Jack and Fred, thoughtfully. \"I'm going to keep you  two fellows in mind, and if I can put one or both of you on the team,  I'll do it. Of course, you'll have your try-outs on the scrub first.\"    \"Well, you can put me on the scrub as soon as you please,\" answered  Jack, promptly.    \"I'll be glad of the chance,\" added Fred.    As was to be expected, no sooner had the boys attempted to settle down  at Colby Hall than they began to want for a number of things which they  had failed to bring from home. These articles were, for the most part,  of small consequence; yet the boys could not get along very well  without them, and so resolved on the following Saturday, which was a  holiday, to walk down to Haven Point and do some shopping.    \"I'd like first rate to take a look around the town, too,\" said Randy.  \"It looked like a pretty good sort of place.\"    \"Maybe we can go to the moving picture show there,\" put in his brother.  \"We'll have time enough.\"    \"Perhaps--if the films look worth while,\" answered Jack.    They had already learned that the moving picture show in the town was  of the better class, and that the pupils of the school were allowed to  attend a performance whenever they had time to do so.    It did not take the four cousins long to walk the distance to Haven  Point. They left the school directly after lunch, and inside of an hour  had purchased the various small articles which they desired. Then all  headed for the moving picture theater, which was located on the main  street in the busiest portion of that thoroughfare.    As the boys walked up to the booth to purchase their admission tickets,  they saw a bevy of girls just entering the door. They were all well  dressed and chatting gaily.    \"Nice bunch, all right,\" was Randy's comment. \"I wonder where they are  from?\"    \"I think I know,\" answered Jack. \"Spouter was telling me there is a  girls' school on the other side of this town, called Clearwater Hall.  It's about as large as Colby Hall. More than likely those girls come  from that school.\"    \"I wish we knew them,\" said Andy. \"I wonder if some of the cadets from  our school don't know them.\"    \"More than likely some of our fellows know some of the girls,\" said  Jack. \"We may be able to become acquainted with them some day.\"          CHAPTER XVI    AT THE MOVING PICTURE THEATER      The moving picture theater was large enough to hold several hundred  people, and when the boys entered they found the place almost full.    \"There are some seats--over on the left,\" remarked Jack, as he pointed  them out. \"Two in one row and two directly behind.\"    \"Why not two in one row and two directly in front?\" returned Andy,  gaily, and then headed for the seats.    \"You and Fred had better sit in front, and Randy and I can take the  back seats,\" went on Jack; and so it was arranged.

A few months back, the discovery of diamonds had brought fame to this  wind-swept wilderness, and fame had been immediately followed by the  choicest collection of cosmopolitan scoundreldom that a mining \"rush\"  had ever been responsible for.    Now Dick Sydney, though a man of variegated experience and a bit of a  \"hard case,\" was still passing honest, and a gentleman; and he soon  found that he stood but little chance in Luderitzbucht. His modest  capital, which he had hoped to increase in this new Diamondopolis, had  vanished within a few weeks of his arrival, swallowed up by shares in  diamond-fields that existed only in the vivid imagination of the  swindling \"company-promoters\" or so-called \"prospectors,\" who infested  the place; and when his illusions of easily-made wealth had vanished  also, and he had tried to obtain a billet, he had failed utterly.    His knock-about experiences had included several spells of gold-  prospecting and mining in California and other wild spots, and, being  as hard as nails, he was admirably suited to the life of a prospector,  and prospectors were being paid large salaries in those early days of  the diamond rush in German South-West Africa. But, unfortunately for  himself, Dick possessed a constitutional but at times embarrassing  prejudice against lying, and in his numerous applications about  prospecting jobs had made no secret of the fact that his prospecting  had never been for diamonds.    And as a result he had had to stand aside and see all sorts of gentry  taken on for the numerous expeditions that were constantly being  arranged: runaway seamen, cooks, stewards, and stokers from the ships,  gangers and navvies from the railways, ne'er-do-wells of all  descriptions, with but here and there an old \"river digger,\" or genuine  prospector to leaven the lump.    Added to his stubborn and uncompromising honesty, Dick possessed  another trait which severely handicapped him in this German-governed  dust-hole of creation, in that he was uncompromisingly British, and  took no pains to conceal the fact; and here in Luderitzbucht the  arrogance of the German officials, and the way in which they boasted of  Their Army, and Their Kaiser, and Their Beer, and Their Sauerkraut,  and, in short, of every product of their whole blamed Fatherland,  exasperated Dick to a degree. Though not very big, he was a bundle of  muscle and sinew, and already he had been fined heavily for making a  mess of one or two spread-eagled Teutons who had been unwise enough to  mistake his quiet manner for timidity.    Dick strolled back over the low-lying sand-dunes to the little  township, where lights were already twinkling in the stores and beer-  halls; and, passing the largest of these, he suddenly realized that he  was thirsty, and, momentarily forgetting the state of his finance, he  turned into the bar for a bottle of beer. The brightly-lit room was  full of people, naturally mostly Germans, who, whilst imbibing vast  quantities of their national beverage, were singing, bragging and  swearing at the top of their voices, and after the manner of their  kind. At the farther end of the room a big corpulent swashbuckler was  holding forth loudly to a circle of admiring cronies; his peroration  was an introduction to a toast; that toast was \"To the Day!\"    Dick had heard it frequently of late; in fact, wherever Germans and  beer came together, that toast was being drank at the time.    \"The Day!\" . . . Dick, and every other Britisher knew what \"Day\" was  meant, and as a rule took but little notice of these fire-eating gas-  bags; anyway, though he understood German, he spoke it but little. And  so he stood quietly imbibing his bottle of beer whilst Bombastus  Furiosis still held forth. His quiet attitude evidently misled the  orator, whose guttural German became mixed with quite enough English to  make his remarks perfectly understandable to the few Britishers amongst  the crowd.    Boasting and bragging, and with his discourse liberally garnished with  \"Donner-wetters,\" and such-like meteorological expressions dear to the  Teuton, this big chap let the world at large know what would happen on  the great \"Day\"; when the whole \"schwein-hund\" Englander nation would,  at long last, be knocked sky-high and to everlasting flinders by the  ineffable and invincible Army of Kaiser Wilhelm II.    Dick got tired of the drunken man's blatant boasting, and finished his  beer with the intention of leaving the bar before he lost his temper,  but as he put down the empty mug he realized with consternation that he  had not the wherewithal to pay for the drink! He stood embarrassed and  irresolute. What could he say to excuse himself how explain before this  crowd of contemptuous Germans?    At that moment, however, something happened to put the matter out of  his mind entirely. The orator had gone one better, and was now  describing what various kinds of \"schwein-hunden\" all Britishers were,  and those in Luderitzbucht in particular, when suddenly a small man,  who had been sitting quietly in a corner of the room, left his seat,  and, walking up to the group, called out, \"'Ere, you with the mouth!  Shut yer fat head abaht Englishmen or I'll make yer! I'm English. Wot  yer got to say abaht it?\"    A roar of laughter went up from the Germans, any of whom looked big  enough to eat the small man. Dick pushed nearer to the group. He knew  the chap now--he was a little Cockney Jew, a bookmaker, horse-dealer,  and what not, scarcely the kind of chap to be expected to show pluck  and patriotism, yet these are often met with in the most unexpected  places. There he stood, opposite a German big enough to eat him and in  fluent Cockney he proceeded to tell that big man more about himself  than is good for any fat man to know.    Of course it could not last long. The jeering laughter changed to  threats and curses, and then suddenly the colossus made a terrific  round-arm all-embracing swipe at that small man, calculated to  obliterate him once for all. But he wasn't there when it arrived; and,  to Dick's joy and amazement, he saw the little Jew dodge in under the  stroke, and with a spring and a lightning blow on the point bring down  the big bully with a crash to the floor.    \"A boxer, by gad!\" yelled Dick, capering with excitement; \"bravo,  little 'un!\" But the small man's victory was only that of a moment. The  next the whole crowd had flung themselves upon him, and the miniature  champion of \"Rule Britannia\" was borne to the ground in the centre of a  whirl of legs, arms, chairs, bottles, and the other weapons usually  preferred by the German larrikin to bare fists.    Dick could stand no more, and the members of that Peace Conference must  have thought about that time that a cyclone had struck them.    It was no time for fancy boxing. Two men who faced Dick went down like  ninepins before a terrific left and right between wind and water; a big  Bavarian hero brandishing a beer-bottle collapsed with a sudden and  acute attack of knee-in-the-stomach; and a strong and handy chair  coming to Dick's hand in the nick of time and used as a flail, and with  strict impartiality, soon did the rest. Berserk with fight, and with  the plucky little Jew to help him, Dick cleared the bar till not a soul  but the frightened bar-keeper and themselves stood within the locked  doors. Outside they could hear the crowd yelling for the police.    \"Mein Gott, mein lieber Gott! Who will pay for all der smashes?\"  whimpered the bar-keeper, wringing his hands, and looking round at the  trail of the cyclone.    \"Tell the truth abaht that big fat 'ed starting the row to the police,  and I'll pay for the smash,\" said the little Jew. \"And while we're  waiting for the police let's have a drink,\" he continued. \"Here's your  health, guv'nor; blimey, but you're a bit useful in a scrap!\" By this  time the police were pounding at the door. \"My money my money!\" again  pleaded the bar-keeper.    \"Right-oh!\" said the Jew, putting his hand in his pocket. His face  changed; quickly and anxiously he searched for his pocket-book it was  gone! Whilst they had had him on the floor they had improved the  occasion; and his blank stare of dismay was mirrored on Dick's face as  the latter remembered that he too was penniless and owed for a drink!    \"Schwein-hunden! Thieves! Robbers! Dam-fools!\" yelled the exasperated  bar-keeper, unlocking the door for the police. That night they slept in  a German prison.        CHAPTER II         Sydney could not disguise from himself the fact that the situation was  rather serious. The escapade would probably mean a sentence of a stiff  bout of imprisonment, or a heavy fine, and, as he was penniless, it  would perforce have to be the former.    \"Hang that little Yiddisher!\" he growled, as he sucked at his empty  pipe; \"wish I'd let him get out of his trouble himself. No! I couldn't  have done that. He's a plucky little beggar, and I suppose he's as bad  off as myself now his pocket-book's gone. Still, I suppose something'll  turn up.\"    His optimism was justified, for about ten o'clock the following morning  he was liberated without more ado, and outside the gaol he found the  little Hebrew who had been the cause of all the trouble.    \"I squared 'em,\" explained the little man, with a grin; \"sent a note  along to a pal of mine who knows the ropes, and he soon got us out.  Better come along and have some grub!\"    \"Look here,\" said Dick, \"I'd better let you know right away that I'm  dead-broke.\"    \"Never mind,\" said the other; \"come along and feed, and then we'll  yap.\"    A good meal, and a good smoke after it, and the little Jew said  abruptly, \"Now then, Mr. Sydney, I've found out a bit about you this  morning, and if you want a job,"]]]
