A few paces farther is the Theatre of the  _Porte St-Martin_, which was never a fashionable resort, but has often  produced me much entertainment, particularly when the celebrated  Mademoiselle George afforded it the benefits of her talents; proceeding  a few hundred yards distance, the Theatre of the _Ambigu-Comique_  presents itself as worthy of remark; although of a minor rank, I  remember being much amused at the long trains of persons waiting,  according to the custom in France, at the doors of this Theatre for  admission when a popular piece was played, called Nostradamus; as two  persons can only pay at once no more are suffered to enter at a time;  hence they form in pairs behind each other until they extend sometimes,  the length of a furlong; they remain very quiet occasionally for hours,  the first comers standing close to the doors, and as others arrive they  regularly take their station behind the last persons of the _queue_, as  it is styled. I remember an Englishman coming up when the tail had  attained rather an inconvenient length, and he did not relish placing  himself at the end of it, and endeavoured to slip into one of the joints  as it was much nearer the door; but a _gendarme_, perceiving his drift,  very unceremoniously marched him to the end of the queue, as precedence  is allotted to persons in proportion as they arrive earlier or later and  the most perfect order is by that means preserved; how much better is  such an arrangement than that which prevails in England at the entering  of the theatres, where physical strength alone gives priority, and the  bigger the brute the sooner he enters, whilst screams and murmurs attest  the treading upon toes, squeezing of ribs, etc.    The fountain of _St-Martin_ in front of the _Ambigu-Comique_ is one of  the most beautiful objects in Paris; a handsome font rises in the middle  from which the water falls in sheets of silvery profusion, whilst  around, lions disgorge liquid streams which all unite in the _grand  basin_; this sight is most beautiful to behold by the light of the moon.  We next enter the _Boulevard du Temple_, where there is such a number of  theatres and coffee-houses all joining each other, that there is really  some difficulty of ascertaining which is the one or the other. The  Theatre _de la Gaiete_, the resort principally of the middle or lower  classes, is one of the most conspicuous, as also the _Cirque Olympique_,  or Franconi's Theatre, where the performances resemble those at  Astley's. There is always an immense crowd on these _Boulevards_ amusing  themselves around a number of shows; or playing or looking at various  games which are constantly going forward, singers, musicians, conjurors,  merry andrews, fortune tellers, orators, dancers, tumblers, etc., are  all exerting their powers, to gain a little coin from the easily pleased  multitude; these _boulevards_ have in fact the appearance of a perpetual  _fete_ or fair, but the curious ideas that appear to me to have entered  the heads of these people in the nature of their performances, are such  as I should imagine none would ever have thought of but the French; nor  any lower orders but of that nation could have been found to appreciate  such singular exhibitions. One of this description particularly excited  my notice; a man came up with another man in his arms and popped him  down just as if he was a block; he had no sooner deposited his burden  than he began a long harangue upon the talents of the individual whom he  had just deposited before us, in acting a machine or automaton, he then  to prove his assertion gave him a knock on the back of the head, when it  fell forward just as if it had belonged to a figure made with joints; he  then gave it a chuck of the chin so violent that it sent the head back  so as to lean on the coat collar; at last he put it in its proper  position, he then operated upon the arms and legs of the image actor in  the same manner, and so perfectly lifeless did he appear, that many new  comers who had not heard the introductory speech of the showman,  absolutely thought that it was on inanimate figure made to imitate a man  that was before them, as the orator always designated his piece of still  life his _mecanique_, which means _machine_; in order to afford every  one the benefit of a close examination, he lifted up his automaton, then  flumped him directly opposite and close to the persons who formed part  of the circle and whom he judged were most likely to throw a sou,  bidding us observe that even the eye never winked and that there was not  the slightest breathing perceptible, and in justice I must say I never  saw an actor better play his part, for watch him as closely as you would  there never was the least symptom of life visible. I had often before  seen images made to imitate men, but never had till then seen a man  imitate an image: a few paces farther was a man acting a variety of  parts with extraordinary humour, an old nurse out of place, then a young  lover entreating his mistress to have pity on him, next a man in a  violent passion, presently, an epicure eating _bonbons_ on the verge of  the grave; the inexhaustible force of lungs, the incessant supply of  words and ideas that many of them appeared to possess, to me was quite a  matter of wonderment. At a short distance is a fort with cannon, whilst  persons take a cross-bow and shoot at it; if they can hit one of the  guns it naturally goes off; for the privilege of having a shot, a sou is  paid if he do not hit the cannon, but if he succeed in so doing, he  receives a sou; the reader may suppose that a miss takes place at the  rate of about seven times to a hit; and after several young countrymen  had been trying in vain, and had lost a good many pence, they began to  grumble and declare that it was next to impossible to hit the cannon  more than once in a hundred times, upon which the proprietor himself  took the cross-bow and at the same distance as the others stood, hit the  cannon five times running with the most perfect apparent ease, which  certainly silenced the grumblers, but convinced them of their own  awkwardness. My attention was next attracted by a pretty little building  surrounded by moss and trees, at the top of a large glass globe which  contained water with several gold and silver fish swimming in it, while  some canary birds, who were sometimes perching on the house, the moss,  or the trees, ever and anon flew to the bottom of the globe and were  seen fluttering about amongst the fish, then ascend to their little  building without having wetted a feather; the effect is very pretty and  the deception is pleasing, inasmuch as the birds require no torturing  tuition to perform their little parts; the secret consists in one globe  being placed in another considerably larger, the outer being filled with  water in which are the fish, whilst the inner wherein the birds are seen  is dry and empty. A fortress where canary birds are again the performers  is a sight which is extremely curious, as a proof of what these little  creatures are capable of executing under the management of a master,  where I fear gentleness has not only been exercised; a number of little  cannon are placed to which the birds apply a substance at the end of a  little stick which causes them to go off, when some fall and pretend to  die and the victors advance with their muskets, and strutting about give  you to understand that the fort is taken and that they are conquerors.    To recapitulate all the curious manoeuvres which are constantly going  forward on the _Boulevards_ would swell a volume, we will therefore pass  on to the more retired parts, where the fine vistas of high trees have  been spared the havoc of the Three Days; these once extended throughout  the whole course of the _Boulevards_, but so many trees were cut down to  form barricades, that those beautiful arches formed by rows of lofty  elms, which were merely trained on the inner side, the outer being  suffered to grow in the wild luxuriance of nature, are only now to be  met with \"few and far between.\" Near the spot where formerly stood the  much dreaded Bastille, now rises to the view the column erected to  commemorate the Revolution of 1830; inclining to the right, the  _Boulevards_ then lead to the Seine. In many parts of these delightful  promenades, double rows of chairs are placed, and persons of the highest  respectability come from different quarters and sit for hours in them,  amused with observing the happy moving scene around them; the seats on  the _Boulevard Italien_ are often occupied by persons of fashion, who  arrive in their equipages, then take chairs for an hour or two, whilst  their carriages wait for them; the charge for each chair is one sou,  but every one takes two, one for the purpose of resting the feet, and  generally takes ices which are served from Tortoni's, long celebrated  for the supply of that cooling refreshment. It is by night that the  _Boulevards_ are seen to the greatest advantage, the innumerable lights  blazing from the different theatres, the lamps placed before the  coffee-houses, the brilliant shops, the trees, the equipages, the sound  of music and singing, the houses, which resemble palaces, the gilded  cafes all united has the air of a fairy scene to any one brought  suddenly upon them.    Some of the handsomest shops and coffee-houses are to be found on the  _Boulevards_, and dwellings where many of the most respectable persons  reside. There is always an humble traffic going on from an immense  number of stalls, in which various commodities are sold, and although  the assortment consists of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#18)"],[1," stability it would give to his theory, and what certainty to his future  procedure!    But he must wait for this, as he must wait for Angeline's story from  Madame Duclos. Meantime, a word with Sweetwater--after which, rest.    It was Mr. Gryce's custom, especially when engaged upon a case of marked  importance, to receive this, his recognized factotum, in his own home. No  prying ears, no watchful eyes, were to be feared there. He was the  absolute master of everything, even of Sweetwater, he sometimes thought.  For this young fellow loved him--had reason to; and when Sweetwater  played the violin, as he sometimes did after one of their long talks, the  aged detective came as near happiness as he ever did, now that his little  grandchild was married and had gone with her husband to the other side of  the world.    To-night he was not anticipating any such relaxation as this, yet to  Sweetwater, arriving later than he wished, he had never looked more in  need of it, as, sitting in his old and somewhat dingy library, he mused  over some little object he held in his half-closed palm, with an intent,  care-worn gaze which it distressed his young subordinate to see.  Uncertainty incites the young and fires them to action; but it wearies  the old and saps what little strength they have; and Sweetwater detected  uncertainty in his patron's troubled brow and prolonged stare at the  insignificant article absorbing his attention.    However, Gryce roused quickly at the young detective's cheery greeting,  and looking up with an answering welcome, plunged at once into business.    \"So you have seen Turnbull! What did the man say?\"    \"That it was the left-hand upper corner of the tapestry he saw shaking,  and not the right-hand one as we had blindly supposed.\"    \"Good! Then we can take it for granted that our new theory is well  founded. Certain things have come to light in your absence. That tapestry  was pulled aside not merely for the purpose of flinging in the bow, but  to let the flinger pass through the door at its back down to the  Curator's office and so out into the court.\"    \"Whew! And who....\"    \"If this fact had been made known to me sooner, you would have had a  different day's work; not getting it until late this afternoon, we have  perhaps wasted some valuable hours. But we won't fret about that. Mrs.  Taylor being no better, we are likely to have all the time we want for  substantiating my idea. It cannot take long if we succeed either in  tracing the Duclos woman or in drawing the net I am quietly  manufacturing, so closely about--well, I've decided to call him X--that  it will hold against all opposition. I have hopes of finding the woman,  but great doubts as to the efficacy of the net I have mentioned; it will  have to be so wide and deep, and so absolutely without a single weak  strand.\"    Sweetwater sat astonished, and what was more, silent--he who had a word  for everything. Accustomed as he was to the varying moods of his  remarkable friend, he had never before been met with a reticence so  absolute. It made him think; but for once in his life did not make him  loquacious.    Mr. Gryce seemed to be gratified by this, though he made no remark to  that effect and continued to preserve his abstracted look and quiet  demeanor. So Sweetwater waited, and while waiting managed to steal a  glimpse at the small object to which his professional friend still paid  his undivided attention.    It looked like a narrow bit of dingy black cloth--just that and nothing  more--a thing as trivial as the band which clips a closed umbrella. Was  it such a band, and would he presently be asked to find the umbrella from  which it had fallen or been twisted away? No. Umbrellas are not carried  about museum buildings. Besides, this strip of cloth had no ring on the  end of it. Consequently it could not have served the purpose he had just  ascribed to it. It must have had some other use.    But when, after an impatient flinging aside of this nondescript article,  Mr. Gryce spoke, it was to say:    \"I had a long talk with Correy to-day. It seems that he goes through both  galleries every morning before the museum opens. Though he will not swear  to it, he is of the opinion that the quiver holding the Apache arrows had  its full complement when he passed it that morning. He has a way of  running things over with his eye which has never yet failed to draw his  attention to anything defective or in the least out of order.\"    \"I see, sir,\" acquiesced Sweetwater in an odd tone, Mr. Gryce's attitude  showing that he awaited some expression of interest on his part.    The elder detective either did not notice the curious note in the younger  one's voice, or noticing it, chose to ignore it, for with no change of  manner he proceeded to say:    \"I wish you would exercise your wits, Sweetwater, on the following  troublesome question: if the arrow which slew this young girl was in one  gallery at ten o'clock, how did it get into the other at twelve? The  bow\"--here he purposely hesitated--\"might have been brought up the iron  staircase. But the arrow----\"    His eyes were on Sweetwater (a direct glance was a rare thing with Mr.  Gryce), and he waited--waited patiently for the word which did not come;  then he remarked dryly:    \"We are both dull; you are tired with your day's work and I with mine:  we will let difficult questions rest until our brains are clearer.  But\"--here he reached for the strip of dingy cloth he had cast aside, and  tossing it over to Sweetwater, added with some suggestion of humor,--\"if  you want a subject to dream upon to-night, there it is. If you have no  desire to dream, and want work for to-morrow, make an effort to discover  from whose clothing that fell and what was its use. It was picked up in  Room B on the second floor, the one where Mrs. Taylor was detained before  going downstairs.\"    \"Ah, something tangible at last!\"    \"I don't know about that; I honestly don't know. But we cannot afford to  let anything go by us. Little things like that have not infrequently  opened up a fresh trail which otherwise might have been missed.\"    Sweetwater nodded, and laying the little strip along his palm, examined  it closely. It was made of silk, doubled, and stitched together except at  the ends. These were loose, but rough with bits of severed thread, as if  the thing had been hastily cut from some article of clothing to which it  had been attached by some half-dozen very clumsy stitches.    \"I think I understand you, Mr. Gryce,\" observed Sweetwater, rising slowly  to his feet. \"But a dream may help me out; we will see.\"    \"I shall not leave here till ten to-morrow morning.\"    \"Very good, sir. If you don't mind, I'll take this with me.\"    \"Take it, by all means.\"    As Sweetwater turned to go, he was induced by the silence of his patron  to cast a backward glance. Mr. Gryce had risen to his feet and was  leaning toward him with an evident desire to speak.    \"My boy,\" said he, \"if your dreams lead you to undertake the search I  have mentioned, spare nobody; I say, spare _nobody_.\"    Then he sat down; and the memory which Sweetwater carried away with him  of the old detective at the moment he uttered this final injunction was  far from being a cheerful one.          XIII    \"WRITE ME HIS NAME\"      Refreshed by a good night's rest and quite ready to take up his task  again, Mr. Gryce sat at the same table in the early morning, awaiting the  expected message from Sweetwater. Meanwhile he studied, with a fuller  attention than he had been able to give it the evening before, the  memorandum which this young fellow had handed him of his day's work. A  portion of this may be interesting to the reader. Against the list of  people registered on his chart as present in the museum at the moment of  tragedy, he had inscribed such details concerning them as he could gather  in the short time allotted him.           *       *       *       *       *    I--Ephraim Short. A sturdy New Englander visiting New York for the first  time. Has a big story to take back. Don't care much for broken marbles  and pictures so dingy you cannot tell what you are looking at; but the  sight of a lot of folks standing up like scarecrows in a field, here and  there all over a great building, because something had happened to  somebody, will make a story the children will listen to for years.    Address taken, and account of himself verified by telegraph.    II--Mrs. Lynch. Widow, with a small house in Jersey and money to support  it. No children. Interested in church work. Honest and of reliable  character. Only fault a physical one--extreme nervousness.

A universally respected man of  unquestioned integrity and decided importance. Close friend of Curator  Jewett.    IV--Eben Clarke, door-man. Been long in the employ of museum. Considered  entirely trustworthy. Home in decent quarter of West 80th Street. Wife  and nine children, mostly grown. Never been abroad. Has no foreign  correspondence.    V--Emma Sutton, an art enthusiast, gaining her living by copying old  masters. Is at museum six days in the week. It was behind her easel  Travis found a hiding-place in Room H.    VI--Mrs. Alice Lee, widowed sister of Edward Cronk Tailor, ---- Sixth  Ave. Lives with brother. Kindly in disposition, much liked and truthful  to a fault. No acquaintance abroad.
