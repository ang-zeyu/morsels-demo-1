The rosin may be added to the soap-pan after a previous partial  saponification with soda ash, and removal of colouring matter, and  finally saponified with caustic soda lye, or, as is more generally  adopted, as a rosin change. The pan is opened with caustic soda lye and  saturation of the rosin takes place rapidly; when completely saponified  it is grained with salt, and the coloured lye allowed to deposit and  finally withdrawn.    The four operations already detailed apply to this soap.    Cheaper pale soaps may be made from lower grades of tallow and rosin and  are generally silicated.    (_b_) _Tablet or Washer Type._--A demand has arisen for soap of free  lathering qualities, which has become very popular for general household  use. This soap is usually made from a mixture of cotton-seed oil,  tallow, and cocoa-nut oil, with a varying amount of rosin. The tallow  yields firmness and durability whilst the other constituents all assist  in the more ready production of a copious lather.    As to what amount of rosin can be used to yield a finished soap of  sufficient body and satisfactory colour, this naturally depends upon the  grade of raw material at the soap-makers' disposal. Those fats and oils  which yield firm soaps, will, of course, allow a greater proportion of  rosin to be incorporated with them than materials producing soaps of  less body. Rosin imparts softness to a soap, and also colour.    This is a fitted soap and full details of manufacture have already been  given.    Cheaper soaps are produced from lower grade materials hardened with  alkaline solutions.    _Resting of Pans and Settling of Soap._--The fitted soap is allowed to  settle from four to six days. The period allowed for resting is  influenced, however, not only by the size of the boil, and the season,  but also by the composition of the soap, for if the base has been made  from firm stock it is liable to cool quicker than a soap produced from  soft-bodied materials.    On subsidence, the contents of the pan will have divided into the  following:--    First. On top, a thin crust of soap, with perhaps a little light  coloured fob, which is returned to the pan after the removal of the good  soap.    Second. The good settled soap, testing 62-63 per cent. fatty acids. The  subject of removing and treatment of this layer is fully dealt with in  the next chapter.    Third. A layer of darker weak soap, termed \"nigre,\" which on an average  tests 33 per cent. fatty acids, and, according to the particular fit  employed, will amount to from 15-20 per cent. of the total quantity of  soap in the pan.    The quantity of nigre may vary not only with the amount of water added  during finishing, but is also influenced by the amount of caustic alkali  remaining in the soap paste prior to fitting. If the free caustic  alkali-content is high, the soap will require a large amount of water to  attain the desired fit. This water renders the caustic into a lye  sufficiently weak to dissolve a quantity of soap, consequently, as the  \"nigre\" is a weak solution of soap together with any excess of alkali  (caustic or carbonate) and salt which gravitates during the settling,  the quantity is increased.    Fourth. A solution containing alkaline salts, mostly carbonates and  chlorides, with a little caustic.    The amount of the layer is very variable, and doubtless, under certain  physical conditions, this liquor has separated from the nigre.    _Utilisation of Nigres._--The nigres are boiled and the liquor separated  by graining with salt. Nigre may be utilised in various ways.    (1) It may be used several times with new materials. This particularly  refers to soaps of the \"Washer\" type. The colour of the nigre will  determine the number of times it can be employed.    (2) It may be incorporated with a soap of a lower grade than the one  from which it was obtained. In this case a system is generally adopted;  for example, soap of the best quality is made in a clean pan, the nigre  remaining is worked up with fresh material for soap of the next quality,  the nigre from that boil, in its turn, is admixed with a charge to  produce a batch of third quality, and the deposited nigre from this is  again used for a fourth quality soap--the nigre obtained from this  latter boil would probably be transferred into the cheapened \"washer\" or  perhaps if it was dark in colour into the brown soap-pan.    (3) The nigre may be fitted and produce a soap similar to the original  soap from which it was deposited. It is advisable to saponify a little  fat with it.    (4) Nigres from several boils of the same kind of soap can be collected,  boiled, and fitted. The settled portion may be incorporated with a new  charging to keep the resultant soap uniform in colour--unless this is  done, the difference in colour between boils from new materials alone,  and those containing nigre, is very noticeable. The nigre settled from  this fitted nigre boil would be utilised in brown soap.    (5) According to its colour, and consistence, a nigre may be suitable  for the production of disinfectant, or cold-water soaps.    (6) Nigre may be bleached by treatment with a 20 per cent. solution of  stannous chloride--1 cwt. of this solution (previously heated) is  sufficient to bleach 20 tons of nigre.    _Transparent Soaps._--The production of transparent soaps has recently  been fully studied, from a theoretical point of view, by Richardson  (_J. Amer. Chem. Soc._, 1908, pp. 414-20), who concludes that the  function of substances inducing transparency, is to produce a jelly and  retard crystallisation.    The old-fashioned transparent soap is prepared by dissolving, previously  dried, genuine yellow soap in alcohol, and allowing the insoluble saline  impurities to be deposited and removed. The alcoholic soap solution is  then placed in a distillation apparatus, or the pan containing the  solution is attached by means of a still head to a condenser, and the  alcohol distilled, condensed and regained. The remaining liquid soap,  which may be coloured and perfumed, is run into frames and allowed to  solidify.    The resultant mass is somewhat turbid, but after storage in a room at  95 deg. F. (35 deg. C.) for several months, becomes transparent.    The formation of the transparency is sometimes assisted and hastened by  the addition of glycerine or a solution of cane-sugar.    A patent has been granted to A. Ruch (Fr. Pat. 327,293, 1902) for the  manufacture of transparent glycerine soap by heating in a closed vessel  fatty acids together with the requisite quantity of alcoholic caustic  soda solution necessary for saponification, and cooling the resultant  soap. It is also proposed to add sugar solution.    Cheaper qualities of transparent soaps are made by the cold process with  or without the aid of alcohol and castor oil, and with the assistance of  glycerine or cane-sugar.    With the continual demand for cheaper production, sugar solution has  gradually, in conjunction with castor oil, which produces transparency,  superseded the use of alcohol and glycerine.    For a small batch, 56 lb. Cochin cocoa-nut oil and 56 lb. sweet edible  tallow may be taken, melted at 130 deg. F. (54 deg. C.), and carefully strained  into a small steam-jacketed pan. It is imperative that the materials  should be of the highest quality and perfectly clean. Twenty-three lb.  of pure glycerine and 56 lb. of bright caustic soda solution made from  high grade caustic and having a density of 72 deg. Tw. (38 deg. B.) are crutched  into the fat; the alcohol, which would be 45 lb. in this example, is  then added. The whole must be most intimately incorporated, and the pan  covered and allowed to rest for one hour or one and a half hours.  Saponification should ensue.    To produce a transparent glycerine soap with the aid of castor oil, and  with or without the use of alcohol, the following is the procedure:--    Cochin cocoa-nut oil, sweet edible tallow, and castor oil, of each 56  lb. are taken, warmed to 130 deg. F. (54 deg. C.), and carefully strained into  the jacketed pan. If it is desired to use glycerine and cane sugar  solution, and no alcohol, the glycerine (25 lb.) is now stirred into the  fats together with the requisite (83 lb.) caustic soda solution 72 deg. Tw.  (38 deg. B.). If it is intended to use alcohol and sugar, and no glycerine,  the latter is replaced by 47 lb. of alcohol, and added after the  incorporation of the caustic soda lye.    The whole being thoroughly crutched, the pan is covered and  saponification allowed to proceed for one hour or one and a half hours.  Should the saponification for some reason be retarded, a little steam  may be very cautiously admitted to the jacket of the pan, the mass well  crutched until the reaction commences, and the whole allowed to rest the  specified time.    Whilst saponification is proceeding, the \"sugar solution\" is prepared by  dissolving 50 lb. cane sugar in 50 lb. water, at 168 deg. F. (76 deg. C.), to  which may be added 5 lb. soda crystals, and any necessary colouring  matter. The water used for this solution should be as soft as possible,  as hard water is liable to produce opaque streaks of lime soap.    It is absolutely necessary before proceeding further to ensure that  saponification is complete. A greasy, soft feel and the presence of  \"strength\" (caustic) would denote incomplete saponification--this can  only be remedied by further heating and crutching."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#18)"],[1,"ine\" to the Red-men, when  they saw it kill at a distance which the few wretched guns they had  obtained from the fur-traders could not even send a spent ball to.  The  double shot, too, filled them with wonder and admiration; but that which  they regarded with an almost supernatural feeling of curiosity was the  percussion cap, which in Dick's hands always exploded, but in theirs was  utterly useless!    This result was simply owing to the fact, that Dick after firing handed  the rifle to the Indians without renewing the cap.  So that when they  loaded and attempted to fire, of course it merely snapped.  When he  wished again to fire, he adroitly exchanged the old cap for a new one.  He was immensely tickled by the solemn looks of the Indians at this most  incomprehensible of all \"medicines,\" and kept them for some days in  ignorance of the true cause, intending to reveal it before he left.  But  circumstances now arose which banished all trifling thoughts from his  mind.    Mahtawa raised his head suddenly, and said, pointing to the silver  rifle, \"Mahtawa wishes to have the two-shotted medicine gun.  He will  give his best horse in exchange.\"    \"Mahtawa is liberal,\" answered Joe, \"but the pale-faced youth cannot  part with it.  He has far to travel, and must shoot buffaloes by the  way.\"    \"The pale-faced youth shall have a bow and arrows to shoot the buffalo,\"  rejoined the Indian.    \"He cannot use the bow and arrow,\" answered Joe; \"he has not been  trained like the Red-man.\"    Mahtawa was silent for a few seconds, and his dark brows frowned more  heavily than ever over his eyes.    \"The Pale-faces are too bold,\" he exclaimed, working himself into a  passion; \"they are in the power of Mahtawa.  If they will not give the  gun he will take it.\"    He sprang suddenly to his feet as he spoke, and snatched the rifle from  Henri's hand.    Henri, being ignorant of the language, had not been able to understand  the foregoing conversation, although he saw well enough that it was not  an agreeable one but no sooner did he find himself thus rudely and  unexpectedly deprived of the rifle, than he jumped up, wrenched it in a  twinkling from the Indian's grasp, and hurled him violently out of the  tent.    In a moment Mahtawa drew his knife, uttered a savage yell, and sprang on  the reckless hunter, who, however, caught his wrist, and held it as if  in a vice.  The yell brought a dozen warriors instantly to the spot, and  before Dick had time to recover from his astonishment, Henri was  surrounded and pinioned despite his herculean struggles.    Before Dick could move, Joe Blunt grasped his arm, and whispered  quickly, \"Don't rise!  You can't help him!  They daren't kill him till  San-it-sa-rish agrees.\"    Though much surprised, Dick obeyed, but it required all his efforts,  both of voice and hand, to control Crusoe, whose mind was much too  honest and straightforward to understand such subtle pieces of  diplomacy, and who strove to rush to the rescue of his ill-used friend.    When the tumult had partly subsided, Joe Blunt rose and said--\"Have the  Pawnee braves turned traitors that they draw the knife against those who  have smoked with them the pipe of peace and eaten their maize?  The  Pale-faces are three; the Pawnees are thousands.  If evil has been done,  let it be laid before the chief.  Mahtawa wishes to have the medicine  gun.  Although we said No, we could not part with it, he tried to take  it by force.  Are we to go back to the great chief of the Pale-faces,  and say that the Pawnees are thieves?  Are the Pale-faces henceforth to  tell their children when they steal, `That is bad; that is like the  Pawnee?'  No! this must not be.  The rifle shall be restored, and we  will forget this disagreement.  Is it not so?\"    There was an evident disposition on the part of many of the Indians,  with whom Mahtawa was no favourite, to applaud this speech; but the wily  chief sprang forward, and, with flashing eye, sought to turn the tables.    \"The Pale-face speaks with soft words, but his heart is false.  Is he  not going to make peace with the enemies of the Pawnee?  Is he not going  to take goods to them, and make them gifts and promises?  The Pale-faces  are spies.  They come to see the weakness of the Pawnee camp, but they  have found that it is strong.  Shall we suffer the false-hearts to  escape?  Shall they live?  No! we will hang their scalps in our wigwams,  for they have _struck a chief_ and we will keep all their goods for our  squaws--wah!\"    This allusion to keeping all the goods had more effect on the minds of  the vacillating savages than the chiefs eloquence.  But a new turn was  given to their thoughts by Joe Blunt remarking in a quiet, almost  contemptuous tone--    \"Mahtawa is not the _great_ chief.\"    \"True, true,\" they cried, and immediately hurried to the tent of  San-it-sa-rish.    Once again this chief stood between the hunters and the savages, who  wanted but a signal to fall on them.  There was a long palaver, which  ended in Henri being set at liberty, and the rifle being restored.    That evening, as the three friends sat beside their fire eating their  supper of boiled maize and buffalo meat, they laughed and talked as  carelessly as ever; but the gaiety was assumed, for they were at the  time planning their escape from a tribe which, they foresaw, would not  long refrain from carrying out their wishes, and robbing, perhaps  murdering them.    \"Ye see,\" said Joe with a perplexed air, while he drew a piece of live  charcoal from the fire with his fingers and lighted his pipe,--\"ye see,  there's more difficulties in the way o' gettin' off than ye think--\"    \"Oh! nivare mind de difficulties,\" interrupted Henri, whose wrath at the  treatment he had received had not yet cooled down.  \"Ve must jump on de  best horses ve can git hold, shake our fist at de red reptiles, and go  away fast as ve can.  De best hoss _must_ vin de race.\"    Joe shook his head.  \"A hundred arrows would be in our backs before we  got twenty yards from the camp.  Besides, we can't tell which are the  best horses.  Our own are the best in my 'pinion, but how are we to git  'em?\"    \"I know who has charge o' them,\" said Dick; \"I saw them grazing near the  tent o' that poor squaw whose baby was saved by Crusoe.  Either her  husband looks after them or some neighbours.\"    \"That's well,\" said Joe.  \"That's one o' my difficulties gone.\"    \"What are the others?\"    \"Well, d'ye see, they're troublesome.  We can't git the horses out o'  camp without bein' seen, for the red rascals would see what we were at  in a jiffy.  Then, if we do git 'em out, we can't go off without our  bales, an' we needn't think to take 'em from under the nose o' the chief  and his squaws without bein' axed questions.  To go off without them  would niver do at all.\"    \"Joe,\" said Dick, earnestly, \"I've hit on a plan.\"    \"Have ye, Dick? what is't?\"    \"Come and I'll let ye see,\" answered Dick, rising hastily and quitting  the tent, followed by his comrades and his faithful dog.    It may be as well to remark here, that no restraint whatever had yet  been put on the movements of our hunters as long as they kept to their  legs, for it was well-known that any attempt by men on foot to escape  from mounted Indians on the plains would be hopeless.  Moreover, the  savages thought that as long as there was a prospect of their being  allowed to depart peaceably with their goods, they would not be so mad  as to fly from the camp, and, by so doing, risk their lives and declare  war with their entertainers.  They had, therefore, been permitted to  wander unchecked, as yet, far beyond the outskirts of the camp, and  amuse themselves in paddling about the lake in the small Indian canoes  and shooting wild-fowl.    Dick now led the way through the labyrinths of tents in the direction of  the lake, and they talked and laughed loudly, and whistled to Crusoe as  they went, in order to prevent their purpose being suspected.  For the  purpose of further disarming suspicion they went without their rifles.  Dick explained his plan by the way, and it was at once warmly approved  of by his comrades.    On reaching the lake they launched a small canoe, into which Crusoe was  ordered to jump; then, embarking, they paddled swiftly to the opposite  shore, singing a canoe song as they dipped their paddles in the moonlit  waters of the lake.  Arrived at the other side, they hauled the canoe up  and hurried through the thin belt of wood and willows that intervened  between the lake and the prairie.  Here they paused.    \"Is that the bluff, Joe?\"    \"No, Dick, that's too near.  T'other one'll be best.  Far away to the  right.  It's a little one, and there's others near it.  The sharp eyes  o' the Red-skins won't be so likely to be prowlin' there.\"    \"Come on, then; but we'll have to take down by the lake first.\"    In a few minutes the hunters were threading their way through the  outskirts of the wood at a rapid trot, in the opposite direction from  the bluff, or wooded knoll, which they wished to reach.  This they did  lest prying eyes should have followed them.  In a quarter of an hour  they turned at right angles to their track, and struck straight out into  the prairie, and after a long run they edged round and came in upon the  bluff from behind.  It was merely a collection of stunted but  thick-growing willows.    Forcing their way into the centre of this they began to examine it.    \"It'll do,\" said Joe.    \"De very ting,\" remarked Henri.    \"Come here, Crusoe.\"    Crusoe bounded to his master's side, and looked up in his face.    \"Look at this place, pup; smell it well.\"    Crusoe instantly set off all round among the willows, in and out,  snuffing everywhere, and whining with excitement.    \"Come here, good pup; that will do.  Now, lads, we'll go back.\"  So  saying, Dick and his friends left the bluff and retraced their steps to  the camp.  Before they had gone"]]]
