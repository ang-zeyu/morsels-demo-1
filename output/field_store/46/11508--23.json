If we can stay out until we really know what is the  matter we'll have some chance of talking over the high brass at Luna when  we do planet--\"    In the end they decided not to interfere with the course the Captain had  set. It would take them into the fringes of solar civilization, but give  them a fighting chance at solving their problem before they had to report  to the authorities. In the meantime they tended their charges, let Rip  sleep, and watched each other with desperate but hidden intentness, ready  for another to be stricken. However, they remained, although almost  stupid with fatigue at times, reasonably healthy. Time was proving that  their guess had been correct--they had been somehow inoculated against  the germ or virus which had struck the ship.    Rip slept for twenty-four hours, ship time, and then came into the mess  cabin ravenously hungry, to catch up on both food and news. And he  refused to join with the prevailing pessimistic view of the future.  Instead he was sure that their own immunity having been proven, they had  a talking point to use with the medical officials at Luna and he was  eager to alter course directly for the quarantine station. Only the  combined arguments of the other three made him, unwillingly, agree to a  short delay.    And how grateful they should be for Captain Jellico's foresight they  learned within the next day. Ali was at the com-unit, trying to pick up  Solarian news reports. When the red alert flashed on throughout the ship  it brought the others hurrying to the control cabin. The code squeaks  were magnified as Ali switched on the receiver full strength, to be  translated as he pressed a second button.    \"Repeat, repeat, repeat. Free Trader, Solar Queen, Terra Registry  65-724910-Jk, suspected plague ship--took off from infected planet. Warn  off--warn off--report such ship to Luna Station. Solar Queen from  infected planet--to be warned off and reported.\" The same message was  repeated three times before going off ether.    The four in the control cabin looked at each other blankly.    \"But,\" Dane broke the silence, \"how did they know? We haven't reported  in--\"    \"The Eysies!\" Ali had the answer ready. \"That I-S ship must be having the  same sort of trouble and reported to her Company. They would include us  in their report and believe that we were infected too--or it would be  easy to convince the authorities that we were.\"    \"I wonder,\" Rip's eyes were narrowed slits as he leaned back against the  wall. \"Look at the facts. The Survey ship which charted Sargol--they were  dirt-side there about three-four months. Yet they gave it a clean bill of  health and put it up for trading rights auction. Then Cam bought those  rights--he made at least two trips in and out before he was blasted on  Limbo. No infection bothered him or Survey--\"    \"But you've got to admit it hit us,\" Weeks protested.    \"Yes, and the Eysie ship was able to foresee it--report us before we  snapped out of Hyper. Sounds almost as if they expected us to carry  plague, doesn't it?\" Shannon wanted to know.    \"Planted?\" Ali frowned at the banks of controls. \"But how--no Eysie came  on board--no Salarik either, except for the cub who showed us what they  thought of catnip.\"    Rip shrugged. \"How would I know how they did--\" he was beginning when  Dane cut in:    \"If they didn't know about our immunity the Queen might stay in Hyper and  never come out--there wouldn't be anyone to set the snap-out.\"    \"Right enough. But on the chance that somebody did keep on his feet and  bring her home, they were ready with a cover. If no one raises a howl  Sargol will be written off the charts as infected, I-S sits on her tail  fins a year or so and then she promotes an investigation before the  Board. The Survey records are trotted out--no infection recorded. So they  send in a Patrol Probe. Everything is all right--so it wasn't the planet  after all--it was that dirty old Free Trader. And she's out of the way.  I-S gets the Koros trade all square and legal and we're no longer around  to worry about! Neat as a Salariki net-cast--and right around our  collective throats, my friends!\"    \"So what do we do now?\" Weeks wanted to know.    \"We keep on the Old Man's course, get lost in the asteroids until we can  do some heavy thinking and see a way out. But if I-S gave us this prize  package, some trace of its origin is still aboard. And if we can find  that--why, then we have something to start from.\"    \"Mura went down first--and then Karl. Nothing in common,\" the old problem  faced Dane for the hundredth time.    \"No. But,\" Ali arose from his place at the com-unit. \"I'd suggest a real  search of first Frank's and then Karl's quarters. A regular turn out  down to the bare walls of their cabins. Are you with me?\"    \"Fly boy, we're ahead of you!\" Rip contributed, already at the door  panel. \"Down to the bare walls it is.\"          Chapter X    E-STAT LANDING      Since Mura was in the isolation of ship sick bay the stripping of his  cabin was a relatively simple job. But, though Rip and Dane went over it  literally by inches, they found nothing unusual--in fact nothing from  Sargol except a small twig of the red wood which lay on the steward's  worktable where he had been fashioning something to incorporate in one of  his miniature fairy landscapes, to be imprisoned for all time in a  plasta-bubble. Dane turned this around in his fingers. Because it was the  only link with the perfumed planet he couldn't help but feel that it had  some importance.    But Kosti had not shown any interest in the wood. And he, himself, and  Weeks had handled it freely _before_ they had tasted Graft's friendship  cup and had no ill effects--so it couldn't be the wood. Dane put the twig  back on the work table and snapped the protecting cover over the delicate  tools--never realizing until days later how very close he had been in  that moment to the solution of their problem.    After two hours of shifting every one of the steward's belongings, of  crawling on hands and knees about the deck and climbing to inspect  perfectly bare walls, they had found exactly nothing. Rip sat down on the  end of the denuded bunk.    \"There's the hydro--Frank spent a lot of time in there--and the  storeroom,\" he told the places off on his fingers. \"The galley and the  mess cabin.\"    Those had been the extent of Mura's world. They could search the  storeroom, the galley and the mess cabin--but to interfere with the hydro  would endanger their air supply. It was for that very reason that they  now looked at each other in startled surmise.    \"The perfect place to plant something!\" Dane spoke first.    Rip's teeth caught his underlip. The hydro--something planted there could  not be routed out unless they made a landing on a port field and had the  whole section stripped.    \"Devilish--\" Rip's mobile lips drew tight. \"But how could they do it?\"    Dane didn't see how it could have been done either. No one but the  Queen's own crew had been on board the ship during their entire stay on  Sargol, except for the young Salarik. Could that cub have brought  something? But he and Mura had been with the youngster every minute that  he had been in the hydro. To the best of Dane's memory the cub had  touched nothing and had been there only for a few moments. That had been  before the feast also--    Rip got to his feet. \"We can't strip the hydro in space,\" he pointed out  the obvious quietly.    Dane had the answer. \"Then we've got to earth!\"    \"You heard that warn-off. If we try it--\"    \"What about an Emergency station?\"    Rip stood very still, his big hands locked about the buckle of his arms  belt. Then, without another word, he went out of the cabin and at a  pounding pace up the ladder, bound for the Captain's cabin and the  records Jellico kept there. It was such a slim chance--but it was better  than none at all.    Dane shouldered into the small space in his wake to find Rip making a  selection from the astrogation tapes. There were E-Stats among the  asteroids--points prospectors or small traders in sudden difficulties  might contact for supplies or repairs. The big Companies maintained their  own--the Patrol had several for independents.    \"No Patrol one--\"    Rip managed a smile. \"I haven't gone space whirly yet,\" was his comment.  He was feeding a tape into the reader on the Captain's desk. In the cage  over his head the blue Hoobat squatted watching him intently--for the  first time since Dane could remember showing no sign of resentment by  weird screams or wild spitting.    \"Patrol E-Stat A-54--\" the reader squeaked. Rip hit a key and the wire  clicked to the next entry. \"Combine E-Stat--\" Another punch and click.  \"Patrol E-Stat A-55--\" punch-click. \"Inter-Solar--\" this time Rip's hand  did not hit the key and the squeak continued--\"Co-ordinates--\" Rip  reached for a steelo and jotted down the list of figures.    \"Got to compare this with our present course--\"    \"But that's an I-S Stat,\" began Dane and then he laughed as the justice  of such a move struck him. They did not dare set the Queen down at any  Patrol Station. But a Company one which would be manned by only two or  three men and not expecting any but their own people--and I-S owed them  help now!    \"There may be trouble,\" he said, not that he would have any regrets if  there was. If the Eysies were responsible for the present plight of the  Queen he would welcome trouble, the kind which would plant his fists on  some sneering Eysie face.    \"We'll see about that when we come to it,\" Rip went on to the control  cabin with his figures. Carefully he punched the combination on the  plotter and watched it be compared with the course Jellico had set before  his collapse.    \"Good enough,\" he commented as the result flashed on. \"We can make it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#18)"],[1,"r, and, skirting the seas which lay upon his left, reached  the islands of Rhodes and Cyprus, whence he made a bolder crossing to  Syria.[206] On his way he conceived a desire to visit the temple of  Venus at Paphos,[207] which is famous among all the inhabitants and  visitors. It may not be tedious to give here a short account of the  origin of this worship, the ritual of the cult, and the  shape--unparalleled elsewhere--in which the goddess is depicted.    According to an old tradition the temple was founded by King             3  Aerias, and some people maintain that the goddess bears the same name.  A more modern version states that the temple was consecrated by  Cinyras,[208] on the spot where the goddess landed when the sea gave  her birth. The method of divination,[209] however, according to this  account, was imported from elsewhere by the Cilician Tamiras, and an  arrangement was made that the descendants of both families should  preside over the rites. Later, however, it seemed wrong that the royal  line should have no prerogative, so the descendants of the  foreigner[210] resigned the practice of the art which they had  themselves introduced, and now the priest whom you consult is always  of the line of Cinyras. They accept any victim that is offered, but  males are preferred. They put most faith in kids' entrails. Blood  must not be poured on the altar, at which they offer only prayers and  fire untainted by smoke. Although the altars stand in the open air  they are never wetted by rain. The goddess is not represented in human  form; the idol is a sort of circular pyramid,[211] rising from a broad  base to a small round top, like a turning-post. The reason of this is  unknown.    Titus inspected the temple treasures and the offerings made by           4  various kings, and other curiosities which the Greek passion for  archaeology attributes to a dim antiquity. He then consulted the  oracle first about his voyage. Learning that the sea was calm, and  that no obstacles stood in his way, he sacrificed a large number of  victims, and put covert questions about his own fortunes. The priest,  whose name was Sostratus, seeing that the entrails were uniformly  favourable, and that the goddess assented to Titus' ambitious schemes,  returned at the moment a brief and ordinary reply, but afterwards  sought a private interview and revealed the future to him. So Titus  returned to his father with heightened hopes, and amid the general  anxiety of the provinces and their armies his arrival spread boundless  confidence of success.    Vespasian had already broken the back of the Jewish war.[212] Only the  siege of Jerusalem remained. That this proved a difficult and  laborious task was due rather to the high situation of the town and  the stubborn superstition of its inhabitants than to any adequate  provision enabling them to endure the hardships of the siege.  Vespasian had, as we have already stated,[213] three legions well  tried in war. Four others were under Mucianus' command.[213] Although  these had never seen war, yet their envy of the neighbouring army's  fame had banished sloth. Indeed, as the former were hardened by work  and danger, so the latter owed their ardour to their unbroken  inaction, and their shame at having no share in the war.[214] Both  generals had, besides auxiliary infantry and cavalry, foreign  fleets[215] and allied princes,[216] and a fame that rested on widely  differing claims. Vespasian was an indefatigable campaigner. He          5  headed the column, chose the camping-ground, never ceasing by night or  day to use strategy, and, if need be, the sword to thwart the enemy.  He eat what he could get, and dressed almost like a common soldier.  Indeed, save for his avarice, he matched the generals of old days.  Mucianus, on the other hand, was distinguished by his wealth and  luxury, and his general superiority to the standards of a private  person. He was the better speaker, and a skilful administrator and  statesman. Their combined qualities would have made a fine emperor,  if one could have blended their virtues and omitted their vices.  Governing as they did the neighbouring provinces of Judaea and Syria,  jealousy at first led to quarrels. However, on the death of Nero, they  forgot their dislike and joined hands. It was their friends who first  brought them together, and subsequently Titus became the chief bond of  union and for the common good suppressed their ignoble jealousy. Both  by nature and training he had charm to fascinate even such a man as  Mucianus. The tribunes and centurions and the common soldiers were  attracted, each according to his character, either by Titus'  meritorious industry or by his gay indulgence in pleasure.    Before the arrival of Titus both armies had sworn allegiance to          6  Otho. News travels fast in such cases, but civil war is a slow and  serious undertaking, and the East, after its long repose, was now for  the first time beginning to arm for it. In earlier times all the  fiercest civil wars broke out in Italy or Cisalpine Gaul among the  forces of the West. Pompey, Cassius, Brutus, and Antony all courted  disaster by carrying the war oversea. Syria and Judaea often heard of  Caesars, but seldom saw one. There were no mutinies among the  soldiers. They merely made demonstrations against Parthia with varying  success. Even in the last civil war[217] the peace of these provinces  had been untroubled by the general confusion. Later they were loyal to  Galba. But when they heard that Otho and Vitellius were engaged in a  wicked contest for the possession of the Roman world, the troops  began to chafe at the thought that the prizes of empire should fall to  others, while their own lot was mere compulsory submission. They began  to take stock of their strength. Syria and Judaea had seven legions on  the spot with a vast force of auxiliaries. Next came Egypt with two  legions:[218] beyond lay Cappadocia and Pontus, and all the forts  along the Armenian frontier. Asia and the remaining provinces were  rich and thickly populated. As for the islands, their girdle of sea  was safe from the enemy and aided the prosecution of the war.    The generals were well aware of the soldiers' feelings, but decided      7  to await the issue between Vitellius and Otho. 'In civil war,' they  reckoned, 'there are no sure ties to unite victor and vanquished. It  matters little which survives: even good generals are corrupted by  success: as for Otho and Vitellius, their troops are quarrelsome,  lazy, and luxurious, and they are both the victims of their own vices.  One will fall on the field and the other succumb to his success.' So  Vespasian and Mucianus postponed their attack for the present. They  were themselves recent converts to the project of war, which the  others[219] had long fostered from various motives. The better sort  were animated by patriotism, many by mere love of plunder, some by the  uncertainty of their own fortunes. Thus, though their motives  differed, all, good and bad alike, agreed in their eager desire for  war.    About this time Achaia and Asia were thrown into 8 a groundless panic  by a rumour that 'Nero was at hand'. The accounts of his death being  many and various, people were all the more inclined to allege and to  believe that he was still alive. We shall mention in the course of  this work the attempts and the fate of the other pretenders.[220] This  time it was a slave from Pontus, or, according to other traditions, a  freedman from Italy. His skill as a singer and harpist, combined with  his facial resemblance to Nero, gave him some credentials for  imposture. He bribed some penniless and vagabond deserters by dazzling  promises to join him, and they all set out to sea. A storm drove them  on to the island of Cythnus,[221] where he found some troops homeward  bound on leave from the East. Some of these he enrolled, killing all  who resisted, and then proceeded to plunder the local merchants and  arm all the sturdiest of the slaves. Finding a centurion named Sisenna  carrying home a pair of silver hands[222] as a token of alliance from  the army in Syria to the Household Guards, he tried by various devices  to seduce him, until Sisenna took fright and escaped secretly from the  island in fear of violence. Thus the panic spread. The great name of  Nero attracted many who pined for revolution and hated the existing  state of things. The rumours waxed daily, until a chance dispelled  them. Galba had entrusted the government of Galatia and                  9  Pamphylia[223] to Calpurnius Asprenas, who had been granted an escort  of two triremes from the fleet at Misenum. It so happened that with  these he touched at Cythnus. The rebels lost no time in appealing to  the ship's captains in the name of Nero. The pretender, assuming an  air of melancholy, appealed to 'the loyalty of his former soldiers',  and begged them to establish him in Syria or Egypt. The captains  either from sympathy or guile alleged that they must talk to their  men, and would come back when they had prepared all their minds.  However, they faithfully made a full report to Asprenas, on whose  instructions they boarded the ship and killed the impostor, whoever he  was. The man's eyes and hair and ferocious look were so remarkable  that the body was carried into Asia and thence to Rome.    FOOTNOTES:        [201] The Flavian dynasty.
