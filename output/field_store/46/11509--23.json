Excommunication was usually imposed for failure  to obey an order or showing contempt of the law or of the courts.  It required a due process hearing and a written reason. If this  measure failed, it was possible to turn the offender over to the  state for punishment, e.g. for blasphemy or heresy. Blasphemy  [speaking ill of God] was thought to cause God's wrath expressed  in famine, pestilence, and earthquake and was usually punished  by a fine or corporal punishment, e.g. perforation or amputation  of the tongue. It was tacitly understood that the punishment for  heresy was death by burning. The state usually assured itself  the sentence was just before imposing it. The court of the rural  dean was the ecclesiastical parallel of the hundred court of  secular jurisdiction and usually had the same land boundaries.          Chapter 6    The Times: 1154-1215    King Henry II and Queen Eleanor, who was twelve years older, were  both intelligent, educated, energetic, well-traveled, and  experienced in affairs of state. Henry was the first Norman King  to be fully literate. Eleanor often served as regent during  Henry's reign and the reigns of their two sons: Richard, the  Lion-Hearted, and John. Henry II was a modest, courteous, and  patient man with an astonishing memory and strong personality.  He was indifferent to rank and impatient of pomp to the point of  being careless about his appearance. He usually dressed in  riding clothes and was often unkempt. He was thrifty, but  generous to the poor.    Henry revived and augmented the laws and institutions of his  grandfather, Henry I, and developed them to a new perfection.  Almost all legal and fiscal institutions appear in their first  effective form during his reign. For instance, he  institutionalized the assize for a specific function in judicial  proceedings, whereas before it had been an ad hoc body used for  various purposes.    Henry's government practiced a strict economy and he never  exploited the growing wealth of the nation. He abhorred  bloodshed and the sacrifice of men's lives. So he strove  diligently to keep the peace, when possible by gifts of money,  but otherwise with armed force. Foreign merchants with precious  goods could journey safely through the land from fair to fair.  These fairs were usually held in the early fall, after  sheep-shearing and harvesting. Frankpledge was revived. No  stranger could stay overnight (except for one night in a  borough), unless sureties were given for his good behavior. A  list of such strangers was to be given to itinerant judges.    Henry had character and the foresight to build up a centralized  system of government that would survive him. He learned about  the shires' and villages' varying laws and customs. Then, using  the model of Roman law, he gave to English institutions that  unity and system which in their casual patch-work development  had been lacking. Henry's government and courts forged permanent  direct links between the King and his subjects which cut through  the feudal structure of lords and vassals.    He developed the methods and structure of government so that  there was a great increase in the scope of administrative  activity without a concurrent increase of personal power of the  officials who discharged it. The government was self- regulating,  with methods of accounting and control which meant that no  official, however exalted, could entirely escape the  surveillance of his colleagues and the King. At the same time,  administrative and judicial procedures were perfected so that  much which had previously required the King's personal attention  was reduced to routine.    The royal household translated the royal will into action. In the  early 1100s, there had been very little machinery of central  government that was not closely associated with the royal  household. Royal government was largely built upon what had once  been purely domestic offices. Kings had called upon their  chaplains to pen letters for them. By Henry II's reign, the  Chancery was a highly efficient writing office through which the  King's will was expressed in a flow of writs, and the Chancellor  an important and highly rewarded official, but he was still  responsible for organizing the services in the royal chapel.  Similarly, the chamberlains ran the household's financial  departments. They arranged to have money brought in from a  convenient castle-treasury, collected money from sheriffs or the  King's debtors, arranged loans with the usurers, and supervised  the spending of it. It was spent for daily domestic needs, the  King's almsgiving, and the mounting of a military campaign. But  they were still responsible for personal attendance upon the  King in his privy chamber, taking care of his valuable furs,  jewels, and documents, and changing his bedlinens. There were  four other departments of the household. The steward presided  over the hall and kitchens and was responsible for supplying the  household and guests with food supplies. The butler had duties  in the hall and cellars and was responsible for the supply of  wine and ale. The marshall arranged lodgings for the King's  court as it moved about from palaces to hunting lodges, arranged  the pay of the household servants, and supervised the work of  ushers, watchmen, fire-tenders, messengers and huntsmen. The  constable organized the bodyguard and escorts, arranged for the  supply of castles, and mustered the royal army.    Henry brought order and unity by making the King's Royal Court  the common court of the land. Its purpose was to guard the  King's peace by protecting all people of free status throughout  the nation and correct the disparity in punishments given by  local courts. Heretofore, the scope of the King's peace had  varied to as little as the King's presence, his land, and his  highway. The royal demesne had shrunk to about 5% of the land.  The Common Law for all the nation was established by example of  the King's Royal Court.    A system of writs originated well-defined actions in the royal  courts. This system determined the Royal Court's jurisdiction as  against the church, lords, and sheriffs. It limited the  jurisdiction of all other courts and subordinated them to the  Royal Court. Inquests into any misdeeds of sheriffs were held,  which could result in their dismissal.    Before Henry's reign, the church had become more powerful and  asserted more authority. Henry tried to return to the concept of  the King being appointed by God and as he head of the church as  well as of the state, as in Henry I's time. Toward this end, he  published the Constitutions of Clarendon. But the Archbishop of  Canterbury, Thomas Becket, refused to agree to them. The  disageement came to a head in Henry's attempt to establish the  principle of \"one law to all\" by having church clerics punished  by the civil courts as before, instead of having \"benefit of  clergy\" to be tried only in ecclesiastical courts, even for  secular crimes. Clerics composed about one-sixth the population.  The church courts had characteristically punished with a fine or  a penance, and at most defrocking, and never imposed a death  penalty, even for murder. When Archbishop Becket was murdered  and became a martyr, \"benefit of clergy\" became a standard right.  Appeals could be made to the Pope without the King's permission.  The King could take a criminal cleric's chattels, but not his  life. However, though theoretically the bishops were elective,  as a practical matter, the King appointed the bishops and the  abbots.    Henry and Eleanor spoke many languages and liked discussing law,  philosophy, and history. So they gathered wise and learned man  about them, who became known as courtiers, rather than people of  social rank. They lived in the great and strong Tower of London,  which had been extended as had other castles, so that the whole  castle and grounds were defended instead of just the main  building. On the west were two strongly fortified castles  surrounded by a high and deeply entrenched wall, which had seven  double gates. Towers were spaced along the north wall and the  Thames River flowed below the south wall. To the west was the  city, where royal friends had residences with adjoining gardens  near the royal palace at Westminster. The court was a center of  culture as well as of government. The game of backgammon was  played. People wore belts with buckles, usually brass, instead  of knotting their belts.    London extended about a mile along the river and about half a  mile inland. Most of its houses were two stories, the ground  floor having booths and workshops, and the upper floor living  space. Most of the houses were wooden structures. The richer  merchants' and knights' houses were built of stone. Walls between  houses had to be stone and thatched roofs were banned because  there had been many fires. So roofs were tiled with red-brick  tiles. There were over a hundred churches in the city, which  celebrated feast days, gave alms and hospitality to strangers,  confirmed betrothals, contracted marriages, celebrated weddings,  conducted funerals, and buried the dead. Fish and no meat was  eaten on Fridays and during lent. There was dark rye bread and  expensive white wheat bread. Vegetables included onions, leeks,  and cabbage. Fruits included apples, pears, plums, cherries, and  strawberries. Water was obtained from streams running through  the town to the river and from springs. There were craft guilds  of bakers, butchers, clothworkers, and saddlers, as well as of  weavers. Vendors, craftsmen, and laborers had their customary  places, which they took up every morning. Some vendors walked  the streets announcing their wares for sale.    In London, bells heralded the start and finish of all organized  business. At sunset, the gates of the town were closed for the  night. Only the rich could afford wax candles; others had  home-made tallow "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16940"],[0,"Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh (#18)"],[1,"devout that dwell in the mansions of Paradise. The  Concourse on high, and they that inhabit the Cities of the Names of God,  weep over thee, and bewail the things that have befallen thee.    Thou art still the symbol of the names and attributes of the Almighty, the  Point towards which the eyes of the Lord of earth and heaven are directed.  There hath befallen thee what hath befallen the Ark in which God's pledge  of security had been made to dwell. Well is it with him that apprehendeth  the intent of these words, and recognizeth the purpose of Him Who is the  Lord of all creation.    Happy are those that inhale from thee the sweet savors of the Merciful,  that acknowledge thine exaltation, that safeguard thy sanctity, that  reverence, at all times, thy station. We implore the Almighty to grant  that the eyes of those who have turned away from thee, and failed to  appreciate thy worth, may be opened, that they may truly recognize thee,  and Him Who, through the power of truth, hath raised thee up on high.  Blind, indeed, are they about thee, and utterly unaware of thee in this  day. Thy Lord is, verily, the Gracious, the Forgiving.    I bear witness that through thee God hath proved the hearts of His  servants. Blessed be the man that directeth his steps toward thee, and  visiteth thee. Woe to him that denieth thy right, that turneth away from  thee, that dishonoreth thy name, and profaneth thy holiness.    Grieve not, O House of God, if the veil of thy sanctity be rent asunder by  the infidels. God hath, in the world of creation, adorned thee with the  jewel of His remembrance. Such an ornament no man can, at any time,  profane. Towards thee the eyes of thy Lord shall, under all conditions,  remain directed. He, verily, will incline His ear to the prayer of every  one that visiteth thee, who will circle around thee, and calleth upon Him  in thy name. He, in truth, is the Forgiving, the All-Merciful.    I beseech Thee, O my God, by this House that hath suffered such change in  its separation from Thee, that bewaileth its remoteness from Thy presence,  and lamenteth Thy tribulation, to forgive me, and my parents, and my  kindred, and such of my brethren as have believed in Thee. Grant that all  my needs be satisfied, through Thy bounty, O Thou Who art the King of  Names. Thou art the most Bountiful of the bountiful, the Lord of all  worlds.            LVIII: CALL THOU TO MIND THAT WHICH HATH BEEN...      Call thou to mind that which hath been revealed unto Mihdi, Our servant,  in the first year of Our banishment to the Land of Mystery (Adrianople).  Unto him have We predicted that which must befall Our House (Ba_gh_dad  House), in the days to come, lest he grieve over the acts of robbery and  violence already perpetrated against it. Verily, the Lord, thy God,  knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth.    To him We have written: This is not the first humiliation inflicted upon  My House. In days gone by the hand of the oppressor hath heaped  indignities upon it. Verily, it shall be so abased in the days to come as  to cause tears to flow from every discerning eye. Thus have We unfolded to  thee things hidden beyond the veil, inscrutable to all save God, the  Almighty, the All-Praised. In the fullness of time, the Lord shall, by the  power of truth, exalt it in the eyes of all men. He shall cause it to  become the Standard of His Kingdom, the Shrine round which will circle the  concourse of the faithful. Thus hath spoken the Lord, thy God, ere the day  of lamentation arriveth. This revelation have We given thee in Our holy  Tablet, lest thou sorrow for what hath befallen Our House through the  assaults of the enemy. All praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.            LIX: EVERY UNBIASED OBSERVER WILL READILY ADMIT...      Every unbiased observer will readily admit that, ever since the dawn of  His Revelation, this wronged One hath invited all mankind to turn their  faces towards the Day Spring of Glory, and hath forbidden corruption,  hatred, oppression, and wickedness. And yet, behold what the hand of the  oppressor hath wrought! No pen dare describe his tyranny. Though the  purpose of Him Who is the Eternal Truth hath been to confer everlasting  life upon all men, and ensure their security and peace, yet witness how  they have arisen to shed the blood of His loved ones, and have pronounced  on Him the sentence of death.    The instigators of this oppression are those very persons who, though so  foolish, are reputed the wisest of the wise. Such is their blindness that,  with unfeigned severity, they have cast into this fortified and afflictive  Prison Him, for the servants of Whose Threshold the world hath been  created. The Almighty, however, in spite of them and those that have  repudiated the truth of this \"Great Announcement,\" hath transformed this  Prison House into the Most Exalted Paradise, the Heaven of Heavens.    We did not refuse such material benefits as could relieve Us from Our  afflictions. Every one of Our companions, however, will bear Us witness  that Our holy court is sanctified from, and far above, such material  benefits. We have nevertheless accepted, while confined in this Prison,  those things of which the infidels have striven to deprive Us. If a man be  found willing to rear, in Our name, an edifice of pure gold or silver, or  a house begemmed with stones of inestimable value, such a wish will no  doubt be granted. He, verily, doeth what He willeth, and ordaineth that  which He pleaseth. Leave hath, moreover, been given to whosoever may  desire to raise, throughout the length and breadth of this land, noble and  imposing structures, and dedicate the rich and sacred territories  adjoining the Jordan and its vicinity to the worship and service of the  one true God, magnified be His glory, that the prophecies recorded by the  Pen of the Most High in the sacred Scriptures may be fulfilled, and that  which God, the Lord of all worlds, hath purposed in this most exalted,  this most holy, this mighty, and wondrous Revelation may be made manifest.    We have, of old, uttered these words: Spread thy skirt, O Jerusalem!  Ponder this in your hearts, O people of Baha, and render thanks unto your  Lord, the Expounder, the Most Manifest.    Were the mysteries, that are known to none except God, to be unraveled,  the whole of mankind would witness the evidences of perfect and consummate  justice. With a certitude that none can question, all men would cleave to  His commandments, and would scrupulously observe them. We, verily, have  decreed in Our Book a goodly and bountiful reward to whosoever will turn  away from wickedness and lead a chaste and godly life. He, in truth, is  the Great Giver, the All-Bountiful.            LX: MY CAPTIVITY CAN BRING ON ME NO SHAME....      My captivity can bring on Me no shame. Nay, by My life, it conferreth on  Me glory. That which can make Me ashamed is the conduct of such of My  followers as profess to love Me, yet in fact follow the Evil One. They,  indeed, are of the lost.    When the time set for this Revelation was fulfilled, and He Who is the Day  Star of the world appeared in 'Iraq, He bade His followers observe that  which would sanctify them from all earthly defilements. Some preferred to  follow the desires of a corrupt inclination, while others walked in the  way of righteousness and truth, and were rightly guided.    Say: He is not to be numbered with the people of Baha who followeth his  mundane desires, or fixeth his heart on things of the earth. He is My true  follower who, if he come to a valley of pure gold, will pass straight  through it aloof as a cloud, and will neither turn back, nor pause. Such a  man is, assuredly, of Me. From his garment the Concourse on high can  inhale the fragrance of sanctity.... And if he met the fairest and most  comely of women, he would not feel his heart seduced by the least shadow  of desire for her beauty. Such an one, indeed, is the creation of spotless  chastity. Thus instructeth you the Pen of the Ancient of Days, as bidden  by your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.            LXI: THE WORLD IS IN TRAVAIL, AND ITS AGITATION...      The world is in travail, and its agitation waxeth day by day. Its face is  turned towards waywardness and unbelief. Such shall be its plight, that to  disclose it now would not be meet and seemly. Its perversity will long  continue. And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear  that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake. Then, and only then,  will the Divine Standard be unfurled, and the Nightingale of Paradise  warble its melody.            LXII: RECALL THOU TO MIND MY SORROWS, MY CARES...      Recall thou to mind My sorrows, My cares and anxieties, My woes and  trials, the state of My captivity, the tears that I have shed, the  bitterness of Mine anguish, and now My imprisonment in this far-off land.  God, O Mustafa, beareth Me witness. Couldst thou be told what hath  befallen the Ancient Beauty, thou wouldst flee into the wilderness, and  weep with a great weeping. In thy grief, thou wouldst smite thyself on the  head, and cry out as one stung by the sting of the adder. Be thou grateful  to God, that We have refused to divulge unto thee the secrets of those  unsearchable decrees that have been sent down unto Us from the heaven of  the Will of thy Lord, the Most Powerful, the Almighty.    By the righteousness of God! Every morning I arose from My bed, I  discovered the hosts of countless afflictions massed behind My door; and  every night when I lay down, lo! My heart was torn with agony at what it  had suffered from the fiendish cruelty of its foes. With every piece of  bread the Ancient Beauty breaketh is coupled the assault of a fresh  affliction, and with every drop He drinketh is mixed the bitterness of the  most woeful of trials. He is preceded in every step He taketh by an army  of unforeseen"]]]
