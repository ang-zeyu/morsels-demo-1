Washington took  command of the army under a great elm, which is still standing. There,  six months later, he raised the first American flag.[17]    [Illustration: THE NORTHERN STATES IN THE REVOLUTION.]    [Footnote 17: See a picture of this and the other flags of the  Revolution in paragraph 142.]      136. American sharpshooters;[18] Washington's need of cannon and  powder; the attack on Canada; the British driven out of Boston.--Men  now came from all parts of the country to join the Continental Army.  Many of them were sharpshooters. In one case an officer set up a board  with the figure of a man's nose chalked on it, for a mark. A hundred  men fired at it at long distance, and sixty hit the nose. The  newspapers gave them great praise for their skill and said, \"Now,  General Gage, look out for _your_ nose.\"    [Illustration: \"NOW, GENERAL GAGE, LOOK OUT FOR _your_ NOSE.\"]    Washington wanted to drive General Gage and the British soldiers out  of Boston, but for months he could not get either cannon or powder.  Benjamin Franklin said that we should have to fight as the Indians  used to, with bows and arrows.    While Washington was waiting, a number of Americans marched against  the British in Canada; but the cold weather came on, and they nearly  starved to death: our men would sometimes take off their  moccasins[19] and gnaw them, while they danced in the snow to keep  their bare feet from freezing.    At last Washington got both cannon and powder. He dragged the cannon  up to the top of some high land overlooking Boston harbor. He then  sent word to General Howe, for Gage had gone, that if he did not leave  Boston he would knock his ships to pieces. The British saw that they  could not help themselves, so they made haste to get on board their  vessels and sail away. They never came back to Boston again, but went  to New York.    [Footnote 18: Sharpshooters: men who can fire and hit a small mark  with a bullet at a long distance.]    [Footnote 19: Moccasins (mok'ka-sins): Indian shoes made of  deerskin.]      137. The Declaration of Independence; \"Down with the king!\"  Washington is driven from New York and across the Delaware  River.--Washington got to New York first. While he was there,  Congress,[20] on the 4th of July, 1776, declared the United States  _independent_--that is, entirely free from the rule of the king of  England. There was a gilded lead statue of King George the Third on  horseback in New York. When the news of what Congress had done reached  that city, there was a great cry of \"Down with the king!\" That night  some of our men pulled down the statue, melted it up, and cast it  into bullets.    [Illustration: \"DOWN WITH THE KING!\"]    The next month there was a battle on Long Island,[21] just across  from New York City; the British gained the victory. Washington had  to leave New York, and Lord Cornwallis, one of the British generals,  chased him and his little army clear across the state of New Jersey.  It looked at one time as though our men would all be taken prisoners,  but Washington managed to seize a lot of small boats on the Delaware  River[22] and get across into Pennsylvania: as the British had no  boats, they could not follow.    [Footnote 20: Congress: see footnote 14 in paragraph 133.]    [Footnote 21: See map in paragraph 135.]    [Footnote 22: See map in paragraph 135.]      138. Washington's victory at Trenton, New Jersey.--Lord Cornwallis  left fifteen hundred German soldiers at Trenton on the Delaware. He  intended, as soon as the river froze over, to cross on the ice and  attack Washington's army. But Washington did not wait for him. On  Christmas night (1776) he took a large number of boats, filled them  with soldiers, and secretly crossed over to New Jersey.[23] The  weather was intensely cold, the river was full of floating ice, and  a furious snow-storm set in. Many of our men were ragged and had only  old broken shoes. They suffered terribly, and two of them were frozen  to death.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE RIVER.]    The Germans at Trenton had been having a jolly Christmas, and had  gone to bed, suspecting no danger. Suddenly Washington, with his men,  rushed into the little town, and almost before they knew what had  happened, a thousand Germans were made prisoners. The rest escaped  to tell Lord Cornwallis how the Americans had beaten them. When  Washington was driven out of New York, many Americans thought he  would be captured. Now they were filled with joy. The battle of  Trenton was the first battle won by the Continental Army.    [Footnote 23: See map in paragraph 135.]      139. Our victory at Princeton, New Jersey; the British take  Philadelphia; winter at Valley Forge; Burgoyne beaten; the king of  France agrees to help us.--Washington took his thousand prisoners  over into Pennsylvania. A few days later he again crossed the  Delaware into New Jersey. While Cornwallis was fast asleep in his  tent, he slipped round him, got to Princeton,[24] and there beat a  part of the British army. Cornwallis woke up and heard Washington's  cannon. \"That's thunder,\" he said. He was right; it was the thunder  of another American victory.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON ON HORSEBACK.]    But before the next winter set in, the British had taken the city  of Philadelphia, then the capital of the United States. Washington's  army was freezing and starving on the hillsides of Valley Forge,[25]  about twenty miles northwest of Philadelphia.    But good news was coming. The Americans had won a great victory at  Saratoga, New York,[26] over the British general, Burgoyne.[27] Dr.  Franklin was then in Paris. When he heard that Burgoyne was beaten,  he hurried off to the palace of the French king to tell him about  it. The king of France hated the British, and he agreed to send money,  ships, and soldiers to help us. When our men heard that at Valley  Forge, they leaped and hurrahed for joy. Not long after that the  British left Philadelphia, and we entered it in triumph.    [Footnote 24: Princeton: see map in paragraph 135.]    [Footnote 25: Valley Forge: see map in paragraph 135.]    [Footnote 26: Saratoga: see map in paragraph 135.]    [Footnote 27: Burgoyne (Bur'goin).]      140. The war at the South; Jasper; Cowpens; Greene and  Cornwallis.--While these things were happening at the north, the  British sent a fleet of vessels to take Charleston, South Carolina.  They hammered away with their big guns at a little log fort under  command of Colonel Moultrie. In the battle a cannon-ball struck the  flag-pole on the fort, and cut it in two. The South Carolina flag  fell to the ground outside the fort. Sergeant[28] William Jasper  leaped down, and, while the British shot were striking all around  him, seized the flag, climbed back, fastened it to a short staff,  and raised it to its place, to show that the Americans would never  give up the fort. The British, after fighting all day, saw that they  could do nothing against palmetto logs[29] when defended by such men  as Moultrie and Jasper; so they sailed away with such of their ships  as had not been destroyed.    [Illustration: SERGEANT JASPER AND THE FLAG.]    Several years later, Charleston was taken. Lord Cornwallis then took  command of the British army in South Carolina. General Greene, of  Rhode Island, had command of the Americans. He sent Daniel Morgan  with his sharpshooters to meet part of the British army at  Cowpens;[30] they did meet them, and sent them flying. Then  Cornwallis determined to either whip General Greene or drive him out  of the state. But General Greene worried Cornwallis so that at last  he was glad enough to get into Virginia. He had found North and South  Carolina like two hornets' nests, and the further he got away from  those hornets, the better he was pleased.    [Illustration: THE SOUTHERN STATES IN THE REVOLUTION.]    [Footnote 28: Sergeant (sar'jent): a military officer of low rank.]    [Footnote 29: Palmetto logs: the wood of the palmetto tree is very  soft and spongy; the cannon-balls, when they struck, would bury  themselves in the logs, but would neither break them to pieces nor  go through them.]    [Footnote 30: Cowpens: see map in this paragraph.]      141. Cornwallis and Benedict Arnold; Lafayette; Cornwallis shuts  himself up in Yorktown.--When Lord Cornwallis got into Virginia he  found Benedict Arnold waiting to help him. Arnold had been a general  in the American army; Washington gave him the command of the fort  at West Point, on the Hudson River,[31] and trusted him as though  he was his brother. Arnold deceived him, and secretly offered to give  up the fort to the British. We call a man who is false to his friends  and to his country a traitor: it is the most shameful name we can  fasten on him. Arnold was a traitor; and if we could have caught him,  we should have hanged him; but he was cunning enough to run away and  escape to the British. Now he was burning houses and towns in Virginia,  and doing all that he could--as a traitor always will--to destroy  those who had once been his best friends. He wanted to stay in  Virginia and assist Cornwallis; but that general was a brave and  honorable man: he despised Arnold, and did not want to have anything  to do with him.    A young nobleman named Lafayette[32] had come over from France on  purpose to help us against the British. Cornwallis laughed at him  and called him a \"boy\"; but he found that General Lafayette was a  \"boy\" who knew how to fight. The British commander moved toward the  seacoast; Lafayette followed him; at length Cornwallis shut himself  up with his army in Yorktown.[33]    [Footnote 31: West Point: see map in paragraph 135.]    [Footnote 32: Lafayette (Lah-fay-et').]    [Footnote 33: Yorktown: see map in paragraph 140.]      142."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#18)"],[1,"ge, showing his  bleeding hand, but he was received with a mocking smirk and a curt  command to \"Move on!\" The weaker burdened prisoners lagged, but the  bayonet revived them. One or two gave out completely, but others, such  as myself, who were not encumbered, extended a helping hand,  half-carrying them up the hill.    Reaching the camp the Commanding Officer, a friendly old General whose  name I never heard, hurried up.    \"What's the meaning of this?\" he blurted out in amazement.    \"Prisoners of war for internment!\" replied our officer-in-charge.    \"But I don't know anything about them. I have received no instructions.  There is no accommodation for them here!\" protested the General.    Our officer produced his imposing sheaf of papers and the two  disappeared into the office.    The feelings of the party at this intelligence may be conceived. The  majority dropped, in a state of semi-collapse in the sand, their  belongings strewn around them, utter dejection written on their faces.    After what I had experienced at Wesel I was prepared for anything. I had  already learned the futility of giving way. I felt no inclination to sit  or lie in the blistering sand. I caught sight of a stretch of inviting  turf, made my way to it, and threw myself down upon it. But I was not to  enjoy the luxury of Nature's couch. A soldier came bustling up and  before I grasped his intentions I was hustled off, with the intimation  that if I wanted to lie down I must do so in the sand.    The fact that no arrangements had been made for our reception was only  too obvious. It was about noon when the two officers disappeared into  the official building to discuss the papers referring to our arrival,  and it was six in the evening before they had come to any decision.  Throughout these six hours we were left lying on the scorching sand in  the broiling sun without a bite of food. Seeing that many of us had  eaten little or nothing since the early evening of the previous day it  is not surprising that the greater part were knocked up. One or two of  us caught sight of the canteen provided for the convenience of recruits,  and succeeded in getting a few mouthfuls, but they were not worth  consideration. I myself whiled away the time by enjoying a wash at the  pump and giving myself the luxury of a shave. I bought a small cake of  coarse soap and never enjoyed an ablution so keenly as that _al fresco_  wash, shave, shampoo, and brush-up at Sennelager. When I came back  thoroughly refreshed I had changed my appearance so completely that I  was scarcely recognised. Even the soldiers looked at me twice to make  sure I was the correct man.    Later a doctor appeared upon the scene. His name was Dr. Ascher, and as  events proved he was the only friend we ever had in the camp. He  enquired if any one felt ill. Needless to say a goodly number, suffering  from hunger, thirst and fatigue, responded to his enquiry. Realising the  reason for their unfortunate plight he bustled up to the Commanding  Officer and emphasised the urgent necessity to give us a meal. But he  was not entirely successful. Then he inspected us one by one, giving a  cheering word here, and cracking a friendly joke there. The hand of  Prince L---- received instant attention, while other slight injuries  were also sympathetically treated. The hearts of one and all went out to  this ministering angel, to whose work and indefatigable efforts on our  behalf I refer in a subsequent chapter.    At last we were ordered to the barracks near by. It was a large masonry  building, each room being provided with beds and straw upon the floor.  Subsequently, however, we were moved to less comfortable quarters where  there were three buildings in one, but subdivided by thick masonry  walls, thereby preventing all intercommunication. Here our sleeping  accommodation comprised bunks, disposed in two tiers, made of wood and  with a sack as a mattress.    Whether it is my natural disposition or ancestral blood I do not know,  but it has ever been my practice in life to emulate Mark Tapley and to  see the humorous aspect of the most depressing situation. The \"luxurious  hotel,\" to which we were consigned according \"to the best and most noble  traditions of German honour,\" moved me to unrestrained mirth, when once  I had taken in our surroundings. My levity fell like a cold water douche  upon my companions, while the guards frowned menacingly. But to me it  was impossible to refrain from an outburst of merriment. It was quite in  accordance with German promises, which are composed of the two  ingredients--uncompromising bluff and unabashed deliberate lying,  leavened with a sprinkling of disarming suavity. I had tasted this  characteristic at Wesel and frankly was not a bit surprised at anything  which loomed up, always resolving at all hazards to make the best of an  uncomfortable position.    Upon turning into our unattractive suite our first proceeding was to  elect a Captain of our barrack. Selection fell upon Mr. K----, as he was  an ideal intermediary, being fluent in the language. We turned in, the  majority being too tired to growl at their lot, but there was precious  little sleep. During the day, the heat at Sennelager in the summer is  intolerable, but during the night it is freezing. Our arrival not having  been anticipated, we had nothing with which to keep ourselves warm. A  few days passed before the luxury of a blanket was bestowed upon us.    The morning after our arrival we drew up an imposing list of complaints  for which we demanded immediate redress. We also expressed in detail our  requirements, which we requested to be fulfilled forthwith. Then we  decided to apportion this part of the camp for cricket, that for general  recreation and so forth. By the time we had completed our intentions,  all of which were carried unanimously, several sheets of foolscap had  been filled, or rather would have been filled had we been possessed of  any paper. This duty completed we set out upon an exploring expedition,  intending to inspect all corners of the camp. But if we thought we were  going to wander whither we pleased we were soon disillusioned. We were  huddled in one corner and our boundaries, although undefined in the  concrete were substantial in the abstract, being imaginary lines run  between sentries standing with loaded rifles and fixed bayonets.    One and all wondered how we should be able to pass away the time. We  could neither write nor read owing to a complete lack of facilities.  Idleness would surely drive us crazy. Our recreations were severely  limited, depending upon our own ingenuity. For the first few days we  could do nothing beyond promenading, discussing the war and our  situation. These two subjects were speedily worn thread-bare since we  knew nothing about the first topic and were only able to speculate  vaguely about the second. The idea of being made to work never entered  our heads for a moment. Were we not civilian prisoners of war: the  victims of circumstances under the shield of the best traditions of  German honour?    But we were not the first arrivals at Sennelager. We were preceded by a  few hours by a party of French soldiers--captives of war. They were  extremely sullen. Travel and battle-stained they crouched and stretched  themselves upon the ground. Whence they came I was never able to  discover. One or two of our party who were versed in the French tongue  endeavoured to draw them into conversation, but to no purpose. They  either replied in vague monosyllables or deliberately ignored the  questions. There is no doubt the poor fellows felt their early capture  very sorely, and had accordingly sunk into the depths of despair. Sulky  and morose they glared fiercely upon any approach, and when they did  anything it was with an ill-grace impossible to describe. Indeed, they  were so downcast that they refused to pay the slightest attention to  their personal appearance, which accentuated their forbidding aspect.    Killing time as best we could, doing nothing soon began to reveal its  ill-effects upon those who, like myself, had always led an active life.  I approached Dr. Ascher, explained that idleness would drive me mad, and  petitioned him to permit me to work in the hospital. I did not care what  the job was so long as it effectively kept me employed. He sympathised  with my suggestion and hurried off to the Commanding Officer. But he  came back shaking his head negatively. The authorities would not  entertain the proposal for an instant.    Suddenly we were paraded. Rakes and brooms were served out to every man  and we were curtly ordered to sweep the roads. We buckled into this  task. But the dust was thick and the day was hot. Soon we were all  perspiring freely. But we were not permitted to rest. Over us was placed  a bull-headed, fierce-looking Prussian soldier armed with a murderous  looking whip. I should think he had been an animal trainer before being  mobilised from the manner in which he cracked that whip. When he saw any  one taking a breather up he came, glaring menacingly and cracking the  whip with the ferocity of a lion-tamer. We evinced a quaint respect for  that whip, and I firmly believe that our guardian inwardly fretted and  fumed because he was denied the opportunity to lay it across our backs.  Several of us nearly got it, however.    We were sweeping away merrily when, suddenly, we gave way to a wild  outburst of mirth. One couldn't sweep for laughing. The guards around us  looked on in wonder.    \"Christopher! boys!\" I at last blurted out, \"We were talking just now  about recreation, and were emphatic about what we were, and were not,  going to do. I reckon this wants a lot of beating for recreation!\" The  oddity of the situation so tickled us that we had to collapse from  laughter.    But a warning shout brought us to our feet. Mr. Mobilised Lion Tamer was  bearing down upon us waving his whip. He lashed"]]]
