Nevertheless, considerable damage was sustained, and  the fury of the angry waves forced them back again to the shore. The  monks deeming this an indication of God's will that they should remain,  decided upon doing so, and leaving the ship, they agreed to proceed on  their way rejoicing, and place still greater trust in the mercy of God  and the miraculous influence of St. Cuthbert's holy bones; but some whose  reliance on Divine providence appears not so conspicuous, became  dissatisfied, and separated from the rest till at last only seven monks  were left besides their bishop and abbot. Their relics were too numerous  and too cumbersome to be conveyed by so small a number, and they knew not  how to proceed; but one of the seven whose name was Hanred had a vision,  wherein he was told that they should repair to the sea, where they would  find a book of Gospels adorned with gold and precious stones, which had  been lost out of the ship when they were in the storm; and that after  that he should see a bridle hanging on a tree, which he should take down  and put upon a horse that would come to him, which horse he should put to  a cart he would also find, to carry the holy body, which would be an ease  to them. All these things happening accordingly, they travelled with more  comfort, following the horse, which way soever he should lead. The book  above mentioned was no ways damaged by the water, and is still preserved  in the library at Durham,[161] where it remained till the Reformation,  when it was stript of its jewelled covering, and after passing through  many hands, ultimately came into the possession of Sir Robert Cotton, in  whose collection, as we have said before, it is now preserved in the  British Museum.    I cannot refrain, even at the risk of incurring some blame for my  digression, presenting the reader with a part of a letter full of  fraternal love, which Alcuin addressed to the monks of Lindesfarne on  this sad occasion.    \"Your dearest fraternity,\" says he, \"was wont to afford me much joy. But  now how different! though absent, I deeply lament the more your  tribulations and calamities; the manner in which the Pagans contaminate  the sanctuaries of God, and shed the blood of saints around the altar,  devastating the joy of our house, and trampling on the bodies of holy men  in the temple of God, as though they were treading on a dunghill in the  street. But of what effect is our wailing unless we come before the  altars of Christ and cry, 'Spare me, O Lord! spare thy people, and take  not thine inheritance from them;' nor let the Pagans say, 'Where is the  God of the Christians?' Besides who is to pacify the churches of Britain,  if St. Cuthbert cannot defend them with so great a number of saints?  Nevertheless do not trouble the mind about these things, for God  chasteneth all the sons whom he receiveth, and therefore perhaps afflicts  you the more, because he the more loveth you. Jerusalem, the delightful  city of God, was lost by the Chaldean scourge; and Rome, the city of the  holy Apostles and innumerable martyrs, was surrounded by the Pagans and  devastated. Well nigh the whole of Europe is evacuated by the scourging  sword of the Goths or the Huns. But in the same manner in which God  preserved the stars to illuminate the heavens, so will He preserve the  churches to ornament, and in their office to strengthen and increase the  Christian religion.\"[162]    Thus it came to pass that Eardulphus was the last bishop of Lindesfarne  and the first of Cunecacestre, or Chester-upon-the-Street, to which place  his see was removed previous to its final settlement at Durham.    After a succession of many bishops, some recorded as learned and bookish  by monkish annalists, and nearly all benefactors in some way to their  church, we arrive at the period when Aldwine was consecrated bishop of  that see in the year 990. The commotions of his time made his presidency  a troubled and harassing one. Sweyn, king of Denmark, and Olauis, king of  Norway, invaded England, and spreading themselves in bodies over the  kingdom, committed many and cruel depredations; a strong body of these  infested the northern coast, and approached the vicinity of  Chester-on-the-Street. This so alarmed Aldwine, that he resolved to quit  his church--for the great riches and numerous relics of that holy place  were attractive objects to the plundering propensities of the invaders.  Carrying, therefore, the bones of St. Cuthbert with them--for that box of  mortal dust was ever precious in the sight of those old monks--and the  costly treasures of the church, not forgetting their books, the monks  fled to Ripon, and the see, which after similar adversities their  predecessors one hundred and thirteen years ago had settled at Chester,  was forever removed. It is true three or four months after, as Symeon of  Durham tells us, they attempted to return, but when they reached a place  called Werdelan, \"on the east and near unto Durham,\" they could not move  the bier on which the body of St. Cuthbert was carried, although they  applied their united strength to effect it. The superstition, or perhaps  simplicity, of the monks instantly interpreted this into a manifestation  of divine interference, and they resolved not to return again to their  old spot. And we are further told that after three days' fasting and  prayer, the Lord vouchsafed to reveal to them that they should bear the  saintly burden to Durham, a command which they piously and cheerfully  obeyed. Having arrived there, they fixed on a wild and uncultivated site,  and making a simple oratory of wattles for the temporary reception of  their relics, they set zealously to work--for these old monks well knew  what labor was--to cut down wood, to clear the ground, and build an  habitation for themselves. Shortly after, in the wilderness of that  neglected spot, the worthy bishop Aldwine erected a goodly church of  stone to the honor of God, and as a humble tribute of gratitude and love;  and so it was that Aldwine, the last bishop of Chester-on-the-Street,  was the first of Durham.    When William Carelepho, a Norman monk, was consecrated bishop, the church  had so increased in wealth and usefulness, that fresh wants arose, more  space was requisite, and a grander structure would be preferable; the  bishop thereupon pulled the old church of Aldwine down and commenced the  erection of a more magnificent one in its place, as the beauty of Durham  cathedral sufficiently testifies even now; and will not the lover of  artistic beauty award his praise to the Norman bishop--those massive  columns and stupendous arches excite the admiring wonder of all; built on  a rocky eminence and surrounded by all the charms of a romantic scenery,  it is one of the finest specimens of architecture which the enthusiasm of  monkish days dedicated to piety and to God. Its liberal founder however  did not live to see it finished, for he died in the year 1095, two years  after laying its foundation stone. His bookloving propensities have been  honorably recorded, and not only was he fond of reading, but kept the  pens of the scribes in constant motion, and used himself to superintend  the transcription of manuscripts, as the colophon of a folio volume in  Durham library fully proves.[163] The monkish bibliophiles of his church  received from him a precious gift of about 40 volumes, containing among  other valuable books Prosper, Pompeii, Tertullian, and a great Bible in  two volumes.[164]    It would have been difficult perhaps to have found in those days a body  of monks so \"bookish\" as those of Durham; not only did they transcribe  with astonishing rapidity, proving that there was no want of vellum  there, but they must have bought or otherwise collected a great number of  books; for the see of Durham, in the early part of the 12th century,  could show a library embracing nearly 300 volumes.[165]    Nor let the reader imagine that the collection possessed no merit in a  literary point of view, or that the monks cared for little else save  legends of saints or the literature of the church; the catalogue proves  them to have enjoyed a more liberal and a more refined taste, and again  display the cloistered students of the middle ages as the preservers of  classic learning. This is a point worth observing on looking over the old  parchment catalogues of the monks; for as by their Epistles we obtain a  knowledge of their intimacy with the old writers, and the use they made  of them, so by their catalogues we catch a glimpse of the means they  possessed of becoming personally acquainted with their beauties; by the  process much light may be thrown on the gloom of those long past times,  and perhaps we shall gain too a better view of the state of learning  existing then. But that the reader may judge for himself, I extract the  names of some of the writers whom the monks of Durham preserved and  read:        Alcuin.      Ambrose.      Aratores.      Anselm.      Augustine.      Aviany.      Bede.      Boethius.      Bernard.      Cassian.      Cassiodorus.      Claudius.      Cyprian.      Donatus.      Esop.      Eutropius.      Galen.      Gregory.      Haimo.      Horace.      Homer.      Hugo.      Juvenal.      Isidore.      Josephus.      Lucan.      Marcianus.      Maximian.      Orosius.      Ovid.      Prudentius.      Prosper.      Persius.      Priscian.      Peter Lombard.      Plato.      Pompeius Trogus.      Quintilian.      Rabanus.      Solinus.      Servius.      Statius.      Terence.      Tully.      Theodulus.

I feel a good deal better about it now than I  did this afternoon, when I didn't know how things were likely to go with  you.\"    \"I hope so,\" said Dick. \"But I'm afraid you won't get any supper, if you  stay any longer with me.\"    \"How about your supper, Dick?\" asked Fosdick, with sudden thought. \"Do  they give you any in this establishment?\"    \"No,\" said Dick; \"this hotel's on the European system, with  improvements. You get your lodgin' for nothing, and nothing to eat along  with it. I don't like the system much. I don't think I could stand it  more'n a week without its hurtin' my constitution.\"    \"I'll go out and get you something, Dick,\" said Fosdick, \"if the rules  of the establishment allow it. Shall I?\"    \"Well,\" said Dick, \"I think I might eat a little, though the place isn't  very stimulatin' to the appetite.\"    \"What shall I bring you?\"    \"I aint particular,\" said Dick.    Just then the attendant came along, and Fosdick inquired if he would be  allowed to bring his friend something to eat.    \"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"We provide nothing ourselves, as the  prisoners only stay with us a few hours.\"    \"I'll be right back,\" said Fosdick.    Not far from the station-house, Fosdick found a baker's shop, where he  bought some bread and cakes, with which he started to return. As he was  nearing the station-house, he caught sight of Micky Maguire hovering  about the door. Micky smiled significantly as he saw Fosdick and his  burden.    \"Where are you carryin' that?\" he asked.    \"Why do you ask?\" said Fosdick, who could not feel very friendly to the  author of Dick's misfortune.    \"Never mind why,\" said Micky. \"I know well enough. It's for your friend  Dick. How does he like his new lodgins'?\"    \"How do you like them? You've been there often enough.\"    \"Don't be impudent, or I'll lam' ye,\" said Micky, scowling.    As Fosdick was considerably smaller than himself, Micky might have  ventured upon an assault, but deemed it imprudent in the immediate  vicinity of the station-house.    \"Give my compliments to Dick,\" he said. \"I hope he'll sleep well.\"    To this Fosdick returned no answer, but, entering the building,  descended to Dick's temporary quarters. He passed the bread and cake  through the grating, and Dick, cheered by the hope of an acquittal on  the morrow, and a speedy recovery of his freedom, partook with a good  appetite.    \"Can't you give me a mouthful, boss?\" muttered the negro woman before  mentioned, as she caught sight of Fosdick's load.    He passed a cake through the grating, which she seized eagerly, and  devoured with appetite.    \"I think I must be going,\" said Mr. Murdock, consulting his watch, \"or  my wife and children won't know what has become of me.\"    \"Good-night, Mr. Murdock,\" said Dick. \"Thank you for your kindness.\"    \"Good-night, Richard. Keep up your courage.\"    \"I'll try to.\"    Fosdick stopped longer. At last he went away, and our hero, left to  himself, lay down upon his pallet and tried to get to sleep.          CHAPTER XVI.    ROSWELL CRAWFORD RETIRES FROM BUSINESS.      \"Can you send this home for me?\" asked a lady in Hall & Turner's store  about three o'clock in the afternoon of the day on which Dick, as we  have related, was arrested.    \"Certainly, madam. Where shall it be sent?\" asked the clerk.    \"No. 47 West Fortieth Street,\" was the reply.    \"Very well, it shall be sent up immediately. Here, Roswell.\"    Roswell Crawford came forward not very willingly. He had no great liking  for the task which he saw would be required of him. Fortieth Street was  at least a mile and a half distant, and he had already just returned  from a walk in a different direction. Besides, the bundle was a large  one, containing three dress patterns. He did not think it very suitable  for a gentleman's son to be seen carrying such a large bundle through  the streets.    \"Why don't you send Edward?\" he said, complainingly. \"He doesn't do half  as much as I.\"    \"I shall send whom I please,\" said the clerk, sharply. \"You wouldn't do  anything if you could help it.\"    \"I won't carry bundles much longer,\" said Roswell. \"You put all the  heaviest bundles off upon me.\"    Roswell's back being turned, he did not observe Mr. Turner, who had come  up as he was speaking.    \"What are you complaining about?\" asked that gentleman.    Roswell turned, and colored a little when he saw his employer.    \"What is the matter?\" repeated Mr. Turner.    \"Mr. Evans always gives me the largest bundles to carry,\" said Roswell.    \"He is always complaining of having to carry bundles,\" said the clerk.  \"He says it isn't suitable work for a gentleman's son.\"    \"I have noticed it,\" said Mr. Turner. \"On the whole, I think, Mr.  Crawford,\" he said, with mock deference, \"I think you have mistaken your  vocation in entering a dry-goods store. I advise you to seek some more  gentlemanly employment. At the end of the week, you are at liberty to  leave my employment for one better suited to you.\"    \"I'm ready to go now,\" said Roswell, sulkily.    \"Very well; if you desire it, I will not insist upon your remaining. If  you will come up to the desk, you shall receive what is due you.\"    It was somewhat humiliating to Roswell to feel that his services were so  readily dispensed with. Still he had never liked the place, and heartily  disliked carrying bundles. By going at once, he would get rid of the  large bundle to be carried to West Fortieth Street. Congratulating  himself, therefore, on the whole, on escaping from what he regarded as a  degrading servitude, he walked up to the desk in a dignified manner, and  received the wages due him.    \"I hope you will find some more congenial employment,\" said Mr. Turner,  who paid him the amount of his wages.    \"I have no doubt I shall,\" said Roswell, loftily. \"My father was a  gentleman, and our family has considerable influence.\"    \"Well, I wish you success. Good-by.\"    \"Good-by,\" said Roswell, and walked out of the shop with head erect.    He did not quite like going home at once, as explanation would be rather  awkward under the circumstances. He accordingly crossed over to Fifth  Avenue, considering that the most suitable promenade for a gentleman's  son. He could not help regarding with some envy the happy possessors of  the elegant buildings which he passed. Why had partial Fate denied him  that fortune which would have enabled him to live in this favored  locality?    \"Plenty of snobs have got money,\" he thought. \"How much better I could  use it than they! I wish I were rich! You wouldn't catch me slaving my  life out in a dry-goods store, or any other.\"    This was undoubtedly true. Work of any kind had no charms for Roswell.  To walk up the avenue swinging a dandy cane, dressed in the height of  the fashion, or, what was better yet, sitting back luxuriously in an  elegant carriage drawn by a dashing span; such was what he regarded  himself most fit for. But, unfortunately, he was not very likely to  realize his wishes. The desire to enjoy wealth doesn't bring it, and the  tastes of a gentleman are not a very good stock to begin life with. So  Roswell sauntered along in rather a discontented frame of mind until he  reached Madison Park, where he sat down on a bench, and listlessly  watched some boys who were playing there.    \"Hallo, Roswell!\" said one of his acquaintances, coming up by chance.  \"How do you happen to be here?\"    \"Why shouldn't I be here?\"    \"I thought you were in a store somewhere on Sixth Avenue.\"    \"Well, I was, but I have left it.\"    \"When did you leave it?\"    \"To-day.\"    \"Got sacked, hey?\"    \"Sacked,\" in the New York vernacular, means discharged from a place. The  idea of having it supposed that he had been \"sacked\" was not pleasing to  Roswell's pride. He accordingly answered, \"I never was 'sacked' in my  life. Besides, it's a low word, and I never use it.\"    \"Well, you know what I mean. Did they turn you off?\"    \"No, they didn't. They would have been glad to have me stay.\"    \"Why didn't you then?\"    \"I didn't like the business.\"    \"Dry goods,--wasn't it?\"    \"Yes, a retail dry-goods store. If I ever go into that line again, it'll  be in a wholesale store. There's a chance there for a man to rise.\"    \"You don't call yourself a man yet,--do you?\"    \"I call myself a gentleman,\" said Roswell, shortly.    \"What are you going to do now?\"    \"I'm in no hurry about a new place. I shall look round a little.\"    \"Well, success to you. I must be getting back to the shop.\"    \"What are you doing?\"    \"I'm learning a trade.\"    \"Oh!\" said Roswell, turning up his nose slightly, which was quite easy  for him to do, as nature had given that organ an upward turn. He thought  all trades low, and resolved hereafter to hold as little communication  as possible with the boy who had so far demeaned himself as to be  learning one. That was worse than being in a dry-goods store, and  carrying around bundles.    Towards six o'clock Roswell rose from his seat, and sauntered towards  Clinton Place, which was nearly a mile distant. He entered the house a  little before dinner.    \"Are you not earlier than usual, Roswell?\" asked his mother.    \"I've left the store,\" he said, abruptly.    \"Left the store!\" echoed his mother, in some dismay. \"Why?\"    \"Because they don't know how to treat me. It's no fit place for a  gentleman's son.\"    \"I am sorry, Roswell,\" said Mrs. Crawford, who, like her son, was \"poor  and proud,\" and found the four dollars he earned weekly of advantage.  \"I'm afraid you have been foolish.\"    \"Listen, mother, and I'll tell you all about it,\" he said.    Roswell gave his explanation, which, it need hardly be said, was very  favorable to himself, and Mrs. Crawford was finally brought to believe  that Hall & Turner were low people, with whom it was not suitable for  one of her son's gentlemanly tastes to be placed. His vindication was  scarcely over, when the bell rang, and his Cousin Gilbert was"]]]
