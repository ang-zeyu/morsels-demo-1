He was  very angry, and began to beat the servant, when a friend sent him a  present of game. Upon this the servant exclaimed: \"O my lord! you saw  only one crow, and have received a fine present; had you seen _two_, you  would have met with _my_ fare.\"[38]       [38] This last jest reappears in the apocryphal Life of Esop,          by Planudes, the only difference being that Esop's          master is invited to a feast, instead of receiving a          present of game, upon which Esop exclaims: \"Alas! I see          two crows, and I am beaten; you see one, and are asked          to a feast. What a delusion is augury!\"    It would seem, from the following story, that an old man's prayers are  sometimes reversed in response, as dreams are said to \"go by  contraries\": An old Arab left his house one morning, intending to go to  a village at some distance, and coming to the foot of a hill which he  had to cross he exclaimed: \"O Allah! send some one to help me over this  hill.\" Scarcely had he uttered these words when up came a fierce  soldier, leading a mare with a very young colt by her side, who  compelled the old man, with oaths and threats, to carry the colt. As  they trudged along, they met a poor woman with a sick child in her arms.  The old man, as he laboured under the weight of the colt, kept groaning,  \"O Allah! O Allah!\" and, supposing him to be a dervish, the woman asked  him to pray for the recovery of her child. In compliance, the old man  said: \"O Allah! I beseech thee to shorten the days of this poor child.\"  \"Alas!\" cried the mother, \"why hast thou made such a cruel prayer?\"  \"Fear nothing,\" said the old man; \"thy child will assuredly enjoy long  life. It is my fate to have the reverse of whatever I pray for. I  implored Allah for assistance to carry me over this hill, and, by way of  help, I suppose, I have had this colt imposed on my shoulders.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jami tells this humorous story in the Sixth \"Garden\" of his  _Baharistan_, or Abode of Spring: A man said the prescribed prayers in a  mosque and then began his personal supplications. An old woman, who  happened to be near him, exclaimed: \"O Allah! cause me to share in  whatsoever he supplicates for.\" The man, overhearing her, then prayed:  \"O Allah! hang me on a gibbet, and cause me to die of scourging.\" The  old trot continued: \"O Allah! pardon me, and preserve me from what he  has asked for.\" Upon this the man turned to her and said: \"What a very  unreasonable partner this is! She desires to share in all that gives  rest and pleasure, but she refuses to be my partner in distress and  misery.\"           *       *       *       *       *    We have already seen that even the grave and otiose Turk is not devoid  of a sense of the ludicrous, and here is another example, from Mr.  E. J. W. Gibb's translation of the _History of the Forty Vezirs_: A party  of Turkmans left their encampment one day and went into a neighbouring  city. Returning home, as they drew near their tents, they felt hungry,  and sat down and ate some bread and onions at a spring-head. The juice  of the onions went into their eyes and caused them to water. Now the  children of those Turkmans had gone out to meet them, and, seeing the  tears flow from their eyes, they concluded that one of their number had  died in the city, so, without making any inquiry, they ran back, and  said to their mothers: \"One of ours is dead in the city, and our fathers  are coming weeping.\" Upon this all the women and children of the  encampment went forth to meet them, weeping together. The Turkmans who  were coming from the city thought that one of theirs had died in the  encampment; and thus they were without knowledge one of the other, and  they raised a weeping and wailing together such that it cannot be  described. At length the elders of the camp stood up in their midst and  said: \"May ye all remain whole; there is none other help than patience\";  and they questioned them. The Turkmans coming from the city asked: \"Who  is dead in the camp?\" The others replied: \"No one is dead in the camp;  who has died in the city?\" Those who were coming from the city, said:  \"No one has died in the city.\" The others said: \"For whom then are ye  wailing and lamenting?\" At length they perceived that all this tumult  arose from their trusting the words of children.    This last belongs rather to the class of simpleton-stories; and in the  following, from the Rev. J. Hinton Knowles' _Folk Tales of Kashmir_  (Truebner: 1888), we have a variant of the well-known tale of the twelve  men of Gotham who went one day to fish, and, before returning home,  miscounted their number, of which several analogues are given in my  _Book of Noodles_, pp. 28 ff. (Elliot Stock: 1888): Ten peasants were  standing on the side of the road weeping. They thought that one of their  number had been lost on the way, as each man had counted the company,  and found them nine only. \"Ho! you--what's the matter?\" shouted a  townsman passing by. \"O sir,\" said the peasants, \"we were ten men when  we left the village, but now we are only nine.\" The townsman saw at a  glance what fools they were: each of them had omitted to count himself  in the number. He therefore told them to take off their _topis_  (skull-caps) and place them on the ground. This they did, and counted  ten of them, whereupon they concluded they were all there, and were  comforted. But they could not tell how it was.           *       *       *       *       *    That wakefulness is not necessarily watchfulness may seem paradoxical,  yet here is a Persian story which goes far to show that they are not  always synonymous terms: Once upon a time (to commence in the good old  way) there came into a city a merchant on horseback, attended by his  servant on foot. Hearing that the city was infested by many bold and  expert thieves, in consequence of which property was very insecure, he  said to his servant at night: \"I will keep watch, and do you sleep; for  I cannot trust you to keep awake, and I much fear that my horse may be  stolen.\" But to this arrangement his faithful servant would not consent,  and he insisted upon watching all night. So the master went to sleep,  and three hours after awoke, when he called to his servant: \"What are  you doing?\" He answered: \"I am meditating how Allah has spread the earth  upon the water.\" The master said: \"I am afraid lest thieves come, and  you know nothing of it.\" \"O my lord, be satisfied; I am on the watch.\"  The merchant again went to sleep, and awaking about midnight cried: \"Ho!  what are you doing?\" The servant replied: \"I am considering how Allah  has supported the sky without pillars.\" Quoth the master: \"But I am  afraid that while you are busy meditating thieves will carry off my  horse.\" \"Be not afraid, master, I am fully awake; how, then, can thieves  come?\" The master replied: \"If you wish to sleep, I will keep watch.\"  But the servant would not hear of this; he was not at all sleepy; so his  master addressed himself once more to slumber; and when one hour of the  night yet remained he awoke, and as usual asked him what he was doing,  to which he coolly answered: \"I am considering, since the thieves have  stolen the horse, whether I shall carry the saddle on my head, or you,  sir.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Somewhat akin to the familiar \"story\" of the man whose eyesight was so  extraordinary that he could, standing in the street, perceive a fly on  the dome of St. Paul's is the tale of the Three Dervishes who,  travelling in company, came to the sea-shore of Syria, and desired the  captain of a vessel about to sail for Cyprus to give them a passage. The  captain was willing to take them \"for a consideration\"; but they told  him they were dervishes, and therefore without money, but they possessed  certain wonderful gifts, which might be of use to him on the voyage. The  first dervish said that he could descry any object at the distance of a  year's journey; the second could hear at as great a distance as his  brother could see. \"Well!\" exclaimed the captain, \"these are truly  miraculous gifts; and pray, sir,\" said he, turning to the third dervish,  \"what may _your_ particular gift be?\" \"I, sir,\" replied he, \"am an  unbeliever.\" When the captain heard this, he said he could not take such  a person on board of his ship; but on the others declaring they must all  three go together or remain behind, he at length consented to allow the  third dervish a passage with the two highly-gifted ones. In the course  of the voyage, it happened one fine day that the captain and the three  dervishes were on deck conversing, when suddenly the first dervish  exclaimed: \"Look, look!--see, there--the daughter of the sultan of India  sitting at the window of her palace, working embroidery.\" \"A mischief on  your eyes!\" cried the second dervish, \"for her needle has this moment  dropped from her hand, and I hear it sound upon the pavement below her  window.\" \"Sir,\" said the third dervish, addressing the captain, \"shall  I, or shall I not, be an unbeliever?\" Quoth the captain: \"Come, friend,  come with me into my cabin, and let us cultivate unbelief together!\"           *       *       *       *       *    A very droll parrot story occurs--where, indeed, we should least expect  to meet with such a thing--in the _Masnavi_ of Jelalu-'d-Din er-Rumi  (13th century), a grand mystical poem, or rather series of poems, in six  books, written in Persian rhymed couplets, as the title indicates. In  the second poem of the First Book we read that an oilman possessed a  fine parrot, who amused him with her prattle and watched his shop during  his absence. It chanced one day, when the oilman"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#18)"],[1,"not fight in the way of Allah, and  we have indeed been compelled to abandon our homes and our children.  But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned back, except a few  of them, and Allah knows the unjust.    002.247  Y: Their Prophet said to them: \"Allah hath appointed Talut as king over  you.\" They said: \"How can he exercise authority over us when we are  better fitted than he to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted,  with wealth in abundance?\" He said: \"Allah hath Chosen him above you,  and hath gifted him abundantly with knowledge and bodily prowess: Allah  Granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth. Allah careth for all, and  He knoweth all things.\"    P: Their Prophet said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up Saul to be a  king for you. They said: How can he have kingdom over us when we are  more deserving of the kingdom than he is, since he hath not been given  wealth enough? He said: Lo! Allah hath chosen him above you, and hath  increased him abundantly in wisdom and stature. Allah bestoweth His  Sovereignty on whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.    S: And their prophet said to them: Surely Allah has raised Talut to be a  king over you. They said: How can he hold kingship over us while we  have a greater right to kingship than he, and he has not been granted  an abundance of wealth? He said: Surely Allah has chosen him in  preference to you, and He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and  physique, and Allah grants His kingdom to whom He pleases, and Allah is  Amplegiving, Knowing.    002.248  Y: And (further) their Prophet said to them: \"A Sign of his authority is  that there shall come to you the Ark of the covenant, with (an  assurance) therein of security from your Lord, and the relics left by  the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this  is a symbol for you if ye indeed have faith.\"    P: And their Prophet said unto them: Lo! the token of his kingdom is  that there shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance  from your Lord, and a remnant of that which the house of Moses and the  house of Aaron left behind, the angels bearing it. Lo! herein shall be  a token for you if (in truth) ye are believers.    S: And the prophet said to them: Surely the sign of His kingdom is, that  there shall come to you the chest in which there is tranquillity from  your Lord and residue of the relics of what the children of Musa and  the children of Haroun have left, the angels bearing it; most surely  there is a sign in this for those who believe.    002.249  Y: When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: \"Allah will test you  at the stream: if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army:  Only those who taste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand  is excused.\" but they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed  the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said: \"This day We  cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.\" but those who were convinced  that they must meet Allah, said: \"How oft, by Allah's will, Hath a  small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly  persevere.\"    P: And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you  by (the ordeal of) a river. Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is  not of me, and whosoever tasteth it not he is of me, save him who  taketh (thereof) in the hollow of his hand. But they drank thereof, all  save a few of them. And after he had crossed (the river), he and those  who believed with him, they said: We have no power this day against  Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew that they would meet Allah  exclaimed: How many a little company hath overcome a mighty host by  Allah's leave! Allah is with the steadfast.    S: So when Talut departed with the forces, he said: Surely Allah will  try you with a river; whoever then drinks from it, he is not of me, and  whoever does not taste of it, he is surely of me, except he who takes  with his hand as much of it as fills the hand; but with the exception  of a few of them they drank from it. So when he had crossed it, he and  those who believed with him, they said: We have today no power against  Jalut and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet their  Lord said: How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by  Allah's permission, and Allah is with the patient.    002.250  Y: When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they prayed:  \"Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm: Help us  against those that reject faith.\"    P: And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they  said: Our Lord! Bestow on us endurance, make our foothold sure, and  give us help against the disbelieving folk.    S: And when they went out against Jalut and his forces they said: Our  Lord, pour down upon us patience, and make our steps firm and assist us  against the unbelieving people.    002.251  Y: By Allah's will they routed them; and David slew Goliath; and Allah  gave him power and wisdom and taught him whatever (else) He willed. And  did not Allah Check one set of people by means of another, the earth  would indeed be full of mischief: But Allah is full of bounty to all  the worlds.    P: So they routed them by Allah's leave and David slew Goliath; and  Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of that which He  willeth. And if Allah had not repelled some men by others the earth  would have been corrupted. But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to (His)  creatures.    S: So they put them to flight by Allah's permission. And Dawood slew  Jalut, and Allah gave him kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of what He  pleased. And were it not for Allah's repelling some men with others,  the earth would certainly be in a state of disorder; but Allah is  Gracious to the creatures.    002.252  Y: These are the Signs of Allah: we rehearse them to thee in truth:  verily Thou art one of the messengers.    P: These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee (Muhammad)  with truth, and lo! thou art of the number of (Our) messengers;    S: These are the communications of Allah: We recite them to you with  truth; and most surely you are (one) of the messengers.    002.253  Y: Those messengers We endowed with gifts, some above others: To one of  them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honour); to Jesus the  son of Mary We gave clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the holy  spirit. If Allah had so willed, succeeding generations would not have  fought among each other, after clear (Signs) had come to them, but they  (chose) to wrangle, some believing and others rejecting. If Allah had  so willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah Fulfilleth  His plan.    P: Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and  of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them He  exalted (above others) in degree; and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear  proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty) and We supported him with the holy  Spirit. And if Allah had so wiled it, those who followed after them  would not have fought one with another after the clear proofs had come  unto them. But they differed, some of them believing and some  disbelieving. And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought  one with another; but Allah doeth what He will.    S: We have made some of these messengers to excel the others among them  are they to whom Allah spoke, and some of them He exalted by (many  degrees of) rank; and We gave clear miracles to Isa son of Marium, and  strengthened him with the holy spirit. And if Allah had pleased, those  after them would not have fought one with another after clear arguments  had come to them, but they disagreed; so there were some of them who  believed and others who denied; and if Allah had pleased they would not  have fought one with another, but Allah brings about what He intends.    002.254  Y: O ye who believe! Spend out of (the bounties) We have provided for  you, before the Day comes when no bargaining (Will avail), nor  friendship nor intercession. Those who reject Faith they are the  wrong-doers.    P: O ye who believe! Spend of that wherewith We have provided you ere a  day come when there will be no trafficking, nor friendship, nor  intercession. The disbelievers, they are the wrong-doers.    S: O you who believe! spend out of what We have given you before the day  comes in which there is no bargaining, neither any friendship nor  intercession, and the unbelievers-- they are the unjust.    002.255  Y: Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-subsisting,  Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the  heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except  as He permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures as)  before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His  knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens  and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving  them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).    P: Allah! There is no deity save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither  slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in  the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth  with Him save by His leave? He knoweth that which is in front of them  and that which is behind them, while they encompass nothing of His  knowledge save what He will. His throne includeth the heavens and the  earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the  Tremendous.    S: Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving, the  Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor  sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His;  who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission? He knows  what is before them and what is behind them, and they"]]]
