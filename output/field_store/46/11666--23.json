It was a hard and  doubtful warfare that the Puritans were waging against spiritual  wickedness in high places; the defection of the Separatists doubly  weakened them in the conflict. It is not strange, however it may seem  so, that the animosity of Puritan toward Separatist was sometimes  acrimonious, nor that the public reproaches hurled at the unpopular  little party should have provoked recriminations upon the assailants as  being involved in the defilements and the plagues of Babylon, and should  have driven the Separatists into a narrower exclusiveness of separation,  cutting themselves off not only from communion with abuses and  corruptions in the Church of England, but even from fellowship with good  and holy men in the national church who did not find it a duty to  secede.    Nothing of this bitterness and narrowness is found in Robinson.  Strenuously as he maintained the right and duty of separation from the  Establishment, he was, especially in his later years, no less earnest in  condemning the \"Separatists who carried their separation too far and had  gone beyond the true landmarks in matters of Christian doctrine or of  Christian fellowship.\"[85:1] His latest work, \"found in his studie after  his decease,\" was \"A Treatise of the Lawfulness of Hearing of the  Ministers in the Church of England.\"    The moderateness of Robinson's position, and the brotherly kindness of  his temper, could not save him and his people from the prevailing odium  that rested upon the Separatist. Many and grave were the sorrows through  which the Pilgrim church had to pass in its way from the little hamlet  of Scrooby to the bleak hill of Plymouth. They were in peril from the  persecutor at home and in peril in the attempt to escape; in peril from  greedy speculators and malignant politicians; in peril from the sea and  from cold and from starvation; in peril from the savages and from false  brethren privily sent among them to spy out their liberties; but an  added bitterness to all their tribulations lay in this, that, for the  course which they were constrained in conscience to pursue, they were  subject to the reprobation of those whom they most highly honored as  their brethren in the faith of Christ. Some of the most heartbreaking of  their trials arose directly from the unwillingness of English Puritans  to sustain, or even countenance, the Pilgrim colony.    In the year 1607, when the ships of the Virginia Company were about  landing their freight of emigrants and supplies at Jamestown, the first  and unsuccessful attempt of the Pilgrims was made to escape from their  native land to Holland. Before the end of 1608 the greater part of them,  in scattering parties, had effected the passage of the North Sea, and  the church was reunited in a land of religious freedom. With what a  blameless, diligent, and peaceful life they adorned the name of disciple  through all the twelve years of their sojourn, how honored and beloved  they were among the churches and in the University of Leyden, there are  abundant testimonies. The twelve years of seclusion in an alien land  among a people of strange language was not too long a discipline of  preparation for that work for which the Head of the church had set them  apart. This was the period of Robinson's activity as author. In erudite  studies, in grave debate with gainsayers at home and with fellow-exiles  in Holland, he was maturing in his own mind, and in the minds of the  church, those large and liberal yet definite views of church  organization and duty which were destined for coming ages so profoundly  to influence the American church in all its orders and divisions. \"He  became a reformer of the Separation.\"[87:1]    We pass by the heroic and pathetic story of the consultations and  correspondences, the negotiations and disappointments, the embarkation  and voyage, and come to that memorable date, November 11 (= 21), 1620,  when, arrived off the shore of Cape Cod, the little company, without  charter or warrant of any kind from any government on earth, about to  land on a savage continent in quest of a home, gathered in the cabin of  the \"Mayflower,\" and after a method quite in analogy with that in which,  sixteen years before, they had constituted the church at Scrooby,  entered into formal and solemn compact \"in the presence of God and one  of another, covenanting and combining themselves together into a civil  body politic.\"    It is difficult, in reading the instrument then subscribed, to avoid the  conviction that the theory of the origin of the powers of civil  government in a social compact, which had long floated in literature  before it came to be distinctly articulated in the \"Contrat Social\" of  Jean Jacques Rousseau, was familiar to the minds of those by whom the  paper was drawn. Thoughtful men at the present day universally recognize  the fallacy of this plausible hypothesis, which once had such wide  currency and so serious an influence on the course of political history  in America. But whether or not they were affected by the theory, the  practical good sense of the men and their deference to the teachings of  the Bible secured them from the vicious and absurd consequences  deducible from it. Not all the names of the colonists were subscribed to  the compact,--a clear indication of the freedom of individual judgment  in that company,--but it was never for a moment held that the  dissentients were any the less bound by it. When worthless John  Billington, who had somehow got \"shuffled into their company,\" was  sentenced for disrespect and disobedience to Captain Myles Standish \"to  have his neck and heels tied together,\" it does not seem to have  occurred to him to plead that he had never entered into the social  compact; nor yet when the same wretched man, ten years later, was by a  jury convicted of willful murder, and sentenced to death and executed.  Logically, under the social-compact theory, it would have been competent  for those dissenting from this compact to enter into another, and set up  a competing civil government on the same ground; but what would have  been the practical value of this line of argument might have been  learned from Mr. Thomas Morton, of Furnivall's Inn, after he had been  haled out of his disorderly house at Merry Mount by Captain Standish,  and convented before the authorities at Plymouth.    The social-compact theory as applied to the church, implying that the  mutual duties of Christian disciples in society are derived solely from  mutual stipulations, is quite as transparently fallacious as when it is  applied to civil polity, and the consequences deducible from it are not  less absurd. But it cannot be claimed for the Plymouth men, and still  less for their spiritual successors, that they have wholly escaped the  evil consequences of their theory in its practical applications. The  notion that a church of Christ is a club, having no authority or  limitations but what it derives from club rules agreed on among the  members, would have been scouted by the Pilgrims; among those who now  claim to sit in their seats there are some who would hesitate to admit  it, and many who would frankly avow it with all its mischievous  implications. Planted in the soil of Plymouth, it spread at once through  New England, and has become widely rooted in distant and diverse  regions of the American church.[89:1]    The church of Plymouth, though deprived of its pastor, continued to be  rich in faith and in all spiritual gifts, and most of all in the  excellent gift of charity. The history of it year after year is a  beautiful illustration of brotherly kindness and mutual self-sacrifice  among themselves and of forgiving patience toward enemies. But the  colony, beginning in extreme feebleness and penury, never became either  strong or rich. One hundred and two souls embarked in the \"Mayflower,\"  of whom nearly one half were dead before the end of four months. At the  end of four years the number had increased to one hundred and eighty. At  the end of ten years the settlement numbered three hundred persons.    It could not have been with joy wholly unalloyed with misgivings that  this feeble folk learned of a powerful movement for planting a Puritan  colony close in the neighborhood. The movement had begun in the heart of  the national church, and represented everything that was best in that  institution. The Rev. John White, rector of Dorchester, followed across  the sea with pastoral solicitude the young men of his parish, who, in  the business of the fisheries, were wont to make long stay on the New  England coast, far from home and church. His thought was to establish a  settlement that should be a sort of depot of supplies for the fishing  fleets, and a temporary home attended with the comforts and safeguards  of Christian influence. The project was a costly failure; but it was  like the corn of wheat falling into the ground to die, and bringing  forth much fruit. A gentleman of energy and dignity, John Endicott,  pledged his personal service as leader of a new colony. In September,  1628, he landed with a pioneering party at Naumkeag, and having happily  composed some differences that arose with the earlier comers, they named  the place _Salem_, which is, by interpretation, \"Peace.\" Already, with  the newcomers and the old, the well-provided settlement numbered more  than fifty persons, busy in preparation for further arrivals. Meanwhile  vigorous work was doing in England. The organization to sustain the  colony represented adequate capital and the highest quality of character  and influence. A royal charter, drawn with sagacious care to secure  every privilege the Puritan Company desired, was secured from the  fatuity of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20194"],[0,"The Petticoat Commando: Boer Women in Secret Service (#18)"],[1,"bitter inclemency of the South African winters and the  scorching, germ-breeding heat of the summer, succumbed in their  thousands, while daily, fresh people, ruddy, healthy, straight from  their wholesome life on the farms, were brought into the infected  camps and left to face sickness and the imminent risk of death.    Over twenty thousand dead women and children stand recorded in the  books of the Burgher Camps Department to-day, as the victims of this  policy of concentration.    Over twenty thousand women and children within two years! While the  total number of fighting men lost on the Boer side, in battle and in  captivity, amounts to four thousand throughout the entire war.    That this appalling result was wholly unlooked for, we do not doubt,  but nothing could be done to prevent the high mortality until many  months after the worst period was over and only the strongest remained  in the camps. It was indeed a case of the survival of the fittest.    Let me briefly relate a tragic event of the war to show what the  people of the camps went through and what little cause for surprise  there is in the unprecedented death-rate.    During the winter of 1901 a blizzard passed over the High Veld, the  site of so many Concentration Camps, in the Balmoral district, and  overtook a young lieutenant, W. St. Clare McLaren, of the First Argyll  and Sutherland Highlanders (the friend and playmate of Hansie's  childhood's years at Heidelberg) with his men.    They were without shelter, their commissariat waggons being some way  ahead, and crept under a tarpaulin for protection from the fierce and  bitterly cold blast.    During that awful night Mr. McLaren took off his overcoat to cover up  the perishing body of his major, and when morning came he was found  dead with five of his men, while around them, stiffly frozen, lay the  bodies of six hundred mules.    The brave and heroic heart was stilled for ever, a young and noble  life was lost in performing an act of rare self-sacrifice; but far  away in \"bonnie Scotland\" a widowed mother, smiling bravely through  her tears, thanked God for the privilege of cherishing _such_ a  memory.    Small wonder to us then, when tragedies such as this were brought home  to us, that in the camps the thin tents, torn to ribbons by the  storm, afforded no protection to the scantily-clothed, half-famished  inmates!    That the death-rate was not higher during the winter months we owe  entirely to the overcrowding of the tents, there being in Hansie's  ward at Irene many bell-tents, destined to accommodate six, holding  from sixteen to twenty-three persons for many months. But what was an  advantage during the winter months became a source of great danger  when the heat of summer came.    To return to our story.    It was Hansie's privilege--yes, privilege--to act as one of the  volunteer nurses from Pretoria during that very winter of 1901, and  though it is not my intention to record in this book the experience  connected with that period, I do not think it will be out of place  here to mention an important result of that sojourn at Irene.    Mrs. van Warmelo visited her daughter in the camp for the first time  on May 21st, and she was so much impressed by the misery she had  witnessed that, on her return to Pretoria that night, she could not  sleep, but tossed from side to side, thinking of some way to save her  country-women from suffering and death.    Suddenly she was inspired by the thought, \"Write a petition to the  Consuls!\"    It was 3 a.m. when she got out of bed to fetch her writing-materials  from the dining-room, and she then and there wrote a passionate appeal  for help to the Diplomatic Corps in Pretoria.    The Consul-General for the Netherlands, Mr. Domela Nieuwenhuis, to  whom she took the petition the following morning, advised her to lay  it before the Portuguese Consul, Mr. Cinatti, who, as the doyen of the  Diplomatic Corps, would bring the matter before the other Consuls, if  he thought it advisable.    Mr. Cinatti, after reading the petition, said the matter could  certainly be taken up if Mrs. van Warmelo would get a few leading  women in Pretoria to sign the petition.    This was done within a few days.    Under injunctions to observe the strictest secrecy, nine prominent  Boer women signed the document, and it was once more laid before the  senior member of the Diplomatic Corps, who immediately called a  meeting of the Consuls, the result of which was that a copy of the  petition, translated into French, was sent by the first mail to each  of the ten different Powers they represented and also to Lord  Kitchener.    General Maxwell, soon after these were dispatched, asked Mr. Cinatti  to see him at once in his office at Government Buildings, where, in a  long interview with him, he demanded from Mr. Cinatti the names of the  nine signatories.    Mr. Cinatti said he was not at liberty to disclose them--that, in  fact, they were not known (with the exception of the writer of the  petition) to the other Consuls. General Maxwell then pressed him to  give him that name only, as he particularly wished to know who had  drawn up the petition.    This was refused, fortunately for Mrs. van Warmelo, for the penalty  would have been great.    The military authorities left no stone unturned afterwards to find out  who the women petitioners were, but without success, thanks to the  great precautions taken by the Portuguese Consul.    A full month passed and no reply came from Lord Kitchener.    A second petition, more strongly worded than the first, was then drawn  up, imploring the Consuls to intercede on behalf of the victims of the  Concentration Camps and to inform the Powers represented by them, of  the death-rate which threatened the Boer nation with extinction.    Again a meeting of the Consuls was called, at which three of them were  appointed to form a committee of investigation:      Consul Cinatti, Consul-General for Portugal.    Baron Pitner, Consul-General for Austria.    Baron Ostmann, Consul-General for Germany.    Some of the other members at the meeting were:      M. Domela Nieuwenhuis, Consul-General for the Netherlands.    M. Aubert, Consul-General for France.    Mr. Gordon, Consul-General for United States.    The latter lived in Johannesburg, but attended all the meetings held  in Pretoria in connection with the Concentration Camps.    From General Maxwell the committee of investigation got permission to  inspect the Camp at Irene, called the \"Model Camp,\" and with the  statistics obtained there, as well as the official statistics of all  the camps in the Transvaal, the Diplomatic Corps drew up a report,  which went to prove that unless immediate steps were taken to arrest  the appalling death-rate, the Boer population in the camps would be  extinct within a period of three years.    Copies of this report were sent to the Military Governor and Lord  Kitchener, and to ten foreign Powers, with copies of the second  petition.    What diplomatic correspondence then passed between England and the  foreign Powers we shall never know, for the utmost secrecy was  observed throughout; but what we do know is, that the famous  commission of inquiry, the \"Whitewash Committee,\" so-called by the  Pro-Boers in England, was very soon afterwards sent out. It consisted  of six English ladies, and as a result of their investigations some of  the inland camps were removed to the coast, the rations increased,  additional medical and other comforts provided, and the general  condition of the camps improved to such an extent that after some  months the death-rate decreased considerably, continuing to do so  until it became nearly normal. But, as I have said before, not until  over 20,000 women and children had been sacrificed as a direct result  of being torn from their homes, exposed to the elements, and herded  together under conditions which only the strongest could survive. It  would take too much space to insert copies of the petitions here, but  they are to be found in Hansie's Dutch book on the Irene Concentration  Camp, published in Holland from her diary a year after the war.    The following statistics of what is known as \"Black October 1901\" are  taken from the Blue Books of England and will give the reader an idea  of the number of camps in the Transvaal alone, the number of their  inhabitants, and the full death-rate within the period of thirty-one  days:--    TOTAL CENSUS OF DEATHS, ETC.
