At last a ball came rather farther than usual. Edgar stepped out to meet  it, and drove it nearly straight forward and scored four, and it was not  until his score ran up to thirty that he was at last caught.    \"You will do, Smith,\" Captain Moffat said approvingly. \"Where did you  learn to play cricket?\"    \"I learned at school, sir.\"    \"Ah! well, they taught you that well if they taught you nothing else.  You go on practising, and I will give you a chance to play for the  regiment the first time that there is a vacancy.\"    Two or three matches were played before the chance came. Then Sergeant  Stokes, the bowler, hurt his hand the day before they were going to play  the Rifle Brigade, which was considered the strongest team in camp.    \"This is an unlucky business, sergeant,\" Captain Moffat said to him as  they were talking over next day's play. \"I thought if we had luck we  might make a good fight with the Rifles. Bowling is never our strongest  point, and now you are out of it we shall make a very poor show. Are  there any of the men outside the eleven who show any bowling talent?\"    The sergeant shook his head.    \"Not one of them, sir. I hoped Corporal Holland would have made a  bowler, but he seems to have gone off rather than come on. No; we must  trust to the bowlers we have got. There are four or five of them who are  not bad, though except yourself, sir, there is nothing, so to speak, to  depend on.\"    \"You cannot depend on me, sergeant; there is no certainty about my  bowling. Sometimes I do pretty fairly, at other times I get hit all over  the field. No; my proper place is wicket-keeping. I should never leave  that if we had two or three bowlers we could depend upon. Well, we must  go in for run making.    \"I do not think that we can do better than put on that young trumpeter  till you can play again. I have watched him several times at practice,  and he always keeps his wickets up well, and hits freely whenever he  gets a chance.\"    \"Very well, sir. I will warn him that he will be wanted to-morrow. There  can be no harm in trying him for once anyhow.\"    There was some little surprise among the men who played cricket at  hearing that Trumpeter Smith was to play in the eleven against the  Rifles, and some little grumbling among those who had hoped to be the  next choice. However, all agreed that he was a very likely youngster.  The Hussars won the toss, and went in first. The bowling of the Rifles  was deadly, and the ten wickets fell for fifty-two runs. Edgar was the  last to go in, and did not receive a single ball, his partner succumbing  to the very first ball bowled after Edgar had gone out to the wicket.  Then the Rifles went in, and the loss of the Hussars' fast bowler soon  made itself felt. Two of the best bats of the Rifles were at the wicket,  and in spite of several changes of bowling, seventy-four runs were  scored without a separation being made. Captain Moffat looked round the  field despairingly. He had tried all the men on whom he had any  dependence. His own bowling had been very severely punished, and he had  retired when thirty runs had been scored and was reluctant to take the  ball again. As he was standing undecided after an over in which twelve  runs had been scored, his eye fell on Edgar as he ran lightly across to  take up his place on the opposite side.    \"Smith!\" Edgar ran up to him. \"Do you bowl at all?\"    \"I have not bowled this season, sir, but I used to bowl pretty fairly.\"    \"Very well, then, take the ball at this end after the next over. I am  going to try Smith at this end,\" he said to the young lieutenant who was  long-stop.    He shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, there is one thing, he cannot make a  worse mess of it than we are making already.\"    When the over was concluded, Edgar took the ball. The year that had  elapsed since he had last played, and the gymnastics and hard exercise,  had strengthened his muscles greatly, and as he tossed the ball from  hand to hand while the field took their places he felt that he was more  master of it than he had been before. He had then been a remarkably fast  bowler for his age, and would have been in the eleven had it not  happened that it already possessed three unusually good bowlers.    The first ball he sent up was a comparatively slow one; he wanted to  try his hand. It was dead on the wicket, and was blocked; then he drew  his breath, and sent the next ball in with all his force. A shout rose  from the Hussars as two of the wickets went flying into the air. Another  player came out, but at the fourth ball of the over his middle stump was  levelled.    \"What do you think of that, Langley?\" Captain Moffat asked the long-stop  as they walked together to the other end. \"We have found a treasure. He  bowls about as fast as any one I have ever seen, and every ball is dead  on the wicket.\"    \"He is first-class,\" the lieutenant, who was an old Etonian, said. \"I  wonder where he learnt to play cricket?\"    The wickets fell fast, and the innings concluded for 98, Edgar taking  seven wickets for twelve runs. Captain Moffat put him in third in the  second innings, and he scored twenty-four before he was caught out, the  total score of the innings amounting to 126. The Rifles had therefore  eighty-one runs to get to win. They only succeeded in making  seventy-six, eight of them being either bowled out by Edgar or caught  off his bowling. After this he took his place regularly in the Hussar  team, and it was generally acknowledged that it was owing to his bowling  that the regiment that season stood at the head of the Aldershot teams.          CHAPTER VI.    EGYPT.      Naturally his prowess at cricket made Trumpeter Smith a popular figure  in the regiment, and even at the officers' mess his name was frequently  mentioned, and many guesses were ventured as to who he was and what  school he came from.    That he was a gentleman by birth nobody doubted. There was nothing  unusual in that, for all the cavalry regiments contain a considerable  number of gentlemen in their ranks; men of this class generally  enlisting in the cavalry in preference to the other arms of the service.  It was, however, unusual for one to enlist at Edgar's age. Many young  men, after having failed to gain a commission by competition, enlist in  hopes of working up to one through the ranks. Another class are the men  who having got into scrapes of one kind or another, run through their  money, and tired out their friends, finally enlist as the only thing  open to them.    The first class are among the steadiest men in the regiment, and  speedily work their way up among the non-commissioned officers. The  second class are, on the other hand, among the wildest and least  reputable men in the ranks. They are good men in a campaign where pluck  and endurance and high spirits are most valuable, but among the worst  and most troublesome when there is little to do and time hangs heavily  on hand.    There were two of the sergeants who had failed in the examination for  commissions, and were hoping some day to obtain them. One had been five  years in the regiment, the other three. Their attention had first been  called to Edgar by his getting a first-class in the examination, which  at once stamped him as having had an education greatly superior to that  of the majority of recruits. His position in the regimental cricket team  further attracted their attention, and they took an opportunity to speak  to him when it happened they were walking together and met Edgar  returning from an afternoon's ramble across the country.    \"Well, Smith, how do you like soldiering?\"    \"I like it very well; I don't think that there is anything to complain  of at all.\"    \"It is better than grinding away at Latin and Greek and mathematics, and  that sort of thing,\" the younger of the two sergeants said with a smile.    \"There are advantages both ways, sergeant.\"    \"So there are, lad. Of the two I like drill better than grinding at  books, worse luck; if I had been fond of books I should not be wearing  these stripes. I asked the band-master if you were learning an  instrument. He said you were not. So I suppose you mean to give up your  trumpet and join the ranks as soon as you get to eighteen?\"    \"Yes. I should not care about being in the band.\"    \"Your cricket is not a bad thing for you,\" the elder of the two men  said. \"It brings you into notice, and will help you to get your stripes  earlier than you otherwise would do; as a man who does his regiment  credit either as a good shot or as a cricketer or in the sports is sure  to attract notice, and to be pushed on if he is steady and a smart  soldier. If you won't mind my giving you a bit of advice, I should say  don't try to push yourself forward. Sometimes young fellows spoil their  chances by doing so. Some of the old non-commissioned officers feel a  bit jealous when they see a youngster likely to make his way up, and you  know they can make it very hot for a fellow if they like. So be careful  not to give them a chance. Even if you are blown up when you do not  deserve it, it is better to hold your tongue than to kick against it.  Cheeking a non-commissioned officer never pays.\"    \"Thank you, sergeant,\" Edgar said quietly; \"I am much obliged to you for  your advice.\"    \"An uncommonly good style of young fellow,\" Sergeant Netherton, who was  the son of a colonel in the army, and had been educated at Harrow, said  to his companion. \"Comes from a good school, I should say. Must have got  into some baddish scrape, or he never would be here at his age.\"    \"It does not quite follow,\" the other replied. \"His father may have died  or burst up somehow, and seeing nothing before him but a place at a  clerk's desk or enlisting he may have taken this alternative; and not a  bad choice either. For, putting aside altogether the chance of getting a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#18)"],[1,"described  as '_Bahna kaisi darhi_' or 'A Bahna's beard.' It may be repeated in  conclusion that much of the ridicule attaching to the Bahnas arises  simply from the fact that they follow what is considered a feminine  occupation, and the remainder because in their ignorance they parody  the rites of Islam. It may seem ill-natured to record the sayings  in which they are lampooned, but the Bahnas cannot read English,  and these have an interest as specimens of popular wit.

The tribe and its offshoots.      _Baiga._ [85]--A primitive Dravidian tribe whose home is on the eastern  Satpura hills in the Mandla, Balaghat and Bilaspur Districts. The  number of the Baigas proper was only 30,000 in 1911. But the Binjhals  or Binjhwars, a fairly numerous caste in the Chhattisgarh Division, and  especially in the Sambalpur District, appear to have been originally  Baigas, though they have dropped the original caste name, become  Hinduised, and now disclaim connection with the parent tribe. A  reason for this may be found in the fact that Sambalpur contains  several Binjhwar zamindars, or large landowners, whose families would  naturally desire a more respectable pedigree than one giving them the  wild Baigas of the Satpuras for their forefathers. And the evolution of  the Binjhwar caste is a similar phenomenon to the constitution of the  Raj-Gonds, the Raj-Korkus, and other aristocratic subdivisions among  the forest tribes, who have been admitted to a respectable position  in the Hindu social community. The Binjhwars, however, have been so  successful as to cut themselves off almost completely from connection  with the original tribe, owing to their adoption of another name. But  in Balaghat and Mandla the Binjhwar subtribe is still recognised as  the most civilised subdivision of the Baigas. The Bhainas, a small  tribe in Bilaspur, are probably another offshoot, Kath-Bhaina being  the name of a subtribe of Baigas in that District, and Rai-Bhaina  in Balaghat, though the Bhainas too no longer admit identity with  the Baigas. A feature common to all three branches is that they have  forgotten their original tongue, and now speak a more or less corrupt  form of the Indo-Aryan vernaculars current around them. Finally,  the term Bhumia or 'Lord of the soil' is used sometimes as the name  of a separate tribe and sometimes as a synonym for Baiga. The fact is  that in the Central Provinces [86] Bhumia is the name of an office,  that of the priest of the village and local deities, which is held  by one of the forest tribes. In the tract where the Baigas live,  they, as the most ancient residents, are usually the priests of the  indigenous gods; but in Jubbulpore the same office is held by another  tribe, the Bharias. The name of the office often attaches itself to  members of the tribe, who consider it as somewhat more respectable  than their own, and it is therefore generally true to say that the  people known as Bhumias in Jubbulpore are really Bharias, but in  Mandla and Bilaspur they are Baigas.    In Mandla there is also found a group called Bharia-Baigas. These  are employed as village priests by Hindus, and worship certain Hindu  deities and not the Gond gods. They may perhaps be members of the  Bharia tribe of Jubbulpore, originally derived from the Bhars, who  have obtained the designation of Baiga, owing to their employment  as village priests. But they now consider themselves a part of the  Baiga tribe and say they came to Mandla from Rewah. In Mandla the  decision of a Baiga on a boundary dispute is almost always considered  as final, and this authority is of a kind that commonly emanates from  recognised priority of residence. [87] There seems reason to suppose  that the Baigas are really a branch of the primitive Bhuiya tribe  of Chota Nagpur, and that they have taken or been given the name of  Baiga, the designation of a village priest, on migration into the  Central Provinces. There is reason to believe that the Baigas were  once dominant in the Chhattisgarh plain and the hills surrounding it  which adjoin Chota Nagpur, the home of the Bhuiyas. The considerations  in favour of this view are given in the article on Bhuiya, to which  reference may be made.        2. Tribal legends.      The Baigas, however, are not without some conceit of themselves,  as the following legend will show. In the beginning, they say, God  created Nanga Baiga and Nangi Baigin, the first of the human race,  and asked them by what calling they would choose to live. They at once  said that they would make their living by felling trees in the jungle,  and permission being accorded, have done so ever since. They had two  sons, one of whom remained a Baiga, while the other became a Gond  and a tiller of the soil. The sons married their own two sisters who  were afterwards born, and while the elder couple are the ancestors  of the Baigas, from the younger are descended the Gonds and all the  remainder of the human race. In another version of the story the  first Baiga cut down two thousand old _sal_ [88] trees in one day,  and God told him to sprinkle a few grains of kutki on the ashes, and  then to retire and sleep for some months, when on his return he would  be able to reap a rich harvest for his children. In this manner the  habit of shifting cultivation is accorded divine sanction. According  to Binjhwar tradition Nanga Baiga and Nangi Baigin dwelt on the  _kajli ban pahar_, which being interpreted is the hill of elephants,  and may well refer to the ranges of Mandla and Bilaspur. It is  stated in the _Ain-i-Akbari_ [89] that the country of Garha-Mandla  abounded in wild elephants, and that the people paid their tribute  in these and gold mohurs. In Mandla the Baigas sometimes hang out  from their houses a bamboo mat fastened to a long pole to represent  a flag which they say once flew from the palace of a Baiga king. It  seems likely that the original home of the tribe may have been the  Chhattisgarh plain and the hill-ranges surrounding it. A number of  estates in these hills are held by landowners of tribes which are  offshoots of the Baigas, as the Bhainas and Binjhwars. The point is  further discussed in the article on Bhuiya. Most of the Baigas speak  a corrupt form of the Chhattisgarhi dialect. When they first came  under the detailed observation of English officers in the middle of  the nineteenth century, the tribe were even more solitary and retired  than at present. Their villages, it is said, were only to be found  in places far removed from all cleared and cultivated country. No  roads or well-defined paths connected them with ordinary lines of  traffic and more thickly inhabited tracts, but perched away in snug  corners in the hills, and hidden by convenient projecting spurs and  dense forests from the country round, they could not be seen except  when nearly approached, and were seldom visited unless by occasional  enterprising Banias and vendors of country liquor. Indeed, without a  Baiga for a guide many of the villages could hardly be discovered,  for nothing but occasional notches on the trees distinguished the  tracks to them from those of the sambhar and other wild animals.        3. Tribal subdivisions.      The following seven subdivisions or subtribes are recognised: Binjhwar,  Bharotia, Narotia or Nahar, Raibhaina, Kathbhaina, Kondwan or Kundi,  and Gondwaina. Of these the Binjhwar, Bharotia and Narotia are the  best-known. The name of the Binjhwars is probably derived from the  Vindhyan range, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit _vindhya_,  a hunter. The rule of exogamy is by no means strictly observed,  and in Kawardha it is said that these three subcastes intermarry  though they do not eat together, while in Balaghat the Bharotias  and Narotias both eat together and intermarry. In both places the  Binjhwars occupy the highest position, and the other two subtribes  will take food from them. The Binjhwars consider themselves as Hindus  and abjure the consumption of buffalo's and cow's flesh and rats,  while the other Baigas will eat almost anything. The Bharotias  partially shave their heads, and in Mandla are apparently known as  Mundia or Mudia, or \"shaven.\" The Gondwainas eat both cow's flesh  and monkeys, and are regarded as the lowest subcaste. As shown by  their name they are probably the offspring of unions between Baigas  and Gonds. Similarly the Kondwans apparently derive their name from  the tract south of the Mahanadi which is named after the Khond tribe,  and was formerly owned by them.    Each subtribe is divided into a number of exogamous septs, the names of  which are identical in many cases with those of the Gonds, as Markam,  Maravi, Netam, Tekam and others. Gond names are found most frequently  among the Gondwainas and Narotias, and these have adopted from the  Gonds the prohibition of marriage between worshippers of the same  number of gods. Thus the four septs above mentioned worship seven gods  and may not intermarry. But they may marry among other septs such as  the Dhurua, Pusam, Bania and Mawar who worship six gods. The Baigas do  not appear to have assimilated the further division into worshippers  of five, four, three and two gods which exist among the Gonds in some  localities, and the system is confined to the lower subtribes. The  meanings of the sept names have been forgotten and no instances of  totemism are known. And the Binjhwars and Bharotias, who are more or  less Hinduised, have now adopted territorial names for their septs,  as Lapheya from Lapha zamindari, Ghugharia from Ghughri village in  Mandla, and so"]]]
