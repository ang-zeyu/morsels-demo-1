Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower,  the Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate.            43: THE PRIME REQUISITES FOR THEM THAT TAKE COUNSEL ...      The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of  motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction  to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones,  patience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted  Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes,  victory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be vouchsafed to them.            44: THE MEMBERS THEREOF MUST TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER ...      The members thereof(30) must take counsel together in such wise that no  occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when  every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth  forth his argument. Should anyone oppose, he must on no account feel hurt  for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed.  The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing  opinions. If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously well and  good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a  majority of voices must prevail.            45: THE FIRST CONDITION IS ABSOLUTE LOVE AND HARMONY ...      The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of  the assembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest  in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the  drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the  trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should harmony of thought  and absolute unity be nonexistent, that gathering shall be dispersed and  that assembly be brought to naught. The second condition is that the  members of the assembly should unitedly elect a chairman and lay down  guide-lines and by-laws for their meetings and discussions. The chairman  should have charge of such rules and regulations and protect and enforce  them; the other members should be submissive, and refrain from conversing  on superfluous and extraneous matters. They must, when coming together,  turn their faces to the Kingdom on high and ask aid from the Realm of  Glory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity,  care and moderation to express their views. They must in every matter  search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for  stubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to  discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. The honoured  members must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no  wise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must  with moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion  arise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to  the majority. It is again not permitted that any one of the honoured  members object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any  decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for  such criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. In short,  whatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and purity of  motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement  prevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness.... If this be so  regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to  coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One.... Should they  endeavour to fulfil these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be  vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become the centre of the  Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their  aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of Spirit.            46: O YE WHO ARE FIRM IN THE COVENANT! 'ABDU'L-BAHA ...      O ye who are firm in the Covenant! 'Abdu'l-Baha is constantly engaged in  ideal communication with any Spiritual Assembly which is instituted  through the divine bounty, and the members of which, in the utmost  devotion, turn to the divine Kingdom and are firm in the Covenant. To them  he is whole-heartedly attached and with them he is linked by everlasting  ties. Thus correspondence with that gathering is sincere, constant and  uninterrupted.    At every instant, I beg for you assistance, bounty, and a fresh favour and  blessing, so that the confirmations of Baha'u'llah may, like unto the sea,  be constantly surging, the lights of the Sun of Truth may shine upon you  all and that ye may be confirmed in service, may become the manifestations  of bounty and that each one of you may, at dawn, turn unto the Holy Land  and may experience spiritual emotions with all intensity.            47: O YE TRUE FRIENDS! YOUR LETTER HATH BEEN RECEIVED ...      O ye true friends! Your letter hath been received and it brought great  joy. God be praised, ye had made ready an entertainment and established  the feast which is to be held every nineteen days. Whatsoever gathering is  arranged with the utmost love, and where those who attend are turning  their faces toward the Kingdom of God, and where the discourse is of the  Teachings of God, and the effect of which is to cause those present to  advance--that gathering is the Lord's, and that festive table hath come  down from heaven.    It is my hope that this feast will be given on one day out of every  nineteen, for it bringeth you closer together; it is the very well-spring  of unity and loving-kindness.    Ye observe to what a degree the world is in continual turmoil and  conflict, and to what a pass its nations have now come. Perchance will the  lovers of God succeed in upraising the banner of human unity, so that the  one-coloured tabernacle of the Kingdom of Heaven will cast its sheltering  shadow over all the earth; that misunderstandings among the world's  peoples will vanish away; that all nations will mingle one with another,  dealing with one another even as the lover with his beloved.    It is your duty to be exceedingly kind to every human being, and to wish  him well; to work for the upliftment of society; to blow the breath of  life into the dead; to act in accordance with the instructions of  Baha'u'llah and walk His path--until ye change the world of man into the  world of God.            48: O YE LOYAL SERVANTS OF THE ANCIENT BEAUTY! IN EVERY ...      O ye loyal servants of the Ancient Beauty! In every cycle and  dispensation, the feast hath been favoured and loved, and the spreading of  a table for the lovers of God hath been considered a praiseworthy act.  This is especially the case today, in this dispensation beyond compare,  this most generous of ages, when it is highly acclaimed, for it is truly  accounted among such gatherings as are held to worship and glorify God.  Here the holy verses, the heavenly odes and laudations are intoned, and  the heart is quickened, and carried away from itself.    The primary intent is to kindle these stirrings of the spirit, but at the  same time it follows quite naturally that those present should partake of  food, so that the world of the body may mirror the spirit's world, and  flesh take on the qualities of soul; and just as the spiritual delights  are here in profusion, so too the material delights.    Happy are ye, to be observing this rule, with all its mystic meanings,  thus keeping the friends of God alert and heedful, and bringing them peace  of mind, and joy.            49: THY LETTER HATH BEEN RECEIVED. THOU DIDST WRITE OF ...      Thy letter hath been received. Thou didst write of the Nineteen Day  festivity, and this rejoiced my heart. These gatherings cause the divine  table to descend from heaven, and draw down the confirmations of the  All-Merciful. My hope is that the breathings of the Holy Spirit will be  wafted over them, and that each one present shall, in great assemblies,  with an eloquent tongue and a heart flooded with the love of God, set  himself to acclaiming the rise of the Sun of Truth, the dawn of the  Day-Star that lighteth all the world.            50: YOU HAVE ASKED AS TO THE FEAST IN EVERY BAHA'I ...      You have asked as to the feast in every Baha'i month. This feast is held  to foster comradeship and love, to call God to mind and supplicate Him  with contrite hearts, and to encourage benevolent pursuits.    That is, the friends should there dwell upon God and glorify Him, read the  prayers and holy verses, and treat one another with the utmost affection  and love.            51: AS TO THE NINETEEN DAY FEAST, IT REJOICETH MIND AND ...      As to the Nineteen Day Feast, it rejoiceth mind and heart. If this feast  be held in the proper fashion, the friends will, once in nineteen days,  find themselves spiritually restored, and endued with a power that is not  of this world.            52: O SERVANT OF THE ONE TRUE GOD! THE LORD BE ...      O servant of the One true God! The Lord be praised, the loved ones of God  are found in every land, and are, one and all, neath the shadow of the  Tree of Life and under the protection of His good providence. His care and  loving-kindness surge even as the eternal billows of the sea, and His  blessings are continually showered from His eternal Kingdom.    Ours should be the prayer that His blessings may be vouchsafed in still  greater abundance, and ours to hold fast to such means as shall ensure a  fuller outpouring of His grace and a greater measure of His divine  assistance.    One of the greatest of these means is the spirit of true fellowship and  loving communion amongst the friends. Remember the saying: 'Of all  pilgrimages the greatest is to relieve the sorrow-laden heart.'            53: VERILY, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#18)"],[1,"wanderers and  homeless, even forgetting their own existence. Then they received the help  of God, and the power of the Holy Spirit became manifested; the  spirituality of Christ triumphed, and the love of God reigned. They were  given help at that time and dispersed in different directions, teaching  the Cause of God, and giving forth proofs and evidences.    So the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles means their attraction  by the Christ Spirit, whereby they acquired stability and firmness.  Through the spirit of the love of God they gained a new life, and they saw  Christ living, helping and protecting them. They were like drops, and they  became seas; they were like feeble insects, and they became majestic  eagles; they were weak and became powerful. They were like mirrors facing  the sun; verily, some of the light became manifest in them.          25: THE HOLY SPIRIT      Question.--What is the Holy Spirit?    Answer.--The Holy Spirit is the Bounty of God and the luminous rays which  emanate from the Manifestations; for the focus of the rays of the Sun of  Reality was Christ, and from this glorious focus, which is the Reality of  Christ, the Bounty of God reflected upon the other mirrors which were the  reality of the Apostles. The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles  signifies that the glorious divine bounties reflected and appeared in  their reality. Moreover, entrance and exit, descent and ascent, are  characteristics of bodies and not of spirits--that is to say, sensible  realities enter and come forth, but intellectual subtleties and mental  realities, such as intelligence, love, knowledge, imagination and thought,  do not enter, nor come forth, nor descend, but rather they have direct  connection.    For example, knowledge, which is a state attained to by the intelligence,  is an intellectual condition; and entering and coming out of the mind are  imaginary conditions; but the mind is connected with the acquisition of  knowledge, like images reflected in a mirror.    Therefore, as it is evident and clear that the intellectual realities do  not enter and descend, and it is absolutely impossible that the Holy  Spirit should ascend and descend, enter, come out or penetrate, it can  only be that the Holy Spirit appears in splendor, as the sun appears in  the mirror.    In some passages in the Holy Books the Spirit is spoken of, signifying a  certain person, as it is currently said in speech and conversation that  such a person is an embodied spirit, or he is a personification of mercy  and generosity. In this case, it is the light we look at, and not the  glass.    In the Gospel of John, in speaking of the Promised One Who was to come  after Christ, it is said in chapter 16, verses 12, 13: \"I have yet many  things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the  Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall  not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak.\"    Now consider carefully that from these words, \"for He shall not speak of  Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak,\" it is clear  that the Spirit of truth is embodied in a Man Who has individuality, Who  has ears to hear and a tongue to speak. In the same way the name \"Spirit  of God\" is used in relation to Christ, as you speak of a light, meaning  both the light and the lamp.          26: THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST AND THE DAY OF JUDGMENT      It is said in the Holy Books that Christ will come again, and that His  coming depends upon the fulfillment of certain signs: when He comes, it  will be with these signs. For example, \"The sun will be darkened, and the  moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven....  And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall  all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man  coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\"(90)  Baha'u'llah has explained these verses in the Kitab-i-Iqan.(91) There is  no need of repetition; refer to it, and you will understand these sayings.    But I have something further to say upon this subject. At His first coming  Christ also came from heaven, as it is explicitly stated in the Gospel.  Christ Himself says: \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that  came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"(92)    It is clear to all that Christ came from heaven, although apparently He  came from the womb of Mary. At the first coming He came from heaven,  though apparently from the womb; in the same way, also, at His second  coming He will come from heaven, though apparently from the womb. The  conditions that are indicated in the Gospel for the second coming of  Christ are the same as those that were mentioned for the first coming, as  we said before.    The Book of Isaiah announces that the Messiah will conquer the East and  the West, and all nations of the world will come under His shadow, that  His Kingdom will be established, that He will come from an unknown place,  that the sinners will be judged, and that justice will prevail to such a  degree that the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and the kid, the sucking  child and the asp, shall all gather at one spring, and in one meadow, and  one dwelling.(93) The first coming was also under these conditions, though  outwardly none of them came to pass. Therefore, the Jews rejected Christ,  and, God forbid! called the Messiah masi_kh_,(94) considered Him to be the  destroyer of the edifice of God, regarded Him as the breaker of the  Sabbath and the Law, and sentenced Him to death. Nevertheless, each one of  these conditions had a signification that the Jews did not understand;  therefore, they were debarred from perceiving the truth of Christ.    The second coming of Christ also will be in like manner: the signs and  conditions which have been spoken of all have meanings, and are not to be  taken literally. Among other things it is said that the stars will fall  upon the earth. The stars are endless and innumerable, and modern  mathematicians have established and proved scientifically that the globe  of the sun is estimated to be about one million and a half times greater  than the earth, and each of the fixed stars to be a thousand times larger  than the sun. If these stars were to fall upon the surface of the earth,  how could they find place there? It would be as though a thousand million  of Himalaya mountains were to fall upon a grain of mustard seed. According  to reason and science this thing is quite impossible. What is even more  strange is that Christ said: \"Perhaps I shall come when you are yet  asleep, for the coming of the Son of man is like the coming of a  thief.\"(95) Perhaps the thief will be in the house, and the owner will not  know it.    It is clear and evident that these signs have symbolic signification, and  that they are not literal. They are fully explained in the Kitab-i-Iqan.  Refer to it.          27: THE TRINITY      Question.--What is the meaning of the Trinity, of the Three Persons in One?    Answer.--The Divine Reality, which is purified and sanctified from the  understanding of human beings and which can never be imagined by the  people of wisdom and of intelligence, is exempt from all conception. That  Lordly Reality admits of no division; for division and multiplicity are  properties of creatures which are contingent existences, and not accidents  which happen to the self-existent.    The Divine Reality is sanctified from singleness, then how much more from  plurality. The descent of that Lordly Reality into conditions and degrees  would be equivalent to imperfection and contrary to perfection, and is,  therefore, absolutely impossible. It perpetually has been, and is, in the  exaltation of holiness and sanctity. All that is mentioned of the  Manifestations and Dawning-places of God signifies the divine reflection,  and not a descent into the conditions of existence.(96)    God is pure perfection, and creatures are but imperfections. For God to  descend into the conditions of existence would be the greatest of  imperfections; on the contrary, His manifestation, His appearance, His  rising are like the reflection of the sun in a clear, pure, polished  mirror. All the creatures are evident signs of God, like the earthly  beings upon all of which the rays of the sun shine. But upon the plains,  the mountains, the trees and fruits, only a portion of the light shines,  through which they become visible, and are reared, and attain to the  object of their existence, while the Perfect Man(97) is in the condition  of a clear mirror in which the Sun of Reality becomes visible and manifest  with all its qualities and perfections. So the Reality of Christ was a  clear and polished mirror of the greatest purity and fineness. The Sun of  Reality, the Essence of Divinity, reflected itself in this mirror and  manifested its light and heat in it; but from the exaltation of its  holiness, and the heaven of its sanctity, the Sun did not descend to dwell  and abide in the mirror. No, it continues to subsist in its exaltation and  sublimity, while appearing and becoming manifest in the mirror in beauty  and perfection.    Now if we say that we have seen the Sun in two mirrors--one the Christ and  one the Holy Spirit--that is to say, that we have seen three Suns, one in  heaven and the two others on the earth, we speak truly. And if we say that  there is one Sun, and it is pure singleness, and has no partner and equal,  we again speak truly.    The epitome of the discourse is that the Reality of Christ was a clear  mirror, and the Sun of Reality--that is to say, the Essence of Oneness,  with its infinite perfections and attributes--became visible in the mirror.  The meaning is not that the Sun, which is the Essence of the Divinity,  became divided and multiplied--for the Sun is one--but it appeared in the  mirror."]]]
