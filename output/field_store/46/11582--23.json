In that case you can write to me, No. -- Madison      Avenue.                                                     \"Curtis Waring.\"    Dodger read the letter over twice, and it puzzled him.    \"He seems from the letter to take an interest in me,\" he soliloquized.  \"At any rate, he has given me money and clothes, and paid my passage  to California. What for, I wonder? I don't believe it is to get me  away from the bad influence of Tim. There must be some other reason.\"    There was another part of the letter with which Dodger did not agree.    Curtis asserted positively that he was the nephew of Tim Bolton, while  he was positive that there was no relationship between them.    In that case Curtis must have been an early acquaintance of Tim's. At  any rate, he seemed to know about his past life.    Dodger now comprehended his present situation fully. He was a  passenger on the ship _Columbia_, and there was no chance of leaving  it. He had ascertainel on inquiry that the vessel would not put in  anywhere, but would make the long voyage direct. It would be over four  months, at any rate, before he could communicate with Florence, and in  the meantime, she and Mrs. O'Keefe, whom he recognized as a good  friend, would conclude that he was dead.    It was very provoking to think that he could not even telegraph, as  that would relieve all anxiety, and he felt sure that Florence was  enough his friend to feel anxious about him.    He had just closed up his valise, when a young man of dark complexion  and of an attractive, intellectual expression, entered the cabin.    He nodded pleasantly to Dodger, and said:    \"I suppose this is Arthur Grant?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Dodger, for he had decided to adopt the name.    \"We ought to become close friends, for we are, I believe, the only  passengers.\"    \"Then you are a passenger, too?\" said Dodger, deciding, after a brief  scrutiny, that he should like his new acquaintance.    \"Yes. My name is Randolph Leslie. I have been, for the last five  years, a reporter on leading New York daily papers, and worked so  closely that my health has become somewhat affected. My doctor  recommended a sea voyage, and I have arranged for a pretty long one.\"    \"What papers have you worked for?\"    \"Oh, all the leading ones--_Tribune, World, Herald,_ and _Sun_--  sometimes one, and sometimes another. Your reason for taking this trip  can hardly be the same as mine. You don't look as if your health  required you to travel.\"    \"No,\" answered Dodger, smiling; \"but I understand that the gentleman  who engaged my passage said I was going to sea for my health.\"    \"If I were as robust as you, I shouldn't give much thought to my  health. Do you intend to remain in California?\"    \"I don't know what I do intend,\" replied Dodger. \"I didn't know I was  going to California at all until I woke up in my stateroom.\"    The young man looked surprised.    \"Didn't you know the destination of the vessel when you came on  board?\" he asked.    \"I was brought aboard in my sleep.\"    \"This is curious. It looks to me as if you had a story to tell.    \"Of course, I don't want to be curious, but if there is anyway in  which I can help you, by advice, or in any other way, I am quite ready  to do so.\"    Dodger paused, but only briefly. This young man looked friendly, and  might help him to penetrate the mystery which at present baffled him.    At any rate, his experience qualified him to give friendly advice, and  of this Dodger felt that he stood in need.    \"I ought to tell you, to begin with,\" he said, \"that I am a poor boy,  and made my living as best I could, by carrying baggage, selling  papers, etc.\"    \"I don't think any the worse of you for that. Did you live at the  lodging houses?\"    \"No; until lately I lived with a man who keeps a saloon on the Bowery,  and tended bar for him.\"    \"What was his name? As a reporter I know the Bowery pretty well.\"    \"Tim Bolton.\"    \"Tim Bolton? I know his place well. I think I must have seen you  there. Your face looked familiar to me as soon as I set eyes on you.\"    \"Very likely. A good many people came into Tim's. I couldn't pretend  to remember them all.\"    \"Was Tim a relative of yours?\"    \"I don't believe he was. I always thought that he got hold of me when  I was a kid. I don't remember the time when I wasn't with him.\"    \"I suppose you have always lived in New York?\"    \"No; I lived for several years in Australia. Tim was in the same  business there. I came on with him a year or more since.\"    \"Do you think you ever lived in New York before?\"    \"Yes; Tim has told me that I was born in New York.\"    \"I understand that you have left Tim now?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why, may I ask?\"    \"Because I didn't like the business he was in. But I liked it better  than the one he wanted me to go into.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"Burglary.\"    The young reporter started in surprise.    \"Well,\" he said, \"this is a new tack for Tim. However, I never looked  upon him as a man who would shrink from any violation of the laws,  except murder. I don't think he would do that.\"    \"No; Tim isn't quite so bad. He isn't the worst man alive, though he  is a rather hard customer. It was his wanting me to enter a house on  Madison Avenue and open a desk that led to me going on this trip.\"    \"Tell me about it, if you don't mind.\"    Thus invited, Dodger told his story to Randolph Leslie, keeping  nothing back.    He finished by showing him the letter he had found in the valise.          Chapter XXIII.  Through The Golden Gate.      \"Well, this is certainly a remarkable letter,\" said the reporter, as  he handed it back to Dodger. \"I am at a loss to understand the  interest which this man appears to feel in you.\"    \"I look upon him as my enemy,\" said Dodger. \"But an enemy doesn't  spend so much money upon another as he has.\"    \"Unless he has object in it,\" amended Leslie, shrewdly. \"Do you know  of any connection this man has with you?\"    \"No; I never heard of him until I entered his house,\" and Dodger  flushed as he thought that his entrance into the mansion on Madison  Avenue had been as a burglar.    \"It seems to me that he knows more about you than you do about him. It  also seems to me that he is anxious to get you out of New York, the  farther the better.\"    \"But what harm could I do him in New York?\" asked Dodger, puzzled.    \"That is the question which I cannot answer. You say he was  instrumental in getting his Cousin Florence out of the house?\"    \"Yes; he wanted to marry her.\"    \"And she would not consent?\"    \"No; I think she hates him.\"    \"How old is she?\"    \"Seventeen.\"    \"And he?\"    \"He looks about thirty-five.\"    \"The difference in years isn't great enough to constitute an obstacle,  provided she loved him. I am thirty years old.\"    \"I am sure Florence would prefer you to Curtis Waring.\"    \"Don't flatter me. I am vain enough already. The time may come when I  may ask your good offices with Miss Linden. What I was about to ask  was: Is Miss Linden also entitled to a share in her uncle's estate?\"    \"She is just as nearly related to him as Mr. Waring.\"    \"Then I can understand his wishing to get rid of her. I don't know why  he should want to send you to a distance. I suppose there can't be any  relationship?\"    \"Is it likely that I--a poor street boy--should be related to a rich  man like Mr. Linden?\"    \"It doesn't seem likely, I admit,\" said Leslie, musingly. \"Well, I  suppose,\" he continued, after a pause, \"there is no use in speculating  about the matter now. The important point is, what are we to do with  ourselves during the four or five months we must spend on shipboard?\"    \"I don't know what I can do,\" said Dodger. \"I can't sell papers, and I  can't smash baggage.\"    \"And there appears to be no need of your doing either, as you are  provided with board and lodging till we reach shore.\"    \"That seems strange to me, for I've always had to hustle for a  living.\"    \"I was about to make a proposal to you. But first let me ask you about  your education. I suppose you are not an accomplished scholar?\"    \"I'm about as ignorant as they make 'em,\" answered Dodger, drolly.  \"Tim was afraid to send me to college, for fear I'd get to know too  much for my business.\"    \"Tending bar does not require an acquaintance with Latin and Greek.  Would you like to know more?\"    \"I wish I did. Florence was teaching me nights when I was in New York.  Now I've got to give up all that.\"    \"Not necessarily. Listen to me, Arthur. Before I came to New York to  go into journalism, I taught school for two years; and I believe I may  say that I was tolerably successful. Suppose I take you as a scholar?\"    \"I should like it very much, Mr. Leslie, but I'm afraid I haven't got  money enough to pay you.\"    \"That is true. You will need all the money you have when you land in  California. Twenty-five dollars won't go far--still you have all the  money that is necessary, for I do not intend to charge you anything.\"    \"You are very kind to me, Mr. Leslie, considerin' you don't know me,\"  said Dodger, gratefully.    \"On the contrary, I think I know you very well. But about the kindness  --my motives are somewhat mixed. I should like to do you a service,  but I should also like to find employment for myself that will make  the days less monotonous. I have a collection of books in my trunk,  enough for our needs, and if you will agree we will commence our  studies to-morrow.\"    \"I should like it very much. I'd like to show Florence, when I see  her, that I have improved. Till I saw her I didn't care much, but when  I talk with her I feel awfully ignorant.\"    \"In four months a great deal can be accomplished. I don't know how  quick you are to learn. After we have had one or two lessons I can  judge better.\"    Two days later Mr. Leslie pronounced his opinion, and a favorable one.    \"You have not exaggerated your ignorance,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#18)"],[1," cobweb-spinners in mind of the humiliating fact, which they have had  thrust on them daily from that time till now, and yet have never learnt  the lesson, that all their scholastic cunning, plotting, intriguing,  bulls, pardons, indulgences, and the rest of it, are, on this side  the Channel, a mere enchanter's cloud-castle and Fata Morgana, which  vanishes into empty air by one touch of that magic wand, the constable's  staff. \"A citizen of a free country!\"--there was the rub; and they  looked at each other in more utter perplexity than ever. At last Parsons  spoke.    \"There's a woman in the wind. I'll lay my life on it. I saw him blush up  crimson yesterday when his mother asked him whether some Rose Salterne  or other was still in the neighborhood.\"    \"A woman! Well, the spirit may be willing, though the flesh be weak. We  will inquire into this. The youth may do us good service as a layman;  and if anything should happen to his elder brother (whom the saints  protect!) he is heir to some wealth. In the meanwhile, our dear brother  Parsons will perhaps see the expediency of altering our tactics somewhat  while we are here.\"    And thereupon a long conversation began between the two, who had been  sent together, after the wise method of their order, in obedience to the  precept, \"Two are better than one,\" in order that Campian might restrain  Parsons' vehemence, and Parsons spur on Campian's gentleness, and so  each act as the supplement of the other, and each also, it must be  confessed, gave advice pretty nearly contradictory to his fellow's if  occasion should require, \"without the danger,\" as their writers have it,  \"of seeming changeable and inconsistent.\"    The upshot of this conversation was, that in a day or two (during which  time Mr. Leigh and Eustace also had made the amende honorable, and  matters went smoothly enough) Father Campian asked Father Francis,  the household chaplain, to allow him, as an especial favor, to hear  Eustace's usual confession on the ensuing Friday.    Poor Father Francis dared not refuse so great a man; and assented with  an inward groan, knowing well that the intent was to worm out some  family secrets, whereby his power would be diminished, and the Jesuits'  increased. For the regular priesthood and the Jesuits throughout England  were toward each other in a state of armed neutrality, which wanted but  little at any moment to become open war, as it did in James the First's  time, when those meek missionaries, by their gentle moral tortures,  literally hunted to death the poor Popish bishop of Hippopotamus (that  is to say, London) for the time being.    However, Campian heard Eustace's confession; and by putting to him such  questions as may be easily conceived by those who know anything about  the confessional, discovered satisfactorily enough, that he was what  Campian would have called \"in love:\" though I should question much  the propriety of the term as applied to any facts which poor prurient  Campian discovered, or indeed knew how to discover, seeing that a swine  has no eye for pearls. But he had found out enough: he smiled, and set  to work next vigorously to discover who the lady might be.    If he had frankly said to Eustace, \"I feel for you; and if your desires  are reasonable, or lawful, or possible, I will help you with all my  heart and soul,\" he might have had the young man's secret heart, and  saved himself an hour's trouble; but, of course, he took instinctively  the crooked and suspicious method, expected to find the case the worst  possible,--as a man was bound to do who had been trained to take the  lowest possible view of human nature, and to consider the basest motives  as the mainspring of all human action,--and began his moral torture  accordingly by a series of delicate questions, which poor Eustace dodged  in every possible way, though he knew that the good father was too  cunning for him, and that he must give in at last. Nevertheless, like a  rabbit who runs squealing round and round before the weasel, into whose  jaws it knows that it must jump at last by force of fascination, he  parried and parried, and pretended to be stupid, and surprised, and  honorably scrupulous, and even angry; while every question as to her  being married or single, Catholic or heretic, English or foreign,  brought his tormentor a step nearer the goal. At last, when Campian,  finding the business not such a very bad one, had asked something about  her worldly wealth, Eustace saw a door of escape and sprang at it.    \"Even if she be a heretic, she is heiress to one of the wealthiest  merchants in Devon.\"    \"Ah!\" said Campian, thoughtfully. \"And she is but eighteen, you say?\"    \"Only eighteen.\"    \"Ah! well, my son, there is time. She may be reconciled to the Church:  or you may change.\"    \"I shall die first.\"    \"Ah, poor lad! Well; she may be reconciled, and her wealth may be of use  to the cause of Heaven.\"    \"And it shall be of use. Only absolve me, and let me be at peace. Let  me have but her,\" he cried piteously. \"I do not want her wealth,--not I!  Let me have but her, and that but for one year, one month, one day!--and  all the rest--money, fame, talents, yea, my life itself, hers if it be  needed--are at the service of Holy Church. Ay, I shall glory in showing  my devotion by some special sacrifice,--some desperate deed. Prove me  now, and see what there is I will not do!\"    And so Eustace was absolved; after which Campian added,--    \"This is indeed well, my son: for there is a thing to be done now, but  it may be at the risk of life.\"    \"Prove me!\" cried Eustace, impatiently.    \"Here is a letter which was brought me last night; no matter from  whence; you can understand it better than I, and I longed to have shown  it you, but that I feared my son had become--\"    \"You feared wrongly, then, my dear Father Campian.\"    So Campian translated to him the cipher of the letter.    \"This to Evan Morgans, gentleman, at Mr. Leigh's house in Moorwinstow,  Devonshire. News may be had by one who will go to the shore of Clovelly,  any evening after the 25th of November, at dead low tide, and there  watch for a boat, rowed by one with a red beard, and a Portugal by his  speech. If he be asked, 'How many?' he will answer, 'Eight hundred and  one.' Take his letters and read them. If the shore be watched, let him  who comes show a light three times in a safe place under the cliff  above the town; below is dangerous landing. Farewell, and expect great  things!\"    \"I will go,\" said Eustace; \"to-morrow is the 25th, and I know a sure and  easy place. Your friend seems to know these shores well.\"    \"Ah! what is it we do not know?\" said Campian, with a mysterious smile.  \"And now?\"    \"And now, to prove to you how I trust to you, you shall come with me,  and see this--the lady of whom I spoke, and judge for yourself whether  my fault is not a venial one.\"    \"Ah, my son, have I not absolved you already? What have I to do with  fair faces? Nevertheless, I will come, both to show you that I trust  you, and it may be to help towards reclaiming a heretic, and saving a  lost soul: who knows?\"    So the two set out together; and, as it was appointed, they had just got  to the top of the hill between Chapel and Stow mill, when up the lane  came none other than Mistress Rose Salterne herself, in all the glories  of a new scarlet hood, from under which her large dark languid eyes  gleamed soft lightnings through poor Eustace's heart and marrow. Up  to them she tripped on delicate ankles and tiny feet, tall, lithe, and  graceful, a true West-country lass; and as she passed them with a  pretty blush and courtesy, even Campian looked back at the fair innocent  creature, whose long dark curls, after the then country fashion, rolled  down from beneath the hood below her waist, entangling the soul of  Eustace Leigh within their glossy nets.    \"There!\" whispered he, trembling from head to foot. \"Can you excuse me  now?\"    \"I had excused you long ago;\" said the kindhearted father. \"Alas, that  so much fair red and white should have been created only as a feast for  worms!\"    \"A feast for gods, you mean!\" cried Eustace, on whose common sense the  naive absurdity of the last speech struck keenly; and then, as if to  escape the scolding which he deserved for his heathenry--    \"Will you let me return for a moment? I will follow you: let me go!\"    Campian saw that it was of no use to say no, and nodded. Eustace darted  from his side, and running across a field, met Rose full at the next  turn of the road.    She started, and gave a pretty little shriek.    \"Mr. Leigh! I thought you had gone forward.\"    \"I came back to speak to you, Rose--Mistress Salterne, I mean.\"    \"To me?\"    \"To you I must speak, tell you all, or die!\" And he pressed up close to  her. She shrank back, somewhat frightened.    \"Do not stir; do not go, I implore you! Rose, only hear me!\" And  fiercely and passionately seizing her by the hand, he poured out the  whole story of his love, heaping her with every fantastic epithet of  admiration which he could devise.    There was little, perhaps, of all his words which Rose had not heard  many a time before; but there was a quiver in his voice, and a fire in  his eye, from which she shrank by instinct.    \"Let me go!\" she said; \"you are too rough, sir!\"    \"Ay!\" he said, seizing now both her hands, \"rougher, perhaps, than the  gay gallants of Bideford, who serenade you, and write sonnets to you,  and send you posies. Rougher, but more loving, Rose! Do not turn away!  I shall die if you take your eyes off me! Tell me,--tell me, now  here--this moment--before we part--if I may love you!\"    \"Go away!\" she answered, struggling, and bursting into tears. \"This is  too rude. If I am but a merchant's daughter. I am God's child. Remember  that I am alone. Leave me; go! or I will call for help!\"    Eustace had heard or read somewhere that such expressions in a woman's  mouth "]]]
