Ebabbar, the great Sun-temple, was at Sippar,  and it is to the Sun-god that the city is naturally allotted in the new  Sumerian Version.         (1) Cf. Zimmern, _Beitraege zur Kenntniss der Bab. Relig._,       pp. 116 ff.    The last of the five Antediluvian cities in our list is Shuruppak, in  which dwelt Ut-napishtim, the hero of the Babylonian version of the  Deluge. Its site has been identified with the mounds of Fara, in the  neighbourhood of the Shatt el-Kar, the former bed of the Euphrates;  and the excavations that were conducted there in 1902 have been most  productive of remains dating from the prehistoric period of Sumerian  culture.(1) Since our text is concerned mainly with the Deluge, it  is natural to assume that the foundation of the city from which the  Deluge-hero came would be recorded last, in order to lead up to the  central episode of the text. The city of Ziusudu, the hero of the  Sumerian story, is unfortunately not given in the Third Column, but, in  view of Shuruppak's place in the list of Antediluvian cities, it is  not improbable that on this point the Sumerian and Babylonian Versions  agreed. In the Gilgamesh Epic Shuruppak is the only Antediluvian city  referred to, while in the Hebrew accounts no city at all is mentioned in  connexion with Noah. The city of Xisuthros, too, is not recorded, but as  his father came from Larankha or Larak, we may regard that city as his  in the Greek Version. Besides Larankha, the only Antediluvian cities  according to Berossus were Babylon and Sippar, and the influence of  Babylonian theology, of which we here have evidence, would be sufficient  to account for a disturbance of the original traditions. At the same  time it is not excluded that Larak was also the scene of the Deluge in  our text, though, as we have noted, the position of Shuruppak at the  close of the Sumerian list points to it as the more probable of the two.  It may be added that we cannot yet read the name of the deity to whom  Shuruppak was allotted, but as it is expressed by the city's name  preceded by the divine determinative, the rendering \"the God of  Shuruppak\" will meanwhile serve.         (1) See _Hist. of Sum. and Akk._, pp. 24 ff.    The creation of small rivers and pools, which seems to have followed  the foundation of the five sacred cities, is best explained on the  assumption that they were intended for the supply of water to the  cities and to the temples of their five patron gods. The creation of  the Euphrates and the Tigris, if recorded in our text at all, or in its  logical order, must have occurred in the upper portion of the column.  The fact that in the later Sumerian account their creation is related  between that of mankind and the building of Nippur and Erech cannot be  cited in support of this suggestion, in view of the absence of those  cities from our text and of the process of editing to which the later  version has been subjected, with a consequent disarrangement of its  episodes.          III. THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS, AND ZIUSUDU'S PIETY    From the lower part of the Third Column, where its text is first  preserved, it is clear that the gods had already decided to send a  Deluge, for the goddess Nintu or Ninkharsagga, here referred to also  as \"the holy Innanna\", wails aloud for the intended destruction of \"her  people\". That this decision has been decreed by the gods in council is  clear from a passage in the Fourth Column, where it is stated that the  sending of a flood to destroy mankind was \"the word of the assembly (of  the gods)\". The first lines preserved in the present column describe the  effect of the decision on the various gods concerned and their action at  the close of the council.    In the lines which described the Council of the Gods, broken references  to \"the people\" and \"a flood\" are preserved, after which the text  continues:         At that time Nintu (. . .) like a (. . .),       The holy Innanna lament(ed) on account of her people.       Enki in his own heart (held) counsel;       Anu, Enlil, Enki and Ninkharsagga (. . .).       The gods of heaven and earth in(voked) the name of Anu and Enlil.    It is unfortunate that the ends of all the lines in this column are  wanting, but enough remains to show a close correspondence of the first  two lines quoted with a passage in the Gilgamesh Epic where Ishtar is  described as lamenting the destruction of mankind.(1) This will be seen  more clearly by printing the two couplets in parallel columns:         SUMERIAN VERSION                  SEMITIC VERSION         At that time Nintu (. . .)       Ishtar cried aloud like a woman       like a (. . .),                     in travail,       The holy Innanna lament(ed)      Belit-ili lamented with a loud       on account of her people.           voice.         (1) Gilg. Epic, XI, l. 117 f.    The expression Belit-ili, \"the Lady of the Gods\", is attested as a title  borne both by the Semitic goddess Ishtar and by the Sumerian goddess  Nintu or Ninkharsagga. In the passage in the Babylonian Version, \"the  Lady of the Gods\" has always been treated as a synonym of Ishtar, the  second half of the couplet being regarded as a restatement of the first,  according to a recognized law of Babylonian poetry. We may probably  assume that this interpretation is correct, and we may conclude by  analogy that \"the holy Innanna\" in the second half of the Sumerian  couplet is there merely employed as a synonym of Nintu.(1) When the  Sumerian myth was recast in accordance with Semitic ideas, the _role_ of  creatress of mankind, which had been played by the old Sumerian goddess  Ninkharsagga or Nintu, was naturally transferred to the Semitic Ishtar.  And as Innanna was one of Ishtar's designations, it was possible to make  the change by a simple transcription of the lines, the name Nintu being  replaced by the synonymous title Belit-ili, which was also shared by  Ishtar. Difficulties are at once introduced if we assume with Dr.  Poebel that in each version two separate goddesses are represented as  lamenting, Nintu or Belit-ili and Innanna or Ishtar. For Innanna as  a separate goddess had no share in the Sumerian Creation, and the  reference to \"her people\" is there only applicable to Nintu. Dr. Poebel  has to assume that the Sumerian names should be reversed in order to  restore them to their original order, which he suggests the Babylonian  Version has preserved. But no such textual emendation is necessary. In  the Semitic Version Ishtar definitely displaces Nintu as the mother of  men, as is proved by a later passage in her speech where she refers to  her own bearing of mankind.(2) The necessity for the substitution of her  name in the later version is thus obvious, and we have already noted how  simply this was effected.         (1) Cf. also Jastrow, _Hebr. and Bab. Trad._, p. 336.         (2) Gilg. Epic, XI, l. 123.    Another feature in which the two versions differ is that in the Sumerian  text the lamentation of the goddess precedes the sending of the Deluge,  while in the Gilgamesh Epic it is occasioned by the actual advent of the  storm. Since our text is not completely preserved, it is just possible  that the couplet was repeated at the end of the Fourth Column after  mankind's destruction had taken place. But a further apparent difference  has been noted. While in the Sumerian Version the goddess at once  deplores the divine decision, it is clear from Ishtar's words in the  Gilgamesh Epic that in the assembly of the gods she had at any rate  concurred in it.(1) On the other hand, in Belit-ili's later speech in  the Epic, after Ut-napishtim's sacrifice upon the mountain, she appears  to subscribe the decision to Enlil alone.(2) The passages in the  Gilgamesh Epic are not really contradictory, for they can be interpreted  as implying that, while Enlil forced his will upon the other gods  against Belit-ili's protest, the goddess at first reproached herself  with her concurrence, and later stigmatized Enlil as the real author of  the catastrophe. The Semitic narrative thus does not appear, as has been  suggested, to betray traces of two variant traditions which have been  skilfully combined, though it may perhaps exhibit an expansion of the  Sumerian story. On the other hand, most of the apparent discrepancies  between the Sumerian and Babylonian Versions disappear, on the  recognition that our text gives in many passages only an epitome of the  original Sumerian Version.         (1) Cf. l. 121 f., \"Since I commanded evil in the assembly       of the gods, (and) commanded battle for the destruction of       my people\".         (2) Cf. ll. 165 ff., \"Ye gods that are here! So long as I       forget not the (jewels of) lapis lazuli upon my neck, I will       keep these days in my memory, never will I forget them! Let       the gods come to the offering, but let not Enlil come to the       offering, since he took not counsel but sent the deluge and       surrendered my people to destruction.\"    The lament of the goddess is followed by a brief account of the action  taken by the other chief figures in the drama. Enki holds counsel with  his own heart, evidently devising the project, which he afterwards  carried into effect, of preserving the seed of mankind from destruction.  Since the verb in the following line is wanting, we do not know what  action is there recorded of the four creating deities; but the fact that  the gods of heaven and earth invoked the name of Anu and Enlil suggests  that it was their will which had been forced upon the other gods.

The \"two obstinate men\" who had ruled  (p. 085)  in Henry's camp were not likely to remain long united; Wolsey could  hardly approve of any \"second king\" but himself, especially a \"second  king\" who had acquired a family bond with the first. The Venetian  ambassador plainly hints that it was through Wolsey that Suffolk lost  favour.[202] In the occasional notices of him during the next few  years it is Wolsey, and not Henry, whom Suffolk is trying to appease;  and we even find the Cardinal secretly warning the King against some  designs of the Duke that probably existed only in his own  imagination.[203]                       [Footnote 196: _Ibid._, ii., 367, 226.

It was to renew the treaty concluded the year  before, and apparently also the discussions for war upon Spain.  Francis was ready enough to confirm the treaty, particularly as it  left him free to pursue his designs on Milan. With a similar object he  made terms with the Archduke Charles, who this year assumed the  government of the Netherlands, but was completely under the control of  Chievres, a Frenchman by birth and sympathy, who signed his letters to  Francis \"your humble servant and vassal\".[204] Charles bound himself  to marry Louis XII.'s daughter Renee, and to give his grandfather  Ferdinand no aid unless he restored Navarre to Jean d'Albret. Thus  safeguarded from attack on his rear, Francis set out for Milan. The  Swiss had locked all the passes they thought practicable; but the  French generals, guided by chamois hunters and overcoming almost  insuperable obstacles, transported their artillery over the Alps   (p. 086)  near Embrun; and on 13th September, at Marignano, the great \"Battle of  the Giants\" laid the whole of Northern Italy at the French King's  feet. At Bologna he met Leo X., whose lifelong endeavour was to be  found on both sides at once, or at least on the side of the bigger  battalions; the Pope recognised Francis's claim to Milan, while  Francis undertook to support the Medici in Florence, and to  countenance Leo's project for securing the Duchy of Urbino to his  nephew Lorenzo.                       [Footnote 204: _Sp. Cal_., ii., 246.]    Henry watched with ill-concealed jealousy his rival's victorious  progress; his envy was personal, as well as political. \"Francis,\"  wrote the Bishop of Worcester in describing the interview between the  French King and the Pope at Bologna, \"is tall in stature,  broad-shouldered, oval and handsome in face, very slender in the legs  and much inclined to corpulence.\"[205] His appearance was the subject  of critical inquiry by Henry himself. On May Day, 1515, Pasqualigo[206]  was summoned to Greenwich by the King, whom he found dressed in green,  \"shoes and all,\" and mounted on a bay Frieslander sent him by the  Marquis of Mantua; his guard were also dressed in green and armed with  bows and arrows for the usual May Day sports. They breakfasted in  green bowers some distance from the palace. \"His Majesty,\" continues  Pasqualigo, \"came into our arbor, and addressing me in French, said:  'Talk with me awhile. The King of France, is he as tall as I am?' I  told him there was but little difference. He continued, 'Is he as  stout?' I said he was not; and he then inquired, 'What sort of legs  has he?' I replied 'Spare'. Whereupon he opened the front of his   (p. 087)  doublet, and placing his hand on his thigh, said: 'Look here; and  I also have a good calf to my leg'. He then told me he was very fond  of this King of France, and that on more than three occasions he was  very near him with his army, but that he would never allow himself to  be seen, and always retreated, which His Majesty attributed to  deference for King Louis, who did not choose an engagement to take  place.\" After dinner, by way of showing his prowess, Henry \"armed  himself _cap-a-pie_ and ran thirty courses, capsizing his opponent,  horse and all\". Two months later, he said to Giustinian: \"I am aware  that King Louis, although my brother-in-law, was a bad man. I know not  what this youth may be; he is, however, a Frenchman, nor can I say how  far you should trust him;\"[207] and Giustinian says he at once  perceived the great rivalry for glory between the two young kings.                       [Footnote 205: _L. and P._, ii., 1281.]                       [Footnote 206: _Ibid._, ii., 411; Giustinian,                     _Desp._, i., 90; _Ven. Cal._, ii., 624.]                       [Footnote 207: _Ven. Cal_., ii., 652]    Henry now complained that Francis had concealed his Italian enterprise  from him, that he was ill-treating English subjects, and interfering  with matters in Scotland. The last was his real and chief ground for  resentment. Francis had no great belief that Henry would keep the  peace, and resist the temptation to attack him, if a suitable  opportunity were to arise. So he had sent the Duke of Albany to  provide Henry with an absorbing disturbance in Scotland. Since the  death of James IV. at Flodden, English influence had, in Margaret's  hands, been largely increased. Henry took upon himself to demand a  voice in Scotland's internal affairs. He claimed the title of  \"Protector of Scotland\"; and wrote to the Pope asking him to       (p. 088)  appoint no Scottish bishops without his consent, and to reduce the  Archbishopric of St. Andrews to its ancient dependence on York.[208]  Many urged him to complete the conquest of Scotland, but this  apparently he refused on the ground that his own sister was really its  ruler and his own infant nephew its king. Margaret, however, as an  Englishwoman, was hated in Scotland, and she destroyed much of her  influence by marrying the Earl of Angus. So the Scots clamoured for  Albany, who had long been resident at the French Court and was heir to  the Scottish throne, should James IV.'s issue fail. His appearance was  the utter discomfiture of the party of England; Margaret was besieged  in Stirling and ultimately forced to give up her children to Albany's  keeping, and seek safety in flight to her brother's dominions.[209]                       [Footnote 208: _L. and P._, i., 4483, 4502; ii.,                     654.]                       [Footnote 209: It was said by the Scots Estates                     that she had forfeited her claim to their custody                     by her marriage with Angus (_ibid._, ii., 1011).]    Technically, Francis had not broken his treaty with England, but he  had scarcely acted the part of a friend; and if Henry could retaliate  without breaking the peace, he would eagerly seize any opportunity  that offered. The alliance with Ferdinand and Maximilian was renewed,  and a new Holy League formed under Leo's auspices. But Leo soon  afterwards made his peace at Bologna with France. Charles was under  French influence, and Henry's council and people were not prepared for  war. So he refused, says Giustinian, Ferdinand's invitations to join  in an invasion of France. He did so from no love of Francis, and it  was probably Wolsey's ingenuity which suggested the not very scrupulous  means of gratifying Henry's wish for revenge. Maximilian was       (p. 089)  still pursuing his endless quarrel with Venice; and the seizure of  Milan by the French and Venetian allies was a severe blow to  Maximilian himself, to the Swiss, and to their protege, Sforza. Wolsey  now sought to animate them all for an attempt to recover the duchy,  and Sforza promised him 10,000 ducats a year from the date of his  restoration. There was nothing but the spirit of his treaty with  France to prevent Henry spending his money as he thought fit; and it  was determined to hire 20,000 Swiss mercenaries to serve under the  Emperor in order to conquer Milan and revenge Marignano.[210] The  negotiation was one of great delicacy; not only was secrecy absolutely  essential, but the money must be carefully kept out of Maximilian's  reach. \"Whenever,\" wrote Pace, \"the King's money passed where the  Emperor was, he would always get some portion of it by force or false  promises of restitution.\"[211] The accusation was justified by  Maximilian's order to Margaret, his daughter, to seize Henry's  treasure as soon as he heard it was on the way to the Swiss.[212] \"The  Emperor,\" said Julius II., \"is light and inconstant, always begging  for other men's money, which he wastes in hunting the chamois.\"[213]                       [Footnote 210: _L. and P._, ii., 1065.]                       [Footnote 211: _Ibid._, ii., 1817.]                       [Footnote 212: _Ibid._, ii., 1231.]                       [Footnote 213: _Ibid._, ii., 1877.]    The envoy selected for this difficult mission was Richard Pace,  scholar and author, and friend of Erasmus and More.
