The skipper gets anxious and the mates out of  temper, and if it does come on to blow hard, from the wrong  quarter, there's never no saying what will come of it.    \"No, my lad, there's nothing like a good open sea, with no land  within five hundred miles of you, at the least. The coast of Africa  ain't a pleasant neighbour. What with the low shores, which you  don't see till you are pretty nigh close to them; what with the  currents and the changeable winds, and the precious bad lookout  there is, if you do get cast ashore, I tell you the wider berth you  gives it, the better.\"    The next morning was so fine and bright that all the passengers  were on deck, and after breakfast the word was passed forward that  the carpenter was wanted. Reuben found that he was wanted to nail  some strips of wood on the floor of some of the cabins, to prevent  the boxes from shooting out from under the berths when the vessel  rolled. As he was at work at one of these, a young lady came to the  door of the cabin, and uttered a little exclamation of surprise at  seeing Reuben kneeling on the floor. Then, seeing what he was  doing, she said:    \"Oh, you are the carpenter, I suppose?\"    \"Yes, miss.\"    \"I wish you would screw on some pegs I brought with me, to hang  things upon. Everything does get thrown about so, when the ship's  rolling. They are in that trunk, if you will not mind pulling it  out.\"    Reuben pulled out the trunk, which the girl opened and, after some  search, produced half-a-dozen iron clothes pegs. She showed him  where she wished them screwed on, and stood looking on while he  carried out her instructions.    \"Are you the ship's carpenter?\"    \"Yes, miss.\"    \"You seem very young for a carpenter, don't you?\"    \"I am young,\" Reuben replied, smiling, \"and this is my first  voyage. Fortunately for me, the hand who was engaged hurt himself,  just as the vessel was sailing, so I obtained the berth. So far it  does not appear that it is a difficult one.\"    The girl looked at him a little curiously. His manner of talk and  conversation differed, so much, from the sailors in general.    \"Are you really a carpenter?\" she asked. \"You don't look like a  carpenter.\"    \"Yes, I am really a carpenter,\" Reuben answered; \"at least, I am a  mill wright by trade. We are a sort of half and half between  carpenter and smith.    \"Is there anything else?\" he asked, as he finished screwing the  last screw.    \"No, nothing else, thank you,\" the girl answered. \"That will do  very nicely, and I am much obliged to you.\"    After finishing his work in the cabins, Reuben went forward.    \"Captain,\" the young lady said, as she went upon deck, \"I have been  talking to that young carpenter of yours. I am quite interested in  him. Is he really a carpenter? He does not talk a bit like one.\"    \"I believe so, Miss Hudson,\" the captain replied. \"At least, he  produced an excellent testimonial from his last employer, when I  engaged him. Of course, it might not have been genuine. If there  had been time, I should have made more inquiries; but he was well  spoken, and had an earnest look about him. But, now you mention it,  I don't know that it is very wise letting him go into all the  cabins, when I know so little about him.\"    \"Oh, I never thought of that!\" the girl exclaimed. \"I am sure he  looks honest. It was only because he spoke so well that I mentioned  it.\"    \"He seems to be a sharp young fellow,\" the captain remarked, \"and I  see that he has taken to going aloft with the rest of the crew  already. He is an emigrant rather than a sailor, for he has only  shipped for a passage. I don't know whether he is going to join a  man, out there; but if not, he is certainly young to go out on his  own account. I do not think he's more than eighteen. He looks so  young, he cannot have served all his time at his trade.\"    \"I really feel quite interested in him, Captain Wilson,\" the girl  said, turning to a gentleman standing by, who had been listening to  the conversation. \"I wish, if you get an opportunity, you would get  into conversation with this carpenter of ours, and find out  something about him.\"    \"I will, if you like, Miss Hudson; but I don't suppose there's much  to find out, and what there is, he's not likely to tell me. From  what you say, I should guess that he had had a bad master, and had  run away.\"    \"But the captain said he had good testimonials,\" Miss Hudson  persisted.    \"As to testimonials,\" the gentleman said, \"anyone can write a  testimonial.\"    \"How suspicious you are, Captain Wilson!\" the girl laughed. \"That's  the worst of being a police officer, and having to do with  criminals. You think whoever you come across is a rogue, until you  find out he is an honest man. Now, I think everyone is honest, till  I find him out to be a rogue.\"    \"My way is the safest,\" the officer laughed. \"At any rate, on board  this ship there are five rogues to each honest man.\"    \"Ah, but that's not a fair average,\" the girl objected. \"Of course,  in the colony one has to be careful, considering that half the  shepherds and stockmen are convicts, and I must own that the  natives are nearly all thieves; but how could it be otherwise, when  England sends all its rogues out to us? You see, when free labour  gets more abundant, and we can do without convicts, the colonists  will protest against it.\"    \"Very likely they will,\" the officer agreed; \"but what is England  to do, if she has nowhere to send her rogues?\"    \"That is her business,\" Miss Hudson said carelessly. \"There is no  reason why they should be shoved on to us. In the old time, when  there were no colonies, England managed somehow, and I suppose she  could do so again.\"    \"She managed in a very short way,\" Captain Wilson said. \"She hung  them as fast as she caught them. It did not matter much what the  offence was, whether stealing a loaf or killing a man; but she  could hardly go back to that, now.\"    \"No, she could not,\" Miss Hudson agreed; \"but I have no doubt she  can find something useful for them to do, when she has to keep them  at home.    \"Don't you think so, captain?\"    \"I daresay she could,\" the captain answered. \"Certainly, if I were  a colonist living in a lonely part of the country, I should object  to transportation for, what with the natives and bush rangers and  bad characters generally, no one can say their life is safe.\"    \"Oh, it's not so bad as that, captain!\" Miss Hudson said  indignantly. \"You are giving the place a bad character.\"    \"I think Captain Wilson will agree it's a true one,\" the captain  said, smiling.    \"Eh, Captain Wilson?\"    \"I am afraid so,\" the latter replied. \"I know they keep me pretty  busy. However, after a year's holiday, I must not grumble if I find  plenty to do when I get there.\"    The voyage down to the Cape was wholly uneventful. The Paramatta  was most fortunate in her weather and, beyond trimming the sails,  the crew had a very easy time of it. Captain Wilson had, as he  promised Miss Hudson, taken the opportunity, when Reuben was  sitting idly on deck, of having a chat with him; but he did not  learn much in the course of the conversation.    \"Your young carpenter puzzles me, Miss Hudson,\" he said to her at  dinner. \"He is certainly an altogether exceptionally well-spoken  young fellow, for his condition of life; but I can't quite make him  out. I think that he has worked as a mill wright. He spoke openly  and without hesitation as to his work. But how it is he has thrown  it up and emigrated, so young, I can't make out. Of course he  cannot have served his time and yet, somehow, I don't think that he  has run away, from the manner in which he spoke of his employer.    \"He has no friends whatever in the colony, as far as I could learn.  I should say he has certainly been fairly educated, and yet he  seems, from his own account, to have worked three or four years at  his trade.    \"I certainly like the lad, though I own that, so far, I cannot  altogether make him out. Perhaps I shall learn somewhat more about  him, before we get to the end of the voyage, and in that case I  will tell you all I know.\"    Miss Hudson was the daughter of a wealthy flock owner--or, as he  was called, squatter--in New South Wales. Her father and mother  were on board the ship with her. This was her fifth voyage. She had  gone out as a baby with her parents; and had returned to England,  at the age of ten, to be educated. When eighteen, she had joined  her mother and father in Australia and, two years later, had come  with them to Europe, and had spent some months travelling on the  Continent. They were now on their way back to the colony.    The only other single lady among the passengers of the Paramatta  was going out, under the charge of the captain, to fill a place as  governess in a family in Sydney. Miss Furley was somewhat quiet,  but a friendship had naturally sprang up between her and Miss  Hudson, as the only two young women on board the ship; and the life  and high spirits of the young colonist, and the musical  acquirements of Miss Furley, helped to make the voyage pass  pleasantly for the passengers in the Paramatta.    Captain Wilson had a good tenor voice, and sang well; and one of  the other passengers was able to furnish a bass. Almost every  evening, as the ship was running down the tropics before a gentle  favouring breeze, the sound of solo and glee singing rose from the  little party gathered on the poop; and even the convicts, on deck  forward, ceased their talk and listened to the strains.    Although the passage had been a pleasant one, there was a general  feeling of satisfaction when the ship dropped her anchor in Table  Bay. Most of the passengers went on shore at once, to take up their  quarters at the hotel till she sailed again. The captain said that  it would take at least a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#18)"],[1,"the fact that he now looked very  yellow, his appearance was quite natural. Indeed, as I gazed at him, I  grew so convinced it was he that I cried out, 'Ralph!' The moment I  did so, there was a ghastly change: his eyelids opened, and his  eyes--eyes I recognised at once--protruded to such a degree that they  almost rolled out; his mouth flew open, his tongue swelled, his whole  countenance became convulsed with the most unparalleled, and for that  reason indescribable, expression of agony, whilst the yellowness of  his complexion deepened to a livid, lurid black, that was so  inconceivably repellent and hellish that I sprang away from the  bed--appalled. There was then a gasping, rasping noise, and a voice  that, despite its unnatural hollowness, I identified as that of Ralph,  broke forth: 'I have been wanting to speak to you for ages, but  _something_, I cannot explain, has always prevented me. I have been  dead a month; not cancer, but Dolly. Poison. Good-bye, Hely. I shall  rest in peace now.' The voice stopped; there was a rush of cold air,  laden with the scent of the drug, and tainted, faintly tainted, with  the nauseating smell of the grave, and--the face on the pillow  vanished. How I got through the remainder of the night I cannot say--I  dare not think. I dare only remember that I did not sleep. I was  devoted to Ralph, and the thought that he had perished in the  miserable manner suggested by the apparition, completely prostrated  me. In the morning I received a black-edged letter from my mother,  stating that she had just heard from Dolly, my brother's wife, saying  Ralph had died from cancer in the throat. Dolly added in a postscript  that her dearly beloved Ralph had been very good to her, and left her  well provided for. Of course, we might have had the body exhumed, but  we were poor, and Ralph's widow was rich; and in America, you know,  everything goes in favour of the dollars. Hence we were obliged to let  the matter drop, sincerely trusting Dolly would never take it into her  head to visit us. She never did. My mother died last year--I felt her  death terribly, O'Donnell; and as I no longer have any fixed abode,  but am always touring the British provinces, there is not much fear  of Ralph's murderess and I meeting. It is rather odd, however, that  after my own experience at the hotel, I heard that it had borne the  reputation for being haunted for many years, and that a good many  visitors who had passed the night in one of the rooms (presumably  mine) had complained of hearing strange noises and having dreadful  dreams. How can one explain it all?\"    \"One can't,\" I responded, as we turned in for the night.                                   CASE XII        THE GREY PIPER AND THE HEAVY COACH OF        DONALDGOWERIE HOUSE, PERTH      Donaldgowerie House, until comparatively recent times, stood on the  outskirts of Perth. It was a long, low, rambling old place, dating  back to the beginning of the seventeenth century. At the time of the  narrative it was in the possession of a Mr. William Whittingen, who  bought it at a very low price from some people named Tyler. It is true  that it would cost a small fortune to repair, but, notwithstanding  this disadvantage, Mr. Whittingen considered his purchase a bargain,  and was more than satisfied with it. Indeed, he knew of no other house  of a similar size, of such an imposing appearance, and so pleasantly  situated, that he could have bought for less than twice the amount he  had paid for this; and he was really very sorry for the Tylers, who  explained to him, in confidence, that had they not been in such  urgent need of money, they would never have sold Donaldgowerie House  at such a ridiculously low figure. However, with them it was a  question of cash--cash down, and Mr. Whittingen had only to write out  a cheque for the modest sum they asked, and the house was his. It was  June when Mr. Whittingen took possession of the house--June, when the  summer sun was brightest and the gardens looked their best. The  Whittingen family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Whittingen, two sons,  Ernest and Harvey, and three daughters, Ruth, Martha, and Mary, were,  as one might gather from their names alone, plain, practical, genteel,  and in fact very superior people, who were by no means lacking in that  exceedingly useful quality of canniness, so characteristic of the  Lowland Scot to which race they belonged. Mr. Whittingen had, for  years, conducted a grocery business in Jedburgh, twice filling the  honoured and coveted post of mayor, and when he at length retired into  private life, his friends (and it was astonishing how many friends he  had) shrewdly suspected that his pockets were not only well lined but  full to bursting. Acting on the advice of his wife and daughters, who  were keen on social distinction, he sent Ernest to Oxford,  conditionally that he should take Holy Orders in the Church of  England, whilst Harvey, who, when scarcely out of the petticoat stage,  displayed the regular Whittingen talent for business by covertly  helping himself to the sugar in his father's shop, and disposing of it  at strictly sale price to his sisters' cronies in the nursery, was  sent to one of those half preparatory and half finishing schools (of  course, for the sons of gentlemen only) at Edinburgh, where he was  kept till he was old enough to be articled to a prosperous,  exceedingly prosperous, firm of solicitors.    The girls, Ruth, Martha, and Mary, had likewise been highly educated,  that is to say, they had remained so many years at an English seminary  for young ladies, and had been given a final twelve months in France  and Germany to enable them to obtain \"the correct accent.\"    At the time of the story they were as yet unmarried, and were awaiting  with the most laudable patience the advent of men of title. They were  delighted with their new home (which Ruth had persuaded her father to  christen \"Donaldgowerie,\" after the house in a romantic novel she had  just been reading), and proud of their gilded premises and magnificent  tennis lawns; they had placed a gigantic and costly tray in the hall,  in confident assurance that it would speedily groan beneath the weight  of cards from all the gentry in Perthshire.    But please be it understood, that my one and only object in alluding  to these trifling details is to point out that the Whittingens, being  entirely engrossed in matters mundane, were the very last people in  the world to be termed superstitious, and although imaginative where  future husbands' calls and cards were concerned, prior to the events  about to be narrated had not an ounce of superstition in their  natures. Indeed, until then they had always smiled in a very  supercilious manner at even the smallest mention of a ghost.    September came, their first September in Donaldgowerie, and the family  welcomed with joy Ernest and his youthful bride.    The latter was not, as they had fondly hoped (and roundly announced in  Perth), the daughter of a Peer, but of a wealthy Bristol draper, the  owner of a house near the Downs, whose son had been one of Ernest's  many friends at Oxford. The coming of the newly-married pair to  Donaldgowerie brought with it a burst of bird-like gaiety. All sorts  of entertainments--musical \"at homes,\" dinners, dances, tennis and  garden parties, in fact, every variety that accorded with the family's  idea of good taste--were given; and with praiseworthy \"push,\" for  which the Whittingens had fast become noted, all the County was  invited. This splendid display of wealth and hospitality was not  disinterested; I fear, it might be not only accounted a \"send off\" for  the immaculately-clad curate and his wife, but also a determined  effort on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Whittingen to attract the right  sort of lover for their girls. It was during the progress of one of  their alfresco entertainments that the scepticism of certain of the  Whittingens with regard to the supernatural received a rude blow.  Martha, Mary, and two eligible young men, friends of Harvey's, having  finished a somewhat spirited game of croquet, were refreshing  themselves with lemonade, whilst they continued their flirtation.  Presently Mary, whose partner declared how much he should like to see  some photographs she had recently had taken of herself, with a  well-affected giggle of embarrassment set off to the house to fetch  her album. The minutes passed, and, as she did not return, Martha went  in search of her. The album, she knew, was in their boudoir, which was  situated at the end of the long and rather gloomy corridor of the  upper storey. Highly incensed at her sister's slowness, she was  hastening along the corridor, when, to her supreme astonishment, she  suddenly saw the figure of a man in kilts, with a bagpipe under his  arm, emerge through the half-open door of the boudoir, and with a  peculiar gliding motion advance towards her. A curious feeling, with  which she was totally unfamiliar, compelled her to remain mute and  motionless; and in this condition she awaited the approach of the  stranger. Who was he? she asked herself, and how on earth had he got  there, and what was he doing? As he drew nearer, she perceived that  his face was all one hue,--a ghastly, livid grey,--and that his eyes,  which were all the time fixed on hers, were lurid and menacing,--so  terrible, in fact, that she turned cold with fear, and felt the very  hair on her head beginning to rise on end. She opened her mouth to  shriek, but found she could not ejaculate a syllable; neither could  she, even with the most desperate efforts, tear her feet from the  floor. On came the figure, and, without swerving either to the right  or left, it glided right up to and through her; and, as she  involuntarily turned round, she saw it disappear through a half-open  staircase window, at least twenty feet above the ground outside.  Shaking all over with terror, and "]]]
