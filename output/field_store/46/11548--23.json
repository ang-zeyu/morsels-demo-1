Perhaps he  wondered what had turned the rook hawk.  As a matter of fact, the  weather had, partly, and the rifle had, the rest; for the rook could  see what the thrush did not yet realize.    The rook went away astern, shouting bad language, and another foe came  to take his, or her, place.  Again our thrush discovered that he was  not alone.  Little, white, silent, cruel, dancing flakes of white were  traveling more or less with him and downwards, upon the following wind.  The snow!  The snow at last!  And he was trapped, for it was to keep  ahead of the snow that he had journeyed all that way back again.  Indeed, you can hardly realize, unless you have almost lived their  life, what the snow and the frost mean to all the thrush people, but  more especially to the common song-thrush and the redwing.  At the  worst it means death; at the best, little more than a living death.    However, to race the snow were useless.  Yet he flew on, and on, and  on, like a stampeded horse, blindly, one-sidedly, while the ordnance  survey map beneath turned from brown, and chocolate, and silver-gray,  and dull green, first to pepper and salt, then to freckled white, then  all over to the spotless white eider-down quilt of the winter returned,  as far as the eye--even his binocular orbs--could reach, muffling tree  and house, and garden and copse, and farm and field, and fallow and  plow and meadow in the one mystical, silent, white disguise of winter.  And the thrush at length came down.    His eye had spotted a little corner of a garden that might have been a  spread table in the wilderness.  It was only a small triangle of lawn,  with a summer-house at its apex, and a spruce-fir and a house at its  base, and privet-hedges marking off the rest.  But it had a  \"bird-table,\" and a swept-clean circle on the grass, and there was  sopped bread upon both.  And that place was given over entirely to  chaffinches, _all hens_, tripping, mincing, pecking, feasting,  fighting--because they were chaffinches, I suppose, and must fight--all  over the place.    The thrush came to anchor upon the roof of the summer-house,  and--straightway fell upon his beak!  And that was Fate's punishment  for laziness, one second's relaxation from vigilance.    Righting himself, he almost overbalanced the other way, and only  finally managed to come to an intricate halt on one leg.  The other  leg--the right one--was twisted back under him, in line with his closed  wings and tail; that is to say, it was pointing the wrong way for a  bird's leg, or, rather, so far as could be seen among the feathers,  that was how it seemed.  But the leg was not broken; he could still  move his toes and expand his foot.  Otherwise he could do nothing with  it.  The leg might not have been there, for all the use it was to him;  it would have been better if it had not been there, for it hampered his  flight, or unbalanced him, or something, so that he was incapable of  traveling now beyond the snow, even if he would.  Undoubtedly the  air-rifle had done its work.    Now, in the wild it is a fairly sound maxim that an injured wildling is  a dead wildling--that is, unless the injury is quite slight.  There are  exceptions, of course.  Flesh-wounds and quick-healing wounds are  exceptions.    However, our thrush seemed to be no coward, and he at once buckled to,  to fight Fate and all the world--one bird _v_. the rest.  It was  appalling odds, and I guess no darn fool could have been found to back  that bird's chance of winning through.    Then he showed that he had at least one trump up his sleeve.  A shape  like unto the shape of a silken kite came floating in ample circles  across the low-hung sky.  And the color of that shape was brown--pale  brown; and the shape was alive, and had the appearance of eternally  looking for something, which it always could not find.  So hunts the  kestrel falcon, and by the same token the thrush knew that this was a  big hen-kestrel.  I say \"big\" advisedly, because in kestrel society it  is the ladies who have the weight and the vote.    And the thrush, who had by that time flown to the ground, promptly  \"froze \"--froze to stillness, I mean--and vanished.  It was a startling  little trick of his, almost an eccentricity; but the fact was that so  long as he kept still on the dark ground where the snow had been swept  away--and earth and grass mingled almost to a black whole against the  white--he was practically invisible.  This was because of his peculiar  somber color.  Had he been light of dress, like an ordinary  song-thrush, any eye could have picked him up in that spot.    Now, that kestrel was in a bad temper and vicious.  She was cursing the  snow which covered the doings of the field-mice, which ordinarily were  her \"staff of life\"; and she had not killed since dawn.  Hence she was  a public danger, even to wild-folk she usually left alone, and just now  she was looking for our thrush, who she had seen fly down and--vanish.    There he was, however, bang in the open, unshielded by any cover,  motionless on one leg, looking upwards, and, to all intents and  purposes, not there.  The kestrel came shooting up superbly, going at a  great pace on the wind, cutting the cold air like a knife, twisting and  turning her long tail tins way and that, but moving her quarter-shut  wings not one stroke.  Right over him she dived, her wonderful eyes  stabbing down, so close that you could see her small, rounded head  turning and craning.  But no thrush did she see.  She \"banked,\" hung,  swept round, and came back.  Then she hovered, like a bird hung from  the sky by an invisible hair; and for our thrush she was indeed the  sword of Damocles, for the spot in the air where she hung was directly  over him.  If anybody had shot her dead at that instant, she would have  fallen upon his back.  At that instant, or the next, she might fall  upon his back, anyway, without anybody shooting her.  Indeed, the  betting seemed a good few hundred to one that she would.    Very few human beings know the full meaning of the word \"still\"--not  even bluejackets!--but most of the wild-folk do.  They have to.  So did  the thrush, but never before had he kept so utterly, stonily, frozenly,  strickenly motionless.  If he had moved an eyelid even, winked, or  gulped too hard, it would have been all up with him.  But he didn't and  it was not all up; though the kestrel seemed as if she were going to  hover there, in that spot, through all eternity.  And when at last she  condescended to surrender to the wind and vanish like a falling star  into the horizon, our friend was as near nervous prostration and  hysteria as a bird can be.  A very little longer and I believe he would  actually have died from sheer overstrain, instead of from kestrel.    Then the thrush fed.  He did it against time, before dark, for if night  came and caught him with an empty crop, he froze.  Perhaps he would  freeze, anyway; but no matter.    The hen-chaffinches, presumably at the end of a journey, or part way  along it, too, were in a like hurry, and for the same reason.  He could  see them now only as faint splashes of white, as they opened tail and  wing to fight; but they could not fight _him_, and he savagely kept the  little clearing in the snow free of all save himself.  It was as if he  knew that he was \"up against it,\" and the fact had developed a grim  fierceness in his character.    An owl must have gone over about this time, because an owl did go over  that garden about the same time every night; but perhaps she was not  expecting thrushes in that gloom, or was in a hurry to keep an  appointment with a rat.  Anyway, the owl did not develop.    Thereafter and at last the thrush went to sleep in a spruce-fir.    Dead silence reigned over the garden, and Cold, with a capital C,  gripped the land.  Heaven help any bird who roosted on an empty stomach  on such a night!  It would freeze to its perch before morning, most  like.    Indeed, our thrush had a neighbor, a hedge-sparrow just newly arrived  from \"somewhere up north.\"  It had come in after dark, and therefore  had no time to feed.  The thrush just took his head out from under his  wing and opened one eye, as the poor little beggar perched close to him  for company.  He could see it plainly in the petrified moonlight.    When next he opened one eye and looked, dawn was at hand, and the poor  little bird was still there.  When at last, with shoulders humped and  feathers puffed, our thrush flew down to feed in the first pale-gold  glimmer of very-much-diluted sunlight, the hedge-sparrow did not move.  Now, in opening his wings, possibly from a vague idea of frightening  the hedge-sparrow away from the magic swept circle on the lawn close  by, and its bread, the thrush brushed heavily against that  hedge-sparrow, so that--oh, horror!--it fell, or swung over backwards,  rather, and hung head downwards, swaying slightly, like a toy acrobat  on a wire, before it fell, so rigidly and so stiffly immovable that one  expected it to shatter to pieces like glass as it hit the ground.  It  did not, however.  But it did not matter.  The hedge-sparrow was quite,  quite dead before it fell, frozen stiff and stark in the night.  And  none of the other birds seemed to care.  Why should they?  Such a fate  might overtake themselves.    The thrush, much tucked up, but still with some fight in him, was late.  Big flocks of peewits or green plover--he could see them between the  spruce-boughs--had gone drifting by, winking like floating silver, high  overhead, bound westward; and skylarks were passing over the garden,  one by one, heading southwest towards the warm, and chortling to each  other as they went.  Starlings--some of them with extraordinarily  bright-yellow dagger-beaks, and some with dull beaks--were before him,  squabbling and sparring over the bread on the lawn.

When in such a      condition, one side of the hammer may strike in advance of the other      just enough to throw the vibrations in opposition. Once you may get      a strong tone, and again you strike with the same force and hear but      a faint, almost inaudible sound. For this reason, as well as that of      preventing excessive wear, the hammer joint should be kept firm and      rigid.    If one of the strings vibrates 100 times in a second, and the other  101, there will be a portion of time during each second when the  vibrations will coincide, and likewise a portion of time when they  will antagonize each other. The periods of coincidence and of  antagonism pass by progressive transition from one to the other, and  the portion of time when exactitude is attained is infinitesimal; so  there will be two opposite effects noticed in every second of time:  the one, a progressive augmentation of strength and volume, the other,  a gradual diminution of the same; the former occurring when the  vibrations are coming into coincidence, the latter, when they are  approaching the point of antagonism. Therefore, when we speak of one  beat per second, we mean that there will be one period of augmentation  and one period of diminution in one second. Young tuners sometimes get  confused and accept one beat as being two, taking the period of  augmentation for one beat and likewise the period of diminution. This  is most likely to occur in the lower fifths of the temperament where  the beats are very slow.    Two strings struck at the same time, one tuned an octave higher than  the other, will vibrate in the ratio of 2 to 1. If these two strings  vary from this ratio to the amount of _one_ vibration, they will  produce _two_ beats. Two strings sounding an interval of the fifth  vibrate in the ratio of 3 to 2. If they vary from this ratio to the  amount of _one_ vibration, there will occur _three_ beats per second.  In the case of the major third, there will occur _four_ beats per  second to a variation of _one_ vibration from the true ratio of 5 to  4. You should bear this in mind in considering the proper number of  beats for an interval, the vibration number being known.    It will be seen, from the above facts in connection with the study of  the table of vibration numbers in Lesson XIII, that all fifths do not  beat alike. The lower the vibration number, the slower the beats. If,  at a certain point, a fifth beats once per second, the fifth taken an  octave higher will beat twice; and the intervening fifths will beat  from a little more than once, up to nearly twice per second, as they  approach the higher fifth. Vibrations per second double with each  octave, and so do beats.    By referring to the table in Lesson XIII, above referred to, the exact  beating of any fifth may be ascertained as follows:--    Ascertain what the vibration number of the _exact_ fifth would be,  according to the instructions given beneath the table; find the  difference between this and the _tempered_ fifth given in the table.  Multiply this difference by 3, and the result will be the number of  beats or fraction thereof, of the tempered fifth. The reason we  multiply by 3 is because, as above stated, a variation of one  vibration per second in the fifth causes three beats per second.    _Example._--Take the first fifth in the table, C-128 to G-191.78, and  by the proper calculation (see example, page 147, Lesson XIII) we find  the exact fifth to this C would be 192. The difference, then, found by  subtracting the smaller from the greater, is .22 (22/100). Multiply  .22 by 3 and the result is .66, or about two-thirds of a beat per  second.    By these calculations we learn that the fifth, C-256 to G-383.57,  should have 1.29 beats: nearly one and a third per second, and that  the highest fifth of the temperament, F-341.72 to C-512, should be  1.74, or nearly one and three-quarters. By remembering these figures,  and endeavoring to temper as nearly according to them as possible, the  tuner will find that his temperament will come up most beautifully.  This is one of the features that is overlooked or entirely unknown to  many fairly good tuners; their aim being to get all fifths the same.    ~Finishing up the Temperament.~--If your last trial, F-C, does not  prove a correct fifth, you must consider how best to rectify. The  following are the causes which result in improper temperament:        1. Fifths too flat.        2. Fifths not flat enough.        3. Some fifths correctly tempered and others not.        4. Some fifths sharper instead of flatter than perfect; a      condition that must be watched with vigilance.        5. Some or all of the strings tuned fall from the pitch at which      they were left.    From a little reflection upon these causes, it is seen that the last  trial may prove a correct fifth and yet the temperament be imperfect.  If this is the case, it will be necessary to go all over the  temperament again. Generally, however, after you have had a little  experience, you will find the trouble in one of the first two causes  above, unless it be a piano wherein, the strings fall as in Cause 5.  This latter cause can be ascertained in cases only where you have  started from a tuning pipe or fork. Sometimes you may find that the  temperament may be corrected by the alteration of but two or three  tones; so it is always well to stop and examine carefully before  attempting the correction. A haphazard attempt might cause much extra  work.    In temperament setting by our system, if the fifths are properly  tempered and the octaves are left perfect, the other intervals will  need no attention, and will be found beautifully correct when used in  testing.    The mistuned or tempered intervals are as follows:--        INTERVALS FLATTENED.     INTERVALS SHARPENED.      The Fifth, slightly.     The Fourth, slightly.      The Minor Third,         The Major Third,        considerably.             greatly.      The Minor Sixth,         The Major Sixth,        considerably.             greatly.    ~Tuning the Treble.~--In tuning the treble, which is always tuned by  exact octaves, from their corresponding tones within the temperament,  the ear will often accept an octave as true before its pitch has been  sufficiently raised. Especially is this true in the upper octaves.  After tuning a string in the treble by its octave in the temperament,  test it as a fifth. For instance, after tuning your first string  beyond the temperament, 3C[#], test it as a fifth to 2F[#]. If you are  yet uncertain, try it as a major third in the chord of A. The beats  will serve you as a guide in testing by fifths, up to about an octave  and a half above the highest tone of the temperament; but beyond this  point they become so rapid as to be only discernible as degrees of  roughness. The beats will serve as a guide in tuning _octaves_ higher  in the treble than the point at which the beats of the _fifth_ become  unavailable; and in tuning _unisons_, the beats are discernible almost  to the last tone.    The best method to follow in tuning the treble may be summed up as  follows: Tune the first octave with the beats as guides both in the  octave and in testing it by the fifth. If yet uncertain, test by  chords. Above this octave, rely somewhat upon the beats in the octave,  still use the fifth for testing, but listen for the pitch in the  extreme upper tones and not so much for the beats except in bringing  up unisons, in which the beats are more prominent.    In the extreme upper tones, the musical ear of the tuner is tried to  the utmost. Here, his judgment of correct harmonic relation is the  principal or only guide, while in the middle octaves the beats serve  him so faithfully, his musical qualifications being brought into  requisition only as a rough guide in determining pitch of the various  intervals. To tune by the beats requires a sharp ear and mental  discernment; to tune by pitch requires a fine musical ear and  knowledge of the simpler laws of harmony.    As stated above, the tuner will fail in many cases to tune his high  octaves sharp enough. Rarely, if ever, will a tuner with a good ear  leave the upper tones too sharp. Now, there is one more fact which is  of the utmost importance in tuning the treble: it is the fact that the  extreme upper octave and a half must be tuned slightly sharper than  perfect; if the octaves are tuned perfect, the upper tones of the  instrument will sound flat when used in scale and arpeggio passages  covering a large portion of the key-board. Begin to sharpen your  octaves slightly from about the seventeenth key from the last;  counting both black and white. In other words, begin to sharpen from  the last A[b] but one, in the standard scale of seven and a third  octaves of which the last key is C. Sharpen but slightly, and increase  the degree of sharpening but little as you proceed.    ~Tuning the Bass.~--In tuning the bass, listen for the beats only, in  bringing up the octaves. It is sometimes well to try the string tuned,  with its fifth, but the octave in the bass should suffice, as the  vibrations are so much slower here that if you listen acutely the  octave beats will guide you.    It is not necessary to pull the strings higher than the pitch at which  they are to stand. Learn to pull them up gradually and in a way that  will \"render\" the string over the bridges, which is an easy thing to  do, the"]]]
