As it becomes older, the lower part enlarges    slightly, the whole looking something like a long-necked flask (_C_,    _D_). The centre of the neck is occupied by a single row of cells    (canal cells), with more granular contents than the outer cells, the    lowest cell of the row being somewhat larger than the others    (Fig. 54, _C_, _o_). When nearly ripe, the division walls of the    canal cells are absorbed, and the protoplasm of the lowest cell    contracts and forms a globular naked cell, the egg cell (_D_, _o_).    If a ripe archegonium is placed in water, it soon opens at the top,    and the contents of the canal cells are forced out, leaving a clear    channel down to the egg cell. If the latter is not fertilized, the    inner walls of the neck cells turn brown, and the egg cell dies; but    if a spermatozoid penetrates to the egg cell, the latter develops a    wall and begins to grow, forming the embryo or young sporogonium.    [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Longitudinal section of a nearly full-grown  sporogonium of _Madotheca_, which has not, however, broken through the  overlying cells, x 25. _sp._ cavity in which the spores are formed.  _ar._ abortive archegonium.]      The first division wall to be formed in the embryo is transverse,    and is followed by vertical ones (Fig. 54, _E_, _em._). As the    embryo enlarges, the walls of the basal part of the archegonium grow    rapidly, so that the embryo remains enclosed in the archegonium    until it is nearly full-grown (Fig. 55). As it increases in size, it    becomes differentiated into three parts: a wedge-shaped base or    \"foot\" penetrating downward into the upper part of the plant, and    serving to supply the embryo with nourishment; second, a stalk    supporting the third part, the capsule or spore-bearing portion of    the fruit. The capsule is further differentiated into a wall, which    later becomes dark colored, and a central cavity, in which are    developed special cells, some of which by further division into four    parts produce the spores, while the others, elongating enormously,    give rise to special cells, called elaters (Fig. 56, _B_).    [Illustration: FIG. 56.--Spore (_A_) and two elaters (_B_) of  _Madotheca_, x 300.]      The ripe spores are nearly globular, contain chlorophyll and drops    of oil, and the outer wall is brown and covered with fine points    (Fig. 56, _A_). The elaters are long-pointed cells, having on the    inner surface of the wall a single or double dark brown spiral band.    These bands are susceptible to changes in moisture, and by their    movements probably assist in scattering the spores after the    sporogonium opens.    Just before the spores are ripe, the stalk of the sporogonium  elongates rapidly, carrying up the capsule, which breaks through the  archegonium wall, and finally splits into four valves, and discharges  the spores.    There are four orders of the liverworts represented in the United  States, three of which differ from the one we have studied in being  flattened plants, without distinct stems and leaves,--at least, the  leaves when present are reduced to little scales upon the lower  surface.    The first order (_Ricciaceae_) are small aquatic forms, or grow on damp  ground or rotten logs. They are not common forms, and not likely to be  encountered by the student. One of the floating species is shown in  figure 57, _A_.    The second order, the horned liverworts (_Anthoceroteae_), are  sometimes to be met with in late summer and autumn, forms growing  mostly on damp ground, and at once recognizable by their long-pointed  sporogonia, which open when ripe by two valves, like a bean pod  (Fig. 57, _B_).    The third order (_Marchantiaceae_) includes the most conspicuous  members of the whole class. Some of them, like the common liverwort  (_Marchantia_), shown in Figure 57, _F_, _K_, and the giant liverwort  (Fig. 57, _D_), are large and common forms, growing on the ground in  shady places, the former being often found also in greenhouses. They  are fastened to the ground by numerous fine, silky hairs, and the  tissues are well differentiated, the upper surface of the plant having  a well-marked epidermis, with peculiar breathing pores, large enough  to be seen with the naked eye (Fig. 57, _E_, _J_, _K_) Each of these  is situated in the centre of a little area (Fig. 57, _E_), and beneath  it is a large air space, into which the chlorophyll-bearing cells  (_cl._) of the plant project (_J_).    The sexual organs are often produced in these forms upon special  branches (_G_), or the antheridia may be sunk in discs on the upper  side of the stem (_D_, _an._).    [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Forms of liverworts. _A_, _Riccia_, natural  size. _B_, _Anthoceros_ (horned liverwort), natural size. _sp._  sporogonia. _C_, _Lunularia_, natural size, _x_, buds. _D_, giant  liverwort (_Conocephalus_), natural size. _an._ antheridial disc. _E_,  small piece of the epidermis, showing the breathing pores, x 2. _F_,  common liverwort (_Marchantia_), x 2. _x_, cups containing buds. _G_,  archegonial branch of common liverwort, natural size. _H_, two young  buds from the common liverwort, x 150. _I_, a full-grown bud, x 25.  _J_, vertical section through the body of _Marchantia_, cutting  through a breathing pore (_s_), x 50. _K_, surface view of a breathing  pore, x 150. _L_, a leafy liverwort (_Jungermannia_). _sp._  sporogonium, x 2.]    Some forms, like _Marchantia_ and _Lunularia_ (Fig. 57, _C_), produce  little cups (_x_), circular in the first, semicircular in the second,  in which special buds (_H_, _I_) are formed that fall off and produce  new plants.    The highest of the liverworts (_Jungermanniaceae_) are, for the most  part, leafy forms like _Madotheca_, and represented by a great many  common forms, growing usually on tree trunks, etc. They are much like  _Madotheca_ in general appearance, but usually very small and  inconspicuous, so as to be easily overlooked, especially as their  color is apt to be brownish, and not unlike that of the bark on which  they grow (Fig. 57, _L_).      CLASS II.--THE TRUE MOSSES.    The true mosses (_Musci_) resemble in many respects the higher  liverworts, such as _Madotheca_ or _Jungermannia_, all of them having  well-marked stems and leaves. The spore fruit is more highly  developed than in the liverworts, but never contains elaters.    A good idea of the general structure of the higher mosses may be had  from a study of almost any common species. One of the most convenient,  as well as common, forms (_Funaria_) is to be had almost the year  round, and fruits at almost all seasons, except midwinter. It grows in  close patches on the ground in fields, at the bases of walls,  sometimes in the crevices between the bricks of sidewalks, etc. If  fruiting, it may be recognized by the nodding capsule on a long stalk,  that is often more or less twisted, being sensitive to changes in the  moisture of the atmosphere. The plant (Fig. 58, _A_, _B_) has a short  stem, thickly set with relatively large leaves. These are oblong and  pointed, and the centre is traversed by a delicate midrib. The base of  the stem is attached to the ground by numerous fine brown hairs.    The mature capsule is broadly oval in form (Fig. 58, _C_), and  provided with a lid that falls off when the spores are ripe. While the  capsule is young it is covered by a pointed membranous cap (_B_,  _cal._) that finally falls off. When the lid is removed, a fine fringe  is seen surrounding the opening of the capsule, and serving the same  purpose as the elaters of the liverworts (Fig. 58, _E_).    [Illustration: FIG. 58.--_A_, fruiting plant of a moss (_Funaria_),  with young sporogonium (_sp._), x 4.

Sometimes the ground  about young patches of the moss is quite covered by a fine film of  such threads, and looking carefully over it probably very small moss  plants may be seen growing up here and there from it.    [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Longitudinal section through the summit of a  small male plant of _Funaria_. _a_, _a'_, antheridia. _p_, paraphysis.  _L_, section of a leaf, x 150.]    This moss is dioecious. The male plants are smaller than the female,  and may be recognized by the bright red antheridia which are formed at  the end of the stem in considerable numbers, and surrounded by a  circle of leaves so that the whole looks something like a flower.  (This is still more evident in some other mosses. See Figure 65, _E_,  _F_.)      The leaves when magnified are seen to be composed of a single layer    of cells, except the midrib, which is made up of several thicknesses    of elongated cells. Where the leaf is one cell thick, the cells are    oblong in form, becoming narrower as they approach the midrib and    the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2040"],[0,"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (#18)"],[1,"of a mighty city--boldly say     A wilderness of building, sinking far     And self-withdrawn into a wondrous depth,     Far sinking into splendour--without end!     Fabric it seem'd of diamond, and of gold,     With alabaster domes, and silver spires,     And blazing terrace upon terrace, high     Uplifted; here, serene pavilions bright     In avenues disposed; there towers begirt     With battlements that on their restless fronts     Bore stars--illumination of all gems!     By earthly nature had the effect been wrought     Upon the dark materials of the storm     Now pacified; on them, and on the coves,     And mountain-steeps and summits, whereunto     The vapours had receded,--taking there     Their station under a cerulean sky.  &c. &c.    The sublime circumstance, \"battlements that on their _restless_ fronts  bore stars,\" might have been copied from my architectural dreams, for it  often occurred.  We hear it reported of Dryden and of Fuseli, in modern  times, that they thought proper to eat raw meat for the sake of obtaining  splendid dreams: how much better for such a purpose to have eaten opium,  which yet I do not remember that any poet is recorded to have done,  except the dramatist Shadwell; and in ancient days Homer is I think  rightly reputed to have known the virtues of opium.    To my architecture succeeded dreams of lakes and silvery expanses of  water: these haunted me so much that I feared (though possibly it will  appear ludicrous to a medical man) that some dropsical state or tendency  of the brain might thus be making itself (to use a metaphysical word)  _objective_; and the sentient organ _project_ itself as its own object.  For two months I suffered greatly in my head, a part of my bodily  structure which had hitherto been so clear from all touch or taint of  weakness (physically I mean) that I used to say of it, as the last Lord  Orford said of his stomach, that it seemed likely to survive the rest of  my person.  Till now I had never felt a headache even, or any the  slightest pain, except rheumatic pains caused by my own folly.  However,  I got over this attack, though it must have been verging on something  very dangerous.    The waters now changed their character--from translucent lakes shining  like mirrors they now became seas and oceans.  And now came a tremendous  change, which, unfolding itself slowly like a scroll through many months,  promised an abiding torment; and in fact it never left me until the  winding up of my case.  Hitherto the human face had mixed often in my  dreams, but not despotically nor with any special power of tormenting.  But now that which I have called the tyranny of the human face began to  unfold itself.  Perhaps some part of my London life might be answerable  for this.  Be that as it may, now it was that upon the rocking waters of  the ocean the human face began to appear; the sea appeared paved with  innumerable faces upturned to the heavens--faces imploring, wrathful,  despairing, surged upwards by thousands, by myriads, by generations, by  centuries: my agitation was infinite; my mind tossed and surged with the  ocean.        May 1818      The Malay has been a fearful enemy for months.  I have been every night,  through his means, transported into Asiatic scenes.  I know not whether  others share in my feelings on this point; but I have often thought that  if I were compelled to forego England, and to live in China, and among  Chinese manners and modes of life and scenery, I should go mad.  The  causes of my horror lie deep, and some of them must be common to others.  Southern Asia in general is the seat of awful images and associations.  As  the cradle of the human race, it would alone have a dim and reverential  feeling connected with it.  But there are other reasons.  No man can  pretend that the wild, barbarous, and capricious superstitions of Africa,  or of savage tribes elsewhere, affect him in the way that he is affected  by the ancient, monumental, cruel, and elaborate religions of Indostan,  &c.  The mere antiquity of Asiatic things, of their institutions,  histories, modes of faith, &c., is so impressive, that to me the vast age  of the race and name overpowers the sense of youth in the individual.  A  young Chinese seems to me an antediluvian man renewed.  Even Englishmen,  though not bred in any knowledge of such institutions, cannot but shudder  at the mystic sublimity of _castes_ that have flowed apart, and refused  to mix, through such immemorial tracts of time; nor can any man fail to  be awed by the names of the Ganges or the Euphrates.  It contributes much  to these feelings that southern Asia is, and has been for thousands of  years, the part of the earth most swarming with human life, the great  _officina gentium_.  Man is a weed in those regions.  The vast empires  also in which the enormous population of Asia has always been cast, give  a further sublimity to the feelings associated with all Oriental names or  images.  In China, over and above what it has in common with the rest of  southern Asia, I am terrified by the modes of life, by the manners, and  the barrier of utter abhorrence and want of sympathy placed between us by  feelings deeper than I can analyse.  I could sooner live with lunatics or  brute animals.  All this, and much more than I can say or have time to  say, the reader must enter into before he can comprehend the unimaginable  horror which these dreams of Oriental imagery and mythological tortures  impressed upon me.  Under the connecting feeling of tropical heat and  vertical sunlights I brought together all creatures, birds, beasts,  reptiles, all trees and plants, usages and appearances, that are found in  all tropical regions, and assembled them together in China or Indostan.  From kindred feelings, I soon brought Egypt and all her gods under the  same law.  I was stared at, hooted at, grinned at, chattered at, by  monkeys, by parroquets, by cockatoos.  I ran into pagodas, and was fixed  for centuries at the summit or in secret rooms: I was the idol; I was the  priest; I was worshipped; I was sacrificed.  I fled from the wrath of  Brama through all the forests of Asia: Vishnu hated me: Seeva laid wait  for me.  I came suddenly upon Isis and Osiris: I had done a deed, they  said, which the ibis and the crocodile trembled at.  I was buried for a  thousand years in stone coffins, with mummies and sphynxes, in narrow  chambers at the heart of eternal pyramids.  I was kissed, with cancerous  kisses, by crocodiles; and laid, confounded with all unutterable slimy  things, amongst reeds and Nilotic mud.    I thus give the reader some slight abstraction of my Oriental dreams,  which always filled me with such amazement at the monstrous scenery that  horror seemed absorbed for a while in sheer astonishment.  Sooner or  later came a reflux of feeling that swallowed up the astonishment, and  left me not so much in terror as in hatred and abomination of what I saw.  Over every form, and threat, and punishment, and dim sightless  incarceration, brooded a sense of eternity and infinity that drove me  into an oppression as of madness.  Into these dreams only it was, with  one or two slight exceptions, that any circumstances of physical horror  entered.  All before had been moral and spiritual terrors.  But here the  main agents were ugly birds, or snakes, or crocodiles; especially the  last.  The cursed crocodile became to me the object of more horror than  almost all the rest.  I was compelled to live with him, and (as was  always the case almost in my dreams) for centuries.  I escaped sometimes,  and found myself in Chinese houses, with cane tables, &c.  All the feet  of the tables, sofas, &c., soon became instinct with life: the abominable  head of the crocodile, and his leering eyes, looked out at me, multiplied  into a thousand repetitions; and I stood loathing and fascinated.  And so  often did this hideous reptile haunt my dreams that many times the very  same dream was broken up in the very same way: I heard gentle voices  speaking to me (I hear everything when I am sleeping), and instantly I  awoke.  It was broad noon, and my children were standing, hand in hand,  at my bedside--come to show me their coloured shoes, or new frocks, or to  let me see them dressed for going out.  I protest that so awful was the  transition from the damned crocodile, and the other unutterable monsters  and abortions of my dreams, to the sight of innocent _human_ natures and  of infancy, that in the mighty and sudden revulsion of mind I wept, and  could not forbear it, as I kissed their faces.        June 1819      I have had occasion to remark, at various periods of my life, that the  deaths of those whom we love, and indeed the contemplation of death  generally, is (_caeteris paribus_) more affecting in summer than in any  other season of the year.  And the reasons are these three, I think:  first, that the visible heavens in summer appear far higher, more  distant, and (if such a solecism may be excused) more infinite; the  clouds, by which chiefly the eye expounds the distance of the blue  pavilion stretched over our heads, are in summer more voluminous, massed  and accumulated in far grander and more towering piles.  Secondly, the  light and the appearances of the declining and the setting sun are much  more fitted to be types and characters of the Infinite.  And thirdly  (which is the main reason), the exuberant and riotous prodigality of life  naturally forces the mind more powerfully upon the antagonist thought of  death, and the wintry sterility of the grave.  For it may be observed  generally, that wherever two thoughts stand related to each other by a  law of antagonism, and exist, as it were, by mutual repulsion, they are  apt to suggest each other.  On these accounts it is that I find it  impossible to banish the thought of death when I am walking alone in the  endless days of summer; and any particular death, "]]]
