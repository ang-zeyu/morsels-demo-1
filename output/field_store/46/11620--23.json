May the blessings of our Almighty Master rest upon your deliberations.    Your true brother,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  January 16, 1925.          Letter of January 29th, 1925.      To the esteemed members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.    My well-beloved and precious fellow-workers:    I have perused your recent communication, dated December 29th, and signed  on your behalf by your vigilant and capable secretary, with an interest  and attention worthy of the paramount importance of the issues it raises.    The matter of the revision of the English version of the Hidden Words, in  view of the rapidity of the sale of the copies recently printed, is of  urgent importance. I shall as soon as my multitudinous preoccupations  permit avail myself of the opportunity of Dr. Esslemont's happy sojourn in  the Holy Land to collaborate with him in any necessary alterations of the  text. I strongly hope, except in the event of unforeseen circumstances, to  undertake this task in the course of this coming month.    In connection with the fundamental questions of general policy referred to  in your letter, I feel that the basic principles, laid down but briefly  stated in my past letters, which must guide the administration of the  affairs of the Baha'i Movement, pending the definite formation of the  first authoritative Universal House of Justice, must be further affirmed,  elucidated, and explained in greater detail, for the complete knowledge of  all the individual members of the vast and growing community of the  believers in America.          The National Convention      Hitherto the National Convention has been primarily called together for  the consideration of the various circumstances attending the election of  the National Spiritual Assembly. I feel, however, that in view of the  expansion and the growing importance of the administrative sphere of the  Cause, the general sentiments and tendencies prevailing among the friends,  and the signs of increasing interdependence among the National Spiritual  Assemblies throughout the world, the assembled accredited representatives  of the American believers should exercise not only the vital and  responsible right of electing the National Assembly, but should also  fulfill the functions of an enlightened, consultative and cooperative body  that will enrich the experience, enhance the prestige, support the  authority, and assist the deliberations of the National Spiritual  Assembly. It is my firm conviction that it is the bounden duty, in the  interest of the Cause we all love and serve, of the members of the  incoming National Assembly, once elected by the delegates at Convention  time, to seek and have the utmost regard, individually as well as  collectively, for the advice, the considered opinion and the true  sentiments of the assembled delegates. Banishing every vestige of secrecy,  of undue reticence, of dictatorial aloofness, from their midst, they  should radiantly and abundantly unfold to the eyes of the delegates, by  whom they are elected, their plans, their hopes, and their cares. They  should familiarize the delegates with the various matters that will have  to be considered in the current year, and calmly and conscientiously study  and weigh the opinions and judgments of the delegates. The newly elected  National Assembly, during the few days when the Convention is in session  and after the dispersal of the delegates, should seek ways and means to  cultivate understanding, facilitate and maintain the exchange of views,  deepen confidence, and vindicate by every tangible evidence their one  desire to serve and advance the common weal. Not infrequently, nay  oftentimes, the most lowly, untutored and inexperienced among the friends  will, by the sheer inspiring force of selfless and ardent devotion,  contribute a distinct and memorable share to a highly involved discussion  in any given Assembly. Great must be the regard paid by those whom the  delegates call upon to serve in high position to this all-important though  inconspicuous manifestation of the revealing power of sincere and earnest  devotion.          National Spiritual Assembly      The National Spiritual Assembly, however, in view of the unavoidable  limitations imposed upon the convening of frequent and long-standing  sessions of the Convention, will have to retain in its hands the final  decision on all matters that affect the interests of the Cause in America,  such as the right to decide whether any local Assembly is functioning in  accordance with the principles laid down for the conduct and the  advancement of the Cause. It is my earnest prayer that they will utilize  their highly responsible position, not only for the wise and efficient  conduct of the affairs of the Cause, but also for the extension and  deepening of the spirit of cordiality and wholehearted and mutual support  in their cooperation with the body of their co-workers throughout the  land. The seating of delegates to the Convention, i.e., the right to  decide upon the validity of the credentials of the delegates at a given  Convention, is vested in the outgoing National Assembly, and the right to  decide who has the voting privilege is also ultimately placed in the hands  of the National Spiritual Assembly, either when a local Spiritual Assembly  is for the first time being formed in a given locality, or when  differences arise between a new applicant and an already established local  Assembly. While the Convention is in session and the accredited delegates  have already elected from among the believers throughout the country the  members of the National Spiritual Assembly for the current year, it is of  infinite value and a supreme necessity that as far as possible all matters  requiring immediate decision should be fully and publicly considered, and  an endeavor be made to obtain after mature deliberation, unanimity in  vital decisions. Indeed, it has ever been the cherished desire of our  Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha, that the friends in their councils, local as well as  national, should by their candor, their honesty of purpose, their  singleness of mind, and the thoroughness of their discussions, achieve  unanimity in all things. Should this in certain cases prove impracticable  the verdict of the majority should prevail, to which decision the minority  must under all circumstances, gladly, spontaneously and continually,  submit.    Nothing short of the all-encompassing, all-pervading power of His Guidance  and Love can enable this newly-enfolded order to gather strength and  flourish amid the storm and stress of a turbulent age, and in the fulness  of time vindicate its high claim to be universally recognized as the one  Haven of abiding felicity and peace.    Regarding the pamphlet entitled \"The Passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha,\" I believe  some additional material, consisting mainly of a few selections from  leading American newspapers, would increase its value and extend its  scope. I shall be glad to receive a copy of the reprinted edition, and I  wish you success in this endeavor.    My dearly-beloved friend and fellow-worker, Mr. Mountfort Mills, is now  with me in Haifa, and will ere long join you in the discharge of your  manifold and arduous duties. I greatly value his assistance in the  difficult task and the complex and often urgent problems that are before  me, and I trust that his return to America will lend a fresh impetus to  the glorious work of service you are rendering to the Cause of  Baha'u'llah.    I wish you success from all my heart.    Your brother and fellow-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  January 29th, 1925.          Letter of April 10th, 1925.      To the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.    My dearly-beloved fellow-workers:    The communications lately received from your distinguished secretary,  dated January 8th, February 6th and 13th, and March 17th, together with  the enclosed minutes, reports and letters, have been read with profound  interest and genuine satisfaction. The methods you pursue, the new  measures for publicity which you have adopted, the increasing confidence  you have achieved, and the degree of support, both moral and financial,  which you have deservedly earned from the body of the believers are all  encouraging signs that testify to the growing solidarity of a Cause  destined to confer inestimable benefits upon mankind.    Great as is the promise of the Movement for the future, it has already  revealed in a remarkable manner to every unprejudiced observer its  indomitable spirit of loving sacrifice and true fellowship burning with  undiminished ardor in the breasts of its followers both in the land of its  birth and in the great Republic of the West. The heroism and fortitude  lately displayed by its sorely-tried adherents in Persia, and the prompt  and generous contributions of the American believers who have  spontaneously responded to the call of their needy brethren of the East  have served to kindle the flame of enthusiasm in many a heart, and forged  fresh bonds of fellowship which will prove of the highest value for the  advancement of the Baha'i Faith. I would specially request you to convey  to all the friends in the name of the oppressed Baha'is of Persia, and  particularly the homeless sufferers of Nayriz, the expression of their  deepest gratitude and highest appreciation. May America's noble donations  draw even as a magnet the blessings of the Almighty Giver upon the task it  has set itself to achieve!    I am delighted to learn of the evidences of growing interest, of the  sympathetic understanding, and brotherly cooperation on the part of two  capable and steadfast servants of the One True God, Dr. H. Randall and Dr.  Guthrie, whose participation in our work I hope and pray will widen the  scope of our activities, enrich our opportunities, and lend a fresh"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#18)"],[1,"of the Plan, eager to witness its  consummation, can afford to ignore for a moment.    The sacrifice demanded is such as to have no parallel whatsoever in the  history of that community. The manifold issues inextricably interwoven  with the campaign audaciously launched for the achievement of this high  objective are of such a weighty character as to overshadow every  enterprise embarked upon through the organized efforts of its members, in  either the concluding years of the Heroic Age of the Faith or the first  epoch of the Age which succeeded it. The two years during which this  emergency will be most keenly felt coincide on the one hand with a period  of increasing distraction occasioned by the uncertainties, the perils and  fears of a steadily worsening international situation, and on the other  with the centenary of one of the most turbulent, afflictive and glorious  stages of Baha'i history--a stage immortalized by an effusion of blood, a  self-abnegation, a heroism unsurpassed not only in the annals of the Faith  but in the world's spiritual history. How meritorious, indeed, are the  self-denying acts which this supremely challenging hour now calls forth,  amidst the perplexities and confusion which present-day society is now  experiencing! And yet, how trifling in comparison with the self-immolation  of the most distinguished, the most precious heroes and saints of the  Primitive Age of our glorious Faith! An outpouring of treasure, no less  copious than the blood shed so lavishly in the Apostolic Age of the Faith  by those who in the heart of the Asiatic continent proclaimed its birth to  the world, can befit their spiritual descendants, who, in the present  Formative Age of the Baha'i Dispensation, have championed the Cause, and  assumed so preponderating a share in the erection of its Administrative  Order, and are now engaged in the final stage of the building of the House  that incarnates the soul of that Faith in the American continent. No  sacrifice can be deemed too great to insure the completion of such an  edifice--the most holy House of Worship ever to be associated with the  Faith of the Most Great Name--an edifice whose inception has shed such a  luster on the closing years of the Heroic Age of the Baha'i Dispensation,  which has assumed a concrete shape in the present Formative stage in the  evolution of our beloved Faith, whose dependencies must spring into  existence in the course of successive epochs of this same Age, and whose  fairest fruits will be garnered in the Age that is to come, the last, the  Golden Age of the initial and brightest Dispensation of the  five-thousand-century Baha'i Cycle.    \"A most wonderful and thrilling motion will appear in the world of  existence,\" are 'Abdu'l-Baha's own words, predicting the release of  spiritual forces that must accompany the completion of this most hallowed  House of Worship. \"From that point of light,\" He, further glorifying that  edifice, has written, \"the spirit of teaching ... will permeate to all  parts of the world.\" And again: \"Out of this Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar,  without doubt, thousands of Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kars will be born.\" \"It  marks the inception of the Kingdom of God on earth.\"    Again I repeat--and I cannot overrate the vital, the unique importance of  the campaign now launched to insure the completion of such an edifice--the  immediate destiny of the American Baha'i Community is intimately and  inescapably bound up with the outcome of this newly launched, this  severely trying, soul-purging, spiritually uplifting campaign. The  God-given mission, constituting the birthright, and proclaiming the  primacy of a community whose members the Founder of that community, the  Center of the Covenant Himself, has addressed as the \"Apostles of  Baha'u'llah,\" can only be fulfilled if they befittingly obey the specific  Mandate issued by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablets of the Divine Plan. The  execution of this Mandate is, in its turn, dependent upon the triumphant  conclusion of the Second Seven Year Plan, the second stage in the series  of specific plans formulated to insure the successful termination of the  opening phase in the execution of that Mandate. Indeed, the successive  plans, inaugurated since the birth of the second Baha'i century, by the  British, the Indian, the Persian, the Australia-New Zealand, the Iraqi,  the German and the Egyptian National Assemblies, with the exception of the  plan undertaken by the Canadian National Assembly, which forms an integral  part of the Plan associated with the Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha, are but  supplements to the vast enterprise whose features have been delineated in  those Tablets and are to be regarded, by their very nature, as regional in  scope, in contrast with the world-embracing character of the mission  entrusted to the community of the champion builders of the World Order of  Baha'u'llah, and the torch-bearers of the civilization which that Order  must eventually establish. As to the Second Seven Year Plan itself, its  eventual success must depend on the attainment of its second and most  vital objective. This objective, in its turn, cannot be achieved unless  the two-year campaign, now launched by the elected representatives of this  community, is successfully carried out. Nor can this campaign yield its  richest fruit unless and until the community, in its entirety,  participates in this nation-wide sacrificial effort. Nor can this  collective effort be blessed, to the fullest extent possible, unless the  contributions made by its members involve acts of self-abnegation, not  only on the part of those of modest means, but also by those endowed with  substantial resources. Nor, indeed, can these self-denying acts, by both  the rich and the poor, be productive of the fullest possible benefit  unless this sacrificial effort is neither momentary nor haphazard, but  rather systematic and continuous throughout the period of the present  emergency.    Then and only then will this holy edifice, symbol and harbinger of a world  civilization as yet unborn, and the embodiment of the sacrifice of a  multitude of the upholders of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, release the full  measure of the regenerative power with which it has been endowed, shed in  all its plenitude the glory of the Most Holy Spirit dwelling within it,  and vindicate, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the truth of every single  promise recorded by the pen of 'Abdu'l-Baha pertaining to its destiny.    No more befitting consummation for this magnificent enterprise can be  envisaged than that this noble edifice, whose cornerstone has been laid by  'Abdu'l-Baha's own hands, the preliminary measure for whose construction  synchronized with the formal interment of the Bab's remains on Mt. Carmel,  within whose walls the first Centenary of the birth of His ministry has  been celebrated, whose interior ornamentation has coincided with the  construction of the arcade of His Sepulcher, should be vouchsafed the  honor of having the Jubilee of its inception coincide with, and celebrated  on the occasion of, the Centenary of the birth of Baha'u'llah's prophetic  Mission in the Siyah-_Ch_al of Tihran.    [April 11, 1949]            PROCESS OF EXPANSION ACCELERATES  [MESSAGE TO 1949 CONVENTION]      Desire to share with attendants at Forty-first American Baha'i Convention  feelings of joyous gratitude evoked by the steady acceleration of the dual  process of expansion and consolidation of the Baha'i World Community as  well as the perspicuous evidences of divine protection vouchsafed the  World Center of the Faith during the course of the third year of the  Second Seven Year Plan. The number of countries included within the pale  of the Faith is ninety-four. Languages into which Baha'i literature is  translated, and assemblies, local and national, incorporated, now total  fifty-six and one hundred five, respectively. Baha'i literature now being  translated into fourteen additional languages. The number of centers in  Latin America is one hundred and nine. The fourth objective of the present  Plan has been achieved four years ahead of schedule through the formation  of a spiritual assembly in each of the ten goal countries on the European  continent. Centers established in these countries total thirty-one, newly  enrolled native believers, one hundred fifty-four. Nearly a million dollar  drive to complete the Mother Temple of the West has been auspiciously  launched and construction of interior sections of the ornamentation  initiated. Number of settlements in Greenland provided with Baha'i  scriptures raised to forty-eight, including Thule beyond the Arctic Circle  and Etah near eightieth latitude. Number of American states, territories  and federal districts recognizing Baha'i marriage raised to eighteen.  Restoration of the newly acquired German national Haziratu'l-Quds at  Frankfurt has been commenced. Formulation of five year plans for German  and Egyptian National Assemblies, culminating at the Centenary of the  Birth of Baha'u'llah's prophetic Mission, completes the number of national  assemblies pledged to achieve within appointed time specified goals in  five continents. The European Teaching Conference convened at Geneva  inaugurating series of annual gatherings designed to consolidate the  tremendously significant transatlantic project. Baha'i observers  accredited by United Nations participated in Conference on Human Rights,  Geneva; United Nations General Assembly, Paris. Baha'i representative  attended Luxembourg general conference of world movement for world  federation. First all red Indian Assembly consolidated at Macy, Nebraska.  Building operations on arcade of Bab's Sepulcher commenced forty years  after official interment of His remains by 'Abdu'l-Baha. Prolonged  hostilities ravaging Holy Land providentially terminated. Baha'i holy  places, unlike those belonging to other faiths, miraculously safeguarded.  Perils "]]]
