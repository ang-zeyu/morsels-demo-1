As I have said in  another place:    \"In my opinion, stigmatizing even the most moderate indulgence in  masturbation as a vice has a deleterious effect upon the people who so  indulge and makes it harder for them to break off the habit. Every  thinking physician and sexologist can tell you that picturing the  masturbatory habit in too lurid colors and stigmatizing it with too  strong epithets has, as a rule, the contrary effect to the one  expected. The victims of the habit consider themselves degraded,  irretrievably lost. They lose their self-respect, and it is, on  account of that, harder for them to break themselves of the habit.\"    We shall accomplish a good deal more with our youthful and older  patients if we leave alone, altogether, the moral side of the  question--if there be any moral side to it--and emphasize the physical  injuriousness of the habit. We do not want to diminish the  self-respect of our boys and girls, we want to increase it; and we can  not do this if we make them believe that a masturbator is a vicious  criminal. Inspire your patients with confidence, tell them that  indulgence in the habit jeopardizes their future growth, both physical  and mental, their health and happiness, and you will find them easier  to control.    I am not trying to minimize the danger of masturbation, for, if  indulged in from an early age and to great excess, the results _may_  be disastrous. But, even if I were to minimize the evil consequences,  that would be less of a sin than to exaggerate them the way it has  been done for so many years, by so many people in the profession and  out of it. The evil results of exaggerating the influence of  masturbation have been so great in the past that, if now the pendulum  were to swing to the other extreme, I am sure it would not be a bad  thing at all.    To deal with the subject of the _treatment_ of masturbation belongs to  a medical treatise. But, a few remarks on how to prevent children from  acquiring the habit of masturbation will not be out of place.    =Prevention of the Habit of Masturbation.= The keynote of preventing  the habit is, carefully to watch the child from its earliest infancy.  We know that not infrequently stupid or vicious nursemaids,  wet-nurses, and even governesses ignorantly or deliberately induce the  habit in children under their charge. This, of course, must be  prevented. Even children of the age of nine, ten, eleven years should  not be left alone, but always be under supervision. Too close  friendship between boys or girls, particularly of different ages,  should be looked upon with suspicion.    A number of girls never should sleep in the same room without  supervision by an older person.    The sleeping together of two in the same bed, whether it be two  children or a grown person and a child, should not be permitted under  any circumstances. I admit of no exceptions to this demand. It makes  no difference whether the other person is a mother, a father, a  brother or a sister. Leaving out of the question any _deliberate_  element, the thing is dangerous; for, very often, unintentionally,  unwittingly, masturbation is initiated by this intimate contact.    The child--boy or girl--should sleep alone, on a rather hard mattress.  The covering should be light. A coverlet may be put over the feet. The  child always should sleep with the arms out upon the cover or blanket,  never _under_ the same. If this is done from childhood on, it is very  easy to get used to this way of sleeping, and many a case of  masturbation will thus be obviated. The child should not be permitted  to loll in bed: it must be taught to get up as soon as it awakes in  the morning. The general bringing-up must be of a strengthening,  hardening character; and this applies both to the body and the will.  When the children reach the age of nine, ten, eleven, twelve or  thirteen years (we must use discrimination and judgment, for, some  children of nine are as developed as are others of thirteen), we must  tell them that it is bad and injurious to handle one's genitals, and  we must warn them to shun any companions who wish to initiate them  into any manipulations of these parts or who show an inclination to  talk about the sexual organs and sex matters.    Hot baths are very injurious for young children in their influence in  this direction. There is no question that a hot bath has a very  decided stimulating effect upon the sexual desire of adults as well as  of children, both male and female; in fact, I have had several  patients of either sex tell me that their first masturbatory act was  committed while they were in a hot bath. Of course, the sensation  having been pleasurable, they kept on repeating the experience.    Every factor liable to give rise to the habit should be removed. Thus,  for instance, eczema about the genitals, strongly acid urine,  seatworms, and the like, should be treated until cured. That anything  having a tendency prematurely to awaken the sexual instinct should be  rigorously avoided, goes without saying.    =Mental or Psychic Masturbation.= Some girls and women will abstain  from handling themselves with their hands (manual masturbation), but  will practice what we call mental masturbation. That is, they will  concentrate their minds on the opposite sex, will picture to  themselves various lascivious scenes, until they feel \"satisfied.\"  This method is extremely injurious and exhausting and is very likely  to lead to neurasthenia and a nervous breakdown. You should break  yourself of it, by all means, if you can. For it is even more  injurious than the regular habit.          CHAPTER TWENTY    LEUCORRHEA--THE WHITES     Misconception Regarding the Meaning of the Term \"Leucorrhea\"--A    Common Complaint--Severe Cases--Reasons for Resistance to    Treatment--Proper Local Treatment of the Disorder--Sterility Due    to Leucorrhea--Causes of Leucorrhea--Tonic Medicines--Local    Treatment--Formulae for Douching.      Leucorrhea means literally a \"white running,\" and is applied by the  laity to any whitish discharge coming from the vagina. This is wrong,  because some white discharges may be of little importance; others may  be of a serious character, and not be leucorrhea at all.    Leucorrhea is one of the banes of the modern girl and woman. It is  very frequent. Probably at least twenty-five per cent, (some say fifty  or seventy-five per cent.) of all women suffer with it in a greater or  lesser degree. In some cases it is only an annoyance, necessitating  the frequent changing of napkins, but in others it causes a great deal  of weakness, backache, erosions, itching and burning. It is very  resistant to treatment, particularly in girls. The reason it is so  resistant to treatment is because the discharge, while coming from  the vagina, _does not usually originate_ in the vagina; it originates  in the neck of the womb, and the hundreds and hundreds of injections  that women take for their leucorrhea only reach the vagina; they  cannot penetrate into the womb. And it is only by treating the cavity  of the cervix, which can only be done by a physician, through a  speculum, that the root of the trouble can be reached. And, if any  erosion or ulcer is noticed, it can be directly touched up with the  necessary application. And it is for this reason that in girls  leucorrhea is so much more difficult to treat. For fear of having the  hymen ruptured the girl objects to a thorough examination and to local  treatment, and the leucorrhea is permitted to proceed until perhaps a  chronic inflammation of the womb and the Fallopian tubes is  established. There is no doubt that many cases of sterility or  childlessness in women are due to long-neglected leucorrhea in  girlhood.    =What Is the Cause of Leucorrhea?= We can answer simply: the cause of  leucorrhea is catarrh in any part of the female genital tract. But  this is no real answer. What are the causes of the catarrh? The causes  of catarrh are many: the most common cause is a cold. Wetting the feet  and getting chilled, particularly during the menses, may set up a  catarrh in the cervix. Long standing on one's feet, lifting and  carrying heavy bundles, dancing in overheated rooms and then going out  scantily clad in the chill night air, prolonged ungratified sexual  excitement, lack of cleanliness in the external genitals--all these  are factors in setting up a catarrh of the cervix with a resultant  leucorrhea. A general rundown condition, worry, overwork, too hard  study, lack of fresh air, and a general scrofulous condition also  favor the development of catarrh of the womb and leucorrhea. It will  therefore be seen that the treatment of leucorrhea to be successful  must be general and local.    =General Treatment.= The general treatment consists in general  hygienic measures and in common sense. The patient should not be on  her feet more than she can help, and she should not walk until  exhausted or fatigued. It is better to take several short walks than  one long one. The corset she wears, if she wears any at all, should be  of the modern kind: not one that presses the womb and the other  abdominal organs down, but one that supports the abdominal walls, and  rather raises the abdominal organs up. The lacing or buttoning must be  from below up, and not from above down. That it should not in any way  interfere with the freedom of respiration goes without saying.  Constipation if any, to be treated, must be treated intelligently, by  mild measures (see Constipation, in the chapter on pregnancy), and  care must be taken that the bowels move at regular hours.

Its designs, and those of the medals awarded to  General Horatio Gates for Saratoga, General Nathaniel Greene for Eutaw  Springs, General Daniel Morgan, Lieutenant-Colonels William Augustine  Washington and John Eager Howard for the Cowpens, General Anthony  Wayne and Major John Stewart for Stony Point, and Captain John Paul  Jones for the capture of the Serapis, were composed by commissioners  appointed by the French Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, at  the request of Colonel David Humphreys and of Mr. Jefferson. The  legend of the reverse of the General Washington medal, as originally  proposed, was HOSTIBUS or ANGLIS PRIMUM FUGATIS. Several of the medals  are treated of at length in the Introduction, to which, to avoid  repetition, the reader is referred.      PIERRE SIMON DUVIVIER was born in Paris, November 5, 1731. He was the  son of Jean Duvivier, a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and  Sculpture, and the grandson of Jean Duvivier, known as Duvivier \"_le  pere_,\" the first of this distinguished family of medal engravers, who  lived in Liege at the beginning of the 17th century. Pierre Simon  Duvivier was engraver-general of the Paris Mint prior to 1793, and  executed medals of many eminent persons. America is indebted to him  for those of General Washington, Lieutenant-Colonel de Fleury,  Lieutenant-Colonel William Augustine Washington, and Lieutenant-Colonel  John Eager Howard. He was a member of the Academy of Fine Arts, and  died June 10, 1819.      GEORGE WASHINGTON was born near Pope's Creek, Westmoreland County,  Virginia, February 22, 1732. He lost his father when but ten years of  age, and in 1752, in consequence of the death of his elder brother,  came into possession of the estate of Mount Vernon, on the Potomac  River, and other property. The same year he received a commission as  major of militia, and in 1755 became colonel and aid-de-camp to    (p. 003)  General Braddock. On the death of that officer in the disastrous march  against Fort Duquesne, Washington conducted the retreat, and was  shortly afterward appointed commander of the Virginia troops. In 1774  he was elected member of the first Continental Congress, held in  Philadelphia, and in the following year was appointed commander-in-chief  of the Continental Army, taking command of the forces at Cambridge,  July 3, 1775. On March 17, 1776, he compelled the British forces to  evacuate Boston, for which Congress gave him a vote of thanks and a  gold medal. He was commander-in-chief throughout the War of  Independence, and resigned his commission as such, December 23, 1783,  when he retired to Mount Vernon. He was delegate from Virginia to the  National Convention which met in Philadelphia in May, 1787, to frame  the Constitution of the United States, and was chosen its president.  He was afterward unanimously elected first President of the United  States, and was inaugurated in New York city, April 30, 1789. He was  re-elected, and inaugurated a second time, March 4, 1793; refused a  third term of office, and issued a farewell address, September 17,  1796. When a war with France was expected, in 1797, he was  re-appointed commander-in-chief. General Washington died at Mount  Vernon, December 14, 1799.                                  _____    ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS.    _Resolution of Congress Voting a Medal to General Washington._    IN CONGRESS.         _Resolved_, That the thanks of this Congress, in their own name,       and in the name of the thirteen United Colonies, whom they       represent, be presented to His Excellency General Washington, and       the officers and soldiers under his command, for their wise and       spirited conduct in the siege and acquisition of Boston; and that       a medal of gold be struck in commemoration of this great event,       and presented to His Excellency; and that a committee of       three[28] be appointed to prepare a letter of thanks and a proper       device for the medal.

March 19, 1776.         Sir: It is with the greatest pleasure I inform you that, on       Sunday last, the seventeenth instant, about nine o'clock in the       forenoon, the ministerial army evacuated the town of Boston, and       that the forces of the United Colonies are now in actual       possession thereof. I beg leave to congratulate you, Sir, and the       honourable Congress, on this happy event, and particularly as it       was effected without endangering the lives and property of the       remaining unhappy inhabitants.         I have great reason to imagine their flight was precipitated by       the appearance of a work which I had ordered to be thrown up last       Saturday night on an eminence at Dorchester, which lay nearest to       Boston Neck, called Nook's Hill.         The town, although it has suffered greatly, is not in so bad a       state as I expected to find it; and I have a particular pleasure       in being able to inform you, Sir, that your house has received no       damage worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order,       and the family pictures are all left entire and untouched.       Captain Cazeneau takes charge of the whole until he shall receive       further"]]]
