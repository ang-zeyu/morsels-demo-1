They rang the bell and began to batter at the  door and windows. The witness' wife went to the door and two or three  Germans came in. The family were ordered out into the street. There they  found another family, and the two families were driven with their hands  above their heads along the Rue Grande. All the houses in the street  were burning.    \"The party was eventually put into a forge where there were a number of  other prisoners, about a hundred in all, and were kept there from 11 A.  M. till 2 P. M. They were then taken to the prison. There they were  assembled in a courtyard and searched. No arms were found. They were  then passed through into the prison itself and put into cells. The  witness and his wife were separated from each other. During the next  hour the witness heard rifle shots continually and noticed in the corner  of a courtyard leading off the row of cells the body of a young man with  a mantle thrown over it. He recognized the mantle as having belonged to  his wife. The witness' daughter was allowed to go out to see what had  happened to her mother, and the witness himself was allowed to go across  the courtyard half an hour afterward for the same purpose. He found his  wife lying on the floor in a room. She had bullet wounds in four places  but was alive and told her husband to return to the children and he did  so.    \"About 5 o'clock in the evening, he saw the Germans bringing out all the  young and middle-aged men from the cells, and ranging their prisoners,  to the number of forty, in three rows in the middle of the courtyard.  About twenty Germans were drawn up opposite, but before anything was  done there was a tremendous fusillade from some point near the prison  and the civilians were hurried back to their cells. Half an hour later  the same forty men were brought back into the courtyard. Almost  immediately there was a second fusillade and they were driven back to  the cells again.    \"About 7 o'clock the witness and other prisoners were brought out of  their cells and marched out of the prison. They went between two lines  of troops to Roche Bayard, about a kilometer away. An hour later the  women and children were separated and the prisoners were brought back to  Dinant passing the prison on their way. Just outside the prison, the  witness saw three lines of bodies which he recognized as being those of  his neighbors. They were nearly all dead, but he noticed movement in  some of them. There were about one hundred and twenty bodies. The  prisoners were then taken up to the top of a hill outside Dinant and  compelled to stay there till 8 o'clock in the morning. On the following  day they were put into cattle trucks and taken thence to Coblenz. For  three months they remained prisoners in Germany.    \"Unarmed civilians were killed in masses at other places near the  prison. About ninety bodies were seen lying on the top of one another in  a grass square opposite the convent. A witness asked a German officer  why her husband had been shot, and he told her that it was because two  of her sons had been in the civil guard and had shot at the Germans. As  a matter of fact, one of her sons was at that time in Liege and the  other in Brussels. It is stated that besides the ninety corpses referred  to above, sixty corpses of civilians were recovered from a hole in the  brewery yard and that forty-eight bodies of women and children were  found in a garden. The town was systematically set on fire by hand  grenades. Another witness saw a little girl of seven, one of whose legs  was broken and the other injured by a bayonet. We have no reason to  believe that the civilian population of Dinant gave any provocation, or  that any other defense can be put forward to justify the treatment  inflicted upon its citizens.\"      The Bryce Commission reports the outrages in a number of Belgian  villages in this terse fashion:      \"In Hofstade a number of houses had been set on fire and many corpses  were seen, some in houses, some in back yards, and some in the streets.  Two witnesses speak of having seen the body of a young man pierced by  bayonet thrusts with the wrists cut also. On a side road the corpse of a  civilian was seen on his doorstep with a bayonet wound in his stomach  and by his side the dead body of a boy of five or six with his hands  nearly severed. The corpses of a woman and boy were seen at the  blacksmith's. They had been killed with the bayonet. In a cafe, a young  man, also killed with the bayonet, was holding his hands together as if  in the attitude of supplication.    \"In the garden of a house in the main street, bodies of two women were  observed, and in another house, the body of a boy of sixteen with two  bayonet wounds in the chest. In Sempst a similar condition of affairs  existed. Houses were burning and in some of them were the charred  remains of civilians. In a bicycle shop a witness saw the burned corpse  of a man. Other witnesses speak of this incident. Another civilian,  unarmed, was shot as he was running away. As will be remembered, all the  arms had been given up some time before by the order of the burgomaster.    \"At Weerde four corpses of civilians were lying in the road. It was said  that these men had fired upon the German soldiers; but this is denied.  The arms had been given up long before. Two children were killed in the  village of Weerde, quite wantonly as they were standing in the road with  their mother. They were three or four years old and were killed with the  bayonet. A small barn burning close by formed a convenient means of  getting rid of bodies. They were thrown into the flames from the  bayonets. It is right to add that no commissioned officer was present at  the time. At Eppeghem, on August 25th, a pregnant woman who had been  wounded with a bayonet was discovered in the convent. She was dying. On  the road six dead bodies of laborers were seen.    \"At Boortmeerbeek a German soldier was seen to fire three times at a  little girl five years old. Having failed to hit her, he subsequently  bayoneted her. He was killed with the butt end of a rifle by a Belgian  soldier who had seen him commit this murder from a distance. At Herent  the charred body of a civilian was found in a butcher's shop, and in a  handcart twenty yards away was the dead body of a laborer. Two eye  witnesses relate that a German soldier shot a civilian and stabbed him  with a bayonet as he lay. He then made one of these witnesses, a  civilian prisoner, smell the blood on the bayonet. At Haecht the bodies  of ten civilians were seen lying in a row by a brewery wall. In a  laborer's house, which had been broken up, the mutilated corpse of a  woman of thirty to thirty-five was discovered.\"    Concerning the treatment of women and children in general, the report  continues: \"The evidence shows that the German authorities, when  carrying out a policy of systematic arson and plunder in selected  districts, usually drew some distinction between the adult male  population on the one hand and the women and children on the other. It  was a frequent practice to set apart the adult males of the condemned  district with a view to the execution of a suitable number--preferably  of the younger and more vigorous--and to reserve the women and children  for milder treatment. The depositions, however, present many instances  of calculated cruelty, often going the length of murder, toward the  women and children of the condemned area.    \"At Dinant sixty women and children were confined in the cellar of a  convent from Sunday morning till the following Friday, August 28th,  sleeping on the ground, for there were no beds, with nothing to drink  during the whole period, and given no food until Wednesday, when  somebody threw into the cellar two sticks of macaroni and a carrot for  each prisoner. In other cases the women and children were marched for  long distances along roads, as, for instance, the march of the women  from Louvain to Tirlemont, August 28th, the laggards pricked on by the  attendant Uhlans. A lady complains of having been brutally kicked by  privates. Others were struck at with the butt end of rifles. At Louvain,  at Liege, at Aerschot, at Malines, at Montigny, at Andenne, and  elsewhere, there is evidence that the troops were not restrained from  drunkenness, and drunken soldiers cannot be trusted to observe the rules  or decencies of war, least of all when they are called upon to execute a  preordained plan of arson and pillage. From the very first women were  not safe. At Liege women and children were chased about the streets by  soldiers.    \"Witnesses recount how a great crowd of men, women and children from  Aerschot were marched to Louvain, and then suddenly exposed to a fire  from a mitrailleuse and rifles. 'We were all placed,' recounts a  sufferer, 'in Station Street, Louvain, and the German soldiers fired on  us. I saw the corpses of some women in the street. I fell down, and a  woman who had been shot fell on top of me.' Women and children suddenly  turned out into the streets, and, compelled to witness the destruction  of their homes by fire, provided a sad spectacle to such as were sober  enough to see.    \"A humane German officer, witnessing the ruin of Aerschot, exclaimed in  disgust: 'I am a father myself, and I cannot bear this. It is not war  but butchery.' Officers as well as men succumbed to the temptation of  drink, with results which may be illustrated by an incident which  occurred at Campenhout. In this village there was a certain well-to-do  merchant (name given) who had a cellar of good champagne. On the  afternoon of the 14th or 15th of August three German cavalry officers  entered the house and demanded champagne. Having drunk ten bottles and  invited five or six officers and three or four private soldiers to join  them, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19031"],[0,"A Treatise on Adulterations of Food, and Culinary Poisons (#18)"],[1,"OF BEER.    The detection of the adulteration of beer with deleterious vegetable  substances is beyond the reach of chemical analysis. The presence of  sulphate of iron (p. 134) may be detected by evaporating the beer to  perfect dryness, and burning away the vegetable matter obtained, by the  action of chlorate of pot-ash in a red-hot crucible. The sulphate of  iron will be left behind among the residue in the crucible, which when  dissolved in water, may be assayed, for the constituent parts of the  salt, namely, iron and sulphuric acid: for the former, by tincture of  galls, ammonia, and prussiate of potash; and for the latter, by muriate  of barytes.[80]    Beer, which has been rendered fraudulently _hard_ (see p. 148) by the  admixture of sulphuric acid, affords a white precipitate (sulphate of  barytes), by dropping into it a solution of acetate or muriate of  barytes; and this precipitate, when collected by filtering the mass, and  after having been dried, and heated red-hot for a few minutes in a  platina crucible, does not disappear by the addition of nitric, or  muriatic acid. Genuine old beer may produce a precipitate; but the  precipitate which it affords, after having been made red-hot in a  platina crucible, instantly becomes re-dissolved with effervescence by  pouring on it some pure nitric or muriatic acid; in that case the  precipitate is malate (not sulphate) of barytes, and is owing to a  portion of malic acid having been formed in the beer.    But with regard to the vegetable materials deleterious to health, it is  extremely difficult, in any instance, to detect them by chemical  agencies; and in most cases it is quite impossible, as in that of  cocculus indicus in beer.      METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE QUANTITY OF SPIRIT CONTAINED IN PORTER, ALE,  OR OTHER KINDS OF MALT LIQUORS.    Take any quantity of the beer, put it into a glass retort, furnished  with a receiver, and distil, with a gentle heat, as long as any spirit  passes over into the receiver; which may be known by heating from time  to time a small quantity of the obtained fluid in a tea-spoon over a  candle, and bringing into contact with the vapour of it the flame of a  piece of paper. If the vapour of the distilled fluid catches fire, the  distillation must be continued until the vapour ceases to be set on  fire by the contact of a flaming body. To the distilled liquid thus  obtained, which is the spirit of the beer, combined with water, add, in  small quantities at a time, pure subcarbonate of potash (previously  freed from water by having been exposed to a red heat,) till the last  portion of this salt added, remains undissolved in the fluid. The spirit  will thus become separated from the water, because the subcarbonate of  potash abstracts from it the whole of the water which it contained; and  this combination sinks to the bottom, and the spirit alone floats on the  top. If this experiment be made in a glass tube, about half or  three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and graduated into 50 or 100  equal parts, the relative per centage of spirit in a given quantity of  beer may be seen by mere inspection.      _Quantity of Alcohol contained in Porter, Ale, and other kinds of Malt  Liquors._[81]         One hundred parts, by Measure,      Parts of Alcohol,            contained.                        by Measure.

In proof of this  statement, it is only necessary to consult the London newspapers (the  Times and the Courier) from March to July 1818; which show to what  extent this nefarious traffic has been carried on; and they report also  the prosecutions and convictions of numerous individuals who have been  guilty of the fraud. The following are some of those prosecutions and  convictions.    HATTON GARDEN.--On Saturday an information came to be heard at  this office, before Thomas Leach, Esq. the sitting magistrate, against a  man of the name of Edmund Rhodes, charged with having, on the 12th of  August last, dyed, fabricated, and manufactured, divers large  quantities, viz. one hundred weight of sloe leaves, one hundred weight  of ash leaves, one hundred weight of elder leaves, and one hundred  weight of the leaves of a certain other tree, in imitation of tea,  contrary to the statute of the 17th of Geo. III.[85] whereby the said  Edmund Rhodes had, for every pound of such leaves so manufactured,  forfeited the sum of 5_l._ making the total of the penalties amount to  2,000_l._ The second count in the information charged the said Rhodes  with having in his possession the above quantity of sloe, ash, elder,  and other leaves, under the like penalty of 2,000_l._ The third count  charged him with having, on the said 12th of August last, in his  possession, divers quantities, exceeding six pounds weight of each  respective kind of leaves; viz. fifty pounds weight of green sloe  leaves,"]]]
