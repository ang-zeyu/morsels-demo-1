Shivering slightly, Soames picked up the bag and began to walk back.  Less than half-way along, an icy chill entered into his veins, and his  nerves quivered like piano wires, for a soft crying of his name came,  eerie, through the silence, and terrified the hearer.    \"SOAMES!... SOAMES!\"...    Soames stopped dead, breathing very rapidly, and looking about him right  and left. He could hear the muted pulse of sleeping London. Then, in the  dark doorway of the house before which he stood, he perceived, dimly, a  motionless figure. His first sensation was not of relief, but of fear.  The figure raised a beckoning hand. Soames, conscious that his course  was set and that he must navigate it accordingly, opened the iron gate,  passed up the path and entered the house to which he thus had been  summoned....    He found himself surrounded by absolute darkness, and the door was  closed behind him.    \"Straight ahead, Soames!\" said the familiar voice of Gianapolis out of  the darkness.    Soames, with a gasp of relief, staggered on. A hand rested upon his  shoulder, and he was guided into a room on the right of the passage.  Then an electric lamp was lighted, and he found himself confronting the  Greek.    But Gianapolis was no longer radiant; all the innate evil of the man  shone out through the smirking mask.    \"Sit down, Soames!\" he directed.    Soames, placing his bag upon the floor, seated himself in a cane  armchair. The room was cheaply furnished as an office, with a roll-top  desk, a revolving chair, and a filing cabinet. On a side-table stood  a typewriter, and about the room were several other chairs, whilst the  floor was covered with cheap linoleum. Gianapolis sat in the revolving  chair, staring at the lowered blinds of the window, and brushing up the  points of his black mustache.    With a fine white silk handkerchief Soames gently wiped the perspiration  from his forehead and from the lining of his hat-band. Gianapolis began  abruptly:--    \"There has been an--accident\" (he continued to brush his mustache, with  increasing rapidity). \"Tell me all that took place after you left the  Post Office.\"    Soames nervously related his painful experiences of the evening, whilst  Gianapolis drilled his mustache to a satanic angle. The story being  concluded:    \"Whatever has happened?\" groaned Soames; \"and what am I to do?\"    \"What you are to do,\" replied Gianapolis, \"will be arranged, my dear  Soames, by--Mr. King. Where you are to go, is a problem shortly settled:  you are to go nowhere; you are to stay here.\"...    \"Here!\"    Soames gazed drearily about the room.    \"Not exactly here--this is merely the office; but at our establishment  proper in Limehouse.\"...    \"Limehouse!\"    \"Certainly. Although you seem to be unaware of the fact, Soames,  there are some charming resorts in Limehouse; and your duties, for the  present, will confine you to one of them.\"    \"But--but,\" hesitated Soames, \"the police\"...    \"Unless my information is at fault,\" said Gianapolis, \"the police have  no greater chance of paying us a visit, now, than they had formerly.\"...    \"But Mrs. Leroux\"...    \"Mrs. Leroux!\"    Gianapolis twirled around in the chair, his eyes squinting  demoniacally:--\"Mrs. Leroux!\"    \"She--she\"...    \"What about Mrs. Leroux?\"    \"Isn't she dead?\"    \"Dead! Mrs. Leroux! You are laboring under a strange delusion, Soames.  The lady whom you saw was not Mrs. Leroux.\"    Soames' brain began to fail him again.    \"Then who,\" he began....    \"That doesn't concern you in the least, Soames. But what does concern  you is this: your connection, and my connection, with the matter cannot  possibly be established by the police. The incident is regrettable, but  the emergency was dealt with--in time. It represents a serious deficit,  unfortunately, and your own usefulness, for the moment, becomes nil; but  we shall have to look after you, I suppose, and hope for better things  in the future.\"    He took up the telephone.    \"East 39951,\" he said, whilst Soames listened, attentively. Then:--    \"Is that Kan-Suh Concessions?\" he asked. \"Yes--good! Tell Said to bring  the car past the end of the road at a quarter-to-two. That's all.\"    He hung up the receiver.    \"Now, my dear Soames,\" he said, with a faint return to his old manner,  \"you are about to enter upon new duties. I will make your position clear  to you. Whilst you do your work, and keep yourself to yourself, you are  in no danger; but one indiscretion--just one--apart from what it may  mean for others, will mean, for YOU, immediate arrest as accessory to a  murder!\"    Soames shuddered, coldly.    \"You can rely upon me, Mr. Gianapolis,\" he protested, \"to do absolutely  what you wish--absolutely. I am a ruined man, and I know it--I know it.  My only hope is that you will give me a chance.\"...    \"You shall have every chance, Soames,\" replied Gianapolis--\"every  chance.\"          XV    CAVE OF THE GOLDEN DRAGON      When the car stopped at the end of a short drive, Soames had not the  slightest idea of his whereabouts. The blinds at the window of the  limousine had been lowered during the whole journey, and now he  descended from the step of the car on to the step of a doorway. He was  in some kind of roofed-in courtyard, only illuminated by the headlamps  of the car. Mr. Gianapolis pushed him forward, and, as the door was  closed, he heard the gear of the car reversed; then--silence fell.    \"My grip!\" he began, nervously.    \"It will be placed in your room, Soames.\"    The voice of the Greek answered him from the darkness.    Guided by the hand of Gianapolis, he passed on and descended a flight of  stone steps. Ahead of him a light shone out beneath a door, and, as he  stumbled on the steps, the door was thrown suddenly open.    He found himself looking into a long, narrow apartment.... He pulled up  short with a smothered, gasping cry.    It was a cavern!--but a cavern the like of which he had never seen,  never imagined. The walls had the appearance of being rough-hewn  from virgin rock--from black rock--from rock black as the rocks of  Shellal--black as the gates of Erebus.    Placed at regular intervals along the frowning walls, to right and left,  were spiral, slender pillars, gilded and gleaming. They supported an  archwork of fancifully carven wood, which curved gently outward to the  center of the ceiling, forming, by conjunction with a similar, opposite  curve, a pointed arch.    In niches of the wall were a number of grotesque Chinese idols. The  floor was jet black and polished like ebony. Several tiger-skin rugs  were strewn about it. But, dominating the strange place, in the center  of the floor stood an ivory pedestal, supporting a golden dragon of  exquisite workmanship; and before it, as before a shrine, an enormous  Chinese vase was placed, of the hue, at its base, of deepest violet,  fading, upward, through all the shades of rose pink seen in an Egyptian  sunset, to a tint more elusive than a maiden's blush. It contained a  mass of exotic poppies of every shade conceivable, from purple so dark  as to seem black, to poppies of the whiteness of snow.    Just within the door, and immediately in front of Soames, stood a slim  man of about his own height, dressed with great nicety in a perfectly  fitting morning-coat, his well-cut cashmere trousers falling accurately  over glossy boots having gray suede uppers. His linen was immaculate,  and he wore a fine pearl in his black poplin cravat. Between two yellow  fingers smoldered a cigarette.    Soames, unconsciously, clenched his fists: this slim man embodied the  very spirit of the outre. The fantastic surroundings melted from the  ken of Soames, and he seemed to stand in a shadow-world, alone with an  incarnate shadow.    For this was a Chinaman! His jet black lusterless hair was not shaven in  the national manner, but worn long, and brushed back from his slanting  brow with no parting, so that it fell about his white collar behind,  lankly. He wore gold-rimmed spectacles, which magnified his oblique eyes  and lent him a terrifying beetle-like appearance. His mephistophelean  eyebrows were raised interrogatively, and he was smiling so as to  exhibit a row of uneven yellow teeth.    Soames, his amazement giving place to reasonless terror, fell back a  step--into the arms of Gianapolis.    \"This is our friend from Palace Mansions,\" said the Greek. He squeezed  Soames' arm, reassuringly. \"Your new principal, Soames, Mr. Ho-Pin, from  whom you will take your instructions.\"    \"I have these instructions for Mr. Soames,\" said Ho-Pin, in a metallic,  monotonous voice. (He gave to r half the value of w, with a hint of the  presence of l.) \"He will wremain here as valet until the search fowr him  becomes less wrigowrous.\"    Soames, scarce believing that he was awake, made no reply. He found  himself unable to meet the glittering eyes of the Chinaman; he glanced  furtively about the room, prepared at any moment to wake up from what  seemed to him an absurd, a ghostly dream.    \"Said will change his appeawrance,\" continued Ho-Pin, smoothly, \"so that  he will not wreadily be wrecognized. Said will come now.\"    Ho-Pin clapped his hands three times.    The door at the end of the room immediately opened, and a thick-set man  of a pronounced Arabian type, entered. He wore a chauffeur's livery of  dark blue; and Soames recognized him for the man who had driven the car.    \"Said,\" said Ho-Pin very deliberately, turning to face the new arrival,  \"ahu hina--Lucas Effendi--Mr. Lucas. Waddi el--shenta ila beta oda.  Fehimt?\"    Said bowed his head.    \"Fahim, effendi,\" he muttered rapidly.    \"Ma fihsh.\"...    Again Said bowed his head, then, glancing at Soames:--    \"Ta'ala wayyaya!\" he said.    Soames, looking helplessly at Gianapolis--who merely pointed to the  door--followed Said from the room.    He was conducted along a wide"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#18)"],[1,"themselves. One Richard the Pilgrim was the author. The song  is, in fact, a history of the crusade in which he took part, up to a  short time before the battle in which he was killed. Another very  celebrated piece of the same kind, the \"Song of Roland,\" the history  of a warrior in the suite of Charlemagne, is said to have been chanted  before the battle of Hastings by the Jongleur Taillefer. Other pieces  of the same kind were the \"Legend of the Chevalier Cygne\"  (\"Lohengrin\") \"Parsifal\" and the \"Holy Grail.\" Each one of these was  sung to a short formula of melody, which was performed over and over  incessantly, excepting variations of endings employed in the episodes.  A very eminent author of pieces of this kind was the Chevalier de  Coucy, who died 1192, in the crusade. There are twenty-four songs of  his still in the Paris Library.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.    REINMAR, THE MINNESINGER.    (From a manuscript of the thirteenth century, in the National Library  at Paris.)]    A similar development of knightly music was had in Germany from the  time of Frederick the Red--1152-1190. These were known as  minnesingers. Among the most prominent were Heinrich of Beldeke,  1184-1228, an epic writer; Spervogel, 1150-1175; and Frauenlobe,  middle of the twelfth century. The forms of the minne songs were the  song (_lede_), lay (_lerch_), proverb (_spruch_). The song rarely  exceeded one strophe; the lay frequently did. A little later we  encounter certain names which have been recently celebrated in the  poems of Wagner, such as Heinrich von Morungen, Reinmar von Hagenau,  Wolfram von Eschenbach, Gottfried von Strassburg, Walther von der  Vogelweide, Klingsor, Tannhaeuser, etc. All of these were from the  middle of the thirteenth century. A portrait of Reinmar, the  minnesinger, has come down to us with a manuscript now contained in  the National Library at Paris. The last of the minnesingers was  Heinrich von Meissen, 1260-1318. His poems were always in the praise  of woman, for which reason he was called Frauenlob (\"Woman's Praise\").  An old chronicle tells us that when he died the women of Mayence bore  him to the tomb, moistened his grave with their tears, and poured out  libations of the costliest wines of the Rhineland. The following  illustration is supposed to be a representation of this minstrel,  although the drawing is hardly up to the standard of the modern  Academy.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.    MASTER HEINRICH FRAUENLOB.    (From a manuscript in the Manesse collection at Paris.)]    The work of the minnesingers was succeeded in Germany by a class of  humbler minstrels of the common people, known as the Mastersingers,  the city of Nuremberg being their principal center. A few of these men  were real geniuses--poets of the people. One of the most celebrated  was Hans Sachs, since represented in Wagner's \"Meistersingers.\" Sachs  was a very prolific poet and composer, his pieces being of every kind,  from the simpler songs of sentiment and home to quite elaborate plays.  About nine volumes of his poems have been reprinted by the Stuttgart  Literary Union.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.    MINSTREL HARPS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY.]    The principal influence of these different classes of popular minstrel  was temporary, in keeping alive a love for music and a certain  appreciation of it. The most of their music was rather slow and  labored, and it is impossible to discover in the later development of  the art material traces of their influence upon it. In this respect  they differ materially from the Celtic and English bards mentioned in  the previous chapter. Although the productions of those minstrels have  all passed away, they have left a distinct impress upon musical  composition, even to our own day, in certain simple forms of diatonic  melody of highly expressive character. The troubadours, trouveres and  minnesingers, on the other hand, never acquired the art of spontaneous  melody, and as for harmony, there is no evidence that they made any  use of it. Their instrument of music was a small harp of ten or twelve  strings, but no more--a much smaller and less effective instrument  than the Irish harp of the eleventh century, or the Saxon of the  tenth. (See Fig. 28.)    [Illustration]          CHAPTER X.    THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.      It is not easy to define the influence of the Christian Church in this  transformation, for the reason that upon the technical side it was  slight, although upon the aesthetic side it was of very great  importance. From the circumstance that all the early theoretical  writers from the sixth century to the thirteenth were monks or  ecclesiastics of some degree, and from the very important part played  by the large cathedrals in the development of polyphonic music, many  historians have concluded that to the Church almost this entire  transformation of the art of music is due. This, however, is wide of  the truth. The Church as such had very little to do with developing an  art of music through all the early centuries. The early Christians  were humble people, for the most part, who had embraced a religion  proscribed and at times persecuted. Their meetings were private, and  attended by small numbers, as, for instance, in the Catacombs at Rome,  where the little chapels in the dark passage ways under ground were  incapable of holding more than twenty or thirty people at a time.  Under these circumstances the singing cannot have been essentially of  more musical importance than that of cottage prayer meetings of the  present day. In another way the Church, indeed, exercised a certain  amount of influence in this department as in all others, an influence  which might be described as cosmopolitan. The early apostles and  bishops traveled from one province to another, and it is likely that  the congregation in each province made use of the melodies already in  existence. The first Christian hymns and psalms were probably sung to  temple melodies brought from Jerusalem by the apostles. As new hymns  were written (something which happened very soon, under the  inspiration of the new faith and hope), they were adapted to the best  of these old melodies, just as has been done continually down to  nearly our own time. Our knowledge of the early Church, in this side  of its activity, is very limited. It is not until the time of St.  Ambrose, who was bishop of Milan in the last part of the fourth  century, that the Church began to have an official music. By this time  the process of secularization had been carried so far that there was a  great want of seriousness and nobility in the worship. St. Ambrose,  accordingly, selected certain melodies as being suitable for the  solemn hymns of the Church and the offices of the mass. He himself was  a poet of some originality. He composed quite a number of hymns, of  which the most famous is that noble piece of praise, _Te Deum  Laudamus_, a poem which has inspired a greater number of musical  settings than any other outside the canon of the Scriptures. The  melodies which St. Ambrose collected were probably from Palestine, and  he selected four scales from the Greek system, within which, as he  supposed, all future melodies should be composed. This was done, most  likely, under the impression that each one of the Greek scales had a  characteristic expression, and that the four which he chose would  suffice for the varying needs of the hymns of the Church. In naming  these scales a mistake was made, that upon re being called the Dorian,  and all the other names being applied improperly. The series upon mi  was called Phrygian, upon fa Lydian; upon sol Mixo-Lydian. The  melodies of St. Ambrose were somewhat charged with ornament, a fact  which indicates their Asiatic origin. It is probable that a part of  the melodies of the Plain Song still in use are remains of the  liturgies of St. Ambrose. The Church at Milan maintains the Ambrosian  liturgy to the present date. In this action of St. Ambrose we have a  characteristic representation of the influence which the Church has  exerted upon music in all periods of its career. Upon the aesthetic and  ethical sides the Church has awakened aspirations, hopes and faith, of  essentially musical character, and in this respect it has been one of  the most powerful sources of inspiration that musical art has  experienced. But upon the technical side the action of the Church has  been purely conservative and, not to say it disrespectfully, politic.  The end sought in every modification of the existing music has been  that of affording the congregation a musical setting for certain  hymns--a setting not inconsistent with the spirit of the hymns  themselves, but in melody agreeable to the congregation. The question  which John Wesley is reported to have asked, \"Why the devil should  have all the good tunes,\" has been a favorite conundrum with the  fathers of the Church.    Notwithstanding the firmness with which the Church at Milan maintained  the Ambrosian liturgy, in other provinces this conservatism failed;  and within the next two centuries very great abuses crept in through  the adoption of local secular melodies not yet divested of their  profane associations. St. Gregory the Great (540-595), who was elected  pope about 590, set himself to restore church music to its purity, or  rather to restrict the introduction of profane melodies, and to  establish certain limits beyond which the music should not be allowed  to pass. St. Gregory himself was not a musician. He therefore  contented himself with restoring the Ambrosian chants as far as  possible; but the musical scales established by Ambrose he somewhat  enlarged, adding to them four other scales called plagal. These were  the Hypo-Dorian, la to la; Hypo-Phrygian, si to si; Hypo-Lydian, do to  do; Hypo-AEolian, mi to mi. I do not understand that the terminal notes  of these plagal scales of St. Gregory were used as key"]]]
