They'd  wonder how we'd stolen a march on them.\"    \"If Teddie asks where we were, we can truly say 'at the front',\" Winnie  giggled.    \"You'd better not pick up any nature specimens, though, or she'll want  to know 'the exact locality' where you found them.\"    \"Um--yes! That might be awkward. This toadstool shall stay on its native  heath, in case it tells tales.\"    It was rather a fascinating walk, all amongst the gorse-bushes. None of  the three had been there before, and instinctively the younger ones left  Rona to lead the way. Her bump of locality had been well developed in  New Zealand, so she strode on with confidence. But the ground shelved  down suddenly, revealing a natural feature upon which they had not  counted, a fairly wide brook, running between sandy banks. Here indeed  was an obstacle. Winnie and Hattie stared at it with blank faces and  groaned.    \"We'd forgotten the wretched Llanelwyn stream. What atrocious luck!  Don't believe there's the ghost of a bridge anywhere. Shall we have to  go back?\"    \"I'm not going back,\" declared Rona sturdily. \"There must be some way of  getting over it some where. Come along and we'll prospect.\"    \"Oh, for the wings of a dove!\" sighed Hattie. \"Even those of the  raggedest sparrow would be welcome.\"    \"Better wish yourself a fish, for you may have to try swimming,\" grunted  Winnie.    \"I can't swim--not a stroke! You'll suggest I shall jump it next, I  suppose. Look here, we shall have to go back. There's nothing else for  it. Rona! Corona Mitchell! Corona Margarita! Cuckoo! Where've you gone  to?\"    \"Coo--ee!\" came in reply from the distance, and presently Rona appeared  beckoning vigorously.    \"We're--going--back,\" shouted Hattie.    \"No, no! Come along here.\"    Anxious to see if she had found any solution of the problem, the others  pelted down a slope and joined her.    \"Here's our bridge,\" said Rona proudly, as soon as they rounded the  corner.    \"That thing!\" exclaimed Winnie, looking aghast at the decidedly slim  pole, that was fixed across the stream as a cattle bar.    \"I'm not a tight-rope dancer, thank you!\" sneered Hattie rather  indignantly.    \"It'll be quite easy,\" Rona urged.    \"Oh, I dare say! You won't find me trying to walk across it, I can tell  you.\"    \"I didn't ask you to walk. I'm going to sit on it cross-legged, like a  tailor, and shuffle myself over. It's broad enough for that. I'll go  first.\"    \"Oh, I daren't! I'd drop in!\" wailed the younger ones in chorus.    \"Now don't funk. What two sillies you are! It won't be as hard as you  think. Just watch me do it.\"    Fortunately the pole had two great advantages: it was firmly fixed in  the bank on either side, so that it did not sway about, and, being the  trunk of a fir-tree with the bark still left on, its surface offered  some grip. Rona's progress was slow but steady. She worked herself over  by a few inches at a time. When she reached the water's edge on the far  side she dropped on to a patch of silver sand and hurrahed.    \"Buck up, and come along,\" she yelled lustily.    This was scouting with a vengeance, and more than the others had  bargained for; but the stronger will prevailed, and though they shook in  their shoes they were persuaded to make the experiment.    \"I'm all dithering,\" panted Hattie, as Winnie pushed her forward to try  first.    It was not as bad as she had expected. She was able to cling tightly  with hands and knees, and though she had one awful moment in the middle,  when she thought she was overbalancing, she reached Rona's outstretched  hand in due course.    \"You squealed like a pig,\" said the Cuckoo.    \"I thought I was done for. Wouldn't you like to feel how my heart's  beating?\"    \"No, I shouldn't. Don't be affected. Come along, Win. We can't wait all  day. I'll fish you out if you tumble in, I promise you. It isn't deep  enough to drown you.\"    With many protestations, Winnie, really very much scared, followed the  others' lead, and got along quite successfully till within a foot of the  brink; then the sudden mooing of a cow on the bank startled her, and so  upset her equilibrium that she splashed into the water, wetting one leg  thoroughly.    \"Ugh! My shoes were squelchy enough before,\" she lamented. \"You can't  think how horrid it is.\"    \"Never mind, you've got across.\"    \"But you might sympathize.\"    \"Haven't time. We shall have to hurry up if we mean to be back before  the others.\"    \"Did you think the cow was Teddie calling you?\" laughed Hattie, who,  having got her own trial over, could afford to jest at other people's  misfortunes.    \"You'd have jumped yourself. Oh dear, I spilt most of my snowdrops,  though I did tie the basket round my neck!\"    \"Never mind; you can't fish them out of the stream now. I'll give you  some of mine. Here, take these,\" said Rona. \"I've nobody to send them  to,\" she added, half to herself, as she climbed the bank.    \"Oh, thanks awfully! I always send Mother a big bunch. She looks forward  to them. I've brought a cardboard box from home on purpose to pack them  in, because the cook runs quite out of starch-boxes. Some of the girls  last year had to wrap theirs just in brown paper. If you don't want  yours, can you spare me a few more?\"    \"I'll keep just these to put in my bedroom, and you may have the rest if  you like,\" replied Rona, stalking ahead.    Every now and then the sense of her loneliness smote her. She would  probably be the only girl in the school who was not sending flowers  away to-night. How different it would be if she had anybody in England  who took an interest in her and cared to receive her snowdrops!    \"It's no use crying for the moon,\" she decided, blinking hard lest she  should betray symptoms of weakness before her juniors. \"When a thing  can't be helped it can't, and there's an end of it.\"    \"Cuckoo! Corona Margarita! Do wait for us! You walk like the wind.\"    \"Or as if a bull were chasing you,\" panted Hattie, overtaking her and  claiming a supporting arm. \"Do you see where we've got ourselves to? The  only way out of this is to go straight through the Glynmaen Wood.\"    \"Well, and why shouldn't we go through the Glynmaen Wood? Is it any  different to any other wood?\"    \"No, only they're horribly particular about trespassing. They stick up  all kinds of notices warning people off.\"    \"What rubbish! Why, in New Zealand we go where we like.\"    \"Oh, I dare say, in New Zealand!\"    \"Look, there's a notice up there,\" said Winnie, pointing over the hedge  to a tree whereon was nailed a weather-stained board bearing the  inhospitable legend: \"Trespassers Beware\".    Rona stared at it quite belligerently.    \"I should like to pull it down,\" she observed. \"What right has anybody  to try to keep places all to themselves?\"    \"I suppose it belongs to Lord Glyncraig.\"    \"All the more shame to him then. I shall take a particular pleasure in  going, just because he sticks up 'Don't'.\"    \"Suppose we're caught?\"    \"My blessed babes, you don't suppose I've come all this short cut and  scrambled over a pole to be turned back by a trespass notice! Do you  want to cross the stream again and trail home by the road?\"    \"Rather not!\"    \"Then I'll give you a boost to get over the fence there.\"    The property was well protected. It took Rona's best efforts to help her  companions to scale the high oak boards. When they had all dropped  safely to the other side they set off through the trees in the direction  they judged would bring them out nearest to The Woodlands.    Three girls in thick shoes do not pass absolutely silently through a  wood, especially if they indulge in giggles. Winnie and Hattie,  moreover, could never be together without chattering incessantly. For  the moment they had forgotten every principle of scouting. In that  quiet, secluded spot their shrill voices rang out with extreme  clearness. A rabbit or two scuttled away, and a pheasant flew off with a  whirr. Presently another and heavier pair of boots might be heard  tramping towards them, the bushes parted, and a dour-looking face, with  lantern jaws and a stubbly chin, regarded them grimly. The gamekeeper  glowered a moment, then growled out:    \"What are you three a-doing here?\"    \"That's our own business,\" retorted Rona briskly.    \"Indeed? Well, it happens to be my business too. You're trespassing, and  you know it.\"    \"We're doing no harm.\"    \"Aren't you? I suppose it's nothing to scare every pheasant in the wood.  Oh dear no!\"    \"What nonsense! It was only one,\" exclaimed Rona, standing up against  the bullying tone. \"You're making the most unnecessary fuss. What right  have you to stop us?\"    \"More right than you've got to be here. I won't have anybody in these  woods, schoolgirls or no schoolgirls, so just you get back the way you  came, or----\"    \"That will do, Jordan,\" said a voice behind him.    The keeper started, turned, and touched his cap obsequiously.    \"Beg pardon, my lord, but the trespassing that goes on here gets past  bearing, and wants putting a stop to.\"    \"Very well, I'll settle it myself,\" and Lord Glyncraig--for it was  he--readjusted his glasses and stared reprovingly at the three  delinquents.    \"Ah! girls from The Woodlands--evidently out of bounds. I shall have to  report you to your headmistress, I'm afraid. Your names, please.\"    \"Winnie Fowler,\" \"Hattie Goodwin,\" murmured two subdued voices.    Rona did not answer at all. She kept her head down and her eyes fixed on  the ground.    \"It's--it's surely not the same girl who did me such a service this  morning on the marsh? Then I must repeat my thanks. Now, look here,  you've been up to some mischief, all three of you. Get back to school as  quick as you can, and I'll say nothing about it! There! Off you go!\"    Without another word the sinners pelted along through the wood, never  pausing till they reached the railing and climbed over on to the high  road. Here, on free ground,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20733"],[0,"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 1 of 3), Essay 1: Robespierre (#18)"],[1,"with him.  Bonaparte said long afterwards, when he was expiating a life of iniquity  on the rock of Saint Helena, that he saw long letters from Maximilian to  Augustin Robespierre, all blaming the Conventional Commissioners--Tallien,  Fouche, Barras, Collot, and the rest--for the horrors they perpetrated,  and accusing them of ruining the Revolution by their atrocities. Again,  there is abundant testimony that Robespierre did his best to induce the  Committee of Public Safety to bring those odious malefactors to justice.  The text of the Law itself discloses the same object. The vague phrases of  depraving manners and applying revolutionary principles perfidiously, were  exactly calculated to smite the band of violent men whose conduct was to  Robespierre the scandal of the Revolution. And there was a curious clause  in the law as originally presented, which deprived the Convention of the  right of preventing measures against its own members. Robespierre's general  design in short was to effect a further purgation of the Convention. There  is no reason to suppose that he deliberately aimed at any more general  extermination. On the other hand, it is incredible that, as some have  maintained, he should merely have had in view the equalisation of rich and  poor before the tribunals, by withdrawing the aid of counsel and testimony  to civic character from both rich and poor alike.    If Robespierre's design was what we believe it to have been, the result  was a ghastly failure. The Committee of Public Safety would not consent  to apply his law against the men for whom he had specially designed it.  The frightful weapon which he had forged was seized by the Committee of  General Security, and Paris was plunged into the fearful days of the  Great Terror. The number of persons put to death by the Revolutionary  Tribunal before the Law of Prairial had been comparatively moderate.  From the creation of the tribunal in April 1793, down to the execution  of the Hebertists in March 1794, the number of persons condemned to  death was 505. From the death of the Hebertists down to the death of  Robespierre, the number of the condemned was 2158. One half of the  entire number of victims, namely, 1356, were guillotined after the Law  of Prairial. No deadlier instrument was ever invented by the cruelty of  man. Innocent women no less than innocent men, poor no less than rich,  those in whom life was almost spent, no less than those in whom its  pulse was strongest, virtuous no less than vicious, were sent off in  woe-stricken batches all those summer days. A man was informed against;  he was seized in his bed at five in the morning; at seven he was taken  to the Conciergerie; at nine he received information of the charge  against him; at ten he went into the dock; by two in the afternoon he  was condemned; by four his head lay in the executioner's basket.    What stamps the system of the Terror at this date with a wickedness  that cannot be effaced, is that at no moment was the danger from foreign  or domestic foe less serious. We may always forgive something to  well-grounded panic. The proscriptions of an earlier date in Paris were  not excessively sanguinary, if we remember that the city abounded in  royalists and other reactionists, who were really dangerous in fomenting  discouragement and spreading confusion. If there ever is an excuse for  martial law, and it must be rare, the French government were warranted  in resorting to it in 1793. Paris in those days was like a city  beleaguered, and the world does not use very harsh words about the  commandant of a besieged town who puts to death traitors found within  his walls. Opinion in England at this very epoch encouraged the Tory  government to pass a Treason Bill, which introduced as vague a  definition of treasonable offence as even the Law of Prairial itself.  Windham did not shrink from declaring in parliament that he and his  colleagues were determined to exact 'a rigour beyond the law.' And they  were as good as their word. The Jacobins had no monopoly either of cruel  law or cruel breach of law in the eighteenth century. Only thirty years  before, opinion in Pennsylvania had prompted a hideous massacre of  harmless Indians as a deed acceptable to God, and the grandson of  William Penn proclaimed a bounty of fifty dollars for the scalp of a  female Indian, and three times as much for a male. A man would have had  quite as good a chance of justice from the Revolutionary Tribunal, as  at the hands of Braxfield, the Scotch judge, who condemned Muir and  Palmer for sedition in 1793, and who told the government, with a brazen  front worthy of Carrier or Collot d'Herbois themselves, that, if they  would only send him prisoners, he would find law for them.    We have no sympathy with the spirit of paradox that has arisen in these  days, amusing itself by the vindication of bad men. We think that the  author of the Law of Prairial was a bad man. But it is time that there  should be an end of the cant which lifts up its hands at the crimes of  republicans and freethinkers, and shuts its eyes to the crimes of kings  and churches. Once more, we ought to rise into a higher air; we ought to  condemn, wherever we find it, whether on the side of our adversaries or  on our own, all readiness to substitute arbitrary force for the  processes of ordered justice. There are moments when such a readiness  may be leniently judged, but Prairial of 1794 was not one of them either  in France or in England. And what makes the crime of this law more  odious, is its association with the official proclamation of the State  worship of a Supreme Being. The scene of Robespierre's holy festival  becomes as abominable as a catholic Auto-da-fe, where solemn homage was  offered to the God of pity and loving-kindness, while flame glowed round  the limbs of the victims.           *       *       *       *       *    Robespierre was inflamed with resentment, not because so many people  were guillotined every day, but because the objects of his own enmity  were not among them. He was chagrined at the miscarriage of his scheme;  but the chagrin had its root in his desire for order, and not in his  humanity. A good man--say so imperfectly good a man as Danton--could not  have endured life, after enacting such a law, and seeing the ghastly  work that it was doing. He could hardly have contented himself with  drawing tears from the company in Madame Duplay's little parlour, by his  pathetic recitations from Corneille and Racine, or with listening to  melting notes from the violin of Le Bas. It is commonly said by  Robespierre's defenders that he withdrew from the Committee of Public  Safety, as soon as he found out that he was powerless to arrest the  daily shedding of blood. The older assumption used to be that he left  Paris, and ceased to be cognisant of the Committee's deliberations. The  minutes, however, prove that this was not the case. Robespierre signed  papers nearly every day of Messidor--(June 19 to July 18) the  blood-stained month between Prairial and Thermidor--and was thoroughly  aware of the doings of the Committee. His partisans have now fallen back  on the singular theory of what they style moral absence. He was present  in the flesh, but standing aloof in the spirit. His frowning silence was  a deadlier rebuke to the slayers and oppressors than secession.  Unfortunately for this ingenious explanation of the embarrassing fact of  a merciful man standing silent before merciless doings, there are at  least two facts that show its absurdity.    First, there is the affair of Catherine Theot. Catherine Theot was a  crazy old woman of a type that is commoner in protestant than in  catholic countries. She believed herself to have special gifts in the  interpretation of the holy writings, and a few other people as crazy as  herself chose to accept her pretensions. One revelation vouchsafed to  her was to the effect that Robespierre was a Messiah and the new  redeemer of the human race. The Committee of General Security resolved  to indict this absurd sect. Vadier,--one of the roughest of the men whom  the insurrections of Paris had brought to the front--reported on the  charges to the Convention (27 Prairial, June 15), and he took the  opportunity to make Robespierre look profoundly ridiculous. The  unfortunate Messiah sat on his bench, gnawing his lips with bitter rage,  while, amid the sneers and laughter of the Convention, the officers  brought to the bar the foolish creatures who had called him the Son of  God. His thin pride and prudish self-respect were unutterably affronted,  and he quite understood that the ridicule of the mysticism of Theot was  an indirect pleasantry upon his own Supreme Being. He flew to the  Committee of Public Safety, angrily reproached them for permitting the  prosecution, summoned Fouquier-Tinville, and peremptorily ordered him to  let the matter drop. In vain did the public prosecutor point out that  there was a decree of the Convention ordering him to proceed.  Robespierre was inexorable. The Committee of General Security were  baffled, and the prosecution ended. 'Lutteur impuissant et fatigue,'  says M. Hamel, the most thoroughgoing defender of Robespierre, upon  this, 'il va se retirer, moralement du moins.' Impotent and wearied! But  he had just won a most signal victory for good sense and humanity. Why  was it the only one? If Robespierre was able to save Theot, why could he  not save Cecile Renault?    Cecile Renault was a young seamstress who was found one evening at the  door of Robespierre's lodging, calling out in a state of exaltation that  she would fain see what a tyrant looked like. She was arrested, and upon  her were found two little knives used for the purposes of her trade.  That she should be arrested and imprisoned was natural enough. The times  were charged with deadly fire. People had not forgotten that Marat had  been murdered in his"]]]
