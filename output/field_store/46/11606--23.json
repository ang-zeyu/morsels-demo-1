In the centre  of the nave, multitudes of gay, gaudy, noisy persons, the petty  shopkeepers, laquais, and _popolaccio_ of the city, strolled and laughed,  and talked loud.\" About three o'clock the service began, with a choral  swell, blazing torches, and a crowded procession of priests of every rank  and order. It lasted for two hours; then began the procession to the cell  where the cradle lay, enshrined in a blaze of tapers and guarded by  groups of devotees. Thence it was borne with solemn chants to the chapel  of _Santa Croce_. A musical Mass followed, and the _culla_ being at last  deposited on the High Altar, the wearied spectators issued forth just as  the dome of St. Peter's caught the first light of the morning.{68}    Still to-day the scene in the church at the five o'clock High Mass on  Christmas morning is extraordinarily impressive, with the crowds of poor  people, the countless lights at which the children gaze in open-eyed  wonder, the many low Masses said in the side chapels, the imposing  procession and the setting of the silver casket on the High Altar. The  history of the relics of the _culla_--five long narrow pieces of wood--is  obscure, but it is admitted even by some orthodox Roman Catholics that  there is no sufficient evidence to connect them with Bethlehem.{69}    The famous _Bambino_ at the Franciscan church of Ara Coeli on the citadel  of Rome is \"a flesh-coloured doll, tightly swathed in gold and silver  tissue, crowned, and sparkling with jewels,\" no thing of beauty, but  believed to have miraculous powers. An inscription in the sacristy of the  church states that it was made by a devout Minorite of wood from the  Mount of Olives, and given flesh-colour by the interposition of God  Himself. It has its own servants and its own carriage in which it drives  out to visit the sick. There is a strange story of a theft of the  wonder-working image by a woman who feigned sickness, obtained permission  to have the _Bambino_ left with her, and then sent back to the friars  another image dressed in its clothes. That night the Franciscans heard  great ringing of bells and knockings at the church door, and found  outside the true _Bambino_, naked in the wind and rain. Since then it has  never been allowed out alone.{70}    |116| All through the Christmas and Epiphany season Ara Coeli is  crowded with visitors to the _Bambino_. Before the _presepio_, where it  lies, is erected a wooden platform on which small boys and girls of all  ranks follow one another with little speeches--\"preaching\" it is  called--in praise of the infant Lord. \"They say their pieces,\" writes  Countess Martinengo, \"with an infinite charm that raises half a smile and  half a tear.\" They have the vivid dramatic gift, the extraordinary  absence of self-consciousness, typical of Italian children, and their  \"preaching\" is anything but a wooden repetition of a lesson learned by  heart. Nor is there any irksome constraint; indeed to northerners the  scene in the church might seem irreverent, for the children blow toy  trumpets and their parents talk freely on all manner of subjects. The  church is approached by one hundred and twenty-four steps, making an  extraordinarily picturesque spectacle at this season, when they are  thronged by people ascending and descending, and by vendors of all sorts  of Christmas prints and images. On the Octave of the Epiphany there is a  great procession, ending with the blessing of Rome by the Holy Child. The  _Bambino_ is carried out to the space at the top of the giddy flight of  marble steps, and a priest raises it on high and solemnly blesses the  Eternal City.{71}    A glimpse of the southern Christmas may be had in London in the Italian  colony in and around Eyre Street Hill, off the Clerkenwell Road, a little  town of poor Italians set down in the midst of the metropolis. The steep,  narrow Eyre Street Hill, with its shops full of southern wares, is dingy  enough by day, but after dark on Christmas Eve it looks like a bit of  Naples. The windows are gay with lights and coloured festoons, there are  lantern-decked sweetmeat stalls, one old man has a _presepio_ in his  room, other people have little altars or shrines with candles burning,  and bright pictures of saints adorn the walls. It is a strangely pathetic  sight, this _festa_ of the children of the South, this attempt to keep an  Italian Christmas amid the cold damp dreariness of a London slum. The  colony has its own church, San Pietro, copied from some Renaissance  basilica at Rome, a building half tawdry, half magnificent, which  transports him who enters it far away to the South. Like every Italian  church, it is |117| at once the Palace of the Great King and the refuge  of the humblest--no other church in London is quite so intimately the  home of the poor. Towards twelve o'clock on Christmas Eve the deep-toned  bell of San Pietro booms out over the colony, and the people crowd to the  Midnight Mass, and pay their devotions at a great _presepio_ set up for  the veneration of the faithful. When on the Octave of the Epiphany[40]  the time comes to close the crib, an impressive and touching ceremony  takes place. The afternoon Benediction over, the priest, with the  acolytes, goes to the _presepio_ and returns to the chancel with the  _Bambino_. Holding it on his arm, he preaches in Italian on the story of  the Christ Child. The sermon ended, the notes of \"Adeste, fideles\" are  heard, and while the Latin words are sung the faithful kneel at the altar  rails and reverently kiss the Holy Babe. It is their farewell to the  _Bambino_ till next Christmas.           *       *       *       *       *    A few details may here be given about the religious customs at Christmas  in Spain. The Midnight Mass is there the great event of the festival.  Something has already been said as to its celebration in Madrid. The  scene at the midnight service in a small Andalusian country town is thus  described by an English traveller:--\"The church was full; the service  orderly; the people of all classes. There were muleteers, wrapped in  their blue and white checked rugs; here, Spanish gentlemen, enveloped in  their graceful capas, or capes ... here, again, were crowds of the  commonest people,--miners, fruitsellers, servants, and the like,--the  women kneeling on the rush matting of the dimly-lit church, the men  standing in dark masses behind, or clustering in groups round every  pillar.... At last, from under the altar, the senior priest ... took out  the image of the Babe New-born, reverently and slowly, and held it up in  his hands for adoration. Instantly every one crossed himself, and fell on  his knees in silent worship.\"{72} The crib is very popular in Spanish  homes and is the delight of children, as may be learnt from Fernan  Caballero's interesting sketch of Christmas Eve in Spain, \"La Noche de  Navidad.\"{73}    |118| In England the Christmas crib is to be found nowadays in most  Roman, and a few Anglican, churches. In the latter it is of course an  imitation, not a survival. It is, however, possible that the custom of  carrying dolls about in a box at Advent or Christmas time, common in some  parts of England in the nineteenth century, is a survival, from the  Middle Ages, of something like the crib. The so-called \"vessel-cup\" was  \"a box containing two dolls, dressed up to represent the Virgin and the  infant Christ, decorated with ribbons and surrounded by flowers and  apples.\" The box had usually a glass lid, was covered by a white napkin,  and was carried from door to door by a woman.{74} It was esteemed very  unlucky for any household not to be visited by the \"Advent images\" before  Christmas Eve, and the bearers sang the well-known carol of the \"Joys of  Mary.\"{75} In Yorkshire only one image was carried about.{76} At  Gilmorton, Leicestershire, a friend of the present writer remembers that  the children used to carry round what they called a \"Christmas Vase,\" an  open box without lid in which lay three dolls side by side, with oranges  and sprigs of evergreen. Some people regarded these as images of the  Virgin, the Christ Child, and Joseph.[41]           *       *       *       *       *    In this study of the feast of the Nativity as represented in liturgy and  ceremonial we have already come close to what may strictly be called  drama; in the next chapter we shall cross the border line and consider  the religious plays of the Middle Ages and the relics of or parallels to  them found in later times.    |119| |120| |121|          CHAPTER V    CHRISTMAS DRAMA          Origins of the Mediaeval Drama--Dramatic Tendencies in the      Liturgy--Latin Liturgical Plays--The Drama becomes      Laicized--Characteristics of the Popular Drama--The Nativity in the      English Miracle Cycles--Christmas Mysteries in France--Later French      Survivals of Christmas Drama--German Christmas Plays--Mediaeval      Italian Plays and Pageants--Spanish Nativity Plays--Modern Survivals      in Various Countries--The Star-singers, &c.

Galil._]    Unto this I may adde another testimony of _Bapt. Cisatus_, as he is  quoted by _Nierembergius_,[1] grounded upon an observation taken 23.  yeeres after this of _Maeslin_, and writ to this _Euseb. Nieremberg._ in  a letter by that diligent and judicious Astronomer. The words of it  runne thus:      _Et quidem in eclipsi nupra solari quae fuit ipso die natali Christi,    observavi clare in luna soli supposita, quidpiam quod valde probat    id ipsum quod Cometae quoque & maculae solares urgent, nempe coelum non    esse a tenuitate & variationibus aeris exemptum, nam circa Lunam    adverti esse sphaeram seu orbem quendam vaporosum, non secus atque    circum terram, adeoque sicut ex terra in aliquam usque sphaeram    vapores & exhalationes expirant, ita quoque ex luna._      \"In that late solary eclipse which happened on Christmas day, when    the Moone was just under the Sunne, I plainly discerned that in her    which may clearely confirme what the Comets and Sunne spots doe seeme    to prove, _viz._ that the heavens are not solid, nor freed from those    changes which our aire is liable unto, for about the Moone I perceived    such an orbe of vaporous aire, as that is which doth encompasse our    earth, and as vapours and exhalations, are raised from our earth into    this aire, so are they also from the Moone.\"      [Sidenote 1: _Hist. Nat. l. 2. c. 11._]    You see what probable grounds and plaine testimonies have brought for  the confirmation of this Proposition: many other things in this behalfe  might be spoken, which for brevity sake I now omit, and passe unto the  next.          Proposition 13.    _That tis probable there may be inhabitants in this other World, but    of what kinde they are is uncertaine._      I have already handled the Seasons and Meteors belonging to this new  World: 'tis requisite that in the next place I should come unto the  third thing which I promised, and to say somewhat of the inhabitants,  concerning whom there might be many difficult questions raised, as  whether that place be more inconvenient for habitation then our World  (as _Keplar_ thinkes) whether they are the seed of _Adam_, whether they  are there in a blessed estate, or else what meanes there may be for  their salvation, with many other such uncertaine enquiries, which I  shall willingly omit, leaving it to their examination, who have more  leisure and learning for the search of such particulars.    Being for mine own part content only to set downe such notes belonging  unto these which have observed in other Writers.      _Cum tota illa regio nobis ignota sit, remanent inhabitores illi    ignoti penitus_,    (saith _Cusanus_)[1] since we know not the regions of that place, wee  must be altogether ignorant of the inhabitants. There hath not yet beene  any such discovery concerning these, upon which wee may build a  certainty, or good probability: well may wee guesse at them, and that  too very doubtfully, but we can know nothing, for if we doe hardly  guesse aright at things which be upon earth, if with labour wee doe  finde the things that are at hand, [2]how then can wee search out those  things that are in Heaven? What a little is that which wee know? in  respect of those many matters contained within this great Universe, this  whole globe of earth and water? though it seeme to us to be of a large  extent, yet it beares not so great a proportion unto the whole frame of  Nature, as a small sand doth unto it; and what can such little creatures  as wee discerne, who are tied to this point of earth? or what can they  in the Moone know of us? If wee understand any thing (saith _Esdras_[3])  'tis nothing but that which is upon the earth, and hee that dwelleth  above in the Heavens, may onely understand the things that are above in  the heighth of the heavens.      [Sidenote 1: _De doct. ign. l. 2. c. 12._]      [Sidenote 2: Wisd. 9. 16.]      [Sidenote 3: 2 Esd. 4. 22.]    So that 'twere a very needelesse thing for us, to search after any  particulars, however, wee may guesse in the generall, that there are  some inhabitans in that Planet: for why else did Providence furnish that  place with all such conveniences of habitation as have beene above  declared?    But you will say, perhaps, is there not too great and intollerable a  heate, since the Sunne is in their Zinith every moneth, and doth tarry  their so long before hee leaves it?    I answer, 1. This may, perhaps, be remedied (as it is under the line) by  the frequencie of mid-day showers, which may cloud their Sunne, and  coole their earth: 2. The equality of their nights doth much temper the  scorching of the day, and the extreme cold that comes from the one,  require some space before it can be dispelled by the other, so that the  heate spending a great while before it can have the victory, hath not  afterwards much time to rage in. Wherfore notwithstanding this, yet that  place may remaine habitable. And this was the opinion of the _Cardinal  de Cusa_, when speaking of this Planet, he saies,[1]      _Hic locus Mundi est habitatio hominum & animalium atque    vegetabilium_.      \"This part of the world is inhabited by men and beasts, and Plantes.\"    To him assented _Campanella_, but hee cannot determine whether there  were men, or rather some other kinde of creatures. If they were men,  then he thinkes they could not be infected with _Adams_ sinne; yet,  perhaps, they had some of their owne, which might make them liable to  the same misery with us, out of which, perhaps, they were delivered by  the same means as we, the death of Christ, and thus he thinkes that  place of the _Ephesians_ may be interpreted, where the Apostle saies,[2]  _God gathered all things together in Christ, both which are in earth,  and which are in the heavens_: So also that of the same Apostle to the  _Colossians_, where hee saies,[3] that _it pleased the Father to  reconcile all things unto himselfe by Christ, whether they be things in  earth, or things in heaven_.      [Sidenote 1: _De doct. ign. l. 2. c. 12._]      [Sidenote 2: Eph. 1. 10.]      [Sidenote 3: Col. 1. 20.]    But I dare not jest with Divine truthes, or apply these places according  as fancy directs. As I thinke this opinion doth not any where contradict  Scripture, so I thinke likewise, that it cannot be proved from it,  wherefore _Campanella's_ second conjecture may be more probable, that  the inhabitants of that world, are not men as wee are, but some other  kinde of creatures which beare some proportion and likenesse to our  natures, and _Cusanus_ too thinkes they differ from us in many respects;  I will set downe his words as they may bee found in the abovecited  place,      _Suspicamus in regione solis magis esse solares, claros & illuminatos    intellectuares habitatores, spiritu aliores etiam quam in luna, ubi    magis lunatici, & in terra, magis materiales, & grossi, ut illi    intellectualis naturae solares sint multum in actu & parum in    potentia; terreni vero magis in potentia, & parum in actu, lunares    in medio fluctuantes. Hoc quidem opinamur ex influentia ignili    solis aquatica simul & aeria lunae, & gravedine materiali terrae,    & consimiliter de aliis stellarum regionibus suspicantes, nullam    habitatoribus carere, quasi tot sint partes particulares mundiales    omnius universi, quot sunt stellae quarum non est numerus, nisi apud    eum qui omnia in numero creavit._      \"Wee may conjecture (saith he) the inhabiters of the Sunne are    like to the nature of that Planet, more cleare and bright, more    intellectuall and spirituall than those in the Moone where they    are neerer to the nature of that duller Planet, and those of the    earth being more grosse and materiall than either, so that these    intellectuall natures in the Sun, are more forme than matter, those    in the earth more matter than forme, and those in the Moone betwixt    both. This wee may guesse from the fiery influence of the Sunne, the    watery and aereous influence of the Moone, as also the matereall    heavinesse of the earth. In some such manner likewise is it with the    regions of the other Starres, for wee conjecture that none of them    are without inhabitants, but that there are so many particular    worlds and parts of this one universe, as there are Stars which are    innumerable, unlesse it bee to him who created all things in number.\"    For he held that the stars were not all in one equall Orbe as we  commonly suppose, but that some were farre higher than others which made  them appeare lesse and that many others were so farre above any of  these, that they were altogether invisible unto us. An opinion (which as  I conceive) hath not any great probability for it, nor certainty against  it.    The Priest of _Saturne_ relating to _Plutarch_ (as he faignes it) the  nature of the Selenites, told him they were of divers dispositions, some  desiring to live in the lower parts of the Moone, where they might looke  downewards upon us, while others were more surely mounted aloft, all of  them shining like the rayes of the Sun, and as being victorious are  crowned with garlands made with the wings of _Eustathia_ or  _Constancie_.    It hath beene the opinion amongst some of the Ancients, that their  Heavens and Elysian fields were in the Moone where the aire is most  quiet and pure. Thus _Socrates_, thus _Plato_,[1] with his followers,  did esteeme this to bee the place where those purer soules inhabit, who  are freed from the Sepulchre, and contagion of the body. And by the  Fable of _Ceres_, continually wandring in search of her daughter  _Proserpina_, is meant nothing else but the longing desire of men, who  live upon _Ceres_ earth, to attaine a place in _Proserpina_, the Moone  or Heaven.
