In a low bush near by, I come upon the object of his  solicitude, a thick, compact nest, composed largely of dry leaves and  fine grass, in which a plain brown bird is sitting upon four pale blue  eggs.    The wonder is, that a bird will leave the apparent security of the  tree-tops, to place its nest in the way of the many dangers that walk  and crawl upon the ground. There, far out of reach, sings the bird;  here, not three feet from the ground, are its eggs or helpless young.  The truth is, birds are the greatest enemies of birds, and it is with  reference to this fact that many of the smaller species build.    [Illustration: INDIGO BIRD'S NEST.]    Perhaps the greatest proportion of birds breed along highways. I have  known the ruffed grouse to come out of a dense wood and make its nest  at the root of a tree within ten paces of the road, where, no doubt,  hawks and crows, as well as skunks and foxes, would be less liable to  find it out. Traversing remote mountain-roads through dense woods, I  have repeatedly seen the veery, or Wilson's thrush, sitting upon her  nest, so near me that I could almost take her from it by stretching  out my hand. Birds of prey show none of this confidence in man, and,  when locating their nests, avoid rather than seek his haunts.    In a certain locality in the interior of New York, I know, every  season, where I am sure to find a nest or two of the slate-colored  snow-bird. It is under the brink of a low, mossy bank, so near the  highway that it could be reached from a passing vehicle with a whip.  Every horse or wagon or foot passenger disturbs the sitting bird. She  awaits the near approach of a sound of feet or wheels, and then darts  quickly across the road, barely clearing the ground, and disappears  amid the bushes on the opposite side.    In the trees that line one of the main streets and fashionable drives  leading out of Washington city, and less than half a mile from the  boundary, I have counted the nests of five different species at one  time, and that without any very close scrutiny of the foliage, while  in many acres of woodland, half a mile off, I searched in vain for a  single nest. Among the five that interested me most was that of a blue  grossbeak. Here this bird, which, according to Audubon's observations,  in Louisiana is shy and recluse, affecting remote marshes and the  borders of large ponds of stagnant water, had placed its nest in the  lowest twig of the lowest branch of a large sycamore, immediately over  a great thoroughfare, and so near the ground that a person standing in  a cart or sitting on a horse could have reached it with his hand. The  nest was composed mainly of fragments of newspaper and stalks of  grass, and, though so low, was remarkably well concealed by one of the  peculiar clusters of twigs and leaves which characterize this tree.  The nest contained young when I discovered it, and though the parent  birds were much annoyed by my loitering about beneath the tree, they  paid little attention to the stream of vehicles that was constantly  passing. It is a wonder to me when the birds could have built it, for  they are much shyer when building than at other times. No doubt they  worked mostly in the morning, having the early hours all to  themselves.    Another pair of blue grossbeaks built in a graveyard within the city  limits. The nest was placed in a low bush, and the male continued to  sing at intervals till the young were ready to fly. The song of this  bird is a rapid, intricate warble, like that of the indigo-bird,  though stronger and louder. Indeed, these two birds so much resemble  each other in color, form, manner, voice, and general habits that,  were it not for the difference in size,--the grossbeak being nearly as  large again as the indigo-bird,--it would be a hard matter to tell  them apart. The females of both species are clad in the same  reddish-brown suits. So are the young the first season.    Of course in the deep, primitive woods also are nests, but how rarely  we find them! The simple art of the bird consists in choosing common,  neutral-tinted material, as moss, dry leaves, twigs, and various odds  and ends, and placing the structure on a convenient branch, where it  blends in color with its surroundings; but how consummate is this art,  and how skilfully is the nest concealed! We occasionally light upon  it, but who, unaided by the movements of the bird, could find it out?  During the present season, I went to the woods nearly every day for a  fortnight, without making any discoveries of this kind, till one day,  paying them a farewell visit, I chanced to come upon several nests. A  black and white creeping warbler suddenly became much alarmed as I  approached a crumbling old stump in a dense part of the forest. He  alighted upon it, chirped sharply, ran up and down its sides, and  finally left it with much reluctance. The nest, which contained three  young birds nearly fledged, was placed upon the ground, at the foot of  the stump, and in such a position that the color of the young  harmonized perfectly with the bits of bark, sticks, etc., lying about.  My eye rested upon them for the second time before I made them out.  They hugged the nest very closely, but as I put down my hand they  scampered off with loud cries for help, which caused the parent birds  to place themselves almost within my reach. The nest was merely a  little dry grass arranged in a thick bed of dry leaves.    This was amid a thick undergrowth. Moving on into a passage of large,  stately hemlocks, with only here and there a small beech or maple  rising up into the perennial twilight, I paused to make out a note  which was entirely new to me. It is still in my ear. Though  unmistakably a bird note, it yet suggested the bleating of a tiny  lambkin. Presently the birds appeared,--a pair of the solitary vireo.  They came flitting from point to point, alighting only for a moment at  a time, the male silent, but the female uttering this strange, tender  note. It was a rendering into some new sylvan dialect of the human  sentiment of maidenly love. It was really pathetic in its sweetness  and childlike confidence and joy. I soon discovered that the pair were  building a nest upon a low branch a few yards from me. The male flew  cautiously to the spot, and adjusted something, and the twain moved  on, the female calling to her mate at intervals, _love-e, love-e_,  with a cadence and tenderness in the tone that rang in the ear long  afterward. The nest was suspended to the fork of a small branch, as is  usual with the vireos, plentifully lined with lichens, and bound and  rebound with masses of coarse spider-webs. There was no attempt at  concealment except in the neutral tints, which made it look like a  natural growth of the dim, gray woods.    Continuing my random walk, I next paused in a low part of the woods,  where the larger trees began to give place to a thick second growth  that covered an old Bark-peeling. I was standing by a large maple,  when a small bird darted quickly away from it, as if it might have  come out of a hole near its base. As the bird paused a few yards from  me, and began to chirp uneasily, my curiosity was at once excited.  When I saw it was the female mourning ground warbler, and remembered  that the nest of this bird had not yet been seen by any  naturalist,--that not even Dr. Brewer had ever seen the eggs,--I felt  that here was something worth looking for. So I carefully began the  search, exploring inch by inch the ground, the base and roots of the  tree, and the various shrubby growths about it, till, finding nothing,  and fearing I might really put my foot in it, I bethought me to  withdraw to a distance and after some delay return again, and, thus  forewarned, note the exact point from which the bird flew. This I did,  and, returning, had little difficulty in discovering the nest. It was  placed but a few feet from the maple-tree, in a bunch of ferns, and  about six inches from the ground. It was quite a massive nest,  composed entirely of the stalks and leaves of dry grass, with an inner  lining of fine, dark-brown roots. The eggs, three in number, were of  light flesh color, uniformly specked with fine brown specks. The  cavity of the nest was so deep that the back of sitting bird sank  below the edge.    In the top of a tall tree, a short distance farther on, I saw the nest  of the red-tailed hawk,--a large mass of twigs and dry sticks. The  young had flown, but still lingered in the vicinity, and, as I  approached, the mother bird flew about over me, squealing in a very  angry, savage manner. Tufts of the hair and other indigestible  material of the common meadow mouse lay around on the ground beneath  the nest.    [Illustration: NEST OF RED-EYED VIREO.]    As I was about leaving the woods, my hat almost brushed the nest of  the red-eyed vireo, which hung basket-like on the end of a low,  drooping branch of the beech. I should never have seen it had the bird  kept her place. It contained three eggs of the bird's own, and one of  the cow-bunting. The strange egg was only just perceptibly larger than  the others, yet three days after, when I looked into the nest again  and found all but one egg hatched, the young interloper was at least  four times as large as either of the others, and with such a  superabundance of bowels as to almost smother his bedfellows beneath  them. That the intruder should fare the same as the rightful  occupants, and thrive with them, was more than ordinary potluck; but  that it alone should thrive, devouring, as it were, all the rest, is  one of those freaks of Nature in which she would seem to discourage  the homely virtues of prudence and honesty. Weeds and parasites have  the odds greatly against them, yet they wage a very successful war  nevertheless.

Case opened in behalf of the U.S. by Mr. Crowley.    MR. VAN VOORHIS: I wish to raise some questions upon the indictment in  this case. This indictment, I claim, is bad for two reasons, and should  be quashed.    First--The Act of Congress under which it is framed, is invalid so far  as it relates to this offence, because not authorized by the  Constitution of the United States.    Second--There is no sufficient statement of any offence in the  indictment.      First.    Congress has no power to pass laws for the punishment of Inspectors of  Elections, elected or appointed under the laws of the State of New York,  for receiving illegal votes, or registering as voters, persons who have  no right to be registered.    No law of Congress defines the qualifications of voters in the several  States. These are found only in the State Constitutions and Statutes.  The offenses charged in the indictment are, that the defendants, being  State officers, have violated the laws of the State. If it be so, they  may be tried and punished in accordance with the State laws. No  proposition can be clearer. If the United States can also punish them  for the same offense, it follows that they may be twice indicted, tried,  convicted and punished for one offense. A plea in a State Court, of a  conviction and sentence, in a United States Court would constitute no  bar or defense, (_12 Metcalf_, _387_, _Commonwealth v. Peters_,) and the  defendants might be punished twice for the same offense. This cannot be,  and if the act in question be valid, the State of New York is ousted of  jurisdiction. And where does Congress derive the power to pass laws to  punish offenders against the laws of a State? This case must be tried  under the laws of the United States. Against those laws, no offense is  charged to have been committed. Such power, if it exist, must be  somewhere expressly granted, or it must be necessary in order to execute  some power that is expressly granted.    The Act of Congress in question, became a law on May 31st, 1870. It is  entitled--    \"AN ACT TO ENFORCE THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO VOTE IN  THE SEVERAL STATES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSE.\"    The indictment is found under the 19th section of the Act as it passed  originally, and the 20th section as amended by the Act of February 28th,  1871.    The 19th Section, so far as it is necessary to quote it here, is as  follows:         \"_That if at any election for representatives or delegates in the       Congress of the United States any person shall knowingly_ personate       and vote, or attempt to vote, in the name of any other person,       whether living or dead, or fictitious; or vote more than once at       the same election for any candidate for the same office; or vote at       a place where he may not be entitled to vote; _or vote without       having a lawful right to vote, ... or knowingly and wilfully       receives the vote of any person not entitled to vote_, or refuses       to receive the vote of any person entitled to vote; ... every such       person shall be deemed guilty of a crime, and shall for such crime       be liable to prosecution in any Court of the United States of       competent jurisdiction, and on conviction thereof, shall be       punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by       imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or both, in the       discretion of the Court, and shall pay the costs of prosecution.\"    Section 20, as amended, so far as pertinent, reads as follows:         \"That if at any registration of voters for an election for       representatives or delegates in the Congress of the United States,       any person shall _knowingly_ ... hinder any person having a lawful       right to register, from duly exercising that right; or compel or       induce by any of such means, or other unlawful means, ANY OFFICER       OF REGISTRATION to admit to registration any person not legally       entitled thereto; ... _or if any such officer shall knowingly and       wilfully register as a voter any person not entitled to be       registered_, or refuse so to register any person entitled to be       registered, ... _every such person shall be deemed guilty of a       crime, and shall be liable to prosecution and punishment therefor,       as provided in section 19 of said Act of May 31, 1870, for persons       guilty of the crimes therein specified_.\"    No law of Congress describes the qualifications of voters in this State,  or in any State.    Congress has provided no registry law. Therefore, what constitutes the  offenses charged in this indictment, must be looked for in the laws of  the State. By no Act of Congress can it be determined in what case a  person votes, \"_without having a right to vote_.\" By no Act of Congress  can it be determined when an Inspector of Election has received the vote  of \"_any person not entitled to vote_,\" or has registered \"_as a voter,  any person not entitled to be registered_.\" These are the offenses  alleged in this indictment. They are penal offenses by the Statutes of  New York. The jurisdiction of the State Courts over them is complete,  and cannot be questioned.    By the Act of May 31, 1870, above cited, Congress has ordained, in legal  effect, that if any person violates the penal Code of the State of New"]]]
