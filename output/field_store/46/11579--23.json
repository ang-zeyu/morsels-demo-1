[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#18)"],[1," he dedicated that touching  ode; and he thus intimates the continuance of his early affection for  \"The fair haired lass of the west,\" in a letter of that time to Mrs.  Dunlop. \"If there is another life, it must be only for the just, the  benevolent, the amiable, and the humane. What a flattering idea, then,  is a world to come! There shall I, with speechless agony of rapture,  again recognise my lost, my ever dear Mary, whose bosom was fraught  with truth, honour, constancy, and love.\" These melancholy words gave  way in their turn to others of a nature lively and humorous: \"Tam  Glen,\" in which the thoughts flow as freely as the waters of the Nith,  on whose banks he wrote it; \"Findlay,\" with its quiet vein of sly  simplicity; \"Willie brewed a peck o' maut,\" the first of social, and  \"She's fair and fause,\" the first of sarcastic songs, with \"The deil's  awa wi' the Exciseman,\" are all productions of this period--a period  which had besides its own fears and its own forebodings.    For a while Burns seemed to prosper in his farm: he held the plough  with his own hand, he guided the harrows, he distributed the seed-corn  equally among the furrows, and he reaped the crop in its season, and  saw it safely covered in from the storms of winter with \"thack and  rape;\" his wife, too, superintended the dairy with a skill which she  had brought from Kyle, and as the harvest, for a season or two, was  abundant, and the dairy yielded butter and cheese for the market, it  seemed that \"the luckless star\" which ruled his lot had relented, and  now shone unboding and benignly. But much more is required than toil  of hand to make a successful farmer, nor will the attention bestowed  only by fits and starts, compensate for carelessness or oversight:  frugality, not in one thing but in all, is demanded, in small matters  as well as in great, while a careful mind and a vigilant eye must  superintend the labours of servants, and the whole system of in-door  and out-door economy. Now, during the three years which Burns stayed  in Ellisland, he neither wrought with that constant diligence which  farming demands, nor did he bestow upon it the unremitting attention  of eye and mind which such a farm required: besides his skill in  husbandry was but moderate--the rent, though of his own fixing, was  too high for him and for the times; the ground, though good, was not  so excellent as he might have had on the same estate--he employed more  servants than the number of acres demanded, and spread for them a  richer board than common: when we have said this we need not add the  expensive tastes induced by poetry, to keep readers from starting,  when they are told that Burns, at the close of the third year of  occupation, resigned his lease to the landlord, and bade farewell for  ever to the plough. He was not, however, quite desolate; he had for a  year or more been appointed on the excise, and had superintended a  district extending to ten large parishes, with applause; indeed, it  has been assigned as the chief reason for failure in his farm, that  when the plough or the sickle summoned him to the field, he was to be  found, either pursuing the defaulters of the revenue, among the  valleys of Dumfrieshire, or measuring out pastoral verse to the  beauties of the land. He retired to a house in the Bank-vennel of  Dumfries, and commenced a town-life: he commenced it with an empty  pocket, for Ellisland had swallowed up all the profits of his poems:  he had now neither a barn to produce meal nor barley, a barn-yard to  yield a fat hen, a field to which he could go at Martinmas for a mart,  nor a dairy to supply milk and cheese and butter to the table--he had,  in short, all to buy and little to buy with. He regarded it as a  compensation that he had no farm-rent to provide, no bankruptcies to  dread, no horse to keep, for his excise duties were now confined to  Dumfries, and that the burthen of a barren farm was removed from his  mind, and his muse at liberty to renew her unsolicited strains.    But from the day of his departure from \"the barren\" Ellisland, the  downward course of Burns may be dated. The cold neglect of his country  had driven him back indignantly to the plough, and he hoped to gain  from the furrowed field that independence which it was the duty of  Scotland to have provided: but he did not resume the plough with all  the advantages he possessed when he first forsook it: he had revelled  in the luxuries of polished life--his tastes had been rendered  expensive as well as pure: he had witnessed, and he hoped for the  pleasures of literary retirement, while the hands which had led  jewelled dames over scented carpets to supper tables leaded with  silver took hold of the hilts of the plough with more of reluctance  than good-will. Edinburgh, with its lords and its ladies, its delights  and its hopes, spoiled him for farming. Nor were his new labours more  acceptable to his haughty spirit than those of the plough: the excise  for a century had been a word of opprobrium or of hatred in the  north: the duties which it imposed were regarded, not by peasants  alone, as a serious encroachment upon the ancient rights of the  nation, and to mislead a gauger, or resist him, even to blood, was  considered by few as a fault. That the brightest genius of the  nation--one whose tastes and sensibilities were so peculiarly its  own--should be, as a reward, set to look after run-rum and smuggled  tobacco, and to gauge ale-wife's barrels, was a regret and a marvel to  many, and a source of bitter merriment to Burns himself.    The duties of his situation were however performed punctually, if not  with pleasure: he was a vigilant officer; he was also a merciful and  considerate one: though loving a joke, and not at all averse to a  dram, he walked among suspicious brewers, captious ale-wives, and  frowning shop-keepers as uprightly as courteously: he smoothed the  ruggedest natures into acquiescence by his gayety and humour, and yet  never gave cause for a malicious remark, by allowing his vigilance to  slumber. He was brave, too, and in the capture of an armed smuggler,  in which he led the attack, showed that he neither feared water nor  fire: he loved, also, to counsel the more forward of the smugglers to  abandon their dangerous calling; his sympathy for the helpless poor  induced him to give them now and then notice of his approach; he has  been known to interpret the severe laws of the excise into tenderness  and mercy in behalf of the widow and the fatherless. In all this he  did but his duty to his country and his kind: and his conduct was so  regarded by a very competent and candid judge. \"Let me look at the  books of Burns,\" said Maxwell, of Terraughty, at the meeting of the  district magistrates, \"for they show that an upright officer may be a  merciful one.\" With a salary of some seventy pounds a year, the chance  of a few guineas annually from the future editions of his poems, and  the hope of rising at some distant day to the more lucrative situation  of supervisor, Burns continued to live in Dumfries; first in the  Bank-vennel, and next in a small house in a humble street, since  called by his name.    In his earlier years the poet seems to have scattered songs as thick  as a summer eve scatters its dews; nor did he scatter them less  carelessly: he appears, indeed, to have thought much less of them than  of his poems: the sweet song of Mary Morison, and others not at all  inferior, lay unregarded among his papers till accident called them  out to shine and be admired. Many of these brief but happy  compositions, sometimes with his name, and oftener without, he threw  in dozens at a time into Johnson, where they were noticed only by the  captious Ritson: but now a work of higher pretence claimed a share in  his skill: in September, 1792, he was requested by George Thomson to  render, for his national collection, the poetry worthy of the muses of  the north, and to take compassion on many choice airs, which had  waited for a poet like the author of the Cotter's Saturday Night, to  wed them to immortal verse. To engage in such an undertaking, Burns  required small persuasion, and while Thomson asked for strains  delicate and polished, the poet characteristically stipulated that his  contributions were to be without remuneration, and the language  seasoned with a sprinkling of the Scottish dialect. As his heart was  much in the matter, he began to pour out verse with a readiness and  talent unknown in the history of song: his engagement with Thomson,  and his esteem for Johnson, gave birth to a series of songs as  brilliant as varied, and as naturally easy as they were gracefully  original. In looking over those very dissimilar collections it is not  difficult to discover that the songs which he wrote for the more  stately work, while they are more polished and elegant than those  which he contributed to the less pretending one, are at the same time  less happy in their humour and less simple in their pathos. \"What  pleases _me_ as simple and naive,\" says Burns to Thomson, \"disgusts  _you_ as ludicrous and low. For this reason 'Fye, gie me my coggie,  sirs,' 'Fye, let us a' to the bridal,' with several others of that  cast, are to me highly pleasing, while 'Saw ye my Father' delights me  with its descriptive simple pathos:\" we read in these words the  reasons of the difference between the lyrics of the two collections.    The land where the poet lived furnished ready materials for song:  hills with fine woods, vales with clear waters, and dames as lovely as  any recorded in verse, were to be had in his walks and his visits;  while, for the purposes of mirth or of humour, characters, in whose  faces originality was legibly written, were as numerous in Nithsdale  as he had found them in the west. He had been reproached, while in  Kyle, with seeing charms in very ordinary looks, and hanging the  garlands of the muse on unlovely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18505"],[0,"A Popular Schoolgirl (#18)"],[1,"man  left no record of his doings beyond the weapons buried with him in his  barrow. Legend, however, like a busy gossip, had stepped in and supplied  points upon which history was silent. Traditions of the neighborhood  explained the menhirs as twelve giants turned into stone by the magic  powers of good King Arthur, who, in defiance of the claims of the isle  of Avalon, was supposed to be buried in a hitherto unexplored chamber of  the large green mound that stood near. Sometimes, so the story ran, the  giants whispered to one another, and any one who came there alone at  daybreak on May morning might glean much useful information regarding  the personal appearance of his or her future lover. As it was obviously  difficult to reach so out-of-the-way a spot at such a very early hour,  the oracles were seldom consulted at the one and only moment when they  were supposed to whisper. There were reputed, however, to be other and  easier means of gleaning knowledge from them. Ingred, who had been  priming herself with local lore, confided details of the occult  ceremonial to Quenrede.    \"It sounds rather thrillsome!\" admitted that damsel doubtfully. \"I'd  really like to try it, only the boys would tease me to death. You know  what they are!\"    \"They're going over there to photograph the cromlech. You'd have time  before they come back.\"    \"Shall I?\"    \"Go on!\"    \"Tell me again what to do.\"    \"You let your hair down, and walk bareheaded in and out and in and out  round all the circle of stones. Then you put an offering of flowers on  that biggest stone--the Giant King, he's called--and throw a pebble into  the little pool below. You count the bubbles that come up--one for A,  two for B, &c.,--and they'll give you the initial of your future lover.  With _very_ great luck, you might see his shadow in the pool, but that  does not often happen.\"    \"I don't believe in it, of course, but I'll try for fun! The Giant King  won't get much in the way of a bouquet to-day!\"    Quenrede, protesting her scepticism, but all the same palpably enjoying  the magic experiment, picked an indifferent nosegay of the few  buttercups, hawkweeds, and late pieces of scabious which were the only  flowers available. Then she removed her hair-pins, and, letting down a  shower of flaxen hair, commenced her winding pilgrimage among the old  gray stones. There is a vein of superstition in the most modern of  minds, and she was probably following a custom that had come down the  ages from the days when our primitive ancestresses clothed themselves in  skins and twisted their prehistoric locks with pins of mammoth ivory.  In and out and in and out, with Ingred, like an attendant priestess,  behind her, she performed the necessary itinerary, and laid her floral  offering upon what may have been the remains of a neolithic altar. The  pool below was dark and boggy and brown with peat. She took a good-sized  pebble, and flung it into the middle with a terrific splash. Ingred,  giggling nervously, counted the bubbles.    \"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I--It's 'I,' Queenie! No, there's another! It's  'J'! It's going to be 'J,' old sport! Aren't you thrilled? Oh, I say!  Whoever on earth is that?\"    Following the direction of her sister's eyes, Quenrede looked through a  veil of wind-blown hair, to see, standing among the stones, a stranger  of the opposite sex, garbed in tweed knickers and leather gaiters. One  glance was enough. The next second she turned, and beat a hurried and  ignominious retreat to the sheltered side of the green mound. Ingred,  panting in the rear, followed her to cover.    Quenrede, very pink in the face, sat down on a clump of heather and  immediately began to put up her hair.    \"I never felt such an idiot in my life!\" she confided with energy to her  sympathetic audience of one. \"Ingred! That man knew what I was doing! I  saw the horrid amusement in his face. He was laughing at me for all he  was worth. I _know_ he was!\"    At eighteen it is an overwhelming matter to be laughed at. Quenrede's  newly-developed dignity was decidedly wounded.    \"After all, it was a very schoolgirlish thing to do,\" she remarked,  sticking in hair-pins as well as she could without a mirror. \"Do you  think he's still there? I shall stop here till he marches off.\"    \"I'll go and prospect,\" said Ingred.    She came back with the bad news that not only was the stranger still  there, but he was actually in close and apparently familiar conversation  with Athelstane and Hereward, who were calling loudly for their sisters,  and to confirm her words came distant jodellings of:    \"Ingred!\"    \"Queenie!\"    \"Where are you girls?\"    There was nothing for it but to come forth from their retreat. It was  impossible to stay hidden forever. Quenrede issued as nonchalantly as  she could, with her hair tucked under her tam-o'-shanter, and her gloves  on. She bowed instead of shaking hands when Athelstane introduced Mr.  Broughten, a fellow-student of his college; it seemed a more grown-up  and superior attitude to adopt. She thought his eyes twinkled, but she  preserved such an air of stand-off dignity that he promptly suppressed  any undue inclinations towards mirth, and stood looking the epitome of  grave politeness.    \"Broughten knows all about the old barrow,\" Athelstane explained. \"He's  got a candle with him--we were duds not to bring one ourselves--and he's  going to act showman. Come along!\"    The entrance into the mound was through a low doorway with lintel and  posts of unhewn stone. Inside was a kind of central hall with three  rudely-constructed chambers leading out of it. A pile of rough stones in  front seemed to point to further chambers.    \"That part's never been explored yet,\" said Mr. Broughten. \"Some of us  want to tackle it some day, if we can get permission, but it's a big  job. You don't want to bring the barrow down on your head, and be buried  in the ruins! I never think the roof looks too secure,\" he added easily,  poking at the stones above with his stick.    The girls, aghast at the notion of a possible subsidence, made a hasty  exit to the open air, and hovered near the entrance in much agitation of  mind till the rest of the party made a safe reappearance. Their  conductor, with a side glance at the bunch of flowers--which Quenrede  ignored--made some reference to the Giant King stone and his whispering  companions: he was evidently well versed in all old traditions, though  he refrained from mentioning local practices. He walked part of the way  home with the Saxons before he branched off to the place where he had  left his bicycle.    [Illustration: \"YOU LOOK _NICE_--YOU DO _REALLY_, WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN\"]    \"You look _nice_--you do, _really_, with your hair down,\" said Ingred to  Quenrede that night, as the latter sat wielding her hairbrush at  bedtime. \"And you needn't be afraid anybody would mistake you for a  flapper. Why, Harry Scampton actually asked Hereward the other day if  you were married! By the by,\" she added wickedly, \"do you know I've  ascertained that Mr. Broughten's Christian name begins with 'J.' Whether  'John' or 'James' I can't say!\"    \"I don't care if it's Jehosaphat!\" snorted Queenie. \"I've told you  already he doesn't interest me in the least!\"          CHAPTER XI    On Strike      It was about this time that a general spirit of trouble and  dissatisfaction seemed to creep into the school. How and where it  started nobody knew, any more than one can trace the origin of influenza  germs. There is no epidemic more catching than grumbling, however, and  the complaint spread rapidly. It had the unfortunate effect of reacting  upon itself. The fact that the girls were restive made the teachers more  strict, and that in its turn produced fresh complaints. Miss Burd,  careful for the cause of discipline, made a new rule that any form  showing a record of a single cross for conduct would be debarred for a  week from the use of the asphalt tennis-courts, a decidedly drastic  measure, but one that in her opinion was necessary to meet the  emergency.    Though the disorder was mostly among the juniors, Va was not  altogether immune from the microbe. It really began with a quarrel  between Ingred and Beatrice Jackson. The latter was a type of girl  common enough in all large schools. She was not always scrupulously  honorable over her work, but she liked to curry favor with the  mistresses. She copied her exercises shamelessly, would surreptitiously  look up words in the midst of unseen Latin translation, and was capable  not only of other meannesses, but sometimes of a downright deliberate  fib. She and Ingred were at such opposite poles that they did not  harmonize well together. In the old days, with visions of parties at  Rotherwood, Beatrice had at least been civil, but now that there seemed  no further prospect of being asked to pleasant entertainments, she had  turned round and treated Ingred with scant politeness in general, and  sometimes with deliberate rudeness. Little things that perhaps we laugh  at afterwards, hurt very much at the time, and Ingred was passing  through an ultra sensitive phase. During the latter part of that autumn  term she detested Beatrice.    One day Miss Burd announced that on the following Saturday there was to  be a match played in a suburb of Grovebury between two first-class  ladies' hockey clubs. She suggested that it might be of advantage to  some of the girls to go and watch it, and proposed that each of the  upper forms should elect one of their number as special reporter to  write an account of the match which could be read aloud afterwards in  school. The idea rather struck them.    \"It's Finbury Wanderers _versus_ Hilton,\" said Linda Slater, \"and  they're both jolly good, I know. Wish I could have gone myself, but I'm  booked already for Saturday.\"    \"Heaps of us are,\" said Cicely Denham.    \"We'd like to hear about it, though,\" added Kitty Saunders. \"I"]]]
