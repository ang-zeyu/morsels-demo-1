When the devout  Khuniatonu exchanged one city and one god for another, he thought  that he was merely transposing equivalents, and that the safety of the  commonwealth was not concerned in the operation. Whether it was Amon or  Atonu who presided over the destinies of his people, or whether Thebes  or Tel el-Amarna were the centre of impulse, was, in his opinion, merely  a question of internal arrangement which could not affect the economy  of the whole. But events soon showed that he was mistaken in his  calculations. It is probable that if, on the expulsion of the Hyksos,  the earlier princes of the dynasty had attempted an alteration in the  national religion, or had moved the capital to any other city they might  select, the remainder of the kingdom would not have been affected by the  change. But after several centuries of faithful adherence to Amon in  his city of Thebes, the governing power would find it no easy matter  to accomplish such a resolution. During three centuries the dynasty had  become wedded to the city and to its patron deity, and the locality had  become so closely associated with the dynasty, that any blow aimed at  the god could not fail to destroy the dynasty with it; indeed, had the  experiment of Khuniatonu been prolonged beyond a few years, it might  have entailed the ruin of the whole country. All who came into contact  with Egypt, or were under her rule, whether Asiatics or Africans,  were quick to detect any change in her administration, and to remark a  falling away from the traditional systems of the times of Thutmosis III.  and Amenothes II. The successors of the heretic king had the sense to  perceive at once the first symptoms of disorder, and to refrain from  persevering in his errors; but however quick they were to undo his work,  they could not foresee its serious consequences. His immediate followers  were powerless to maintain their dynasty, and their posterity had to  make way for a family who had not incurred the hatred of Amon, or rather  that of his priests. If those who followed them were able by their tact  and energy to set Egypt on her feet again, they were at the same time  unable to restore her former prosperity or her boundless confidence in  herself.

By such a  chance alliance Harmhabi, who was himself descended from Thutmosis III.,  was raised to the kingly office.* His mother, Mutnozmit, was of the  royal line, and one of the most beautiful statues in the Gizeh Museum  probably represents her. The body is mutilated, but the head is charming  in its intelligent and animated expression, in its full eyes and  somewhat large, but finely modelled, mouth. The material of the statue  is a finegrained limestone, and its milky whiteness tends to soften the  malign character of her look and smile. It is possible that Mutnozmit  was the daughter of Amenothes III. by his marriage with one of  his sisters: it was from her, at any rate, and not from his  great-grandfather, that Harmhabi derived his indisputable claims to  royalty.**         * A fragment of an inscription at Karnak calls Thutmosis       III. \"the father of his fathers.\" Champollion called him       Hornemnob, Rosellini, Hor-hemheb, Hor-em-hbai, and both       identified him with the Horos of Manetho, hence the custom       among Egyptologists for a long time to designate him by the       name Horus. Deveria was the first to show that the name       corresponded with the Armais of the lists of Manetho, and,       in fact, Armais is the Greek transcription of the group       Harmhabi in the bilingual texts of the Ptolemaic period.         ** Mutnozmit was at first considered the daughter and       successor of Harmhabi, or his wife. Birch showed that the       monuments did not confirm these hypotheses, and he was       inclined to think that she was Harmhabi's mother. As far as       I can see for the present, it is the only solution which       agrees with the evidence on the principal monument which has       made known her existence.    He was born, probably, in the last years of Amenothes, when Tii was the  exclusive favourite of the sovereign; but it was alleged later on, when  Harmhabi had emerged from obscurity, that Amon, destining him for the  throne, had condescended to become his father by Mutnozmit--a customary  procedure with the god when his race on earth threatened to become  debased.* It was he who had rocked the newly born infant to sleep, and,  while Harsiesis was strengthening his limbs with protective amulets, had  spread over the child's skin the freshness and brilliance which are the  peculiar privilege of the immortals. While still in the nursery, the  great and the insignificant alike prostrated themselves before Harmhabi,  making him liberal offerings. Every one recognised in him, even when  still a lad and incapable of reflection, the carriage and complexion  of a god, and Horus of Cynopolis was accustomed to follow his steps,  knowing that the time of his advancement was near. After having called  the attention of the Egyptians to Harmhabi, Amon was anxious, in fact,  to hasten the coming of the day when he might confer upon him supreme  rank, and for this purpose inclined the heart of the reigning Pharaoh  towards him. Ai proclaimed him his heir over the whole land.**         * All that we know of the youth of Harmhabi is contained in       the texts on a group preserved in the Turin Museum, and       pointed out by Champollion, translated and published       subsequently by Birch and by Brugsch. The first lines of the       inscription seem to me to contain an account of the union of       Amon with the queen, analogous to those at Deir el-Bahari       treating of the birth of Hatshopsitu, and to those at Luxor       bearing upon Amenothes III. (cf. vol. iv. pp. 342, 343; and       p. 51 of the present volume), and to prove for certain that       Harmhabi's mother was a princess of the royal line by right.         ** The king is not named in the inscription. It cannot have       been Amenothes IV., for an individual of the importance of       Harmhabi, living alongside this king, would at least have       had a tomb begun for him at. Tel el-Amarna. We may hesitate       between Ai and Tutankhamon; but the inscription seems to say       definitely that Harmhabi succeeded directly to the king       under whom he had held important offices for many years, and       this compels us to fix upon Ai, who, as we have said at p.       108, et seq., of the present volume, was, to all       appearances, the last of the so-called heretical sovereigns.    He never gave cause for any dissatisfaction when called to court, and  when he was asked questions by the monarch he replied always in fit  terms, in such words as were calculated to produce serenity, and thus  gained for himself a reputation as the incarnation of wisdom, all his  plans and intentions appearing to have been conceived by Thot the  Ibis himself. For many years he held a place of confidence with the  sovereign. The nobles, from the moment he appeared at the gate of the  palace, bowed their backs before him; the barbaric chiefs from the north  or south stretched out their arms as soon as they approached him, and  gave him the adoration they would bestow upon a god.

The remaining portions of the nations who had taken part in the attack  on Egypt--of which several tribes had been planted by Ramses III. in  the Shephelah, from Gaza to Carmel--proceeded in a series of successive  detachments from Asia Minor and the AEgean Sea to the coasts of Italy  and of the large islands; the Tursha into that region which was known  afterwards as Etruria, the Shardana into Sardinia, the Zakkala into  Sicily, and along with the latter some Pulasati, whose memory is still  preserved on the northern slope of Etna. Fate thus brought the Phonician  emigrants once more into close contact with their traditional enemies,  and the hostility which they experienced in their new settlements from  the latter was among the influences which determined their further  migration from Italy proper, and from the region occupied by the  Ligurians between the Arno and the Ebro. They had already probably  reached Sardinia and Corsica, but the majority of their ships had sailed  to the southward, and having touched at Malta, Gozo, and the small  islands between Sicily and the Syrtes, had followed the coast-line of  Africa, until at length they reached the straits of Gribraltar and the  southern shores of Spain. No traces remain of their explorations, or of  their early establishments in the western Mediterranean, as the towns  which they are thought--with good reason in most instances--to have  founded there belong to a much later date. Every permanent settlement,  however, is preceded by a period of exploration and research, which may  last for only a few years or be prolonged to as many centuries. I am  within the mark, I think, in assuming that Phonician adventurers,  or possibly even the regular trading ships of Tyre and Sidon, had  established relations with the semi-barbarous chiefs of Botica as early  as the XIIth century before our era, that is, at the time when the power  of Thebes was fading away under the weak rule of the pontiffs of Amon  and the Tanite Pharaohs.    The Phoenicians were too much absorbed in their commercial pursuits  to aspire to the inheritance which Egypt was letting slip through her  fingers. Their numbers were not more than sufficient to supply men  for their ships, and they were often obliged to have recourse to their  allies or to mercenary tribes--the Leleges or Carians--in order to  provide crews for their vessels or garrisons for their trading posts;  it was impossible, therefore, for them to think of raising armies fit to  conquer or keep in check the rulers on the Orontes or in Naharaim. They  left this to the races of the interior--the Amorites and Hittites--and  to their restless ambition. The Hittite power, however, had never  recovered from the terrible blow inflicted on it at the time of the  Asianic invasion.    [Illustration: 128.jpg AZAZ--ONE OF THIS TUMULI ON THE ANCIENT HITTITE  PLAIN]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. Barthelemy.    The confederacy of feudal chiefs, which had been brought momentarily  together by Sapalulu and his successors, was shattered by the violence  of the shock, and the elements of which it was composed were engaged  henceforward in struggles with each other. At this time the entire plain  between the Amanus and the Euphrates was covered with rich cities, of  which the sites are represented to-day by only a few wretched villages  or by heaps of ruins. Arabian and Byzantine remains sometimes crown the  summit of the latter, but as soon as we reach the lower strata we find  in more or less abundance the ruins of buildings of the Greek or Persian  period, and beneath these those belonging to a still earlier time. The  history of Syria lies buried in such sites, and is waiting only for a  patient and wealthy explorer to bring it to light.* The Khati proper  were settled to the south of the Taurus in the basin of the Sajur,  but they were divided into several petty states, of which that which  possessed Carchemish was the most important, and exercised a practical  hegemony over the others. Its chiefs alone had the right to call  themselves kings of the Khati. The Patinu, who were their immediate  neighbours on the west, stretched right up to the Mediterranean above  the plains of Naharairn and beyond the Orontes; they had absorbed, it  would seem, the provinces of the ancient Alasia. Aramaeans occupied  the region to the south of the Patinu between the two Lebanon ranges,  embracing the districts of Hamath and Qobah.**         * The results of the excavations at Zinjirli are evidence of       what historical material we may hope to find in these       tumuli. See the account of the earlier results in P. von       Luschan, _Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli_, 1893.         ** The Aramaeans are mentioned by Tiglath-pileser I. as       situated between the Balikh, the Euphrates, and the Sajur.    The valleys of the Amanus and the southern slopes of the Taurus included  within them some half-dozen badly defined principalities--Samalla on the  Kara-Su,* Gurgum** around Marqasi, the Qui*** and Khilakku**** in  the classical Cilicia, and the Kasku^ and Kummukh^^ in a bend of the  Euphrates to the north and north-east of the Khati.         * The country of Samalla, in Egyptian Samalua, extended       around the Tell of Zinjirli, at the foot of the Amanus, in       the valley of Marash of the Arab historians.         ** The name has been read Gamgumu, Gaugum, and connected by       Tom-kins with the Egyptian Augama, which he reads Gagama, in       the lists of Thutmosis III. The Aramaean inscription on the       statue of King Panammu shows that it must be read Gurgumu,       and Sachau has identified this new name with that of Jurjum,       which was the name by which the province of the Amanus,       lying between Baias and the lake of Antioch, was known in       the Byzantine period; the ancient Gurgum stretches further       towards the north, around the town of Marqasi, which Tomkins       and Sachau have identified with Marash.         *** The site of the country of Qui was determined by       Schrader; it was that part of the Cilician plain which       stretches from the Amanus to the mountains of the Ketis, and       takes in the great town of Tarsus. F. Lenor-mant has pointed       out that this country is mentioned twice in the Scriptures       (1 _Kings_ x, 28 and 2 _Chron_. i. 16), in the time of       Solomon. The designation of the country, transformed into       the appellation of an eponymous god, is found in the name       Qauisaru, \"Qaui is king.\"         **** Khilakku, the name of which is possibly the same as the       Egyptian Khalakka, is the Cilicia Trachsea of classical       geographers.         ^ The country of Kashku, which has been connected with       Kashkisha, which takes the place of Karkisha in an Egyptian       text, was still a dependency of the Hittites in the time of       Tiglath-pileser. It was in the neighbourhood of the Urumu,       whose capital seems to have been Urum, the Ourima of       Ptolemy, near the bend of the Euphrates between Sumeisat and       Birejik; it extended into the Commagene of classical times,       on the borders of Melitene and the Tubal.         ^^ Kummukh lay on both sides of the Euphrates and of the       Upper Tigris; it became gradually restricted, until at       length it was conterminous with the Commagene of classical       geographers.    The ancient Mitanni to the east of Carchemish, which was so active in  the time of the later Amenothes, had now ceased to exist, and there  was but a vague remembrance of its farmer prowess. It had foundered  probably in the great cataclysm which engulfed the Hittite empire,  although its name appears inscribed once more among those of the vassals  of Egypt on the triumphal lists of Ramses III. Its chief tribes had  probably migrated towards the regions which were afterwards described by  the Greek geographers as the home of the Matieni on the Halys and in the  neighbourhood of Lake Urmiah. Aramaean kingdoms, of which the greatest  was that of Bit-Adini,* had succeeded them, and bordered the Euphrates  on each side as far as the Chalus and Balikh respectively; the ancient  Harran belonged also to them, and their frontier stretched as far as  Hamath, and to that of the Patinu on the Orontes.         * The province of Bit-Adini was specially that part of the       country which lay between the Euphrates and the Balikh, but       it extended also to other Syrian provinces between the       Euphrates and the Aprie.    It was, as we have seen, a complete breaking up of the old  nationalities, and we have evidence also of a similar disintegration in  the countries to the north of the Taurus, in the direction of the Black  Sea. Of the mighty Khati with whom Thutmosis III. had come into contact,  there was no apparent trace: either the tribes of which they were  composed had migrated towards the south, or those who had never left  their native mountains had entered into new combinations and lost even  the remembrance of their name. The Milidu, Tabal (Tubal), and Mushku  (Meshech) stretched behind each other from east to west on the confines  of the Tokhma-Su, and still further away other cities of less importance  contended for the possession of the Upper Saros and the middle region of  the Halys. These peoples, at once poor and warlike, had been attracted,  like the Hittites of some centuries previous, by the riches accumulated  in the strongholds of Syria. Eevolutions must have been frequent in  these regions, but our knowledge of them is more a matter of conjecture  than of actual evidence. Towards the year 1170 B.C. the Mushku swooped  down on Kummukh, and made themselves its masters; then pursuing their  good fortune, they took from the Assyrians the two provinces, Alzi and  Purukuzzi, which lay not far from the"]]]
