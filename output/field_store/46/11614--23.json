Another expedient, devised by the church of Rome, in this period, for  securing her power, was the institution of new religious orders, chiefly  the Dominicans and Franciscans, who proceeded with all the zeal and  success that attend novelties; were better qualified to gain the  populace than the old orders, now become rich and indolent; maintained  a perpetual rivalship with each other in promoting their gainful  superstitions; and acquired a great dominion over the minds, and  consequently over the purses, of men, by pretending a desire of poverty  and a contempt for riches. The quarrels which arose between these  orders, lying still under the control of the sovereign pontiff, never  disturbed the peace of the church, and served only as a spur to their  industry in promoting the common cause; and though the Dominicans lost  some popularity by their denial of the immaculate conception,--a  point in which they unwarily engaged too far to be able to recede with  honor,--they counterbalanced this disadvantage by acquiring more solid  establishments, by gaining the confidence of kings and princes, and  by exercising the jurisdiction assigned them of ultimate judges and  punishers of heresy. Thus the several orders of monks became a kind  of regular troops or garrisons of the Romish church; and though the  temporal interests of society, still more the cause of true piety, were  hurt, by their various devices to captivate the populace, they proved  the chief supports of that mighty fabric of superstition, and, till the  revival of true learning, secured it from any dangerous invasion.    The trial by ordeal was abolished in this reign by order of council; a  faint mark of improvement in the age.[*]    Henry granted a charter to the town of Newcastle, in which he gave the  inhabitants a license to dig coal. This is the first mention of coal in  England.    We learn from Madox,[**] that this king gave at one time one hundred  shillings to Master Henry, his poet; also the same year he orders this  poet ten pounds.    It appears from Selden, that in the forty-seventh of this reign, a  hundred and fifty temporal and fifty spiritual barons were summoned to  perform the service, due by their tenures.[***] In the thirty-fifth of  the subsequent reign, eighty-six temporal barons, twenty bishops,  and forty-eight abbots, were summoned to a parliament convened at  Carlisle.[****]         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 228.

[Illustration: 1_176_edward1.jpg EDWARD I.]            {1272.} The English were as yet so little inured to obedience under  a regular government, that the death of almost every king, since the  conquest, had been attended with disorders, and the council, reflecting  on the recent civil wars, and on the animosities which naturally  remain after these great convulsions, had reason to apprehend dangerous  consequences from the absence of the son and successor of Henry. They  therefore hastened to proclaim Prince Edward, to swear allegiance to  him, and to summon the states of the kingdom, in order to provide for  the public peace in this important conjuncture.[*]         * Rymer, vol. ii. p. 1 Walsing, p. 43. Trivet, p. 239.    Walter Giffard, archbishop of York, the earl of Cornwall, son of  Richard, king of the Romans, and the earl of Glocester, were appointed  guardians of the realm, and proceeded peaceably to the exercise of  their authority, without either meeting with opposition from any of the  people, or being disturbed with emulation and faction among themselves.  The high character acquired by Edward during the late commotions, his  military genius, his success in subduing the rebels, his moderation  in settling the kingdom, had procured him great esteem, mixed with  affection, among all orders of men; and no one could reasonably  entertain hopes of making any advantage of his absence, or of raising  disturbance in the nation. The earl of Glocester himself, whose great  power and turbulent spirit had excited most jealousy, was forward  to give proofs of his allegiance; and the other malecontents, being  destitute of a leader, were obliged to remain in submission to the  government.    Prince Edward had reached Sicily in his return from the Holy Land, when  he received intelligence of the death of his father; and he discovered a  deep concern on the occasion. At the same time, he learned the death of  an infant son, John whom his princess, Eleanor of Castile, had born him  at Acre, in Palestine; and as he appeared much less affected with that  misfortune, the king of Sicily expressed a surprise at this difference  of sentiment; but was told by Edward, that the death of a son was a  loss which he might hope to repair; the death of a father was a loss  irreparable.[*]    Edward proceeded homeward; but as he soon learned the quiet settlement  of the kingdom, he was in no hurry to take possession of the throne, but  spent near a year in France, before he made his appearance in England.    {1273.} In his passage by Chalons, in Burgundy, he was challenged by  the prince of the country to a tournament which he was preparing; and as  Edward excelled in those martial and dangerous exercises, the true image  of war, he declined not the opportunity of acquiring honor in that  great assembly of the neighboring nobles. But the image of war was here  unfortunately turned into the thing itself. Edward and his retinue were  so successful in the jousts, that the French knights, provoked at their  superiority, made a serious attack upon them, which was repulsed, and  much blood was idly shed in the quarrel.[**] This rencounter received  the name of the petty battle of Chalons.    {1274.} Edward went from Chalons to Paris, and did homage to Philip for the  dominions which he held in France.[***] He thence returned to Guienne,  and settled that province, which was in some confusion. He made  his journey to London through France; in his passage, he accommodated at  Montreuil a difference with Margaret, countess of Flanders, heiress of  that territory;[****] he was received with joyful acclamations by his  people, and was solemnly crowned at Westminster by Robert, archbishop of  Canterbury.         * Walsing. p. 44.

The king immediately applied himself to the reestablishment of his  kingdom, and to the correcting of those disorders which the civil  commotions and the loose administration of his father had introduced  into every part of government. The plan of his policy was equally  generous and prudent. He considered the great barons both as the  immediate rivals of the crown and oppressors of the people; and he  purposed, by an exact distribution of justice, and a rigid execution  of the laws, to give at once protection to the inferior orders of the  state, and to diminish the arbitrary power of the great, on which their  dangerous authority was chiefly founded. Making it a rule in his own  conduct to observe, except on extraordinary occasions, the privileges  secured to them by the Great Charter, he acquired a right to insist  upon their observance of the same charter towards their vassals and  inferiors; and he made the crown be regarded by all the gentry and  commonalty of the kingdom, as the fountain of justice, and the general  asylum against oppression.    {1275.} Besides enacting several useful statutes, in a parliament which  he summoned at Westminster, he took care to inspect the conduct of all  his magistrates and judges, to displace such as were either negligent  or corrupt, to provide them with sufficient force for the execution of  justice, to extirpate all bands and confederacies of robbers, and to  repress those more silent robberies which were committed either by the  power of the nobles or under the countenance of public authority. By  this rigid administration, the face of the kingdom was soon changed; and  order and justice took place of violence and oppression: but amidst the  excellent institutions and public-spirited plans of Edward, there still  appears somewhat both of the severity of his personal character and of  the prejudices of the times.    As the various kinds of malefactors, the murderers, robbers,  incendiaries, ravishers, and plunderers, had become so numerous and  powerful, that the ordinary ministers of justice, especially in the  western counties, were afraid to execute the laws against them, the king  found it necessary to provide an extraordinary remedy for the evil; and  he erected a new tribunal, which, however useful, would have been  deemed in times of more regular liberty, a great stretch of illegal and  arbitrary power. It consisted of commissioners, who were empowered  to inquire into disorders and crimes of all kinds, and to inflict the  proper punishments upon them. The officers charged with this unusual  commission, made their circuits throughout the counties of England most  infested with this evil, and carried terror into all those parts of  the kingdom. In their zeal to punish crimes, they did not sufficiently  distinguish between the innocent and guilty; the smallest suspicion  became a ground of accusation and trial; the slightest evidence was  received against criminals; prisons were crowded with malefactors, real  or pretended; severe fines were levied for small offences; and the king,  though his exhausted exchequer was supplied by this expedient, found it  necessary to stop the course of so great rigor, and after terrifying and  dissipating by this tribunal the gangs of disorderly people in England,  he prudently annulled the commission;[*] and never afterwards renewed  it.    Among the various disorders to which the kingdom was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#18)"],[1,"ter; and as the friends of the person murdered often in  the interval compounded matters with the criminal, the crime frequently  passed unpunished. Suits were given to the poor \"in forma pauperis,\" as  it is called; that is, without paying dues for the writs, or any fees to  the council:[**] a good law at all times, especially in that age,  when the people labored under the oppression of the great; but a law  difficult to be carried into execution. A law was made against carrying  off any woman by force.[***] The benefit of clergy was abridged;[****]  and the criminal, on the first offence, was ordered to be burned in  the hand with a letter denoting his crime; after which he was punished  capitally for any new offence. Sheriffs were no longer allowed to fine  any person, without previously summoning him before their court.[v] It  is strange that such a practice should ever have prevailed. Attaint of  juries was granted in cases which exceeded forty pounds' value; [v*] a  law which has an appearance of equity, but which was afterwards found  inconvenient. Actions popular were not allowed to be eluded by fraud or  covin. If any servant of the king's conspired against the life of the  steward, treasurer, or comptroller of the king's household, this design,  though not followed by any overt act, was made liable to the punishment  of felony.[v**] This statute was enacted for the security of Archbishop  Morton, who found himself exposed to the enmity of great numbers.    There scarcely passed any session during this reign without some statute  against engaging retainers, and giving them badges or liveries; [v***]  a practice by which they were in a manner enlisted under some great lord  and were kept in readiness to assist him in all wars, insurrections,  riots, violences, and even in bearing evidence for him in courts of  justice.[v****]         *      3 Henry VII. cap. 1.         **     11 Henry VII. cap. 12.         ***    3 Henry VII. cap. 2.         ****   4 Henry VII. cap. 13.         v      11 Henry VII. cap. 15.         v*     11 Henry VII. cap. 24.         v**    19 Henry VII. cap. 3.         v***   3 Henry VII. cap 13.         v****  3 Henry VII. cap 1 and 12.    This disorder, which had prevailed during many reigns, when the law  could give little protection to the subject, was then deeply rooted  in England; and it required all the vigilance and rigor of Henry to  extirpate it. There is a story of his severity against this abuse; and  it seems to merit praise, though it is commonly cited as an instance of  his avarice and rapacity. The earl of Oxford, his favorite general, in  whom he always placed great and deserved confidence, having splendidly  entertained him at his castle of Heningham, was desirous of making a  parade of his magnificence at the departure of his royal guest, and  ordered all his retainers, with their liveries and badges, to be drawn  up in two lines, that their appearance might be the more gallant  and splendid. \"My lord,\" said the king, \"I have heard much of your  hospitality, but the truth far exceeds the report. These handsome  gentlemen and yeomen, whom I see on both sides of me, are no doubt your  menial servants.\" The earl smiled, and confessed that his fortune was  too narrow for such magnificence. \"They are most of them,\" subjoined  he, \"my retainers, who are come to do me service at this time, when  they know I am honored with your majesty's presence.\" The king started  a little, and said, \"By my faith, my lord, I thank you for your good  cheer, but I must not allow my laws to be broken in my sight. My  attorney must speak with you.\" Oxford is said to have paid no less than  fifteen thousand marks, as a composition for his offence.    The increase of the arts, more effectually than all the severities of  law, put an end to this pernicious practice. The nobility, instead of  vying with each other in the number and boldness of their retainers,  acquired by degrees a more civilized species of emulation, and  endeavored to excel in the splendor and elegance of their equipage,  houses, and tables. The common people, no longer maintained in vicious  idleness by their superiors, were obliged to learn some calling or  industry, and became useful both to themselves and to others. And it  must be acknowledged, in spite of those who declaim so violently against  refinement in the arts, or what they are pleased to call luxury, that,  as much as an industrious tradesman is both a better man and a better  citizen than one of those idle retainers who formerly depended on the  great families, so much is the life of a modern nobleman more laudable  than that of an ancient baron.[*]    But the most important law, in its consequences, which was enacted  during the reign of Henry, was that by which the nobility and gentry  acquired a power of breaking the ancient entails, and of alienating  their estates.[*] By means of this law, joined to the beginning luxury  and refinements of the age, the great fortunes of the barons were  gradually dissipated, and the property of the commons increased  in England. It is probable that Henry foresaw and intended this  consequence; because the constant scheme of his policy consisted in  depressing the great, and exalting churchmen, lawyers, and men of new  families, who were more dependent on him.    This king's love of money naturally led him to encourage commerce, which  increased his customs; but, if we may judge by most of the laws enacted  during his reign, trade and industry were rather hurt than promoted  by the care and attention given to them. Severe laws were made against  taking interest for money, which was then denominated usury.[*] [3] Even  the profits of exchange were prohibited, as savoring of usury,[**] which  the superstition of the age zealously proscribed. All evasive contracts,  by which profits could be made from the loan of money, were also  carefully guarded against.[***] It is needless to observe how  unreasonable and iniquitous these laws, how impossible to be executed,  and how hurtful to trade, if they could take place. We may observe,  however, to the praise of this king, that sometimes, in order to promote  commerce, he lent to merchants sums of money without interest, when he  knew that their stock was not sufficient for those enterprises which  they had in view.[****]    Laws were made against the exportation of money, plate, or bullion:  [v] a precaution which serves to no other purpose than to make more be  exported.         * See note C, at the end of the volume.         ** 4 Henry VII. cap. 24. The practice of breaking entails by       means of a fine and recovery was introduced in the reign of       Edward IV.: but it was not, properly speaking, law, till the       statute of Henry VII.; which, by correcting some abuses that       attended that practice, gave indirectly a sanction to it.         ***  3 Henry VII. cap. 5.         **** 3 Henry VII. cap. 6.         v    7 Henry VII. cap. 8.    But so far was the anxiety on this head carried, that merchants alien,  who imported commodities into the kingdom, were obliged to invest in  English commodities all the money acquired by their sales, in order to  prevent their conveying it away in a clandestine manner.[*]    It was prohibited to export horses; as if that exportation did not  encourage the breed, and render them more plentiful in the kingdom.[**]  In order to promote archery, no bows were to be sold at a higher  price than six shillings and fourpence,[***] reducing money to the  denomination of our time. The only effect of this regulation must be,  either that the people would be supplied with bad bows, or none at all.  Prices were also affixed to woollen cloth,[****] to caps and hats:[v]  and the wages of laborers were regulated by law.[v*] It is evident,  that these matters ought always to be left free, and be intrusted to  the common course of business and commerce. To some it may appear  surprising, that the price of a yard of scarlet cloth should be limited  to six and twenty shillings, money of our age; that of a yard of colored  cloth to eighteen; higher prices than these commodities bear at present;  and that the wages of a tradesman, such as a mason, bricklayer, tiler,  etc., should be regulated at near tenpence a day; which is not much  inferior to the present wages given in some parts of England. Labor and  commodities have certainly risen since the discovery of the West Indies;  but not so much in every particular as is generally imagined. The  greater industry of the present times has increased the number of  tradesmen and laborers, so as to keep wages nearer a par than could be  expected from the great increase of gold and silver. And the additional  art employed in the finer manufactures has even made some of these  commodities fall below their former value. Not to mention, that  merchants and dealers, being contented with less profit than formerly,  afford the goods cheaper to their customers. It appears by a statute of  this reign,[v**] that goods bought for sixteenpence would sometimes be  sold by the merchants for three shillings.         *    3 Henry VII cap. 8.         **   11 Henry VII. cap. 13.         ***  3 Henry VII. cap. 12.         **** 4 Henry VII. cap. 8.         v    4 Henry VII. cap. 9.         v*   11 Henry VII. cap. 22.         v** 4 Henry VII. cap. 9.    The commodities whose price has chiefly risen, are butcher's meat, fowl,  and fish, (especially the latter,) which cannot be much augmented in  quantity by the increase of art and industry. The profession which then  abounded most, and was sometimes embraced by persons of the lowest rank,  was the church: by a clause of a statute, all clerks or students of  the university were forbidden to beg, without a permission from the  vice-chancellor.[*]    One great cause of the low state of industry during this period, was the  restraints put upon it; and the parliament, or rather the"]]]
