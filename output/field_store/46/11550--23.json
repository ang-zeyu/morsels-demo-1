This whiteness insensibly ascends in the  heavens, _assuming_ a tint of yellow some degrees above the horizon; the  yellow as it rises passes into orange; and this shade of orange rises  upward into the lively vermilion, which extends as far as the zenith.  From that point you will perceive in the heavens behind you the violet  succeeding the vermilion, then the azure, after it the deep blue or  indigo colour, and, last of all, the black, quite to the westward.    \"Though this display of colours presents a multitude of intermediate  shades, which rapidly succeed each other, yet at the moment the sun is  going to exhibit his disk, the dazzling white is visible in the horizon,  the pure yellow at an elevation of forty-five degrees; the fire color in  the zenith; the pure blue forty-five degrees under it, toward the west;  and in the very west the dark veil of night still lingering on the  horizon. I think I have remarked this progression between the tropics,  where there is scarcely any horizontal refraction to make the light  prematurely encroach on the darkness, as in our climates.    \"Sometimes the trade-winds, from the north-east or south-east, blow  there, card the clouds through each other, then sweep them to the west,  crossing and recrossing them over one another, like the osiers  interwoven in a transparent basket. They throw over the sides of this  chequered work the clouds which are not employed in the contexture, roll  them up into enormous masses, as white as snow, draw them out along  their extremities in the form of a crupper, and pile them upon each  other, moulding them into the shape of mountains, caverns, and rocks;  afterwards, as evening approaches, they grow somewhat calm, as if afraid  of deranging their own workmanship. When the sun sets behind this  magnificent netting, a multitude of luminous rays are transmitted  through the interstices, which produce such an effect, that the two  sides of the lozenge illuminated by them have the appearance of being  girt with gold, and the other two in the shade seem tinged with _ruddy_  orange. Four or five divergent streams of light, emanated from the  setting sun up to the zenith, _clothe_ with fringes of gold the  undeterminate summits of this celestial barrier, and strike with the  reflexes of their fires the pyramids of the collateral aerial mountains,  which then appear to consist of _silver_ and _vermilion_. At this moment  of the evening are perceptible, amidst their redoubled ridges, a  multitude of valleys extending into infinity, and distinguishing  themselves at their opening by some shade of flesh or of rose colour.    \"These celestial valleys present in their different contours inimitable  tints of white, melting away into white, or shades lengthening  themselves out without mixing over other shades. You see, here and  there, issuing from the cavernous sides of those mountains, tides of  _light_ precipitating themselves, in ingots of gold and silver, over  rocks of coral. Here it is a gloomy rock, pierced through and through,  disclosing, beyond the aperture, the pure azure of the firmament; there  it is an extensive strand, covered with sands of gold, stretching over  the rich ground of heaven; _poppy-coloured_, _scarlet_, and _green_ as  the emerald.    \"The reverberation of those western colours diffuses itself over the  sea, whose azure billows it _glazes_ with saffron and purple. The  mariners, leaning over the gunwale of the ship, admire in silence those  aerial landscapes. Sometimes this sublime spectacle presents itself to  them at the hour of prayer, and seems to invite them to lift up their  hearts with their voices to the heavens. It changes every instant into  forms as variable as the shades, presenting celestial colors and forms  which no pencil can pretend to imitate, and no language can describe.    \"Travellers who have, at various seasons, ascended to the summits of the  highest mountains on the globe, never could perceive, in the clouds  below them, any thing but a gray and lead-colored surface, similar to  that of a lake. The sun, notwithstanding, illuminated them with his  whole light; and his rays might there combine all the laws of refraction  to which our systems of physics have subjected them. Hence not a single  shade of color is employed in vain, through the universe; those  celestial decorations being made for the level of the earth, their  magnificent point of view taken from the habitation of man.    \"These admirable concerts of lights and forms, manifest only in the  lower region of the clouds the least illuminated by the sun, are  produced by laws with which I am totally unacquainted. But the whole are  reducible to five colors: yellow, a generation from white; red, a deeper  shade of yellow; blue, a strong tint of red; and black, the extreme tint  of blue. This progression cannot be doubted, on observing in the morning  the expansion of the light in the heavens. You there see those five  colors, with their intermediate shades, generating each other nearly in  this order: white, sulphur yellow, lemon yellow, yolk of egg yellow,  orange, aurora color, poppy red, full red, carmine red, purple, violet,  azure, indigo, and black. Each color seems to be only a strong tint of  that which precedes it, and a faint tint of that which follows; thus the  whole together appear to be only modulations of a progression, of which  white is the first term, and black the last.    \"Indeed trade cannot be carried on to any advantage, with the Negroes,  Tartars, Americans, and East-Indians, but through the medium of red  cloths. The testimonies of travellers are unanimous respecting the  preference universally given to this color. I have indicated the  universality of this taste, merely to demonstrate the falsehood of the  philosophic axiom, that tastes are arbitrary, or that there are in  Nature no laws for beauty, and that our tastes are the effects of  prejudice. The direct contrary of this is the truth; prejudice corrupts  our natural tastes, otherwise the same over the whole earth.    \"With red Nature heightens the brilliant parts of the most beautiful  flowers. She has given a complete clothing of it to the rose, the queen  of the garden: and bestowed this tint on the blood, the principle of  life in animals: she invests most of the feathered race, in India, with  a plumage of this color, especially in the season of love; and there are  few birds without some shades, at least, of this rich hue. Some preserve  entirely the gray or brown ground of their plumage, but glazed over with  red, as if they had been rolled in carmine; others are besprinkled with  red, as if you had blown a scarlet powder over them.    \"The red (or _rayed_) color, in the midst of the five primordial colors,  is the harmonic expression of them by way of excellence; and the result  of the union of two contraries, light and darkness. There are, besides,  agreeable tints, compounded of the oppositions of extremes. For example,  of the second and fourth color, that is, of yellow and blue, is formed  green, which constitutes a very beautiful harmony, and ought, perhaps,  to possess the second rank in beauty, among colors, as it possesses the  second in their generation. Nay, green appears to many, if not the most  beautiful tint, at least the most lovely, because it is less dazzling  than red, and more congenial to the eye.\"    Many words come under the example previously given to illustrate the  secondary character of adjectives, which should be carefully noticed by  the learner, to distinguish whether they define or describe things, or  are added to increase the distinction made by the adjectives themselves,  for both defining and describing adjectives admit of this addition; as,  _old_ English coin, New England rebelion; a mounted whip, and a _gold_  mounted sword--not a gold sword; a _very fine_ Latin scholar.    Secondary adjectives, also, admit of comparison in various ways; as,  _dearly_ beloved, a _more_ beloved, the _best_ beloved, the _very_ best  beloved brother.    Words formerly called \"prepositions,\" admit of comparison, as I have  before observed. \"Benhadad fled into an _inner_ chamber.\" The in_ner_  temple. The in_most_ recesses of the heart. The _out_ fit of a squadron.  The out_er_ coating of a vessel, or house. The ut_most_ reach of  grammar. The _up_ and _down_ hill side of a field. The up_per_ end of  the lot. The upper_most_ seats. A part _of_ the book. Take it _farther  off_. The _off_ cast. India _beyond_ the Ganges. Far beyond the  boundaries of the nation. I shall go _to_ the city. I am _near to_ the  town. _Near_ does not _qualify the verb_, for it has nothing to do with  it. I can exist in one place as well as another. It is _below_ the  surface; _very far_ below it. It is above the earth--\"high above all  height.\"    Such expressions frequently occur in the expression of ideas, and are  correctly understood; as difficult as it may have been to describe them  with the theories learned in the books--sometimes calling them one  thing, sometimes another--when their character and meaning was  unchanged, or, according to old systems, had \"no meaning at all of their  own!\"    But I fear I have gone _far_ beyond your patience, and, perhaps, entered  _deeper_ into this subject than was necessary, to enable you to discover  my meaning. I desired to make the subject _as_ distinct _as_ possible,  that all might see the important improvement suggested. I am  apprehensive even now, that some will be compelled to _think_ many  _profound thoughts_ before they will see the end of the obscurity under  which they have long been shrouded, in reference to the false rules  which they have been taught. But we have one consolation--those who are  not bewildered by the grammars they have tried in vain to understand,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#18)"],[1,"pier, you conclude from thence that  you will live forever, and that you will be more fortunate in an unknown  world than in the known world, in which you so often suffer! Consent,  then, to leave without regret this world, which causes more trouble than  pleasure to the majority of you. Resign yourselves to the order of  destiny, which decrees that you, like all other beings, should not  endure forever. But what will become of me? you ask! What you were  several millions of years ago. You were then, I do not know what; resign  yourselves, then, to become again in an instant, I do not know what;  what you were then; return peaceably to the universal home from which  you came without your knowledge into your material form, and pass by  without murmuring, like all the beings which surround you!    We are repeatedly told that religious ideas offer infinite consolation  to the unfortunate; it is pretended that the idea of the immortality of  the soul and of a happier life has a tendency to lift up the heart of  man and to sustain him in the midst of the adversities with which he is  assailed in this life. Materialism, on the contrary, is, we are told, an  afflicting system, tending to degrade man, which ranks him among brutes;  which destroys his courage, whose only hope is complete annihilation,  tending to lead him to despair, and inducing him to commit suicide as  soon as he suffers in this world. The grand policy of theologians is to  blow hot and to blow cold, to afflict and to console, to frighten and to  reassure.    According to the fictions of theology, the regions of the other life are  happy and unhappy. Nothing more difficult than to render one worthy of  the abode of felicity; nothing easier than to obtain a place in the  abode of torments that Divinity prepares for the unfortunate victims of  His eternal fury. Those who find the idea of another life so flattering  and so sweet, have they then forgotten that this other life, according  to them, is to be accompanied by torments for the majority of mortals?  Is not the idea of total annihilation infinitely preferable to the idea  of an eternal existence accompanied with suffering and gnashing of  teeth? The fear of ceasing to exist, is it more afflicting than the  thought of having not always been? The fear of ceasing to be is but an  evil for the imagination, which alone brought forth the dogma of another  life.    You say, O Christian philosophers, that the idea of a happier life is  delightful; we agree; there is no one who would not desire a more  agreeable and a more durable existence than the one we enjoy here below.  But, if Paradise is tempting, you will admit, also, that hell is  frightful. It is very difficult to merit heaven, and very easy to gain  hell. Do you not say that one straight and narrow path leads to the  happy regions, and that a broad road leads to the regions of the  unhappy? Do you not constantly tell us that the number of the chosen  ones is very small, and that of the damned is very large? Do we not  need, in order to be saved, such grace as your God grants to but few?  Well! I tell you that these ideas are by no means consoling; I prefer to  be annihilated at once rather than to burn forever; I will tell you that  the fate of beasts appears to me more desirable than the fate of the  damned; I will tell you that the belief which delivers me from  overwhelming fears in this world, appears to me more desirable than the  uncertainty in which I am left through belief in a God who, master of  His favors, gives them but to His favorites, and who permits all the  others to render themselves worthy of eternal punishments. It can be but  blind enthusiasm or folly that can prefer a system which evidently  encourages improbable conjectures, accompanied by uncertainty and  desolating fear.          CIX.--ALL RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES ARE IMAGINARY. INNATE SENSE IS BUT THE  EFFECT OF A ROOTED HABIT. GOD IS AN IDLE FANCY, AND THE QUALITIES WHICH  ARE LAVISHED UPON HIM DESTROY EACH OTHER.    All religious principles are a thing of imagination, in which experience  and reason have nothing to do. We find much difficulty in conquering  them, because imagination, when once occupied in creating chimeras which  astonish or excite it, is incapable of reasoning. He who combats  religion and its phantasies by the arms of reason, is like a man who  uses a sword to kill flies: as soon as the blow is struck, the flies and  the fancies return to the minds from which we thought to have banished  them.    As soon as we refuse the proofs which theology pretends to give of the  existence of a God, they oppose to the arguments which destroy them, an  innate conviction, a profound persuasion, an invincible inclination  inherent in every man, which brings to him, in spite of himself, the  idea of an Almighty being which he can not altogether expel from his  mind, and which he is compelled to recognize in spite of the strongest  reasons that we can give him. But if we wish to analyze this innate  conviction, upon which so much weight is placed, we will find that it is  but the effect of a rooted habit, which, making them close their eyes  against the most demonstrative proofs, leads the majority of men, and  often the most enlightened ones, back to the prejudices of childhood.  What can this innate sense or this ill-founded persuasion prove against  the evidence which shows us that what implies contradiction can not  exist?    We are told, very gravely, that it is not demonstrated that God does not  exist. However, nothing is better demonstrated, notwithstanding all that  men have told us so far, than that this God is an idle fancy, whose  existence is totally impossible, as nothing is more evident or more  clearly demonstrated than that a being can not combine qualities so  dissimilar, so contradictory, so irreconcilable as those which all the  religions of the earth ascribe to Divinity. The theologian's God, as  well as the God of the theist, is He not evidently a cause incompatible  with the effects attributed to Him? In whatever light we may look upon  it, we must either invent another God, or conclude that the one which,  for so many centuries, has been revealed to mortals, is at the same time  very good and very wicked, very powerful and very weak, immutable and  changeable, perfectly intelligent and perfectly destitute of reason, of  plan, and of means; the friend of order and permitting disorder; very  just and very unjust; very skillful and very awkward. Finally, are we  not obliged to admit that it is impossible to reconcile the discordant  attributes which are heaped upon a being of whom we can not say a single  word without falling into the most palpable contradictions? Let us  attempt to attribute but a single quality to Divinity, and what is said  of it will be contradicted immediately by the effects we assign to this  cause.          CX.--EVERY RELIGION IS BUT A SYSTEM IMAGINED FOR THE PURPOSE OF  RECONCILING CONTRADICTIONS BY THE AID OF MYSTERIES.    Theology could very properly be defined as the science of  contradictions. Every religion is but a system imagined for the purpose  of reconciling irreconcilable ideas. By the aid of habitude and terror,  we come to persist in the greatest absurdities, even when they are the  most clearly exposed. All religions are easy to combat, but very  difficult to eradicate. Reason can do nothing against habit, which  becomes, as is said, a second nature. There are many persons otherwise  sensible, who, even after having examined the ruinous foundations of  their belief, return to it in spite of the most striking arguments.    As soon as we complain of not understanding religion, finding in it at  every step absurdities which are repulsive, seeing in it but  impossibilities, we are told that we are not made to conceive the truths  of the religion which is proposed to us; that wandering reason is but an  unfaithful guide, only capable of conducting us to perdition; and what  is more, we are assured that what is folly in the eyes of man, is wisdom  in the eyes of God, to whom nothing is impossible. Finally, in order to  decide by a single word the most insurmountable difficulties which  theology presents to us on all sides, they simply cry out: \"Mysteries!\"          CXI.--ABSURDITY AND INUTILITY OF THE MYSTERIES FORGED IN THE SOLE  INTEREST OF THE PRIESTS.    What is a mystery? If I examine the thing closely, I discover very soon  that a mystery is nothing but a contradiction, a palpable absurdity, a  notorious impossibility, on which theologians wish to compel men to  humbly close the eyes; in a word, a mystery is whatever our spiritual  guides can not explain to us.    It is advantageous for the ministers of religion that the people should  not comprehend what they are taught. It is impossible for us to examine  what we do not comprehend. Every time that we can not see clearly, we  are obliged to be guided. If religion was comprehensible, priests would  not have so many charges here below.    No religion is without mysteries; mystery is its essence; a religion  destitute of mysteries would be a contradiction of terms. The God which  serves as a foundation to natural religion, to theism or to deism, is  Himself the greatest mystery to a mind wishing to dwell upon Him.          CXII.--CONTINUATION.    All the revealed religions which we see in the world are filled with  mysterious dogmas, unintelligible principles, of incredible miracles, of  astonishing tales which seem imagined but to confound reason. Every  religion announces a concealed God, whose essence is a mystery;  consequently, it is just as difficult to conceive of His conduct as of  the essence of this God Himself. Divinity has never spoken to us but in  an enigmatical and mysterious way in the various religions which have  been founded in the different regions of our globe. It has revealed  itself everywhere but to announce mysteries, that is to say,"]]]
