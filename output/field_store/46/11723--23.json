At the  fort, his Indian father, Whingy Pooshies, bade him stand up before the  officers, and then spoke to him.    \"My son, these are men the same color as yourself, and some of your kin  may be here, or they may be a great way off. You have lived a long time  with us. I call on you to say if I have not been a father to you, if I  have not used you as a father would a son.\"    \"You have used me as well as a father could use a son,\" said Brickell.    \"I am glad you say so,\" Whingy Pooshies returned. \"You have lived long  with me; you have hunted for me; but your treaty says you must be free.  If you choose to go with the people of your own color, I have no right  to say a word; if you choose to stay with me, your people have no right  to speak. Now reflect on it, and take your choice, and tell us as soon  as you make up your mind.\"    Brickell says that he thought of the children he had left crying, and of  all the Indians whom he loved; but he remembered his own people at last,  and he answered, \"I will go with my kin.\"    Then Whingy Pooshies said, \"I have reared you; I have taught you to  hunt; you are a good hunter; you are better to me than my own sons. I am  now getting old and I cannot hunt. I thought you would be a support to  my old age. I leaned on you as on a staff. Now it is broken; you are  going to leave me; and I have no right to say a word, but I am ruined.\"    [Illustration: Brickell leaves his Indian Father 133]    He sank into his seat, weeping, and Brickell wept too; then they parted  and never saw each other again.    One of the later captivities was that of Israel Donolson, who has told  the story himself. The night before he was captured, he says that he  dreamed of Indians, and took it as a sign of coming trouble; but in  the morning, the 22d of April, 1791, he went prospecting for land with  another young surveyor, named Lytte, and a friend named Tittle. They  worked together along the Ohio River in Adams County till they came  to one of the ancient works of the Mound Builders. The surveyors were  joking Tittle, and telling him what a fine place that would be for him  to build his house, when they saw a party of Frenchmen in two canoes.  The Frenchmen turned out to be Indians, who landed and instantly gave  chase to the white men. Donolson tripped and fell, and three warriors  were quickly upon him. He offered no resistance; they helped him up,  and had leisure to secure him in full sight of the blockhouse on the  Kentucky shore, where they could all see men moving about, but Donolson  could not call to them for help. His captors pushed off with him  northward. The next morning it rained, and one of the Indians took  Donolson's hat; he complained to a large warrior, who gave him a blanket  cap, and helped him through the swollen streams. When they killed a  bear, and wanted to make their captive carry the meat, he flung it down;  and then his big friend carried it for him.    One day an Indian, while they were resting, built a little fence of  sticks, and planted some grains of corn inside of it, saying, \"Squaw!\"  as a hint to Donolson that he should be put to work with the women. When  they got to the Shawnee camp, they dressed his hair in Indian fashion,  and put a tin jewel in his nose, and upon the whole they treated him  kindly enough. But almost every day he saw war parties setting off  for Kentucky, or coming back with scalps and horses, and he was always  watching for a chance to escape. One night he encamped with two guards  who had bound him as usual with a rope of bark. He gnawed at it all  night long, and just at daybreak he freed himself. After his first dash  he stopped to put on his moccasins, and knew that he was missed, by the  terrific yells that the Indians were giving. He ran on, and to hide his  trail kept as much as he could on fallen trees. At ten o'clock he hid  between two logs and slept till dark; then he started again, and passed  that night in a hollow tree. The day following he came to the Miami  River, and tried to drift down its current on a raft which he made of  logs tied together with bark, but he was soon forced to the shore again.  He broke his long fast on two eggs he found in a wild turkey's nest;  they proved to have each two yolks, and he made them last for two days.  In the woods he caught a horse and tried to ride it with a bark halter;  but the halter rubbed a sore on its lip, and the horse threw him, and  hurt him so badly that he lay insensible for a time; then he rose up  and pressed on, but very slowly, for his feet were full of thorns. The  twelfth day after his capture he heard the sound of an ax, and found  himself in the neighborhood of Fort Washington, or Cincinnati.    In 1793, the year before Wayne's victory, Andrew Ellison was taken  by the Indians in a clearing near his cabin in Adams County, and was  hurried off before his family knew that anything had happened. They  roused the neighborhood, and the Indians were hotly pursued, but they  got away with their prisoner, and made swiftly off to Upper Sandusky,  where they forced him to run the gantlet. He was a heavy man, not fleet  of foot, and he was terribly beaten; but he got through alive, and at  Detroit a British officer ransomed him for a hundred dollars. By that  time prisoners must have been getting cheap: it was perhaps more and  more difficult to hold them.    Two boys, John Johnson, thirteen years old, and Henry Johnson, eleven,  were captured in 1788 near their home at Beach Bottom in Monroe County.  They were cracking nuts in the woods, and when the Indians came upon  them the boys thought that they were two of their neighbors. They were  seized and hurried away, one Indian going before and one following the  boys, who told them their father treated them badly, and tried to make  their captors believe they were glad to be leaving home. The Indians  spent the day in a vain attempt to steal horses, and stopped to pass  the night only four miles from the place where they had taken the boys.  After supper they lay down with the prisoners between them, and when  they supposed the boys were asleep one of the Indians went and stretched  himself on the other side of the fire. Presently he began snoring, and  John rose, cocked one of the guns, and left it with Henry aimed at this  Indian's head, while he took his station with a tomahawk held over the  head of the other. Henry fired and John struck at the same time; neither  Indian was killed at once, but both were too badly hurt to prevent the  boys' escape, and the brothers found their way to the settlement by  daybreak. The neighbors who returned to their camp with them found the  body of the Indian who had been tomahawked, but the other had vanished.  Years afterwards a skeleton with a gun was discovered in the woods,  where he must have crept after he was shot.    In the autumn of 1792 Samuel Davis and William Campbell set out from  Massie's Station, now Manchester, to trap beaver on the Big Sandy. One  night as they lay asleep beside their camp fire they were roused by a  voice saying in broken English, \"Come, come; get up, get up!\" and they  woke to find themselves in the clutches of a large party of Indians  returning from a raid into Virginia. The Indians bound their captives  and started, driving before them a herd of stolen horses. They crossed  the Ohio country, and pushed on toward Sandusky, for they were Shawnees.  At night they tied each prisoner with buffalo thongs and made these fast  to the waist of two Indians, who lay down one on either side of him, and  quieted him with blows if he became restive. At daylight the captives  were untied, but they were warned that they would be instantly killed  if they attempted to escape. Davis was in dread of being burned at  Sandusky, and as the Indians, encumbered with their booty, made only  ten or twelve miles a day, the terror had full time to grow upon him. At  last one morning just before dawn he woke one of the Indians beside  him and asked to be untied; he was answered with a blow of the savage's  fist. He waited a moment, and then woke the other guard, who lifted his  head, and seeing some of his people building a fire, released Davis.    It was still too dark for any of them to get a good shot at him if he  made a dash from their midst, and Davis decided to try for life and  liberty. He knocked a large warrior before him into the fire, bounded  over him, burst through the group around him, and before they could  seize their rifles, which were all stacked together, he had vanished in  the shadows of the forest. They followed him, whooping and yelling, but  none could draw a bead on him, and not a shot was fired. One Indian  was so near that Davis fancied he felt his grasp at times, but he fell  behind, and Davis kept on. When he had distanced them all, he stopped  to tear up his waistcoat, and wrap his feet, naked and bleeding from the  sharp stones which had cut them in his wild flight, and then hurried  on toward the Ohio. Three days without food or fire, in the cold of the  early winter, passed before he reached the river, eight or ten miles  below the mouth of the Scioto. He then saw a large boat coming down the  stream, but his troubles did not end with this joyful sight. One of  the dreadful facts of the dreadful time was the frequent deception of  boatmen by Indians and renegades who pretended to be escaping prisoners,  and who lured them to their destruction by piteous appeals for help. The  boatmen now refused to land for Davis; they told him they had heard  too many stories like his, and they kept on down the stream, while he  followed wearily along the shore. At last he entreated them to row in  a little nearer, so that he could swim out to them. They consented to  this, and he plunged into the icy water, and was taken on board just as  his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],[0,"Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#18)"],[1,"heads in token of submission.  Several towns also sent  their chiefs and submitted in this manner, bringing peace offerings,  when the sheikh swore solemnly not to molest them further.  Their  principal leader, Malem Fanaamy, fearing to lose his head, would not  come; but offered to pay two thousand slaves, a thousand bullocks, and  three hundred horses as the price of peace.  The offer was refused; and,  compelled by his people, Malem Fanaamy made his appearance, poorly  dressed, with an uncovered head.  The sheikh received his submission;  and, when he really expected to hear the order for his throat to be cut,  he was clothed with eight handsome _tobes_, and his head made as big as  six, with turbans from Egypt.  This matter being settled, the army  returned to the capital.    Major Denham soon after this visited a caravan which had come from  Soudan, on its way to Fezzan.  The merchants had nearly a hundred  slaves, the greater part female, mostly very young--those from Nyffe of  a deep copper colour, and beautifully formed; the males were also young,  and linked together in couples by iron rings round their legs, yet they  laughed and seemed in good condition.  It is a common practice with the  merchants to induce one slave to persuade his companions that on  arriving at Tripoli they will be free and clothed in red--a colour of  which negroes are passionately fond.  By these promises they are induced  to submit quietly until they are too far from their homes to render  escape possible.    An extraordinary event occurred here, showing the despotic power of the  sheikh.  Barca Gana, his general, a governor of six large districts, had  offended the sheikh, who sent for him, had him stripped in his presence,  and a leathern girdle put round his loins, and, after reproaching him  with his ingratitude, ordered that he should be forthwith sold to the  Tibboo merchants, for he was still a slave.  The other chiefs, however,  falling on their knees, petitioned that their favourite general might be  forgiven.  The culprit at that moment appeared to take his leave.  The  sheikh, on this, threw himself back on his carpet, wept like a child,  and suffered Barca Gana to embrace his knees, and, calling them all his  sons, pardoned his penitent slave.    Poor Dr Oudney had never risen since his return from Munga, and  Clapperton and Hillman were also dangerously ill.    News now arrived that a caravan was on its way from the north.  This was  gratifying intelligence, as the expedition hoped to obtain letters and  remittances by it.    Hillman had manufactured some carriages for two brass guns, which had  been sent to the sheikh from Tripoli.  The sheikh was delighted when the  major, the only person capable of attending to them, fired them off.  He  now thought himself able to attack all who might become hostile to him.    On the 14th of December Mr Clapperton and Dr Oudney, having somewhat  recovered, set out with a large _kafila_, bound to Kano in Soudan.  Dr  Oudney, however, was in a very unfit state to travel, being almost in  the last stage of consumption.  A few days after they had gone, a  _kafila_ arrived from the north, and with it came a young ensign of the  80th Regiment, Mr Toole, who had taken the place of Mr Tyrwhit,  detained on account of sickness.  Major Denham was much pleased with his  appearance and manners--his countenance, indeed, being an irresistible  letter of introduction.  He had made the long journey from Tripoli to  Bornou in three months and fourteen days, arriving with only the loss of  five camels.  Denham's spirits revived with the society of so pleasant a  friend, and he determined to take the first opportunity of visiting the  Shary and Loggun.  The sheikh willingly gave them permission, appointing  a handsome negro, Belial, to act as their guide and manager.  He was  altogether a superior person, and was attended by six slaves.  These,  with themselves and personal attendants, formed their party.    Their journey was commenced on the 23rd of January, 1824.  After leaving  Angornou, they proceeded east, along the borders of the lake, to Angala,  where resided Miram, the divorced wife of the sheikh, El Kanemy, in a  fine house--her establishment exceeding sixty persons.  She was a very  handsome, beautifully-formed negress about thirty-five, and had much of  the softness of manner so extremely prepossessing in the sheikh.  She  received her visitors seated on an earthen throne covered with a Turkey  carpet, and surrounded by twenty of her favourite slaves, all dressed  alike in fine white shirts which reached to their feet; their necks,  ears, and noses thickly ornamented with coral.  A negro dwarf, measuring  scarcely three feet, the keeper of her keys, sat before her,  richly-dressed in Soudan _tobes_.    The Shary was reached on the 23rd.  The travellers were surprised at the  magnitude of the stream, which appeared to be fully half a mile in  width, running at the rate of two or three miles an hour towards the  Chad.    Remaining some days at the town of Showy on the banks of the river, they  embarked, accompanied by the _kaide_, or governor, and eight canoes  carrying ten slaves each.  After a voyage of nearly eight hours, they  reached a spot thirty-five miles from Showy.  The scenery was highly  interesting: one noble reach succeeded another, alternately varying  their courses; the banks thickly scattered with trees, rich in foliage,  hung over with creepers bearing variously-coloured and aromatic  blossoms.  Several crocodiles were seen, which rolled into the stream  and disappeared as they approached.    After proceeding further down the river, they returned to Showy, and  then made another excursion up the stream.    With much grief Denham perceived symptoms of illness in his companion,  who, however, complained but little.  While he was suffering they  reached a place which is so infested by flies and bees that the  inhabitants cannot move out of their houses during the day.    Their houses are literally formed one cell within another, five or six  in number, in order to prevent the ingress of the insects.  One of their  party, who went out, returned with his eyes and head in such a state  that he was ill for three days.    Hence they moved on to Zarmawha, an independent sultan, who had twice  been in rebellion against the sheikh.  Belial was received with scant  courtesy; but the sultan was very civil to the white men, to whom he  sent a variety of dishes of food, and was highly pleased with the  presents he received, observing that the English were a race of sultans.    Mr Toole's sufferings increased, though they managed to reach Loggun,  on the banks of the Shary.  As they approached, a person, apparently of  consequence, advanced towards them, bending nearly double and joining  his hands, followed by his slaves, stooping still lower than himself.  He explained that he was deputed by the sultan to welcome the white men,  and, preceding their party, conducted them to a habitation which had  been prepared for them, consisting of four separate huts, well-built  within an outer wall, with a large entrance-hall for their servants.    Next morning Denham was sent for to appear before the sultan, when he  was preceded through the streets by ten immense negroes of high birth,  with grey beards, bare heads, and carrying large clubs.  After passing  through several dark rooms, he was conducted to a large square court,  where some hundred persons were assembled, seated on the ground.  In the  middle was a vacant space to which he was led, and desired to sit down.  Two slaves in striped cotton _tabes_, who were fanning the air through a  lattice work of cane, pointed out the retirement of the sultan.  This  shade was removed, and something alive was discovered on a carpet,  wrapped up in silk _tobes_, with the head enveloped in shawls, and  nothing but the eyes visible.  The whole court prostrated themselves and  poured sand on their heads, while eight _frum-frums_ and as many horns  blew a loud and very harsh-sounding salute.    This great man, however, was not above doing a stroke of business, for,  after enquiring whether the major wished to buy female slaves, he  observed: \"If you do, go no further; I have some hundreds, and will sell  them to you as cheap as anyone.\"    Though a much handsomer race than the Bornouese, the Loggun people are  thieves, and, judging from their chiefs, great rascals.  It appeared  that there were two sultans, father and son, both of whom applied to the  major for poison that would not lie, to be used against each other, the  younger one offering him three female slaves as a bribe.    The province of which Loggun is the capital, is called Begharmi.  The  people are in many respects similar to the Bornouese, with whom they are  constantly at war.  They possess a strong force of cavalry, clothed in  suits of thick quilted armour, with helmets of the same material, easily  penetrated however by bullets, though impervious to arrows.  Their  horses are also covered in the manner of their riders.  So unwieldy are  these warriors, that they require to be assisted when mounting their  steeds.  Their weapons are long, double-headed spears, something like  pitchforks with flattened prongs.    Shortly after this a large body of them, five thousand strong, with two  hundred chiefs were defeated by the Bornouese, when all the chiefs and a  considerable number of the men were slain.    The Loggunese, however, have made considerable progress in the arts of  peace.  The clothes woven by them are superior to those of Bornou, being  beautifully glazed, and finely dyed with indigo; and they make use even  of a current coin of iron, somewhat in the form of a horse-shoe, which  none of the neighbouring nations possess.  Their country abounds in  grain and cattle, and is diversified with forests of acacias and other  beautiful trees.    As they proceeded on their"]]]
