He  was, in truth, a worthy and good man; somewhat narrow of mind and  bigoted of creed, it may be, but utterly incapable of committing an  ungenerous or dishonorable action. Still, greatly as he loved his  winsome daughter, much as he prized her for that dead woman's sake, who,  as long as she lay in his bosom, had brought him comfort, and happiness,  and honor, he was something over-harsh with her, niggardly in the  bestowing of caresses, and liberal in the gift of unnecessary rebuke.  Very severe, then, was his displeasure, when she confessed to him, with  many blushes, that she loved her young Episcopalian kinsman, John  Percival.    The cousins had not been reared together, nor had they even met before  the youth had passed his twenty-fifth, the girl her nineteenth year. But  we are not of the opinion that young people are the more prone to fall  in love with each other for the being educated together in a sort of  family domesticity. Such facts are contended for in fiction, but  realities have convinced us that such things seldom happen; and if we  ever have the fortune to possess children of our own, and wish a son or  daughter to wed a particular individual, we shall take good care, not  only to conceal our intentions from them, but to keep the pair apart  from all brother-and-sister communism, until such time as each heart  begins to have its natural craving for a congenial spirit,--when, in  sooth, it looks for others than brothers and sisters to cling to. It is  a very old, perhaps a very vulgar proverb, that \"familiarity breeds  contempt;\" and we assuredly think, that the constant fireside  association of young folks, trained up together in bread-and-butter  ease, is more apt to generate calm friendship than warm affection.    But, as we have said, our cousins were brought up asunder; he in  England, of which country his father was an eminent physician lately  deceased, who had bequeathed to his only son his professional ability,  with ample means of commencing his career in a handsome manner. When he  first came to Scotland to visit his mother's sister, he found her a  corpse; and there, in the house of mourning, the consoler of the  motherless Barbara, he learnt to love her with a sincerity of affection  to which she fully responded. Great was his vexation and surprise to  receive a stern denial of his suit from the minister, who, although he  had never testified any degree of partiality for his wife's nephew, had,  nevertheless, evinced no dislike of him. But when respectfully called  upon to assign a reason for so unexpected a rejection, he briefly said,  that \"no child of his should with his blessing wed any man who was not a  strict Presbyterian; and that, moreover, he had other views for his  daughter.\" Nor were the tears of his child, nor the intercession in  their favor of his kindhearted but timid old maiden sister, of any  effect. His obstinacy was not to be subdued, nor his will opposed; and  the unrelenting preacher, who taught humility, love, and concord from  his pulpit, and who could produce not one sensible reason for thwarting  the attachment of two amiable creatures, concluded the scene by flying  into a furious passion, in which he gave John Percival clearly to  understand, that he was no longer an acceptable, or even permitted,  guest.    The young man left the manse immediately, and was not slow in quitting  Scotland; but love, which teaches many things, taught the kinsfolk means  of keeping up, though at rare intervals, an epistolary communion--so  frequently the one sustaining prop of two divided hearts!    A year or more passed, finding them true to each other. Barbara refused  several excellent proposals of marriage, nor did her father persecute  her with expressed wishes for her acceptance of any of them; until, at  length, he introduced to her one Mr. Bruce, a wealthy cloth-merchant  from Glasgow. He was a man of about fifty years of age, of a  well-favored and portly presence, and accounted a sure and somewhat sour  follower of Mr. Comyn's favorite creed. Barbara had frequently heard her  father speak highly of his Glasgow friend, but as no warning had  prepared her, she was very far from dreaming of the character he was  about to perform in her presence; and, indeed, the wooing of the honest  clothier was neither very active nor oppressive--but, alas, for all  that, it was steadfast and resolute.    A wonderful deal of what they deemed \"religious discussion\" was carried  on betwixt Mr. Bruce and the minister during the visit of the former at  the manse, which, we have omitted to state, (though for certain reasons  we do not intend to give it a name,) was situated out of the town of  Aberdeen, in a retired strath or valley, full of hazels and sloe-bushes,  with the Dee running through them like a huge silver snake. Although  little more than half a mile from Aberdeen, and much nearer the church  of which Mr. Comyn was minister, the manse seemed as lonely and quiet as  if thirty miles lay between it and a busy, populous town. Now, though  Mr. Bruce had hired a sleeping apartment in the cottage of Mr. Comyn's  bell-man, or sexton, which stood hard by the kirk, he spent all his  spare time with his friend at the manse, where his meals were invariably  taken; and in addition to the wonderful amount of polemical palaver we  have hinted at, a wonderful deal of whisky-toddy did the worthy minister  and his guest contrive to swallow in the heat of their arguments. Many a  time and oft did good, innocent Miss Henny Comyn declare, that when the  shake-hands hour arrived, Mr. Bruce, \"puir man, seemed to toddle aff to  his cosie beddie at Davy Bain's marvellously fu' o' the spirit!\" True it  was; but the ancient virgin guessed not in her guilelessness, that the  spirit was an evil one, and elicited by man and fire from the  unsuspecting barleycorn.    At last, as we have said, Mr. Comyn spoke out his wish--nay, his  commands--that Barbara should prepare to receive Mr. Bruce as a  bridegroom in six months thereafter. And now Mr. Bruce himself, a shy  and dour man at other times, found courage one day, after dinner, to  express his--\"love;\" so he really called it, and so we suppose must we,  in our extreme ignorance of the precise category of nomenclature to  which the feelings that actuated him belonged. Honest man! bigoted and  selfish as he was, he was neither cruel by nature nor cross-grained; and  he was even moved by the pathetic and frank avowal which Barbara made to  him on the state of her heart. But, though touched by her tears, he  understood them not, treated them but as the natural mawkishness of  girlish sentimentality; nor had her assurance that she could never love  any one but her cousin John, power to dissuade him from the prosecution  of his suit. He was void of all delicacy of feeling, was neither hurt  nor displeased with her confessed partiality for another, but satisfied  himself by quoting, misquoting, and utterly perverting Scripture, and  concluded by assuring her that it was her bounden duty to obey her  father _before_ marriage--her husband _after_. He had no doubt she would  be very happy as his wife, for \"he was rich, and a steady Presbyterian!\"  And with this declaration, threatening a return in six months to claim  her hand--which he had the audacity to kiss--he left her for his Glasgow  warehouses.    In this dire dilemma the poor lassie knew not what course to pursue. Her  aunt, although kind, indulgent, and pitying her, (for in youth she had  had experience of a blighted affection, and no woman-heart, that is not  naturally sour, passes through such trial without becoming  sweeter)--was bound in complete serfdom to her brother, and was quite  unable to suggest any means or likelihood of release; so Barbara wrote a  full account of her predicament to her lover. Not long afterward, so  cleverly disguised by dress as to deceive even herself, Percival was  again at Aberdeen--determined, should all other methods fail, to carry  off his kinswoman on the very eve of the bridal; and many a twilight  evening, when the minister sat over books or took his after-dinner nap,  did those two young creatures meet, unnoticed and unsuspected, on the  banks of the Dee. But those meetings must soon end, for six months have  passed, and Mr. Bruce--once more lodged in the house of Davy Bain--is  come to wed and take home his reluctant bride.    One evening--it was cloudy and threatened foul weather, though the  summer air was warm and surcharged with flower-scents--John Percival  betook himself as usual to the customary trysting-place. It was a thick  copse of hazel past which ran--heard but not seen--the river; which,  where the shrubbery ended, formed a dark, deep pool, so garnished by  overhanging nut-trees that it had acquired the name of the Nut-hole.  Beyond this pool lay the road to the manse; but as the trees here ceased  to offer concealment, the Nut-tree-hole became the limits to Percival's  attendance on his cousin in her way homeward. The rustic seat in the  centre of the coppice was still unoccupied, and he began to fear that  something had transpired to prevent her from coming. It was no use to  listen for the sounds of her light, advancing footsteps; for the Dee  made so loud and incessant a sough as it tumbled from the steep bank  that helped to form the Nut-hole, that it drowned all lesser sounds.    He was, however, soon made conscious that there were sounds which no  sough of tumbling waters could drown; for, on a sudden, neither remote  nor suppresed, a fierce, a pitiful cry, like that of one in some dread  life-peril, struck upon his ears, succeeded by the breaking asunder of  the boughs of trees, and then a plunge in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],[0,"The Angel of Terror (#18)"],[1,"a resemblance.    \"Have you had your driver long?\" she asked as they were running through  Monte Carlo, along the sea road.    \"Mordon? Yes, we have had him six or seven years,\" said Jean  carelessly. \"He drives us when we are on the continent, you know. He  speaks French perfectly and is an excellent driver. Father has tried to  persuade him to come to England, but he hates London--he was telling me  the other day that he hadn't been there for ten years.\"    That disposed of the resemblance, thought Lydia, and yet--she could  remember his voice, she thought, and when they alighted on the Promenade  des Anglaise she spoke to him. He replied in French, and it is  impossible to detect points of resemblance in a voice that speaks one  language and the same voice when it speaks another.    The promenade was crowded with saunterers. A band was playing by the  jetty and although the wind was colder than it had been at Cap Martin  the sun was warm enough to necessitate the opening of a parasol.    It was a race week, and the two girls lunched at the Negrito. They were  in the midst of their meal when a man came toward them and Lydia  recognised Mr. Marcus Stepney. This dark, suave man was no favourite of  hers, though why she could not have explained. His manners were always  perfect and, towards her, deferential.    As usual, he was dressed with the precision of a fashion-plate. Mr.  Marcus Stepney was a man, a considerable portion of whose time was  taken up every morning by the choice of cravats and socks and shirts.  Though Lydia did not know this, his smartness, plus a certain dexterity  with cards, was his stock in trade. No breath of scandal had touched  him, he moved in a good set and was always at the right place at the  proper season.    When Aix was full he was certain to be found at the Palace, in the  Deauville week you would find him at the Casino punting mildly at the  baccarat table. And after the rooms were closed, and even the Sports  Club at Monte Carlo had shut its doors, there was always a little game  to be had in the hotels and in Marcus Stepney's private sitting-room.    And it cannot be denied that Mr. Stepney was lucky. He won sufficient at  these out-of-hour games to support him nobly through the trials and  vicissitudes which the public tables inflict upon their votaries.    \"Going to the races,\" he said, \"how very fortunate! Will you come along  with me? I can give you three good winners.\"    \"I have no money to gamble,\" said Jean, \"I am a poor woman. Lydia, who  is rolling in wealth, can afford to take your tips, Marcus.\"    Marcus looked at Lydia with a speculative eye.    \"If you haven't any money with you, don't worry. I have plenty and you  can pay me afterwards. I could make you a million francs to-day.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Jean coolly, \"but Mrs. Meredith does not bet so  heavily.\"    Her tone was a clear intimation to the man of wits that he was impinging  upon somebody else's preserves and he grinned amiably.    Nevertheless, it was a profitable afternoon for Lydia. She came back to  Cap Martin twenty thousand francs richer than she had been when she  started off.    \"Lydia's had a lot of luck she tells me,\" said Mr. Briggerland.    \"Yes. She won about five hundred pounds,\" said his daughter. \"Marcus was  laying ground bait. She did not know what horses he had backed until  after the race was run, when he invariably appeared with a few _mille_  notes and Lydia's pleasure was pathetic. Of course she didn't win  anything. The twenty thousand francs was a sprat--he's coming to-night  to see how the whales are blowing!\"    Mr. Marcus Stepney arrived punctually, and, to Mr. Briggerland's  disgust, was dressed for dinner, a fact which necessitated the older  man's hurried retreat and reappearance in conventional evening wear.    Marcus Stepney's behaviour at dinner was faultless. He devoted himself  in the main to Mrs. Cole-Mortimer and Jean, who apparently never looked  at him and yet observed his every movement, knew that he was merely  waiting his opportunity.    It came when the dinner was over and the party adjourned to the big  stoep facing the sea. The night was chilly and Mr. Stepney found wraps  and furs for the ladies, and so manoeuvred the arrangement of the chairs  that Lydia and he were detached from the remainder of the party, not by  any great distance, but sufficient, as the experienced Marcus knew, to  remove a murmured conversation from the sharpest eavesdropper.    Jean, who was carrying on a three-cornered conversation with her father  and Mrs. Cole-Mortimer, did not stir, until she saw, by the light of a  shaded lamp in the roof, the dark head of Mr. Marcus Stepney droop more  confidently towards his companion. Then she rose and strolled across.    Marcus did not curse her because he did not express his inmost thoughts  aloud.    He gave her his chair and pulled another forward.    \"Does Miss Briggerland know?\" asked Lydia.    \"No,\" said Mr. Stepney pleasantly.    \"May I tell her?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"Mr. Stepney has been telling me about a wonderful racing coup to be  made to-morrow. Isn't it rather thrilling, Jean? He says it will be  quite possible for me to make five million francs without any risk at  all.\"    \"Except the risk of a million, I suppose,\" smiled Jean. \"Well, are you  going to do it?\" Lydia shook her head.    \"I haven't a million francs in France, for one thing,\" she said, \"and I  wouldn't risk it if I had.\"    And Jean smiled again at the discomfiture which Mr. Marcus Stepney  strove manfully to hide.    Later she took his arm and led him into the garden.    \"Marcus,\" she said when they were out of range of the house, \"I think  you are several kinds of a fool.\"    \"Why?\" asked the other, who was not in the best humour.    \"It was so crude,\" she said scornfully, \"so cheap and  confidence-trickish. A miserable million francs--twenty thousand pounds.  Apart from the fact that your name would be mud in London if it were  known that you had robbed a girl----\"    \"There's no question of robbery,\" he said hotly, \"I tell you Valdau is a  certainty for the Prix.\"    \"It would not be a certainty if her money were on,\" said Jean dryly. \"It  would finish an artistic second and you would be full of apologies, and  poor Lydia would be a million francs to the bad. No, Marcus, that is  cheap.\"    \"I'm nearly broke,\" he said shortly.    He made no disguise of his profession, nor of his nefarious plan.    Between the two there was a queer kind of camaraderie. Though he may not  have been privy to the more tremendous of her crimes, yet he seemed to  accept her as one of those who lived on the frontiers of illegality.    \"I was thinking about you, as you sat there telling her the story,\" said  Jean thoughtfully. \"Marcus, why don't you marry her?\"    He stopped in his stride and looked down at the girl.    \"Marry her, Jean; are you mad? She wouldn't marry me.\"    \"Why not?\" she asked. \"Of course she'd marry you, you silly fool, if you  went the right way about it.\"    He was silent.    \"She is worth six hundred thousand pounds, and I happen to know that she  has nearly two hundred thousand pounds in cash on deposit at the bank,\"  said Jean.    \"Why do you want me to marry her?\" he asked significantly. \"Is there a  rake-off for you?\"    \"A big rake-off,\" she said. \"The two hundred thousand on deposit should  be easily get-at-able, Marcus, and she'd even give you more----\"    \"Why?\" he asked.    \"To agree to a separation,\" she said coolly. \"I know you. No woman could  live very long with you and preserve her reason.\"    He chuckled.    \"And I'm to hand it all over to you?\"    \"Oh no,\" she corrected. \"I'm not greedy. It is my experience that the  greedy people get into bad trouble. The man or woman who 'wants it all'  usually gets the dressing-case the 'all' was kept in. No, I'd like to  take a half.\"    He sat down on a garden seat and she followed his example.    \"What is there to be?\" he asked. \"An agreement between you and me?  Something signed and sealed and delivered, eh?\"    Her sad eyes caught his and held them.    \"I trust you, Marcus,\" she said softly. \"If I help you in this--and I  will if you will do all that I tell you to do--I will trust you to give  me my share.\"    Mr. Marcus Stepney fingered his collar a little importantly.    \"I've never let a pal down in my life,\" he said with a cough. \"I'm as  straight as they make 'em, to people who play the game with me.\"    \"And you are wise, so far as I am concerned,\" said the gentle Jean. \"For  if you double-crossed me, I should hand the police the name and address  of your other wife who is still living.\"    His jaw dropped.    \"Wha--what?\" he stammered.    \"Let us join the ladies,\" mocked Jean, as she rose and put her arm in  his.    It pleased her immensely to feel this big man trembling.          Chapter XXI      It seemed to Lydia that she had been abroad for years, though in reality  she had been three days in Cap Martin, when Mr. Marcus Stepney became a  regular caller.    Even the most objectionable people improve on acquaintance, and give the  lie to first impressions.    Mr. Stepney never bored her. He had an inexhaustible store of anecdotes  and reminiscences, none of which was in the slightest degree offensive.  He was something of a sportsman, too, and he called by arrangement the  next morning, after his introduction to the Cap Martin household, and  conducting her to a sheltered cove, containing two bathing huts, he  introduced her to the exhilarating Mediterranean.    Sea bathing is not permitted in Monte Carlo until May, and the water was  much colder than Lydia had expected. They swam out to a floating  platform when Mr. Briggerland and Jean put in an appearance. Jean had  come straight from the house in her bathing-gown, over which she wore a  light wrap. Lydia watched her with amazement, for the girl was an  expert swimmer. She could dive from almost any height and could remain  under"]]]
