Can the consciousness then continue to exist? On  this last point it seems that doubt is not possible, and we must  answer in the negative. A consciousness without an object, an empty  consciousness, in consequence, cannot be conceived; it would be a  zero--a pure nothingness; it could not manifest itself. We might  admit, in strictness, that such a consciousness might exist virtually  as a power which is not exercised, a reserve, a potentiality, or a  possibility of being; but we cannot comprehend that this power can  realise or actualize itself. There is therefore no actual  consciousness without an object.    The problem we have just raised, that of the separability of the  elements which compose an act of consciousness, is continued by  another problem--that of unconsciousness. It is almost the same  problem, for to ask one's self what becomes of a known thing when we  separate from it the consciousness which at first accompanied it, is  to ask one's self in what an unconscious phenomenon consists.    We have, till now, considered the two principal forms of  unconsciousness--that in nature and that in thought. The first named  unconsciousness does not generally bear that name, but is rather  discussed under the name of idealism and realism. Whatever be their  names, these two kinds of unconsciousness are conceivable, and the  more so that they both belong to physical nature.    If we allow ourselves to be guided by the concept of separability, we  shall now find that we have exhausted the whole series of possible  problems, for we have examined all the possible separations between  the consciousness and its objects; but if we use another concept, that  of unconsciousness, we can go further and propound a new problem: can  the consciousness become unconscious? But it is proper first to make a  few distinctions. It is the role of metaphysics to make  distinctions.[31]    Unconsciousness presupposes a death of the consciousness; but this  death has its degrees, and before complete extinction we may conceive  it to undergo many attenuations. There is, first, the diminution of  consciousness.    Consciousness is a magnitude capable of increase and decrease, like  sensation itself. According to the individual, consciousness may have  a very large or a very small field, and may embrace at the same time a  variable number of objects. I can pay attention to several things at  the same time, but when I am tired it becomes more difficult to me. I  lose in extension, or, as is still said, the field of consciousness is  restricted. It may also lose not only in extent of surface, but in  depth. We have all of us observed in our own selves moments of obscure  consciousness when we understand dimly, and moments of luminous  consciousness which carry one almost to the very bottom of things. It  is difficult to consider those in the wrong who admit, with Leibnitz,  the existence of small states of consciousness. The lessening of the  consciousness is already our means of understanding the unconscious;  unconsciousness is the limit of this reduction.[32]    This singular fact has also been noticed, that, in the same individual  there may co-exist several kinds of consciousness which do not enter  into communication with each other and which are not acquainted with  each other. There is a principal consciousness which speaks, and, in  addition, accessory kinds of consciousness which do not speak, but  reveal their existence by the use of other modes of expression, of  which the most frequent is writing.    This doubling or fractionation of the consciousness and personality  have often been described in the case of hysterical subjects. They  sometimes occur quite spontaneously, but mostly they require a little  suggestion and cultivation. In any case, that they are produced in one  way or other proves that they are possible, and, for the theory, this  possibility is essential. Facts of this kind do not lead to a theory  of the unconscious, but they enable us to understand how certain  phenomena, unconscious in appearance, are conscious to themselves,  because they belong to states of consciousness which have been  separated from each other.    A third thesis, more difficult of comprehension than the other two,  supposes that the consciousness may be preserved in an unconscious  form. This is difficult to admit, because unconsciousness is the  negation of consciousness. It is like saying that light can be  preserved when darkness is produced, or that an object still exists  when, by the hypothesis, it has been radically destroyed. This idea  conveys no intelligible meaning, and there is no need to dwell on it.    We have not yet exhausted all the concepts whereby we may get to  unconsciousness. Here is another, the last I shall quote, without,  however, claiming that it is the last which exists. We might call it  the physiological concept, for it is the one which the physiologists  employ for choice. It is based upon the observation of the phenomena  which are produced in the nervous system during our acts of  consciousness; these phenomena precede consciousness as a rule, and  condition it. According to a convenient figure which has been long in  use, the relations of the physiological phenomenon to the  consciousness are represented as follows: the physiological phenomenon  consists in an excitement which, at one time, follows a direct and  short route from the door by which it enters the nervous system to the  door by which it makes its exit. In this case, it works like a simple  mechanical phenomenon; but sometimes it makes a longer journey, and  takes a circuitous road by which it passes into the higher nerve  centres, and it is at the moment when it takes this circuitous road  that the phenomenon of consciousness is produced. The use of this  figure does not prejudge any important question.    Going further, many contemporary authors do not content themselves  with the proposition that the consciousness is conditioned by the  nervous phenomenon, but suggest also that it is continually  accompanied by it. Every psychical fact of perception, of emotion, or  of idea should have, it is supposed, a physiological basis. It would  therefore be, taken in its entirety, psycho-physiological. This is  called the parallelist theory.    We cannot discuss this here, as we shall meet with it again in the  third part of this book. It has the advantage of leading to a very  simple definition of unconsciousness. The unconscious is that which is  purely physiological. We represent to ourselves the mechanical part of  the total phenomenon continuing to produce itself, in the absence of  the consciousness, as if this last continued to follow and illuminate  it.    Such are the principal conceptions that may be formed of the  unconscious. They are probably not the only ones, and our list is not  exhaustive.    After having indicated what the unconscious is, we will terminate by  pointing out what it is not and what it cannot be.    We think, or at least we have impliedly supposed in the preceding  definitions, that the unconscious is only something unknown, which may  have been known, or which might become known under certain conditions,  and which only differs from the known by the one characteristic of not  being actually known. If this notion be correct, one has really not  the right to arm this unconsciousness with formidable powers. It has  the power of the reality to which it corresponds, but its character  of unconsciousness adds nothing to this. It is the same with it as  with the science of the future. No scholar will hesitate to admit that  that science will be deeper and more refined than that already formed.  But it is not from the fact that it is unknown that it will deserve  its superiority: it is from the phenomena that it will embrace. To  give to that which is unconscious, as we here understand it, an  overwhelming superiority over the conscious as such, we must admit  that the consciousness is not only a useless luxury, but the  dethronement of the forces that it accompanies.    In the next place, I decline to admit that the consciousness itself  can become unconscious, and yet continue in some way under an  unconscious form. This would be, in my opinion, bringing together two  conceptions which contradict each other, and thus denying after having  affirmed. From the moment that the consciousness dies, there remains  nothing of it, unless it be the conditions of its appearance,  conditions which are distinct from itself. Between two moments of  consciousness separated by time or by a state of unconsciousness,  there does not and cannot exist any link. I feel incapable of  imagining of what this link could be composed, unless it were  material--that is to say, unless it were supplied from the class of  objects. I have already said that the substantialist thesis  endeavours to establish a continuity between one consciousness and  another separated by time, by supposing a something durable, of which  the consciousness would be a property of intermittent manifestation.  They would thus explain the interruptions of consciousness as the  interruptions in the light of a lamp. When the light is extinguished,  the lamp remains in darkness, but is still capable of being lighted.  Let us discard this metaphor, which may lead to illusion. The concept  of consciousness can furnish no link and no mental state which remains  when the consciousness is not made real; if this link exists, it is in  the permanence of the material objects and of the nervous organism  which allows the return of analogous conditions of matter.

How many gallons will it hold? A. 342 gallons. 2. Will it be  better to have it painted inside? A. Yes. 3. How many years will the  tank wear under favorable circumstances, using well water? A.  Depends upon the care taken of it.    (9) W. H. C. asks: Is there any way of deadening the noise of machinery  overhead from the engine room below? The noise comes from machinery in  the weave room of an alpaca mill. A. This is generally accomplished by  setting the legs of the machines on thick pieces of India-rubber or  other non-conductor of sound.    (10) G. H. asks: How can I mount photos on glass and color them? A.  Take a strongly printed photograph on paper, and saturate it from the  back with a rag dipped in castor oil. Carefully rub off all excess from  the surface after obtaining thorough transparency. Take a piece of glass  an inch larger all round than the print, pour upon it dilute gelatin,  and then \"squeegee\" the print and glass together. Allow it to dry, and  then work in artists' oil colors from the back until you get the proper  effect from the front. Both landscapes and portraits can be effectively  colored by the above method without any great skill being required.    (11) C. W. S. asks: 1. Is there any practical and effective method known  for cutting screws by connecting the slide rest with the mandrel of the  lathe by gears or otherwise? A. This can be done in this way: attach a  spur wheel to the back of the face plate. Mount a similar wheel on a  short hollow shaft, and support the shaft by an arm bolted to the lathe  bed so that the two spur wheels will mesh together. Fit right and left  hand leading screws to the hollow shaft of the second spur wheel, and  drill a hole through them as well as through the hollow shaft to receive  the fastening pin. Now remove the longitudinal feed screw of the slide  rest and attach to one side of the carriage an adjustable socket for  receiving nuts filled to the leading screws. The number of leading  screws required will depend of course on the variety of threads it is  desired to cut unless a change of gear is provided. 2. A writer in a  foreign journal claims to make slides, or V-shaped pieces for slide  rests, eccentric chucks, etc., on his lathe. Is any such process known  here, or any process within the capabilities of an amateur mechanic by  which the planing machine can be dispensed with? A. For small work held  between the lathe centers a milling device fitted to the slide rest in  place of the tool post will answer an excellent purpose. This device  consists of a mandrel carrying at one end the cutter and at the other  end a large pulley. This mandrel is journaled in a hinged frame  supported by a block replacing the tool post, and is adjusted as to  height by a screw passing through an arm projecting from the supporting  block. The direction of the belt is adapted to this device by means of  pulleys.    (12) J. E. B. asks: 1. What is the best turbine water wheel now in use?  A. There are several wheels in market that seem equally good. You should  examine all of them and decide from your own observation which is best.  2. What is the rule for finding the horse power of water acting through  a turbine wheel which utilizes 80 per cent of the water? A. Finding the  weight of water falling over the dam and its velocity in feet per  minute, multiply the weight in pounds by the velocity, and the result is  foot pounds, divided by 33,000, the quotient is theoretical horse power;  if your wheel gives out 80 per cent. then 80 per cent of that result is  the horse power of the wheel. 3. How can I calculate the capacity of a  belt? A. You will find an exhaustive article on the subject of belts on  pp. 101, 102, Vol. 42, Scientific American, which contains the  information you desire. 4. What machine now in use is the best, all  things considered, for the manufacture of ground wood pulp? Where are  they manufactured? A. This information can probably be obtained by  inserting an advertisement in the Business and Personal column of this  paper.    (13) C. A. R writes: Wishing to renew my Leclanche batteries, which were  giving out, I bought some new empty porous cells. Please give the  following information: 1. Can I use the carbon plates of the old  elements over again? If so, do they need to undergo any washing or  soaking; or are they as good as ever? A. Yes. Soak them for a few hours  in warm water. 2. Is there anything I must add to the granular manganese  with which I fill the cells, in order to obtain maximum power and  endurance? Some makers add pulverized or even coarsely broken carbon. Is  it an advantage? A. It is an advantage to add granulated carbon to the  manganese. Use equal parts of each. 3. What is the exact composition of  the curdy mass which forms around and especially underneath the zincs of  newly mounted and old gravity batteries. Is this substance formed  naturally, or is it the result of using poor zinc or sulphate of copper?  A. It is copper, and should be removed, for it weakens the battery. It  is the result of placing the zinc in the sulphate of copper solution. 4.  Is there any real advantage in amalgamating the zincs of the above  batteries? A. No. 5. Is there a speedy way of cleaning them when coated  with this substance? A. They can be cleaned by scraping. 6. At certain  occasions my electric bells began ringing without anybody apparently  closing the circuit. I often notice that if I unjoin the batteries and  let them remain thus for a few hours, on reconnecting them the bells  would work all right for a week, sometimes a fortnight, when the same  trouble would again occur. Can you in any way explain this phenomenon?  The batteries are not placed in a very dry part of the house, but the  wires, which run pretty closely together, are nearly all exposed, so  that I can control the slightest corrosion or uncovering of the  conductors. A. There must be some accidental closing of the circuit. We  could not explain the action of your line without seeing it.    (14) J. E. E. asks: What is the number of layers of wire, and the size  used for the primary of the induction coil in the Blake transmitter, and  as near as you can the amount used for secondary? A. For primary, use  three layers of No. 20 magnet wire, and for the secondary use twelve or  fourteen layers of No. 36 silk covered copper wire. The resistance of  the secondary wire should be from 100 to 150 ohms.    (15) J. M. I. asks how to make a barometer by coloring ribbon, so that  they will change color, indicating weather changes. A. Use a moderately  strong solution of chloride of cobalt in water.    (16) O. C. H. writes: In reply to R. A. R., question 22, in Scientific  American, December 4, I will say that some months ago I was engaged in  running a saw mill, lathe, and shingle factory; was troubled with two  hot boxes, and frequently had to stop and apply ice. Seeing in the  Scientific American a reference to the use of plumbago, I sent for some,  and after three or four applications was troubled no more with hot  boxes.    (17) F. W. asks: What is the best way for return pipe to go into the  boiler from radiators--steam at 60 lb. per square inch, fall 15 feet? A.  If your job is properly piped you can bring your return pipe in at any  convenient place in your boiler below the water line. If you go into the  feed pipe, have your connection inside all other valves.    (18) L. T. G. writes: 1. I have four cells of carbon battery; the  solutions are bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid. Also three cells  of the Smee; sulphuric acid one part, to ten of water; and the four  cells of the carbon battery are not sufficient to run my small  electro-magnetic engine, for more than two or three minutes. I wish to  know if it would be injurious to either one of the batteries if I should  unite them both in one circuit, to run the engine, for about one or two  hours at a time. A. The batteries will not be injured, but they will not  work well together. Better increase the number of carbon elements. 2.  Will either of the above batteries freeze in winter, or will cold  weather affect their working? A. They will not freeze, but it is better  to keep them at a temperature above freezing 3. Is it always best to use  the largest wire in connecting batteries with any instrument, say, above  No. 11 or No. 12 wire, as the larger the wire the less the resistance,  thereby getting nearly the full power of the battery? A. Yes. 4. What  purposes are quantity and intensity electricity best suited for  respectively? A. Batteries are arranged for quantity or intensity  according to the work to be done. The maximum effect is obtained when  the battery elements are combined, so that the total resistance in the  elements is equal to the resistance of the rest of the circuit.    (19) J. H. asks: Which would be the strongest, two 2-inch by 4-inch  joists nailed together, or one 4-inch by 4-inch joist? A. One 4-inch by  4-inch.    (20) J. K. B. writes: I suppose every experimenter who uses a carbon  battery has been troubled by the uncertainty of the carbon connection.  The makers of the Grenet battery seem to have solved the problem. Can  you tell us through your correspondence column what solder they use, and  how they make it stick? A. The carbon is coated with copper by  electro-deposition; this coating is readily soldered to the carbon  support with common soft solder.    (21) M. D. M. asks: 1. Is there a difference in a steam engine between  the boiler pressure and the pressure on the piston when the piston is  moving 460 feet per minute? A. Yes. 2. About what difference? A. From 2  to 8 lb., depending upon size and length of steam pipe. 3. Does the  difference between them vary with a difference in the motion of the  piston in the same engine? A. Not appreciably within usual limits of  speed.    (22) F. writes: We have just closed up our steam stone works for this  "]]]
