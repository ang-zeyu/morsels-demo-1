Draghignazzo, also, he  wished to give him a clutch down at his legs, whereat their  decurion turned round about with evil look.    When they were a little appeased, my Leader, without delay, asked  him who still was gazing at his wound, \"Who was he from whom thou  sayest thou madest in parting to come to shore?\" And he replied,  \"It was Brother Gomita, he of Gallura,[1] vessel of all fraud,  who held the enemies of his lord in hand, and dealt so with them  that they all praise him for it. Money he took, and let them  smoothly off, so he says; and in other offices besides he was no  little barrator, but sovereign. With him frequents Don Michael  Zanche of Logodoro,[2] and in talking of Sardinia their tongues  feel not weary. O me! see ye that other who is grinning: I would  say more, but I fear lest he is making ready to scratch my itch.\"  And the grand provost, turning to Farfarello, who was rolling his  eyes as if to strike, said, \"Get thee away, wicked bird!\"    [1] Gallura, one of the four divisions of Sardinia, called  judicatures, made by the Pisans, after their conquest of the  island. The lord of Gomita was the gentle Judge Nino, whom Dante  meets in Purgatory. Gomita was hung for his frauds.    [2] Logodoro was another of the judicatures of Sardinia. Don  Michael Zanche was a noted man, but of his special sins little or  nothing has been recorded by the chroniclers.      \"If you wish to see or to hear Tuscans or Lombards,\" thereon  began again the frightened one, \"I will make them come; but let  the Malebranche stand a little withdrawn, so that they may not be  afraid of their vengeance, and I, sitting in this very place, for  one that I am, will make seven of them come, when I shall whistle  as is our wont to do whenever one of us comes out.\" Cagnazzo at  this speech raised his muzzle, shaking his head, and said, \"Hear  the knavery he has devised for throwing himself under!\" Whereon  he who had snares in great plenty answered, \"Too knavish am I,  when I procure for mine own companions greater sorrow.\" Alichino  held not in, and, in opposition to the others, said to him, \"If  thou dive, I will not come behind thee at a gallop, but I will  beat my wings above the pitch; let the ridge be left, and be the  bank a shield, to see if thou alone availest more than we.\"    O thou that readest! thou shalt hear new sport. Each turned his  eyes to the other side, he first who had been most averse to  doing it. The Navarrese chose well his time, planted his feet  firmly on the ground, and in an instant leaped, and from their  purpose freed himself. At this, each of them was pricked with  shame, but he most who was the cause of the loss; wherefore he  started and cried out, \"Thou art caught.\" But little it availed,  for wings could not outstrip fear. The one went under, and the  other, flying, turned his breast upward. Not otherwise the wild  duck on a sudden dives when the falcon comes close, and he  returns up vexed and baffled. Calcabrina, enraged at the flout,  kept flying behind him, desirous that the sinner should escape,  that he might have a scuffle; and when the barrator had  disappeared he turned his talons upon his companion, and grappled  with him above the ditch. But the other was indeed a sparrowhawk  full grown to gripe him well, and both fell into the midst of the  boiling pool. The heat was a sudden ungrappler, but nevertheless  there was no rising from it, they had their wings so glued.  Barbariccia, grieving with the rest of his troop, made four of  them fly to the other side with all their forks, and very  quickly, this side and that, they descended to their post. They  stretched out their hooks toward the belimed ones, who were  already baked within the crust: and we left them thus embroiled.        CANTO XXIII. Eighth Circle. Escape from the fifth pit.--The sixth  pit: hypocrites, in cloaks of gilded lead.--Jovial Friars.  --Caiaphas.--Annas.--Frate Catalano.    Silent, alone, and without company, we went on, one before, the  other behind, as the Minor friars go along the way. My thought  was turned by the present brawl upon the fable of Aesop, in which  he tells of the frog and the mole; for NOW and THIS INSTANT are  not more alike than the one is to the other, if beginning and end  are rightly coupled by the attentive mind.[1] And as one thought  bursts out from another, so from that then sprang another which  made my first fear double. I reflected in this wise: These  through us have been flouted, and with such harm and mock as I  believe must vex them greatly; if anger to ill-will be added,  they will come after us more merciless than the dog upon the  leveret which he snaps.    [1] \"Sed dices forsan, lector,\" says Benvenuto da Imola, \"nescio  per me videre quomodo istae duae fictiones habeant inter se  tantam convenientam. Ad quod respondeo, quod passus vere est  fortis.\" The point seems to be that, the frog having deceitfully  brought the mole to trouble and death, the mole declares, \"me  vindicabit major,\" and the eagle swoops down and devours the frog  as well as the dead mole. The comparison is not very close except  in the matter of anticipated vengeance.      Already I was feeling my hair all bristling with fear, and was  backwards intent, when I said, \"Master, if thou concealest not  thyself and me speedily, I am afraid of the Malebranche; we have  them already behind us, and I so imagine them that I already feel  them.\" And he, \"If I were of leaded glass,[1] I should not draw  thine outward image more quickly to me than thine inward I  receive. Even now came thy thoughts among mine, with similar  action and with similar look, so that of both one sole design I  made. If it be that the right bank lieth so that we can descend  into the next pit, we shall escape the imagined chase.\"    [1] A mirror.      Not yet had he finished reporting this design, when I saw them  coming with spread wings, not very far off, with will to take us.  My Leader on a sudden took me, as a mother who is wakened by the  noise, and near her sees the kindled flames, who takes her son  and flies, and, having more care of him than of herself, stays  not so long as only to put on a shift. And down from the ridge of  the hard bank, supine he gave himself to the sloping rock that  closes one of the sides of the next pit. Never ran water so  swiftly through a duct, to turn the wheel of a land-mill, when it  approaches near est to the paddles, as my Master over that  border, bearing me along upon his breast, as his own son, and not  as his companion. Hardly had his feet reached the bed of the  depth below, when they were on the ridge right over us; but here  there was no fear, for the high Providence that willed to set  them as ministers of the fifth ditch deprived them all of power  of departing thence.    There below we found a painted people who were going around with  very slow steps, weeping, and in their semblance weary and  vanquished. They had cloaks, with hoods lowered before their  eyes, made of the same cut as those of the monks in Cluny.  Outwardly they are gilded, so that it dazzles, but within all  lead, and so heavy that Frederick put them on of straw.[1] Oh  mantle wearisome for eternity!    [1] The leaden cloaks which the Emperor Frederick II. caused to  be put on criminals, who were then burned to death, were light as  straw in comparison with these.      We turned, still ever to the left hand, along with them, intent  on their sad plaint. But because of the weight that tired folk  came so slowly that we had fresh company at every movement of the  haunch. Wherefore I to my Leader, \"See that thou find some one  who may be known by deed or name, and so in going move thy eyes  around.\" And one who understood the Tuscan speech cried out  behind us, \"Stay your feet, ye who run thus through the dusky  air; perchance thou shalt have from me that which thou askest.\"  Whereon the Leader turned and said, \"Await, and then according to  his pace proceed.\" I stopped, and saw two show, by their look,  great haste of mind to be with me, but their load delayed them,  and the narrow way.    When they had come up, somewhile, with eye askance,[1] they gazed  at me without a word; then they turned to each other, and said  one to the other, \"This one seems alive by the action of his  throat; and if they are dead, by what privilege do they go  uncovered by the heavy stole?\" Then they said to me, \"O Tuscan,  who to the college of the wretched hypocrites art come, disdain  not to tell who thou art.\" And I to them, \"I was born and grew up  on the fair river of Arno, at the great town, and I am in the  body that I have always had. But ye, who are ye, in whom such woe  distills, as I see, down your cheeks? and what punishment is on  you that so sparkles?\" And one of them replied to me, \"The orange  hoods are of lead so thick that the weights thus make their  scales to creak. Jovial Friars[2] were we, and Bolognese; I  Catalano, and he Loderingo named, and together taken by thy city,  as one man alone is wont to be taken, in order to preserve its  peace; and we were such as still is apparent round about the  Gardingo.\" I began, \"O Friars, your evil\"--but more I said not,  for there struck mine eyes one crucified with three stakes on the  ground. When me he saw he writhed all over, blowing into his  beard with sighs: and the Friar Catalano, who observed it, said  to me, \"That transfixed one, whom thou lookest at, counseled the  Pharisees that it was expedient to put one man to torture for the  people. Crosswise and naked is he on the path, as thou seest, and  he first must feel how much whoever passes weighs. And in such  fashion his father-in-law is stretched in this ditch, and the  others of that Council which for the Jews was seed of ill.\"[3]  Then I saw Virgil marvelling over him that was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#18)"],[1,"things which the Evangelists recount of Him, did He do any in  very truth, but only in appearance; and hence it would also follow  that the real salvation of man has not taken place; since the effect  must be proportionate to the cause. The third reason is taken from  the dignity of the Person assuming, Whom it did not become to have  anything fictitious in His work, since He is the Truth. Hence our  Lord Himself deigned to refute this error (Luke 24:37, 39), when the  disciples, \"troubled and frighted, supposed that they saw a spirit,\"  and not a true body; wherefore He offered Himself to their touch,  saying: \"Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as  you see Me to have.\"    Reply Obj. 1: This likeness indicates the truth of the human nature  in Christ--just as all that truly exist in human nature are said to  be like in species--and not a mere imaginary likeness. In proof of  this the Apostle subjoins (Phil. 2:8) that He became \"obedient unto  death, even to the death of the cross\"; which would have been  impossible, had it been only an imaginary likeness.    Reply Obj. 2: By assuming a true body the dignity of the Son of God  is nowise lessened. Hence Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad  Petrum ii): \"He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, that  He might become a servant; yet did He not lose the fulness of the  form of God.\" For the Son of God assumed a true body, not so as to  become the form of a body, which is repugnant to the Divine  simplicity and purity--for this would be to assume a body to the  unity of the nature, which is impossible, as is plain from what has  been stated above (Q. 2, A. 1): but, the natures remaining distinct,  He assumed a body to the unity of Person.    Reply Obj. 3: The figure ought to correspond to the reality as  regards the likeness and not as regards the truth of the thing. For  if they were alike in all points, it would no longer be a likeness  but the reality itself, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 26).  Hence it was more fitting that the apparitions of the old Testament  should be in appearance only, being figures; and that the apparition  of the Son of God in the world should be in a real body, being the  thing prefigured by these figures. Hence the Apostle says (Col.  2:17): \"Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is  Christ's.\"  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [III, Q. 5, Art. 2]    Whether the Son of God Ought to Have Assumed a Carnal or Earthly Body?    Objection 1: It would seem that Christ had not a carnal or earthly,  but a heavenly body. For the Apostle says (1 Cor. 15:41): \"The first  man was of the earth, earthy; the second man from heaven, heavenly.\"  But the first man, i.e. Adam, was of the earth as regards his body,  as is plain from Gen. 1. Therefore the second man, i.e. Christ, was  of heaven as regards the body.    Obj. 2: Further, it is said (1 Cor. 15:50): \"Flesh and blood shall  not [Vulg.: 'cannot'] possess the kingdom of God.\" But the kingdom of  God is in Christ chiefly. Therefore there is no flesh or blood in  Him, but rather a heavenly body.    Obj. 3: Further, whatever is best is to be attributed to God. But of  all bodies a heavenly body is the best. Therefore it behooved Christ  to assume such a body.    _On the contrary,_ our Lord says (Luke 24:39): \"A spirit hath not  flesh and bones, as you see Me to have.\" Now flesh and bones are not  of the matter of heavenly bodies, but are composed of the inferior  elements. Therefore the body of Christ was not a heavenly, but a  carnal and earthly body.    _I answer that,_ By the reasons which proved that the body of Christ  was not an imaginary one, it may also be shown that it was not a  heavenly body. First, because even as the truth of the human nature  of Christ would not have been maintained had His body been an  imaginary one, such as Manes supposed, so likewise it would not have  been maintained if we supposed, as did Valentine, that it was a  heavenly body. For since the form of man is a natural thing, it  requires determinate matter, to wit, flesh and bones, which must be  placed in the definition of man, as is plain from the Philosopher  (Metaph. vii, 39). Secondly, because this would lessen the truth of  such things as Christ did in the body. For since a heavenly body is  impassible and incorruptible, as is proved De Coel. i, 20, if the Son  of God had assumed a heavenly body, He would not have truly hungered  or thirsted, nor would he have undergone His passion and death.  Thirdly, this would have detracted from God's truthfulness. For since  the Son of God showed Himself to men, as if He had a carnal and  earthly body, the manifestation would have been false, had He had a  heavenly body. Hence (De Eccles. Dogm. ii) it is said: \"The Son of  God was born, taking flesh of the Virgin's body, and not bringing it  with Him from heaven.\"    Reply Obj. 1: Christ is said in two ways to have come down from  heaven. First, as regards His Divine Nature; not indeed that the  Divine Nature ceased to be in heaven, but inasmuch as He began to be  here below in a new way, viz. by His assumed nature, according to  John 3:13: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He that descended  from heaven, the Son of Man, Who is in heaven.\"    Secondly, as regards His body, not indeed that the very substance of  the body of Christ descended from heaven, but that His body was  formed by a heavenly power, i.e. by the Holy Ghost. Hence Augustine,  explaining the passage quoted, says (Ad Orosium [*Dial. Qq. lxv, qu.  4, work of an unknown author]): \"I call Christ a heavenly man because  He was not conceived of human seed.\" And Hilary expounds it in the  same way (De Trin. x).    Reply Obj. 2: Flesh and blood are not taken here for the substance of  flesh and blood, but for the corruption of flesh, which was not in  Christ as far as it was sinful; but as far as it was a punishment;  thus, for a time, it was in Christ, that He might carry through the  work of our redemption.    Reply Obj. 3: It pertains to the greatest glory of God to have raised  a weak and earthly body to such sublimity. Hence in the General  Council of Ephesus (P. II, Act. I) we read the saying of St.  Theophilus: \"Just as the best workmen are esteemed not merely for  displaying their skill in precious materials, but very often because  by making use of the poorest clay and commonest earth, they show the  power of their craft; so the best of all workmen, the Word of God,  did not come down to us by taking a heavenly body of some most  precious matter, but shewed the greatness of His skill in clay.\"  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [III, Q. 5, Art. 3]    Whether the Son of God Assumed a Soul?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God did not assume a soul.  For John has said, teaching the mystery of the Incarnation (John  1:14): \"The Word was made flesh\"--no mention being made of a soul.  Now it is not said that \"the Word was made flesh\" as if changed to  flesh, but because He assumed flesh. Therefore He seems not to have  assumed a soul.    Obj. 2: Further, a soul is necessary to the body, in order to quicken  it. But this was not necessary for the body of Christ, as it would  seem, for of the Word of God it is written (Ps. 35:10): Lord, \"with  Thee is the fountain of life.\" Therefore it would seem altogether  superfluous for the soul to be there, when the Word was present. But  \"God and nature do nothing uselessly,\" as the Philosopher says (De  Coel. i, 32; ii, 56). Therefore the Word would seem not to have  assumed a soul.    Obj. 3: Further, by the union of soul and body is constituted the  common nature, which is the human species. But \"in the Lord Jesus  Christ we are not to look for a common species,\" as Damascene says  (De Fide Orth. iii, 3). Therefore He did not assume a soul.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Agone Christ. xxi): \"Let us not  hearken to such as say that only a human body was assumed by the Word  of God; and take 'the Word was made flesh' to mean that the man had  no soul nor any other part of a man, save flesh.\"    _I answer that,_ As Augustine says (De Haeres. 69, 55), it was first  of all the opinion of Arius and then of Apollinaris that the Son of  God assumed only flesh, without a soul, holding that the Word took  the place of a soul to the body. And consequently it followed that  there were not two natures in Christ, but only one; for from a soul  and body one human nature is constituted. But this opinion cannot  hold, for three reasons. First, because it is counter to the  authority of Scripture, in which our Lord makes mention of His soul,  Matt. 26:38: \"My soul is sorrowful even unto death\"; and John 10:18:  \"I have power to lay down My soul [_animam meam:_ Douay: 'My life'].\"  But to this Apollinaris replied that in these words soul is taken  metaphorically, in which way mention is made in the Old Testament of  the soul of God (Isa. 1:14): \"My soul hateth your new moons and your  solemnities.\" But, as Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 80), the  Evangelists relate how Jesus wondered, was angered, sad, and hungry.  Now these show that He had a true soul, just as that He ate, slept  and was weary shows that He had a true human body: otherwise, if  these things are a metaphor, because the like are said of God in the  Old Testament, the trustworthiness of the Gospel story is undermined.  For it is one thing that things were foretold in a figure, and  another that historical events were related in very truth by the  Evangelists. Secondly, this error lessens the utility of the  Incarnation, which is man's liberation. For Augustine [*Vigilius  Tapsensis] argues thus (Contra Felician. xiii): \"If the Son of God in  taking flesh passed over the soul, either He knew its sinlessness,  and trusted it did not need a remedy; or He considered it unsuitable  to Him, and did not bestow on it the boon of redemption; or He  reckoned it altogether"]]]
