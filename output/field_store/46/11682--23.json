Were the Balkan States satisfied with the above arrangement when the  great European war broke? To this question we have the following  answer from those concerned:    Turkey never forgave the European powers the treatment accorded to her  in the London peace conference, and proved her dissatisfaction by  entering Thrace and occupying Adrianople immediately she saw Bulgaria  engaged in the second war. But Turkey desired also the Aegean islands  occupied by Greece, and these, all but two at the entrance to the  Dardanelles, the powers allotted to Greece, not securing thereby an  increase of Turkish sympathies.    Greece was disappointed in two instances by the European powers;  first, because they did not make their decision regarding the islands  binding upon Turkey, thus creating a series of unending controversies  between the Porte and the Government of Athens, one result of which  was the wholesale expulsions and persecutions of the Greek element in  Turkey, and especially in the Vilayets of Adrianople and Smyrna. The  question of settling in a friendly way the Greco-Turkish differences  was to be discussed between the Grand Vizier, Prince Said Halim, and  the Premier of Greece, E.K. Venizelos, in a meeting of the two  statesmen in Brussels, when the great European war broke.    Bulgaria, who for a moment saw her most cherished dream of Balkan  hegemony realized and had all her fondest hopes shattered by the  second war and the Treaty of Bucharest, cannot help regarding her  neighbors as the robbers of what she considers her national patrimony,  and at the same time she does not forget that in all their proceedings  against her, Greek, Servian, Rumanian, and Montenegrin acted with the  tacit approval of the great powers.    Servia for years had struggled to get an outlet on the Adriatic, and  when, after a glorious war, she attained her goal, she found Austria  opposing her, and behind Austria the whole of the European concert.    Montenegro in the same way cannot forget the disappointment of being  cast out of Scutari after one of the most strenuous and glorious  campaigns of her history, and lastly Albania, poor and helpless,  without any support from her creators, feels all that a weak and  wretched foundling has to feel toward those responsible for its  misfortunes and miseries. In contrast with these feelings, Rumania was  the only Balkan State perfectly satisfied with the new arrangement. In  fact, Rumania, having played in the war the part of a great power,  came out of it not only with increased prestige but also with the  richest of all the Bulgarian provinces, Dobrudja, as a sort of  deserved payment for serving the ends of European diplomacy.    From this general dissatisfaction of the Balkan States with European  diplomacy and European intrigue sprang Gavrilo Prinzip and the murder  at Serajevo that plunged Europe and the world into the greatest and  most disastrous war of all time.    In fairness, however, to the Balkan States it must be said at this  juncture that war, in whatever form and character, was far from the  Balkan mind on June 28, 1914, when the Austrian Archduke and heir to  the throne, Franz Ferdinand, and his consort were assassinated by the  Servian youth Prinzip in the capital of Bosnia.    The years 1912 and 1913 had been too costly for the whole of the  Balkan Peninsula, and the necessity of a continued peace for a good  number of years was universally recognized, with the exception of  Constantinople, in Athens, Bucharest, Sofia, Belgrade, Cettinge, and  even Durazzo. To prove this we have the opinions of all the Balkan  leaders and the views expressed in the Balkan press up to Aug. 1,  1914.    A single point yet calls for a few remarks, and this covers the mutual  relations of the Balkan States just before the European war.    We have seen in what a degree the question of the ownership of the  Aegean Islands had divided the Governments of Athens and  Constantinople. In fact, if any war in the Near East were to be  feared, this was one between the two secular enemies, Greek and Turk,  and when in May, 1913, the anti-Greek agitation in the Ottoman Empire  reached its climax it was only through the tremendous influence of the  Greek Premier on Hellenic public opinion and his extreme moderation  that a new diplomatic rupture between the two countries was averted.    In anticipation of this eventuality Turkey secured two battleships of  the dreadnought type, the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro (then Sultan Osman  I. and afterward H.M.S. Erin, England having taken over the ship on  Aug. 5, 1914) and the Reshadieh, (likewise taken over by England and  renamed H.M.S. Agincourt,) and was preparing for war in such haste  that Greece did not hesitate to buy at the original cost price the two  old American battleships Idaho and Mississippi, (now Limnos and  Kilkis.)    This was in July, 1914, just a few weeks before the European war.  Since that time Greco-Turkish relations have been neither better nor  worse. It must be said here that these relations had their origin, not  in the obsolete London Treaty of May, 1913, but in the Treaty of  Athens, signed in December, 1913, between the two countries, and  covering in a general way the more essential points of the outstanding  questions between the two parties, excluding, however, the Aegean  Islands controversy.    After signing the Treaty of Bucharest Bulgaria turned her attention  exclusively to Turkey, and, letting bygones be bygones, concluded the  Peace Treaty of Constantinople in October, 1913, and inaugurated the  most friendly relations with her erstwhile opponent. Since that time  the report has spread that an alliance, both offensive and defensive,  had been signed by the two countries, but this has been repeatedly  denied both from Constantinople and Sofia.    The diplomatic relations between Servia and Turkey and Montenegro and  Turkey were re-established a short time before the European war, but  these countries, being now in no direct contact with Turkish  territory, their relations with the Porte are of little importance.    Between Bulgaria on one hand and Rumania, Greece, Servia, and  Montenegro on the other, the diplomatic relations have been  re-established, but gone is the old friendship, for reasons already  explained. Greece, Servia, and Montenegro are the best of friends,  and, according to unofficial and confidential reports, a defensive and  offensive alliance for the maintenance of the Balkan status quo,  exists between the three countries. Between Rumania and Greece  friendly relations exist, and for some time it was said that a  marriage was to be arranged between the Greek Crown Prince, George,  and the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of the Rumanian King, Ferdinand  I., who succeeded to the throne after the death of his uncle, King  Charles. This match, however, seems to have been abandoned, perhaps  for political reasons, and more so because Greco-Rumanian relations  have not as yet reached that firmness which only might justify such a  rapprochement of the two royal families.    Between Servia and Rumania there is some courtesy but scarcely any  friendship, and this is not surprising, especially now, when each side  is aiming to an aggrandizement (at the expense of Austria) in a way  injurious to the other. Montenegro naturally follows Servia's course,  and as for Albania, what we said previously of her applies now, with  this particular observation, that the only neighborly interest shown  her is from Italy, trying to play the game of Tripoli at the expense  of the Skipetars, while all the other European powers are busily  engaged in the great war.    In conclusion we may note that of all the Balkan States only Rumania  and, to a certain degree, Greece have any money to run their affairs.  This, however, has nothing to do with the matter of their entrance in  the war, as in that case there will be one or the other European  combination to pay the freight.    Such was the aspect of the Balkan Peninsula at the beginning of the  great European war.

The professor had just routed  his opponent, and so won through to the semi-final. He was warm but  jubilant.    I congratulated him, and left the place.    Phyllis was waiting outside. She often went round the course with him.    \"Good afternoon,\" I said. \"Have you been round with the professor?\"    \"Yes. We must have been in front of you. Father won his match.\"    \"So he was telling me. I was very glad to hear it.\"    \"Did you win, Mr. Garnet?\"    \"Yes. Pretty easily. My opponent had bad luck all through. Bunkers  seemed to have a magnetic attraction for him.\"    \"So you and father are both in the semi-final? I hope you will play  very badly.\"    \"Thank you, Miss Derrick,\" I said.    \"Yes, it does sound rude, doesn't it? But father has set his heart on  winning this year. Do you know that he has played in the final round  two years running now?\"    \"Really?\"    \"Both times he was beaten by the same man.\"    \"Who was that? Mr. Derrick plays a much better game than anybody I  have seen on these links.\"    \"It was nobody who is here now. It was a Colonel Jervis. He has not  come to Lyme Regis this year. That is why father is hopeful.\"    \"Logically,\" I said, \"he ought to be certain to win.\"    \"Yes; but, you see, you were not playing last year, Mr. Garnet.\"    \"Oh, the professor can make rings round me,\" I said.    \"What did you go round in to-day?\"    \"We were playing match play, and only did the first dozen holes; but  my average round is somewhere in the late eighties.\"    \"The best father has ever done is ninety, and that was only once. So  you see, Mr. Garnet, there's going to be another tragedy this year.\"    \"You make me feel a perfect brute. But it's more than likely, you must  remember, that I shall fail miserably if I ever do play your father in  the final. There are days when I play golf very badly.\"    Phyllis smiled. \"Do you really have your off days?\"    \"Nearly always. There are days when I slice with my driver as if it  were a bread knife.\"    \"Really?\"    \"And when I couldn't putt to hit a haystack.\"    \"Then I hope it will be on one of those days that you play father.\"    \"I hope so, too,\" I said.    \"You hope so?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But don't you want to win?\"    \"I should prefer to please you.\"    Mr. Lewis Waller could not have said it better.    \"Really, how very unselfish of you, Mr. Garnet,\" she replied with a  laugh. \"I had no idea that such chivalry existed. I thought a golfer  would sacrifice anything to win a game.\"    \"Most things.\"    \"And trample on the feelings of anybody.\"    \"Not everybody,\" I said.    At this point the professor joined us.          XV    THE ARRIVAL OF NEMESIS      Some people do not believe in presentiments. They attribute that  curious feeling that something unpleasant is going to happen to such  mundane causes as liver or a chill or the weather. For my own part, I  think there is more in the matter than the casual observer might  imagine.    I awoke three days after my meeting with the professor at the  clubhouse filled with a dull foreboding. Somehow I seemed to know that  that day was going to turn out badly for me. It may have been liver or  a chill, but it was certainly not the weather. The morning was  perfect, the most glorious of a glorious summer. There was a haze over  the valley and out to sea which suggested a warm noon, when the sun  should have begun the serious duties of the day. The birds were  singing in the trees and breakfasting on the lawn, while Edwin, seated  on one of the flower beds, watched them with the eye of a connoisseur.  Occasionally, when a sparrow hopped in his direction, he would make a  sudden spring, and the bird would fly away to the other side of the  lawn. I had never seen Edwin catch a sparrow. I believe they looked on  him as a bit of a crank, and humored him by coming within springing  distance, just to keep him amused. Dashing young cock sparrows would  show off before their particular hen sparrows, and earn a cheap  reputation for dare-deviltry by going within so many yards of Edwin's  lair and then darting away.    Bob was in his favorite place on the gravel. I took him with me down  to the Cob to watch me bathe.    \"What's the matter with me to-day, Robert, old man?\" I asked him as I  dried myself.    He blinked lazily, but contributed no suggestion.    \"It's no good looking bored,\" I went on, \"because I'm going to talk  about myself, however much it bores you. Here am I, as fit as a prize  fighter; living in the open air for I don't know how long; eating  good, plain food; bathing every morning--sea bathing, mind you; and  yet what's the result? I feel beastly.\"    Bob yawned and gave a little whine.    \"Yes,\" I said, \"I know I'm in love. But that can't be it, because I  was in love just as much a week ago, and I felt all right then. But  isn't she an angel, Bob? Eh? Isn't she? But how about Tom Chase? Don't  you think he's a dangerous man? He calls her by her Christian name,  you know, and behaves generally as if she belonged to him. And then  he sees her every day, while I have to trust to meeting her at odd  times, and then I generally feel like such a fool I can't think of  anything to talk about except golf and the weather. He probably sings  duets with her after dinner. And you know what comes of duets after  dinner.\"    Here Bob, who had been trying for some time to find a decent excuse  for getting away, pretended to see something of importance at the  other end of the Cob, and trotted off to investigate it, leaving me to  finish dressing by myself.    \"Of course,\" I said to myself, \"it may be merely hunger. I may be all  right after breakfast, but at present I seem to be working up for a  really fine fit of the blues.\"    I whistled for Bob and started for home. On the beach I saw the  professor some little distance away and waved my towel in a friendly  manner. He made no reply.    Of course it was possible that he had not seen me, but for some reason  his attitude struck me as ominous. As far as I could see, he was  looking straight at me, and he was not a shortsighted man. I could  think of no reason why he should cut me. We had met on the links on  the previous morning, and he had been friendliness itself. He had  called me \"me dear boy,\" supplied me with ginger beer at the  clubhouse, and generally behaved as if he had been David and I  Jonathan. Yet in certain moods we are inclined to make mountains out  of mole-hills, and I went on my way, puzzled and uneasy, with a  distinct impression that I had received the cut direct.    I felt hurt. What had I done that Providence should make things so  unpleasant for me? It would be a little hard, as Ukridge would have  said, if, after all my trouble, the professor had discovered some  fresh crow to pluck with me. Perhaps Ukridge had been irritating him  again. I wished he would not identify me so completely with Ukridge. I  could not be expected to control the man. Then I reflected that they  could hardly have met in the few hours between my parting from the  professor at the clubhouse and my meeting with him on the beach.  Ukridge rarely left the farm. When he was not working among the fowls,  he was lying on his back in the paddock, resting his massive mind.    I came to the conclusion that, after all, the professor had not seen  me.    \"I'm an idiot, Bob,\" I said, as we turned in at the farm gate, \"and I  let my imagination run away with me.\"    Bob wagged his tail in approval of the sentiment.    Breakfast was ready when I got in. There was a cold chicken on the  sideboard, deviled chicken on the table, and a trio of boiled eggs,  and a dish of scrambled eggs. I helped myself to the latter and sat  down.    Ukridge was sorting the letters.    \"Morning, Garny,\" he said. \"One for you, Millie.\"    \"It's from Aunt Elizabeth,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, looking at the  envelope.    \"Wish she'd inclose a check. She could spare it.\"    \"I think she would, dear, if she knew how much it was needed. But I  don't like to ask her. She's so curious and says such horrid things.\"    \"She does,\" said Ukridge gloomily. He probably spoke from experience.  \"Two for you, Sebastian. All the rest for me. Eighteen of them, and  all bills.\"    He spread them out on the table like a pack of cards, and drew one at  a venture.    \"Whiteley's,\" he said. \"Getting jumpy. Are in receipt of my favor of  the 7th inst, and are at a loss to understand--all sorts of things.  Would like something on account.\"    \"Grasping of them,\" I said.    \"They seem to think I'm doing it for fun. How can I let them have  their money when there isn't any?\"    \"Sounds difficult.\"    \"Here's one from Dorchester--Smith, the man I got the gramophone from.  Wants to know when I'm going to settle up for sixteen records.\"    \"Sordid man!\"    I wanted to get on with my own correspondence, but Ukridge was one of  those men who compel one's attention when they are talking.    \"The chicken men, the dealer people, you know, want me to pay up for  the first lot of hens. Considering that they all died of roop, and  that I was going to send them back, anyhow, after I'd got them to  hatch out a few chickens, I call that cool. I can't afford to pay  heavy sums for birds which die off quicker than I can get them in. It  isn't business.\"    It was not my business, at any rate, so I switched off my attention  from Ukridge's troubles and was opening the first of my two letters  when an exclamation from Mrs. Ukridge made me look up.    She had dropped the letter she had been reading and was staring  indignantly in front of her. There were two little red spots on her  cheeks.    \"I shall never speak to Aunt Elizabeth again,\" she said.    \"What's the matter, old chap?\" inquired Ukridge affectionately,  glancing up from his pile of bills. \"Aunt Elizabeth been getting on  your nerves again? What's she been saying this time?\"    Mrs. Ukridge left the room with a"]]]
