It required two hours of the hardest  kind of work to get her off. The _President_ was not very seaworthy at  the start, and the efforts to reach deep water so injured her that it  was necessary to return to the city for repairs, but the strong contrary  wind prevented and she was driven over the bar.    Meanwhile the blockading squadron had come back and, early the next  morning, Decatur had four of them in full pursuit. He put on every  stitch of canvas, threw overboard everything that could be spared and  wet his sails, but the _President_ was so badly crippled from having run  aground that, despite all that was done, she steadily lost ground. The  _Endymion_ led the pursuers and soon drew up within range, her position  such that Decatur could not reply to the shots which began to injure his  ship and kill and wound his crew.    He formed a desperate scheme that was characteristic of him. The  _Endymion_ was so far in advance of the other pursuers that there was a  possibility of turning about and capturing her. Then, by transferring  the American crew to her, the worthless _President_ could be abandoned  and swift flight be made in the _Endymion_, which had already  demonstrated her superior speed.    The great risk in this attempt (for no one among the Americans doubted  their ability to overcome the other crew) was that before the capture  could be accomplished the other vessels would come up and Decatur be  assailed by an overwhelming force, but he did not hesitate. He explained  his plan to his men and they responded with cheers. No commander was  ever more beloved by his crew than Decatur, and they were ready to  follow him to the death, for he was always their leader and the foremost  in personal danger.    Since every minute was valuable, Decatur put about and made for the  _Endymion_ with the intention of engaging her at close quarters. But the  British vessel suspected his purpose, for she also turned, and, being  much the superior sailer, was able to hold a safe distance between the  two. It was an exasperating disappointment, but Decatur opened with a  heavy fire, hoping to disable his antagonist before the arrival of the  others.    A furious engagement followed, in which Decatur lost several of his most  valuable officers and was himself painfully wounded by flying splinters.  But the American guns were served with perfect precision and the  _Endymion_ was so broken and shattered by the fire that after two and a  half hours she was incapable of further resistance. She would have  surrendered had the time been sufficient for Decatur to enforce the  demand, but the other blockaders were hurrying up and placed the  American again in grave danger. He crowded on all sail once more, but  the scurrying clouds which gave him a chance of escaping were swept from  the sky and the bright moon revealed him so plainly to his pursuers that  they rapidly overtook the _President_. A running fight followed, but the  _President_ was overmatched in every respect. In his official report  Decatur said: \"Two fresh ships of the enemy, the 38-gun frigates  _Pomone_ and _Tenedos_, had come up. The _Pomone_ had opened fire on the  port bow, within musket shot, the other, about two cables' length  astern, taking a raking position on our quarter, and the rest, with the  exception of the _Endymion_, within gunshot. Thus situated, with about  one-fifth of my crew killed and wounded, my ship crippled and a more  than fourfold force opposed to me, without a chance of escape, I deemed  it my duty to surrender.\"    The British senior officer of the squadron to whom Decatur offered his  sword showed his appreciation of the American's gallantry and of his  chivalrous treatment of Captain Carden, when the situations were  reversed, by handing the weapon back to Decatur with the remark that he  was proud to return the sword of an officer who had defended his ship so  nobly.    Shortly after this misfortune news reached this country of the signing  of a treaty of peace, though several encounters took place on the ocean  before the tidings could reach the various ships.    Turning back to the earlier part of the war, mention must be made of  another American hero, James Lawrence, who was born in Burlington, N.J.,  in 1781 and was active in the war with Tripoli. He was commander of the  _Hornet_ when she captured the _Peacock_ in an engagement which lasted  only fifteen minutes, with the loss of one American killed and two  wounded. He was given the command of the frigate _Chesapeake_, which was  repairing in Boston harbor. The ship had gained the reputation of being  unlucky, and, having already passed through several accidents, Lawrence  assumed command with extreme reluctance.    Among the blockading vessels of the enemy outside of Boston was the  _Shannon_, commanded by Captain Philip Bowes Vere Broke. She was one of  the most efficient ships in the British navy, carried 38 guns and had a  crew of 330 men, all well disciplined and skilled in firing guns and in  fighting, while Broke himself probably had no superior as an officer.  That he was brave was proven not only by his sending a challenge to  Lawrence, inviting him to come out and fight him, but by his conduct  during the battle.    Captain Lawrence sailed out of Boston harbor before Broke's challenge  reached him. He had learned that a single frigate had presumed to  blockade the port, and, having been ordered to sail as soon as possible,  he made unwise haste in venturing to give the _Shannon_ battle, even  though one cause was the wish to leave the port before other blockaders  appeared.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN JAMES LAWRENCE.]    The crew of the _Chesapeake_ was inferior in every respect to that of  the enemy, except that it contained ten more men. The majority had been  newly enlisted and contained many foreigners, landsmen, and  objectionable sailors. They were not only unaccustomed to the  ship--though they knew of its reputation as an unlucky one--but were  unacquainted with one another and nearly all were strangers to the  officers. The best of these were absent from illness and other causes.  Worse than all, many were in a maudlin state of drunkenness when the  _Chesapeake_ started out with flags flying to engage the well-manned  _Shannon_.    On the way down the bay some of the _Chesapeake's_ crew impudently  notified Lawrence that they would not fight unless they received the  prize money earned a short time before. It was a humiliating situation  for the young commander, but he was virtually in the face of the enemy  and he issued prize checks to the malcontents. Well aware of the  character of the foe he was about to encounter, he must have looked upon  the meeting with foreboding. Maclay uses these impressive words:    [Illustration: THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE \"CHESAPEAKE\" AND THE \"SHANNON.\"]    \"The calm deliberation with which the American and English commanders  went out to seek each other's life and the earnestness with which they  urged their officers and men to steep their hands in the blood of  their fellow beings form one of the sombre pictures of naval history.  Lawrence was the youngest son of John Lawrence, Esquire,  counselor-at-law at Burlington, N.J., and was the second in command at  the celebrated capture of the _Philadelphia_ in the harbor of Tripoli.  Broke was the descendant of an ancient family which had lived in Broke  Hall, England, over three hundred and fifty years and for four hundred  years at Leighton. Both were men in the prime of manhood, Lawrence in  his thirty-second year and Broke in his thirty-seventh. Both were models  of chivalry and manly grace; both were held in the highest estimation in  their profession. Lawrence had just taken an affectionate farewell of  his two sons and an hour later was urging his men to \"_Peacock_ them!  _Peacock_ them!\" Broke a short time before had committed his wife to  God's mercy and soon afterward was urging his crew to 'Kill the men!  kill the men!' Both were men of the kindliest feelings and most tender  affections; both acknowledged the justice of the cause for which the  Americans were contending, yet with steady determination they went out  at the head of their ships' companies to take each other's life. A few  hours afterward, when Captain Broke fell on the _Chesapeake's_ decks  fainting and covered with his own blood, his lieutenants, on loosening  his clothes, found a small blue silk case suspended around his neck. It  contained a lock of his wife's hair.\"    [Illustration: DEATH OF CAPTAIN LAWRENCE.]    Lawrence, in accordance with his chivalrous nature, disdained to seek  any unfair advantage, his purpose being to engage in what is called a  fair yardarm and yardarm fight. It was toward the close of the first day  of summer, with thousands crowding the hills and points of advantage and  peering at the ships through glasses, that the battle opened by the fire  of the _Shannon_. Great damage was inflicted and much execution done by  the return broadside of the _Chesapeake_. The first fire severely  wounded Lawrence in the leg, but he refused to go below. Then the firing  became so close and rapid that half the American officers were killed or  wounded. The most frightful confusion that can be imagined followed.  When Lawrence formed his men to board after the two vessels had fouled  the bugler could not be found, whereupon Captain Broke led his own men  upon the deck of the _Chesapeake_.    It was at this critical moment that Lawrence was fatally wounded and  carried below. He kept calling out his commands while in the cockpit to  fight harder and to keep the guns going. His last words, often  repeated in his delirium, were \"_Don't give up the ship!_\" and they  formed the motto of the American navy for many years afterward.    [Illustration: THE OFFICERS OF THE \"CHESAPEAKE\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#18)"],[1,"should degenerate into  formulas. A difficult philosophical problem is better understood when  translated into the vernacular.    I.a. Psychology is inseparable from language, and early language  contains the first impressions or the oldest experience of man  respecting himself. These impressions are not accurate representations  of the truth; they are the reflections of a rudimentary age of  philosophy. The first and simplest forms of thought are rooted so deep  in human nature that they can never be got rid of; but they have been  perpetually enlarged and elevated, and the use of many words has been  transferred from the body to the mind. The spiritual and intellectual  have thus become separated from the material--there is a cleft between  them; and the heart and the conscience of man rise above the dominion  of the appetites and create a new language in which they too find  expression. As the differences of actions begin to be perceived, more  and more names are needed. This is the first analysis of the human mind;  having a general foundation in popular experience, it is moulded to  a certain extent by hierophants and philosophers. (See Introd. to  Cratylus.)    b. This primitive psychology is continually receiving additions from the  first thinkers, who in return take a colour from the popular language  of the time. The mind is regarded from new points of view, and becomes  adapted to new conditions of knowledge. It seeks to isolate itself  from matter and sense, and to assert its independence in thought. It  recognizes that it is independent of the external world. It has five  or six natural states or stages:--(1) sensation, in which it is almost  latent or quiescent: (2) feeling, or inner sense, when the mind is just  awakening: (3) memory, which is decaying sense, and from time to time,  as with a spark or flash, has the power of recollecting or reanimating  the buried past: (4) thought, in which images pass into abstract notions  or are intermingled with them: (5) action, in which the mind moves  forward, of itself, or under the impulse of want or desire or pain,  to attain or avoid some end or consequence: and (6) there is the  composition of these or the admixture or assimilation of them in various  degrees. We never see these processes of the mind, nor can we tell the  causes of them. But we know them by their results, and learn from other  men that so far as we can describe to them or they to us the workings of  the mind, their experience is the same or nearly the same with our own.    c. But the knowledge of the mind is not to any great extent derived  from the observation of the individual by himself. It is the growing  consciousness of the human race, embodied in language, acknowledged  by experience, and corrected from time to time by the influence of  literature and philosophy. A great, perhaps the most important, part of  it is to be found in early Greek thought. In the Theaetetus of Plato it  has not yet become fixed: we are still stumbling on the threshold.  In Aristotle the process is more nearly completed, and has gained  innumerable abstractions, of which many have had to be thrown away  because relative only to the controversies of the time. In the interval  between Thales and Aristotle were realized the distinctions of mind and  body, of universal and particular, of infinite and infinitesimal, of  idea and phenomenon; the class conceptions of faculties and virtues, the  antagonism of the appetites and the reason; and connected with this, at  a higher stage of development, the opposition of moral and intellectual  virtue; also the primitive conceptions of unity, being, rest, motion,  and the like. These divisions were not really scientific, but rather  based on popular experience. They were not held with the precision of  modern thinkers, but taken all together they gave a new existence to the  mind in thought, and greatly enlarged and more accurately defined man's  knowledge of himself and of the world. The majority of them have been  accepted by Christian and Western nations. Yet in modern times we have  also drifted so far away from Aristotle, that if we were to frame a  system on his lines we should be at war with ordinary language and  untrue to our own consciousness. And there have been a few both in  mediaeval times and since the Reformation who have rebelled against the  Aristotelian point of view. Of these eccentric thinkers there have been  various types, but they have all a family likeness. According to them,  there has been too much analysis and too little synthesis, too much  division of the mind into parts and too little conception of it as a  whole or in its relation to God and the laws of the universe. They have  thought that the elements of plurality and unity have not been duly  adjusted. The tendency of such writers has been to allow the personality  of man to be absorbed in the universal, or in the divine nature, and to  deny the distinction between matter and mind, or to substitute one for  the other. They have broken some of the idols of Psychology: they have  challenged the received meaning of words: they have regarded the mind  under many points of view. But though they may have shaken the old, they  have not established the new; their views of philosophy, which seem like  the echo of some voice from the East, have been alien to the mind of  Europe.    d. The Psychology which is found in common language is in some degree  verified by experience, but not in such a manner as to give it  the character of an exact science. We cannot say that words always  correspond to facts. Common language represents the mind from different  and even opposite points of view, which cannot be all of them equally  true (compare Cratylus). Yet from diversity of statements and opinions  may be obtained a nearer approach to the truth than is to be gained  from any one of them. It also tends to correct itself, because it is  gradually brought nearer to the common sense of mankind. There are  some leading categories or classifications of thought, which, though  unverified, must always remain the elements from which the science or  study of the mind proceeds. For example, we must assume ideas before we  can analyze them, and also a continuing mind to which they belong;  the resolution of it into successive moments, which would say, with  Protagoras, that the man is not the same person which he was a minute  ago, is, as Plato implies in the Theaetetus, an absurdity.    e. The growth of the mind, which may be traced in the histories of  religions and philosophies and in the thoughts of nations, is one of the  deepest and noblest modes of studying it. Here we are dealing with the  reality, with the greater and, as it may be termed, the most sacred part  of history. We study the mind of man as it begins to be inspired by a  human or divine reason, as it is modified by circumstances, as it is  distributed in nations, as it is renovated by great movements, which go  beyond the limits of nations and affect human society on a scale still  greater, as it is created or renewed by great minds, who, looking down  from above, have a wider and more comprehensive vision. This is an  ambitious study, of which most of us rather 'entertain conjecture'  than arrive at any detailed or accurate knowledge. Later arises the  reflection how these great ideas or movements of the world have  been appropriated by the multitude and found a way to the minds of  individuals. The real Psychology is that which shows how the increasing  knowledge of nature and the increasing experience of life have always  been slowly transforming the mind, how religions too have been modified  in the course of ages 'that God may be all and in all.' E pollaplasion,  eoe, to ergon e os nun zeteitai prostatteis.    f. Lastly, though we speak of the study of mind in a special sense, it  may also be said that there is no science which does not contribute to  our knowledge of it. The methods of science and their analogies are new  faculties, discovered by the few and imparted to the many. They are  to the mind, what the senses are to the body; or better, they may be  compared to instruments such as the telescope or microscope by which the  discriminating power of the senses, or to other mechanical inventions,  by which the strength and skill of the human body is so immeasurably  increased.    II. The new Psychology, whatever may be its claim to the authority of a  science, has called attention to many facts and corrected many errors,  which without it would have been unexamined. Yet it is also itself  very liable to illusion. The evidence on which it rests is vague and  indefinite. The field of consciousness is never seen by us as a whole,  but only at particular points, which are always changing. The veil  of language intercepts facts. Hence it is desirable that in making an  approach to the study we should consider at the outset what are the  kinds of error which most easily affect it, and note the differences  which separate it from other branches of knowledge.    a. First, we observe the mind by the mind. It would seem therefore that  we are always in danger of leaving out the half of that which is the  subject of our enquiry. We come at once upon the difficulty of what is  the meaning of the word. Does it differ as subject and object in the  same manner? Can we suppose one set of feelings or one part of the mind  to interpret another? Is the introspecting thought the same with the  thought which is introspected? Has the mind the power of surveying its  whole domain at one and the same time?--No more than the eye can take in  the whole human body at a glance. Yet there may be a glimpse round the  corner, or a thought transferred in a moment from one point of view to  another, which enables us to see nearly the whole, if not at once,  at any rate in succession. Such glimpses will hardly enable us to  contemplate from within the mind "]]]
