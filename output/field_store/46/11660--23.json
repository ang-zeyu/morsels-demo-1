And on the score of economy in construction,  repair, or accident, the plan here adopted is altogether preferable. In  this plan, the water is drawn from the boiler by the turning of a cock;  that from the cistern, by a minute's labor with the hand-pump. It is let  off by the drawing of a plug, and discharges, by a short pipe, into the  adjoining garden, or grassplat, to moisten and invigorate the trees and  plants which require it, and the whole affair is clean and sweet again.  A screen for the window gives all the privacy required, and the most  fastidious, shrinking female is as retired as in the shadiest nook of  her dressing-room.    So with water-closets. A fashion prevails of thrusting these noisome  things into the midst of sleeping chambers and living rooms--pandering  to effeminacy, and, at times, surcharging the house--for they cannot,  at _all_ times, and under _all_ circumstances, be kept perfectly  close--with their offensive odor. _Out_ of the house they belong; and if  they, by any means, find their way within its walls proper, the fault  will not be laid at our door.    To get back to our description. This bathing-room occupies a corner of  the wood-house.    A raised platform passes from the wash-room in, past the bath-room, to a  water-closet, which may be divided into two apartments, if desirable.  The vaults are accessible from the rear, for cleaning out, or  introducing lime, gypsum, powdered charcoal, or other deodorizing  material. At the extreme corner of the wood-house, a door opens into a  feed and swill-room, 20x8 feet, which is reached by steps, and stands  quite eighteen inches above the ground level, on a stone under-pinning,  or with a stone cellar beneath, for the storage of roots in winter. In  one corner of this is a boiler and chimney, for cooking food for the  pigs and chickens. A door leads from this room into the piggery, 20x12  feet, where half-a-dozen swine may be kept. A door leads from this pen  into a yard, in the rear, where they will be less offensive than if  confined within. If necessary, a flight of steps, leading to the loft  overhead, may be built, where corn can be stored for their feeding.    Next to this is the workshop and tool-house, 18x14 feet; and, in rear, a  snug, warm house for the family chickens, 18x6 feet. These chickens may  also have the run of the yard in rear, with the pigs, and apartments in  the loft overhead for roosting.    Adjoining the workshop is the carriage house, 18x18 feet, with a flight  of stairs to the hayloft above, in which is, also, a dovecote; and,  leading out of the carriage floor, is the stable, 18x12 feet, with  stalls for two or four horses, and a passage of four feet wide, from the  carriage-house into it; thus completing, and drawing under one  continuous roof, and at less exposure than if separated, the chief  every-day requirements of living, to a well-arranged and  highly-respectable family.    The chamber plan of the dwelling will be readily understood by reference  to its arrangement. There are a sufficiency of closets for all purposes,  and the whole are accessible from either flight of stairs. The rooms  over the wing, of course, should be devoted to the male domestics of the  family, work-people, &c.      SURROUNDING PLANTATIONS, SHRUBBERY, WALKS, ETC.    After the general remarks made in the preceding pages, no _particular_  instructions can be given for the manner in which this residence should  be embellished in its trees and shrubbery. The large forest trees,  always grand, graceful, and appropriate, would become such a house,  throwing a protecting air around and over its quiet, unpretending roof.  Vines, or climbing roses, might throw their delicate spray around the  columns of the modest veranda, and a varied selection of familiar  shrubbery and ornamental plants checker the immediate front and sides of  the house looking out upon the lawn; through which a spacious walk, or  carriage-way should wind, from the high road, or chief approach.    There are, however, so many objects to be consulted in the various sites  of houses, that no one rule can be laid down for individual guidance.  The surface of the ground immediately adjoining the house must be  considered; the position of the house, as it is viewed from surrounding  objects; its altitude, or depression, as affected by the adjacent lands;  its command upon surrounding near, or distant objects, in the way of  prospect; the presence of water, either in stream, pond, or lake, far or  near, or the absence of water altogether--all these enter immediately  into the manner in which the lawn of a house should be laid out, and  worked, and planted. But as a rule, all _filagree_ work, such as  serpentine paths, and tortuous, unmeaning circles, artificial piles of  rock, and a multitude of small _ornaments_--so esteemed, by some--should  never be introduced into the lawn of a _farm_ house. It is unmeaning,  in the first place; expensive in its care, in the second place;  unsatisfactory and annoying altogether. Such things about a farm  establishment are neither dignified nor useful, and should be left to  town's-people, having but a stinted appreciation of what constitutes  _natural_ beauty, and wanting to make the most of the limited piece of  ground of which they are possessed.    Nor would we shut out, by these remarks, the beauty and odor of the  flower-borders, which are so appropriately the care of the good matron  of the household and her comely daughters. To them may be devoted a  well-dug plat beneath the windows, or in the garden. Enough, and to  spare, they should always have, of such cheerful, life-giving pleasures.  We only object to their being strewed all over the ground,--a tussoc of  plant here, a patch of posey there, and a scattering of both everywhere,  without either system or meaning. They lower the dignity and simplicity  of the country dwelling altogether.    The business approach to this house is, of course, toward the stables  and carriage-house, and from them should lead off the main farm-avenue.    The kitchen garden, if possible, should lie on the kitchen side of the  house, where, also, should be placed the bee-house, in full sight from  the windows, that their labors and swarming may be watched. In fact, the  entire economy of the farm house, and its appendages, should be brought  close under the eye of the household, to engage their care and  watchfulness, and to interest them in all the little associations and  endearments--and they are many, when properly studied out--which go to  make agricultural life one of the most agreeable pursuits, if not  altogether so, in which our lot in life may be cast.    A fruit-garden, too, should be a prominent object near this house. We  are now advancing somewhat into the _elegances_ of agricultural life;  and although fruit trees, and _good_ fruits too, should hold a strong  place in the surroundings of even the humblest of all country  places--sufficient, at least, for the ample use of the family--they have  not yet been noticed, to any extent, in those already described. It may  be remarked, that the fruit-_garden_--the _orchard_, for market  purposes, is not here intended--should be placed in near proximity to  the house. All the _small_ fruits, for household use, such as  strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, blackberries, grapes,  as well as apricots, plums, nectarines, peaches, pears, apples, quinces,  or whatever fruits may be cultivated, in different localities, should be  close by, for the convenience of collecting them, and to protect them  from destruction by vermin, birds, or the depredations of creatures  _called_ human.    A decided plan of arrangement for all the plantations and grounds,  should enter into the composition of the site for the dwelling,  out-houses, gardens, &c., as they are to appear when the whole  establishment is completed; and nothing left to accident, chance, or  after-thought, which can be disposed of at the commencement. By the  adoption of such a course, the entire composition is more easily  perfected, and with infinitely greater expression of character, than if  left to the chance designs, or accidental demands of the future.    Another feature should be strictly enforced, in the outward appointments  of the farm house,--and that is, the entire withdrawal of any use of the  highway, in its occupation by the stock of the farm, except in leading  them to and from its enclosures. Nothing looks more slovenly, and  nothing can be more unthrifty, in an _enclosed_ country, than the  running of farm stock in the highway. What so untidy as the approach to  a house, with a herd of filthy hogs rooting about the fences, basking  along the sidewalk, or feeding at a huge, uncouth, hollowed log, in the  road near the dwelling. It may be out of place here to speak of it, but  this disgusting spectacle has so often offended our sight, at the  approach of an otherwise pleasant farm establishment, that we cannot  forego the opportunity to speak of it. The road lying in front, or  between the different sections of the farm, should be as well, and as  cleanly kept as any portion of the enclosures, and it is equally a sin  against good taste and neighborhood-morality, to have it otherwise.      TREE-PLANTING IN THE HIGHWAY.    This is frequently recommended by writers on country embellishment, as  indispensable to a finished decoration of the farm. Such may, or may not  be the fact. Trees shade the roads, when planted on their sides, and so  they partially do the fields adjoining, making the first muddy, in bad  weather, by preventing the sun drying them, and shading the crops of the  last by their overhanging foliage, in the season of their growth. Thus  they are an evil, in moist and heavy soils. Yet, in light soils, their  shade is grateful to the highway traveler, and not, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#18)"],[1,", and were condemned to severe manual labour, fulfilling  the duties usually executed by the lay brothers, who acted as  farmservants.  The outlying farming establishments belonging to  the monastic foundations were known as villae or granges.  They gave employment to a body of conversi and labourers  under the management of a monk, who bore the title of Brother  Hospitaller ---the granges, like their parent institutions,  affording shelter and hospitality to belated travellers.

(E. V.)    ABBON OF FLEURY, or ABBO FLORIACENSIS (c. 945-1004), a  learned Frenchman, born near Orleans about 945. He distinguished  himself in the schools of Paris and Reims, and was especially  proficient in science as known in his time.  He spent two  years in England, assisting Archbishop Oswald of York in  restoring the monastic system, and was abbot of Romsey.  After  his return to France he was made abbot of Fleury on the Loire  (988).  He was twice sent to Rome by King Robert the Pious  (986, 996), and on each occasion succeeded in warding off a  threatened papal interdict.  He was killed at La Reole in  1004, in endeavouring to quell a monkish revolt.  He wrote an  Epitomie de vitis Romanorum pontificum, besides controversial  treatises, letters, &c. (see Migne, Patrologia Latina, vol.  139).  His life, written by his disciple Aimoin of Fleury, in  which much of Abbon's correspondence was reproduced, is of great  importance as a source for the reign of Robert II., especially  with reference to the papacy (cf. Migne, op. cit. vol. 139).    See Ch. Pfister, Etudes sur le regne de Robert le Pieux (1885);  Cuissard-Gaucheron, ``L'Ecole de Fleury-sur-Loire a la fin du 10  siecle,'' in Memoires de la societe de l'Orleanais, xiv.  (Orleans, 1875); A. Molinier, Sources de l'histoire de France.    ABBOT, EZRA (1819--1884), American biblical scholar, was  born at Jackson, Waldo county, Maine, on the 28th of April  1819.  He graduated at Bowdoin College in 1840; and in  1847, at the request of Prof.  Andrews Norton, went to  Cambridge, where he was principal of a public school until  1856.  He was assistant librarian of Harvard University from  1856 to 1872, and planned and perfected an alphabetical card  catalogue, combining many of the advantages of the ordinary  dictionary catalogues with the grouping of the minor topics  under more general heads, which is characteristic of a systematic  catalogue.  From 1872 until his death he was Bussey Professor  of New Testament Criticism and Interpretation in the Harvard  Divinity School.  His studies were chiefly in Oriental languages  and the textual criticism of the New Testament, thoygh his  work as a bibliographer showed such results as the exhaustive  list of writings (5300 in all) on the doctrine of the future  life, appended to W. R. Alger's History of the Doctrine of  a Future Life, as it has prevailed in all Nations and Ages  (1862), and published separately in 1864.  His publications,  though always of the most thorough and scholarly character,  were to a large extent dispersed in the pages of reviews,  dictionaries, concordances, texts edited by others, Unitarian  controversial treatises, &c.; but he took a more conspicuous  and more personal part in the preparation (with the Baptist  scholar, Horatio B. Hackett) of the enlarged American edition  of Dr (afterwards Sir) William Smith's Dictionary of the  Bible (1867-1870), to which he contributed more than 400  articles besides greatly improving the bibliographical  completeness of the work; was an efficient member of the  American revision committee employed in connexion with the  Revised Version (1881-1885) of the King James Bible; and aided  in the preparation of Caspar Rene Gregory's Prolegomena to  the revised Greek New Testament of Tischendorf.  His principal  single production, representing his scholarly method and  conservative conclusions, was The Authorship af the Fourth  Gospel: External Evidences (1880; second edition, by J. H.  Thayer, with other essays, 1889), originally a lecture, and  in spite of the compression due to its form, up to that time  probably the ablest defence, based on external evidence,  of the Johannine authorship, and certainly the completest  treatment of the relation of Justin Martyr to this gospel.  Abbot, though a layman, received the degree of S. T. D. from  Harvard in 1872, and that of D.D. from Edinburgh in 1884. . He  died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the 21st of March 1884.    See S. J. Barrows, Ezra Abbot (Cambridge, Mass., 1884).    ABBOT, GEORGE (1562-1633), English divine, archbishop of  Canterbury, was born on the 19th of October 1562, at Guildford in  Surrey, where his father was a cloth-worker.  He studied, and  then taught, at Balliol College, Oxford, was chosen master of  University College in 1597, and appointed dean of Winchester in  1600.  He was three times vice-chancellor of the university,  and took a leading part in preparing the authorized version  of the New Testament.  In 1608 he went to Scotland with the  earl of Dunbar to arrange for a union between the churches  of England and Scotland.  He so pleased the king (James  I.) in this affair that he was made bishop of Lichfield and  Coventry in 1609, was translated to the see of London a month  afterwards, and in less than a year was raised to that of  Canterbury.  His puritan instincts frequently led him not  only into harsh treatment of Roman Catholics, but also into  courageous resistance to the royal will, e.g. when he  opposed the scandalous divorce suit of the Lady Frances Howard  against the earl of Essex, and again in 1618 when, at Croydon,  he forbade the reading of the declaration permitting Sunday  sports.  He was naturally, therefore, a promoter of the match  between the elector palatine and the Princess Elizabeth,  and a firm opponent of the projected marriage of the prince  of Wales with the infanta of Spain.  This policy brought  upon him the hatred of Laud (with whom he had previously  come into collision at Oxford) and the court, though the  king himself never forsook him.  In 1622, while hunting in  Lord Zouch's park at Bramshill, Hampshire, a bolt from his  cross-bow aimed at a deer happened to strike one of the  keepers, who died within an hour, and Abbot was so greatly  distressed by the event that he fell into a state of settled  melancholy.  His enemies maintained that the fatal issue of  this accident disqualified him for his office, and argued  that, though the homicide was involuntary, the sport of  hunting which had led to it was one in which no clerical  person could lawfully indulge.  The king had to refer the  matter to a commission of ten, though he said that ``an angel  might have miscarried after this sort.'' The commission was  equally divided, and the king gave a casting vote in the  archbishop's favour, though signing also a formal pardon or  dispensation.  After this the archbishop seldom appeared  at the council, chiefly on account of his infirmities.  He  attended the king constantly, however, in his last illness,  and performed the ceremony of the coronation of Charles I.  His refusal to license the assize sermon preached by Dr Robert  Sibthorp at Northampton on the 22nd of February 1626-1627, in  which cheerful obedience was urged to the king's demand for a  general loan, and the duty proclaimed of absolute non-resistance  even to the most arbitrary royal commands, led Charles to  deprive him of his functions as primate, putting them in  commission.  The need of summoning parliament, however,  soon brought about a nominal restoration of the archbishop's  powers.  His presence being unwelcome at court, he lived  from that time in retirement, leaving Laud and his party in  undisputed ascendancy.  He died at Croydon on the 5th of August  1633, and was buried at Guildford, his native place, where  he had endowed a hospital with lands to the value of L. 300 a  year.  Abbot was a conscientious prelate, though narrow in view  and often harsh towards both separatists and Romanists.  He  wrote a large number of works, the most interesting being his  discursive Exposition on the Prophet Jonah (1600), which was  reprinted in 1845.  His Geography, or a Brief Description  of the Whole World (1599), passed through numerous editions.    The best account of him is in S. R. Gardiner's History of England.    ABBOT, GEORGE (1603-1648), English writer, known as ``The  Puritan,'' has been oddly and persistently mistaken for  others.  He has been described as a clergyman, which he never  was, and as son of Sir Morris (or Maurice) Abbot, and his  writings accordingly entered in the bibliographical authorities  as by the nephew of the archbishop of Canterbury.  One of the  sons of Sir Morris Abbot was, indeed, named George, and he  was a man of mark, but the more famous George Abbot was of a  different family altogether.  He was son or grandson (it is  not clear which) of Sir Thomas Abbot, knight of Easington,  East Yorkshire, having been born there in 1603--1604,  his mother (or grandmother) being of the ancient house of  Pickering.  Of his early life and training nothing is  known.  He married a daughter of Colonel Purefoy of Caldecote,  Warwickshire, and as his monument, which may still be seen  in the church there, tells, he bravely held the manor house  against Princes Rupert and Maurice during the civil war.  As  a layman, and nevertheless a theologian and scholar of rare  ripeness and critical ability, he holds an almost unique  place in the literature of the period.  The terseness of his  Whole Booke of Job Paraphrased, or made easy for any to  understand (1640, 4to), contrasts favourably with the usual  prolixity of the Puritan expositors and"]]]
