The spirit of the age, taken on the whole, is  irreligious. Man's outlook on life is too crude and materialistic to  enable him to elevate himself into the higher realms of the spirit.    \"It is this condition, so sadly morbid, into which society has fallen,  that religion seeks to improve and transform. For the core of religious  faith is that mystic feeling which unites Man with God. This state of  spiritual communion can be brought about and maintained by means of  meditation and prayer. And this is the reason why Baha'u'llah has so much  stressed the importance of worship. It is not sufficient for a believer  merely to accept and observe the teachings. He should, in addition,  cultivate the sense of spirituality which he can acquire chiefly by means  of prayer. The Baha'i Faith, like all other Divine Religions, is thus  fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal is the development of  the individual and society, through the acquisition of spiritual virtues  and powers. It is the soul of man which has first to be fed. And this  spiritual nourishment prayer can best provide.    \"Laws and institutions, as viewed by Baha'u'llah, can become really  effective only when our inner spiritual life has been perfected and  transformed. Otherwise religion will degenerate into a mere organization,  and becomes a dead thing. The believers, particularly the young ones,  should therefore fully realize the necessity of praying. For prayer is  absolutely indispensable to their inner spiritual development, and this,  as already stated, is the very foundation and purpose of the religion of  God.\"            224: YOUTH, JUNIOR (DO GREAT DEEDS)      \"He urges you to make up your minds to do great, great deeds for the  Faith; the condition of the world is steadily growing worse, and your  generation must provide the saints, heroes, martyrs and administrators of  future years. With dedication and will power you can rise to great  heights!\"    \"He appreciates very much the devoted and determined spirit with which you  are facing the future and all the Baha'i responsibility it will bring you  increasingly. The part of youth is very great; you have the opportunity to  really determine to exemplify in word and deed the Teachings of  Baha'u'llah, and to show your generation that the New World Order He has  brought is a tangible reality in the lives of His followers.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#18)"],[1," such high teaching mission, as well as to our  new Baha'i brother Moulvi Abdullah of Kashmir who, notwithstanding the  violent opposition and criticisms of the Qadianis has firmly stood by the  Cause, the Guardian wishes you to convey his warmest appreciation and  gratitude.          Financial Assistance to Baha'i Teachers      In connection with your teaching campaign, the Guardian wishes you to  inform the N.S.A. that although there exists in the Cause no such  institution as that of paid teachers, the N.S.A. nevertheless should, in  view of the urgent and pressing requirements of the Six-Year Plan, extend,  though only temporarily, any financial assistance in its power to those  believers who offer to undertake pioneer work throughout India and Burma.  Also, those believers who are not themselves able to offer their services  as pioneers, and who wish to directly and effectively participate in the  campaign of teaching can instead offer to defray, through the National  Fund, the expenses of any believer they choose to deputize for that  purpose. Such deputy teachers, however, should for all other purposes be  responsible to the N.S.A. and the teaching bodies concerned. Great Message  Can Redeem Bewildered Humanity    [From the Guardian:]    I regret that owing to present circumstances arising from the war and its  grave repercussions, the activities, particularly in the teaching field,  connected with the Six-Year Plan, so spontaneously initiated by your  Assembly, have had to be curtailed. I wish to appeal, however, to all its  members, and through them to the general body of the devoted friends in  India and Burma to make a united and supreme endeavour to overcome, while  there is yet time, the obstacles that stand in their way, and to refuse to  allow the perils, the uncertainties and anxieties that face and afflict  their country to deter them from carrying out the original plan they have  so nobly conceived. Let them remember that a firm resolution on their  part, an absolute rededication of their resources, and an actual attempt  to translate into action their meritorious intentions, coupled with  perseverance in the discharge of their duties, would suffice to ensure the  success of the mission to which they are now committed. The time is indeed  ripe, and the minds and hearts of the suffering multitudes are being  mysteriously prepared for the Great Message that can alone redeem, exalt  and regenerate a sore-tried and bewildered humanity. I will specially and  fervently pray for the success of any and every effort the dearly-beloved  friends in India and Burma may arise to exert.    November 28, 1940          Translation of Baha'u'llah's Writings      Regarding his instruction to the N.S.A. of Iran to the effect that  Baha'u'llah's writings in Arabic should not be translated into Persian;  this applies to the translation of the revealed words into Persian only.  Your Assembly, therefore, may proceed with its plan for the rendering of  the Tablet of Ahmad, the three daily obligatory prayers and other Tablets,  into Urdu.    . . . .    With reference to ... question whether it is permissible for the Baha'is  to see pictures; there is nothing in the Teachings that would forbid such  a practice.    . . . .    Also with regard to the practice of circumcision; the Teachings bear no  reference to this matter, and it is therefore not enjoined upon the  believers.          Training of Children      The question of the training and education of children in case one of the  parents is a non-Baha'i is one which solely concerns the parents  themselves, who should decide about it the way they find best and most  conducive to the maintenance of the unity of their family, and to the  future welfare of their children. Once the child comes of age, however, he  should be given full freedom to choose his religion, irrespective of the  wishes and desires of his parents. Membership of the International House  of Justice    As regards the membership of the International House of Justice,  Abdu'l-Baha states in a Tablet that it is confined to men, and that the  wisdom of it will be revealed as manifest as the sun in the future. In any  case the believers should know that, as Abdu'l-Baha Himself has explicitly  stated that sexes are equal except in some cases, the exclusion of women  from the International House of Justice, should not be surprising. From  the fact that there is no equality of functions between the sexes one  should not, however, infer that either sex is inherently superior or  inferior to the other, or that they are unequal in their rights.          Appearance of two Davids      Concerning the appearance of two Davids; there is a Tablet from  Abdu'l-Baha in which He says that just as there have been two Ishmaels,  one the son of Abraham, and the other one of the Prophets of Israel, there  have appeared two Davids, one the author of the Psalms and father of  Solomon, and the other before Moses.          Importance of the Teaching Campaign      The Guardian wishes me once again to stress the all-importance of the  teaching campaign throughout India and Burma. Much as he is aware of the  obstacles that stand in the way of the expansion of pioneer  teaching--obstacles which your sister Assembly in the U.S.A. are far in a  better position to overcome, owing to the larger resources at their  disposal and to their longer and wider experience in matters of  teaching--he nevertheless strongly feels that, through the united,  determined and passionate resolve of your N.S.A., of all the local  Assemblies, groups and individuals, much can be accomplished in that  direction, and firm foundations laid down for future expansion and  consolidation. The greater your handicaps the firmer your determination  should wax, and the more abundant will assuredly be the blessings and  confirmations of Baha'u'llah. May His love and guidance lead you and our  dearly-beloved friends in that land to still greater heights of selfless  accomplishment in His path, and thereby crown with success the Six-Year  Plan so ably devised and so energetically pursued by the N.S.A.    [From the Guardian:]    I wish to reassure you in person of my fervent and continued prayers for  the protection, the success and the spiritual advancement of the community  of the Indian and Burmese believers who, under your direction, and  stimulated by the initiative and example, of their national elected  representatives, are arising, in these days of widespread confusion,  turmoil and danger, to carry out the Plan they are pledged to fulfil. No  sacrifice can be regarded as too great for the attainment of so great and  splendid an objective. They should persevere in their task, undaunted by  the rising tide of calamity and despair which afflicts the world, and  which is mysteriously paving the way for its unification and ultimate  redemption. May the Beloved guide every step you take, and bless every  endeavour you exert in His path.    December 14, 1940          Greatest Need of the Hour      Whenever the Guardian receives news of the spread of the Cause it brings  him fresh hope and helps to lighten his heavy burden. This is the greatest  need of the present hour in India; more teachers in new fields! His  prayers are always being offered for the advancement of this all-important  work and the fulfilment of the Six-Year Teaching Plan.    April 19, 1941          Priceless Days      He was very happy to note the spirit of true and profound dedication to  their holy task of spreading the Faith in India and Burma which the  members of the N.S.A. manifest, and he feels sure that, if they exert the  utmost effort, they will, through the confirmations of Baha'u'llah,  succeed in fulfilling what is required of them under the Six-Year Plan.    He regrets very much that circumstances have prevented any active  furtherance of the teaching work during the past Baha'i year. Because of  this the Guardian felt impelled, after reading your Assembly's letter, to  transmit by cable the sum of two hundred pounds sterling to be set aside  by your Assembly as the nucleus of a special fund to be established for  the specific purpose of furthering the all-India teaching campaign of the  Six-Year Plan. He trusts that this will stimulate the body of Indian and  Burmese Baha'is to also contribute to this fund generously and by  providing the necessary means to enable them to speedily fulfil the task  they have vowed to carry out.    Concerning the methods to be adopted for the realization of your urgent  task, Shoghi Effendi approves of the suggestion that some business firms  open branches in new districts and thus provide Baha'i settlement by this  means. However, he feels that this will not be enough, and that all the  Spiritual Assemblies, as well as each individual believer, should rally to  this great opportunity which, indeed, may not again be presented to them,  of spreading the Faith through the length and breadth of India while they  are still in a position to do so. The world is day by day becoming  increasingly involved in this cataclysmic struggle, but so far the Baha'is  of India, Australia, New Zealand and the American continents have not felt  either the dangers or the restrictions imposed on less fortunate  communities which find themselves either over-run and temporarily  eclipsed, or in the actual theatre of war. Therefore the believers of  India should not allow these truly priceless days to slip by without  exerting themselves to the utmost and sacrificing comfort, home, and  money, to the great duty of giving the Divine Message to the people of  their vast country.    Smallness of numbers, lack of skilled teachers, and modesty of means  should not discourage or deter them. They must remember the glorious  history of the Cause, which, both in East and West, was established by  dedicated souls who, for the most part, were neither rich, famous, nor  well educated, but "]]]
