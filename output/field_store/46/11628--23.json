[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19317"],[0,"Gallipoli Diary,  Volume 1 (#18)"],[1,"quotes the number of my question and adds, \"The rumour  is baseless.\" Well, \"_tant pis_,\" as Guepratte would say with a shrug of  his shoulders. Our first step won't have the weight behind it we had  permitted ourselves for some hours to hope. _Everywhere_ the first is  the step that counts but _nowhere_ more so than in an Oriental War.    Now that the French Division has been snuffed out, how about the Grand  Duke Nicholas, General Istomine and their Russian Divisions? Are they  also to prove phantoms? Certainly, in some form or another, they ought  to be brought into our scheme and, even if only at a distance, bring  some pressure to bear upon the Turks at the time of our opening move. I  think my best way of getting into touch will be by wireless from de  Robeck to the Russian Admiral in the Black Sea.    Dick dines, also Birdwood.    _15th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ Boarded H.M.S. _Dublin_  (Captain Kelly) at 9.30 this morning, where Admiral de Robeck met me.  Sailed at once and dropped anchor off Tenedos at noon.    Landed and made a close inspection of the Aerodrome where we were taken  round by two young friends of mine, Commander Samson and Captain Davies,  Naval Air Service. By a queer fluke these are the very two men with whom  I did my very first flight! On that never to be forgotten day Samson  took up Winston and Davies took me. Like mallards we shot over the  Medway and saw the battleships as if they were little children's  playthings far away down below us. Now the children are going to use  their pretty toys and will make a nice noise with them in the world.    After lunch spent the best part of two hours in a small cottage with  Samson and Keyes trying to digest the honey brought back by our busy  aeroplane bees from their various flights over Gallipoli. The Admiral  went off on some other naval quest.    Samson and Davies are fliers of the first water--and not only in the  air. They carry the whole technique of their job at their finger tips.  The result of K.'s washing his hands of the Air is that the Admiralty  run that element entirely. Samson is Boss. He has brought with him two  Maurice Farmans and three B.E.2s. The Maurice Farmans with 100 H.P.  Renaults; the B.E.2s with 70 Renaults. These five machines are good  although one of the B.E.2s is dead old.    Also, he brought eight Henri Farmans with 80 Gnome engines. He took them  because they were new and there was nothing else new; but they are no  use for war.    Two B.E.2C.s with 70 Renaults: these are absolutely useless as they  won't take a passenger.    One Broguet 200 H.P. Canton engine; won't fly.    Two Sopwith Scouts: 80 Gnome engines; very old and can't be used owing  to weakness of engine mounting.    One very old but still useful Maurice Farman with 140 Canton engine.  That is the demnition total and it pans out at five serviceable  aeroplanes for the Army. There are also some seaplanes with us but they  are not under Samson, and are purely for naval purposes. Amongst those  are two good \"Shorts,\" but the others are no use, they say, being wrong  type and underpowered.    The total nominal strength of Samson's Corps is eleven pilots and one  hundred and twenty men. As everyone knows, no Corps or Service is ever  up to its nominal strength; least of all an Air Corps. The dangerous  shortage is that in two-seater aeroplanes as we want our Air Service now  for spotting and reconnaissances. If, _after_ that requirement had been  met, we had only a bombing force at our disposal, the Gallipoli  Peninsula, being a very limited space with only one road and two or  three harbours on it, could probably be made untenable.    Commander Samson's estimate of a minimum force for this \"stunt,\" as he  calls our great enterprise, is 30 good two-seater machines; 24 fighters;  40 pilots and 400 men. So equipped he reckons he could take the  Peninsula by himself and save us all a vast lot of trouble.    But, strange as it may seem, flying is not my \"stunt.\" I dare not even  mention the word \"aeroplane\" to K., and I have cut myself off from  correspondence with Winston. I did this thing deliberately as  Braithwaite reminds me every time I am tempted to sit down and unbosom  myself to one who would sympathise and lend us a hand if he could: in  truth, I am torn in two about this; but I still feel it is wiser and  better so; not only from the K. point of view but also from de Robeck's.  He (de Robeck) might be quite glad I should write once to Winston on one  subject but he would never be sure afterwards I was not writing on  others. On the way back I spoke to the Admiral, but I don't know whether  he will write himself or not. Ventured also a little bit out of my own  element in another direction, and begged him not to put off sending the  submarine through the Straits until the day of our landing, but to let  her go directly she was ready. He does not agree. He has an idea (I hope  a premonition) that the submarine will catch Enver hurrying down to the  scene of action if we wait till the day of the attack.    Even more than in the Fleet I find in the Air Service the profound  conviction that, if they could only get into direct touch with Winston  Churchill, all would be well. Their faith in the First Lord is, in every  sense, _touching_. But they can't get the contact and they are  thoroughly imbued with the idea that the Sea Lords are at the best  half-hearted; at the worst, actively antagonistic to us and to the whole  of our enterprise. The photographs, etc., I have studied make it only  too clear that the Turks have not let the grass grow under their feet  since the first bombardment; the Peninsula, in fact, is better defended  than it was. _Per contra_ the momentum, precision, swiftness and staying  power of our actual attack will be at least twice as great now as it  would have been at the end of March.    Returned to Lemnos about 7.30 p.m.    While we were away my Staff got aboard the destroyer _Colne_ and steamed  in her to the mouth of the Dardanelles. There the whole precious load of  red tabs transshipped to H.M.S. _Triumph_ (Captain Fitzmaurice), who  forthwith took up her station opposite Morto Bay and began firing salvos  with her 6-inch guns at the trenches on the face of the hill. At first  the Staff watched the show with much enjoyment from the bridge, but  when howitzers from the Asiatic side began to lob shell over the ship,  the Captain hustled them all into the conning tower. The Turks seem to  have shot pretty straight. The first three fell fifty yards short of the  ship; the fourth shell about twenty yards over her. The next three got  home. One cut plumb through the bridge (where all my brains had been  playing about two minutes previously) and burst on the deck just outside  the conning tower. Some cordite cartridges were lying outside of it and  these went off with a great flare. Another struck the funnel and the  third came in on the waterline. Fifteen more shells were then fired with  just a little bit too much elevation and passed over. Only two men were  wounded,--fractured legs. Captain Fitzmaurice now decided that honour  and dignity were satisfied and so fell back slowly towards Cape Helles  to try the effect of his guns on the barbed wire entanglements. A good  deal of ammunition was expended but only one hit on the entanglement was  registered, and that did not seem to do any harm. The fire was described  to me as inaccurate. The fact is, as was agreed between the two services  at Malta, the whole principle of naval gunnery is different from the  principles of garrison or field artillery shooting. Before they will be  much good at landmarks, the sailors will have to take lessons in the  art.    Passed a very interesting evening, every one excited, I with my  aeroplane reports; the Staff with the powder they had smelt.    Two of the Australian Commanding Officers dined and I showed them the  aerial photographs of the enemy trenches, etc. The face of one of them  grew very long; so long, in fact, that I feared he was afraid; for I own  these photos are frightening. So I said, \"You don't seem to like the  look of that barbed wire, Colonel?\" To which he replied, \"I was worrying  how and where I would feed and water the prisoners.\"    _16th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ Spent the forenoon in  interviews beginning at 10 a.m. with de Robeck and Mr. Fitzmaurice, late  dragoman at the Embassy at Constantinople. Mr. Fitzmaurice says the  Turks will put up a great fight at the Dardanelles. They had believed in  the British Navy, and, a month ago, they were shaking in their shoes.  But they had not believed in the British Army or that a body so  infinitely small would be so saucy as to attack them on their own chosen  ground. Even now, he says, they can hardly credit their spies, or their  eyes, and it ought to be easy enough to make them think all this is a  blind, and that we are really going to Smyrna or Adramiti. They are fond  of saying, \"If the English are fools enough to enter our mouth we only  have to close it.\" Enver especially brags he will make very short work  with us if we set foot so near to the heart of his Empire, and gives it  out that the whole of us will be marching through the streets of  Constantinople, not as conquerors, but as prisoners, within a week from  the date of our making the attempt. All the same, despite this bragging,  the Turks realise that if we were to get the Fleet through the Narrows;  or, if it were to force its own way through whilst we absorb the  attention of their mobile guns, the game would be up. So they are  straining every nerve to be ready for anything. The moral of all these  rather contradictory remarks is just what I have said time and again  since South Africa. The fact that war has become a highly scientific  business should not blind us to the other fact that its roots still draw  their nutriment from primitive feelings and methods; the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#18)"],[1,"truth is proved by blood.         But blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth; blood       poisoneth even the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and       hatred in the heart.         And when one goeth through fire for his teaching--what doth that       prove? Verily, it is more when one's teaching cometh out of one's       own burning![26]    [26] The quotations are from \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" ii, 24: \"Of  Priests.\"      54.    Do not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are sceptical.  Zarathustra is a sceptic. The strength, the _freedom_ which proceed from  intellectual power, from a superabundance of intellectual power,  _manifest_ themselves as scepticism. Men of fixed convictions do not  count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and  lack of values. Men of convictions are prisoners. They do not see far  enough, they do not see what is _below_ them: whereas a man who would  talk to any purpose about value and non-value must be able to see five  hundred convictions _beneath_ him--and _behind_ him.... A mind that  aspires to great things, and that wills the means thereto, is  necessarily sceptical. Freedom from any sort of conviction _belongs_ to  strength, and to an independent point of view.... That grand passion  which is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptic's existence,  and is both more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself,  drafts the whole of his intellect into its service; it makes him  unscrupulous; it gives him courage to employ unholy means; under certain  circumstances it does not _begrudge_ him even convictions. Conviction as  a means: one may achieve a good deal by means of a conviction. A grand  passion makes use of and uses up convictions; it does not yield to  them--it knows itself to be sovereign.--On the contrary, the need of  faith, of something unconditioned by yea or nay, of Carlylism, if I may  be allowed the word, is a need of _weakness_. The man of faith, the  \"believer\" of any sort, is necessarily a dependent man--such a man  cannot posit _himself_ as a goal, nor can he find goals within himself.  The \"believer\" does not belong to himself; he can only be a means to an  end; he must be _used up_; he needs some one to use him up. His instinct  gives the highest honours to an ethic of self-effacement; he is prompted  to embrace it by everything: his prudence, his experience, his vanity.  Every sort of faith is in itself an evidence of self-effacement, of  self-estrangement.... When one reflects how necessary it is to the great  majority that there be regulations to restrain them from without and  hold them fast, and to what extent control, or, in a higher sense,  _slavery_, is the one and only condition which makes for the well-being  of the weak-willed man, and especially woman, then one at once  understands conviction and \"faith.\" To the man with convictions they are  his backbone. To _avoid_ seeing many things, to be impartial about  nothing, to be a party man through and through, to estimate all values  strictly and infallibly--these are conditions necessary to the existence  of such a man. But by the same token they are _antagonists_ of the  truthful man--of the truth.... The believer is not free to answer the  question, \"true\" or \"not true,\" according to the dictates of his own  conscience: integrity on _this_ point would work his instant downfall.  The pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of convictions  into a fanatic--Savonarola, Luther, Rousseau, Robespierre,  Saint-Simon--these types stand in opposition to the strong,  _emancipated_ spirit. But the grandiose attitudes of these _sick_  intellects, these intellectual epileptics, are of influence upon the  great masses--fanatics are picturesque, and mankind prefers observing  poses to listening to _reasons_....      55.    --One step further in the psychology of conviction, of \"faith.\" It is  now a good while since I first proposed for consideration the question  whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than  lies. (\"Human, All-Too-Human,\" I, aphorism 483.)[27] This time I desire  to put the question definitely: is there any actual difference between  a lie and a conviction?--All the world believes that there is; but what  is not believed by all the world!--Every conviction has its history, its  primitive forms, its stage of tentativeness and error: it _becomes_ a  conviction only after having been, for a long time, _not_ one, and then,  for an even longer time, _hardly_ one. What if falsehood be also one of  these embryonic forms of conviction?--Sometimes all that is needed is a  change in persons: what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in  the son.--I call it lying to refuse to see what one sees, or to refuse  to see it _as_ it is: whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not  before witnesses is of no consequence. The most common sort of lie is  that by which a man deceives himself: the deception of others is a  relatively rare offence.--Now, this will _not_ to see what one sees,  this will _not_ to see it as it is, is almost the first requisite for  all who belong to a party of whatever sort: the party man becomes  inevitably a liar. For example, the German historians are convinced that  Rome was synonymous with despotism and that the Germanic peoples brought  the spirit of liberty into the world: what is the difference between  this conviction and a lie? Is it to be wondered at that all partisans,  including the German historians, instinctively roll the fine phrases of  morality upon their tongues--that morality almost owes its very  _survival_ to the fact that the party man of every sort has need of it  every moment?--\"This is _our_ conviction: we publish it to the whole  world; we live and die for it--let us respect all who have  convictions!\"--I have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of  anti-Semites. On the contrary, gentlemen! An anti-Semite surely does not  become more respectable because he lies on principle.... The priests,  who have more finesse in such matters, and who well understand the  objection that lies against the notion of a conviction, which is to say,  of a falsehood that becomes a matter of principle _because_ it serves a  purpose, have borrowed from the Jews the shrewd device of sneaking in  the concepts, \"God,\" \"the will of God\" and \"the revelation of God\" at  this place. Kant, too, with his categorical imperative, was on the same  road: this was his _practical_ reason.[28] There are questions regarding  the truth or untruth of which it is _not_ for man to decide; all the  capital questions, all the capital problems of valuation, are beyond  human reason.... To know the limits of reason--_that_ alone is genuine  philosophy.... Why did God make a revelation to man? Would God have done  anything superfluous? Man _could_ not find out for himself what was good  and what was evil, so God taught him His will.... Moral: the priest does  _not_ lie--the question, \"true\" or \"untrue,\" has nothing to do with such  things as the priest discusses; it is impossible to lie about these  things. In order to lie here it would be necessary to know _what_ is  true. But this is more than man _can_ know; therefore, the priest is  simply the mouthpiece of God.--Such a priestly syllogism  is by no means merely Jewish and Christian; the right to lie and the  _shrewd dodge_ of \"revelation\" belong to the general priestly type--to  the priest of the _decadence_ as well as to the priest of pagan times  (--Pagans are all those who say yes to life, and to whom \"God\" is a word  signifying acquiescence in all things).--The \"law,\" the \"will of God,\"  the \"holy book,\" and \"inspiration\"--all these things are merely words  for the conditions _under_ which the priest comes to power and _with_  which he maintains his power,--these concepts are to be found at the  bottom of all priestly organizations, and of all priestly or  priestly-philosophical schemes of governments. The \"holy lie\"--common  alike to Confucius, to the Code of Manu, to Mohammed and to the  Christian church--is not even wanting in Plato. \"Truth is here\": this  means, no matter where it is heard, _the priest lies_....    [27] The aphorism, which is headed \"The Enemies of Truth,\" makes the  direct statement: \"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than  lies.\"    [28] A reference, of course, to Kant's \"Kritik der praktischen Vernunft\"  (Critique of Practical Reason).      56.    --In the last analysis it comes to this: what is the _end_ of lying? The  fact that, in Christianity, \"holy\" ends are not visible is _my_  objection to the means it employs. Only _bad_ ends appear: the  poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the  body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of  sin--_therefore_, its means are also bad.--I have a contrary feeling  when I read the Code of Manu, an incomparably more intellectual and  superior work, which it would be a sin against the _intelligence_ to so  much as _name_ in the same breath with the Bible. It is easy to see why:  there is a genuine philosophy behind it, _in_ it, not merely an  evil-smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism and superstition,--it gives even  the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into. And,  _not_ to forget what is most important, it differs fundamentally from  every kind of Bible: by means of it the _nobles_, the philosophers and  the warriors keep the whip-hand over the majority; it is full of noble  valuations, it shows a feeling of perfection, an acceptance of life, and  triumphant feeling toward self and life--the _sun_ shines upon the whole  book.--All the things on which Christianity vents its fathomless  vulgarity--for example, procreation, women and marriage--are here  handled earnestly, with reverence and with love and confidence.
