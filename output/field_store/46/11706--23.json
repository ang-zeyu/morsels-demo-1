It is probable from its appearance  that the monument contained two effigies, one representing the bishop  in his pontifical robes and another on a higher ledge, which  represented a body in a state of decay, as contrasting life and death.  A carved oak door at the foot of the monument appears as an entrance  to a chantry, or as by some supposed to have been a confessional. The  bishop was buried in the centre of the chapel; his favorite device--a  rebus of his name--a cock standing on a globe, and his arms may be  seen in the window and in several other places. The chapel has been  much defaced and many figures and ornaments have disappeared, but  something has been done towards restoration at the cost of the Master  and Fellows of Jesus College; the new portion of the floor was laid at  the cost of the Rev. Lord Aylwyne Compton; and we hope ere long to see  the east window filled with stained glass, which will contribute much  to its improvement.      +The Retro-Choir.+    This occupies the space of the two eastern bays of the Cathedral,  allowing a passage behind the altar-screen from one aisle to the  other, and affords a good position for a closer inspection of the  lower portions of the east window, under which are some remains of  ancient decoration on the wall.    Nearly under the central window, a memorial brass has been laid over  the grave of Canon Fardell, who died in 1854, and of his widow, who  died in 1861; to whose memories respectively the two stained glass  windows were inserted in the north aisle of the Choir, noticed in p.  79. Near this stands an ancient oaken chest, covered with elaborate  and curious ironwork, with four locks.    Behind the new altar-screen, beneath a large and costly slab of  Alexandrine mosaic, is the grave of Bishop Allen (1836-1845), to whose  memory a monument in white marble has been erected in the south aisle  of the Choir. A little further southward is a monument erected over  the grave of Dr. Mill, Canon of Ely, and Regius Professor of Hebrew in  the University of Cambridge, who died in 1853. It is an altar tomb of  serpentine and alabaster, ornamented with marble mosaic and polished  stones, bearing a recumbent effigy of Dr. Mill in his robes; at the  feet are two kneeling figures, one an oriental character, and the  other a student; the figure is in copper and was formed by the  electrotype process. It was designed by Sir G.G. Scott, and executed  by Mr. Philip.    In the eastern bay on the south side is a monument of Cardinal de  Luxemburg, Archbishop of Rouen, and Bishop of Ely (1438-1443). This  monument was for many years hidden by a screen, but on the removal of  the Choir the screen was taken away and the monument partially  restored, the figure remains but the head is gone. The Cardinal-bishop  died at Hatfield, and his body was buried at Ely, but his heart was  conveyed to his Cathedral at Rouen. The niches and canopies with their  finials in the tympanum of the arch above this monument will attract  attention, being chaste and elegant; they are similar to those in the  interior of Bishop West's chapel, but are in a more perfect state.      +South Aisle of the Choir.+    The eastern portion of this aisle is occupied by the elegant mortuary  +Chapel of Bishop West+, (1515-1534), filling the space of one bay in  a similar way to that of Bishop Alcock in the north aisle. It is a  rich specimen of that gorgeous style by some called the \"Florid  English,\" by others the \"Perpendicular,\" but when that style was  verging into \"Renaissance.\" The niches and canopies are very numerous,  and almost endless in variety of size, shape, and decoration. There  are places for upwards of two hundred statues, large and small; and  some of the carved heads were of medallion size, and well executed. It  is impossible to contemplate this beautiful oratory, even in its  mutilated state, but with feelings of admiration; the taste of the  designer, no less than the execution of the sculptor, are wonderful,  and although every part is covered with niches, pedestals, and  canopies, interspersed with relievos, grotesque designs and ornaments,  the whole appears light and airy. The ceilings of the canopies are  covered with tracery that can only be compared to lace-work  exquisitely varied and finished; the ceiling and pendents are  deserving attention; the former is divided into lozenge shaped  compartments of different sizes, all are coloured, and on many of them  are painted the arms of the see, and those of the founder of the  chapel; the pendents are formed by figures of angels holding the same  arms and those of Henry VIII. Over the door on the inside is this  inscription:         \"GRACIA DEI SUM QUOD ID SUM, A.D. 1534.\"    and the same without the date and the word \"id\" is to be seen in  several other places both within and without. The gates are worthy of  notice as originals, and as specimens of wrought-iron work of that  period. This chapel, which is the burial place of Bishop West, may be  compared with that built by him in the parish church of his  birth-place, Putney; but every part of it has suffered the most  barbarous mutilation, not a figure can be found perfect, all have been  removed or defaced, probably in consequence of an order in council  made A.D. 1547-8, against the Romish superstition, and for removing  images out of churches; or it might have been done by the Puritans in  the time of the Protector (Cromwell), whose soldiers it is stated,  made use of the Cathedral as stabling for their horses.    Bishop Keene (1771-1781), was also buried here; and Bishop Sparke  (1812-1836) and Mrs. Sparke were interred in this chapel, to whose  memories the monument at the east end has been erected, and the  stained glass window behind is inserted:         The window was executed by Mr. Evans, of Shrewsbury, and       contains figures of the four Evangelists, with St. John the       Baptist in the centre; the tracery being filled with       appropriate emblems and ornamental devices.    A slab of black marble, inlaid with a foliated cross, the arms of the  sees of Chester and Ely, and surrounded by an inscription in brass,  has been laid over the grave of Bishop Sparke, and the gravestones of  Bishops West and Keene have been replaced, and the remainder of the  floor laid with encaustic tiles.    Some fragments of stained glass may be seen in a window on the south  side, under which stand the remains of Bishop West's monument. Just  above this, in seven small arches, closed with as many stones  inscribed with names and dates, are immured the remains of seven  eminent persons[47] of the tenth and eleventh centuries, who were  originally interred in the Conventual church, but from which they were  removed in 1154, and the small chests which contained their remains,  were placed in the north wall of the Choir of the present Cathedral;  and when the position of the Choir was altered in 1770 they were again  removed, and deposited in their present resting places.    [Footnote 47: Wolstan, Archbishop of York; Osmund, a Swedish bishop;  Ednoth, Bishop of Dorchester (Lincoln); Alfwyn, Elfgar, and Athelstan,  severally Bishops of Elmham; and Brithnoth, Duke of Northumberland. An  interesting account of the removal of these remains may be found in  the Addenda to Bentham's History, vol. ii. p. 23, &c.]    The perspective view westward through the south aisles of the Choir  and the Nave is worthy of notice for the various intersections of the  arches and groinings, as seen from a narrow window in the west side of  the chapel, or from the door.    The architecture of the south aisle is similar to the north aisle, and  the windows were probably altered to their present form about the same  period as those in the north aisle. Five of them (as on the other  side) have been filled with stained glass:         The first window from the chapel, executed by Messrs.       Clayton and Bell, contains subjects taken from the Parables;       designed as a memorial of Astley Sparke, Esq., (son of the       Rev. Chancellor Sparke,) who was killed in the celebrated       cavalry charge at Balaclava in 1854.         The second window was executed by Mr. Cottingham, and       contains subjects from the history of Lazarus; the joint       gift of Lady Buxton and of her son, Sir Robert Buxton,       Bart., of Shadwell Park, Norfolk.         The third window contains incidents in the history of the       Saviour, and of St. John; executed by Messrs. Clayton and       Bell: the gift of Mrs. Pratt, youngest daughter of Bishop       Sparke.         The fourth window, by the same artists, contains subjects       illustrative of the history of St. Peter; the gift of the       same lady, as a memorial of her husband, Colonel Pratt.         The fifth window, by the same artists, contains subjects       illustrative of the history of our Lord: given by the same       lady.    Under the second window from the chapel is an arched recess, which is  thought to have formed an entrance to the church for the convenience  of the sisters and others attendant on the sick in the Infirmary which  stood near, but it has been closed on the exterior for many years. The  interior may have been since used as a receptacle for relics; now it  is occupied as a receptacle for a beautiful life-size effigy of Dr.  Selwyn, for upwards of forty years Canon of Ely, and for many years St  Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge;[48] who died in 1875. The  figure is represented as vested in cassock, surplice, and stole, with  the hands joined as in prayer, in white statuary marble, and resting  on a moulded base of Purbeck marble. The cost was defrayed by  subscriptions from several noblemen and gentlemen formerly Eton  scholars.

By  residents in the neighborhood it is known as Little Guinea. At the first  firing Philip, but partially dressed, seized gun and powder-horn and  made for the swamp, Captain Church's ambush was directly in his front.  An Englishman's piece missed fire, but an Indian sent a bullet through  the Great Sachem's heart.    In this fearful war at least six hundred of the English inhabitants  either fell in battle or were murdered by the enemy, A dozen or more  towns were utterly destroyed, others greatly damaged, Some six hundred  buildings, chiefly dwelling-houses, were consumed by fire, and over a  hundred thousand pounds of colonial money expended, to say nothing of  the immense losses in goods and cattle.    Not without propriety has the Pokanoket chief been denominated a king.  If not a Charlemagne or a Louis XIV., he yet possessed elements of true  greatness. While he lived his mind evidently guided, as his will  dominated and prolonged, the war. This is saying much, for the Indian's  disinclination to all strenuous or continuous exertion was pronounced  and proverbial. Philip's treatment of Mrs. Rowlandson must be declared  magnanimous, especially as, of course, he was but a savage king, who  might reasonably request us not to measure him by our rules. The other  party to the war we have a right to judge more rigidly, and just  sentence in their case must be severe. Philip's sorrowing, innocent wife  and son were brought prisoners to Plymouth, and their lot referred to  the ministers. After long deliberation and prayer it was decided that  they should be sold into slavery, and this was their fate.        CHAPTER III.    THE SALEM WITCHCRAFT    [1675]    The home life of colonial New England was unique. Its like has appeared  nowhere else in human history. Mostwise it was beautiful as well. In it  religion was central and supreme. The General Court of Plymouth very  early passed the following order: \"Noe dwelling-howse shal be builte  above halfe a myle from the meeting-howse in any newe plantacion without  leave from the Court, except mylle-howses and ffermehowses.\" In laying  out a village the meeting-house, as the hub to which everything was to  be referred, was located first of all. The minister's lot commonly  adjoined. Then a sufficiency of land was parcelled off to each  freeholder whereon to erect his dwelling. Massachusetts from the first,  and Plymouth beginning somewhat later, also made eminent provision for  schools--all in the interest of religion.    The earliest residences were necessarily of logs, shaped and fitted more  or less rudely according to the skill of the builder or the time and  means at his disposal. There was usually one large room below, which  served as kitchen, dining-room, sitting-room, and parlor, and on the  same floor with this one or two lodging-rooms. An unfinished attic  constituted the dormitory for the rising generation. A huge stone  chimney, terminating below in a still more capacious fireplace, that  would admit logs from four to eight feet in length, conveyed away the  smoke, and with it much of the heat. This involved no loss, as wood was  a drug. Communicating with the chimney was the great stone baking-oven,  whence came the bouncing loaves of corn-bread, duly \"brown,\" the  rich-colored \"pompion\" pies, and the loin of venison, beef, or pork.    Over these bounties--and such they were heartily esteemed, however  meagre--often as the family drew around the table, its head offered  thanks to the heavenly Giver. Each morning, after they had eaten, he  read a goodly portion of God's Word, never less than a chapter, and  then, not kneeling but standing, led his household in reverent and  believing prayer for protection, guidance, stimulus in good, and for  every needed grace. What purity, what love of rectitude, what strength  of will did not the builders of America carry forth from that family  altar! He who would understand the richest side and the deepest moving  forces of our national life and development must not overlook those New  England fireside scenes.    [1688-1700]    Prayers ended, the \"men folks\" went forth to the day's toil. It was  hard, partly from its then rough character, partly from poverty of  appliances. For the hardest jobs neighbors would join hands, fighting  nature as they had to fight the Indians, unitedly. Farming tools, if of  iron or steel, as axe, mattock, spade, and the iron nose for the digger  or the plough, the village blacksmith usually fashioned, as he did the  bake-pan, griddle, crane, and pothooks, for indoor use. Tables, chairs,  cradles, bedsteads, and those straight-backed \"settles\" of which a few  may yet be seen, were either home-made or gotten up by the village  carpenter. Mattresses were at first of hay, straw, leaves, or rushes.  Before 1700, however, feather beds were common, and houses and the  entire state of a New England farmer's home had become somewhat more  lordly than the above picture might indicate. The colonists made much  use of berries, wild fruits, bread and milk, game, fish, and shellfish.  The stock wandered in the forests and about the brooks, to be brought  home at night by the boys, whom the sound of the cow-bell led. In autumn  bushels upon bushels of nuts were laid by, to serve, along with dried  berries and grapes, salted fish and venison, as food for the winter.  Every phase and circumstance of this pioneer life reminded our fathers  of their dependence upon nature and the Supreme Power behind nature,  while at the same time the continual need and application of neighbor's  co-operation with neighbor brought out brotherly love in charming  strength and beauty.    But to old New England religion, as a clerical, public, and organized  affair, there is a far darker side. In the eighteenth century belief in  witchcraft was nearly universal. In 1683 one Margaret Matron was tried  in Pennsylvania on a charge of bewitching cows and geese, and placed  under bonds of one hundred pounds for good behavior. In 1705 Grace  Sherwood was ducked in Virginia for the same offence. Cases of the kind  had occurred in New York. There was no colony where the belief in  astrology, necromancy, second sight, ghosts, haunted houses and spots,  love-spells, charms, and peculiar powers attaching to rings, herbs,  etc., did not prevail. Such credulity was not peculiar to America, but  cursed Europe as well. It seemed to flourish, if anything, after the  Reformation more than before. Luther firmly believed in witchcraft. He  professed to have met the Evil One in personal conflict, and to have  vanquished him by the use of an inkstand as missile. Perhaps every land  in Europe had laws making witchcraft a capital crime. One was enacted in  England under Henry VIII., another in James I.'s first year, denouncing  death against all persons \"invoking any evil spirit, or consulting,  covenanting with, entertaining, employing, feeding, or rewarding any  evil spirit, or taking up dead bodies from their graves to be used in  any witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment, or killing or otherwise  hurting any person by such infernal arts.\" A similar statute was  contained in the \"Fundamentals\" of Massachusetts, probably inspired by  the command of Scripture, \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" This  law, we shall see, was not a dead letter.    No wonder such a law was of more effect in New England than anywhere  else on earth. The official religion of the Puritans was not only  superstitious in general but gloomy in particular, and most gloomy in  New England. Its central tenet, here at least, seemed to be that life  ought to furnish no joy, men seeking to \"merit heaven by making earth a  hell.\" Sunday laws were severe, and rigidly enforced from six o'clock  Saturday evening till the same hour the next. Not the least work was  allowed unless absolutely necessary, nor any semblance of amusement.  Boys bringing home the cows were cautioned to \"let down the bars softly,  as it was the Lord's day.\" Sunday travellers were arrested and fined.  Men might be whipped for absence from church. A girl at Plymouth was  threatened exile as a street-walker for smiling in meeting. Increase  Mather traced the great Boston fire of 1711 to the sin of Sunday labor,  such as carrying parcels and baking food. In Newport, some men having  been drowned who, to say good-by to departing friends, had rowed out to  a ship just weighing anchor, Rev. John Comer prayed that others might  take warning and \"do no more such great wickedness.\"    Sermons were often two hours long; public prayer half an hour. Worse  still was what went by the name of music--doggerel hymns full of the  most sulphurous theology, uttered congregationally as \"lined off\" by the  leader--nasal, dissonant, and discordant in the highest imaginable  degree. The church itself was but a barn, homely-shaped, bare, and in  winter cold as out-of-doors. At this season men wrapped their feet in  bags, and women stuffed their muffs with hot stones. Sleepers were  rudely awakened by the tithing-man's baton thwacking their heads; or, if  females, by its fox-tail end brushing their cheeks. Fast-days were  common. Prayer opened every public meeting, secular as well as  religious. The doctrine of special providences was pressed to a  ridiculous extreme. The devil was believed in no less firmly than God,  and indefinitely great power ascribed to him. The Catechism--book second  in authority only to the Bible--contained of his Satanic Majesty a cut,  which children were left, not to say taught, to suppose as correct a  likeness as that of Cromwell, which crowned the mantels of so many  homes.    [Illustration: Increase Mather.]    In a people thus trained the miracle is not that witchcraft and  superstition did so much mischief, but so little. Had it not"]]]
