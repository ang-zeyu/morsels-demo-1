The attempt of Mohammed  to lay down, with circumstantial minuteness, the position of the female  sex, the veiling of her person, and her withdrawal from the gaze of man,  has resulted in seclusion and degradation; while the spirit of the  Gospel, and injunctions like that of \"giving honor to the wife as to the  weaker vessel,\"[n] have borne the fruit of woman's elevation, and have  raised her to the position of influence, honor, and equality which  (notwithstanding the marital superiority of the husband in the ideal of  a Christian family) she now occupies in the social scale.    [Sidenote: Relations with the State.  Christianity leaves humanity free to expand.]  In the type of Mussulman government which (though not laid down in the  Koran) is founded upon the spirit of the faith and the precedent of the  Prophet the civil is indissolubly blended with the spiritual authority,  to the detriment of religious liberty and political progress. The  _Ameer_, or commander of the faithful, should, as in the early times, so  also in all ages, be the _Imam_, or religious chief; and as such he  should preside at the weekly cathedral service. It is not a case of the  Church being subject to the State, or the State being subject to the  Church. Here (as we used to see in the papal domains) the Church is the  State, and the State the Church. They both are one. And in this we have  another cause of the backwardness and depression of Mohammedan society.  Since the abolition of the temporal power in Italy we have nowhere in  Christian lands any such theocratic union of Caesar and the Church, so  that secular and religious advance is left more or less unhampered;  whereas in Islam the hierarchico-political constitution has hopelessly  welded the secular arm with the spiritual in one common scepter, to the  furthering of despotism, and elimination of the popular voice from its  proper place in the concerns of State.    [Sidenote: The Koran checks progress.]  And so, throughout the whole range of political, religious, social, and  domestic relations, the attempt made by the founder of Islam to provide  for all contingencies, and to fix every thing aforehand by rigid rule  and scale, has availed to cramp and benumb the free activities of life  and to paralyze the natural efforts of society at healthy growth,  expansion, and reform. As an author already quoted has so well put it,  \"_The Koran has frozen Mohammedan thought; to obey it is to abandon  progress_.\"[79]    [Sidenote: Is Islam suitable for any nation?]  Writers have indeed been found who, dwelling upon the benefits conferred  by Islam on idolatrous and savage nations, have gone so far as to hold  that the religion of Mohammed may in consequence be suited to certain  portions of mankind--as if the faith of Jesus might peaceably divide  with it the world. But surely to acquiesce in a system which reduces the  people to a dead level of social depression, despotism, and  semi-barbarism would be abhorrent from the first principles of  philanthropy. With the believer, who holds the Gospel to be \"good  tidings of great joy, _which shall be to all people_,\"[o] such a notion is  on higher grounds untenable; but even in view of purely secular  considerations it is not only untenable, but altogether unintelligible.  As I have said elsewhere:         The eclipse in the East, which still sheds its blight on the       ancient seats of Jerome and Chrysostom, and shrouds in darkness the       once bright and famous sees of Cyprian and Augustine, has been       disastrous every-where to liberty and progress, equally as it has       been to Christianity. And it is only as that eclipse shall pass       away and the Sun of righteousness again shine forth that we can       look to the nations now dominated by Islam sharing with us those       secondary but precious fruits of divine teaching. Then with the       higher and enduring blessings which our faith bestows, but not till       then, we may hope that there will follow likewise in their wake       freedom and progress, and all that tends to elevate the human       race.[80]    [Sidenote: No sacrifice for sin or redemptive grace.]  Although with the view of placing the argument on independent ground I  have refrained from touching the peculiar doctrines of Christianity, and  the inestimable benefits which flow to mankind therefrom, I may be  excused, before I conclude, if I add a word regarding them. The  followers of Mohammed have no knowledge of God as a _Father_; still less  have they knowledge of him as \"_Our_ Father\"--the God and Father of the  Lord Jesus Christ. They acknowledge, indeed, that Jesus was a true  prophet sent of God; but they deny his crucifixion and death, and they  know nothing of the power of his resurrection. To those who have found  redemption and peace in these the grand and distinctive truths of the  Christian faith, it may be allowed to mourn over the lands in which the  light of the Gospel has been quenched, and these blessings blotted out,  by the material forces of Islam; where, together with civilization and  liberty, Christianity has given place to gross darkness, and it is as if  now \"there were no more sacrifice for sins.\" We may, and we do, look  forward with earnest expectation to the day when knowledge of salvation  shall be given to these nations \"by the remission of their sins, through  the tender mercy of our God, whereby the Dayspring from on high hath  visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow  of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.\"[p]    [Sidenote: Contrast between divine and human work.]  But even apart from these, the special blessings of Christianity, I ask,  which now of the two faiths bears, in its birth and growth, the mark of  a divine hand and which the human stamp? Which looks likest the  handiwork of the God of nature, who \"hath laid the measures of the  earth,\" and \"hath stretched the line upon it,\"[q] but not the less with an  ever-varying adaptation to time and place? and which the artificial  imitation?         [Sidenote: Islam.]       \"As a reformer, Mohammed did indeed advance his people to a certain       point, but as a prophet he left them fixed immovably at that point       for all time to come. As there can be no return, so neither can       there be any progress. The tree is of artificial planting. Instead       of containing within itself the germ of growth and adaptation to       the various requirements of time, and clime, and circumstance,       expanding with the genial sunshine and the rain from heaven, it       remains the same forced and stunted thing as when first planted       twelve centuries ago.\"[81]    [Sidenote: Christianity compared by Christ to the works of nature.]  Such is Islam. Now what is Christianity? Listen to the prophetic words  of the Founder himself, who compares it to the works of nature:         \"_So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the       ground;_         \"_And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should       spring and grow up, he knoweth not how._         \"_For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself: first the blade,       then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear._\"[r]    And again:         \"_Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God, or with what       comparison shall we compare it?_         \"_It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which, when it is sown in the       earth, is less than all seeds that be in the earth;_         \"_But when it is sown, it groweth up and becometh greater than all       herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the fowls of the       air may lodge under the shadow of it._\"[s]    [Sidenote: Islam the work of man; Christianity the work of God.]  Which is _nature_, and which is _art_, let the reader judge. Which bears  the impress of man's hand, and which that of Him who \"is wonderful in  counsel, and excellent in working?\"    In fine, of the Arabian it may be said:         \"_Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and here shall thy       proud waves be stayed._\"    But of Christ:         \"_His name shall endure forever: his name shall be continued as       long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall       call him blessed._         \"_He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river       unto the ends of the earth._         \"_Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth       wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name forever: and let       the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen._\"[t]      FOOTNOTES:    [e] 1 Cor. vii, 21.    [f] Gal. iii, 26, 28.

A poor Brahmin, Gunga Sing,  came along the road with me, to seek redress for injuries sustained.  His grandfather was in the service of our Government, and killed  under Lord Lake, at the first siege of Bhurtpore in 1804. With the  little he left, the family had set up as agricultural capitalists in  the village of Poorwa Pundit, on the estate of Kulunder Buksh, of  Bhitwal. Here they prospered. The estate was, as a matter of favour  to Kulunder Buksh, transferred from the jurisdiction of the  contractor to that of the Hozoor Tehseel.*  Kulunder Buksh either  could not, or would not, pay the Government demand; and he employed  two of his relatives, Godree and Hoseyn Buksh, to plunder in the  estate and the neighbourhood, to reduce Government to his own terms.  These two persons, with two hundred armed men, attacked the village  in the night; and, after plundering the house of this Brahmin, Gunga  Sing, they seized his wife, who was then pregnant, and made her point  out a hidden treasure of one hundred and seven gold mohurs, and two  hundred and seventy-seven rupees. She had been wounded in several  places before she did this, and when she could point out no more, one  of the two brothers cut her down with his sword, and killed her. In  all the Brahmin lost two thousand seven hundred and fifty-five  rupees' worth of property; and, on the ground of his grandfather  having been killed in the Honourable Company's service, has been ever  since urging the Resident to interpose with the Oude government in  his behalf.    [* The term \"Hozoor Tehseel\" signifies the collections of the revenue  made by the governor himself whether of a district or a kingdom. The  estates of all landholders who pay their land-revenues direct to the  governor, or to the deputy employed under him to receive such  revenues and manage such estates, are said to be in the \"Hozoor  Tehseel.\" The local authorities of the districts on which such  estates are situated have nothing whatever to do with them.]    The estate of Bhitwal has been retransferred to the jurisdiction of  the Amil of Byswara, who has restored it to Kulunder Buksh; and his  two relatives, Godree and Hoseyn Buksh, are thriving on the booty  acquired, and are in high favour with the local authorities. I have  requested that measures may be adopted to punish them for the robbery  and the cruel murder of the poor woman; but have little hope that  they will be so. _No government in India is now more weak for  purposes of good than that of Oude_.    This village of Kinalee is now in the estate of Ramnuggur Dhumeereea,  held by Gorbuksh, a large landholder, who has a strong fort,  Bhitolee, at the point of the Delta, formed by the Chouka and Ghagra  rivers, which here unite. He has taken refuge with some four thousand  armed followers in this fort, under the apprehension of being made to  pay the full amount of the Government demand, and called to account  for the rescue of some atrocious offenders from Captain Hearsey, of  the Frontier Police, by whom they had been secured. Gorbuksh used to  pay two hundred thousand rupees a-year for many years for this  estate, without murmur or difficulty; but for the last three years he  has not paid the rate, to which he has got it reduced, of one hundred  and fifty thousand. Out of his rents and the revenues due to  Government he keeps up a large body of armed followers, to intimidate  the Government, and seize upon the estates of his weaker neighbours,  many of which he has lately appropriated by fraud, violence, and  collusion. An attempt was this year made to put the estate under the  management of Government officers; but he was too strong for the  Government, which was obliged to temporise, and at last to yield. He  is said to exact from the landholders the sum of two hundred and  fifty thousand rupees a-year. He holds also the estate of Bhitolee,  at the apex of the delta of the Ghagra and Chouka rivers, in which  the fort of Bhitolee is situated. The Government demand on this  estate is fifty thousand (50,000) rupees a-year. His son, Surubjeet  Sing, is engaged in plunder, and, it is said, with his father's  connivance and encouragement, though he pretends to be acting in  disobedience of his orders. The object is, to augment their estate,  and intimidate the Government and its officers by gangs of ruffians,  whom they can maintain only by plunder and malversation. The greater  part of the lands, comprised in this estate of Ramnuggur Dhumeereea,  of which Rajah Gorbuksh is now the local governor, are hereditary  possessions which have been held by his family for many generations.  A part has been recently seized from weaker neighbours, and added to  them. The rest are merely under him as the governor or public  officer, intrusted with the collection of the revenue and the  management of the police.    _December_ 4, 1849.--Gunesh Gunge, _alias_ Byram-ghat, on the right  bank of the river Ghagra, distance about twelve miles. The country  well cultivated, and studded with good groves of mango and other  trees. We passed through and close to several villages, whose houses  are nothing but mud walls, without a thatched or tiled roof to one in  twenty. The people say there is no security in them from the King's  troops and the passies, a large class of men in Oude, who are village  watchmen but inveterate thieves and robbers, when not employed as  such. All refractory landholders hire a body of passies to fight for  them, as they pay themselves out of the plunder, and cost little to  their employers. They are all armed with bows and arrows, and are  very formidable at night. They and their refractory employers keep  the country in a perpetual state of disorder; and, though they do not  prevent the cultivation of the land, they prevent the village and  hamlets from being occupied by anybody who has anything to lose, and  no strong local ties to restrain him.    The town of Ramnuggur, in which Gorbuksh resides occasionally, is on  the road some five miles from the river. It has a good many houses,  but all are of the same wretched description; mud walls, with  invisible coverings or no coverings at all; no signs of domestic  peace or happiness; but nothing can exceed the richness and variety  of the crops in and around Ramnuggur. It is a fine garden, and would  soon be beautiful, were life and property better secured, and some  signs of domestic comfort created. The ruined state of the houses in  this town and in the villages along the road, is, in part, owing to  the system which requires all the King's troops to forage for  themselves on the march, and the contractors, and other collectors of  revenue, to be continually on the move, and to take all their troops  with them. The troops required in the provinces should be cantoned in  five or six places most convenient, with regard, to the districts to  be controlled, and most healthy for the people; and provided with  what they require, as ours are, and sent out to assist the revenue  collectors and magistrates only when their services are indispensably  necessary. Some Chundele Rajpoot landholders came to me yesterday to  say, that Ghoolam Huzrut, with his bands of armed ruffians, seemed  determined to seize upon all the estates of his weaker Hindoo  neighbours, and they would soon lose theirs, unless the British  Government interposed to protect them. Gorbuksh has not ventured to  come, as he was ordered, to pay his respects to the Resident; but has  shut himself up in his fort at Bhitolee, about six miles up the river  from our camp. The Chouka is a small river which there flows into the  Ghagra. He is said to have four or five thousand men with him; and  several guns mounted in his fort. The ferry over the Ghagra is close  to our tents, and called Byram-ghat.    _December_ 5, 1849.--Crossed the river Ghagra, in boats, and encamped  at Nawabgunge, on the left bank, where we were met by one of the  collectors of the Gonda Bahraetch district. He complained of the  difficulties experienced in realizing the just demands of the  exchequer, from the number and power of the tallookdars of the  district, who had forts and bands of armed followers, too strong for  the King's officers. There were, he said, in the small purgunnah of  Gouras--    1.--Pretheeput Sing, of Paska, who has a strong fort called Dhunolee,  on the right bank of the Ghagra, opposite to Paska and Bumhoree, two  strongholds, which he has on the left bank of that river, and he is  always ready to resist the Government.    2.--Murtonjee Buksh, of Shahpoor, who is always ready to do the same;  and a great ruffian.    3.--Shere Bahader Sing, of Kuneear.*    4.--Maheput Sing, of Dhunawa.*    5.--Surnam Sing, of Arta.*    6.--Maheput Sing, of Paruspoor.*    [* All four are at present on good terms with the Government and its  local authorities.]    They have each a fort, or stronghold, mounting five or six guns, and  trained bands of armed and brave men of five or six hundred, which  they augment, as occasion requires, by Gohars, or auxiliary bands  from their friends.    Hurdut Sing, of Bondee, _alias_ Bumnootee, held an estate for which  he paid one hundred and eighty-two thousand (1,82,000) rupees a year  to Government; but he was driven, out of it in 1846-47, by Rughbur  Sing, the contractor, who, by rapacity and outrage, drove off the  greater part of the cultivators, and so desolated the estate that it  could not now be made to yield thirty thousand (30,000) rupees a-  year. The Raja has ever since resided with a few followers in an  island in the Ghagra. He has never openly resisted or defied the  Government, but is said to be sullen, and a bad paymaster. He still  holds "]]]
