Lauderdale, Crawford, and  Sir Robert Murray, among others, were incapacitated: but the king, who  disapproved of this injustice, refused his assent.[*]    An act was passed against all persons who should move the king for  restoring the children of those who were attainted by parliament; an  unheard-of restraint on applications for grace and mercy. No penalty  was affixed; but the act was but the more violent and tyrannical on  that account. The court lawyers had established it as a maxim, that the  assigning of a punishment was a limitation of the crown; whereas a  law forbidding any thing, though without a penalty, made the offenders  criminal. And in that case, they determined that the punishment  was arbitrary; only that it could not extend to life. Middleton, as  commissioner, passed this act; though he had no instructions for that  purpose.    An act of indemnity passed; but at the same time it was voted, that all  those who had offended during the late disorders, should be subjected  to fines; and a committee of parliament was appointed for imposing them.  These proceeded without any regard to some equitable rules which the  king had prescribed to them.[*] The most obnoxious compounded secretly.         * Burnet, p. 152.         ** Burnet, p. 147.    No consideration was had, either of men's riches, or of the degrees  of their guilt: no proofs were produced: inquiries were not so much as  made: but as fast as information was given in against any man, he was  marked down for a particular fine: and all was transacted in a secret  committee. When the list was read in parliament, exceptions were made  to several: some had been under age during the civil wars; some had been  abroad. But it was still replied, that a proper time would come when  every man should be heard in his own defence. The only intention, it was  said, of setting the fines was, that such persons should have no benefit  by the act of indemnity, unless they paid the sum demanded: every one  that chose to stand upon his innocence, and renounce the benefit of  the indemnity, might do it at his peril. It was well known, that no one  would dare so far to set at defiance so arbitrary an administration.  The king wrote to the council, ordering them to supersede the levying of  those fines: but Middleton found means, during some time, to elude these  orders.[*] And at last, the king obliged his ministers to compound for  half the sums which had been imposed. In all these transactions, and  in most others which passed during the present reign, we still find the  moderating hand of the king interposed to protect the Scots from the  oppressions which their own countrymen, employed in the ministry, were  desirous of exercising over them.         * Burnet, p. 201.    But the chief circumstance whence were derived all the subsequent  tyranny and disorders in Scotland, was the execution of the laws for the  establishment of Episcopacy; a mode of government to which a great part  of the nation had entertained an unsurmountable aversion. The rights  of patrons had for some years been abolished; and the power of electing  ministers had been vested in the kirk session and lay elders. It was  now enacted, that all incumbents who had been admitted upon this title,  should receive a presentation from the patron, and should be instituted  anew by the bishop, under the penalty of deprivation. The more  rigid Presbyterians concerted measures among themselves, and refused  obedience: they imagined that their number would protect them. Three  hundred and fifty parishes, above a third of the kingdom, were at once  declared vacant. The western counties chiefly were obstinate in this  particular. New ministers were sought for all over the kingdom; and no  one was so ignorant or vicious as to be rejected. The people, who loved  extremely and respected their former teachers; men remarkable for the  severity of their manners, and their fervor in preaching; were inflamed  against these intruders, who had obtained their livings under such  invidious circumstances, and who took no care, by the regularity of  their manners, to soften the prejudices entertained against them. Even  most of those who retained their livings by compliance, fell under the  imputation of hypocrisy, either by their showing a disgust to the new  model of ecclesiastical government which they had acknowledged; or, on  the other hand, by declaring, that their former adherence to Presbytery  and the covenant had been the result of violence and necessity. And as  Middleton and the new ministry indulged themselves in great riot and  disorder, to which the nation had been little accustomed, an opinion  universally prevailed, that any form of religion, offered by such hands,  must be profane and impious.    The people, notwithstanding their discontents, were resolved to give  no handle against them, by the least symptom of mutiny or sedition: but  this submissive disposition, instead of procuring a mitigation of the  rigors, was made use of as an argument for continuing the same measures,  which, by their vigor, it was pretended, had produced so prompt an  obedience. The king, however, was disgusted with the violence of  Middleton;[*] and he made Rothes commissioner in his place. This  nobleman was already president of the council; and soon after was made  lord keeper and treasurer. Lauderdale still continued secretary of  state, and commonly resided at London.    Affairs remained in a peaceable state, till the severe law was made in  England against conventicles.[**] The Scottish parliament imitated that  violence, by passing a like act. A kind of high commission court was  appointed by the privy council, for executing this rigorous law, and for  the direction of ecclesiastical affairs. But even this court, illegal  as it might be deemed, was much preferable to the method next adopted.  Military force was let loose by the council. Wherever the people had  generally forsaken their churches, the guards were quartered throughout  the country. Sir James Turner commanded them, a man whose natural  ferocity of temper was often inflamed by the use of strong liquors. He  went about, and received from the clergy lists of those who absented  themselves from church, or were supposed to frequent conventicles.  Without any proof or legal conviction, he demanded a fine from them,  and quartered soldiers on the supposed delinquents, till he received  payment. As an insurrection was dreaded during the Dutch war, new forces  were levied, and intrusted to the command, of Dalziel and Drummond;  two officers who had served the king during the civil wars, and had  afterwards engaged in the service of Russia, where they had increased  the native cruelty of their disposition. A full career was given to  their tyranny by the Scottish ministry. Representations were made to the  king against these enormities. He seemed touched with the state of the  country; and besides giving orders that the ecclesiastical commission  should be discontinued, he signified his opinion, that another way of  proceeding was necessary for his service.[***]         * Burnet, p 202.         ** 1664.         *** Burnet, p. 213    This lenity of the king's came too late to remedy the disorders. The  people, inflamed with bigotry, and irritated by ill usage, rose in  arms. They were instigated by Guthry, Semple, and other preachers. They  surprised Turner in Dumfries, and resolved to have put him to death; but  finding that his orders, which fell into their hands, were more violent  than his execution of them, they spared his life. At Laneric, after many  prayers, they renewed the covenant, and published their manifesto; in  which they professed all submission to the king: they desired only the  reestablishment of Presbytery, and of their former ministers. As many  gentlemen of their party had been confined on suspicion, Wallace  and Learmont, two officers who had served, but in no high rank, were  intrusted by the populace with the command. Their force never exceeded  two thousand men; and though the country in general bore them favor,  men's spirits were so subdued, that the rebels could expect no further  accession of numbers. Dalziel took the field to oppose their progress.  Their number was now diminished to eight hundred; and these, having  advanced near Edinburgh, attempted to find their way back into the west  by Pentland Hills. They were attacked by the king's forces.[*] Finding  that they could not escape, they stopped their march. Their clergy  endeavored to infuse courage into them. After singing some psalms, the  rebels turned on the enemy; and being assisted by the advantage of the  ground, they received the first charge very resolutely. But that was  all the action: immediately they fell into disorder, and fled for their  lives. About forty were killed on the spot, and a hundred and thirty  taken prisoners. The rest, favored by the night, and by the weariness,  and even by the pity of the king's troops, made their escape.         * November 28, 1666.    The oppressions which these people had suffered, the delusions  under which they labored, and their inoffensive behavior during the  insurrection, made them the objects of compassion: yet were the king's  ministers, particularly Sharpe, resolved to take severe vengeance. Ten  were hanged on one gibbet at Edinburgh; thirty-five before their own  doors in different places. These criminals might all have saved their  lives, if they would have renounced the covenant. The executions were  going on, when the king put a stop to them. He said, that blood enough  had already been shed; and he wrote a letter to the privy council, in  which he ordered, that such of the prisoners as should simply promise  to obey the laws for the future, should be set at liberty, and that  the incorrigible should be sent to the plantations.[*] This letter was  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#18)"],[1," rode along the line to show himself to the  army after this narrow escape. At night he called a council of war, and  declared his resolution to attack the enemy in the morning. Schomberg  at first opposed his design; but finding the king determined, he advised  that a strong detachment of horse and foot should that night pass the  Boyne at Slane-bridge, and take post between the enemy and the pass of  Duleck, that the action might be the more decisive. This council  being rejected, the king determined that early in the morning  lieutenant-general Douglas, with the right wing of infantry, and young  Schomberg, with the horse, should pass at Slane-bridge, while the main  body of foot should force their passage at Old-bridge, and the left  at certain fords between the enemy's camp and Drogheda. The duke,  perceiving his advice was not relished by the Dutch generals, retired to  his tent, where the order of battle being brought to him, he received it  with an air of discontent, saying, It was the first that had ever been  sent him in that manner. The proper dispositions being made, William  rode quite through the army by torchlight, and then retired to his tent,  after having given orders for the soldiers to distinguish themselves  from the enemy by wearing green boughs in their hats during the action.          BATTLE OF THE BOYNE.    At six o'clock in the morning, general Douglas, with young Schomberg,  the earl of Portland, and Auverquerque, marched towards Slane-bridge,  and passed the river with very little opposition. When they reached  the farther bank, they perceived the enemy drawn up in two lines, to a  considerable number of horse and foot, with a morass in their front,  so that Douglas was obliged to wait for a reinforcement. This being  arrived, the infantry was led on to the charge through the morass, while  count Schomberg rode round it with his cavalry to attack the enemy  in flank. The Irish, instead of waiting the assault, faced about and  retreated towards Duleck with some precipitation; yet not so fast but  that Schomberg fell in among their rear and did considerable execution.  King James however soon reinforced his left wing from the centre;  and the count was in his turn obliged to send for assistance. At this  juncture, king William's main body, consisting of the Dutch guards,  the French regiments, and some battalions of English, passed the river,  which was waist high, under a general discharge of artillery. King  James had imprudently removed his cannon from the other side; but he  had posted a strong body of musqueteers along the bank, behind hedges,  houses, and some works raised for the occasion. These poured in a close  fire upon the English troops before they reached the shore; but  it produced very little effect: then the Irish gave way; and some  battalions landed without further opposition. Yet, before they could  form, they were charged with great impetuosity by a squadron of the  enemy's horse; and a considerable body of their cavalry and foot,  commanded by general Hamilton, advanced from behind some little hillocks  to attack those that were landed, as well as to prevent the rest  from reaching the shore. His infantry turned their backs and fled  immediately; but the horse charged with incredible fury, both upon the  bank and in the river, so as to put the unformed regiments in confusion.  Then the duke of Schomberg, passing the river in person, put himself  at the head of the French protestants, and pointing to the enemy,  \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"those are your persecutors;\" with these words he  advanced to the attack, where he himself sustained a violent onset from  a party of the Irish horse which had broke through one of the regiments,  and were now on their return. They were mistaken for English, and  allowed to gallop up to the duke, who received two severe wounds in  the head; but the French regiments being now sensible of their mistake,  rashly threw in their fire upon the Irish while they were engaged with  the duke, and instead of saving, shot him dead upon the spot. The fate  of this general had well nigh proved fatal to the English army, which  was immediately involved in tumult and disorder; while the infantry  of king James rallied, and returned to their posts with a face of  resolution. They were just ready to fall upon the centre, when king  William having passed with the left wing, composed of the Danish, Dutch,  and Inniskilling horse, advanced to attack them on the right. They were  struck with such a panic at his appearance that they made a sudden halt,  and then facing about, retreated to the village of Dunore. There they  made such a vigorous stand that the Dutch and Danish horse, though  headed by the king in person, recoiled; even the Inniskillmers gave  way; and the whole wing would have been routed, had not a detachment  of dragoons, belonging to the regiment of Cunningham and Livison,  dismounted, and lined the hedges on each side of the defile through  which the fugitives were driven. There they did such execution upon the  pursuers as soon checked their ardour. The horse, which were broken, had  now time to rally, and returning to the charge, drove the enemy before  them in their turn. In this action general Hamilton, who had been the  life and soul of the Irish during the whole engagement, was wounded and  taken--an incident which discouraged them to such a degree, that they  made no further efforts to retrieve the advantage they had lost. He was  immediately brought to the king, who asked him if he thought the Irish  would make any further resistance; and he replied, \"Upon my honour, I  believe they will; for they have still a good body of horse entire.\"  William, eyeing him with a look of disdain, repeated, \"Your honour! your  honour!\" but took no other notice of his having acted contrary to  his engagement, when he was permitted to go to Ireland on promise of  persuading Tyrconnel to submit to the new government. The Irish now  abandoned the field with precipitation; but the French and Swiss troops,  that acted as their auxiliaries under Lausun, retreated in good order,  after having maintained the battle for some time with intrepidity and  perseverance.          DEATH OF SCHOMBERG.    As king William did not think proper to pursue the enemy, the carnage  was not great. The Irish lost fifteen hundred men, and the English  about one-third of that number; though the victory was dearly purchased,  considering the death of the gallant duke of Schomberg, who fell in the  eighty-second year of his age, after having rivalled the best generals  of the time in military reputation. He was descended of a noble family  in the Palatinate, and his mother was an English woman, daughter of lord  Dudley. Being obliged to leave his country on account of the troubles  by which it was agitated, he commenced a soldier of fortune, and served  successively in the armies of Holland, England, France, Portugal, and  Brandenburgh. He attained to the dignities of mareschal in France,  grandee in Portugal, generalissimo in Prussia, and duke in England.  He professed the protestant religion; was courteous and humble in his  deportment; cool, penetrating, resolute, and sagacious; nor was his  probity inferior to his courage. This battle likewise proved fatal  to the brave Caillemote, who had followed the duke's fortunes, and  commanded one of the protestant regiments. After having received a  mortal wound, he was carried back through the river by four soldiers,  and though almost in the agonies of death, he with a cheerful  countenance encouraged those who were crossing to do their duty,  exclaiming, \"_A la gloire, mes enfans; a la gloire_. To glory, my  lads; to glory!\" The third remarkable person who lost his life on  this occasion was Walker the clergyman, who had so valiantly defended  Londonderry against the whole army of king James. He had been very  graciously received by king William, who gratified him with a reward of  five thousand pounds, and a promise of further favour; but his military  genius still predominating, he attended his royal patron in this battle,  and being shot in the belly, died in a few minutes. The persons of  distinction who fell on the other side were the lords Dongan and  Carlingford, sir Neile O'Neile, and the marquis of Hoequincourt. James  himself stood aloof during the action on the hill of Dunmore, surrounded  with some squadrons of horse; and seeing victory declare against him,  retired to Dublin without having made the least effort to re-assemble  his broken forces. Had he possessed either spirit or conduct, his army  might have been rallied, and reinforced from his garrisons, so as to be  in a condition to keep the field, and even act upon the offensive; for  his loss was inconsiderable, and the victor did not attempt to molest  his troops in their retreat--an omission which has been charged upon him  as a flagrant instance of misconduct. Indeed, through the whole of this  engagement, William's personal courage was much more conspicuous than  his military skill.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          JAMES EMBARKS FOR FRANCE.    King James no sooner arrived at Dublin than he assembled the magistrates  and council of the city, and in a short speech resigned them to the  fortune of the victor. He complained of the cowardice of the Irish;  signified his resolution of leaving the kingdom immediately; forbade  them, on their allegiance, to burn or plunder the city after his  departure; and assured them, that, though he was obliged to yield to  force, he would never cease to labour for their deliverance. Next day he  set out for Waterford, attended by the duke of Berwick, Tyrconnel,  and the marquis of Powis. He ordered all the bridges to be broken down  behind him, and embarked in a vessel which had been prepared for his  reception. At sea he fell in with the French squadron, commanded by the  Sieur de Foran, who persuaded him to go"]]]
