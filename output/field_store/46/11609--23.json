Then, in the third place, having recovered some wholesome habits of  life as to food and dress, we must recover them as to lodging. I said  just now that the best architecture was but a glorified roof. Think of  it. The dome of the Vatican, the porches of Rheims or Chartres, the  vaults and arches of their aisles, the canopy of the tomb, and the spire  of the belfry, are all forms resulting from the mere requirement that a  certain space shall be strongly covered from heat and rain. More than  that--as I have tried all through \"The Stories of Venice\" to show,--the  lovely forms of these were every one of them developed in civil and  domestic building, and only after their invention, employed  ecclesiastically on the grandest scale. I think you cannot but have  noticed here in Oxford, as elsewhere, that our modern architects never  seem to know what to do with their roofs. Be assured, until the roofs  are right, nothing else will be; and there are just two ways of keeping  them right. Never build them of iron, but only of wood or stone; and  secondly, take care that in every town the little roofs are built before  the large ones, and that everybody who wants one has got one. And we  must try also to make everybody want one. That is to say, at some not  very advanced period of life, men should desire to have a home, which  they do not wish to quit any more, suited to their habits of life, and  likely to be more and more suitable to them until their death. And men  must desire to have these their dwelling-places built as strongly as  possible, and furnished and decorated daintily, and set in pleasant  places, in bright light, and good air, being able to choose for  themselves that at least as well as swallows. And when the houses are  grouped together in cities, men must have so much civic fellowship as to  subject their architecture to a common law, and so much civic pride as  to desire that the whole gathered group of human dwellings should be a  lovely thing, not a frightful one, on the face of the earth. Not many  weeks ago an English clergyman,[11] a master of this University, a man  not given to sentiment, but of middle age, and great practical sense,  told me, by accident, and wholly without reference to the subject now  before us, that he never could enter London from his country parsonage  but with closed eyes, lest the sight of the blocks of houses which the  railroad intersected in the suburbs should unfit him, by the horror of  it, for his day's work.    [Footnote 11: Osborne Gordon.]      123. Now, it is not possible--and I repeat to you, only in more  deliberate assertion, what I wrote just twenty-two years ago in the last  chapter of the \"Seven Lamps of Architecture\"--it is not possible to have  any right morality, happiness, or art, in any country where the cities  are thus built, or thus, let me rather say, clotted and coagulated;  spots of a dreadful mildew, spreading by patches and blotches over the  country they consume. You must have lovely cities, crystallised, not  coagulated, into form; limited in size, and not casting out the scum and  scurf of them into an encircling eruption of shame, but girded each with  its sacred pomoerium, and with garlands of gardens full of blossoming  trees and softly guided streams.    That is impossible, you say! it may be so. I have nothing to do with its  possibility, but only with its indispensability. More than that must be  possible, however, before you can have a school of art; namely, that you  find places elsewhere than in England, or at least in otherwise  unserviceable parts of England, for the establishment of manufactories  needing the help of fire, that is to say, of all the +technai  banausikai+ and +epirretoi+, of which it was long ago known to be  the constant nature that \"+ascholias malista echousi kai philon  kai poleos sunepimeleisthai+,\" and to reduce such manufactures to their  lowest limit, so that nothing may ever be made of iron that can as  effectually be made of wood or stone; and nothing moved by steam that  can be as effectually moved by natural forces. And observe, that for all  mechanical effort required in social life and in cities, water power is  infinitely more than enough; for anchored mills on the large rivers, and  mills moved by sluices from reservoirs filled by the tide, will give you  command of any quantity of constant motive power you need.    Agriculture by the hand, then, and absolute refusal or banishment of  unnecessary igneous force, are the first conditions of a school of art  in any country. And until you do this, be it soon or late, things will  continue in that triumphant state to which, for want of finer art, your  mechanism has brought them;--that, though England is deafened with  spinning wheels, her people have not clothes--though she is black with  digging of fuel, they die of cold--and though she has sold her soul for  gain, they die of hunger. Stay in that triumph, if you choose; but be  assured of this, it is not one which the fine arts will ever share with  you.      124. Now, I have given you my message, containing, as I know, offence  enough, and itself, it may seem to many, unnecessary enough. But just in  proportion to its apparent non-necessity, and to its certain offence,  was its real need, and my real duty to speak it. The study of the fine  arts could not be rightly associated with the grave work of English  Universities, without due and clear protest against the misdirection of  national energy, which for the present renders all good results of such  study on a great scale, impossible. I can easily teach you, as any other  moderately good draughtsman could, how to hold your pencils, and how to  lay your colours; but it is little use my doing that, while the nation  is spending millions of money in the destruction of all that pencil or  colour has to represent, and in the promotion of false forms of art,  which are only the costliest and the least enjoyable of follies. And  therefore these are the things that I have first and last to tell you in  this place;--that the fine arts are not to be learned by Locomotion, but  by making the homes we live in lovely, and by staying in them;--that  the fine arts are not to be learned by Competition, but by doing our  quiet best in our own way;--that the fine arts are not to be learned by  Exhibition, but by doing what is right, and making what is honest,  whether it be exhibited or not;--and, for the sum of all, that men must  paint and build neither for pride nor for money, but for love; for love  of their art, for love of their neighbour, and whatever better love may  be than these, founded on these. I know that I gave some pain, which I  was most unwilling to give, in speaking of the possible abuses of  religious art; but there can be no danger of any, so long as we remember  that God inhabits cottages as well as churches, and ought to be well  lodged there also. Begin with wooden floors; the tessellated ones will  take care of themselves; begin with thatching roofs, and you shall end  by splendidly vaulting them; begin by taking care that no old eyes fail  over their Bibles, nor young ones over their needles, for want of  rushlight, and then you may have whatever true good is to be got out of  coloured glass or wax candles. And in thus putting the arts to universal  use, you will find also their universal inspiration, their universal  benediction. I told you there was no evidence of a _special_ Divineness  in any application of them; that they were always equally human and  equally Divine; and in closing this inaugural series of lectures, into  which I have endeavoured to compress the principles that are to be the  foundations of your future work, it is my last duty to say some positive  words as to the Divinity of all art, when it is truly fair, or truly  serviceable.      125. Every seventh day, if not oftener, the greater number of  well-meaning persons in England thankfully receive from their teachers a  benediction, couched in those terms:--\"The grace of our Lord Jesus  Christ, and the Love of God, and the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be  with you.\" Now I do not know precisely what sense is attached in the  English public mind to those expressions. But what I have to tell you  positively is that the three things do actually exist, and can be known  if you care to know them, and possessed if you care to possess them;  and that another thing exists, besides these, of which we already know  too much.    First, by simply obeying the orders of the Founder of your religion, all  grace, graciousness, or beauty and favour of gentle life, will be given  to you in mind and body, in work and in rest. The Grace of Christ  exists, and can be had if you will. Secondly, as you know more and more  of the created world, you will find that the true will of its Maker is  that its creatures should be happy;--that He has made everything  beautiful in its time and its place, and that it is chiefly by the fault  of men, when they are allowed the liberty of thwarting His laws, that  Creation groans or travails in pain. The Love of God exists, and you may  see it, and live in it if you will. Lastly, a Spirit does actually exist  which teaches the ant her path, the bird her building, and men, in an  instinctive and marvellous way, whatever lovely arts and noble deeds are  possible to them. Without it you can do no good thing. To the grief of  it you can do many bad ones. In the possession of it is your peace and  your power.    And there is a fourth thing, of which we already know too much. There is  an evil spirit whose dominion is in blindness and in cowardice, as the  dominion of the Spirit of wisdom is in clear sight and in courage.    And this blind and cowardly spirit is for ever telling you that evil  things are pardonable, and you shall not die for them, and that good  things are impossible, and you need not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#18)"],[1,"they came to a clear-running stream  he emptied the water bottle, dipped up a little fresh water, added  brandy, and lifted Brit's head very gently and gave him a drink. Brit  opened his eyes and looked at Swan, and from him to Lorraine, but he did  not say anything. He still had that tightened look around his mouth  which spelled pain.    \"Pretty quick now we get you fixed up good,\" Swan told him cheerfully.  \"One mile more is all, and we get the horses and I make a good bed for  you.\" He looked a signal, and Lorraine once more took up the stretcher.    Another mile seemed a long way, light though Swan had made the load for  her. She thought once that he must have some clairvoyant power, because  whenever she felt as if her arms were breaking, Swan would tell her to  stop a minute.    \"How do you know a doctor will come?\" she asked Swan suddenly, when they  were resting with the Thurman ranch in view half a mile below them.    Swan did not look at her directly, as had been his custom. She saw a  darker shade of red creep up into his cheeks. \"My mother says she would  send a doctor quick,\" he replied hesitatingly. \"You will see. It is  because--your father he is not like other men in this country. Your  father is a good man. That is why a doctor comes.\"    Lorraine looked at him strangely and stooped again to her burden. She  did not speak again until they were passing the Thurman fence where it  ran up into the mouth of the canyon. A few horses were grazing there,  the sun striking their sides with the sheen of satin. They stared  curiously at the little procession, snorted and started to run, heads  and tails held high. But one wheeled suddenly and came galloping toward  them, stopped when he was quite close, ducked and went thundering past  to the head of the field. Lorraine gave a sharp little scream and set  down the stretcher with a lurch, staring after the horse wide-eyed, her  face white.    \"They do it for play,\" Swan said reassuringly. \"They don't hurt you. The  fence is between, and they don't hurt you anyway.\"    \"That horse with the white face--I saw it--and when the man struck it  with his quirt it went past me, running like that and dragging--_oh-h_!\"  She leaned against the bluff side, her face covered with her two palms.    Swan glanced down at Brit, saw that his eyes were closed, ducked his  head from under the looped rope and went to Lorraine.    \"The man that struck that horse--do you know that man?\" he asked, all  the good nature gone from his voice.    \"No--I don't know--I saw him twice, by the lightning flashes. He  shot--and then I saw him----\" She stopped abruptly, stood for a minute  longer with her eyes covered, then dropped her hands limply to her  sides. But when the horse came circling back with a great flourish, she  shivered and her hands closed into the fists of a fighter.    \"Are you a Sawtooth man?\" she demanded suddenly, looking up at Swan  defiantly. \"It was a nightmare. I--I dreamed once about a horse--like  that.\"    Swan's wide-open eyes softened a little. \"The Sawtooth calls me that  damn Swede on Bear Top,\" he explained. \"I took a homestead up there and  some day they will want to buy my place or they will want to make a  fight with me to get the water. Could you know that man again?\"    \"Raine!\" Brit's voice held a warning, and Lorraine shivered again as she  turned toward him. \"Raine, you----\"    He closed his eyes again, and she could get no further speech from him.  But she thought she understood. He did not want her to talk about Fred  Thurman. She went to her end of the stretcher and waited there while  Swan put the rope over his head. They went on, Lorraine walking with her  head averted, trying not to see the blaze-faced roan, trying to shut out  the memory of him dashing past her with his terrible burden, that night.    Swan did not speak of the matter again. With Lorraine's assistance he  carried Brit into Thurman's cabin, laid him, stretcher and all, on the  bed and hurried out to catch and harness the team of work horses.  Lorraine waited beside her father, helpless and miserable. There was  nothing to do but wait, yet waiting seemed to her the one thing she  could not do.    \"Raine!\" Brit's voice was very weak, but Lorraine jumped as though a  trumpet had bellowed suddenly in her ear. \"Swan--he's all right. But  don't go telling--all yuh know and some besides. He ain't--Sawtooth,  but--he might let out----\"    \"I know. I won't, dad. It was that horse----\"    Brit turned his face to the wall as if no more was to be said on the  subject. Lorraine wandered around the cabin, which was no larger than  her father's place. The rooms were scrupulously clean--neater than the  Quirt, she observed guiltily. Not one article, however small and  unimportant, seemed to be out of its place, and the floors of both rooms  were scrubbed whiter than any floors she had ever seen. Swan's  housekeeping qualities made her ashamed of her own imperfections; and  when, thinking that Swan must be hungry and that the least she could do  was to set out food for him, she opened the cupboard, she had a swift,  embarrassed vision of her own culinary imperfections. She could cook  better food than her dad had been content to eat and to set before  others, but Swan's bread was a triumph in sour dough. Biscuits tall and  light as bread can be she found, covered neatly with a cloth. Prunes  stewed so that there was not one single wrinkle in them--Lorraine could  scarcely believe they were prunes until she tasted them. She was  investigating a pot of beans when Swan came in.    \"Food I am thinking of, Miss,\" he grinned at her. \"We shall hurry, but  it is not good to go hungry. Milk is outside in a cupboard. It is  quicker than to make coffee.\"    \"It will be dark before we can get him home,\" said Lorraine uneasily.  \"And by the time a doctor can get out there----\"    \"A doctor will be there, I think. You don't believe, but that is no  difference to his coming just the same.\"    He brought the milk, poured off the creamy top into a pitcher, stirred  it, and quietly insisted that she drink two glasses. Lorraine observed  that Swan himself ate very little, bolting down a biscuit in great  mouthfuls while he carried a mattress and blankets out to spread in the  wagon. It was like his pretense of weariness on the long carry down the  canyon, she thought. It was for her more than for himself that he was  thinking.          CHAPTER TWELVE    THE QUIRT PARRIES THE FIRST BLOW      A car with dimmed lights stood in front of the Quirt cabin when Swan  drove around the last low ridge and down to the gate. The rattle of the  wagon must have been heard, for the door opened suddenly and Frank stood  revealed in the yellow light of the kerosene lamp on the table within.  Behind Frank, Lorraine saw Jim and Sorry standing in their shirt sleeves  looking out into the dark. Another, shorter figure she glimpsed as Frank  and the two men stepped out and came striding hastily toward them.  Lorraine jumped out and ran to meet them, hoping and fearing that her  hope was foolish. That car might easily be only Bob Warfield on some  errand of no importance. Still, she hoped.    \"That you, Raine? Where's Brit? What's all this about Brit being hurt? A  doctor from Shoshone----\"    \"A _doctor_? Oh, did a doctor come, then? Oh, help Swan carry dad in!  I'm--oh, I'm afraid he's awfully injured!\"    \"Yes-s--but how'n hell did a doctor know about it?\" Sorry, the silent,  blurted unexpectedly.    \"Oh,--never mind--but get dad in. I'll----\" She ran past them without  finishing her sentence and burst incoherently into the presence of an  extremely calm little man with gray whiskers and dust on the shoulders  of his coat. These details, I may add, formed the sum of Lorraine's  first impression of him.    \"Well! Well!\" he remonstrated with a professional briskness, when she  nearly bowled him over. \"We seem to be in something of a hurry! Is this  the patient I was sent to examine?\"    \"No!\" Lorraine flashed impatiently over her shoulder as she rushed into  her own room and began turning down the covers. \"It's dad, of  course--and you'd better get your coat off and get ready to go to work,  because I expect he's just one mass of broken bones!\"    The doctor smiled behind his whiskers and returned to the doorway to  direct the carrying in of his patient. His sharp eyes went immediately  to Brit's face, pallid under the leathery tan, his fingers went to  Brit's hairy, corded wrist. The doctor smiled no more that evening.    \"No, he is not a mass of broken bones, I am happy to say,\" he reported  gravely to Lorraine afterwards. \"He has a sufficient number, however.  The left scapula is fractured, likewise the clavicle, and there is a  compound fracture of the femur. There is some injury to the head, the  exact extent of which I cannot as yet determine. He should be removed to  a hospital, unless you are prepared to have a nurse here for some time,  or to assume the burden of a long and tedious illness.\" He looked at her  thoughtfully. \"The journey to Shoshone would be a considerable strain on  the patient in his present condition. He has a splendid amount of  constitutional vitality, or he would scarcely have survived his injuries  so long without medical attendance. Can you tell me just how the  accident occurred?\"    \"Excuse me, doctor--and Miss,\" Swan diffidently interrupted. \"I could  ask you to take a look on my shoulder, if you please. If you are done  setting bones in Mr. Hunter. I have a great pain on my shoulder from  carrying so long.\"    \"You never mentioned it!\" Lorraine reproached him quickly. \"Of course  it must be looked after right away. And then, Doctor, I'd like to talk  to you, if you don't mind.\" She watched them retreat to the bunk-house  together, Swan's big form towering above the doctor's slighter figure.  Swan was talking earnestly, the mumble of his voice reaching Lorraine  without the enunciation of any"]]]
