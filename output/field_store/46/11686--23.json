No less dedicated to abolition of  racial segregation than Hastie, Gibson eschewed the grand gesture and  emphasized those practical changes that could be effected one step at  a time. For all his zeal, Gibson was admirably detached.[2-67] He knew  that his willingness to recognize that years of oppression and  injustice had marred the black soldier's performance would earn for  him the scorn of many civil rights activists, but he also knew that  his fairness made him an effective advocate in the War Department. He  worked closely with McCloy's committee, always describing with his  alternatives for action their probable effect upon the Army, the  public, and the developing military situation. As a result of the  close cooperation between the Advisory Committee and Gibson, the Army  for the first time began to agree on practical if not policy changes.                       [Footnote 2-67: For discussion of Gibson's attitude                     and judgments, see Interv, author with Evans, 3 Jun                     73.]    The Advisory Committee's first campaign was directed at local commanders.  After a long review of the evidence, the committee was convinced that  the major cause of racial disorder was the failure of commanders in  some echelons to appreciate the seriousness of racial unrest and their  own responsibility for dealing with the discipline, morale, and    (p. 042)  welfare of their men. Since it found that most disturbances began with  real or fancied incidents of discrimination, the committee concluded  that there should be no discrimination against Negroes in the matter  of privileges and accommodations and none in favor of Negroes that  compromised disciplinary standards. The committee wanted local  commanders to be reminded that maintaining proper discipline and good  order among soldiers, and between soldiers and civilians, was a  definite command responsibility.[2-68]                       [Footnote 2-68: Memo, Chmn, Advisory Cmte, for CofS,                     3 Jul 43, sub: Negro Troops, ASW 291.2 NT. This was                     not sent until 6 July.]    General Marshall incorporated the committee's recommendations in a  letter to the field. He concluded by saying that \"failure on the part  of any commander to concern himself personally and vigorously with  this problem will be considered as evidence of lack of capacity and  cause for reclassification and removal from assignment.\"[2-69] At the  same time, the Chief of Staff did not adopt several of the committee's  specific recommendations. He did not require local commanders to  recommend changes in War Department policy on the treatment of Negroes  and the organization and employment of black units. Nor did he require  them to report on steps taken by them to follow the committee's  recommendations. Moreover, he did not order the dispatch of black  combat units to active theaters although the committee had pointed to  this course as \"the most effective means of reducing tension among  Negro troops.\"                       [Footnote 2-69: Memo, CofS for CG, AAF, et al., 13                     Jul 43, sub: Negro Troops, WDCSA 291.21.]    Next, the Advisory Committee turned its attention to the black press.  Judge Hastie and the representatives of the senior civil rights  organizations were judicious in their criticism and accurate in their  charges, but this statement could not be made for much of the black  press. Along with deserving credit for spotlighting racial injustices  and giving a very real impetus to racial progress, a segment of the  black press had to share the blame for fomenting racial disorder by  the frequent publication of inaccurate and inflammatory war stories.  Some field commanders charged that the constant criticism was  detrimental to troop morale and demanded that the War Department  investigate and even censor particular black newspapers. In July 1943  the Army Service Forces recommended that General Marshall officially  warn the editors against printing inciting and untrue stories and  suggested that if this caution failed sedition proceedings be  instituted against the culprits.[2-70] General Marshall followed a more  moderate course suggested by Assistant Secretary McCloy.[2-71] The Army  staff amplified and improved the services of the Bureau of Public  Relations by appointing Negroes to the bureau and by releasing more  news items of special interest to black journalists. The result was a  considerable increase in constructive and accurate stories on      (p. 043)  black participation in the war, although articles and editorials  continued to be severely critical of the Army's segregation policy.                       [Footnote 2-70: Memo, Advisory Cmte for CofS, 16 Mar                     43, sub: Inflammatory Publications, ASW 291.2 NT                     Cmte; Memo, CG, 4th Service Cmd, ASF, to CG, ASF,                     12 Jul 43, sub: Disturbances Among Negro Troops,                     with attached note initialed by Gen Marshall, WDCSA                     291.2 (12 Jul 43).]                       [Footnote 2-71: Memo, J. J. McC (John J. McCloy) for                     Gen Marshall, 21 Jul 43, with attached note signed                     \"GCM,\" ASW 291.2 NT.]    The proposal to send black units into combat, rejected by Marshall  when raised by the Advisory Committee in 1943, became the preeminent  racial issue in the Army during the next year.[2-72] It was vitally  necessary, the Advisory Committee reasoned, that black troops not be  wasted by leaving them to train endlessly in camps around the country,  and that the War Department begin making them a \"military asset.\" In  March 1944 it recommended to Secretary Stimson that black units be  introduced into combat and that units and training schedules be  reorganized if necessary to insure that this deployment be carried out  as promptly as possible. Elaborating on the committee's  recommendation, Chairman McCloy added:         There has been a tendency to allow the situation to develop where       selections are made on the basis of efficiency with the result       that the colored units are discarded for combat service, but       little is done by way of studying new means to put them in shape       for combat service.         With so large a portion of our population colored, with the       example of the effective use of colored troops (of a much lower       order of intelligence) by other nations, and with the many       imponderables that are connected with the situation, we must, I       think, be more affirmative about the use of our Negro troops. If       present methods do not bring them to combat efficiency, we should       change those methods. That is what this resolution purports to       recommend.[2-73]                       [Footnote 2-72: Min of Mtg of Advisory Cmte on Negro                     Troop Policies, 29 Feb 44, ASW 291.2 Negro Troops                     Cmte; Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, pp.                     449-50.]                       [Footnote 2-73: Memo, ASW for SW, 2 Mar 44, inclosing                     formal recommendations, WDCSA 291.2/13 Negroes                     (1944).]    Stimson agreed, and on 4 March 1944 the Advisory Committee met with  members of the Army staff to decide on combat assignments for  regimental combat teams from the 92d and 93d Divisions. In order that  both handpicked soldiers and normal units might be tested, the team  from the 93d would come from existing units of that division, and the  one from the 92d would be a specially selected group of volunteers.  General Marshall and his associates continued to view the commitment  of black combat troops as an experiment that might provide  documentation for the future employment of Negroes in combat.[2-74] In  keeping with this experiment, the Army staff suggested to field  commanders how Negroes might be employed and requested continuing  reports on the units' progress.                       [Footnote 2-74: Pogue, _Organizer of Victory_, p.                     99.]    The belated introduction of major black units into combat helped  alleviate the Army's racial problems. After elements of the 93d  Division were committed on Bougainville in March 1944 and an advanced  group of the 92d landed in Italy in July, the Army staff found it  easier to ship smaller supporting units to combat theaters, either as  separate units or as support for larger units, a course that reduced  the glut of black soldiers stationed in the United States. Recognizing  that many of these units had poor leaders, Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair,  head of the Army Ground Forces, ordered that, \"if practicable,\" all  leaders of black units who had not received \"excellent\" or higher  (p. 044)  in their efficiency ratings would be replaced before the units were  scheduled for overseas deployment.[2-75] Given the \"if practicable\"  loophole, there was little chance that all the units would go overseas  with \"excellent\" commanders.                       [Footnote 2-75: Memo, CG, AGF, for CG's, Second Army,                     et al., n.d., sub: Efficiency Ratings of Commanders                     of Negro Units Scheduled for Overseas Shipment,                     GNGAP-L 201.61/9.]    [Illustration: 93D DIVISION TROOPS IN BOUGAINVILLE, APRIL 1944. _Men,  packing mortar shells, cross the West Branch Texas River._]    A source of pride to the black community, the troop commitments also  helped to reduce national racial tensions, but they did little for the  average black soldier who remained stationed in the United States. He  continued to suffer discrimination within and without the gates of the  camp. The committee attributed that discrimination to the fact that  War Department policy was not being carried out in all commands. In  some instances local commanders were unaware of the policy; in others  they refused to pay"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#18)"],[1,"miserable guides, who perceived their end approaching,  humbly implored Carathis, as she had now so good an opportunity, to inter  them, and immediately gave up the ghost.  Nerkes and Cafour, whose wit  was of a style peculiar to themselves, were by no means parsimonious of  it on the folly of these poor people, nor could anything have been found  more suited to their tastes than the site of the burying-ground, and the  sepulchres which its precincts contained; there were at least two  thousand of them on the declivity of a hill: some in the form of  pyramids, others like columns, and, in short, the variety of their shapes  was endless.  Carathis was too much immersed in her sublime  contemplations to stop at the view, charming as it appeared in her eyes;  pondering the advantages that might accrue from her present situation,  she could not forbear to exclaim:    \"So beautiful a cemetery must be haunted by Gouls! and they want not for  intelligence; having heedlessly suffered my guides to expire, I will  apply for directions to them, and as an inducement will invite them to  regale on these fresh corpses.\"    After this short soliloquy she beckoned to Nerkes and Cafour, and made  signs with her fingers, as much as to say, \"Go, knock against the sides  of the tombs, and strike up your delightful warblings, that are so like  to those of the guests whose company I wish to obtain.\"    The negresses, full of joy at the behests of their mistress, and  promising themselves much pleasure from the society of the Gouls, went  with an air of conquest, and began their knockings at the tombs; as their  strokes were repeated a hollow noise was heard in the earth, the surface  hove up into heaps, and the Gouls on all sides protruded their noses, to  inhale the effluvia which the carcases of the wood-men began to emit.    They assembled before a sarcophagus of white marble, where Carathis was  seated between the bodies of her miserable guides; the princess received  her visitants with distinguished politeness, and, when supper was ended,  proceeded with them to business.  Having soon learnt from them everything  she wished to discover, it was her intention to set forward forthwith on  her journey, but her negresses, who were forming tender connections with  the Gouls, importuned her with all their fingers to wait at least till  the dawn.  Carathis, however, being chastity in the abstract, and an  implacable enemy to love and repose, at once rejected their prayer,  mounted Alboufaki, and commanded them to take their seats in a moment;  four days and four nights she continued her route, without turning to the  right hand or left; on the fifth she traversed the mountains and  half-burnt forests, and arrived on the sixth before the beautiful screens  which concealed from all eyes the voluptuous wanderings of her son.    It was daybreak, and the guards were snoring on their posts in careless  security, when the rough trot of Alboufaki awoke them in consternation.  Imagining that a group of spectres ascended from the abyss was  approaching, they all without ceremony took to their heels.  Vathek was  at that instant with Nouronihar in the bath, hearing tales, and laughing  at Bababalouk, who related them; but no sooner did the outcry of his  guards reach him, than he flounced from the water like a carp, and as  soon threw himself back at the sight of Carathis, who, advancing with her  negresses upon Alboufaki, broke through the muslin awnings and veils of  the pavilion; at this sudden apparition Nouronihar (for she was not at  all times free from remorse) fancied that the moment of celestial  vengeance was come, and clung about the Caliph in amorous despondence.    Carathis, still seated on her camel, foamed with indignation at the  spectacle which obtruded itself on her chaste view; she thundered forth  without check or mercy: \"Thou double-headed and four-legged monster! what  means all this winding and writhing? art thou not ashamed to be seen  grasping this limber sapling, in preference to the sceptre of the  pre-adamite Sultans? is it then for this paltry doxy that thou hast  violated the conditions in the parchment of our Giaour? is it on her thou  hast lavished thy precious moments? is this the fruit of the knowledge I  have taught thee? is this the end of thy journey? tear thyself from the  arms of this little simpleton, drown her in the water before me, and  instantly follow my guidance.\"    In the first ebullition of his fury Vathek resolved to make a skeleton of  Alboufaki, and to stuff the skins of Carathis and her blacks; but the  ideas of the Giaour, the palace of Istakar, the sabres and the talismans,  flashing before his imagination with the simultaneousness of lightning,  he became more moderate, and said to his mother, in a civil but decisive  tone: \"Dread lady! you shall be obeyed, but I will not drown Nouronihar;  she is sweeter to me than a Myrabolan comfit, and is enamoured of  carbuncles, especially that of Giamschid, which hath also been promised  to be conferred upon her; she therefore shall go along with us, for I  intend to repose with her beneath the canopies of Soliman; I can sleep no  more without her.\"    \"Be it so!\" replied Carathis, alighting, and at the same time committing  Alboufaki to the charge of her women.    Nouronihar, who had not yet quitted her hold, began to take courage, and  said, with an accent of fondness to the Caliph: \"Dear Sovereign of my  soul!  I will follow thee, if it be thy will, beyond the Kaf in the land  of the Afrits; I will not hesitate to climb for thee the nest of the  Simurgh, who, this lady excepted, is the most awful of created  existences.\"    \"We have here then,\" subjoined Carathis, \"a girl both of courage and  science!\"    Nouronihar had certainly both; but, notwithstanding all her firmness, she  could not help casting back a look of regret upon the graces of her  little Gulchenrouz, and the days of tenderness she had participated with  him; she even dropped a few tears, which Carathis observed, and  inadvertently breathed out with a sigh: \"Alas! my gentle cousin! what  will become of him!\"    Vathek at this apostrophe knitted up his brows, and Carathis inquired  what it could mean.    \"She is preposterously sighing after a stripling with languishing eyes  and soft hair, who loves her,\" said the Caliph.    \"Where is he?\" asked Carathis.  \"I must be acquainted with this pretty  child; for,\" added she, lowering her voice, \"I design before I depart to  regain the favour of the Giaour; there is nothing so delicious in his  estimation as the heart of a delicate boy, palpitating with the first  tumults of love.\"    Vathek, as he came from the bath, commanded Bababalouk to collect the  women and other movables of his harem, embody his troops, and hold  himself in readiness to march in three days; whilst Carathis retired  alone to a tent, where the Giaour solaced her with encouraging visions;  but at length waking, she found at her feet Nerkes and Cafour, who  informed her by their signs that, having led Alboufaki to the borders of  a lake, to browse on some moss that looked tolerably venomous, they had  discovered certain blue fishes of the same kind with those in the  reservoir on the top of the tower.    \"Ah! ha!\" said she, \"I will go thither to them; these fish are past doubt  of a species that, by a small operation, I can render oracular; they may  tell me where this little Gulchenrouz is, whom I am bent upon  sacrificing.\"  Having thus spoken, she immediately set out with her  swarthy retinue.    It being but seldom that time is lost in the accomplishment of a wicked  enterprise, Carathis and her negresses soon arrived at the lake, where,  after burning the magical drugs with which they were always provided,  they, stripping themselves naked, waded to their chins, Nerkes and Cafour  waving torches around them, and Carathis pronouncing her barbarous  incantations.  The fishes with one accord thrust forth their heads from  the water, which was violently rippled by the flutter of their fins, and,  at length finding themselves constrained by the potency of the charm,  they opened their piteous mouths, and said: \"From gills to tail we are  yours; what seek ye to know?\"    \"Fishes,\" answered she, \"I conjure you, by your glittering scales, tell  me where now is Gulchenrouz?\"    \"Beyond the rock,\" replied the shoal in full chorus; \"will this content  you? for we do not delight in expanding our mouths.\"    \"It will,\" returned the princess; \"I am not to learn that you like not  long conversations; I will leave you therefore to repose, though I had  other questions to propound.\"  The instant she had spoken the water  became smooth, and the fishes at once disappeared.    Carathis, inflated with the venom of her projects, strode hastily over  the rock, and found the amiable Gulchenrouz asleep in an arbour, whilst  the two dwarfs were watching at his side, and ruminating their accustomed  prayers.  These diminutive personages possessed the gift of divining  whenever an enemy to good Mussulmans approached; thus they anticipated  the arrival of Carathis, who, stopping short, said to herself: \"How  placidly doth he recline his lovely little head! how pale and languishing  are his looks! it is just the very child of my wishes!\"    The dwarfs interrupted this delectable soliloquy by leaping instantly  upon her, and scratching her face with their utmost zeal.  But Nerkes and  Cafour, betaking themselves to the succour of their mistress, pinched the  dwarfs so severely in return, that they both gave up the ghost, imploring  Mahomet to inflict his sorest vengeance upon this wicked woman and all  her household.    At the noise which this strange conflict occasioned in the valley,  Gulchenrouz awoke, and, bewildered with terror, sprung impetuously upon  an old figtree that rose against the acclivity of the rocks; from thence  gained their summits, and ran for two hours without once"]]]
