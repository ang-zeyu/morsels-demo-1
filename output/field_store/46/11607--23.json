The  quietude of the artist is a reassurance for the public, for it can  come only from the certainty of power and the full command of his task  through study and preparation and perfect knowledge of the work to be  presented. An artist whose art is based on power cannot appear other  than self-possessed and certain of himself. An evident uneasiness is  always inartistic, and hence does not belong where art is to be  embodied. All dependence upon tricks of habit creates nervousness and  lack of flexibility.    Therefore the singer must accustom himself to quietude in practising,  and make his will master of his whole body, that later he may have  free command of all his movements and means of expression.    The constant playing of single tones or chords on the piano by the  teacher during the lesson is wrong, and every pupil should request its  discontinuance. The teacher can hear the pupil, but the latter cannot  hear himself, when this is done; and yet it is of the utmost  importance that he should learn to hear himself. I am almost driven  distracted when teachers bring me their pupils, and drum on the piano  as if possessed while they sing. Pupils have the same effect on me  when they sit and play a dozen chords to one long note.    Do they sit in the evening when they sing in a concert?    Do they hear themselves, when they do this? Unfortunately, I cannot  hear them.    Poor pupils!    It is enough for a musical person to strike a single note on the piano  when he practises alone, or perhaps a common chord, after which the  body and hands should return to their quiet natural position. Only in  a standing posture can a free deep breath be drawn, and mind and body  be properly prepared for the exercise or the song to follow.    It is also well for pupils to form sentences with the proper number of  syllables upon which to sing their exercises, so that even such  exercises shall gradually gain a certain amount of expressiveness.  Thus the exercises will form pictures which must be connected with the  play of the features, as well as with an inner feeling, and thus will  not become desultory and soulless and given over to indifference. Of  course not till the mere tone itself is brought under complete  control, and uncertainty is no longer possible, can the horizon of the  pupil be thus widened without danger.    Only when a scene requires that a vocal passage be sung kneeling or  sitting must the singer practise it in his room long before the  performance and at all rehearsals, in accordance with dramatic  requirements of the situation. _Otherwise the singer should always_  STAND. We must also look out for unaccustomed garments that may be  required on the stage, and rehearse in them; for instance, hat,  helmet, hood, cloak, etc. Without becoming accustomed to them by  practice, the singer may easily make himself ridiculous on the stage.  Hence comes the absurdity of a Lohengrin who cannot sing with a  helmet, another who cannot with a shield, a third who cannot with  gauntlets; a Wanderer who cannot with the big hat, another who cannot  with the spear, a Jose who cannot with the helmet, etc. All these  things must be practised before a mirror until the requirements of a  part or its costume become a habit. To attain this, the singer must be  completely master of his body and all his movements.    It must be precisely the same with the voice. The singer must be quite  independent of bad habits in order consciously to exact from it what  the proper interpretation of the work to be performed requires.    He should practise only so long as can be done without weariness.  After every exercise he should take a rest, to be fresh for the next  one. After the great scale he should rest _at least_ ten minutes; and  these resting times must be observed as long as one sings.    Long-continued exertion should not be exacted of the voice at first;  even if the effects of it are not immediately felt, a damage is done  in some way. In this matter pupils themselves are chiefly at fault,  because they cannot get enough, as long as they take pleasure in it.    For this reason it is insane folly to try to sing important roles on  the stage after one or two years of study; it may perhaps be endured  for one or two years without evil results, but it can never be  carried on indefinitely.    Agents and managers commit a crime when they demand enormous exertions  of such young singers. The rehearsals, which are held in abominably  bad air, the late hours, the irregular life that is occasioned by  rehearsals, the strain of standing around for five or six hours in a  theatre,--all this is not for untrained young persons. No woman of  less than twenty-four years should sing soubrette parts, none of less  than twenty-eight years second parts, and none of less than  thirty-five years dramatic parts; that is early enough. By that time  proper preparation can be made, and in voice and person something can  be offered worth while. And our fraternity must realize this sooner or  later. In that way, too, they will learn more and be able to do more,  and fewer sins will be committed against the art of song by the  incompetent.          SECTION XXXVI    CONCERNING EXPRESSION      When we wish to study a role or a song, we have first to master the  intellectual content of the work. Not till we have made ourselves a  clear picture of the whole should we proceed to elaborate the details,  through which, however, the impression of the whole should never be  allowed to suffer. The complete picture should always shine out  through all. If it is too much broken into details, it becomes a thing  of shreds and patches.    So petty accessories must be avoided, that the larger outline of the  whole picture shall not suffer. The complete picture must ever claim  the chief interest; details should not distract attention from it. In  art, subordination of the parts to the whole is an art of itself.  Everything must be fitted to the larger lineaments that should  characterize a masterpiece.    A word is an idea; and not only the idea, but how that idea in color  and connection is related to the whole, must be expressed. Therein is  the fearsome magic that Wagner has exercised upon me and upon all  others, that draws us to him and lets none escape its spell. That is  why the elaboration of Wagner's creations seems so much worth while to  the artist. Every elaboration of a work of art demands the sacrifice  of some part of the artist's ego, for he must mingle the feelings set  before him for portrayal with his own in his interpretation, and thus,  so to speak, lay bare his very self. But since we must impersonate  human beings, we may not spare ourselves, but throw ourselves into our  task with the devotion of all our powers.          SECTION XXXVII    BEFORE THE PUBLIC      In the wide reaches of the theatre it is needful to give an  exaggeration to the expression, which in the concert hall, where the  forms of society rule, must be entirely abandoned. And yet the picture  must be presented by the artist to the public from the very first  word, the very first note; the mood must be felt in advance. This  depends partly upon the bearing of the singer and the expression of  countenance he has during the prelude, whereby interest in what is  coming is aroused and is directed upon the music as well as upon the  poem.    The picture is complete in itself; I have only to vivify its colors  during the performance. Upon the management of the body, upon the  electric current which should flow between the artist and the  public,--a current that often streams forth at his very appearance,  but often is not to be established at all,--depend the glow and  effectiveness of the color which we impress upon our picture.    No artist should be beguiled by this into giving forth more than  artistic propriety permits, either to enhance the enthusiasm or to  intensify the mood; for the electric connection cannot be forced.  Often a tranquillizing feeling is very soon manifest on both sides,  the effect of which is quite as great, even though less stimulating.  Often, too, a calm, still understanding between singer and public  exercises a fascination upon both, that can only be attained through a  complete devotion to the task in hand, and renunciation of any attempt  to gain noisy applause.    To me it is a matter of indifference whether the public goes frantic  or listens quietly and reflectively, for I give out only what I have  undertaken to. If I have put my individuality, my powers, my love for  the work, into a role or a song that is applauded by the public, I  decline all thanks for it to myself personally, and consider the  applause as belonging to the master whose work I am interpreting. If I  have succeeded in making him intelligible to the public, the reward  therefor is contained in that fact itself, and I ask for nothing more.    Of what is implied in the intelligent interpretation of a work of art,  as to talent and study, the public has no conception. Only they can  understand it whose lives have been devoted to the same ideals. The  lasting understanding of such, or even of a part of the public, is  worth more than all the storm of applause that is given to so many.    All the applause in the world cannot repay me for the sacrifices I  have made for art, and no applause in the world is able to beguile me  from the dissatisfaction I feel over the failure of a single tone or  attempted expression.    What seems to me bad, because I demand the greatest things of myself,  is, to be sure, good enough for many others. I am, however, not of  their opinion. In any matter relating to art, only the best is good  enough for any public. If the public is uncultivated, one must make it  know the best, must educate it, must teach it to understand the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#18)"],[1,"  =Handel, George Frideric=    Vol. I.
