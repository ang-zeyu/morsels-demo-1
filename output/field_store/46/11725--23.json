Directly\"--the Roman smiled  derisively--\"directly Jupiter and his whole family, Greek and Latin,  will come to me, as is their habit, and make an end of serious speech.  I am mindful of your goodness in walking from the old house of your  fathers to welcome me back and renew the love of our childhood--if  we can. 'Go,' said my teacher, in his last lecture--'Go, and,  to make your lives great, remember Mars reigns and Eros has found  his eyes.' He meant love is nothing, war everything. It is so  in Rome. Marriage is the first step to divorce. Virtue is a  tradesman's jewel. Cleopatra, dying, bequeathed her arts, and is  avenged; she has a successor in every Roman's house. The world is  going the same way; so, as to our future, down Eros, up Mars! I am  to be a soldier; and you, O my Judah, I pity you; what can you be?\"    The Jew moved nearer the pool; Messala's drawl deepened.    \"Yes, I pity you, my fine Judah. From the college to the synagogue;  then to the Temple; then--oh, a crowning glory!--the seat in the  Sanhedrim. A life without opportunities; the gods help you! But  I--\"    Judah looked at him in time to see the flush of pride that kindled  in his haughty face as he went on.    \"But I--ah, the world is not all conquered. The sea has islands  unseen. In the north there are nations yet unvisited. The glory  of completing Alexander's march to the Far East remains to some  one. See what possibilities lie before a Roman.\"    Next instant he resumed his drawl.    \"A campaign into Africa; another after the Scythian; then--a legion!  Most careers end there; but not mine. I--by Jupiter! what a  conception!--I will give up my legion for a prefecture. Think of  life in Rome with money--money, wine, women, games--poets at the  banquet, intrigues in the court, dice all the year round. Such a  rounding of life may be--a fat prefecture, and it is mine. O my  Judah, here is Syria! Judea is rich; Antioch a capital for the  gods. I will succeed Cyrenius, and you--shall share my fortune.\"    The sophists and rhetoricians who thronged the public resorts of  Rome, almost monopolizing the business of teaching her patrician  youth, might have approved these sayings of Messala, for they were  all in the popular vein; to the young Jew, however, they were new,  and unlike the solemn style of discourse and conversation to which he  was accustomed. He belonged, moreover, to a race whose laws, modes,  and habits of thought forbade satire and humor; very naturally,  therefore, he listened to his friend with varying feelings; one  moment indignant, then uncertain how to take him. The superior  airs assumed had been offensive to him in the beginning; soon they  became irritating, and at last an acute smart. Anger lies close by  this point in all of us; and that the satirist evoked in another  way. To the Jew of the Herodian period patriotism was a savage  passion scarcely hidden under his common humor, and so related  to his history, religion, and God that it responded instantly to  derision of them. Wherefore it is not speaking too strongly to say  that Messala's progress down to the last pause was exquisite torture  to his hearer; at that point the latter said, with a forced smile,    \"There are a few, I have heard, who can afford to make a jest of  their future; you convince me, O my Messala, that I am not one  of them.\"    The Roman studied him; then replied, \"Why not the truth in a jest  as well as a parable? The great Fulvia went fishing the other day;  she caught more than all the company besides. They said it was  because the barb of her hook was covered with gold.\"    \"Then you were not merely jesting?\"    \"My Judah, I see I did not offer you enough,\" the Roman answered,  quickly, his eyes sparkling. \"When I am prefect, with Judea to  enrich me, I--will make you high-priest.\"    The Jew turned off angrily.    \"Do not leave me,\" said Messala.    The other stopped irresolute.    \"Gods, Judah, how hot the sun shines!\" cried the patrician,  observing his perplexity. \"Let us seek a shade.\"    Judah answered, coldly,    \"We had better part. I wish I had not come. I sought a friend and  find a--\"    \"Roman,\" said Messala, quickly.    The hands of the Jew clenched, but controlling himself again,  he started off. Messala arose, and, taking the mantle from the  bench, flung it over his shoulder, and followed after; when he  gained his side, he put his hand upon his shoulder and walked  with him.    \"This is the way--my hand thus--we used to walk when we were  children. Let us keep it as far as the gate.\"    Apparently Messala was trying to be serious and kind, though he  could not rid his countenance of the habitual satirical expression.  Judah permitted the familiarity.    \"You are a boy; I am a man; let me talk like one.\"    The complacency of the Roman was superb. Mentor lecturing the  young Telemachus could not have been more at ease.    \"Do you believe in the Parcae? Ah, I forgot, you are a Sadducee:  the Essenes are your sensible people; they believe in the sisters.  So do I. How everlastingly the three are in the way of our doing  what we please! I sit down scheming. I run paths here and there.  Perpol! Just when I am reaching to take the world in hand, I hear  behind me the grinding of scissors. I look, and there she is,  the accursed Atropos! But, my Judah, why did you get mad when I  spoke of succeeding old Cyrenius? You thought I meant to enrich  myself plundering your Judea. Suppose so; it is what some Roman  will do. Why not I?\"    Judah shortened his step.    \"There have been strangers in mastery of Judea before the Roman,\"  he said, with lifted hand. \"Where are they, Messala? She has outlived  them all. What has been will be again.\"    Messala put on his drawl.    \"The Parcae have believers outside the Essenes. Welcome, Judah,  welcome to the faith!\"    \"No, Messala, count me not with them. My faith rests on the rock  which was the foundation of the faith of my fathers back further than  Abraham; on the covenants of the Lord God of Israel.\"    \"Too much passion, my Judah. How my master would have been shocked  had I been guilty of so much heat in his presence! There were other  things I had to tell you, but I fear to now.\"    When they had gone a few yards, the Roman spoke again.    \"I think you can hear me now, especially as what I have to say  concerns yourself. I would serve you, O handsome as Ganymede;  I would serve you with real good-will. I love you--all I can.  I told you I meant to be a soldier. Why not you also? Why not  you step out of the narrow circle which, as I have shown, is all  of noble life your laws and customs allow?\"    Judah made no reply.    \"Who are the wise men of our day?\" Messala continued. \"Not they  who exhaust their years quarrelling about dead things; about Baals,  Joves, and Jehovahs; about philosophies and religions. Give me one  great name, O Judah; I care not where you go to find it--to Rome,  Egypt, the East, or here in Jerusalem--Pluto take me if it belong  not to a man who wrought his fame out of the material furnished him  by the present; holding nothing sacred that did not contribute to  the end, scorning nothing that did! How was it with Herod? How with  the Maccabees? How with the first and second Caesars? Imitate them.  Begin now. At hand see--Rome, as ready to help you as she was the  Idumaean Antipater.\"    The Jewish lad trembled with rage; and, as the garden gate was  close by, he quickened his steps, eager to escape.    \"O Rome, Rome!\" he muttered.    \"Be wise,\" continued Messala. \"Give up the follies of Moses and  the traditions; see the situation as it is. Dare look the Parcae  in the face, and they will tell you, Rome is the world. Ask them of  Judea, and they will answer, She is what Rome wills.\"    They were now at the gate. Judah stopped, and took the hand gently  from his shoulder, and confronted Messala, tears trembling in his  eyes.    \"I understand you, because you are a Roman; you cannot understand  me--I am an Israelite. You have given me suffering to-day by convincing  me that we can never be the friends we have been--never! Here we part.  The peace of the God of my fathers abide with you!\"    Messala offered him his hand; the Jew walked on through the gateway.  When he was gone, the Roman was silent awhile; then he, too, passed  through, saying to himself, with a toss of the head,    \"Be it so. Eros is dead, Mars reigns!\"          CHAPTER III      From the entrance to the Holy City, equivalent to what is now  called St. Stephen's Gate, a street extended westwardly, on a  line parallel with the northern front of the Tower of Antonia,  though a square from that famous castle. Keeping the course as  far as the Tyropoeon Valley, which it followed a little way south,  it turned and again ran west until a short distance beyond what  tradition tells us was the Judgment Gate, from whence it broke  abruptly south. The traveller or the student familiar with the  sacred locality will recognize the thoroughfare described as part  of the Via Dolorosa--with Christians of more interest, though of  a melancholy kind, than any street in the world. As the purpose  in view does not at present require dealing with the whole street,  it will be sufficient to point out a house standing in the angle last  mentioned as marking the change of direction south, and which, as an  important centre of interest, needs somewhat particular description.    The building fronted north and west, probably four hundred feet  each way, and, like most pretentious Eastern structures, was two  stories in height, and perfectly quadrangular. The street on the  west side was about twelve feet wide, that on the north not more  than ten; so that one walking close to the walls, and looking up  at them, would have been struck by the rude, unfinished, uninviting,  but strong and imposing, appearance they presented; for they were of  stone laid in large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#18)"],[1,"he lost his head.    The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge  when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal  the like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live  hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He  sprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the Yeehats), ripping  the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.  He did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with  the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There was  no withstanding him. He plunged about in their very midst, tearing,  rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the  arrows they discharged at him. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his  movements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they  shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear  at Buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with  such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood  out beyond. Then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to  the woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.    And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and  dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was  a fateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the  country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors  gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses. As for  Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated camp. He  found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment  of surprise. Thornton's desperate struggle was fresh-written on the  earth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep  pool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay Skeet, faithful  to the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice  boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it contained John  Thornton; for Buck followed his trace into the water, from which no  trace led away.    All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.  Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the  lives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead. It  left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which  ached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he paused  to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain of it;  and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,--a pride  greater than any he had yet experienced. He had killed man, the noblest  game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang.  He sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It was harder  to kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all, were it  not for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he would be  unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows,  spears, and clubs.    Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,  lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the coming  of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became alive to a  stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats  had made, He stood up, listening and scenting. From far away drifted a  faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the  moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again Buck knew them  as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory. He  walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It was the call,  the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever  before. And as never before, he was ready to obey. John Thornton was  dead. The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer bound  him.    Hunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the flanks  of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the  land of streams and timber and invaded Buck's valley. Into the clearing  where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; and in the  centre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue, waiting their  coming. They were awed, so still and large he stood, and a moment's  pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him. Like a flash  Buck struck, breaking the neck. Then he stood, without movement, as  before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him. Three others  tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they drew back,  streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.    This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded  together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the  prey. Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.  Pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere  at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did  he whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them from getting  behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the creek  bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. He worked along to a  right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining,  and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides and with  nothing to do but face the front.    And so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves  drew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the  white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying down  with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet,  watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool. One  wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly manner,  and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night  and a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they touched  noses.    Then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed  his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,  Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke  out the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And now the call  came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat down and howled. This  over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him, sniffing  in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders lifted the yelp of the  pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung in behind, yelping  in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with the wild brother,  yelping as he ran.       *  *  *  *  *    And here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when  the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were  seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white  centring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the Yeehats tell  of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are afraid of  this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they, stealing from  their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps, slaying their dogs,  and defying their bravest hunters.    Nay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to  the camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with  throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow  greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats follow  the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they never  enter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over  the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an  abiding-place.    In the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which  the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,  and yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling  timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here  a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into  the ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould  overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for  a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.    But he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the  wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running  at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering  borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow  as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack."]]]
