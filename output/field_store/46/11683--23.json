While they stood there consulting, the prince suddenly felt  so overwhelmed with fatigue that he could hold out no longer, but  laying his head in Siminok's lap, asked him to stroke his hair.    While he was doing so, Siminok stopped and said:    \"What is the matter with your head, Brother Busujok?\"    \"What should be the matter? How do I know, Brother Siminok?\"    \"Just see,\" replied Siminok, \"two locks of your hair are tied  together.\"    \"How is that possible?\" said Busujok. This discovery vexed the prince  so much that he determined to go out into the wide world.    \"Brother Siminok,\" he said, \"I'm going out into the wide world,  because I can't understand why my mother tied my hair while she was  playing with it.\"    \"Listen to reason, Brother Busujok, and do nothing of the sort,\"  replied Siminok; \"if the empress tied your hair, it certainly was not  for any evil purpose.\"    But Busujok remained firm in his resolve, and when he took leave of  Siminok, he said to him:    \"Take this handkerchief, Brother Siminok, and if you ever see three  drops of blood on it, you will know that I am dead.\"    \"May the Lord help you, Brother Busujok, that you may prosper; but I  beg you once more by my love, stay!\"    \"Impossible,\" replied Busujok.    Then the youths embraced each other, and Busujok departed; Siminok  remained behind, gazing longingly after him till he was out of sight.    Siminok then returned to the palace and related all that had happened.    The empress was insane with grief. She wrung her hands and wept till  it was pitiful to see her. But she did not know what to do, and at  last comforted herself a little by gazing at Siminok. After some time  the latter took out the prince's handkerchief, looked at it, and saw  three drops of blood on it. Then he said:    \"Oh! my royal brother is dead. I shall go and look for him.\"    Taking some provisions for the journey, he set out in search of  Busujok. He passed through cities and villages, crossed fields and  forests, wandering on and on till he reached a small hut. There he  met an old woman, whom he asked about his brother. The crone told him  that Busujok had become the son of the emperor who reigned in the  neighborhood.    When Siminok reached this emperor's palace, the princess, as soon as  she saw him, thought that he was her husband and came running to meet  him. But he said: \"I am your husband's brother; I have heard that he  is dead, and came here to learn something about him.\"    \"I can not believe it,\" replied the princess. \"You are my husband, and  I don't know why you deny it. Has my faith been put to any test, and  have I ever deceived you?\"    \"Nothing of the sort. But I tell you truthfully that I am not your  husband.\"    The princess would not believe this, so Siminok said:    \"The Lord will show the truth. Let the sword hanging on yonder nail  scratch whichever of us two is mistaken.\"    Instantly the sword sprang down and cut the princess' finger. Then she  believed Siminok, and gave him the hospitality which was his due.    The next day he learned that Busujok had gone out hunting and had not  yet returned. So he, too, mounted a horse, took some greyhounds, and  rode after his brother, following the direction in which he had gone.  He rode on and on till he reached a forest, where he met the Wood  Witch. As soon as he saw her, he set off after her. She fled, he  pursued, until perceiving no way of escape she swung herself up into a  tall tree.    Siminok dismounted, tied his horse to a tree, made a fire, took out  his provisions, and began to eat, occasionally tossing the greyhounds  something.    \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I'm so cold,\" said the Wood Witch, \"my teeth are  chattering.\"    \"Get down and warm yourself by the fire,\" replied Siminok.    \"I'm afraid of the dogs,\" she said.    \"Don't be frightened, they'll do you no harm.\"    \"If you want to do me a favor,\" the Wood Witch answered, \"take a  strand of my hair and tie your dogs with it.\"    Siminok put the hair in the fire.    \"Oh! how horribly the hair I gave you smells--you have put it in the  fire.\"    \"Go away from here and don't talk any more nonsense,\" replied Siminok.  \"One of the hounds put its tail a little too near the fire and  scorched it, that's what smells so badly. If you are cold, come down  and warm yourself, if not, hold your tongue and let me alone.\"    The Wood Witch believed him, came down, approached the fire, and said:    \"I am hungry.\"    \"What shall I give you to eat? Take what you want of all I have.\"    \"I should like to eat you,\" said the Wood Witch, \"prepare for it.\"    \"And I will devour you,\" replied Siminok.    He set the hounds upon her to tear her to pieces.    \"Stop,\" cried the Wood Witch, \"call off your dogs that they may not  tear me, and I'll give you back your brother with his horse, hounds,  and all.\"    Siminok called off the dogs.    The Wood Witch swallowed three times and up came Busujok, his horse,  and his dogs. Siminok now set his hounds upon her, and they tore her  into mince-meat. When Busujok recovered his senses, he wondered at  seeing Siminok there and said:    \"Welcome, I'm glad to meet you so well and gay, Brother Siminok, but  I've been asleep a very long time.\"    \"You might have slept soundly till the end of the world, if I had not  come?\" he replied.    Then Siminok told him every thing that had happened from their parting  until that moment.    But Busujok suspected him; he thought that Siminok had won his wife's  love, and would not believe him when he told him the simple  truth--that such an idea had never entered his head.    Now that Busujok had once begun to be jealous of his bride, he acted  like a lunatic! So, being overpowered by evil thoughts, he made an  agreement with Siminok to bandage the eyes of their horses, mount  them, and let them carry their riders wherever they would.    This was done. When Busujok heard a groan he stopped his horse, untied  the bandage, and looked around him. Siminok was nowhere to be seen.  Just think! He had fallen into a spring, been drowned, and never came  out again!    Busujok returned home and questioned his wife; she told just the same  story as Siminok. Then, to be still more certain of the truth, he,  too, ordered the sword to jump down from the wall and scratch the one  who was wrong. The sword leaped down and wounded his middle finger.    The prince pined away, lamenting and weeping bitterly for the loss of  Siminok, and sorely repenting his undue haste, but all was vain,  nothing could be changed. So, in his grief and anguish, he resolved  not to live any longer without his brother, ordered his own eyes and  those of his horse to be bandaged, mounted it, and bade it hasten to  the forest where Siminok had perished. The horse went as fast as it  could, and plump! it tumbled into the very same spring where Siminok  had fallen, and there Busujok, too, ended his days. But at the same  time the morning star, the emperor's son Busujok, and the evening  star, the maid-servant's son Siminok, appeared in the sky.        Into the saddle then I sprung,      This tale to tell to old and young.          The Two Step-Sisters.      Once upon a time there was an old widower, who had one daughter; he  married again and took for his wife a widow, who also had a daughter.  The widow's daughter was ugly, lazy, obstinate and spiteful; yet as  she was her mother's own child, the latter was delighted with her and  pushed every thing upon her husband's daughter. But the old man's  child was beautiful, industrious, obedient and good. God had gifted  her with every virtuous and lovable quality, yet she was persecuted by  her spiteful sister, as well as by her step-mother; it was fortunate  that she possessed endurance and patience, or she would have fared  badly. Whenever there was any hard work to be done, it was put upon  the old man's daughter--she was obliged to get dry wood from the  forest, drag the heavy sacks of grain to the mill; in short, every  task always fell to her lot. The whole livelong day she had no rest,  but was kept continually going up stairs and down. Still the old woman  and her treasure of a daughter were constantly dissatisfied, and  always had something to find fault with. The step-daughter was a  heavy cross to the second wife, but her own daughter was like the  basil plant, which is placed before the images of the saints.    When the step-sisters went to the village in the evening to spin, the  old man's daughter did not allow herself to be interrupted in her  work, but finished a whole sieve full of spools, while the old woman's  daughter with difficulty completed a single one. When they came home  late at night, the old woman's daughter jumped nimbly over the fence  and asked to hold the sieve till the other had leaped over it too.  Meantime the spiteful girl hurried into the house to her parents, and  said she had spun all the spools. The step-sister vainly declared that  they were the work of her own hands; mother and daughter jeered at her  words, and of course gained their cause. When Sunday or Friday came  the old woman's daughter was brushed and bedizened as though the  calves had licked her. There was no dance, no feather-plucking in the  village to which the old woman's daughter did not go, but the  step-daughter was sternly denied every pleasure of the kind. Yet when  the husband came home, his wife's tongue ran like a mill-wheel--her  step-daughter was disobedient, bold, bad-tempered, this, that, and the  other; he must send her away from home, put her out at service,  whichever he chose; it was impossible to keep her in the house because  she might ruin her daughter too.    The old man was a jackanapes, or, as the saying goes, under petticoat  government. Every thing his wife said was sacred. Had he obeyed the  voice of his heart the poor old man might perhaps have said something,  but now the hen had begun to crow in the house, and the rooster was of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#18)"],[1,"to be active; the fourth, that of the retreat of the  seas, and the fifth the age when the elephants, the hippopotamus, and  other southern animals lived in the regions of the north; the sixth,  when the two continents, America and the old world, became separate; the  seventh and last being the age of man. Above all, by his attractive  style and bold suggestions he popularized the subjects and created an  interest in these matters and a spirit of inquiry which spread  throughout France and the rest of Europe.    But notwithstanding the crude and uncritical nature of the writings of  the second half of the eighteenth century, resulting from the lack of  that more careful and detailed observation which characterizes our day,  there was during this period a widespread interest in physical and  natural science, and it led up to that more exact study of nature which  signalizes the nineteenth century. \"More new truths concerning the  external world,\" says Buckle, \"were discovered in France during the  latter half of the eighteenth century than during all preceding periods  put together.\"[66] As Perkins[67] says: \"Interest in scientific study,  as in political investigation, seemed to rise suddenly from almost  complete inactivity to extraordinary development. In both departments  English thinkers had led the way, but if the impulse to such  investigations came from without, the work done in France in every  branch of scientific research during the eighteenth century was excelled  by no other nation, and England alone could assert any claim to results  of equal importance. The researches of Coulomb in electricity, of Buffon  in geology, of Lavoisier in chemistry, of Daubenton in comparative  anatomy, carried still farther by their illustrious successors towards  the close of the century, did much to establish conceptions of the  universe and its laws upon a scientific basis.\" And not only did  Rousseau make botany fashionable, but Goldsmith wrote from Paris in  1755: \"I have seen as bright a circle of beauty at the chemical lectures  of Rouelle as gracing the court of Versailles.\" Petit lectured on  astronomy to crowded houses, and among his listeners were gentlemen and  ladies of fashion, as well as professional students.[68] The  popularizers of science during this period were Voltaire, Montesquieu,  Alembert, Diderot, and other encyclopaedists.    Here should be mentioned one of Buffon's contemporaries and countrymen;  one who was the first true field geologist, an observer rather than a  compiler or theorist. This was Jean E. Guettard (1715-1786). He  published, says Sir Archibald Geikie, in his valuable work, _The  Founders of Geology_, about two hundred papers on a wide range of  scientific subjects, besides half a dozen quarto volumes of his  observations, together with many excellent plates. Geikie also states  that he is undoubtedly entitled to rank among the first great pioneers  of modern geology. He was the first (1751) to make a geological map of  northern France, and roughly traced the limits of his three bands or  formations from France across the southeastern English counties. In his  work on \"The degradation of mountains effected in our time by heavy  rains, rivers, and the sea,\"[69] he states that the sea is the most  potent destroyer of the land, and that the material thus removed is  deposited either on the land or along the shores of the sea. He thought  that the levels of the valleys are at present being raised, owing to the  deposit of detritus in them. He points out that the deposits laid down  by the ocean do not extend far out to sea, \"that consequently the  elevations of new mountains in the sea, by the deposition of sediment,  is a process very difficult to conceive; that the transport of the  sediment as far as the equator is not less improbable; and that still  more difficult to accept is the suggestion that the sediment from our  continent is carried into the seas of the New World. In short, we are  still very little advanced towards the theory of the earth as it now  exists.\" Guettard was the first to discover the volcanoes of Auvergne,  but he was \"hopelessly wrong\" in regard to the origin of basalt,  forestalling Werner in his mistakes as to its aqueous origin. He was  thus the first Neptunist, while, as Geikie states, his \"observations in  Auvergne practically started the Vulcanist camp.\"    We now come to Lamarck's own time. He must have been familiar with the  results of Pallas's travels in Russia and Siberia (1793-94). The  distinguished German zooelogist and geologist, besides working out the  geology of the Ural Mountains, showed, in 1777, that there was a general  law in the formation of all mountain chains composed chiefly of primary  rocks;[70] the granitic axis being flanked by schists, and these by  fossiliferous strata. From his observations made on the Volga and about  its mouth, he presented proofs of the former extension, in comparatively  recent times, of the Caspian Sea. But still more pregnant and remarkable  was his discovery of an entire rhinoceros, with its flesh and skin, in  the frozen soil of Siberia. His memoir on this animal places him among  the forerunners of, if not within the ranks of, the founders of  palaeontology.    Meanwhile Soldani, an Italian, had, in 1780, shown that the limestone  strata of Italy had accumulated in a deep sea, at least far from land,  and he was the first to observe the alternation of marine and  fresh-water strata in the Paris basin.    Lamarck must have taken much interest in the famous controversy between  the Vulcanists and Neptunists. He visited Freyburg in 1771; whether he  met Werner is not known, as Werner began to lecture in 1775. He must  have personally known Faujas of Paris, who, in 1779, published his  description of the volcanoes of Vivarais and Velay; while Desmarest's  (1725-1815) elaborate work on the volcanoes of Auvergne, published in  1774, in which he proved the igneous origin of basalt, was the best  piece of geological exploration which had yet been accomplished, and is  still a classic.[71]    Werner (1750-1817), the propounder of the Neptunian theory, was one of  the founders of modern geology and of palaeontology. His work entitled  _Ueber die auessern Kennzeichen der Fossilien_ appeared in 1774; his  _Kurze Klassifikation und Beschreibung der Gebirgsarten_ in 1787. He  discovered the law of the superposition of stratified rocks, though he  wrongly considered volcanic rocks, such as basalt, to be of aqueous  origin, being as he supposed formed of chemical precipitates from water.  But he was the first to state that the age of different formations can  be told by their fossils, certain species being confined to particular  beds, while others ranged throughout whole formations, and others seemed  to occur in several different formations; \"the original species found in  these formations appearing to have been so constituted as to live  through a variety of changes which had destroyed hundreds of other  species which we find confined to particular beds.\"[72] His views as  regards fossils, as Jameson states, were probably not known to Cuvier,  and it is more than doubtful whether Lamarck knew of them. He observed  that fossils appear first in \"transition\" or palaeozoic strata, and were  mainly corals and molluscs; that in the older carboniferous rocks the  fossils are of higher types, such as fish and amphibious animals; while  in the tertiary or alluvial strata occur the remains of birds and  quadrupeds. He thought that marine plants were more ancient than land  plants. His studies led him to infer that the fossils contained in the  oldest rocks are very different from any of the species of the present  time; that the newer the formation, the more do the remains approach in  form to the organic beings of the present creation, and that in the  very latest formations, fossil remains of species now existing occur.  Such advanced views as these would seem to entitle Werner to rank as one  of the founders of palaeontology.[73]    Hutton's _Theory of the Earth_ appeared in 1785, and in a more developed  state, as a separate work, in 1795.[74] \"The ruins of an older world,\"  he said, \"are visible in the present structure of our planet, and the  strata which now compose our continents have been once beneath the sea,  and were formed out of the waste of preexisting continents. The same  forces are still destroying, by chemical decomposition or mechanical  violence, even the hardest rocks, and transporting the materials to the  sea, where they are spread out and form strata analogous to those of  more ancient date. Although loosely deposited along the bottom of the  ocean, they became afterwards altered and consolidated by volcanic heat,  and were then heaved up, fractured, and contorted.\" Again he said: \"In  the economy of the world I can find no traces of a beginning, no  prospect of an end.\" As Lyell remarks: \"Hutton imagined that the  continents were first gradually destroyed by aqueous degradation, and  when their ruins had furnished materials for new continents, they were  upheaved by violent convulsions. He therefore required alternate periods  of general disturbance and repose.\"    To Hutton, therefore, we are indebted for the idea of the immensity of  the duration of time. He was the forerunner of Lyell and of the  uniformitarian school of geologists.    Hutton observed that fossils characterized certain strata, but the value  of fossils as time-marks and the principle of the superposition of  stratified fossiliferous rocks were still more clearly established by  William Smith, an English surveyor, in 1790. Meanwhile the Abbe Hauey,  the founder of crystallography, was in 1802 Professor of Mineralogy in  the Jardin des Plantes.      _Lamarck's Contributions to Physical Geology; his Theory of the Earth._    Such were the amount and kind of knowledge regarding the origin and  structure of our earth which "]]]
