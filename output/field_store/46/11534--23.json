It is generally admitted that the war against Arame       falls under his tenth year, and the war against Ben-hadad       during his eleventh year. The scribes must have had at their       disposal two different versions of one document, in which       these two wars were described without distinction of year.       The compiler of the inscription of the Bulls would have       considered them as forming two distinct accounts, which he       has placed one after the other.    In 849 B.C. it was the turn of Damascus. The league of which Ben-hadad  had proclaimed himself the suzerain was still in existence, but it had  recently narrowly escaped dissolution, and a revolt had almost deprived  it of the adherence of Israel and the house of Omri--after Hamath,  the most active of all its members. The losses suffered at Qarqar had  doubtless been severe enough to shake Ahab's faith in the strength of  his master and ally. Besides this, it would appear that the latter had  not honourably fulfilled all the conditions of the treaty of peace he  had signed three years previously; he still held the important fortress  of Bamoth-gilead, and he delayed handing it over to Ahab in spite of his  oath to restore it. Finding that he could not regain possession of it by  fair means, Ahab resolved to take it by force. A great change in feeling  and politics had taken place at Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat, who occupied the  throne, was, like his father Asa, a devout worshipper of Jahveh, but  his piety did not blind him to the secular needs of the moment. The  experience of his predecessors had shown that the union of the twelve  tribes under the rule of a scion of Judah was a thing of the past for  ever; all attempts to restore it had ended in failure and bloodshed,  and the house of David had again only lately been saved from ruin by the  dearly bought intervention of Ben-hadad I. and his Syrians. Jehoshaphat  from the outset clearly saw the necessity of avoiding these errors of  the past; he accepted the situation and sought the friendship of Israel.  An alliance between two princes so unequal in power could only result in  a disguised suzerainty for one of them and a state of vassalage for  the other; what Ben-hadad's alliance was to Ahab, that of Ahab was to  Jehoshaphat, and it served his purpose in spite of the opposition of  the prophets.1 The strained relations between the two countries were  relaxed, and the severed tribes on both sides of the frontier set about  repairing their losses; while Hiel the Bethelite at length set about  rebuilding Jericho on behalf of Samaria,* Jehoshaphat was collecting  around him a large army, and strengthening himself on the west against  the Philistines and on the south against the Bedawin of the desert.**  The marriage of his eldest son Jehoram*** with Athaliah subsequently  bound the two courts together by still closer ties;**** mutual-visits  were exchanged, and it was on the occasion of a stay made by Jehoshaphat  at Jezreel that the expedition against Eamoth was finally resolved on.         * The subordinate position of Jehoshaphat is clearly       indicated by the reply which he makes to Ahab when the       latter asks him to accompany him on this expedition: \"I am       as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy       horses\" (1 Kings xxii. 4).         ** 1 Kings xvi. 34, where the writer has preserved the       remembrance of a double human sacrifice, destined, according       to the common custom in the whole of the East, to create       guardian spirits for the new building: \"he laid the       foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his firstborn,       and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest       son Segub; according to the word of the Lord.\" [For the       curse pronounced on whoever should rebuild Jericho, see       Josh. vi. 26.--Tr.]         *** [Following the distinction in spelling given in 2 Kings       viii. 25, I have everywhere written Joram (of Israel) and       Jehoram (of Judah), to avoid confusion.--Tr.]         **** Athaliah is sometimes called the daughter of Ahab (2       Kings viii. 18), and sometimes the daughter of Omri (2 Kings       viii. 26; cf. 2 Ohron. xxii. 2), and several authors prefer       the latter filiation, while the majority see in it a mistake       of the Hebrew scribe. It is possible that both attributions       may be correct, for we see by the Assyrian inscriptions that       a sovereign is called the son of the founder of his line       even when he was several generations removed from him: thus,       Merodach-baladan, the adversary of Sargon of Assyria, calls       himself son of Iakin, although the founder of the Bit-Iakin       had been dead many centuries before his accession. The       document used in 2 Kings viii. 26 may have employed the term       daughter of Omri in the same manner merely to indicate that       the Queen of Jerusalem belonged to the house of Omri.    It might well have appeared a more than foolhardy enterprise, and it was  told in Israel that Micaiah, a prophet, the son of Imlah, had predicted  its disastrous ending. \"I saw,\" exclaimed the prophet, \"the Lord sitting  on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and  on His left. And the Lord said, Who shall entice Ahab that he may go up  and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another  said on that manner. And there came forth a spirit, and stood before  the Lord, and said, I will entice him. And the Lord said unto him,  Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in  the mouth of all his prophets. And He said, Thou shalt entice him, and  shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so. Now therefore, behold, the Lord  hafch put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and the  Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.\"*         * 1 Kings xxii. 5-23, reproduced in 2 Chron. xviii. 4-22.    The two kings thereupon invested Ramoth, and Ben-hadad hastened to  the defence of his fortress. Selecting thirty-two of his bravest  charioteers, he commanded them to single out Ahab only for attack, and  not fight with others until they had slain him. This injunction happened  in some way to come to the king's ears, and he therefore disguised  himself as a common soldier, while Jehoshaphat retained his ordinary  dress. Attracted by the richness of the latter's armour, the Syrians  fell upon him, but on his raising his war-cry they perceived their  mistake, and turning from the King of Judah they renewed their quest of  the Israelitish leader. While they were vainly seeking him, an archer  drew a bow \"at a venture,\" and pierced him in the joints of his cuirass.  \"Wherefore he said to his charioteer, Turn thine hand, and carry me  out of the host; for I am sore wounded.\" Perceiving, however, that the  battle was going against him, he revoked the order, and remained on  the field the whole day, supported by his armour-bearers. He expired at  sunset, and the news of his death having spread panic through the ranks,  a cry arose, \"Every man to his city, and every man to his country!\" The  king's followers bore his body to Samaria,* and Israel again relapsed  into the position of a vassal, probably under the same conditions as  before the revolt.         * 1 Kings xxii. 28-38 (cf. 2 Ohron. xviii. 28-34), with       interpolations in verses 35 and 38. It is impossible to       establish the chronology of this period with any certainty,       so entirely do the Hebrew accounts of it differ from the       Assyrian. The latter mention Ahab as alive at the time of       the battle of Qarqar in 854 B.C. and Jehu on the throne in       842 B.C. We must, therefore, place in the intervening twelve       years, first, the end of Ahab's reign; secondly, the two       years of Ahaziah; thirdly, the twelve years of Joram;       fourthly, the beginning of the reign of Jehu--in all,       possibly fourteen years. The reign of Joram has been       prolonged beyond reason by the Hebrew annalists, and it       alone lends itself to be curtailed. Admitting that the siege       of Samaria preceded the battle of Qarqar, we may surmise       that the three years which elapsed, according to the       tradition (1 Kings xxii. 1), between the triumph of Ahab and       his death, fall into two unequal periods, two previous to       Qarqar, and one after it, in such a manner that the revolt       of Israel would have been the result of the defeat of the       Damascenes; Ahab must have died in 835 B.C., as most modern       historians agree. On the other hand, it is scarcely probable       that Jehu ascended the throne at the very moment that       Shalmaneser was defeating Hazael in 842 B.C.; we can only       carry back his accession to the preceding year, possibly       843. The duration of two years for the reign of Ahaziah can       only be reduced by a few months, if indeed as much as that,       as it allows of a full year, and part of a second year (cf.       1 Kings xxii. 51, where it is said that Ahaziah ascended the       throne in the 17th year of Jehoshaphat, and 2 Kings iii. 1,       where it states that Joram of Israel succeeded Ahaziah in       the 18th year of the same Jehoshaphat).; in placing these       two years between 853 and 851, there will remain for the       reign of Joram the period comprised between 851 and 843,       namely, eight years, instead of the twelve attributed to him       by biblical tradition.    Ahaziah survived his father two years, and was succeeded by his brother  Joram.* When Shalmaneser, in 849 B.C., reappeared"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#18)"],[1,"ans;* this, indeed, was excited sooner than he expected, and  perhaps helped to secure to him his throne. During his absence from  Nineveh, a widespread plot had been formed in that city, and on the 20th  day of Tebeth, 681, at the hour when Sennacherib was praying before the  image of his god, two of his sons, Sharezer and Adarmalik (Adrammelech),  assassinated their father at the foot of the altar.**         * A fragment seems to show clearly that the restoration of       the temples was begun even in the lifetime of Sennacherib.         ** We possess three different accounts of the murder of       Sennacherib: 1. In the _Babylonian Chronicle of Pinches_. 2.       In the Bible (2 Kings xix. 36, 37; cf. Isa. xxxvii. 37, 38;       2 Chron. xxxii. 21). 3. In Berosus. The biblical account       alone mentions both murderers; the _Chronicle_ and Berosus       speak of only one, and their testimony seems to prevail with       several historians. I believe that the silence of the       _Chronicle_ and of Berosus is explained by the fact that       Sharezer was chief in the conspiracy, and the one among the       sons who aspired to the kingdom: the second murderer merely       acted for his brother, and consequently had no more right to       be mentioned by name than those accomplices not of the       blood-royal who shared in the murder. The name Sharezer is       usually considered as an abbreviation of the Assyrian name       Nergal-sharuzur, or Assur-sharuzur. Winckler thinks that he       sees in it a corruption of Sharitir, abbreviated from       Sharitir-assur, which he finds as a royal name on a fragment       in the British Museum; he proposes to recognise in this       Sharitir-assur, Sharezer enthroned after his father's death.    One half of the army proclaimed Sharezer king; the northern provinces  espoused his cause; and Esarhaddon must for the moment have lost all  hope of the succession. His father's tragic fate overwhelmed him with  fear and grief; he rent his clothes, groaned and lamented like a lion  roaring, and could be comforted only by the oracles pronounced by  the priests of Babylon. An assurance that the gods favoured his cause  reached him even from Assyria, and Nineveh, after a few weeks of  vacillation, acknowledged him as its sovereign, the rebellion being  mercilessly crushed on the 2nd of Adar.*         * The Bible alone tells us that Sharezer retired to Urartu       (2 Kings xix. 37). To explain the plan of this campaign, it       is usually supposed that at the time of his father's death       Esarhaddon was either beyond Mount Taurus or else on the       Armenian frontier; the sequence of the dates in the       _Babylonian Chronicle of Pinches_, compels me to revert to       the opinion that Esarhaddon marched from Babylon against the       rebels, and pursued them as far as Mount Taurus, and beyond       it to Khanigalbat.    Although this was a considerable advantage to Esarhaddon's cause,  it could not be considered as decisive, since the provinces of the  Euphrates still declared for Sharezer; the gods, therefore, once more  intervened. Ishtar of Arbela had long been considered as the recognised  patroness and oracle of the dynasty. Whether it were a question of a  foreign expedition or a rebellion at home, of a threatened plague or  invasion, of a marriage or an alliance with some powerful neighbour, the  ruling sovereign would invariably have recourse to her, always with the  same formula, to demand counsel of her for the conduct of affairs in  hand, and the replies which she vouchsafed in various ways were  taken into consideration; her will, as expressed by the mouth of her  ministers, would hasten, suspend, or modify the decisions of the king.  Esarhaddon did not neglect to consult the goddess, as well as Assur and  Sin, Shamash, Bel, Nebo, and Nergal; and their words, transcribed upon  a tablet of clay, induced him to act without further delay: \"Go, do not  hesitate, for we march with thee and we will cast down thine enemies!\"  Thus encouraged, he made straight for the scene of danger without  passing through Nineveh, so as to prevent Sharezer and his party having  time to recover. His biographers depict Esarhaddon hurrying forward,  often a day or more in advance of his battalions, without once turning  to see who followed him, and without waiting to allow the horses of his  baggage-waggons to be unharnessed or permitting his servant^ to pitch  his tent; he rested merely for a few moments on the bare ground,  indifferent to the cold and nocturnal frosts of the month of Sebat. It  would appear as if Sharezer had placed his hopes on the Cimmerians, and  had expected their chiefs to come to the rescue. This hypothesis seems  borne out by the fact that the decisive battle took place beyond the  Euphrates and the Taurus, in the country of Khanigalbat. Esarhaddon  attributed his success to Ishtar, the goddess of bravery and of combat;  she alone had broken the weapons of the rebels, she alone had brought  confusion into their lines, and had inclined the hearts of the survivors  to submit. They cried aloud, \"This is our king!\" and Sharezer thereupon  fled into Armenia. The war had been brought to a close with such  rapidity that even the most unsettled of the Assyrian subjects and  vassals had not had time to take advantage of it for their own purposes;  the Kalda on the Persian Gulf, and the Sidonians on the Mediterranean,  were the only two peoples who had openly revolted, and were preparing  to enter on a struggle to preserve their independence thus once more  regained. Yet the events of the preceding months had shaken the power  of Nineveh more seriously than we should at first suppose. For the first  time since the accession of Tiglath-pileser III. the almost inevitable  troubles which accompany the change of a sovereign had led to an open  war. The vast army of Sargon and Sennacherib had been split up, and the  two factions into which it was divided, commanded as they were by  able generals and composed of troops accustomed to conquer, must have  suffered more keenly in an engagement with each other than in the course  of an ordinary campaign against a common enemy. One part at least of the  military staff had become disorganised; regiments had been decimated,  and considerable contingents were required to fill the vacancies in the  ranks. The male population of Assyria, suddenly called on to furnish the  necessary effective force, could not supply the demand without drawing  too great a proportion of men from the country; and one of those crises  of exhaustion was imminent which come upon a nation after an undue  strain, often causing its downfall in the midst of its success, and  yielding it an easy prey to the wiles of its adversaries.*         * The information we possess concerning Esarhaddon is       gathered from: 1. _The Insertion of Cylinders A, B, C_, the       second of the three better known as the _Broken Cylinder_.       These texts contain a summary of the king's wars, in which       the subject-matter is arranged geographically, not       chronologically: they cease with the _eponymy_ of Akhazilu,       i.e. the year 673. 2. Some mutilated fragments, of the       _Annals_. 3. _The Blade Stone of Aberdeen_, on which the       account of the rebuilding of Babylon is given. 4. _The Stele       of Zindjirli_. 5. The consultations of the god Shamash by       Esarhaddon in different circumstances of his reign. 6. A       considerable number of small inscriptions and some tablets.       The classification of the events of this reign presents       serious difficulties, which have been partly overcome by       passages in the _Babylonian Chronicle of Pinches_.    Esarhaddon was personally inclined for peace, and as soon as he was  established on the throne he gave orders that the building works, which  had been suspended during the late troubles, should be resumed and  actively pushed forward; but the unfortunate disturbances of the  times did not permit of his pursuing his favourite occupation without  interruption, and, like those of his warlike predecessors, his life was  passed almost entirely on the field of battle. Babylon, grateful for  what he had done for her, tendered him an unbroken fidelity throughout  the stormy episodes of his reign, and showed her devotion to him by an  unwavering obedience. The Kalda received no support from that quarter,  and were obliged to bear the whole burden of the war which they had  provoked. Their chief, Nabu-ziru-kinish-lishir, who had been placed  over them by Sennacherib, now harassed the cities of Karduniash, and  Ningal-shumiddin, the prefect of Uru, demanded immediate help from  Assyria. Esarhaddon at once despatched such a considerable force that  the Kaldu chief did not venture to meet it in the open field, and after  a few unimportant skirmishes he gave up the struggle, and took refuge in  Elam. Khumban-khaldash, had died there in 680, a few months before  the murder of Sennacherib, and his son, a second Khumban-khaldash, had  succeeded him; this prince appears either to have shared the peaceful  tastes of his brother-king of Assyria, or more probably did not feel  himself sufficiently secure of his throne to risk the chance of coming  into collision with his neighbour. He caused Nabu-ziru-kinish-lishir to  be slain, and Naid-marduk, the other son of Merodach-baladan, who had  shared his brother's flight, was so terrified at his murder that he at  once sought refuge in Nineveh; he was reinstated in his paternal  domain on condition of paying a tribute, and, faithful to his oath of  allegiance, he thenceforward came yearly in person to bring his dues and  pay homage to his sovereign (679). The Kalda rising had, in short, been  little more than a skirmish, and the chastisement of the Sidonians would  have involved neither time nor trouble, had not the desultory movements  of the barbarians obliged the Assyrians"]]]
