At recess there was more grouping and whispering, and Grace was puzzled  and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were  ignored. Such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the  previous year.    \"Eleanor started that paper, whatever it is,\" said Nora O'Malley to the  Phi Sigma Tau, who stood in a group around her desk. \"She was here when  I came in this morning, and I was early, too. It is some masterpiece of  mischief on her part, or she wouldn't take the trouble to get here on  time.\"    \"Here comes Mabel,\" said Jessica. \"Maybe she has seen the paper. Mabel,  dear, did you see that paper that has been going the rounds this  morning?\"    Mabel nodded.    \"What was written on it, Mabel?\" asked Grace curiously.    Mabel looked distressed for a moment then she said, \"I wish I might  tell you all about it, but I gave my word of honor before I read it  that I wouldn't mention the contents to any one.\"    \"Then, of course, we won't ask you,\" said Anne Pierson quickly. \"But  tell us this much--is it about any of us?\"    \"No,\" replied Mabel. \"It isn't. It is something I was asked to sign.\"    \"And did you sign it?\" asked Jessica.    \"I certainly did not,\" responded Mabel. \"It was----\" she stopped, then  flushed. She had been on the point of telling. \"I am sorry I ever saw  it,\" she continued. \"I can't bear to have secrets and not tell you.\"    \"That's all right, Mabel,\" said Marian Barber, patting her on the  shoulder. \"We don't want you to tell. If it doesn't concern us we don't  care, do we, girls?\"    \"No, indeed,\" was the reply.    Just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with  the riddle still unsolved. Nothing more was seen of the mysterious  paper, and Grace came to the conclusion that it had been nothing  important, after all.    On Wednesday, aside from a little more whispering and significant  glances exchanged among the pupils, not a ripple disturbed the calm of  the study hall. It was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant  surprise when Miss Thompson walked into the room, dismissed the senior  class and requested the three lower classes to remain in their seats.    After the seniors had quietly left the study hall, Miss Thompson stood  gravely regarding the rows of girls before her. Her eyes wandered toward  where Eleanor sat, looking bored and indifferent, and then she looked  toward Grace, whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face  with respectful attention.    \"I don't believe Grace is guilty, at any rate,\" thought Miss Thompson;  then she addressed the assembled girls.    \"Something has come to my ears, girls,\" said the principal, \"that I find  hard to credit, but before you leave here this afternoon I must know who  is innocent and who is guilty.\"    Miss Thompson paused and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their  seats, while a few glanced quickly toward Eleanor, who was looking  straight ahead, the picture of innocence.    \"You all know,\" continued the principal, \"that it is strictly forbidden  for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending  a circus, matinee or any public performance of this nature. I have so  severely disciplined pupils for this offence that for a long time no one  has disobeyed me. I was, therefore, astonished to learn that a number of  girls, regardless of rules, have taken matters into their own hands and  have decided to absent themselves from school to-morrow in order to  attend the matinee to be given in the theatre. Such a decision is worse  than disobedience--it is lawlessness. Unless a severe example is made of  the offenders, the standard of the school will be lowered. Therefore,  I intend to sift this matter to the bottom and find out what mischievous  influence prompted this act of insubordination.    \"Report says that this movement originated in the junior class, and that  a paper has been circulated and signed by certain pupils, who pledged  themselves to play truant and attend the matinee to-morrow.\"    The eyes of Grace and her chums turned questioningly toward Mabel  Allison, who nodded slightly in the affirmative.    So that was what all the whispering and mystery had meant. Grace  inwardly congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing.  None of her friends were implicated, either. Even Mabel had refused to  sign.    \"I have dismissed the senior class, because I have been assured of their  entire ignorance of the plot. What I insist upon knowing now, is who are  the real culprits, beginning with the girl who originated the paper to  the last one who signed it. I am going to put every girl on her honor,  and I expect absolutely truthful answers. The girls who signed the paper  I have mentioned will rise.\"    There was a moment of suspense, then Eleanor Savell proudly rose from  her seat. Her example was followed, until two thirds of the girls  present were standing. The principal stood silently regarding them with  an expression of severity that was decidedly discomfitting.    \"That will do,\" she said curtly, after they had stood for what seemed  to them an age, but was really only a couple of minutes.    \"You may be seated. The girl who composed and wrote that agreement will  now rise and explain herself.\"    Without hesitating, Eleanor rose and regarded the principal with an  insolent smile. \"I wrote it, Miss Thompson,\" she said clearly. \"I wrote  it because I wished to. I am sorry you found out about it, because it  has spoiled all our fun.\"    There was a gasp of horror at Eleanor's assertion. No one had ever  before spoken so disrespectfully to their revered principal.    \"Miss Savell,\" said the principal quietly, although her flashing eyes  and set lips showed that she was very angry, \"if you have that paper in  your possession, bring it to me at once, and never answer me again as  you did just now. You are both disrespectful and impertinent.\"    But Miss Thompson's anger toward Eleanor was nothing compared with the  tempest that the principal had aroused in Eleanor. The latter flushed,  then turned perfectly white with rage. Still standing, she reached down,  picked up a book from her desk and took from it a paper. \"This,\" she  said, in a low tense voice, \"is the paper you wish to see. I do not  choose to let you see it, therefore I shall destroy it.\"    [Illustration: \"I Do Not Choose to Let You See This Paper.\"]    Then she deliberately tore the offending paper into shreds and scattered  them broadcast.    \"I hope you understand that I am not afraid of you or any other teacher  in this school,\" she continued. \"I have never been punished in my life,  therefore I am not liable to give you the first opportunity. I despise  you, because you are a ridiculous prig, and I am glad of an opportunity  to tell you so. As for the persons who told you about our plan, words  cannot express my contempt for them, and right here I accuse Grace  Harlowe and her sorority of getting the information from Mabel Allison  yesterday and carrying it to you. They are all tale-bearers and sneaks.\"    With these words, Eleanor angrily flung the book she held on the desk  and walked down the aisle toward the door, but Miss Thompson barred her  way.    \"Stop, Miss Savell,\" she commanded. \"You shall not leave this room until  you have apologized to the girls whom you have unjustly accused and to  me. I will not tolerate such behavior.\"    Eleanor glared at the principal, whose face was rigid in its purpose,  then sank into the nearest vacant seat, saying defiantly: \"You may keep  me here all night if you like, but, I meant what I said, and I shall  retract nothing.\"    Nevertheless she did not again attempt to leave the room. She had met  with a will stronger than her own and she realized it.    Ignoring Eleanor's final remark, Miss Thompson once more turned her  attention to the matter in hand.    \"Those girls who are not in any way implicated in this matter are  dismissed,\" she said.    About one third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall,  the Phi Sigma Tau being among the number. Grace motioned the girls to  hurry. She wished to leave the room with her friends before Miss  Thompson noticed them. She knew the principal would insist on an apology  from Eleanor, and neither she nor her friends wished it. For the first  time since Eleanor had chosen to cut their acquaintance Grace was  thoroughly angry with her. She could not forgive Eleanor for having  accused her and her friends of carrying tales before almost the entire  school; therefore a forced apology would not appease her wounded pride.  She drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the  study hall door.    \"Hurry up,\" she said. \"We'll talk when we get outside school. Don't stop  for a minute. If Miss Thompson notices that we are gone, she'll send  after us.\"    The girls silently donned their wraps and fled from the building like  fugitives from justice. Once on the street a lively confab ensued, all  talking at once.    \"Let's take turns talking,\" cried Grace, laughing. \"We shall understand  each other a little better.\"    \"Now, what do you think of Miss Eleanor?\" cried Nora. \"She has certainly  shown her true colors this time.\"    \"I never heard of anything more unjust than the way she accused us, when  we knew nothing about her old plan,\" said Marian Barber.    \"It was abominable,\" said Eva Allen.    The other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms.    \"I suppose it did look as though I told you girls,\" said Mabel Allison,  who had joined them at the gate. \"You know I was with you at recess,  right after the paper had been passed to me. I don't think Miss Savell  intended me to see it. It was passed to me by mistake.\"    \"Very likely,\" agreed Grace. \"I wonder who did tell Miss"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17860"],[0,"Stories from Hans Andersen (#18)"],[1,"the Emperor. 'By wearing them  I should be able to discover which men in my kingdom are unfitted for  their posts. I shall distinguish the wise men from the fools. Yes, I  certainly must order some of that stuff to be woven for me.'    He paid the two swindlers a lot of money in advance so that they might  begin their work at once.    They did put up two looms and pretended to weave, but they had nothing  whatever upon their shuttles. At the outset they asked for a quantity of  the finest silk and the purest gold thread, all of which they put into  their own bags, while they worked away at the empty looms far into the  night.    'I should like to know how those weavers are getting on with the stuff,'  thought the Emperor; but he felt a little queer when he reflected that  any one who was stupid or unfit for his post would not be able to see  it. He certainly thought that he need have no fears for himself, but  still he thought he would send somebody else first to see how it was  getting on. Everybody in the town knew what wonderful power the stuff  possessed, and every one was anxious to see how stupid his neighbour  was.    'I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,' thought the  Emperor. 'He will be best able to see how the stuff looks, for he is a  clever man, and no one fulfils his duties better than he does!'    So the good old minister went into the room where the two swindlers sat  working at the empty loom.    'Heaven preserve us!' thought the old minister, opening his eyes very  wide. 'Why, I can't see a thing!' But he took care not to say so.    Both the swindlers begged him to be good enough to step a little nearer,  and asked if he did not think it a good pattern and beautiful colouring.  They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister stared as hard  as he could, but he could not see anything, for of course there was  nothing to see.    'Good heavens!' thought he, 'is it possible that I am a fool. I have  never thought so, and nobody must know it. Am I not fit for my post? It  will never do to say that I cannot see the stuffs.'    'Well, sir, you don't say anything about the stuff,' said the one who  was pretending to weave.    'Oh, it is beautiful! quite charming!' said the old minister, looking  through his spectacles; 'this pattern and these colours! I will  certainly tell the Emperor that the stuff pleases me very much.'    'We are delighted to hear you say so,' said the swindlers, and then they  named all the colours and described the peculiar pattern. The old  minister paid great attention to what they said, so as to be able to  repeat it when he got home to the Emperor.    [Illustration: _They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old  minister stared as hard as he could, but he could not see anything, for  of course there was nothing to see._]    Then the swindlers went on to demand more money, more silk, and  more gold, to be able to proceed with the weaving; but they put it all  into their own pockets--not a single strand was ever put into the loom,  but they went on as before weaving at the empty loom.    The Emperor soon sent another faithful official to see how the stuff was  getting on, and if it would soon be ready. The same thing happened to  him as to the minister; he looked and looked, but as there was only the  empty loom, he could see nothing at all.    'Is not this a beautiful piece of stuff?' said both the swindlers,  showing and explaining the beautiful pattern and colours which were not  there to be seen.    'I know I am not a fool!' thought the man, 'so it must be that I am  unfit for my good post! It is very strange, though! However, one must  not let it appear!' So he praised the stuff he did not see, and assured  them of his delight in the beautiful colours and the originality of the  design. 'It is absolutely charming!' he said to the Emperor. Everybody  in the town was talking about this splendid stuff.    Now the Emperor thought he would like to see it while it was still on  the loom. So, accompanied by a number of selected courtiers, among whom  were the two faithful officials who had already seen the imaginary  stuff, he went to visit the crafty impostors, who were working away as  hard as ever they could at the empty loom.    'It is magnificent!' said both the honest officials. 'Only see, your  Majesty, what a design! What colours!' And they pointed to the empty  loom, for they thought no doubt the others could see the stuff.    'What!' thought the Emperor; 'I see nothing at all! This is terrible! Am  I a fool? Am I not fit to be Emperor? Why, nothing worse could happen to  me!'    'Oh, it is beautiful!' said the Emperor. 'It has my highest approval!'  and he nodded his satisfaction as he gazed at the empty loom. Nothing  would induce him to say that he could not see anything.    The whole suite gazed and gazed, but saw nothing more than all the  others. However, they all exclaimed with his Majesty, 'It is very  beautiful!' and they advised him to wear a suit made of this wonderful  cloth on the occasion of a great procession which was just about to take  place. 'It is magnificent! gorgeous! excellent!' went from mouth to  mouth; they were all equally delighted with it. The Emperor gave each of  the rogues an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and  the title of 'Gentlemen weavers.'    [Illustration: _Then the emperor walked along in the procession under  the gorgeous canopy, and everybody in the streets and at the windows  exclaimed, 'How beautiful the Emperor's new clothes are!'_]    The swindlers sat up the whole night, before the day on which the  procession was to take place, burning sixteen candles; so that people  might see how anxious they were to get the Emperor's new clothes ready.  They pretended to take the stuff off the loom. They cut it out in the  air with a huge pair of scissors, and they stitched away with  needles without any thread in them. At last they said: 'Now the  Emperor's new clothes are ready!'    The Emperor, with his grandest courtiers, went to them himself, and both  the swindlers raised one arm in the air, as if they were holding  something, and said: 'See, these are the trousers, this is the coat,  here is the mantle!' and so on. 'It is as light as a spider's web. One  might think one had nothing on, but that is the very beauty of it!'    'Yes!' said all the courtiers, but they could not see anything, for  there was nothing to see.    'Will your imperial majesty be graciously pleased to take off your  clothes,' said, the impostors, 'so that we may put on the new ones,  along here before the great mirror?'    The Emperor took off all his clothes, and the impostors pretended to  give him one article of dress after the other of the new ones which they  had pretended to make. They pretended to fasten something round his  waist and to tie on something; this was the train, and the Emperor  turned round and round in front of the mirror.    'How well his majesty looks in the new clothes! How becoming they are!'  cried all the people round. 'What a design, and what colours! They are  most gorgeous robes!'    'The canopy is waiting outside which is to be carried over your majesty  in the procession,' said the master of the ceremonies.    'Well, I am quite ready,' said the Emperor. 'Don't the clothes fit  well?' and then he turned round again in front of the mirror, so that he  should seem to be looking at his grand things.    The chamberlains who were to carry the train stooped and pretended to  lift it from the ground with both hands, and they walked along with  their hands in the air. They dared not let it appear that they could not  see anything.    Then the Emperor walked along in the procession under the gorgeous  canopy, and everybody in the streets and at the windows exclaimed, 'How  beautiful the Emperor's new clothes are! What a splendid train! And they  fit to perfection!' Nobody would let it appear that he could see  nothing, for then he would not be fit for his post, or else he was a  fool.    None of the Emperor's clothes had been so successful before.    'But he has got nothing on,' said a little child.    'Oh, listen to the innocent,' said its father; and one person whispered  to the other what the child had said. 'He has nothing on; a child says  he has nothing on!'    'But he has nothing on!' at last cried all the people.    The Emperor writhed, for he knew it was true, but he thought 'the  procession must go on now,' so held himself stiffer than ever, and the  chamberlains held up the invisible train.          THE WIND'S TALE    ABOUT WALDEMAR DAA AND HIS DAUGHTERS      When the wind sweeps across a field of grass it makes little ripples in  it like a lake; in a field of corn it makes great waves like the sea  itself: this is the wind's frolic. Then listen to the stories it tells;  it sings them aloud, one kind of song among the trees of the forest, and  a very different one when it is pent up within walls with all their  cracks and crannies. Do you see how the wind chases the white fleecy  clouds as if they were a flock of sheep? Do you hear the wind down  there, howling in the open doorway like a watchman winding his horn?  Then, too, how he whistles in the chimneys, making the fire crackle and  sparkle. How cosy it is to sit in the warm glow of the fire listening to  the tales it has to tell! Let the wind tell its own story! It can tell  you more adventures than all of us put together. Listen now:--    'Whew!--Whew!--Fare away!' That was the refrain of his song.    'Close to the Great Belt stands an old mansion with thick red walls,'  says the wind. 'I know every stone of it; I knew them before when they  formed part of Marsk Stig's Castle on the Ness. It had to come down. The  stones were used again, and made a new wall of a new castle in another  place--Borreby Hall as it now stands.
