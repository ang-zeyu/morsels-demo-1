In  Figure 5, the apparatus is seen from the side; c.h. is called the (right)  anterior cornu** of the hyoid. The function of the hyoid apparatus in  the frog is to furnish, a basis of attachment to the tongue muscles; it  remains cartilaginous, with the exception of the relic of one branchial  arch, which ossifies as the thyro-hyal (Figure 7 th.h.). It will be noted  that, as development proceeds, the angle of the jaw swings backward,  and the hyoid apparatus, shifts relatively forward. These changes of  position are indicated in Figure 8, III., by little arrow-heads.    * We may note here that, comparing the ear of the frog with that of the  rabbit, there is no external ear. There is, moreover, no bulla supporting  the middle ear, and the tympanic membrane stretches between the  squamosal in front and the anterior cornu of the hyoid behind. A  rod-like columella auris replaces the chain of ear ossicles, and may,  or may not, answer to the stapes alone, or even possibly to the entire  series. In the internal ear there is no cochlea, and the otic mass is  largely cartilaginous instead of entirely bony.    ** Plural cornua.      Section 29. Before proceeding to the comparison of the mammalian  skull with this, we would strongly recommend the student thoroughly  to master this portion of the work, and in no way can he do this more  thoroughly and quickly than by taking a parboiled frog, picking off the  skin, muscle, and connective tissue from its skull, and making out the  various bones with the help of our diagrams.      Section 30. Figure 9 represents, in the most diagrammatic way, the  main changes in form of the essential constituents of the cranio-facial  apparatus, as we pass from the amphibian to the mammalian skull. F.  is the frog from the side and behind; b.c. is the brain-case, o.c. the  otic capsule, e. the eye, n.c. the nasal capsule, p.p. the  palato-pterygoid cartilage, mx. the maxillary membrane bones, sq.  the squamosal, and mb. the mandible. The student should compare  with Figure 5, and convince himself that he appreciates the  diagrammatic rendering of these parts. Now all the distinctive  differences in form, from this of the dog's skull (D.), are reducible to  two primary causes--       (1) The brain is enormously larger, and the brain-case is vastly     inflated, so that--          (a) the otic capsule becomes embedded in the brain-case wall;          (b) the palato-pterygoid rod lies completely underneath the        brain-case instead of laterally to it;          (c) the squamosal tilts down and in, instead of down and out,        and the lower jaw articulates with its outer surface instead        of below its inner, and, moreover, with the enormous distention        of the brain-case it comes about that the squamosal is        incorporated with its wall.       (2) The maxilla anteriorly and the palatine posteriorly send down     palatine plates that grow in to form the bony palate, cutting off     a nasal passage (n.p.) from the mouth cavity (m.p.), and carrying the     posterior nares from the front part of the mouth, as they are in the     frog, to the pharynx. Hence the vomers of the dog lie, not in the     ceiling of the mouth, but in the floor of this nasal passage.      Section 31. The quadrate cartilage of the frog is superseded by the  squamosal as the suspensorium of the lower jaw. It is greatly  reduced, therefore; but it is not entirely absent. In the young mammal,  a quadrate cartilage can be traced, connected with the  palato-pterygoid cartilage, and articulating with Meckel's cartilage. Its  position is, of course, beneath the squamosal, and just outside the  otic capsule. As development proceeds, the increase in size of the  quadrate, does not keep pace with that of the skull structures. It loses  its connection with the palato-pterygoid, and apparently ossifies as a  small ossicle-- the incus of the middle ear. A small nodule of  cartilage, cut off from the proximal end of Meckel's cartilage, becomes  the malleus. The stapes would appear to be derived from the hyoid  arch. Hence these small bones seem to be the relics of the discarded  jaw suspensorium of the frog utilized in a new function. Considerable  doubt, however, attaches to this interpretation-- doubt that, if anything,  is gaining ground.      Section 32. The tympanic bulla of the dog is not indicated in Diagram  9, and it would appear to be a new structure (neomorph), not  represented in the frog.      Section 33. Besides these great differences in form, there are  important differences in the amount and distribution of centres of  ossification of the skull of frog and mammal. There is no  parasphenoid in the mammal*; and, instead, a complete series of  ossifications, the median-, basi-, and pre-sphenoids, and the lateral  ali- and orbito-sphenoids occur. The points can be rendered much  more luminously in a diagram than in the text, and we would counsel  the student to compare this very carefully with that of the Rabbit.    * Faint vestigeal indications occur in the developing skulls of some  insectivora.

(2) The several constituents of the lower jaw are not to be     distinguished in the adult mammal.       (3) The frog has no lachrymal bone.      Section 36. We are now in a position to notice, without any danger of  misconception, what is called the segmental theory of the skull. Older  anatomists, working from adult structure only, conceived the idea that  the brain-case of the mammal represented three inflated vertebrae.  The most anterior had the pre-sphenoid for its body, the  orbito-sphenoids for its neural processes, and the arch was  completed above by the frontals (frontal segment). Similarly, the  basi-sphenoids, ali-sphenoids, and parietals formed a second arch  (parietal segment), and the ex-, basi-, and supra-occipitals a third  (occipital segment). If this were correct, in the frog, which is a more  primitive rendering of the vertebrate plan, we should find the vertebral  characters more distinct. But, as a matter of fact, as the student will  perceive, frontal segment, parietal segment, and occipital segment,  can no longer be traced; and the mode of origin from trabeculae and  para-chordals show very clearly the falsity of this view. The vertebrate  cranium is entirely different in nature from vertebrae. The origin of the  parietals and frontals as paired bones in membrane reinforces this  conclusion.      Section 37. But as certainly as we have no such metameric  segmentation, as this older view implies, in the brain-case of the frog,  so quite as certainly is metameric segmentation evident in its  branchial arches. We have the four gill slits of the tadpole and their  bars repeating one another; the hyoid bar in front of these is evidently  of a similar nature; and that the ear drum is derived from an  imperforate gill slit is enforced by the presence of an open slit (the  spiracle) in the rays and dog-fish in an entirely equivalent position.  Does the mouth answer to a further pair of gill slits, and is the jaw  arch (palato-pterygoid + Meckel's cartilage) equivalent to the arches  that come behind it? This question has been asked, and answered in  the affirmative, by many morphologists, but not by any means by all.  The cranial nerves have a curious similarity of arrangement with regard  to the gill slits and the mouth; the fifth nerve forks over the mouth, the  seventh forks over the ear drum, the ninth, in the tadpole and fish,  forks over the first branchial slit, and the tenth is, as it were, a leash  of nerves, each forking over one of the remaining gill slits. But this  matter will be more intelligible when the student has worked over a  fish type, and need not detain us any further now.      Section 38. See also Section 13 again, in which is the suggestion  that the occipital part of the skull is possibly a fusion of vertebrae, a  new view with much in its favour, and obviously an entirely different  one from the old \"segmental\" view of the entire skull, discussed in  Section 36.      _Questions on the Frog_       [All these questions were actually set at London University     Examinations.] {In Both Editions.}    1. Give an account, with illustrative sketches, of the digestive organs  of the common frog, specifying particularly the different forms of  epithelium met with in the several regions thereof.    2. Describe the heart of a frog, and compare it with that of a fish and  of a mammal, mentioning in each case the great vessels which open  into each cavity.    3. Compare with one another the breathing organs and the  mechanism of respiration in a frog and in a rabbit. Give figures  showing the condition of the heart and great arteries in these animals,  and indicate in each case the nature of the blood in the several  cavities of the heart.    4. Draw diagrams, with the parts named, illustrating the arrangement  of the chief arteries of (a) the frog, (b) the rabbit. (c) Compare briefly  the arrangements thus described.
