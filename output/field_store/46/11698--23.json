But before I enter upon a detail  of those politics, of which you will find that I understand something,  allow me to continue the history of my presentation, and also to give  some account of Christian VII.    You know that his Danish majesty was expected with anything but pleasure  by the king of France, and with curiosity by the rest of the nation. Men  and women were impatient to see a king, under twenty years of age, who  was traversing Europe with a design of attaining instruction. Married  to a lovely woman, Caroline Mathilde, he had left her on the instant,  without suspecting that this separation would prove fatal to both. At  Paris, the real character of this prince was not known, but a confused  report of his gallantry was spread abroad, on which all the courtesans  of note in the city began to try all arts to please him, each hoping  to attract him to herself, and dip into his strong box. M. de Sartines  amused us one evening, the king and myself, by telling us of the plans  of these ladies. Some were going to meet his Danish majesty, others  were to await him at the barrier, and two of the most renowned,  mesdemoiselles Gradi and Laprairie, had their portraits painted, to send  to the young monarch as soon as he should arrive.    Christian VII entered Paris the latter end of the month of October,  1768. MM. de Duras complimented him in the king's name, and informed him  that they were charged with the office of receiving his commands during  his residence in Paris. The interview of the king and the illustrious  stranger took place at Versailles. Christian VII came thither in the  state-carriage, and was conducted by the duc de Duras into the apartment  of the dauphin, where he remained until Louis XV was prepared to receive  him. I had heard much discussion about this reception. It was said, that  to make a distinction between sovereign of a petty state and that of the  superb kingdom of France, it was requisite that the former should await  for some time the audience which the latter accorded. I am sure that  when the peace with Frederick was agitated, the face of Louis XV was not  more grave and serious than during this puerile debate about etiquette.    The duc de Choiseul, who had the control of foreign affairs, was in the  apartment to receive his Danish majesty, with his colleagues, the duc  de Praslin, the comte de Saint-Florentin (whom I have called by  anticipation duc de la Vrilliere), M. Bertin, M. Mainon d'Invau,  controller of the finances, and M. de Jarente, bishop of Orleans and  one of the ministry. He kept himself somewhat in the background, as  tho' from humility. The duc de Choiseul came up to him, and said, with a  smile,    \"Monseigneur, what brings you in contact with a heretic?\"    \"To watch for the moment of penitence.\"    \"But what will you do if it become necessary to teach him his _credo_?\"    M. de Jarente understood the joke, and was the first to jest upon his  own unepiscopal conduct, replying to the duc de Choiseul,    \"There is a person present who knows it; he will whisper it to me, and,  if necessary, the _Veni Creator_ also.\"    The king of Denmark was congratulated by the duc de Choiseul,  who discharged this duty with as much grace as wit. Afterwards M.  Desgranges, master of the ceremonies, having announced that Louis XV was  visible, the king of Denmark, preceded by his gentlemen and the French  ministers and lords, went to the king's cabinet, in which two arm-chairs  precisely alike were prepared, but his majesty of Denmark positively  refused to be seated. He entered into conversation, and felicitated  himself on seeing a monarch, whose renown filled Europe, and whom  he should take as his model. During this conversation Christian VII  displayed the greatest amiability. Our king, speaking to him, said, \"I  am old enough to be your father\"; to which he replied, \"All my conduct  towards you shall be that of a son.\" This was thought admirable; and  at the termination of the interview Louis XV appeared charmed with his  brother of Denmark. \"He is a complete Frenchman,\" said he to me, \"and I  should be sorry if he left me dissatisfied.\"    That same evening Christian VII visited monseigneur the dauphin, in whom  he did not find the urbanity of his grandfather. The conversation was  short and abridged out of regard to our prince, who only stammered,  without being able to find one polished phrase. Never was there in his  youth a more timid and awkwardly conducted prince than the present king.  I shall mention him and his brothers hereafter, but will now direct my  immediate attention to the king of Denmark. He supped the same evening  with Louis XV at a table with four and twenty ladies of the court,  selected from amongst those most celebrated for the charms of their  persons or their wit. As his Danish majesty was greatly struck with  madame de Flaracourt, the king asked him how old the lady might be in  his opinion.    \"Thirty, perhaps,\" was the reply.    \"Thirty, brother! she is fifty.\"    \"Then age has no influence at your court.\" I shall not copy the  \"_Gazette de France_\" to tell you of the sojourn of Christian VII at  Paris. I am not writing the journal of this prince but of myself. The  king one day said to me,    \"My brother of Denmark has expressed to the duc de Duras a great desire  to pay his respects to you, if you will accede to his wishes. I leave  you entirely sovereign mistress of yourself, not without some fear  however that the young king will steal away your heart from me.\"    \"Ah, sire,\" I replied, \"that is an unjust suspicion; I should be angry  about it if it were not a joke, and would refuse to see the king of  Denmark did I not know how fully you are assured of my attachment to  you.\"    \"I should not be so jealous, madame, if I did not set so much value on  it,\" was the reply of the king, as he kissed my hand.    The duc de Duras came the next day to inform me of the request of his  new king. It was agreed, in order to keep the interview secret, that  I should receive him at my own mansion in the Rue de la Jussienne,  and that he should come there without suite, and with the strictest  incognito. At the day and hour agreed he entered my house, escorting two  strangers of admirable presence. One was the king of Denmark, under  the name of comte de ------, and the other a nobleman of his suite.  Christian VII appeared to me a very handsome man. He had large and  singularly expressive eyes; too much so, perhaps, for their brilliancy  was not of good augury; and I was not surprised at hearing subsequently  that his reason had abandoned him, altho' he possessed and exerted his  wit most perfectly during our conversation, in which he displayed the  greatest gallantry. I could not reproach him with one single expression  that was objectionable, altho' the subject of conversation was delicate.  He discoursed of the feelings of the king towards me, and yet said not a  word that was unsuited or out of place, nothing but what was in the best  taste, and expressed with the utmost delicacy. I asked him if the ladies  of Denmark were handsome. \"I thought, madame,\" was his reply, \"until  now, that the ladies of my kingdom were the most lovely in Europe.\"    We did not talk of myself only: Christian VII spoke of Paris with  enthusiasm. \"It is the capital of the world,\" he remarked, \"and our  states are but the provinces.\" He sought out our most celebrated  _savants_ and _literati_, and was particularly delighted with  d'Alembert, Diderot, la Harpe, and M. the comte de Buffon. He greatly  regretted that Voltaire was not in Paris, and expressed his great desire  to see at Ferney the great genius (as he termed him) who instructed and  amused the world. He appeared weary of the fetes which were given,  and especially with the deadly-lively company of the two Duras. It was  enough to kill you to have only one of them, and you may imagine the  torture of being bored with both. The duke had promised Louis XV to be  as amusing as possible too! After a conversation of three hours, which  his majesty (of course) said had appeared but of a moment, he left me  delighted with his person, wit, and manners.    When Louis XV saw me, he inquired my opinion of his Danish majesty.    \"He is,\" I replied, \"a well-educated king, and that they say is a  rarity.\"    \"True,\" said Louis XV, \"there are so many persons who are interested in  our ignorance, that it is a miracle if we escape out of their hands as  reasonable beings.\"    I went on to tell the king our conversation.    \"Ah,\" cried he, \"here is one who will increase the vanity of the  literary tribe: they want it, certainly. All these wits are our natural  born enemies; and think themselves above us; and the more we honor them,  the greater right do they assume to censure and despise us.\"    This was the usual burden of his song: he hated men of learning.  Voltaire especially was his detestation, on account of the numerous  epigrams which this great man had written against him; and Voltaire  had just given fresh subject of offence by publishing \"_La Cour du Roi  Petaud_\" (\"The Court of the King Petaud,\") a satire evidently directed  as strongly against the king as your humble servant. M. de Voltaire had  doubtless been encouraged to write this libel by the Choiseul party.  He was at a distance, judged unfavorably of me, and thought he could  scourge me without compromising himself.    It was comte Jean who brought me these verses, in which there was less  poetry than malevolence. I read them, was indignant, and wept. The duc  d'Aiguillon came, and finding me in tears, inquired the cause.    \"Here,\" said I, giving him the poem, \"see if you can bear so gross an  insult.\" He took the paper, cast his eyes over it, and having folded it  up, put it into his pocket.  \"It was ill done,\" said he, \"to show this to you.  I knew of it  yesterday, and came now "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#18)"],[1,"circle opened and the hewn plank, standing upright on a small Navajo  blanket, without any apparent prop or support, was disclosed to view. At  the base of the plank was the basket holding the figure of the sun.  Singing was continued and so were the uproarious cries of  \"ThÃ²hay\"--cries anxious, cries appealing, cries commanding--while the  bearer of the rattle stood facing the pole and rattling vigorously at  it. At length, seemingly in obedience to all this clamor, the solar  image left the basket and slowly, falteringly, totteringly, ascended the  plank to within a few inches of the top. Here it stopped a moment and  then descended in the same manner in which it rose. Once more was it  made to rise and set, when the circle of dancers again closed, the  plank, sun, and basket were taken in custody, and the dancers departed.  Taking into consideration the limited knowledge and rude implements of  the originators (for this alili is not of modern origin), this was a  well performed trick. The means used for supporting the pole and pulling  up the sun could not be detected. The dancers formed a semicircle nearly  ten feet distant from the pole and the light of the central fire shone  brightly upon all.    143. _Ninth dance._ It was after 1 o'clock in the morning when the dance  of the hoshkÃ wn (_Yucca baccata_) began. (Fig. 57. See paragraph 3.)  The ceremony was conducted in the first part by twenty-two persons in  ordinary dress. One bore, exposed to view, a natural root of yucca,  crowned with its cluster of root leaves, which remain green all winter.  The rest bore in their hands wands of piÃ±on. What other properties they  may have had concealed under their blankets the reader will soon be able  to conjecture. On their third journey around the fire they halted in the  west and formed a close circle for the purpose of concealing their  operations, such as was made in the eighth dance. After a minute spent  in singing and many repetitions of \"ThÃ²hay,\" the circle opened,  disclosing to our view the yucca root planted in the sand. Again the  circle closed; again the song, the rattle, and the chorus of \"ThÃ²hay\"  were heard, and when the circle was opened the second time an excellent  counterfeit of the small budding flower stalk was seen amid the fascicle  of leaves. A third time the dancers formed their ring of occultation;  after the song and din had continued for a few seconds the circle parted  for the third time, when, all out of season, the great panicle of creamy  yucca flowers gleamed in the firelight. The previous transformations of  the yucca had been greeted with approving shouts and laughter; the  blossoms were hailed with storms of applause. For the fourth and last  time the circle closed, and when again it opened the blossoms had  disappeared and the great, dark green fruit hung in abundance from the  pedicels. When the last transformation was completed the dancers went  once more around the fire and departed, leaving the fruitful yucca  behind them.      [Illustration: FIG. 57. Yucca baccata.]    144. In a moment after they had disappeared the form of one personating  an aged, stupid, short sighted, decrepit man was seen to emerge slowly  from among the crowd of spectators in the east. He was dressed in an old  and woefully ragged suit and wore a high, pointed hat. His face was  whitened and he bore a short, crooked, wooden bow and a few crooked, ill  made arrows. His mere appearance provoked the \"stoic\" audience to  screams of laughter, and his subsequent \"low comedy business,\" which  excelled much that I have seen on the civilized stage, failed not to  meet with uproarious demonstrations of approval. Slowly advancing as he  enacted his part, he in time reached the place where the yucca stood,  and, in his imbecile totterings, he at length stumbled on the plant and  pretended to have his flesh lacerated by the sharp leaves. He gave a  tremulous cry of pain, rubbed saliva on the part supposed to be wounded,  and muttered his complaints in a weak and shaking voice. He pretended  then to seek for the plant, and was three times wounded in his efforts  to find it. At length, kneeling on the ground, with his face buried in  the leaves, he feigned to discover it, and rejoiced with querulous  extravagance over his success. When he had marked the spot and the way  back to it with an exaggerated burlesque of the Indian methods of doing  these things, he went off to find his \"old woman\" and bring her to pick  the fruit. Soon he returned with a tall, stalwart man, dressed to  represent a hideous, absurd-looking old granny. The latter acted his  part throughout the rest of the drama with a skill fully equal to that  of his comrade.    145. There were scenes in this drama which may not be told in this  connection. It will suffice to say here that when the yucca fruit was  picked and put in the basket the old man helped the \"woman\" to shoulder  her load and the pair left the corral. The hackÃ n-inÃ§Ã¡` does not  invariably appear in the corral dance. I have attended one ceremony  where it was omitted. I have heard two descriptions of the dance which  differed very much from the one given above.    146. Many facts concerning not only the hackÃ n inÃ§Ã¡`, but other parts of  the mountain chant, have not been allowed to appear in this essay.  Recognized scientists may learn of them by addressing the author through  the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology.    147. _Tenth dance._ At twenty minutes past three an uninteresting  performance called the \"bear dance\" began. A man entered on all fours;  his face was painted white; he wore around his loins and over his  shoulders pieces of some dark pelt which may have been bear skin, but  looked more like the skin of a black sheep. The fire had now burned low  and the light was dim. He was accompanied by two attendants, one of whom  carried a rattle. He went twice around the ring, imitating the lumbering  gait of the bear. He occasionally made a clumsy lunge sidewise at some  of the spectators, as though he would attack them; but on these  occasions the man with the rattle headed him off and rattling in his  face directed him back to the usual course around the fire. This show  lasted five minutes.    148. The _Eleventh dance_, was the fire dance, or fire play, which was  the most picturesque and startling of all. Some time before the actors  entered, we heard, mingled with the blowing of the buffalo horn, strange  sounds, much like the call of the sand-hill crane; they will, for  convenience, be called trumpeting. These sounds continued to grow louder  and come nearer until they were heard at the opening in the east, and in  a second after, ten men, having no more clothing on than the performers  in the first dance, entered. Every man except the leader bore a long  thick bundle of shredded cedar bark in each hand and one had two extra  bundles on his shoulders for the later use of the leader. The latter  carried four small fagots of the same material in his hands. Four times  they all danced around the fire, waving their bundles of bark towards  it. They halted in the east; the leader advanced towards the central  fire, lighted one of his fagots, and trumpeting loudly threw it to the  east over the fence of the corral. He performed a similar act at the  south, at the west, and at the north; but before the northern brand was  thrown he lighted with it the bark bundles of his comrades. As each  brand disappeared over the fence some of the spectators blew into their  hands and made a motion as if tossing some substance after the departing  flame. When the fascicles were all lighted the whole band began a wild  race around the fire. At first they kept close together and spat upon  one another some substance of supposed medicinal virtue. Soon they  scattered and ran apparently without concert, the rapid racing causing  the brands to throw out long brilliant streamers of flame over the hands  and arms of the dancers. Then they proceeded to apply the brands to  their own nude bodies and to the bodies of their comrades in front of  them, no man ever once turning round; at times the dancer struck his  victim vigorous blows with his flaming wand; again he seized the flame  as if it were a sponge and, keeping close to the one pursued, rubbed the  back of the latter for several moments, as if he were bathing him. In  the mean time the sufferer would perhaps catch up with some one in front  of him and in turn bathe him in flame. At times when a dancer found no  one in front of him he proceeded to sponge his own back, and might keep  this up while making two or three circuits around the fire or until he  caught up with some one else. At each application of the blaze the loud  trumpeting was heard, and it often seemed as if a great flock of cranes  was winging its way overhead southward through the darkness. If a brand  became extinguished it was lighted again in the central fire; but when  it was so far consumed as to be no longer held conveniently in the hand,  the dancer dropped it and rushed, trumpeting, out of the corral. Thus,  one by one, they all departed. When they were gone many of the  spectators came forward, picked up some of the fallen fragments of cedar  bark, lighted them, and bathed their hands in the flames as a charm  against the evil effects of fire.      [Illustration:    Bureau of Ethnology    Fifth Annual Report Pl. XIII    FIRE DANCE.]    149. Did these dancers, next day, hide sore and blistered backs under  their serapes? I think not, for I have seen and conversed with some of  the performers immediately after the fire show, and they seemed happy  and had nothing to complain of. Did the medicine they spat on one  another save them? Certainly not, although the Indians claim it is a  true prophylactic against burns and call it azÃ¨-sakÃ¡zi or cold medicine.  But it is probable that the cedar bark ignites at a low temperature, and  more than probable that"]]]
