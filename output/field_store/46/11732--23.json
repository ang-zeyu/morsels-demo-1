[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#18)"],[1," in the midst of this  \"enormous bliss\"; we wander through the place, open-mouthed with wonder,  like country visitors admiring the Crown jewels, and then--we long to be  at home.    There are no children in any of Milton's poems. The introduction, in  _Paradise Lost_, of a real human child, such as Shakespeare brings into  _Coriolanus_ or _Macbeth_, would be like the bringing of a spark of fire  into a powder magazine. None of these edifying speeches could be made in  the presence of such an auditor, or such a critic. The whole system would  be blown into fragments; the artificial perspective that Milton preserves  with so great care would lose its glamour at a touch. Hell and Heaven and  Eden would dissolve away like the baseless fabric of a vision, a  scholar's nightmare, if once they were subjected to the free scrutiny of  a child.    _Paradise Lost_ will not bear--it could at no time, not even in the most  theological of ages, have borne--the more searching tests of realism, of  verisimilitude, and credibility. It is all the greater skill in the poet  that by his careful handling of our imagination and feelings he actually  does produce \"that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which  constitutes poetic faith.\" The less it will endure the trial as a system  or theory of the universe, the more wonderful does it appear as a work of  art. By the most delicate skill of architecture this gigantic filamented  structure has been raised into the air. It looks like some enchanted  palace that has lighted on the ground for a moment, resting in its  flight. It is really the product of the most elaborate and careful  engineering science; the strains and stresses put on every part of the  material have been calculated and allowed for. The poise and balance are  so minutely exact that it just stands, and no more. But that it should  stand at all is the marvel, seeing that it is spanned on frail arches  over the abyss of the impossible, the unnatural, and the grotesque. Let  it be granted that, in its main features, the system of _Paradise Lost_  does correspond with what was and is the religious creed of not a few  people. There is many a religious creed, strongly held, which is  convincing enough until the imagination begins to work it out in detail,  to try to realise it, in a clear light, as a connected whole. Then either  the imagination or the creed must give way. The remarkable thing about  Milton's achievement is that _Paradise Lost_ is both a creed and a  cosmical scheme of imagination, and that, except here and there, it is  impossible to point to parts of the poem and say, \"Here he ceased to  believe,\" or \"Here he gave up the effort to imagine.\" He both imagined  and believed throughout; he projected himself, like a sleep-walker, into  the mammoth caves of his antediluvian dreams, and lived among his own  radiant and shadowy creations. We need not, therefore, be surprised to  find that, in the first place, his daughters ran wild, and neither liked  nor understood their father; and that, in the second place, for the  rendering of his thought he invented a system of preternaturally majestic  diction, perfectly fitted for the utterance of his own conceptions, but,  when divorced from those conceptions, so monstrously artificial in  effect, that his imitators and followers, hoisting themselves on the  Miltonic stilts, brought the very name of \"poetic diction\" into a  contempt that has lasted for more than a century, and is not yet wholly  extinct.          CHAPTER IV  PARADISE LOST: THE ACTORS. THE LATER POEMS      The difficulties which Milton felt and conquered in the making of his  epic masterpiece had their origin, for the most part, in the intractable  and barren nature of his chosen theme. The dangers that beset him, and  sometimes tripped his feet, arose, on the other hand, from his own  declared intention in the handling of that theme:--      That, to the highth of this great argument,    I may assert Eternal Providence    And justify the ways of God to men.    The pursuit of this argumentative end led him through strange passes. A  less courageous or a more sensitive man might well have hesitated at the  entrance. But Milton hesitated at nothing. The ultimate mysteries of  human existence and Divine government were no mysteries to him.      The living Throne, the sapphire blaze,    Where angels tremble, while they gaze,    He saw;    --and he did not tremble. His persons are visible, their characters are  known, the nature of their relations is easily ascertained and expounded.  Everything, in short, is as plain as a pikestaff. So he came to picture  scenes which criticism is reluctant to traverse, and to make statements  which it is equally irreverent either to affirm or to deny.    Dr. Johnson, with a fearful and sincere piety, refused to follow Milton  into Heaven. \"Of the agents in the poem,\" he says, \"the chief are such as  it is irreverence to name on slight occasions.\" And again:--\"The  characters in the _Paradise Lost_ which admit of examination are those of  angels and of man.\" It is impossible not to respect Johnson's attitude,  but later critics have found it difficult to follow his example, and  Milton himself would have been the last to claim sanctuary in Heaven for  the imaginations on which the whole fabric of the poem depends.    Coleridge is one of the very few critics who have praised the conduct of  the celestial part of the story:--\"Wherever God is represented as acting  directly as Creator, without any exhibition of his own essence, Milton  adopts the simplest and sternest language of the Scriptures.... But, as  some personal interest was demanded for the purposes of poetry, Milton  takes advantage of the dramatic representation of God's address to the  Son, the Filial Alterity, and in _those addresses_ slips in, as it were  by stealth, language of affection, or thought, or sentiment.... He was  very wise in adopting the strong anthropomorphism of the Hebrew  Scriptures at once.\" Yet this is hardly an answer to the chief objections  that have been urged against Milton's conduct of the poem. These are  grounded, not on his adoption of the strong anthropomorphism of the  Hebrew Scriptures, but on the nature of the matter that he slips in, \"as  if by stealth,\" and the character that he attributes to his Divine  persons. Had he been a pagan, pure and simple, he might have been frankly  and explicitly materialistic in his conceptions. Had he been touched by  the spirit of the greatest of Christian poets, he might have shrouded the  Godhead in a mystery of silence and light. But he had something to prove  to the men of his own time, and neither course served him.    Milton's theodicy is of his own devising, and is neither Catholic nor  Calvinist. His heresies may be reduced to a single point; the ultimate  basis on which he rests the universe is political, not religious. The  fierce simplicity of his processes of thought here led him straight into  a trap. Law to him is an expression of Will, enforced by due penalties.  As promulgated by human authority, laws are to be obeyed only if they do  not clash with the dictates of a higher Power. The laws of God are  subject to no such restraint. They are; and, save by faith, there is no  further word to be said. But Milton had set himself to justify these laws  by reason. Destitute as he was of speculative power, he attempted no  transcendental amalgam of diverse conceptions, of Love and Law, of Mercy  and Justice. He fell back on Law as the naked assertion of Will, and  helped out the ancient argument of the pot and the potter with a  utilitarian appeal, which he puts into the mouth of a Seraph, to the  happy working of the Divine laws in practice.    So it comes about that the main argument of the poem is founded on an  outrage done to religion. In the place and under the name of Him \"with  whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning,\" Milton set up in  Heaven a whimsical Tyrant, all of whose laws are arbitrary and  occasional, and who exacts from his creatures an obedience that differs  from brute submission in one point only, that by the gift of free-will it  is put within their power to disobey. His commands, like his laws, are  issued from time to time. Sometimes they enjoin the impossible on his  subjects; as when Michael and Gabriel, at the head of the heavenly host,  are ordered to drive Satan and his crew out of Heaven into the abyss--a  task they prove wholly unable to accomplish. Sometimes orders are given  merely as an assertion of power, and to test submission; as when Raphael  is sent to keep the rebels confined in Hell, and explains subsequently to  Adam:--      Not that they durst without his leave attempt;    But us he sends upon his high behests    For state, as sovran King, and to inure    Our prompt obedience.    The particular event with which, according to Milton, the whole history  begins is presented with a crudity that would have horrified the Fathers.  The appointment of a Vicegerent to the Almighty, and the edict requiring  homage to be done to him, are announced \"on a day\" to the host of Angels  assembled by special summons for this purpose. During the night  following, one of the chief Archangels, thereafter called Satan, draws  off his forces to the north under pretext of preparing a welcome for the  new Commander, who is to make a progress through his domain, promulgating  more new laws. The purpose of the rebels is discerned by the All-Knowing,  who makes this strange speech to the Son:--      Let us advise, and to this hazard draw    With speed what force is left, and all employ    In our defence, lest unawares we lose    This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.    It is unnecessary to quote more of the speeches in Heaven; they are  tangles of Scriptural phrase, from which there can be extracted neither  good divinity nor good humanity. \"The glory of God,\" says the Wisdom of  Solomon, \"is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],[0,"The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#18)"],[1," hear Netta's verdict.    \"Do? I should rather think it would! If Lemonade doesn't mark it A1,  First Prize, I shall say she doesn't know her business, that's all!  You're pretty safe for that book of Browning, in my opinion.\"    \"Wish it were cash instead! But I shan't get it in any case,\" sighed  Gwen. \"If I did, I'd trade it for anything I could.\"    \"You mercenary wretch!\"    \"I'm so hard up. I'm no nearer paying what I owe you, Netta. I  literally haven't a penny in my pocket I wish you'd take it in kind  instead of money.\"    Netta sat silent, drumming with her fingers on the desk.    \"I've a rather decent locket, if you'd care for that--\" continued  Gwen.    \"Hush! Be quiet! You've given me an idea, Gwen Gascoyne.\"    \"Or I've a really jolly writing case--almost new--\"    \"I don't want your lockets or your writing cases; I've heaps of my  own. I know one thing I do want, though, and if you like to trade, you  can.\"    \"Done! Only name it, and it's yours with my blessing.\"    \"Well, I want this essay--\"    \"My essay! What do you mean?\"    Gwen snatched back her exercise book as a mother clutches her  first-born.    \"I mean what I say. If you like to hand over 'Thomas Carlyle' to me,  I'll take it instead of the sov., and call us quits. It would be a new  experience to win a prize. How amazed everyone would be!\"    \"You surely wouldn't pass it off as your own?\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Why, Netta! That would be rather strong, even for you!\"    \"I told you long ago I was no saint. Besides, what's the harm? It's a  business arrangement. You offered to pay me in kind, and this happens  to be the 'pound of flesh', I fancy. It's perfectly fair.\"    \"Um! Don't quite see the fairness myself.\"    \"But it is!\" protested Netta rather huffily. \"I believe lots of  popular authors don't do all their own writing themselves. They engage  secretaries to help them. I've even heard of clergymen buying their  sermons.\"    \"Oh, oh! Father doesn't!\" Gwen's tone was warm.    \"Well, I didn't say he did, but I believe it's done all the same. And if  a vicar can read somebody else's sermon in the pulpit as if it were his  own, I may hand in somebody else's essay. _Quod est demonstrandum_, my  child.\"    \"Can't see it!\" grunted Gwen.    \"Look here, Gwen Gascoyne, you've got to see it! I've been uncommonly  patient with you, but I don't quite appreciate the joke of being done  out of that sov. I must either have it or its equivalent. You can  please yourself which.\"    Netta's eyes were flashing, and her mouth was twitching ominously. She  was a jolly enough fair-weather comrade, but she could be uncommonly  nasty if things went wrong.    \"I suppose you don't consider it unfair to keep me waiting all this  time?\" she added scathingly.    Gwen kicked the desk and groaned.    \"Well, it just amounts to this: if you don't choose to come to terms,  I'll tell Lemonade. Yes, I will! I don't care a scrap if I went into  her room as well as you. You broke the china, and you'd get into the  worst row. It wouldn't be pleasant for you. I think you'd better hand  over Mr. Thomas Carlyle to me, my dear.\"    \"And what am I to do, I should like to know?\"    \"Write another on a different author.\"    \"There isn't time.\"    \"Yes there is, heaps! I don't want it to be as good as this,  naturally. Well, are you going to trade, or are you not? I can't wait  here all day!\"    For answer, Gwen held out the exercise book. She was in a desperately  tight corner; everything seemed to have conspired against her. She  knew Netta and her mad, reckless moods quite well enough to appreciate  the fact that her threat to tell Miss Roscoe was no idle one. When her  temper was roused, Netta was capable of anything.    \"It's her fault more than mine if it's not fair. I really can't help  it,\" thought Gwen, trying to find excuses for herself.    \"Oh! Glad you've come to your senses at last!\" sneered Netta, as she  clutched the precious manuscript and stalked away, slamming the door  behind her. There was no one else in the room, so Gwen laid her head  down on the desk, and indulged in an altogether early Victorian  exhibition of feeling. Her essay--her cherished essay, over which she  had taken such superhuman pains, to be torn away from her like this!  It was to have brought her such credit from Miss Roscoe, for even if  it did not win the prize, it would surely be highly commended. And she  had made herself a party to a fraud, for however much she might try  to whitewash her act, she knew she had no right to allow Netta to use  her work.    \"Dad would despise me! Oh, what an abominable mix and muddle it all  is! And I was going to start the New Year so straight!\" wailed Gwen.    Netta in the meantime had put the essay away in her locker with the  utmost satisfaction. She felt she had decidedly scored. Neither  brilliant nor a hard worker, she had no opportunity of distinguishing  herself in the Form under ordinary circumstances: here chance had  flung into her hand the very thing she wanted. It would not take long  to copy the sixteen pages of rather sprawling writing, then \"Thomas  Carlyle\" would be her own.    \"And a surprise for everyone!\" she chuckled complacently. \"Of course,  it's rather dear--a whole pound! But--yes, most undoubtedly it's worth  it!\"    To Gwen, not the lightest part of the business was that she was faced  with the horrible necessity of writing another essay. Only two days  remained, so time pressed. It was impossible to look up any subject  adequately, so she chose Dickens, as being an author whose books she  knew fairly well, and by dint of much brain racking and real hard  labour contrived to give some slight sketch of his life and an  appreciation of his genius. She was painfully conscious, however, that  the result was poor, the style slipshod, and the general composition  lacking both in unity and finish. She pulled a long face as she signed  her name to it.    \"That isn't going to do much for you, Gwen Gascoyne,\" she said to  herself. \"It won't even get 'commended'. Bah! I'm sick of the whole  thing!\"    She felt more sick still on the day when Miss Roscoe returned the  essays.    \"I had hoped the average standard would be higher,\" commented the  Principal. \"Very few girls have treated the subject in any really  critical spirit. There is only one paper worthy of notice--that on  Thomas Carlyle by Netta Goodwin, and it is so excellent that it stands  head and shoulders above all the others. I am very pleased, Netta,  very pleased indeed, that you should have done so well. Your essay is  carefully thought out and nicely expressed, and is evidently the  result of much painstaking work. You thoroughly deserve the prize  which I offered, and I have written your name in the book.\"    The Fifth Form gasped as Netta, with a smile of infinite triumph,  marched jauntily up the room to receive her copy of Browning's Poems.  Each girl looked at her neighbour in almost incredulous astonishment.  Netta Goodwin, of all people in the world, to have won such praise!    Gwen drew her breath hard, and clenched her fists till her nails hurt  her palms. At that moment, I am afraid, she hated Netta.    \"Who was your author, Gwen? I chose Thackeray,\" said Louise Mawson  afterwards.    \"Dickens--and I only got 'fairly creditable',\" responded Gwen. \"It's  just rotten!\"    Which was a word utterly tabooed both at Rodenhurst and at home, but  the sole one that seemed bad enough for the occasion.    \"So I hear Netta Goodwin's was the prize essay,\" remarked Father that  evening. \"Well, we can't all of us win prizes, can we? It was a  strange coincidence that she should have written on Thomas Carlyle  too!\"    \"Most remarkably strange, and very unfortunate for me,\" admitted Gwen,  drinking her cup of bitterness to the dregs.          CHAPTER XII    Gwen turns Henwife      To Gwen the spring term seemed to pass much more rapidly than the  autumn one had done. She was growing used to the Fifth Form; and the  work, though certainly not easy, was now, thanks to the extra coaching  that she had received, well within her compass. She did not feel so  terribly harassed over her preparation, and instead of, as formerly,  spending the whole evening until bedtime at her books, she was able to  spare a chance hour or two occasionally for other things. The change  of thoughts and the extra interests did her good; she lost her worried  expression, and though she still could not help wrinkling up her  forehead when trying to answer a question, some of her other bad  habits began to drop away. Beatrice had not to correct her nearly so  often, consequently there was less fridging of tempers between the two  sisters, and a great increase of calm in the home atmosphere. It was a  matter of tacit understanding at the Parsonage that Gwen raised most  of the household storms. Winnie and Lesbia had peace-loving  dispositions, and jogged along very evenly; and the boys, though apt  to be mischievous, were always good-humoured little fellows, not much  given to quarrelling unless they were teased. At present such a  blessed tranquillity reigned at the breakfast and tea-tables that  Beatrice really began to hope that the family volcano was quieting  down, and that her eruptions and explosions would be things of the  past.    Perhaps it was partly the pleasant spring weather that had such a  beneficial effect on Gwen's temper. She loved the early growing season  of the year, when every day was a little longer and lighter than the  last, and the bulbs were pushing up in the garden, and the hazel  catkins showering clouds of pollen in the lane, and the rooks cawing  and building in the clump of elms near the mill, and great flights of  screaming white sea-gulls, noisy, chattering jackdaws, and cheery,  whistling starlings flew all together in mixed flocks to feed on the  wolds. The morning walk to North Ditton across the heath, so bleak and  wretched in December, was a daily delight now the sun was "]]]
