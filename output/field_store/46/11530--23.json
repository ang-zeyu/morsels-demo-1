Those who are ignorant or heedless of the motivating purpose of the Cause  of God have rebelled against Him. Such men are the foreboders of evil,  whom God hath mentioned in His Book and Tablets and against whose  influence, clamour and deception He hath warned His people. Well is it  with those who, in the face of the remembrance of the Lord of Eternity,  regard the peoples of the world as utter nothingness, as a thing  forgotten, and hold fast to the firm handle of God in such wise that  neither doubts nor insinuations, nor swords, nor cannon could hold them  back or deprive them of His presence. Blessed are the steadfast; blessed  are they that stand firm in His Faith.    In response to thy request the Pen of Glory hath graciously described the  stations and grades of the Most Great Infallibility. The purpose is that  all should know of a certainty that the Seal of the Prophets(45)--may the  souls of all else but Him be offered up for His sake--is without likeness,  peer or partner in His Own station. The Holy Ones(46)--may the blessings of  God be upon them--were created through the potency of His Word, and after  Him they were the most learned and the most distinguished among the people  and abide in the utmost station of servitude. The divine Essence,  sanctified from every comparison and likeness, is established in the  Prophet, and God's inmost Reality, exalted above any peer or partner, is  manifest in Him. This is the station of true unity and of veritable  singleness. The followers of the previous Dispensation grievously failed  to acquire an adequate understanding of this station. The Primal  Point(47)--may the life of all else but Him be offered up for His  sake--saith: 'If the Seal of the Prophets had not uttered the word  \"Successorship\", such a station would not have been created.'    The people aforetime joined partners with God, though they professed  belief in His unity; and although they were the most ignorant amongst men,  they considered themselves the most accomplished. But, as a token of  divine retribution upon those heedless ones, their erroneous beliefs and  pursuits have, in this Day of Judgement, been made clear and evident to  every man of discernment and understanding.    Beseech thou God, the True One, that He may graciously shield the  followers of this Revelation from the idle fancies and corrupt imaginings  of such as belong to the former Faith, and may not deprive them of the  effulgent splendours of the day-star of true unity.    O Jalil! He Whom the world hath wronged now proclaimeth: The light of  Justice is dimmed, and the sun of Equity veiled from sight. The robber  occupieth the seat of the protector and guard, and the position of the  faithful is seized by the traitor. A year ago an oppressor ruled over this  city, and at every instant caused fresh harm. By the righteousness of the  Lord! He wrought that which cast terror into the hearts of men. But to the  Pen of Glory the tyranny of the world hath never been nor will it ever be  a hindrance. In the abundance of Our grace and loving-kindness We have  revealed specially for the rulers and ministers of the world that which is  conducive to safety and protection, tranquillity and peace; haply the  children of men may rest secure from the evils of oppression. He, verily,  is the Protector, the Helper, the Giver of victory. It is incumbent upon  the men of God's House of Justice to fix their gaze by day and by night  upon that which hath shone forth from the Pen of Glory for the training of  peoples, the upbuilding of nations, the protection of man and the  safeguarding of his honour.    The first Ishraq    When the Day-Star of Wisdom rose above the horizon of God's Holy  Dispensation it voiced this all-glorious utterance: They that are  possessed of wealth and invested with authority and power must show the  profoundest regard for religion. In truth, religion is a radiant light and  an impregnable stronghold for the protection and welfare of the peoples of  the world, for the fear of God impelleth man to hold fast to that which is  good, and shun all evil. Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos  and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness and justice, of  tranquillity and peace cease to shine. Unto this will bear witness every  man of true understanding.    The second Ishraq    We have enjoined upon all mankind to establish the Most Great Peace--the  surest of all means for the protection of humanity. The sovereigns of the  world should, with one accord, hold fast thereunto, for this is the  supreme instrument that can ensure the security and welfare of all peoples  and nations. They, verily, are the manifestations of the power of God and  the daysprings of His authority. We beseech the Almighty that He may  graciously assist them in that which is conducive to the well-being of  their subjects. A full explanation regarding this matter hath been  previously set forth by the Pen of Glory; well is it with them that act  accordingly.    The third Ishraq    It is incumbent upon everyone to observe God's holy commandments, inasmuch  as they are the wellspring of life unto the world. The heaven of divine  wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion  and the canopy of world order is upraised upon the two pillars of reward  and punishment.    The fourth Ishraq    In this Revelation the hosts that can render it victorious are the hosts  of praiseworthy deeds and upright character. The leader and commander of  these hosts hath ever been the fear of God, a fear that encompasseth all  things and reigneth over all things.    The fifth Ishraq    Governments should fully acquaint themselves with the conditions of those  they govern, and confer upon them positions according to desert and merit.  It is enjoined upon every ruler and sovereign to consider this matter with  the utmost care that the traitor may not usurp the position of the  faithful, nor the despoiler rule in the place of the trustworthy. Among  the officials who in the past have governed in this Most Great Prison  some, praise be to God, were adorned with justice, but as to others, We  take refuge with God. We beseech the One true God to guide them one and  all, that haply they may not be deprived of the fruit of faith and  trustworthiness, nor be withheld from the light of equity and justice.    The sixth Ishraq is union and concord amongst the children of men. From  the beginning of time the light of unity hath shed its divine radiance  upon the world, and the greatest means for the promotion of that unity is  for the peoples of the world to understand one another's writing and  speech. In former Epistles We have enjoined upon the Trustees of the House  of Justice either to choose one language from among those now existing or  to adopt a new one, and in like manner to select a common script, both of  which should be taught in all the schools of the world. Thus will the  earth be regarded as one country and one home. The most glorious fruit of  the tree of knowledge is this exalted word: Of one tree are all ye the  fruit, and of one bough the leaves. Let not man glory in this that he  loveth his country, let him rather glory in this that he loveth his kind.  Concerning this We have previously revealed that which is the means of the  reconstruction of the world and the unity of nations. Blessed are they  that attain thereunto. Blessed are they that act accordingly.    The seventh Ishraq    The Pen of Glory counselleth everyone regarding the instruction and  education of children. Behold that which the Will of God hath revealed  upon Our arrival in the Prison City and recorded in the Most Holy  Book.(48) Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son  and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been  laid down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away that which is commanded  unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which is required  for their instruction, if he be wealthy, and if not the matter devolveth  upon the House of Justice. Verily, have We made it a shelter for the poor  and needy. He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as  though he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My Glory, My  Loving-Kindness, My Mercy, that have compassed the world.    The eighth Ishraq    This passage, now written by the Pen of Glory, is accounted as part of the  Most Holy Book: The men of God's House of Justice have been charged with  the affairs of the people. They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among  His servants and the daysprings of authority in His countries.    O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is  upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the  sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new  problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should  be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof may act  according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the  sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine  inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be  obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House  of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that which  God hath revealed in His Book.    O people of Baha! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the  daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with the  cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which  is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favourably  received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. Leave that  soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the  Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and  strife. The hope is cherished that ye "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314"],[0,"Five Children and It (#18)"],[1,"the Psammead's--I  mean the enchanter's fault. I wish we'd never seen him.\"    \"He is an enchanter of might?\"    \"Oh yes--of might and main. Rather!\"    \"And thou deemest that it is the spells of the enchanter whom thou hast  angered that have lent strength to the besieging party,\" said the  gallant leader; \"but know thou that Wulfric de Talbot needs no  enchanter's aid to lead his followers to victory.\"    \"No, I'm sure you don't,\" said Robert, with hasty courtesy; \"of course  not--you wouldn't, you know. But, all the same, it's partly his fault,  but we're most to blame. You couldn't have done anything if it hadn't  been for us.\"    \"How now, bold boy?\" asked Sir Wulfric haughtily. \"Thy speech is dark,  and eke scarce courteous. Unravel me this riddle!\"    \"Oh,\" said Robert desperately, \"of course you don't know it, but you're  not _real_ at all. You're only here because the others must have been  idiots enough to wish for a castle--and when the sun sets you'll just  vanish away, and it'll be all right.\"    The captain and the men-at-arms exchanged glances at first pitying, and  then sterner, as the longest-booted man said, \"Beware, my noble lord;  the urchin doth but feign madness to escape from our clutches. Shall we  not bind him?\"    \"I'm no more mad than you are,\" said Robert angrily, \"perhaps not so  much--Only, I was an idiot to think you'd understand anything. Let me  go--I haven't done anything to you.\"    \"Whither?\" asked the knight, who seemed to have believed all the  enchanter story till it came to his own share in it. \"Whither wouldst  thou wend?\"    \"Home, of course.\" Robert pointed to the castle.    \"To carry news of succor? Nay!\"    \"All right, then,\" said Robert, struck by a sudden idea; \"then let me go  somewhere else.\" His mind sought eagerly among the memories of the  historical romance.    \"Sir Wulfric de Talbot,\" he said slowly, \"should think foul scorn to--to  keep a chap--I mean one who has done him no hurt--when he wants to cut  off quietly--I mean to depart without violence.\"    \"This to my face! Beshrew thee for a knave!\" replied Sir Wulfric. But  the appeal seemed to have gone home. \"Yet thou sayest sooth,\" he added  thoughtfully. \"Go where thou wilt,\" he added nobly, \"thou art free.  Wulfric de Talbot warreth not with babes, and Jakin here shall bear thee  company.\"    \"All right,\" said Robert wildly. \"Jakin will enjoy himself, I think.  Come on, Jakin. Sir Wulfric, I salute thee.\"    He saluted after the modern military manner, and set off running to the  sand-pit, Jakin's long boots keeping up easily.    He found the Fairy. He dug it up, he woke it up, he implored it to give  him one more wish.    \"I've done two to-day already,\" it grumbled, \"and one was as stiff a bit  of work as ever I did.\"    \"Oh, do, do, do, do, _do_!\" said Robert, while Jakin looked on with an  expression of open-mouthed horror at the strange beast that talked, and  gazed with its snail's eyes at him.    [Illustration: \"Oh, do, do, _do_!\" said Robert]    \"Well, what is it?\" snapped the Psammead, with cross sleepiness.    \"I wish I was with the others,\" said Robert. And the Psammead began to  swell. Robert never thought of wishing the castle and the siege away. Of  course he knew they had all come out of a wish, but swords and daggers  and pikes and lances seemed much too real to be wished away. Robert lost  consciousness for an instant. When he opened his eyes the others were  crowding round him.    \"We never heard you come in,\" they said. \"How awfully jolly of you to  wish it to give us our wish!\"    \"Of course we understood that was what you'd done.\"    \"But you ought to have told us. Suppose we'd wished something silly.\"    \"Silly?\" said Robert, very crossly indeed. \"How much sillier could you  have been, I'd like to know? You nearly settled _me_--I can tell  you.\"    Then he told his story, and the others admitted that it certainly had  been rough on him. But they praised his courage and cleverness so much  that he presently got back his lost temper, and felt braver than ever,  and consented to be captain of the besieged force.    \"We haven't done anything yet,\" said Anthea comfortably; \"we waited for  you. We're going to shoot at them through these little loopholes with  the bow and arrows uncle gave you, and you shall have first shot.\"    \"I don't think I would,\" said Robert cautiously; \"you don't know what  they're like near to. They've got _real_ bows and arrows--an awful  length--and swords and pikes and daggers, and all sorts of sharp things.  They're all quite, quite real. It's not just a--a picture, or a vision  or anything; they can _hurt us_--or kill us even, I shouldn't wonder. I  can feel my ear all sore yet. Look here--have you explored the castle?  Because I think we'd better let them alone as long as they let us alone.  I heard that Jakin man say they weren't going to attack till just  before sundown. We can be getting ready for the attack. Are there any  soldiers in the castle to defend it?\"    \"We don't know,\" said Cyril. \"You see, directly I'd wished we were in a  besieged castle, everything seemed to go upside down, and when it came  straight we looked out of the window, and saw the camp and things and  you--and of course we kept on looking at everything. Isn't this room  jolly? It's as real as real!\"    It was. It was square, with stone walls four feet thick, and great beams  for ceiling. A low door at the corner led to a flight of steps, up and  down. The children went down; they found themselves in a great arched  gate-house--the enormous doors were shut and barred. There was a window  in a little room at the bottom of the round turret up which the stair  wound, rather larger than the other windows, and looking through it they  saw that the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down; the moat looked  very wide and deep. Opposite the great door that led to the moat was  another great door, with a little door in it. The children went through  this, and found themselves in a big courtyard, with the great grey walls  of the castle rising dark and heavy on all four sides.    Near the middle of the courtyard stood Martha, moving her right hand  backwards and forwards in the air. The cook was stooping down and moving  her hands, also in a very curious way. But the oddest and at the same  time most terrible thing was the Lamb, who was sitting on nothing, about  three feet from the ground, laughing happily.    The children ran towards him. Just as Anthea was reaching out her arms  to take him, Martha said crossly, \"Let him alone--do, miss, when he _is_  good.\"    \"But what's he _doing_?\" said Anthea.    \"Doing? Why, a-setting in his high chair as good as gold, a precious,  watching me doing of the ironing. Get along with you, do--my iron's cold  again.\"    She went towards the cook, and seemed to poke an invisible fire with an  unseen poker--the cook seemed to be putting an unseen dish into an  invisible oven.    \"Run along with you, do,\" she said; \"I'm behindhand as it is. You won't  get no dinner if you come a-hindering of me like this. Come, off you  goes, or I'll pin a discloth to some of your tails.\"    \"You're _sure_ the Lamb's all right?\" asked Jane anxiously.    \"Right as ninepence, if you don't come unsettling of him. I thought  you'd like to be rid of him for to-day; but take him, if you want him,  for gracious' sake.\"    \"No, no,\" they said, and hastened away. They would have to defend the  castle presently, and the Lamb was safer even suspended in mid air in an  invisible kitchen than in the guard-room of the besieged castle. They  went through the first doorway they came to, and sat down helplessly on  a wooden bench that ran along the room inside.    \"How awful!\" said Anthea and Jane together; and Jane added, \"I feel as  if I was in a lunatic asylum.\"    \"What does it mean?\" Anthea said. \"It's creepy; I don't like it. I wish  we'd wished for something plain--a rocking-horse, or a donkey, or  something.\"    \"It's no use wishing _now_,\" said Robert bitterly; and Cyril said--    \"Do be quiet; I want to think.\"    He buried his face in his hands, and the others looked about them. They  were in a long room with an arched roof. There were wooden tables along  it, and one across at the end of the room, on a sort of raised platform.  The room was very dim and dark. The floor was strewn with dry things  like sticks, and they did not smell nice.    Cyril sat up suddenly and said--    \"Look here--it's all right. I think it's like this. You know, we wished  that the servants shouldn't notice any difference when we got wishes.  And nothing happens to the Lamb unless we specially wish it to. So of  course they don't notice the castle or anything. But then the castle is  on the same place where our house was--is, I mean--and the servants have  to go on being in the house, or else they _would_ notice. But you can't  have a castle mixed up with our house--and so _we_ can't see the house,  because we see the castle; and they can't see the castle, because they  go on seeing the house; and so\"--    \"Oh, _don't_,\" said Jane; \"you make my head go all swimmy, like being on  a roundabout. It doesn't matter! Only, I hope we shall be able to see  our dinner, that's all--because if it's invisible it'll be unfeelable as  well, and then we can't eat it! I _know_ it will, because I tried to  feel if I could feel the Lamb's chair and there was nothing under him at  all but air. And we can't eat air, and I feel just as if I hadn't had  any breakfast for years and years.\"    \"It's no use thinking about it,\" said Anthea. \"Let's go on exploring.  Perhaps we might find something to eat.\"    This lighted hope in every breast, and they went on exploring the  castle. But though it was the most perfect and delightful castle you can  possibly imagine, and furnished in the most complete and beautiful  manner, neither food nor men-at-arms were to be found in it.    \"If you'd only thought of wishing to be"]]]
