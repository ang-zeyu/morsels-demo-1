Quebec and Ontario.    Maine,--southern sections; New Hampshire,--most abundant eastward; in  the Connecticut valley confined to the hills in the immediate vicinity  of the river, extending up the tributary streams a short distance and  disappearing entirely before reaching the mouth of the Passumpsic (W. F.  Flint); Vermont,--common west of the Green mountains, less so in the  southern Connecticut valley (_Flora of Vermont_, 1900); Massachusetts,  Rhode Island, and Connecticut,--common.         South to the Gulf of Mexico; west to Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas,       Arkansas, and Texas.    =Habit.=--A tree of the first rank, 50-75 feet high and 1-6 feet in  diameter above the swell of the roots, exhibiting considerable diversity  in general appearance, trunk sometimes dissolving into branches like the  American elm, and sometimes continuous to the top. The finest specimens  in open land are characterized by a rather short, massive trunk, with  stout, horizontal, far-reaching limbs, conspicuously gnarled and twisted  in old age, forming a wide-spreading, open head of striking grandeur,  the diameter at the base of which is sometimes two or three times the  height of the tree.    =Bark.=--Trunk and larger branches light ash-gray, sometimes nearly  white, broken into long, thin, loose, irregular, soft-looking flakes; in  old trees with broad, flat ridges; inner bark light; branchlets  ash-gray, mottled; young shoots grayish-green, roughened with minute  rounded, raised dots.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds 1/8 to 1/4 inch long, round-ovate,  reddish-brown. Leaves simple, alternate, 3-7 inches long, 2-4 inches  wide, delicately reddish-tinted and pubescent upon both sides when  young; at maturity glabrous, light dull or glossy green above, paler and  somewhat glaucous beneath, turning to various reds in autumn; outline  obovate to oval; lobes 5-9; ascending, varying greatly in different  trees; when few, short and wide-based, with comparatively shallow  sinuses; when more in number, ovate-oblong, with deeper sinuses, or  somewhat linear-oblong, with sinuses reaching nearly to midrib; apex of  lobe rounded; base of leaf tapering; leafstalks short; stipules linear,  soon falling. The leaves of this species are often persistent till  spring, especially in young trees.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Appearing when the leaves are half grown; sterile  catkins 2-3 inches long, with slender, usually pubescent thread; calyx  yellow, pubescent; lobes 5-9, pointed: pistillate flowers sessile or  short-peduncled, reddish, ovate-scaled.    =Fruit.=--Maturing in the autumn of the first year, single, or more  frequently in pairs, sessile or peduncled: cup hemispherical to deep  saucer-shaped, rather thin; scales rough-knobby at base: acorn varying  from 1/2 inch to an inch in length, oblong-ovoid: meat sweet and edible,  said to be when boiled a good substitute for chestnuts.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in New England; grows well in all except  very wet soils, in all open exposures and in light shade; like all oaks,  difficult to transplant unless prepared by frequent transplanting in  nurseries, from which it is not readily obtainable in quantity; grows  very slowly and nearly uniformly up to maturity; comparatively free  from insect enemies but occasionally disfigured by fungous disease which  attacks immature leaves in spring.

BOX WHITE OAK.    =Habitat and Range.=         Doubtfully reported from southern Ontario.    In New England, mostly in sterile soil near the sea-coast;  Massachusetts,--southern Cape Cod from Falmouth to Brewster, the most  northern station reported, occasional; the islands of Naushon, Martha's  Vineyard where it is rather common, and Nantucket where it is rare;  Rhode Island,--along the shore of the northern arm of Wickford harbor  (L. W. Russell); Connecticut,--occasional along the shores of Long  Island sound west of New Haven.         South to Florida; west to Kansas, Indian territory, and Texas.    =Habit.=--Farther south, a tree of the first magnitude, reaching a  height of 100 feet, with a trunk diameter of 4 feet; in southern New  England occasionally attaining in woodlands a height of 50-60 feet; at  its northern limit in Massachusetts, usually 10 to 35 feet in height,  with a diameter at the ground of 6-12 inches. The trunk throws out  stout, tough, and often conspicuously crooked branches, the lower  horizontal or declining, forming a disproportionately large head, with  dark green, dense foliage. Near the shore the limbs often grow very low,  stretching along the ground as if from an underground stem.    =Bark.=--Resembling that of the white oak, but rather a darker gray,  rougher and firmer; upon old trunks furrowed and cut into oblongs; small  limbs brownish-gray, rough-dotted; season's shoots densely  tawny-tomentose.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, rounded or conical, brownish,  scales minutely pubescent or scurfy. Leaves simple, alternate, 3-8  inches long, two-thirds as wide, thickish, yellowish-green and tomentose  upon both sides when young, becoming a deep, somewhat glossy green  above, lighter beneath, both sides still somewhat scurfy; general  outline of leaf and of lobes, and number and shape of the latter,  extremely variable; type-form 5-lobed, all the lobes rounded, the three  upper lobes much larger, more or less subdivided, often squarish, the  two lower tapering to an acute, rounded, or truncate base; sinuses deep,  variable, often at right angles to the midrib; leafstalk short,  tomentose; stipules linear, pubescent, occasionally persistent till  midsummer. The leaves are often arranged at the tips of the branches in  star-shaped clusters, giving rise to the specific name _stellata_.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Sterile catkins 1-3 inches long, connecting  thread woolly; calyx 4-8 parted, lobes acute, densely pubescent, yellow;  stamens 4-8, _anthers with scattered hairs_: pistillate flowers single  or in clusters of 2, 3, or more, sessile or on a short stem; stigma red.    =Fruit.=--Maturing the first season, single and sessile, or nearly so,  or in clusters of 2, 3, or more, on short footstalks: cup top-shaped or  cup-shaped, 1/3-1/2 the length of the acorn, about 3/4 inch wide, thin;  scales smooth or sometimes hairy along the top, acutish or roundish,  slightly thickened at base: acorn 1/2-1 inch long, sweet.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in New England; prefers a good,  well-drained, open soil; quite as slow-growing as the white oak; seldom  found in nurseries and difficult to transplant.

Since we cannot control this one  impulsively-truthful medium of expression, it becomes a matter of  policy as well as of morals to harbor no spirits whose \"possession\" of  us would be an unpleasant and inconvenient revelation.    Next to the eyes, the pose of the figure indicates the sentiment of the  moment.  Arrogant assumption of superiority may be read in the expanded  chest, the stiffened neck, and the head thrown backward at a decided  angle; or, subservient humility is seen in the forward-bending head and  the wilted droop of the shoulders.  And again, the difference between a  real humility and the artificial deference which gallantry prompts is  easily detected.  The gallant's head and shoulders are bowed, but not  in meekness, for there is a certain tension in the controlled muscles  that suggests that he can \"straighten up\" at will, whereas the really  humble man appears to have no power to lift his bowed head or equally  drooping spirit.    The bending of the head and trunk, or the \"bow,\" is the final and most  active exponent of the spirit of the greeting.  In its degrees and  gradations are marked the degrees of deference, real or formal.    The bow begins at the head, and may observe the following gradations:    It may be an inclination of the head only, differing from a \"nod\" in  the dignity of movement.    The inclination may extend to the shoulders, causing a slightly  perceptible forward leaning.  This inclination may continue to the  waist line.    The extreme inclination bends the entire trunk from the hips.  The legs  are straight and the feet near together, in the attitude of \"position\"  in free gymnastics.    In every bow, of whatever gradation, the movement should be slow, the  eye steady, the face serene, and the whole demeanor expressive of  polite interest in the object.  An averted eye is disrespectful, and  suggests insincerity or treachery.  Not that it always means either;  the \"drooping eyelash\" is affected by many women as gracefully  expressive of feminine modesty.  It may be coquettish, but there is  nothing particularly womanly in never looking a man in the eye.  Search  the face that confronts you, and learn what manner of man this is whom  you are receiving into your company and fellowship.  If he quails under  the inquisition, so much the worse for him.  If he is worth looking at,  it is a pity to miss the sight.  Moreover, we more than half suspect  that a woman's face is more attractive if her eyes occasionally \"look  up clear,\" instead of allowing the downcast lids to hide all of their  vivacity and expression.    The gayety or the gravity of the countenance may serve to measure the  cordiality or the reserve which respectively distinguish two  \"bows\"--exactly alike as to movement, and equally courteous, the one  inviting confidence, the other repelling familiarity.  The time, the  place, and the occasion, and the mutual relations of people, decide the  essential character of the appropriate bow.  It must always be the  exponent of the nature and disposition of the individual, and of his  relation to the person whom he greets.  No one has precisely the _same  manner_ for any two people of his acquaintance--that is, if he has any  vital manner at all.  We are to others largely what they inspire us to  be, and only lifeless indifference reduces \"manner\" to one same  automatic manifestation.  The life of a social greeting is in its  exclusive spirit, and though the variations of outward manner are  difficult to trace, it is a graceful and flattering thing to make this  specialty of manner felt in every greeting extended.  Perhaps, after  all, it is the eye that controls this, as the spirit within controls  the eye.    In general, the manner of a greeting should be optimistic, free from  ungracious suspicion, and indicating a cheerful willingness to take  people at their best; and even when most sternly forbidding  intrusiveness, it should appear that the repulse is for good cause, and  is not merely the expression of a capricious and unfounded arrogance.  The latter quality, quite as often as not, characterizes the manner of  snobs toward people who are infinitely their superiors in all that  indicates character and breeding.    The \"curtsey\"--or \"courtesy\"--is a feature of the minuet, and revived  with the old-fashioned dance.  It is a pretty bit of old-time grace,  and is appropriate in responding to formal introductions and greetings  in the drawing-room, especially when paying respect to elderly people.  It is most effective when executed in a costume of voluminous  draperies.  It is a woman's ceremonial; no man ever \"curtseys.\"  The  regulation \"bow\" is the only \"deference\" that gracefully combines with  a dress suit.    The _courtesy_ is a strictly formal obeisance, and the courtly  reverence which it embodies is something more abstract than concrete,  not necessarily inspired by the person to whom its deference is shown.  Like all greetings exchanged in the midst of crowds or in public  places, it is somewhat impersonal in manner.  Personal recognitions and  distinctions are reserved for more private occasions.  One's greetings  to fellow-guests at a reception are uniformly affable, irrespective of  personal preferences.  Though our dearest friend and our direst foe  both be present, we must not pointedly discriminate between them; we  are not at liberty to use the parlors of our host for either a lover's  tryst or a duelling-ground.    A guest's first duty on entering a parlor or drawing-room is to pay his  or her respects to the hostess and the ladies who are receiving with  her.  Gentlemen should also make it a point to find the host as soon as  possible, and extend to him a similar courtesy.  The host, in turn,  when not receiving formally with the hostess, roams at large, giving a  hospitable greeting to each lady among his guests.    In America, when a lady and gentleman meet, after being duly  introduced, it is the lady's privilege to bow first.  This rule  protects her from the intrusion of an unwelcome acquaintance.  But when  the acquaintance is established and mutually agreeable, the rule is  immaterial.    In general, the elder or the more distinguished person bows first.  But  if the one who for any reason would be the proper one to take the  initiative is known to be near-sighted, and liable to overlook an  acquaintance unintentionally, it is more polite for the other person  not to stand on ceremony.    It is interesting to note that on the continent of Europe the rule  regarding recognitions is exactly reversed.  The subject bows first to  the king, the courtier to the lady; deference to a superior, rather  than social equality, being expressed by the bow.    One of the moot questions of the day is, \"When is it proper to  introduce people to each other?\"  The strictest etiquette forbids  casual social introductions, or the introducing of any two people at  any time without the consent of both parties.  It is argued that people  who meet in a drawing-room as fellow-guests are introduced, by that  mere fact, sufficiently for the social purposes of the hour; and they  may engage in conversation, if they choose, without the least  hesitancy; both understanding that this interchange involves no  acquaintance beyond the present occasion.  By this arrangement an  awkward silence is averted, and it certainly seems as if the chief  argument in favor of \"introducing people\" is met; since, with \"the  roof\" as their transient introduction, they are perfectly at ease  without personal introductions.  When people are used to this idea it  is altogether the most sensible and agreeable solution of the question;  but many social assemblies demonstrate that a large number of people  are yet waiting to be introduced, and not without some feeling of  resentment when this ceremony is neglected.  Let it be understood that  any one is at liberty to speak to a fellow-guest without an  introduction; also, that such a \"talk\" does not warrant any subsequent  claim of acquaintance.  If in the course of this impromptu chat mutual  interest is awakened, either one may later seek an introduction in due  form through some common friend.    On informal occasions, when few guests are present, especially in  country towns, it may be more kindly and social to give personal  introductions; and the good sense of this idea, probably, is founded on  the fact that under these conditions a hostess can be reasonably sure  that the acquaintance will be congenial.  To the villager many of the  extreme rules of etiquette are unreasonable, because the conditions  that enforce them in town life are not present in the life of the quiet  hamlet.  The rule regarding introductions is one which must be modified  to suit circumstances.  It is one of the cases when various delicate  considerations may justify exceptions.  The lady who in her city home  introduces nobody, may in her country home introduce everybody, if that  seems best.  In the matter of delicate exceptions we observe the most  significant display of tact.    When introductions are made, gentlemen should be presented to ladies,  younger people to older people, etc.  The formula for introductions may  be abbreviated to a mere announcement of the two names: \"Mr.  Smith--Mrs. Jones\"--the pause and inflection filling the ellipsis; and  really, upon the tone and manner depends the courtesy of the  introduction so barren of phrasing.  A formal presentation is made in  this form:--\"Miss Smith, allow me to present Mr. Jones.\"    Tact suggests that a hostess shall avoid bringing uncongenial people  together; but if this unfortunately happens through ignorance or  thoughtlessness, tact with equal urgency requires that the guests thus  inauspiciously mingled shall not allow any one, not even the hostess  herself, to"]]]
