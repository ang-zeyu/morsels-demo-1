They met at Stirling; pretended an anxious concern for  the security of religion; framed engagements for mutual defence; and  made applications to Elizabeth for assistance and protection.[**] That  princess, after publishing the expressions of her displeasure against  the marriage, had secretly ordered her ambassadors, Randolf and  Throgmorton, to give in her name some promises of support to the  malecontents; and had even sent them a supply of ten thousand pounds, to  enable them to begin an insurrection.[***]    Mary was no sooner informed of the meeting at Stirling, and the  movements of the lords, than she summoned them to appear at court, in  order to answer for their conduct; and having levied some forces to  execute the laws, she obliged the rebels to leave the low countries,  and take shelter in Argyleshire. That she might more effectually cut off  their resources, she proceeded with the king to Glasgow, and forced them  from their retreat. They appeared at Paisley, in the neighborhood,  with about a thousand horse, and passing the queen's army, proceeded to  Hamilton, thence to Edinburgh, which they entered without resistance.  They expected great reenforcements in this place, from the efforts of  Knox and the seditious preachers; and they beat their drums, desiring  all men to enlist, and receive wages for the defence of God's  glory.[****]         * See note G, at the end of the volume.         ** Keith, p. 293, 294, 300, 301.         *** Knox, p. 380.

But the nation was in no disposition for rebellion: Mary was esteemed  and beloved: her marriage was not generally disagreeable to the people:  and the interested views of the malecontent lords were so well known,  that their pretence of zeal for religion had little influence even on  the ignorant populace.[*] The king and queen advanced to Edinburgh  at the head of their army: the rebels were obliged to retire into the  south; and being pursued by a force which now amounted to eighteen  thousand men,[**] they found themselves under a necessity of abandoning  their country, and of taking shelter in England.    Elizabeth, when she found the event so much to disappoint her  expectations, thought proper to disavow all connections with the  Scottish malecontents, and to declare every where, that she had  never given them any encouragement, nor any promise of countenance or  assistance. She even carried further her dissimulation and hypocrisy.  Murray had come to London, with the abbot of Kilwinning, agent for  Chatelrault; and she seduced them, by secret assurances of protection,  to declare before the ambassadors of France and Spain that she had  nowise contributed to their insurrection. No sooner had she extorted  this confession from them, than she chased them from her presence,  called them unworthy traitors, declared that their detestable rebellion  was of bad example to all princes; and assured them, that as she had  hitherto given them no encouragement, so should they never thenceforth  receive from her any assistance or protection.[***] Throgmorton alone,  whose honor was equal to his abilities, could not be prevailed on to  conceal the part which he had acted in the enterprise of the Scottish  rebels; and being well apprised of the usual character and conduct of  Elizabeth, he had had the precaution to obtain an order of council  to authorize the engagements which he had been obliged to make with  them.[****]         * Knox, p. 380, 385.         ** Knox, p. 388.         *** Melvil, p. 57.

The banished lords, finding themselves so harshly treated by Elizabeth,  had recourse to the clemency of their own sovereign; and after some  solicitation and some professions of sincere repentance, the duke of  Chatelrault obtained his pardon, on condition that he should retire into  France. Mary was more implacable against the ungrateful earl of Murray  and the other confederates, on whom she threw the chief blame of the  enterprise; but as she was continually plied with applications from  their friends, and as some of her most judicious partisans in England  thought, that nothing would more promote her interests in that kingdom,  than the gentle treatment of men so celebrated for their zeal against  the Catholic religion, she agreed to give way to her natural temper,  which inclined not to severity, and she seemed determined to restore  them to favor.[*] In this interval, Rambouillet arrived as ambassador  from France, and brought her advice from her uncle, the cardinal of  Lorraine, to whose opinion she always paid an extreme deference, by  no means to pardon these Protestant leaders, who had been engaged in a  rebellion against her.[**]    The two religions, in France, as well as in other parts of Europe, were  rather irritated than tired with their acts of mutual violence; and  the peace granted to the Hugonots, as had been foreseen by Coligny, was  intended only to lull them asleep and prepare the way for their final  and absolute destruction. The queen regent made a pretence of travelling  through the kingdom, in order to visit the provinces, and correct all  the abuses arising from the late civil war; and after having held some  conferences on the frontiers with the duke of Lorraine and the duke of  Savoy, she came to Bayonne, where she was met by her daughter, the queen  of Spain, and the duke of Alva. Nothing appeared in the congress of  these two splendid courts, but gayety, festivity, love, and joy; but  amidst these smiling appearances were secretly fabricated schemes the  most bloody, and the most destructive to the repose of mankind, that  had ever been thought of in any age or nation. No less than a total  and universal extermination of the Protestants by fire and sword was  concerted by Philip and Catharine of Medicis; and Alva, agreeably to his  fierce and sanguinary disposition, advised the queen regent to commence  the execution of this project, by the immediate massacre of all the  leaders of the Hugonots.[***]         * Melvil, p. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63.

But that princess, though equally hardened against every humane  sentiment, would not forego this opportunity of displaying her wit  and refined politics; and she purposed rather by treachery and  dissimulation, which she called address, to lead the Protestants into  the snare, and never to draw the sword till they were totally disabled  from resistance. The cardinal of Lorraine, whose character bore a  greater affinity to that of Alva, was a chief author of this barbarous  association against the reformers; and having connected his hopes of  success with the aggrandizement of his niece, the queen of Scots, he  took care that her measures should correspond to those violent counsels  which were embraced by the other Catholic princes. In consequence of  this scheme, he turned her from the road of clemency, which she intended  to have followed, and made her resolve on the total ruin of the banished  lords.[*]    {1565.} A parliament was summoned at Edinburgh for attainting them; and  as their guilt was palpable and avowed, no doubt was entertained but  sentence would be pronounced against them. It was by a sudden and  violent incident, which, in the issue, brought on the ruin of Mary  herself, that they were saved from the rigor of the law.    The marriage of the queen of Scots with Lord Darnley was so natural,  and so inviting in all its circumstances, that it had been precipitately  agreed to by that princess and her council; and while she was allured  by his youth, and beauty, and exterior accomplishments, she had at first  overlooked the qualities of his mind, which nowise corresponded to  the excellence of his outward figure. Violent, yet variable in his  resolutions; insolent, yet credulous and easily governed by flatterers;  he was destitute of all gratitude, because he thought no favors equal to  his merit; and being addicted to low pleasures, he was equally incapable  of all true sentiments of love and tenderness.[*] The queen of Scots,  in the first effusions of her fondness, had taken a pleasure in exalting  him beyond measure; she had granted him the title of king; she had  joined his name with her own in all public acts; she intended to have  procured him from the parliament a matrimonial crown; but having leisure  afterwards to remark his weakness and vices, she began to see the danger  of her profuse liberality, and was resolved thenceforth to proceed  with more reserve in the trust which she should confer upon him. His  resentment against this prudent conduct served but the more to increase  her disgust: and the young prince, enraged at her imagined neglects,  pointed his vengeance against every one whom he deemed the cause of this  change in her measures and behavior.         * Melvil, p. 63. Keith's Append. p. 176.    There was in the court one David Rizzio, who had of late obtained a very  extraordinary degree of confidence and favor with the queen of Scots. He  was a Piedmontese, of mean birth, son of a teacher of music, himself  a musician; and finding it difficult to subsist by his art in his own  country, he had followed into Scotland an ambassador, whom the duke of  Savoy sent thither to pay his compliments to Mary, some time after her  first arrival. He possessed a good ear, and a tolerable voice; and  as that princess found him useful to complete her band of music, she  retained him in her service after the departure of his master. Her  secretary for French despatches having some time after incurred her  displeasure, she promoted Rizzio to that office, which gave him frequent  opportunities of approaching her person, and insinuating himself into  her favor. He was shrewd and sensible, as well as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E.

The kneeling at the altar, and the using of copes, a species of  embroidered vestment, in administering the sacrament, were also known  to be great objects of scandal, as being Popish practices; but the  opposition rather increased than abated the zeal of the prelate for the  introduction of these habits and ceremonies.    All kinds of ornament, especially pictures, were necessary for  supporting that mechanical devotion which was purposed to be raised in  this model of religion: but as these had been so much employed by the  church of Rome, and had given rise to so much superstition, or what  the Puritans called idolatry it was impossible to introduce them into  English churches without exciting general murmurs and complaints. But  Laud possessed of present authority, persisted in his purpose, and made  several attempts towards acquiring these ornaments. Some of the pictures  introduced by him were also found, upon inquiry, to be the very same  that might be met with in the mass-book. The crucifix too, that eternal  consolation of all pious Catholics, and terror to all sound Protestants,  was not forgotten on this occasion.[*]    It was much remarked, that Sheffield, the recorder of Salisbury, was  tried in the star chamber, for having broken, contrary to the bishop of  Salisbury's express injunctions, a painted window of St. Edmond's  church in that city. He boasted that he had destroyed these monuments  of idolatry: but for this effort of his zeal, he was fined five  hundred pounds, removed from his office, condemned to make a public  acknowledgment, and be bound to his good behavior.[**]    Not only such of the clergy as neglected to observe every ceremony were  suspended and deprived by the high commission court: oaths were, by many  of the bishops, imposed or the churchwardens; and they were sworn  to inform against any one who acted contrary to the ecclesiastical  canons.[***] Such a measure, though practised during the reign of  Elizabeth, gave much offence, as resembling too nearly the practice of  the Romish inquisition.    To show the greater alienation from the churches reformed after the  Presbyterian model, Laud advised that the discipline and worship of the  church should be imposed on the English regiments and trading companies  abroad.[****] All foreigners of the Dutch and Walloon congregations were  commanded to attend the established church; and indulgence was granted  to none after the children of the first denizens.[v]         * Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 272, 273.         ** Rushworth, Vol. ii. p. 152.

Franklyn, p. 451.         v    Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 272    Scudamore, too, the king's ambassador at Paris, had orders to withdraw  himself from the communion of the Hugonots. Even men of sense were apt  to blame this conduct, not only because it gave offence in England, but  because, in foreign countries, it lost the crown the advantage of being  considered as the head and support of the reformation.[*]    On pretence of pacifying disputes, orders were issued from the council,  forbidding on both sides all preaching and printing with regard to  the controverted points of predestination and free will. But it was  complained of, and probably with reason that the impartiality was  altogether confined to the orders, and that the execution of them was  only meant against the Calvinists.    In return for Charles's indulgence towards the church, Laud and his  followers took care to magnify, on every occasion, the regal authority,  and to treat with the utmost disdain or detestation all Puritanical  pretensions to a free and independent constitution. But while these  prelates were so liberal in raising the crown at the expense of public  liberty, they made no scruple of encroaching, themselves, on the royal  rights the most incontestable, in order to exalt the hierarchy, and  procure to their own order dominion and independence. All the doctrines  which the Romish church had borrowed from some of the fathers, and which  freed the spiritual from subordination to the civil power, were now  adopted by the church of England, and interwoven with her political  and religious tenets. A divine and apostolical charter was insisted on,  preferably to a legal and parliamentary one.[**]         * State Papers collected by the earl of Clarendon, p 338.         ** Whitlocke, p. 22.    The sacerdotal character was magnified as sacred and indefeasible: all  right to spiritual authority, or even to private judgment in spiritual  subjects, was refused to profane laymen: ecclesiastical courts were held  by the bishops in their own name, without any notice taken of the king's  authority: and Charles, though extremely jealous of every claim in  popular assemblies, seemed rather to encourage than repress those  encroachments of his clergy. Having felt many sensible inconveniencies  from the independent spirit of parliaments, he attached himself entirely  to those who professed a devoted obedience to his crown and person;  nor did he foresee, that the ecclesiastical power which he exalted, not  admitting of any precise boundary, might in time become more dangerous  to public peace, and no less fatal to royal prerogative, than the other.    So early as the coronation, Laud was the person, according to general  opinion, that introduced a novelty which, though overlooked by Charles,  made a deep impression on many of the bystanders. After the usual  ceremonies, these words were recited to the king: \"Stand and hold fast,  from henceforth the place to which you have been heir by the succession  of your forefathers, being now delivered to you by the authority of  Almighty God, and by the hands of us and all the bishops and servants of  God. And, as you see the clergy to come nearer the altar than others,  so remember that, in all places convenient, you give them greater honor;  that the Mediator of God and man may establish you on the kingly throne,  to be a mediator betwixt the clergy and the laity; and that you may  reign forever with Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords.\"  [*]    The principles which exalted prerogative, were not entertained by the  king merely as soft and agreeable to his royal ears; they were also put  in practice during the time that he ruled without parliaments. Though  frugal and regular in his expense, he wanted money for the support of  government; and he levied it, either by the revival of obsolete laws, or  by violations, some more open, some more disguised, of the privileges of  the nation. Though humane and gentle in his temper, he gave way to a  few severities in the star chamber and high commission, which seemed  necessary in order to support the present mode of administration, and  repress the rising spirit of liberty throughout the kingdom. Under these  two heads may be reduced all the remarkable transactions of this reign  during some years; for, in peaceable and prosperous times, where  a neutrality in foreign affairs is observed, scarcely any thing is  remarkable, but what is in some degree blamed or blamable. And, lest the  hope of relief or protection from parliament might encourage opposition,  Charles issued a proclamation, in which he declared, \"That whereas, for  several ill ends, the calling again of a parliament is divulged; though  his majesty has shown, by frequent meetings with his people, his love to  the use of parliaments: yet the late abuse having for the present driven  him unwillingly out of that course; he will account it presumption  for anyone to prescribe to him any time for the calling of that  assembly.\"[**]         * Franklyn, p. 114. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 201.         ** Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 389. Rush. vol. ii. p. 3.    This was generally construed as a declaration, that during this reign no  more parliaments were intended to be summoned.[*] And every measure of  the king's confirmed a suspicion so disagreeable to the generality of  the people.    Tonnage and poundage continued to be levied by the royal authority  alone. The former additional impositions were still exacted. Even new  impositions were laid on several kinds of merchandise.[**]    The custom-house officers received orders from the council to enter into  any house, warehouse, or cellar; to search any trunk or chest; and to  break any bulk whatever; in default of the payment of customs.[***]    In order to exercise the militia, and to keep them in good order, each  county, by an edict of the council, was assessed in a certain sum, for  maintaining a muster-master, appointed for that service.[****]    Compositions were openly made with recusants, and the Popish religion  became a regular part of the revenue. This was all the persecution which  it underwent during the reign of Charles.[v]    A commission was granted for compounding with such as were possessed of  crown lands upon defective titles; and on this pretence some money was  exacted from the people.[v*]    There was a law of Edward II.,[v**] that whoever was possessed of twenty  pounds a year in land, should be obliged, when summoned, to appear and  to receive the order of knighthood. Twenty pounds at that time, partly  by the change of denomination, partly by that in the value of money,  were equivalent to two hundred in the seventeenth century; and it seemed  just that the king should not strictly insist on the letter of the law,  and oblige people of so small revenue to accept of that"]]]
