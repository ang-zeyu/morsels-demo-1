All that  is necessary now is to make a block (O), 8 inches long, rounded on one  edge, and a wedge (P).    [Illustration: _Fig 243. Tool Rest._]    A leather belt or strap (Q), 1-1/2 inches wide, formed into a loop, as  shown in the perspective view (R), serves as a means for holding the  rest rigidly when the wedge is driven in.    MATERIALS.--Then procure the following bolts:            4-3/8\" bolts, 10\" long.          8-3/8\"  ''     6\" ''         20-3/8\"  ''     5\" ''          5-3/8\"  ''     9\" ''    THE MANDREL.--A piece of steel tubing (S), No. 10 gage, 3/4 inch in  diameter, 11-1/2 inches long, will be required for the mandrel. Get a  blacksmith, if a machine shop is not convenient, to put a fixed center  (1) in one end, and a removable centering member (2) in the other end.    On this mandrel place a collar (3), held by a set screw, and alongside  of it a pair of pulleys, each 1-1/2 inches wide, one of them, being,  say, 2 inches in diameter, and the other 3 inches. This mandrel is held  in position by means of the posts of the frame which carry the split  journal bearings. This form of bearing will make a durable lathe, free  from chattering, as the bolts can be used for tightening the mandrel  whenever they wear.    [Illustration: _Fig. 244. Mandrel._]    The center point (1) is designed to rest against a metal plate (4)  bolted to the wooden post, as shown in the large drawing.    FLY-WHEEL.--It now remains only to provide a fly-wheel and treadle with  the communicating belt. The fly-wheel may be of any convenient size, or  it may be some discarded pulley or wheel. Suppose it is two feet in  diameter; then, as your small pulley is 2 inches in diameter, each  revolution of the large wheel makes twelve revolutions in the mandrel,  and you can readily turn the wheel eighty times a minute. In that case  your mandrel will revolve 960 revolutions per minute, which is ample  speed for your purposes.    The wheel should be mounted on a piece of 3/4-inch steel tubing, one end  having a crank 3 inches long. This crank is connected up by a pitman  rod, with the triangularly shaped treadle frame.    Such a lathe is easily made, as it requires but little metal or machine  work, and it is here described because it will be a pleasure for a boy  to make such a useful tool. What he needs is the proper plan and the  right dimensions to carry out the work, and his own ingenuity will make  the modifications suitable to his purpose.    The illustration (Fig. 245) shows such a lathe assembled ready for work.    THE TOOLS REQUIRED.--A few simple tools will complete an outfit capable  of doing a great variety of work. The illustration (Fig. 246) shows five  chisels, of which all other chisels are modifications.    A and B are both oblique firmer chisels, A being ground with a bevel on  one side only, and B with a bevel on each side.    C is a broad gage, with a hollow blade, and a curved cutting edge,  ground with a taper on the rounded side only.    D is a narrow gage similarly ground, and E is a V-shaped gage.    [Illustration: _Fig. 245._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 246._]    It may be observed that in wood-turning sharp tools are absolutely  necessary, hence a good oil stone, or several small, round and V-shaped  stones should be used.          CHAPTER XV    ON THE USE OF STAINS      As this subject properly belongs to the painter and decorator, it is not  necessary to go into details concerning the methods used to finish off  your work. As you may not be able to afford the luxury of having your  productions painted or stained, enough information will be given to  enable you, if the character of the wood justifies it, to do the work  yourself to a limited extent.    SOFT WOOD.--As, presumably, most of your first work will be done with  pine, poplar, or other light-colored material, and, as many people  prefer the furniture to be dark in color, you should be prepared to  accommodate them.    USE OF STAINS.--Our subject has nothing to do with the technique of  staining, but has reference, solely, to the use of stains. I recommend,  therefore, that, since all kinds of stains are now kept in stock, and  for sale everywhere, you would better rely upon the manufactured goods  rather than to endeavor to mix up the paints yourself.    STAINS AS IMITATIONS.--It will be well to remember one thing as to  stains. Never attempt to stain anything unless that stain is intended  to produce an imitation of some real wood. There are stains made up  which, when applied, do not imitate any known wood. This is bad taste  and should be avoided. Again you should know that the same stain tint  will not produce like effects on the different light-colored woods. Try  the cherry stain on pieces of pine, poplar, and birch, and you will  readily see that while pine gives a brilliant red, comparatively  speaking, pine or birch will be much darker, and the effect on poplar  will be that of a muddy color. In fact, poplar does not stain cherry to  good advantage; and for birch the ordinary stain should have a small  addition of vermilion.    By making trials of your stains before applying them to the furniture,  you will readily see the value of this suggestion.    GOOD TASTE IN STAINING.--Oak, mahogany, cherry, black walnut, and like  imitations are always good in an artistic sense, but imitations of  unfamiliar woods mean nothing to the average person. The too common  mistake is to try to imitate oak by staining pine or poplar or birch. It  may, with good effect, be stained to imitate cherry.    Oregon pine, or some light-colored wood, with a strong contrasting grain  may be used for staining in imitation of oak.    GREAT CONTRASTS BAD.--Violent contrasts in furniture staining have the  effect of cheapness, unless the contrasting outlines are artistically  distributed throughout the article, from base to top finish.    STAINING CONTRASTING WOODS.--Then, again, do not stain a piece of  furniture so that one part represents a cheap, soft wood, and the other  part a dark or costly wood. Imagine, for instance, a cabinet with the  stiles, rails and mullions of mahogany, and the panels of pine or  poplar, or the reverse, and you can understand how incongruous would be  the result produced.    On the other hand, it would not be a very artistic job to make the  panels of cherry and the mullions and stiles of mahogany, because the  two woods do not harmonize, although frequently wrongly combined.    HARD WOOD IMITATIONS.--It would be better to use, for instance, ash or  oak for one portion of the work, and a dark wood, like cherry or walnut,  for the other part; but usually a cherry cabinet should be made of  cherry throughout; while a curly maple chiffonier could not be improved  by having the legs of some other material.    These considerations should determine for you whether or not you can  safely use stains to represent different woods in the same article.    NATURAL EFFECTS.--If effects are wanted, the skilled workman will  properly rely upon the natural grain of the wood; hence, in staining,  you should try to imitate nature, because in staining you will depend  for contrast on the natural grain of the wood to help you out in  producing pleasing effects.    NATURAL WOOD STAINS.--It should be said, in general, however, that a  stain is, at best, a poor makeshift. There is nothing so pleasing as the  natural wood. It always has an appearance of cleanliness and openness.  To stain the wood shows an attempt to cover up cheapness by a cheap  contrivance. The exception to this rule is mahogany, which is generally  enriched by the application of a ruby tint which serves principally to  emphasize the beautiful markings of the wood.    POLISHING STAINED SURFACES.--If, on the other hand, you wish to go to  the labor of polishing the furniture to a high degree, staining becomes  an art, and will add to the beauty and durability of any soft or cheap  wood, excepting poplar.    When the article is highly polished, so a good, smooth surface is  provided, staining does not cheapen, but, on the other hand, serves to  embellish the article.    As a rule, therefore, it is well to inculcate this lesson: Do not stain  unless you polish; otherwise, it is far better to preserve the natural  color of the wood. One of the most beautiful sideboards I ever saw was  made of Oregon pine, and the natural wood, well filled and highly  polished. That finish gave it an effect which enhanced its value to a  price which equaled any cherry or mahogany product.          CHAPTER XVI    THE CARPENTER AND THE ARCHITECT      A carpenter has a trade; the architect a profession. It is not to be  assumed that one vocation is more honorable than the other. A  _profession_ is defined as a calling, or occupation, \"if not mechanical,  agricultural, or the like,\" to which one devotes himself and his  energies. A _trade_ is defined as an occupation \"which a person has  learned and engages in, especially mechanical employment, as  distinguished from the liberal arts,\" or the learned professions.    _Opportunity_ is the great boon in life. To the ambitious young man the  carpenter's trade offers a field for venturing into the learned  professions by a route which cannot be equaled in any other pursuit. In  his work he daily enters into contact with problems which require  mathematics of the highest order, geometry, the methods of calculating  strains and stresses, as well as laying out angles and curves.    This is a trade wherein he must keep in mind many calculations as to  materials, number, size, and methods of joining; he must remember all  the small details which go to make up the entire structure. This  exercise necessitates a mental picture of the finished product. His  imagination is thus directed to concrete objects. As the mind develops,  it becomes creative in its character, and the foundation is laid for a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20771"],[0,"Species Plantarum, Sections I-III (#18)"],[1,"_Bauh. pin. 5. theatr. 70._      Spartum austriacum. _Clus. hist. 2. p. 221._      Habitat in _Austria_, _Gallia_.
