This has been going on for so long, and it got so I  couldn't stand it another minute. How would you like it not to know who  you are?\"    \"Not very much, I'm afraid,\" said Ruth, softly.    \"That, in a way, is why it has been such a relief to be in the moving  pictures,\" Estelle went on. \"I could be so many different characters,  and, at times, I thought perhaps, by chance, I might be cast for the  very part I have lost--cast for my real self, as it were.\"    \"You must have had a hard time,\" said Alice.    \"I haven't told you half the story yet,\" Estelle went on. \"Would you  like to hear the rest?\"    \"Indeed we would!\" exclaimed Ruth. \"Not from any idle curiosity, but  because we want to help you.\"    \"And I do need some one to help me,\" murmured Estelle. \"I am all alone  in the world.\"    \"You must have relatives somewhere!\" insisted Alice.    \"None that I ever heard of. But then, who knows what might have happened  in the life that is a blank to me--in the life that lies beyond that  impenetrable wall of the past?    \"But I mustn't get hysterical again. Just let me think for a moment, so  I may tell you my story clearly. I shall be all right in a moment or  two.\"    \"Let me make you a cup of tea,\" proposed Ruth. \"I'll make some for all  of us,\" and presently the little kettle was steaming over the spirit  lamp, and the girls were sipping the fragrant beverage.    \"Thank you. That was good!\" murmured Estelle. \"I feel better now. I'll  tell the rest of my miserable story to you.\"    \"Don't make it too miserable,\" and Alice tried to make her laugh a gay  one.    \"I won't--not any more so than I can help. I think it will do me good to  let you share the mystery with me.\"    \"Then it is a mystery?\" asked Ruth.    \"Somewhat, yes. You may think it strange, but I can not think back more  than three years--four at the most. I am not at all certain of the time.  But go back as far as I can, all I remember is that I was on a large  steamer.\"    \"On the ocean?\" asked Alice.    \"No, on the Great Lakes. I was going to Cleveland, which I learned when  I asked one of the officers.\"    \"And didn't you know where you were going before you asked?\" Ruth  questioned.    \"I hadn't the least idea, my dear. I might just as well have been going  to Europe. In fact, when I first looked out and saw the water, I thought  I was on the ocean.\"    \"But where did you come from, what were you doing there, where were your  people?\" cried Ruth.    \"That's it, my dear. Where were they? I didn't know. No one knew. All I  could grasp was the fact that I was there on the boat.\"    \"Alone?\"    \"Yes, all alone.\"    \"But who bought your ticket--who engaged your stateroom?\" questioned  Ruth.    \"That is the queer part of it. I did it myself. When I first became  conscious that I was in a strange place I was so shocked that I wanted  to scream--to cry out--to ask all sorts of questions. Then I realized if  I did that I might be taken for an insane person and be locked up. So I  just shut myself in my stateroom and did some thinking.    \"The first thing I wanted to know was how I got on the steamer, but how  to find that out without asking questions that the steamship people  would think peculiar, was a puzzle to me. Finally, I decided to pretend  to want to change my room, and when I went to the purser I asked him if  that was the only room to be had.    \"'Why no, Miss,' he said, 'but when you came on board and I told you  what rooms I had, you insisted on taking that one.' That was enough for  me. I realized then that I had come on board alone, and of my own  volition, though I had not any recollection of having done so, and I  knew no more of where I came from than you do now.\"    \"How very strange!\" murmured Alice. \"And what did you do?\"    \"Well, I pretended that I had been tired and had not made a wise choice  of a room, and asked the purser to give me another.    \"'I thought, when you picked it out, you wouldn't like that one,' he  said to me, 'but you looked like a young lady who was used to having her  own way, so I did not interfere.'    \"That was another bit of information. Evidently, I looked prosperous, a  fact that was borne out when I examined my purse. I had a considerable  sum in it, and the large valise I found in my room was filled with  expensive clothes and fittings. Yet where I had obtained it or my money  or my clothes I could not tell for the life of me. All I knew was that  I was there on board the ship.\"    \"And did you change your stateroom?\" asked Ruth.    \"Yes; the purser gave me another one. And then I sat down and tried to  puzzle it out. Why was I going to Cleveland? I knew no one there, and  yet I had bought a ticket to that port--or some one had bought it for  me.\"    \"Did that occur to you?\" asked Alice. \"That some one might have had an  object in getting you out of the way.\"    \"Well, if they had, they took a very public and expensive method of  doing it,\" Estelle said. \"I was on one of the best boats on Lake Erie,  and I had plenty of money.\"    \"Did you find in what name your room was taken?\" asked Ruth. \"That might  have given you a clue.\"    \"The name given was Estelle Brown,\" was the answer. \"I gave that name  myself, for I recognized my handwriting on the envelope in which I  sealed some of my jewelry before handing it to the purser to put in his  safe. Estelle Brown was the name I gave.\"    \"And was it yours?\" asked Alice.    \"I haven't any reason to believe that it was not. In fact, as I looked  back then, and as I look back now, the name Estelle Brown seems to be  my very own--it is associated closely with me. So I'm sure I'm Estelle  Brown--that is the only part I am sure about.\"    \"But what did you do?\" asked Ruth. \"Didn't you make some inquiries?\"    \"I did; as soon as I reached Cleveland. At first I hoped that my memory  would come back to me when I reached that place. I thought I might  recognize some of the buildings. In fact, I hoped it would prove to be  my home, from which I had, perhaps, wandered in a fit of illness.    \"But it was of no help to me. I might just as well have been in San  Francisco or New York for all that the place was familiar to me. So I  gave that up. Then I began to look over the papers to see if any Estelle  Brown was missing. But there was nothing to that effect in the news  columns. All the while I was getting more and more worried.    \"I went to a good hotel in Cleveland and stayed two or three days. Then  I happened to think that perhaps my clothes might offer some clue. I  examined them all carefully, and the only thing I found was the name of  a Boston firm on a toilet set. At once it flashed on me that I belonged  in Boston. I seemed to have a dim recollection of a big monument in the  midst of a green park, of narrow, crooked streets and historical  buildings.    \"Then, in a flash it came to me--I did belong in Boston. How I had come  from there I could not guess, but I was sure I lived there. So I bought  a ticket for there and went as fast as the train could take me.    \"But my hopes were dashed. Even the sight of Bunker Hill monument did  not bring the elusive memory, nor did viewing the other places of  historic interest. Yet, somewhere in the back of my brain, I was sure I  had been in that city before. I went to the place where my toilet set  was bought, but the man had sold out and the new owner could give me no  information.    \"I did not know what to do. My money was running low, and I had not a  friend to whom to turn. I happened to go in to see some moving pictures,  and the idea came to me that perhaps I could act. I had rather a good  face, so some one had hinted.\"    \"You do photograph beautifully,\" said Alice.    \"That's what one of the managers in Boston told me when I applied to  him,\" said Estelle. \"He gave me a small part, and then I learned that  New York was really the place to go to get in the movies, so I came on,  with a letter to a manager from the Boston firm.    \"It must have been my face that got me my first engagement, for now I  know I couldn't act. But, somehow or other, I made good, and then I got  this engagement with Mr. Pertell.    \"And that is my story. You can see what a strange one it is--for me not  to know who I am. I'm almost ashamed to admit it, and that is why I have  been avoiding all references to my past. But now I have told you, what  do you think?\"    \"I think it's just terrible!\" cried Alice. \"The idea! Not to know who  you are.\"    \"The question is,\" said Ruth, \"what can we do to help you? This must not  be allowed to go any further. Valuable time is being lost. We want to  help you, Estelle. What can we do? We must try to find out who you are.\"    \"Yes, but how can you?\" asked the strange girl.          CHAPTER XIX    A BIG GUN      Ruth did not answer for several seconds. She seemed to be thinking  deeply, and Alice, who was fairly bursting with numberless questions she  wanted to ask, respected her sister's efforts to bring some logical  queries to the fore.    \"Then your hopes that Boston would prove to be your home were not borne  out?\" asked Ruth, after a bit.    \"No, but even yet I feel sure that I have lived at least part of my life  in Boston, or near there. One doesn't have even shadowy memories of big  monuments and historic places without some basis; and it was not the  memory of having seen pictures of them. It was a real vision.\"    \"And the name Estelle Brown?\"    \"Oh, I'm sure that belongs to me. It seems a very part of myself.\"    \"Did you tell any of this to Mr. Pertell or to the other moving picture  managers?\" asked Alice.    \"No. You are the first persons to whom I have told my secret,\" Estelle  said. \"I was afraid if I mentioned it they might make it public for  advertising purposes, you know. They might make public the fact that a  young actress was looking for herself "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20386"],[0,"Embroidery and Tapestry Weaving (#18)"],[1,"of this may be because it is worked by counting the threads of  the fabric, or because the pattern is always treated as a diaper and  placed upon the surface without regard to contour. The exception to this  rule of direction is when the couching is taken along a stem or the  narrow hem of a robe to form the border, or along a girdle, it then  follows the direction of the band, this being evidently the most  straightforward and satisfactory method to use for the purpose.    [Illustration: Fig. 129. Front. Back.]    The _point couche rentre ou retire_ is an excellent method to use for  working a raised bar. Fig. 129 shows the front and reverse sides of a  bar worked by it. The gold thread comes cleanly through from the back of  the material instead of being clumsily doubled upon the surface, and the  durability is evidently great. The linen thread, it will be seen, runs  to and fro at the back, at each turn securing the gold thread.    [Illustration: Fig. 130.]    In fig. 130 this couching is to be seen in use upon drapery. It is taken  entirely over the exterior surface of the cloak, and upon the crown,  sceptre, and model of the church. The lines expressing the folds of  drapery are in this case shown by the couching at these places being  taken in a different direction. Fine gold passing is used for the  couched thread, much finer than can possibly be shown in the drawing,  and the pattern chosen for the couching down is a chevron. The other  parts of the work are done with silk thread in a fine chain or split  stitch. The play of light upon the varied surface of the golden cloak is  very beautiful; the drawing of the figure is perhaps primitive, and,  regarded from the draughtsman's point of view, somewhat ludicrous; it is  however sufficiently good to express all that its author intended, and  there is something very human in this dignified little king who would  not have you forget that he founded a church. The king who is  personified here is Edward the Confessor, so the church is Westminster  Abbey, of which he was the founder.    [Illustration: Fig. 131.]    The Madonna and child forming the frontispiece of the work is another  example of this couching. The method of expressing the folds of drapery  is slightly different from that employed upon the king's robes. All  drapery carried out in this stitch is worked in somewhat the same  fashion, that is, the couching running to and fro between the lines  marks each fold as roughly shown at fig. 131. This method leaves an  indented line to express the drapery, which is a more satisfactory way  than a simple line of dark colour worked over the gold, as in more  modern work. The indented line is often further emphasised by a line of  dark silk stitched along it, which is done in this case. The figures  are taken from the Jesse cope in the Victoria and Albert Museum;[12]  this vestment, with its red silk background and its finely coloured and  drawn ancestors of Christ posed amongst encircling vine branches, is a  most beautiful, though sadly mutilated, example of XIIIth century design  and workmanship.      MODERN METHOD OF COUCHING    In the usual form of couching the gold thread is attached to the  material by fine strong silk. The thread is fastened down as a rule  two-fold, sometimes even three-fold; this method is both quicker and  more effective than couching each thread separately. As the couching  thread is necessarily in evidence, decorative use is often made of it as  well as practical; the stitches, for instance, may be planned so as to  carry out some pattern (see fig. 132) instead of being put down at  random. There is no limit to the variety of the patterns that can be  devised in this way.    Decorative use can be made of the colour of the couching thread; a hot  colour warms the tone of the gold and a cool one does the reverse; and  the more contrasting the colour the more it is in evidence.    [Illustration: Fig. 132.]    [Illustration: Fig. 133.]    The gold thread may be couched solidly in straight lines, as the above  figure shows, or it may be arranged in wavy lines either close or open,  as in fig. 133. The thread is waved by bending it round the pointed end  of a piercer just before fixing down. This waving line is particularly  suitable for the gold thread, since the slight change in direction  allows the light to play upon the metal very prettily. For this reason  gold is often couched solidly in circular or shell form over a ground.  In gold embroidery, therefore, the direction of the thread is a  specially important matter.    [Illustration: Fig. 134.]    At the end of a line a technical difficulty sometimes arises in the  turning of the thread, which is apt to be clumsy. This difficulty is  overcome in various ways; the most usual is to return the doubled thread  as neatly as possible and continue the next line; another is to cut the  thread sharp off, secure it close to the end with a double stitch, and  recommence in like fashion; the thread can sometimes be passed through  to the back and brought up in position for working the next line. The  fine point of a leaf may present difficulties in the same way; sometimes  one of the two threads is temporarily let slip and the point completed  with the single one, the left thread being picked up upon the return  (see fig. 134). For such occasions as this it is more practical to wind  the two threads of passing upon separate bobbins, and bring them  together at the working. Another way of overcoming the point difficulty  is shown at fig. 135.      RAISED WORK    The couched gold threads may be raised in parts by means of some kind of  padding interposed between it and the ground. They are very effective so  treated, since the raised metal catches and reflects the light in a  pleasing manner. This raising of the thread, however, has been carried  to such extremes as to resemble goldsmith's work rather than embroidery,  and it is then hardly in good taste.    [Illustration: Fig. 135.]    A simple method of raising the gold is to lay down lines of string at  stated intervals over the ground. The well-known form called basket  stitch is done in this way; fig. 136 illustrates this stitch, a part of  the square is left unworked in order to expose the under-layer of  string. To carry out the diagram--First couch down the lines of string  at regular intervals over the surface, then commence laying on the gold  by carrying a doubled thread of passing over two bars of string, and  there fixing it down to the material, then over two more and fixing it  down again, and so on to the end of the line. This is exactly repeated  for a second line of passing, then, for the next two lines, commence by  carrying the passing for the first stitch over one bar only, and for the  remainder of the line over the two as before. This process repeated  makes the wicker-like pattern so frequently seen in gold work. It can be  used as a filling or as a border. It is evident that with the same  arrangement of strings many other patterns could be carried out by  varying the points of couching down.    [Illustration: Fig. 136.]    Another way in which string is used for padding the gold is illustrated  in fig. 137. The pattern, which in the first part is two diamond shapes  and a border line, is laid down in string. The doubled gold thread is  then taken horizontally to and fro in close parallel lines over the part  to be worked, and fixed by couching stitches at necessary intervals;  wherever else these stitches may be put, one must always be placed upon  each side of a raised line to make it sharp and clear. Other kinds of  padding are used in this method of work; for instance, a lozenge shape  may be stuffed with layers of soft cotton, as shown in the second part  of this same diagram. Sometimes most complicated patterns are laid down  in string and covered with gold thread in this way, _e.g._:--fig. 138  shows an interlacing pattern taken from the border of an orphrey upon a  XVth century chasuble.    [Illustration: Fig. 137.]      THE USE OF FANCY GOLD THREADS    A cursory glance must be given to the use of purls and other fancy  threads, but these are mostly used nowadays for badges on uniforms, or  for masonic purposes, and are carried out by the trade. These threads,  when tarnished, are very difficult to clean, they easily turn a bad  colour and catch the dust, and for real embroidery purposes are not as  satisfactory as the plainer threads.    [Illustration: Fig. 138.]    Purl and bullion must be cut very accurately into pieces of the required  size, and attached to the material as a bead would be. The metal must be  as little as possible touched with the fingers; the cut pieces can be  placed upon a tray lined with some soft springy substance, such as felt,  in order to be easily picked up with the point of the needle, and they  can be adjusted to their right position upon the work by the aid of the  flat end of the piercer; unnecessary handling may be avoided in this  way.    These threads, laid over padding either straight across or at an angle,  may be used for the stems or petals of conventional flowers. The various  kinds, dull, bright, and check, may perhaps be used in succession.    Plate is frequently taken to and fro over the same kind of forms over a  prepared padding, being caught down by a stitch on each side by a method  the French call _le guipe_. It needs skill and practice to do this well.  Crinkled plate used to be couched on to work, but now is not much used  in this way.    Pearl purl is most often seen outlining a form filled in with the other  threads; an enlarged example of this thread lies vertically down the  centre of fig. 139, the end of it is pulled out, in order to show the  formation of the thread.    [Illustration: Fig. 139.]    Spangles are usually sewn down separately; they may be attached by  stitches from the centre outwards or by the thread being passed through  a"]]]
