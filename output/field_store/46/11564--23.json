A committee of nurserymen having gone to see this variety  returned with the report that the half had not been told concerning this  great berry. Wanting to keep up with the times, I decided to plant some  of this variety in the spring. The yield from these plants was immense,  and the berries large, but unlike the Marlboro already mentioned they  could not be picked until very dark and real ripe. This variety was more  subject to anthracnose than any I had seen, and served to give me a  thorough understanding of the various raspberry diseases, which I had  heretofore blamed to the drouth. The leaves would dry up and the berries  become small and crumbly when affected by anthracnose. It might be said  of this variety as regards public favor, that it went up like a rocket  and came down equally fast.    I next tried the Thompson Early as an experiment, but this variety  proved a failure, or at least a disappointment. These berries ripened  very slowly, just a few at a time, and did not compare favorably with  either the Marlboro or the Loudon.    A party close by had at this time planted out a large field of a variety  of raspberry which I had not seen before. These plants produced a large  berry, more like a blackberry in appearance. Having by this time had  experience with so many kinds of raspberries, I examined this new  variety carefully, and all in all decided that this was the coming  berry. Here, too, I also noticed the first signs of disease. The plants  had only begun to bear fruit, however, and judging from the strong,  tall canes, they looked good for at least fifteen years. This disease,  however, practically destroyed the entire field within two years. Before  too badly diseased, I had obtained and planted out a couple of acres of  these plants and immediately began spraying them. The following spring I  sprayed them again, and although the plants became perfectly healthy, I  sprayed them once or twice during the summer, and it is needless to say  the result was a berry which, considering all its good points, was  certainly deserving of the name it bore, which was \"King.\" In fact, I do  not hope to see anything better in the raspberry line during the next  thirty years, that is, any seedling having all its merits: a strong  growth, hardiness of cane, an immense bearer and a good shipper. It's  only fault is that the berries will drop from the plants when real ripe,  but if you are on the job this can easily be averted.    As far as anthracnose is concerned, I have found that there is not a  variety of raspberry standing out in an open field, unsprayed or partly  shaded, that will stand up under a heavy crop without being affected by  this disease.    After increasing my plantation, as I had by this time, I found I  required more help. Ability in managing my helpers was a necessity. My  experience with them in the field was that when I set them to hoeing a  newly set raspberry field if not watched they would destroy half the  roots, loosening the little hold the struggling plants had, by cutting  close and hoeing the soil away from the roots. I have seen supposedly  intelligent men plowing alongside of the plants, thinking they were  doing their work so much more thoroughly, but if they would dig up one  plant before plowing and another after, they would readily see the  results of their plowing.    A born farmer assumes that everybody knows how to handle a hoe or a  plow, but why should they, not having had practical experience? When put  to work such as hoeing, they would make the most outlandish motions with  the hoe, often destroying valuable plants, not being able to distinguish  them from the weeds. Though they may labor just as hard, they cannot  possibly accomplish as much as the expert who can skillfully whirl a hoe  around a plant in such a manner as to remove every weed and yet not  injure the plant in the least. In other words, the best efforts of the  novice cannot possibly bring the results so easily accomplished by the  more skillful laborer. Except in a few cases, I have found inexperienced  help a discouragement.    In hiring pickers who had to come quite far each morning, I found that  if the morning had been wet and rainy, but had later turned out to be a  nice day, they would not come at all. The sun coming out after these  showers would cause the berries to become over-ripe and to drop from the  bushes, or if still on the bush would be too ripe for shipping. These  same pickers, when berries were scarce, would rush through the rows,  merely picking the biggest and those most easily acquired.    Having tried pickers as mentioned, I decided that to get pickers from  the city and board them would be the better plan. While they seemed to  work more for the pleasure connected with life on the farm than with the  idea of making money, yet after a little training and a few rules, most  of them would make splendid pickers, and my berries being carefully  picked and in first class condition, would readily sell to the best  trade.    Leaving the subject of berries and berry picking, I will dwell briefly  on my experience with the winter covering of the plants. At first I  would cover the canes in an arch-like manner, which would require more  than 18 inches of soil to cover them, and it was necessary to shovel  much by hand. In the spring I found it quite a task to remove all this  soil and get it back in place between the rows. After I learned to cover  them properly, that is flat on the ground, I found it required but a  small amount of soil to cover them, and in the spring it was only  necessary to use a fork to remove the covering, and with a little lift  they were ready to start growth again.    After getting more and more fruit, I found I could not dispose of it in  the home market, and tending to the picking and packing of the fruit did  not leave enough time to warrant my peddling it. I had been advised to  ship my berries to two or three different commission houses in order to  see where I could obtain the best results. I frequently divided my  shipments into three parts: consequently some of my fruit would meet in  competition with another lot of my fruit, and not only would one concern  ask a higher or lower price than the other, but they would not know when  to expect my shipments, which they would receive on alternate days. I  finally came to the conclusion that I would send all my fruit to one  party, and I found that it was not only more of an object to them, but  people would come every day to buy some, knowing they were getting the  same quality each time.    Although it has been my experience that the raspberry is never a  failure, still I have found that it is a good policy not to depend  entirely on the raspberry, but to extend the plantation in such a way as  to have a continuous supply of fruits and vegetables in season, from the  asparagus and pie plant of the early spring to the very latest variety  of the grape and apple ripening just before the heavy frost of fall,  when it is again time to tuck them all away for the winter.    Mr. Ludlow: Do I understand that you have to lay down and cover up those  red raspberries?    Mr. Johnson: Yes, sir; otherwise you only get a few berries right at the  top of the cane, and if you cover them the berries will be all along  down the cane.    The President: Do you break off many canes by covering them?    Mr. Johnson: No, it is the way you bend them. When you bend them down,  make a kind of a twist and hold your hand right near them. You can bend  them down as quick as a couple of men can shovel them down.    Mr. Anderson: Do you bend them north or south or any way?    Mr. Johnson: I generally bend one row one way and the other the other  way. Where you want to cultivate, it is easier for cultivation; you  don't have to go against the bend of those plants. That bend will never  be straight again, and when you come to cultivate you are liable to rub  them.    Mr. Anderson: How far have you got yours planted apart?    Mr. Johnson: About five feet.    Mr. Sauter: What is your best raspberry?    Mr. Johnson: I haven't seen anything better than the King.    Mr. Sauter: Do you cover the King?    Mr. Johnson: Yes.    Mr. Sauter: We don't do it on the experimental station. I never covered  mine, and I think I had the best all around berry last summer.    Mr. Johnson: That might be all right when they are young, but I find it  pays me.    A Member: Don't they form new branches on the sides when you pinch off  the ends?    Mr. Johnson: Yes, sir; then you pinch them off.    A Member: Don't they break right off from the main stalk in laying down?    Mr. Johnson: No, no.    A Member: We have a great deal of trouble with that. How do you get  these bushy bushes to lie down?    Mr. Johnson: I take three or four canes, and kind of twist them, give  them a little twist, and lay them flat on the ground.    Mr. Anderson: Don't you take out any dirt on the sides?    Mr. Johnson: No, sir; sometimes I might put a shovel of ground against  them to bend the canes over.    Mr. Rogers: Do you plant in the hedge row or in the hill system?    Mr. Johnson: In the hedge row. I think it is better because they protect  one another.    Mr. Ludlow: How far do you put them apart in the hedge row?    Mr. Johnson: Four feet. That is the trouble with the King, if you don't  keep them down, your rows will get too wide.    A Member: I heard you say a while ago you covered these. Do you plow  them after you get them down or do you cover them with a shovel?    Mr. Johnson: I cover mostly with a shovel. Sometimes I take a small plow  through.    A Member: Don't you think in covering them with a plow you might disturb  the roots?    Mr. Johnson: That is the danger.    A Member: I saw a fellow covering up twelve acres of black caps and he  plowed them shut. After I heard what you said I thought maybe that he  was injuring his roots.

And the people were told that several times each year they  were to bring their sacrifices to the temple at Jerusalem. Those were  also good days for the common people. There was a king now who \"judged  the cause of the poor and the needy.\" Many a poor debtor, when his  crops failed, appealed to the king's court in Jerusalem and he himself  and his children were saved from slavery and their home from ruin.    The reform only lasted a few years--some twelve or thirteen--and then  King Josiah was killed in battle, and much of the old heathenism and  greed and injustice came back again in a flood. But the memory of the  good days did not quickly fade. It was the first great triumph of the  teachings of the prophets--the men who kept alive the true ideals of  Abraham and Moses.

What place is referred to by the  author, when he writes, \"The place that Jehovah your God shall choose,  to cause his name to dwell there\"?    3. In the light of the history in this chapter, which is the more  likely to change human history, a battleship or a Bible class?  Explain.          CHAPTER XX    A PROPHET WHO WOULD NOT COMPROMISE      The new law-book seemed a great victory. Yet sometimes victories are  more dangerous than defeats. They lead to self-satisfaction. This was  certainly the case with this victory of the authors of Deuteronomy.  The people were careful to offer up their sacrifices at the temple in  Jerusalem, and very few offerings were brought to the old village  shrines. But the real kernel of the truth which the prophets had  proclaimed was in danger of being forgotten. This was the truth that  _no_ forms of sacrifice, _no_ solemn religious feasts are of any  account in the sight of God unless accompanied by simple justice and  brotherly kindness between neighbors. This was the state of affairs  against which one more great reforming prophet was raised up to  fight--Jeremiah, of the little town of Anathoth, five miles north of  Jerusalem.      A CONVERSATION IN A JERUSALEM STREET    To understand clearly what Jeremiah's message was and why it was  needed let us listen to a conversation between two citizens of  Jerusalem. This one is imaginary. But there must have been many, in  reality, very similar to this.    _First citizen:_ Did you hear of my good fortune? I have just got a  fine piece of ground for almost nothing.    _Second citizen:_ How?    _First citizen:_ I had loaned some money to an old farmer, and made  him pledge me his field as security. Last summer the Babylonian  soldiers came through that valley and burned all the wheat and barley  stacks. So the old man couldn't pay back the loan. He tried to tell  his story to King Jehoiakim, but the king drove him from the palace.  So I went and took his field.    _Second citizen:_ What would the prophets have said to a transaction  like that? Did not Isaiah call down woes from Jehovah on those who  took away poor men's fields?    _First citizen:_ I have just offered a sacrifice to Jehovah.    _Second citizen:_ I suppose, then, it is all right. But did not the  prophets speak against sacrifice, unless one remembered justice and  mercy?    _First citizen:_ Yes, but they were speaking of the old sacrifices on  the \"high places,\" at the village shrines. Everyone knows they were  heathen shrines and hateful to Jehovah. I offered my sacrifice at the  temple yonder, just as we are told to do in the law of Moses, which  King Josiah's servants found in the temple.    Look! Why is all that crowd gathered over there in the temple yard?  Let us go and see what is happening. I heard some one say, that a  certain Jeremiah who calls himself a prophet, was to speak there  to-day. All my friends who have heard him say that he is a false  prophet.    (They reach the edge of the crowd. Jeremiah is standing on the steps  of the temple, addressing the people, as follows:)        =\"Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the      Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are      these. For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings;      if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his      neighbor; if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and      the widow ... then I will cause you to dwell in this place,      in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even      forevermore. Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot      profit. Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear      falsely, ... and come and stand before me in this house, ...      and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these      abominations? Is this house, which is called by my name,      become a den of robbers in your eyes?\"=      JEREMIAH'S MESSAGE OF A HEART RELIGION    It is clear that Jeremiah was fighting the same old battle that Amos  and the other prophets had fought against a religion of mere empty  ceremonies. But the battle had grown even harder, because the old  false practices had been accepted as though they were just the kind of  religion that Amos had preached. The people said, \"We are keeping the  law of Jehovah,\" and so they were satisfied with themselves.    =The law to be written on the heart.=--Jeremiah saw that this mistake  had come from relying too much on a written law. Something more than  an outward law was needed before men could succeed in living together  as brothers. It is so easy to keep the letter of the law, or to think  one is keeping it, while we lose the spirit of it. What is needed,  Jeremiah said, is a changed heart. Again and again he cried to the  people, \"Oh Jerusalem, cleanse thy _heart_.\" And in one of the great  chapters of the Bible, the thirty-first of the book of Jeremiah, he  looks forward to a time when Jehovah and his people should be bound  together in a new covenant--not a covenant written on tables of stone  like the one which Moses wrote at Sinai:        =\"But this is the covenant that I will make ... after those      days, saith the Lord. I will put my law in their inward      parts, and in their hearts I will write it.\"=    The apostle Paul saw this promise fulfilled by the love which Jesus  Christ awakens in men's hearts, so that they gladly and eagerly do the  will of God. On account of this prophecy of Jeremiah our Christian  Bible is called the New Covenant, or (from the Latin) the New  Testament.      JEREMIAH AND THE BABYLONIANS    In Jeremiah's time (a decade or so before and after B.C. 600) the  Babylonians had taken the place of the Assyrians as the rulers of the  world. There was a powerful king, Nebuchadrezzar, on the throne of  Babylon. And the existence of the kingdom of Judah depended on  submission to him. But, just as in Isaiah's time a century before,  there was now a party in Jerusalem who were constantly plotting to  rebel against the Babylonians, hoping for help from Egypt.    =Jeremiah as a patriot.=--Jeremiah had no sympathy with them. He loved  his native land deeply and tenderly. But until the people were  _worthy_ of liberty he was sure Jehovah would not give it to them.    Again and again they proved their unworthiness. Once when the  Babylonian armies were knocking almost at the gates of Jerusalem they  remembered that law about Hebrew slaves, which had been made even  more strict in the new law, Deuteronomy. According to this law, no  Hebrew could be kept in slavery longer than seven years. So in their  fear of the Babylonians these rich nobles solemnly set free a great  number of slaves whom they had been illegally keeping in slavery. A  few days later the hostile army, for some reason or other, withdrew.  And within a month all these slaves who had been set free were seized  and reenslaved. How Jeremiah denounced this hypocrisy!      THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM    If Jeremiah's advice had been followed, the people of Judah would have  been spared a world of sorrow. But the leaders of the kingdom seemed  bent on dragging the whole nation into ruin. In B.C. 597, Jerusalem  was captured and some ten thousand of the inhabitants were carried  away as exiles to Babylon.    Even that lesson was not enough. Within a few years the new king,  Zedekiah, and his nobles again rebelled against Nebuchadrezzar.  Jeremiah protested and was called a traitor. Many times his life was  threatened; for a long period he was kept in a filthy dungeon, and  almost perished from hunger. But friends saved him. Very soon, in B.C.  586, the city came to the horrible end which Jeremiah had so patiently  tried to ward off. The city was captured by Babylonian soldiers and  burned. Thousands were carried away as exiles. Thousands more fled to  Egypt and to other foreign countries. Only the poorest farmers were  left to till the soil. David's kingdom and dynasty were ended.    Jeremiah himself was not taken to Babylon, but remained in Palestine.  According to tradition, his last days were spent in Egypt, with a  Hebrew colony there. His life had been spent in keeping alive the soul  of true religion in an age when few would listen. He is one of the  great heroes of uncompromising truth.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Look up the story of Jeremiah in the Bible dictionary.    2. Read Jeremiah 1. 1-9, for a taste of his style of writing.    3. One man sacrifices to a heathen god; another tries to bribe Jehovah  with a sacrifice as though he were _like_ the heathen gods:        _a._ Which is worse?      _b._ Which would the authors of Deuteronomy have considered worse?      _c._ Which would Jeremiah have considered worse?          CHAPTER XXI    KEEPING THE FAITH IN A STRANGE LAND      Twice within twelve years, first in B.C. 597, and again in B.C. 586,  the Babylonians took great companies of Hebrews as exiles from  Jerusalem to Babylon.
