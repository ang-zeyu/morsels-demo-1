BRIBERY (from the O. Fr. _briberie_, begging or vagrancy, _bribe_, Mid.  Lat. _briba_, signifying a piece of bread given to beggars; the Eng.  \"bribe\" has passed through the meanings of alms, blackmail and extortion,  to gifts received or given in order to influence corruptly). The public  offence of bribery may be defined as the offering or giving of payment in  some shape or form that it may be a motive in the performance of functions  for which the proper motive ought to be a conscientious sense of duty. When  this is superseded by the sordid impulses created by the bribe, a person is  said to be corrupted, and thus corruption is a term sometimes held  equivalent to bribery. The offence may be divided into two great  classes--the one where a person invested with power is induced by payment  to use it unjustly; the other, where power is obtained by purchasing the  suffrages of those who can impart it. It is a natural propensity, removable  only by civilization or some powerful counteracting influence, to feel that  every element of power is to be employed as much as possible for the  owner's own behoof, and that its benefits should be conferred not on those  who best deserve them, but on those who will pay most for them. Hence  judicial corruption is an inveterate vice of imperfect civilization. There  is, perhaps no other crime on which the force of law, if unaided by public  opinion and morals, can have so little influence; for in other crimes, such  as violence or fraud, there is generally some person immediately injured by  the act, who can give his aid in the detection of the offender, but in the  perpetration of the offence of bribery all the immediate parties obtain  what they desire, and are satisfied.    The purification of the bench from judicial bribery has been gradual in  most of the European countries. In France it received an impulse in the  16th century from the high-minded chancellor, Michel de L'Hopital. In  England judicial corruption has been a crime of remarkable rarity. Indeed,  with the exception of a statute of 1384 (repealed by the Statute Law  Revision Act 1881) there has been no legislation relating to judicial  bribery. The earliest recorded case was that of Sir William Thorpe, who in  1351 was fined and removed from office for accepting bribes. Other  celebrated cases were those of Michael de la Pole, chancellor of England,  in 1387; Lord Chancellor Bacon in 1621; Lionel Cranfield, earl of  Middlesex, in 1624; and Sir Thomas Parker, 1st earl of Macclesfield, in  1725. In Scotland for some years after the Revolution the bench was not  without a suspicion of interested partiality; but since the beginning of  the 19th century, at least, there has been in all parts of the empire a  perfect reliance on its purity. The same may be said of the higher class of  ministerial officers. There is no doubt that in the period from the  Revolution to the end of Queen Anne's reign, when a speaker of the House of  Commons was expelled for bribery, and the great Marlborough could not clear  his character from pecuniary dishonesty, there was much corruption in the  highest official quarters. The level of the offence of official bribery has  gradually descended, until it has become an extremely rare thing for the  humbler officers connected with the revenue to be charged with it. It has  had a more lingering existence with those who, because their power is more  of a constitutional than an official character, have been deemed less  responsible to the public. During Walpole's administration there is no  doubt that members of parliament were paid in cash for votes; and the  memorable saying, that every man has his price, has been preserved as a  characteristic indication of his method of government. One of the forms in  which administrative corruption is most difficult of eradication is the  appointment to office. It is sometimes maintained that the purity which  characterizes the administration of justice is here unattainable, because  in giving a judgment there is but one form in which it can be justly given,  but when an office has to be filled many people may be equally fitted for  it, and personal motives must influence a choice. It very rarely happens,  however, that direct bribery is supposed to influence such appointments. It  does not appear that bribery was conspicuous in England until, in the early  part of the 18th century, constituencies had thrown off the feudal  dependence which lingered among them; and, indeed, it is often said, that  bribery is essentially the defect of a free people, since it is the sale of  that which is taken from others without payment.    In English law bribery of a privy councillor or a juryman (see EMBRACERY)  is punishable as a misdemeanour, as is the taking of a bribe by any  judicial or ministerial officer. The buying and selling of public offices  is also regarded at common law as a form of bribery. By the Customs  Consolidation Act 1876, any officer in the customs service is liable to  instant dismissal and a penalty of L500 for taking a bribe, and any person  offering or promising a bribe or reward to an officer to neglect his duty  or conceal or connive at any act by which the customs may be evaded shall  forfeit the sum of L200. Under the Inland Revenue Regulations Act 1890, the  bribery of commissioners, collectors, officers or other persons employed in  relation to the Inland Revenue involves a fine of L500. The Merchant  Shipping Act 1894, ss. 112 and 398, makes provision for certain offences in  the nature of bribery. Bribery is, by the Extradition Act 1906, [v.04  p.0517] an extraditable offence. Administrative corruption was dealt with  in the Public Bodies' Corrupt Practices Act 1889. The public bodies  concerned are county councils, town or borough councils, boards,  commissioners, select vestries and other bodies having local government,  public health or poor law powers, and having for those purposes to  administer rates raised under public general acts. The giving or receiving,  promising, offering, soliciting or agreeing to receive any gift, fee, loan  or advantage by any person as an inducement for any act or forbearance by a  member, officer or servant of a public body in regard to the affairs of  that body is made a misdemeanour in England and Ireland and a crime and  offence in Scotland. Prosecution under the act requires the consent of the  attorney or solicitor-general in England or Ireland and of the lord  advocate in Scotland. Conviction renders liable to imprisonment with or  without hard labour for a term not exceeding two years, and to a fine not  exceeding L500, in addition to or in lieu of imprisonment. The offender may  also be ordered to pay to the public body concerned any bribe received by  him; he may be adjudged incapable for seven years of holding public office,  _i.e._ the position of member, officer or servant of a public body; and if  already an officer or servant, besides forfeiting his place, he is liable  at the discretion of the court to forfeit his right to compensation or  pension. On a second conviction he may be adjudged forever incapable of  holding public office, and for seven years incapable of being registered or  of voting as a parliamentary elector, or as an elector of members of a  public body. An offence under the act may be prosecuted and punished under  any other act applicable thereto, or at common law; but no person is to be  punished twice for the same offence. Bribery at political elections was at  common law punishable by indictment or information, but numerous statutes  have been passed dealing with it as a \"corrupt practice.\" In this sense,  the word is elastic in meaning and may embrace any method of corruptly  influencing another for the purpose of securing his vote (see CORRUPT  PRACTICES). Bribery at elections of fellows, scholars, officers and other  persons in colleges, cathedral and collegiate churches, hospitals and other  societies was prohibited in 1588-1589 by statute (31 Eliz. c. 6). If a  member receives any money, fee, reward or other profit for giving his vote  in favour of any candidate, he forfeits his own place; if for any such  consideration he resigns to make room for a candidate, he forfeits double  the amount of the bribe, and the candidate by or on whose behalf a bribe is  given or promised is incapable of being elected on that occasion. The act  is to be read at every election of fellows, &c., under a penalty of L40 in  case of default. By the same act any person for corrupt consideration  presenting, instituting or inducting to an ecclesiastical benefice or  dignity forfeits two years' value of the benefice or dignity; the corrupt  presentation is void, and the right to present lapses for that turn to the  crown, and the corrupt presentee is disabled from thereafter holding the  same benefice or dignity; a corrupt institution or induction is void, and  the patron may present. For a corrupt resignation or exchange of a benefice  the giver and taker of a bribe forfeit each double the amount of the bribe.  Any person corruptly procuring the ordaining of ministers or granting of  licenses to preach forfeits L40, and the person so ordained forfeits L10  and for seven years is incapacitated from holding any ecclesiastical  benefice or promotion.    In the United States the offence of bribery is very severely dealt with. In  many states, bribery or the attempt to bribe is made a felony, and is  punishable with varying terms of imprisonment, in some jurisdictions it may  be with a period not exceeding ten years. The offence of bribery at  elections is dealt with on much the same lines as in England, voiding the  election and disqualifying the offender from holding any office.

Amid the smoky flare  of many lights, amid rising clouds of dust, a line of laden toilers  was crawling ant-like from the lighters into the bowels of the big  ship; and a second line, unladen, was descending by another gangway.  Above, the jewelled velvet of the sky swept in a glorious arc; beyond,  the lights of Port Said broke through the black curtain of the night,  and the moving ray from the lighthouse intermittently swept the  harbour waters; whilst, amid the indescribable clamour, the grimily  picturesque turmoil, so characteristic of the place, the liner took in  coal for her run to Rangoon.    Dodging this way and that, rounding the sterns of big ships, and  disputing the water-way with lesser craft, the boat made for shore.    The usual delay at the Custom House, the usual soothing of the excited  officials in the usual way, and his _arabiyeh_ was jolting Dr. Cairn  through the noise and the smell of those rambling streets, a noise and  a smell entirely peculiar to this clearing-house of the Near East.    He accepted the room which was offered to him at the hotel, without  troubling to inspect it, and having left instructions that he was to  be called in time for the early train to Cairo, he swallowed a whisky  and soda at the buffet, and wearily ascended the stairs. There were  tourists in the hotel, English and American, marked by a gaping  wonderment, and loud with plans of sightseeing; but Port Said, nay all  Egypt, had nothing of novelty to offer Dr. Cairn. He was there at  great inconvenience; a practitioner of his repute may not easily  arrange to quit London at a moment's notice. But the business upon  which he was come was imperative. For him the charm of the place had  not existence, but somewhere in Egypt his son stood in deadly peril,  and Dr. Cairn counted the hours that yet divided them. His soul was up  in arms against the man whose evil schemes had led to his presence in  Port Said, at a time when many sufferers required his ministrations in  Half-Moon Street. He was haunted by a phantom, a ghoul in human shape;  Antony Ferrara, the adopted son of his dear friend, the adopted son,  who had murdered his adopter, who whilst guiltless in the eyes of the  law, was blood-guilty in the eyes of God!    Dr. Cairn switched on the light and seated himself upon the side of  the bed, knitting his brows and staring straight before him, with an  expression in his clear grey eyes whose significance he would have  denied hotly, had any man charged him with it. He was thinking of  Antony Ferrara's record; the victims of this fiendish youth (for  Antony Ferrara was barely of age) seemed to stand before him with  hands stretched out appealingly.    \"You alone,\" they seemed to cry, \"know who and what he is! You alone  know of our awful wrongs; you alone can avenge them!\"    And yet he had hesitated! It had remained for his own flesh and blood  to be threatened ere he had taken decisive action. The viper had lain  within his reach, and he had neglected to set his heel upon it. Men  and women had suffered and had died of its venom; and he had not  crushed it. Then Robert, his son, had felt the poison fang, and Dr.  Cairn, who had hesitated to act upon the behalf of all humanity, had  leapt to arms. He charged himself with a parent's selfishness, and his  conscience would hear no defence.    Dimly, the turmoil from the harbour reached him where he sat. He  listened dully to the hooting of a syren--that of some vessel coming  out of the canal.    His thoughts were evil company, and, with a deep sigh, he rose,  crossed the room and threw open the double windows, giving access to  the balcony.    Port Said, a panorama of twinkling lights, lay beneath him. The beam  from the lighthouse swept the town searchingly like the eye of some  pagan god lustful for sacrifice. He imagined that he could hear the  shouting of the gangs coaling the liner in the harbour; but the night  was full of the remote murmuring inseparable from that gateway of the  East. The streets below, white under the moon, looked empty and  deserted, and the hotel beneath him gave up no sound to tell of the  many birds of passage who sheltered within it. A stunning sense of his  loneliness came to him; his physical loneliness was symbolic of that  which characterised his place in the world. He, alone, had the  knowledge and the power to crush Antony Ferrara. He, alone, could rid  the world of the unnatural menace embodied in the person bearing that  name.    The town lay beneath his eyes, but now he saw nothing of it; before  his mental vision loomed--exclusively--the figure of a slim and  strangely handsome young man, having jet black hair, lustreless, a  face of uniform ivory hue, long dark eyes wherein lurked lambent  fires, and a womanish grace expressed in his whole bearing and  emphasised by his long white hands. Upon a finger of the left hand  gleamed a strange green stone.    Antony Ferrara! In the eyes of this solitary traveller, who stood  looking down upon Port Said, that figure filled the entire landscape  of Egypt!    With a weary sigh, Dr. Cairn turned and began to undress. Leaving the  windows open, he switched off the light and got into bed. He was very  weary, with a weariness rather of the spirit than of the flesh, but it  was of that sort which renders sleep all but impossible. Around and  about one fixed point his thoughts circled; in vain he endeavoured to  forget, for a while, Antony Ferrara and the things connected with him.  Sleep was imperative, if he would be in fit condition to cope with the  matters which demanded his attention in Cairo.    Yet sleep defied him. Every trifling sound from the harbour and the  canal seemed to rise upon the still air to his room. Through a sort of  mist created by the mosquito curtains, he could see the open windows,  and look out upon the stars. He found himself studying the heavens  with sleepless eyes, and idly working out the constellations visible.  Then one very bright star attracted the whole of his attention, and,  with the dogged persistency of insomnia, he sought to place it, but  could not determine to which group it belonged.    So he lay with his eyes upon the stars until the other veiled lamps of  heaven became invisible, and the patch of sky no more than a setting  for that one white orb.    In this contemplation he grew restful; his thoughts ceased feverishly  to race along that one hateful groove; the bright star seemed to  soothe him. As a result of his fixed gazing, it now appeared to have  increased in size. This was a common optical delusion, upon which he  scarcely speculated at all. He recognised the welcome approach of  sleep, and deliberately concentrated his mind upon the globe of light.    Yes, a globe of light indeed--for now it had assumed the dimensions of  a lesser moon; and it seemed to rest in the space between the open  windows. Then, he thought that it crept still nearer. The  realities--the bed, the mosquito curtain, the room--were fading, and  grateful slumber approached, and weighed upon his eyes in the form of  that dazzling globe. The feeling of contentment was the last  impression which he had, ere, with the bright star seemingly suspended  just beyond the netting, he slept.          CHAPTER XV    THE WITCH-QUEEN      A man mentally over-tired sleeps either dreamlessly, or dreams with a  vividness greater than that characterising the dreams of normal  slumber. Dr. Cairn dreamt a vivid dream.    He dreamt that he was awakened by the sound of a gentle rapping.  Opening his eyes, he peered through the cloudy netting. He started up,  and wrenched back the curtain. The rapping was repeated; and peering  again across the room, he very distinctly perceived a figure upon the  balcony by the open window. It was that of a woman who wore the black  silk dress and the white _yashmak_ of the Moslem, and who was bending  forward looking into the room.    \"Who is there?\" he called. \"What do you want?\"    \"_S--sh_!\"    The woman raised her hand to her veiled lips, and looked right and  left as if fearing to disturb the occupants of the adjacent rooms.    Dr. Cairn reached out for his dressing-gown which lay upon the chair  beside the bed, threw it over his shoulders, and stepped out upon the  floor. He stooped and put on his slippers, never taking his eyes from  the figure at the window. The room was flooded with moonlight.    He began to walk towards the balcony, when the mysterious visitor  spoke.    \"You are Dr. Cairn?\"    The words were spoken in the language of dreams; that is to say, that  although he understood them perfectly, he knew that they had not been  uttered in the English language, nor in any language known to him;  yet, as is the way with one who dreams, he had understood.    \"I am he,\" he said. \"Who are you?\"    \"Make no noise, but follow me quickly. Someone is very ill.\"    There was sincerity in the appeal, spoken in the softest, most silvern  tone which he had ever heard. He stood beside the veiled woman, and  met the glance of her dark eyes with a consciousness of some magnetic  force in the glance, which seemed to set his nerves quivering.    \"Why do you come to the window? How do you know--\"    The visitor raised her hand again to her lips. It was of a gleaming  ivory colour, and the long tapered fingers were laden with singular  jewellery--exquisite enamel work, which he knew to be Ancient  Egyptian, but which did not seem out of place in this dream adventure.    \"I was afraid to make any unnecessary disturbance,\" she replied.  \"Please do not delay, but come at once.\"    Dr. Cairn adjusted his dressing-gown, and followed the veiled  messenger along the balcony. For a dream city, Port Said appeared  remarkably substantial, as it spread out at his feet, its dingy  buildings whitened by the moonlight. But his progress was"]]]
