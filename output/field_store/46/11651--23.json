If Hervy or Fitz-Thomas lived till the year 1319, when  the Ordinances just cited received the king's sanction, he must have felt  that the struggle he had made to raise the lesser guilds had not been in  vain. The mercantile element in the city, which had formerly overcome the  aristocratic element,(287) in its turn gave way to the numerical  superiority and influence of the craft and manufacturing element. Hence it  was that in 1376--when the number of trade or craft guilds in the city  compared with the larger mercantile guilds was as forty to eight--the  guilds succeeded in wresting for a while from the wards the right of  electing members of the city's council.(288)    (M182)    In the meantime, King Edward I, arrived in London (18th August, 1274),  where he was heartily welcomed by the citizens,(289) and was crowned the  following day. He had expected to have returned much earlier, and had  addressed a letter to the mayor, sheriffs, and commonalty of the City of  London, eighteen months before, informing them of his purposed speedy  return, and of his wishes that they should endeavour to preserve the peace  of the realm.(290) He was, however, detained in France.    (M183)    Edward's right to succeed his father was never disputed. For the first  time in the annals of England, a new king commences to reign immediately  after the death of his predecessor. _Le Roi est mort, vive le_ _Roi_!  Within a week of his father's decease, a writ was issued, in which the  hereditary right of succession was distinctly asserted as forming Edward's  title to the crown.(291)    (M184)    Before setting sail for England, Edward despatched a letter (3rd April),  \"to his well-beloved, the mayor, barons, and reputable men of London,\"  thanking them for the preparations he understood they were making for the  ceremony of his coronation, and bidding them send a deputation of four of  the more discreet of the citizens, to him at Paris, for the purpose of a  special conference.(292)    (M185)    The difficulty which gave rise to this conference and to the signal mark  of distinction bestowed upon the citizens of London, proved to be of a  commercial character, and, as such, one upon which the opinions of the  leading merchants of London would be of especial value. Ever since the  year 1270, the commercial relationship between England and Flanders had  been strained. The Countess of Flanders had thought fit to lay hands upon  the wool and other merchandise belonging to English merchants found within  her dominions, and to appropriate the same to her own use. Edward's  predecessor on the throne had thereupon issued a writ to the mayor and  sheriffs of London, forbidding in future the export of wool to any parts  beyond sea whatsoever,(293) but this measure not having the desired  effect, he shortly afterwards had recourse to reprisals.    On the 28th June, 1270, a writ had been issued to the same parties  ordering them to seize the goods of all Flemings, Hainaulters, and other  subjects of the Countess, for the purpose of satisfying the claims of  English merchants; and all subjects of the Countess, except those workmen  who had received express permission to come to England for the purpose of  making cloth, and those who had taken to themselves English wives, and had  obtained a domicile in this country, were to quit the realm by a certain  date.(294) Those Flemings who neglected this injunction were to be seized  and kept in custody until further orders, and the same measures were to be  taken with those who harboured them. In the meantime, an inquisition was  ordered to be made as to the amount and value of the goods seized by the  Countess, and the English merchants were to lodge their respective claims  for compensation.    (M186)    The interruption of trade between England--at that time the chief  wool-exporting country in the world--and Flanders where the cloth-working  industry especially flourished, caused much tribulation; and the King of  France, the Duke of Brabant, and other foreign potentates, whose subjects  began to feel the effect of this commercial disturbance, addressed letters  to the King of England, requesting that their merchants might enter his  realm and stay, and traffic there as formerly. They had never offended the  King or his people; the Countess of Flanders was the sole offender, and  she alone ought to be punished. The matter having received due  consideration, the embargo on the export of wool was taken off with  respect to all countries, except Flanders, with the proviso that no wool  should be exported out of the kingdom without special license from the  king.(295)    By the month of October, 1271, the inquisitors, who had been appointed to  appraise the goods and chattels of Flemings in England, were able to  report to parliament that their value amounted to L8,000 \"together with  the king's debt,\" whilst the value of merchandise belonging to English  merchants and seized by the countess amounted to L7,000, besides chattels  of other merchants. Parliament again sat in January of the new year to  consider the claims of English merchants, when those whose goods had been  taken in Flanders, \"and the Londoners more especially,\" appeared in  person. Each stated the amount of his loss and the amount of goods  belonging to Flemings which he had in hand, and a balance was struck. An  inquisition was, at the same time, taken in each of the city wards, as to  the number of merchants who bought, sold, exchanged, or harboured the  goods of persons belonging to the dominion of the Countess; and also as to  who had taken wools out of England to the parts beyond the sea, contrary  to the king's prohibition.(296) Many Flemings, still lurking in the city,  were arrested, and only liberated on condition they abjured the realm so  long as the dispute between England and Flanders should continue. Nearly  six months elapsed before any further steps were taken by either party in  the strife. The Countess then showed signs of giving way. Envoys from her  arrived in England. She was willing to make satisfaction to all English  merchants for the losses they had sustained, but this was to be subject to  the condition that the king should bind himself to discharge certain  alleged debts, which had been the cause of all the mischief from the  outset, within a fixed time. In the event of the king failing to discharge  these claims, the justice of which he never recognised, the Countess was  to be allowed to distrain all persons coming into her country from England  by their bodies and their goods, until satisfaction should be made for  arrears. This haughty message only made matters worse. The king and his  council became indignant, and contemptuously dismissed the envoys,  commanding them to leave England within three days on peril of life and  limb.(297)    (M187)    Time went on; Henry died, and before his son Edward arrived in England  from the Holy Land to take up the reins of government, his chancellor,  Walter de Merton, had caused a proclamation to be made throughout the  city, forbidding any Fleming to enter the kingdom, under penalty of  forfeiture of person and goods. The proclamation was more than ordinarily  stringent, for it went on to say that if perchance any individual had  received special permission from the late king to sojourn and to trade  within the realm, such permission was no longer to hold good, but the  foreigner was to pack up his merchandise, collect his debts, and leave the  country by Christmas, 1273, at the latest.(298)    (M188)    The Countess had probably hoped that a change of monarch on the English  throne would have favoured her cause. This proclamation was sufficient to  show her the character of the king with whom she had in future to deal,  and destroyed any hope she may have entertained in this direction. She  therefore took the opportunity of Edward's passing through Paris to  London, to open negotiations for the purpose of restoring peace between  England and Flanders; and it was to assist the king in conducting these  negotiations, that he had summoned a deputation of citizens of London to  meet him at Paris.    (M189)    The choice of the citizens fell upon Henry le Waleys, their mayor for the  time being, one who was known almost as well in France as in the city of  London, if we may judge from the fact of his filling the office of Mayor  of Bordeaux in the following year. With him were chosen Gregory de  Rokesley who, besides being a large dealer in wool, was also a goldsmith  and financier, and as such was shortly to be appointed master of the  exchange throughout England;(299) John Horn, whose name bespeaks his  Flemish origin,(300) and who may on that account have been appointed, as  one who was intimate with both sides of the question under discussion; and  Luke de Batencurt, also of foreign extraction, who was one of the Sheriffs  of London this same year.    (M190)    These four accordingly set out to confer with the king at Paris, having  previously seen to the appointment of wardens over the city, and of  magistrates to determine complaints which might arise at the fair to be  held at St. Botolph's, or Boston, in Lincolnshire, during their  absence.(301) The deputation were absent a month. On the 19th July,  Gregory de Rokesle and certain others whose names are not mentioned again  set out in compliance with orders received from the king; the object of  their journey being, as we are expressly told, to treat of peace between  the king and the Countess of Flanders at Montreuil.(302) A month later  Edward himself was in England.

Hello, little boys and girls, how do you do this fine  winter night? I know what each of you has been thinking. You've been  wishing that _you_ could meet the Wishing Man and that he would make  _your_ wishes come true. Now, haven't you? Well, I've made that wish  come true. You wished to meet me, and here I am. I've been watching  you all the year in Sunday School. I know how you have worked over  your lessons, how you have helped your teachers and how punctual you  have been. To be sure, I know some of you haven't helped your teachers  as much as you could have done, but I'll forget all that at Christmas  time. Now tell me what you wish for most.    CHILDREN (_in audience who have previously rehearsed this scene_). A  Christmas tree. A look at old Santa Claus. Some nice Christmas  presents, etc.    WISHING MAN. Stop, stop. I can't attend to so many wishes at once.    LITTLE GIRL (_rising_). Please, Mr. Wishing Man, couldn't you tell us  what we'd better wish for?    WISHING MAN. Have you ever had a great, big Christmas tree?    CHILDREN. Oh, yes, lots of times.    WISHING MAN. Have you ever seen my old friend, Mr. Santa Claus?    CHILDREN. Oh, yes.    LITTLE BOY. We see him every year at Christmas.    WISHING MAN. How would like to go with me to Wishing Land.    CHILDREN. Oh, goody! (_Clapping hands._) That would be fine. Can you  take us there?    WISHING MAN. Of course I can. And that's just what we'll do. We'll all  of us go to the Wishing Land. First, I'll call little Dumpling.  Dumpling, little Dumpling, where are you?    BIG DUMPLING _comes in from behind the curtains._    BIG D. Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. I was playing with my little horse  and wagon. (_He plays with tiny horse and wagon._)    WISHING MAN. And how do you like being a great, big Dumpling?    BIG D. Well, not very well. I'm always bumping my head on the doors  and things. And all my toys are so very little I'm always breaking  them.    WISHING MAN. Where is your sister? Where is little Tootsy?    BIG TOOTSY _enters._    BIG T. Here, Mr. Wishing Man. I'm here. Me and my little dolly.    WISHING MAN. Well, little Tootsy, how do you like being a great, big  Tootsy?    BIG T. I don't like it very well. My clothes don't seem to fit, and I  know I look awfully funny. (_To audience._) Don't I? Everybody laughs  at me and it always makes me cry. (_Cries._)    WISHING MAN. And where is little Snookie Ookums?    BIG SNOOKUMS _enters._    BIG S. Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. Here's 'ittie Snookie Ookums.    WISHING MAN. You look like a 'ittie baby elephant, Snookie Ookums.  Well, are you children satisfied with your wish?    THE THREE. Not very much. We wish we were little again.    BIG S. (_crying_). I tried to ride my little horsie and I bweaked him  all to pieces.    BIG D. And I can't get enough to eat. My little knife and fork and  spoon are too little, and when I eat I swallow dishes and all.  (_Cries._)    BIG T. And all my clothes are too little for me, and I look so funny  that everybody laughs at me. And I don't like it at all. (_Cries._)    WISHING MAN. I'm just going to start on a journey to the Wishing Land.  The toys there are awfully big. They'd be just the right size for  you. Would you like to go with me?    BIG S. Is it very far?    BIG D. Could we get back by bedtime?    BIG T. Wouldn't it be awfully cold flying through the air?    WISHING MAN. Oh, no. We'd fly so fast you'd only have time to shiver  once and then we'd be right there.    THE THREE. Oh, yes; let's go.    WISHING MAN. All right. Now all of you part your hair right in the  middle, so you won't be heavier on one side than on the other. (_They  do so._) That's good.

SCENE: _The Wishing Land. Green or dark colored curtains at rear and  at sides. Use all the large palms and potted trees available. A  trumpet vine is attached to curtains at the rear. This is made of  branches pinned on curtain to simulate a vine. Several tin trumpets  are tied to the branches and many trumpets of various sizes made of  paper. These stick out of the vines like blossoms._    [Illustration: Fig. 1]    _At rear right is a large tree with buds made of tissue paper and toy  drums showing in the buds. See diagram. The leaves forming these buds  should be pointed oval in shape and vary in size as they represent  buds or open flowers. The drums hang down from the branches and the  petals, when open, hang open and partly cover them. Another tree  stands at rear L. This is hung with candy or bits of colored paper  simulating candy. Candy canes are on this tree and_ JIM DANDY _is  sleeping at bottom of tree._    _At R. about half-way back are branches arranged to look as if  growing, and about three feet high, hung with balls of various sizes  and colors._    _At L. about half-way back are three little girls dressed as French  dolls. They stand in a row facing the audience. At either end of the  row is a frame to support the cheesecloth curtain that hides them from  the audience. They must stand stiffly with arms held out straight in  front of them._    _At L. front are several rows of flower pots or boxes containing  growing plants with dolls fastened among the leaves. These are  branches about eighteen inches high, with green paper buds partly  enveloping the dolls._    _At R. front is a large square box (a pasteboard cracker box or  breakfast food box covered with red tissue paper will answer) in which  is_ KA-ZIN-SKI _concealed by the lid._    _At R. half-way back just in front of the ball-trees stand three  little boys dressed as toy soldiers. They stand erect and do not  move._    _Curtain rises to mysterious music played by piano. This continues  some little time until the audience \"takes in\" the scene._    _After a pause, enter the_ WISHING MAN, _followed by the three_ BIG  CHILDREN.    WISHING MAN. Well, here we are in the Wishing Land. My kingdom and not  a soul to welcome me!    BIG D. Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful place.    BIG S. See 'ittie bitsy teeny weeny trumpets gwowing in twees.    BIG T. And the dolls. The lovely, lovely dolls.    WISHING MAN (_clapping his hands_). What, ho! Is there none to welcome  me?    _Enter_ TEDDY BEAR _from L._    TEDDY BEAR (_comes to_ WISHING MAN _and bows low_).    BIG D. Oh, see the Teddy Bear.    BIG T. And he's the biggest one I ever saw.    BIG S. Nice pussy, nice, nice pussy! (_Strokes_ TEDDY BEAR.)    TEDDY BEAR (_growls_).    BIG S. (_much frightened_). Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty!    WISHING MAN. Hello, Teddy Bear. Where's your brother?    TEDDY BEAR (_shakes head as if he does not know_).    WISHING MAN. Go out and find him for me. Have you been a very, very  good Teddy Bear while I was away?    TEDDY BEAR (_nods his head_).    WISHING MAN. That's good. Now go out and find Jimmy Bear.    TEDDY BEAR (_nods head and ambles out at R._).    WISHING MAN (_looking around_). Everything is growing fine. I think  the bicycle trees need a little more water. Well, children, what do  you think of the Wishing Land?    BIG D. It's awfully pretty.    BIG T. It's perfectly gorgeous.    BIG S. Wunnerful, simply wunnerful.    WISHING MAN. Here's where I grow my toys. See, there is the trumpet  vine, and the candy tree and the dolly flowers. Whenever a little  child makes a wish for anything like that, all I have to do is to come  in here and pick a toy. See?    BIG D. Oh, lookee at the tin soldiers. They're awful big. Can I have  one, Mr. Wishing Man?    WISHING MAN. I don't think they're quite ripe yet.    BIG S. Me want a twumpet. Want a nice, big twumpet to blow.    WISHING MAN (_picks a trumpet_). There you are, my little man.    BIG T. I want one, too. A nice loud one.    WISHING MAN (_picks one_). And there's one for you, Tootsy.    BIG D. Believe I'll take a drum.    WISHING MAN (_picks a drum_). There you are. Right off the tree.    BIG D. Now we'll have a parade. (_They march around stage playing  trumpets and drums._)    WISHING MAN. Here, here, wait a minute. You're making enough noise to  wake the dead. Hold on, there. Quiet, quiet!    BIG T. Oh, dear! Just as we were having such a lovely time. "]]]
