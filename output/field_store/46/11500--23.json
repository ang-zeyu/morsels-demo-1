The soul turned inwards upon itself.    An Arab boy and donkey took out sleeping-bag, food and water to the Wadi  Hof, a desolate gorge about an hour eastwards. It winds between cliffs  whose summits rise some thousand feet above the sea. It opens suddenly,  cut deep into the swaying world of level plateaux and undulating hills.  It moves about too; he never found it in the same place twice--like an  arm of the Desert that shifted with the changing lights. Here he watched  dawns and sunsets, slept through the mid-day heat, and enjoyed the  unearthly colouring that swept Day and Night across the huge horizons.  In solitude the Desert soaked down into him. At night the jackals cried  in the darkness round his cautiously-fed camp fire--small, because wood  had to be carried--and in the day-time kites circled overhead to inspect  him, and an occasional white vulture flapped across the blue. The weird  desolation of this rocky valley, he thought, was like the scenery of the  moon. He took no watch with him, and the arrival of the donkey boy an  hour after sunrise came almost from another planet, bringing things of  time and common life out of some distant gulf where they had lain  forgotten among lost ages.    The short hour of twilight brought, too, a bewitchment into the silence  that was a little less than comfortable. Full light or darkness he could  manage, but this time of half things made him want to shut his eyes and  hide. Its effect stepped over imagination. The mind got lost. He could  not understand it. For the cliffs and boulders of discoloured limestone  shone then with an inward glow that signalled to the Desert with veiled  lanterns. The misshappen hills, carved by wind and rain into ominous  outlines, stirred and nodded. In the morning light they retired into  themselves, asleep. But at dusk the tide retreated. They rose from the  sea, emerging naked, threatening. They ran together and joined  shoulders, the entire army of them. And the glow of their sandy bodies,  self-luminous, continued even beneath the stars. Only the moonlight  drowned it. For the moonrise over the Mokattam Hills brought a white,  grand loveliness that drenched the entire Desert. It drew a marvellous  sweetness from the sand. It shone across a world as yet unfinished,  whereon no life might show itself for ages yet to come. He was alone  then upon an empty star, before the creation of things that breathed and  moved.    What impressed him, however, more than everything else was the enormous  vitality that rose out of all this apparent death. There was no hint of  the melancholy that belongs commonly to flatness; the sadness of wide,  monotonous landscape was not here. The endless repetition of sweeping  vale and plateau brought infinity within measurable comprehension. He  grasped a definite meaning in the phrase \"world without end\": the  Desert had no end and no beginning. It gave him a sense of eternal  peace, the silent peace that star-fields know. Instead of subduing the  soul with bewilderment, it inspired with courage, confidence, hope.  Through this sand which was the wreck of countless geological ages,  rushed life that was terrific and uplifting, too huge to include  melancholy, too deep to betray itself in movement. Here was the  stillness of eternity. Behind the spread grey masque of apparent death  lay stores of accumulated life, ready to break forth at any point. In  the Desert he felt himself absolutely royal.    And this contrast of Life, veiling itself in Death, was a contradiction  that somehow intoxicated. The Desert exhilaration never left him. He was  never alone. A companionship of millions went with him, and he _felt_  the Desert close, as stars are close to one another, or grains of sand.    It was the Khamasin, the hot wind bringing sand, that drove him in--with  the feeling that these few days and nights had been immeasurable, and  that he had been away a thousand years. He came back with the magic of  the Desert in his blood, hotel-life tasteless and insipid by comparison.  To human impressions thus he was fresh and vividly sensitive. His being,  cleaned and sensitized by pure grandeur, \"felt\" people--for a time at  any rate--with an uncommon sharpness of receptive judgment. He returned  to a life somehow mean and meagre, resuming insignificance with his  dinner jacket. Out with the sand he had been regal; now, like a slave,  he strutted self-conscious and reduced.    But this imperial standard of the Desert stayed a little time beside  him, its purity focussing judgment like a lens. The specks of smaller  emotions left it clear at first, and as his eye wandered vaguely over  the people assembled in the dining-room, it was arrested with a vivid  shock upon two figures at the little table facing him.    He had forgotten Vance, the Birmingham man who sought the North at  midnight with a pocket compass. He now saw him again, with an intuitive  discernment entirely fresh. Before memory brought up her clouding  associations, some brilliance flashed a light upon him. \"That man,\"  Henriot thought, \"might have come with me. He would have understood and  loved it!\" But the thought was really this--a moment's reflection spread  it, rather: \"He belongs somewhere to the Desert; the Desert brought him  out here.\" And, again, hidden swiftly behind it like a movement running  below water--\"What does he want with it? What is the deeper motive he  conceals? For there is a deeper motive; and it _is_ concealed.\"    But it was the woman seated next him who absorbed his attention really,  even while this thought flashed and went its way. The empty chair was  occupied at last. Unlike his first encounter with the man, she looked  straight at him. Their eyes met fully. For several seconds there was  steady mutual inspection, while her penetrating stare, intent without  being rude, passed searchingly all over his face. It was disconcerting.  Crumbling his bread, he looked equally hard at her, unable to turn away,  determined not to be the first to shift his gaze. And when at length she  lowered her eyes he felt that many things had happened, as in a long  period of intimate conversation. Her mind had judged him through and  through. Questions and answer flashed. They were no longer strangers.  For the rest of dinner, though he was careful to avoid direct  inspection, he was aware that she felt his presence and was secretly  speaking with him. She asked questions beneath her breath. The answers  rose with the quickened pulses in his blood. Moreover, she explained  Richard Vance. It was this woman's power that shone reflected in the  man. She was the one who knew the big, unusual things. Vance merely  echoed the rush of her vital personality.    This was the first impression that he got--from the most striking,  curious face he had ever seen in a woman. It remained very near him all  through the meal: she had moved to his table, it seemed she sat beside  him. Their minds certainly knew contact from that moment.    It is never difficult to credit strangers with the qualities and  knowledge that oneself craves for, and no doubt Henriot's active fancy  went busily to work. But, none the less, this thing remained and grew:  that this woman was aware of the hidden things of Egypt he had always  longed to know. There was knowledge and guidance she could impart. Her  soul was searching among ancient things. Her face brought the Desert  back into his thoughts. And with it came--the sand.    Here was the flash. The sight of her restored the peace and splendour he  had left behind him in his Desert camps. The rest, of course, was what  his imagination constructed upon this slender basis. Only,--not all of  it was imagination.    Now, Henriot knew little enough of women, and had no pose of  \"understanding\" them. His experience was of the slightest; the love and  veneration felt for his own mother had set the entire sex upon the  heights. His affairs with women, if so they may be called, had been  transient--all but those of early youth, which having never known the  devastating test of fulfilment, still remained ideal and superb. There  was unconscious humour in his attitude--from a distance; for he regarded  women with wonder and respect, as puzzles that sweetened but complicated  life, might even endanger it. He certainly was not a marrying man! But  now, as he felt the presence of this woman so deliberately possess him,  there came over him two clear, strong messages, each vivid with  certainty. One was that banal suggestion of familiarity claimed by  lovers and the like--he had often heard of it--\"I have known that woman  before; I have met her ages ago somewhere; she is strangely familiar to  me\"; and the other, growing out of it almost: \"Have nothing to do with  her; she will bring you trouble and confusion; avoid her, and be  warned\";--in fact, a distinct presentiment.    Yet, although Henriot dismissed both impressions as having no shred of  evidence to justify them, the original clear judgment, as he studied her  extraordinary countenance, persisted through all denials The  familiarity, and the presentiment, remained. There also remained this  other--an enormous imaginative leap!--that she could teach him \"Egypt.\"    He watched her carefully, in a sense fascinated. He could only describe  the face as black, so dark it was with the darkness of great age.  Elderly was the obvious, natural word; but elderly described the  features only. The expression of the face wore centuries. Nor was it  merely the coal-black eyes that betrayed an ancient, age-travelled soul  behind them. The entire presentment mysteriously conveyed it. This  woman's heart knew long-forgotten things--the thought kept beating up  against him. There were cheek-bones, oddly high, that made him think  involuntarily of the well-advertised Pharaoh, Ramases; a square,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#18)"],[1,"with water; in working  metals; in many mechanical arts; and in navigation. By the aid of  steam, vessels are propelled with greater swiftness than those which  are wholly dependent on the winds and tides; and thus trade is  facilitated, and we are enabled to communicate with distant lands in a  much shorter space of time than was formerly consumed. On land,  railroads are constructed, on which steam carriages run with  astonishing rapidity, so that a journey which by coach and horses  formerly required two or more days, may now be performed in four or  five hours.         _Mechanical_, belonging to Mechanics.      To whom are we indebted for its invention?    Its invention is by most writers ascribed to the Marquis of Worcester,  an Englishman, about 1663; but it does not appear that the inventor  could ever interest the public in favor of this, or his other  discoveries. The steam engine of Captain Savery, also an Englishman,  is the first of which any definite description has been preserved. It  was invented in 1698. Since that period it has been successively  improved by various persons, but it is to Mr. Watt and Mr. Boulton, of  England, that it is indebted for much of its present state of  perfection.      By whom was the Steam Engine first applied to the purposes of  Navigation?    By John Fitch, of Pennsylvania. From papers in the historical  collections of Pennsylvania, it appears that the first successful  experiments were made at Philadelphia, in 1785, three years before the  attempts at Falkirk, and on the Clyde, in Scotland. The boat made  several trips on the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, but owing to  repeated accidents to her machinery, and the want of funds and  competent mechanics for the necessary repairs, she was abandoned. In  1807, Robert Fulton, also of Pennsylvania, made his first experimental  trip on the Hudson River, with complete success. To this distinguished  and ingenious American justly belongs the honor of having brought  navigation by steam to a state of perfection. In 1819, the first  steamship crossed the Atlantic from Savannah to Liverpool; and in  1838, a regular communication by steamship was established between  Great Britain and the United States. Since that period, ocean  navigation by steam-vessels has made rapid progress, and, at the  present time, numbers of steamers connect our various seaports with  those of other nations, and with each other.      What is the Electro-Magnetic Telegraph?    An instrument, or apparatus, by means of which intelligence is  conveyed to any distance with the velocity of lightning. The electric  fluid, when an excess has accumulated in one place, always seeks to  transfer itself to another, until an equilibrium of its distribution  is fully restored. Consequently, when two places are connected by  means of a good conductor of electricity, as, for instance, the  telegraphic wire; the fluid generated by a galvanic battery, if the  communication be rendered complete, instantaneously traverses the  whole extent of the wire, and charges, at the distant station, an  electro-magnet; this attracts one end of a lever, and draws it  downward, while the other extremity is thrown up, and, by means of a  style, marks a slip of paper, which is steadily wound off from a  roller by the aid of clock-work. If the communication is immediately  broken, only one wave of electricity passes over, and a _dot_ is made  upon the paper; if kept up, a _line_ is marked. These dots and lines  are made to represent the letters of the alphabet, so that an operator  employed for the purpose can easily read the message which is  transmitted.--The Electro-Magnetic Telegraph was first introduced upon  a line between Baltimore and Washington, by Professor Morse, in 1844;  at the present time, it is in successful operation between nearly all  the important cities and towns of the United States and of Europe.         An _Electro-Magnet_ is a piece of soft iron, rendered       temporarily magnetic by being placed within a coil of wire       through which a current of electricity is passing.          CHAPTER XIII.    SOAP, CANDLES, TALLOW TREE, SPERMACETI, WAX, MAHOGANY, INDIAN  RUBBER OR CAOUTCHOUC, SPONGE, CORAL, LIME, CARBON, OXYGEN, NITROGEN,  GAS, HYDROGEN, CHALK, AND MARBLE.      Of what is Soap composed?    Of soda or potash, and various oily substances; it is so useful for  domestic and other purposes, that it may be regarded as one of the  necessaries of life; immense quantities of it are consumed in all  civilized countries. Soft soap is generally made of a lye of  wood-ashes and quicklime, boiled up with tallow or oil; common  household soap of soda and tallow, or of potash and tallow; when  potash is used, a large portion of common salt, which contains soda,  is added to harden it. The finest white soaps are made of olive oil  and a lye consisting of soda and quicklime; perfumes are sometimes  added, or various coloring matters stirred in to give the soap a  variegated appearance. The ancient Greeks and Hebrews appear to have  been acquainted with the art of making soap, or a composition very  similar to it; and also the ancient Gauls and Germans. A soap-boiler's  shop, with soap in it, was found in the city of Pompeii, in Italy,  which was overwhelmed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius, A.D. 79.      What is Soda?    Soda, or barilla, is obtained from the ashes of marine plants, and by  the decomposition of common salt; its great depository is the ocean,  soda being the basis of salt. The marine plants from which the soda is  obtained, are endowed with the property of decomposing the sea-salt  which they imbibe, and of absorbing the soda which it contains. It is  found native in Egypt, and is there called _natron_; a name similar to  that which it bore among the Jews and Greeks.         _Depository_, store-house, place where anything is lodged.         _Imbibe_, to drink in, to absorb.      Of what are Candles made?    Of Tallow, which means animal fat melted and clarified, that is,  cleansed or purified from filth. Tallow is procured from many animals,  but the most esteemed, and the most used, is that made from oxen,  sheep, swine, goats, deer, bears, &c.; some of which tallows or fats  are used in medicine, some in making soap, and dressing leather;  others in the manufacture of candles, &c. For the last-mentioned  article, that of sheep and oxen is most used; candles of a better sort  are likewise made of wax and spermaceti. Candles are kept burning by  means of a wick of cotton or rush, placed in the centre of the tallow,  which is moulded into a cylindrical form.         _Cylindrical_, having the form of a cylinder.      Is there not a tree which yields a vegetable Tallow?    Yes; China possesses a tree producing a substance like our tallow, of  which the Chinese make their candles; this tallow is extracted from  the stone of the fruit, the tallow being a white pulp which surrounds  it. In America, likewise, there is a shrub, a native of the temperate  parts, especially towards the sea-side, the seeds of which contain a  waxy substance used for the same purpose, and which is extracted by  boiling; this shrub is a species of myrtle, and does not attain to any  great size.         _Extracted_, drawn from.      What is Spermaceti?    A whitish, flaky, unctuous substance, prepared from an oil of the same  name, drawn from a particular kind of whale, distinguished from the  common whale by having teeth, and a hunch on its back.         _Flaky_, having the nature of flakes.      What is Wax?    A soft, yellow, concrete matter, collected from vegetables by the  bee, of which this industrious and useful insect constructs its cell.  Wax forms a considerable article of trade; it is of two kinds, the  yellow and the white; the yellow is the native wax as it is taken from  the hive, and the white is the same washed, purified, and exposed to  the air.         _Concrete_, grown together, solid.      What Tree produces the beautiful and well-known wood so much used in  making the various articles of household furniture?    The Mahogany Tree, growing in America, and the East and West Indies;  it frequently grows in the crevices of rocks, and other places of the  same description. This wood was not used for making furniture till  near the end of the seventeenth century. A London physician had a  brother, the captain of a West India ship, who, on his return to  England, having on board several logs of mahogany for the purpose of  ballast, made him a present of the wood, he being engaged in a  building project; his carpenter, however, threw it aside, observing  that it was too hard to be wrought. Some time after, the lady of the  physician being in want of a box to hold candles, the cabinet-maker  was directed to make it of this wood; he also made the same objection,  and declared that it spoiled his tools. Being urged, however, to make  another trial, he at length succeeded; when the box was polished, the  beautiful color of the wood was so novel, that it became an object of  great curiosity. Before this time, mahogany had been used partially in  the West Indies for ship-building, but this new discovery of its  beauty soon brought it into general use for making furniture.         _Crevice_, a rent, a crack.         _Ballast_, the heavy matter placed in the hold of a vessel       to keep it steady.      What is India Rubber or Caoutchouc?    An elastic, resinous substance, produced from a tree, growing  abundantly at Cayenne, Quito, and other parts of South America; and  also in some parts of the Indies. The tree which produces it is  large, straight, and about sixty feet high. There is, however, a small  species found in Sumatra and Java, and some of the neighboring  islands.      How is the Caoutchouc obtained from the Tree?    By making incisions in the trunk of the tree, from which the fluid  resin issues in great abundance, appearing of a milky whiteness at"]]]
