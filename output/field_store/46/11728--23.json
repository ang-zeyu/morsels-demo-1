You are in the right, dear Phillips; I don't expect regular answers  to every letter--I know a college-life is too circumscribed to afford  materials for such quick returns of communication. For my part, I am  continually shifting the scene, and surrounded with new objects; some  of which are striking enough. I shall therefore conclude my journal for  your amusement; and, though, in all appearance, it will not treat of  very important or interesting particulars, it may prove, perhaps, not  altogether uninstructive and unentertaining.    The music and entertainments of Bath are over for this season; and  all our gay birds of passage have taken their flight to Bristolwell,  Tunbridge, Brighthelmstone, Scarborough, Harrowgate, &c. Not a soul is  seen in this place, but a few broken-winded parsons, waddling like so  many crows along the North Parade. There is always a great shew of  the clergy at Bath: none of your thin, puny, yellow, hectic figures,  exhausted with abstinence, and hardy study, labouring under the morbi  eruditorum, but great overgrown dignitaries and rectors, with rubicund  noses and gouty ancles, or broad bloated faces, dragging along great  swag bellies; the emblems of sloth and indigestion.    Now we are upon the subject of parsons, I must tell you a ludicrous  adventure, which was achieved the other day by Tom Eastgate, whom you  may remember on the foundation of Queen's. He had been very assiduous  to pin himself upon George Prankley, who was a gentleman-commoner of  Christchurch, knowing the said Prankley was heir to a considerable  estate, and would have the advowson of a good living, the incumbent of  which was very old and infirm. He studied his passions, and flattered  them so effectually, as to become his companion and counsellor; and,  at last, obtained of him a promise of the presentation, when the living  should fall. Prankley, on his uncle's death, quitted Oxford, and made  his first appearance in the fashionable world at London; from whence  he came lately to Bath, where he has been exhibiting himself among the  bucks and gamesters of the place. Eastgate followed him hither; but he  should not have quitted him for a moment, at his first emerging into  life. He ought to have known he was a fantastic, foolish, fickle  fellow, who would forget his college-attachments the moment they ceased  appealing to his senses. Tom met with a cold reception from his old  friend; and was, moreover, informed, that he had promised the living to  another man, who had a vote in the county, where he proposed to offer  himself a candidate at the next general election. He now remembered  nothing of Eastgate, but the freedoms he had used to take with him,  while Tom had quietly stood his butt, with an eye to the benefice; and  those freedoms he began to repeat in common-place sarcasms on his person  and his cloth, which he uttered in the public coffeehouse, for the  entertainment of the company. But he was egregiously mistaken in  giving his own wit credit for that tameness of Eastgate, which had been  entirely owing to prudential considerations. These being now removed,  he retorted his repartee with interest, and found no great difficulty in  turning the laugh upon the aggressor; who, losing his temper, called him  names, and asked, If he knew whom he talked to? After much altercation,  Prankley, shaking his cane, bid him hold his tongue, otherwise he could  dust his cassock for him. 'I have no pretensions to such a valet (said  Tom) but if you should do me that office, and overheat yourself, I have  here a good oaken towel at your service.'    Prankley was equally incensed and confounded at this reply. After a  moment's pause, he took him aside towards die window; and, pointing to  the clump of firs, on Clerken-down, asked in a whisper, if he had  spirit enough to meet him there, with a case of pistols, at six o'clock  tomorrow morning. Eastgate answered in the affirmative; and, with a  steady countenance, assured him, he would not fail to give him the  rendezvous at the hour he mentioned. So saying, he retired; and the  challenger stayed some time in manifest agitation. In the morning,  Eastgate, who knew his man, and had taken his resolution, went to  Prankley's lodgings, and roused him by five o'clock.    The squire, in all probability, cursed his punctuality in his heart, but  he affected to talk big; and having prepared his artillery overnight,  they crossed the water at the end of the South Parade. In their progress  up the hill, Prankley often eyed the parson, in hopes of perceiving  some reluctance in his countenance; but as no such marks appeared, he  attempted to intimidate him by word of mouth. 'If these flints do their  office (said he) I'll do thy business in a few minutes.' 'I desire you  will do your best (replied the other); for my part, I come not here to  trifle. Our lives are in the hands of God; and one of us already totters  on the brink of eternity' This remark seemed to make some impression  upon the squire, who changed countenance, and with a faultering accent  observed, 'That it ill became a clergyman to be concerned in quarrels  and bloodshed'--'Your insolence to me (said Eastgate) I should have bore  with patience, had not you cast the most infamous reflections upon my  order, the honour of which I think myself in duty bound to maintain,  even at the expence of my heart's blood; and surely it can be no crime  to put out of the world a profligate wretch, without any sense of  principle, morality, or religion'--'Thou may'st take away my life (cried  Prankley, in great perturbation) but don't go to murder my character.  What! has't got no conscience?' 'My conscience is perfectly quiet  (replied the other); and now, Sir, we are upon the spot--Take your  ground as near as you please; prime your pistol; and the Lord, of his  infinite mercy, have compassion upon your miserable soul!'    This ejaculation he pronounced in a loud solemn tone, with his hat off,  and his eyes lifted up; then drawing a large horse-pistol, he presented,  and put himself in a posture of action. Prankley took his distance, and  endeavoured to prime, but his hand shook with such violence, that he  found this operation impracticable--His antagonist, seeing how it was  with him, offered his assistance, and advanced for that purpose; when  the poor squire, exceedingly alarmed at what he had heard and seen,  desired the action might be deferred till next day, as he had not  settled his affairs. 'I ha'n't made my will (said he); my sisters are  not provided for; and I just now recollect an old promise, which my  conscience tells me I ought to perform--I'll first convince thee,  that I'm not a wretch without principle, and then thou shalt have an  opportunity to take my life, which thou seem'st to thirst after so  eagerly.'    Eastgate understood the hint; and told him, that one day should break no  squares: adding, 'God forbid that I should be the means of hindering you  from acting the part of an honest man, and a dutiful brother'--By virtue  of this cessation, they returned peaceably together. Prankley forthwith  made out the presentation of the living, and delivered it to Eastgate,  telling him at the same time, he had now settled his affairs, and was  ready to attend him to the Fir-grove; but Tom declared he could not  think of lifting his hand against the life of so great a benefactor--He  did more: when they next met at the coffeehouse, he asked pardon of Mr  Prankley, if in his passion he had said any thing to give him offence;  and the squire was so gracious as to forgive him with a cordial shake of  the hand, declaring, that he did not like to be at variance with an old  college companion--Next day, however, he left Bath abruptly; and then  Eastgate told me all these particulars, not a little pleased with the  effects of his own sagacity, by which he has secured a living worth  160l. per annum.    Of my uncle, I have nothing at present to say; but that we set out  tomorrow for London en famille. He and the ladies, with the maid and  Chowder in a coach; I and the man-servant a-horseback. The particulars  of our journey you shall have in my next, provided no accident happens  to prevent,    Yours ever, J. MELFORD BATH May 17.          To Dr LEWIS.    DEAR DICK,    I shall to-morrow set out for London, where I have bespoke lodgings, at  Mrs Norton's in Golden-square. Although I am no admirer of Bath, I shall  leave it with regret; because I must part with some old friends,  whom, in all probability, I shall never see again. In the course of  coffeehouse conversation, I had often heard very extraordinary encomiums  passed on the performances of Mr T--, a gentleman residing in this  place, who paints landscapes for his amusement. As I have no great  confidence in the taste and judgment of coffeehouse connoisseurs, and  never received much pleasure from this branch of the art, those general  praises made no impression at all on my curiosity; but, at the request  of a particular friend, I went yesterday to see the pieces, which had  been so warmly commended--I must own I am no judge of painting, though  very fond of pictures. I don't imagine that my senses would play me so  false, as to betray me into admiration of any thing that was very bad;  but, true it is, I have often overlooked capital beauties, in pieces of  extraordinary merit.--If I am not totally devoid of taste, however, this  young gentleman of Bath is the best landscape-painter now living: I was  struck with his performances in such a manner, as I had never been  by painting before. His trees not only have a richness of foliage  and warmth of colouring, which delights the view; but also a certain  magnificence in the disposition and spirit in the expression, which  I cannot describe.

The Romans ceased from the attack and crowded  round their general but, as soon as they ascertained that his wound  was not serious, they returned to the attack with redoubled fury.    All that night, the contest raged unceasingly. The Roman engines  swept the walls with missiles. The towers came crashing down, under  the blows of the huge stones; while the javelins, arrows, and the  stones from the slings created terrible havoc among the defenders  of the wall. But, as fast as these fell, fresh combatants took  their places; and they continued hurling down stones, and blazing  brands, upon the freshly-erected wattles round the battering ram.  The Romans had the advantage in this strife for, while the fires on  the walls--at which the Jews lighted their brands, and boiled the  pitch and sulphur in which these were dipped--enabled them to aim  accurately, they themselves worked in deep shadow, at the foot of  the wall.    The night was a terrible one. The bolts, stones, and arrows which  passed over the wall spread ruin and death over the town. The din  was unceasing. The thundering noise of the great stones; the dull,  deep sound as the ram struck the wall; the fierce shouts of the  combatants, as they fought hand to hand--for the corpses were, in  places, piled so thick that the assailants could mount upon them to  the top of the walls--the shrieks of the women, and the screams of  the children, combined in one terrible and confused noise; which  was echoed back, and multiplied, by the surrounding mountains.    Morning was just breaking when the shaken wall gave way, and fell,  with a crash. Vespasian called off his weary troops, and allowed  them a short time for refreshment; then he prepared to storm the  breach. He brought up, first, a number of his bravest horsemen;  dismounted, and clad in complete armor. They were provided with long  pikes, and were to charge forward, the instant the machines for  mounting the breach were fixed. Behind these were the best of his  infantry, while in their rear were the archers and slingers. Other  parties, with scaling ladders, were to attack the uninjured part of  the wall, and to draw off the attention of the besiegers. The rest  of the horse extended all over the hills round the town, so that  none might make their escape.    Josephus prepared to receive the attack. He placed the old, infirm,  and wounded to repel the attack on the uninjured parts of the wall.  He then chose the five strongest and bravest men and, with them,  took his place to form the front line of the defenders of the  breach. He told them to kneel down and cover their heads with their  bucklers, until the enemy's archers had emptied their quivers and,  when the Romans had fixed the machines for mounting, they were to  leap down among the enemy and fight to the last; remembering that  there was now no hope of safety, naught but to revenge the fate  which was impending over them, their wives and children.    As the Romans mounted to the assault, a terrible cry broke out from  the women. They saw the Romans still manning the lines which cut  off all escape, and they believed that the end was now at hand.  Josephus, fearing that their cries would dispirit the men, ordered  them all to be locked up in their houses, and then calmly awaited  the assault.    The trumpet of the legion sounded, and the whole Roman host set up  a terrible shout while, at the same moment, the air was darkened by  the arrows of their bowmen. Kneeling beneath their bucklers, the  Jews remained calm and immovable; and then, before the Romans had  time to set foot upon the breach, with a yell of fury they rushed  upon them, and threw themselves into the midst of their assailants.  For a time, the Romans could make no way against the desperate  courage of the Jews but, as fast as the leading files fell, fresh  troops took their places; while the Jews, who were vastly reduced  by their losses, had no fresh men to take the place of those who  died.    At last, the solid phalanx of the Romans drove back the defenders,  and entered the breach. But as they did so, from the walls above  and from the breach in front, vessels filled with boiling oil were  hurled down upon them. The Roman ranks were broken; and the men, in  agony, rolled on the ground, unable to escape the burning fluid  which penetrated through the joints of their armor. Those who turned  to fly were pierced by the javelins of the Jews; for the Romans  carried no defensive armor on their backs, which were never  supposed to be turned towards an enemy.    Fresh troops poured up the breach, to take the place of their  agonized comrades; but the Jews threw down, upon the planks,  vessels filled with a sort of vegetable slime. Unable to retain  their footing upon the slippery surface, the Romans fell upon each  other, in heaps. Those rolling down carried others with them, and a  terrible confusion ensued, the Jews never ceasing to pour their  missiles upon them.    When evening came, Vespasian called off his men. He saw that, to  overcome the desperate resistance of the defenders, fresh steps  must be taken before the assault was repeated; and he accordingly  gave orders that the embankment should be raised, much higher than  before; and that upon it three towers, each fifty feet high and  strongly girded with iron, should be built.    This great work was carried out, in spite of the efforts of the  besieged. In the towers, Vespasian placed his javelin men, archers,  and light machines and, as these now looked down upon the wall,  they were enabled to keep up such a fire upon it that the Jews  could no longer maintain their footing; but contented themselves  with lying behind it, and making desperate sallies whenever they  saw any parties of Romans approaching the breach.    In the meantime, a terrible calamity had befallen the neighboring  town of Japha. Emboldened by the vigorous defense of Jotapata, it  had closed its gates to the Romans. Vespasian sent Trajan, with two  thousand foot and a thousand horse, against it.    The city was strongly situated, and surrounded by a double wall.  Instead of waiting to be attacked, the people sallied out and fell  upon the Romans. They were, however, beaten back; and the Romans,  pressing on their heels, entered with them through the gates of the  outside walls. The defenders of the gates through the inner walls,  fearing that these, too, would be carried by the mob, closed them;  and all those who had sallied out were butchered by the Romans.    Trajan, seeing that the garrison must now be weak, sent to  Vespasian, and asked him to send his son to complete the victory.  Titus soon arrived, with a thousand foot and five hundred horse  and, at once, assaulted the inner walls. The defense was feeble.  The Romans effected their entry but, inside the town, a desperate  conflict took place; the inhabitants defending every street, with  the energy of despair, while the women aided their efforts by  hurling down stones, and missiles, from the roofs. The battle  lasted six hours, when all who could bear arms were slain. The rest  of the male population were put to death, the women taken as  slaves. In all, fifteen thousand were killed, two thousand one  hundred and thirty taken prisoners.    In another direction, a heavy blow had also been struck by the  Romans. The Samaritans had not openly joined the revolt, but had  gathered in great force on Mount Gerizim. Cerealis was sent by  Vespasian, with three thousand infantry and six hundred horse,  against them. He surrounded the foot of the mountain, and abstained  from an assault until the Samaritans were weakened by thirst--many  dying from want of water. Cerealis then mounted the hill, and sent  to them to throw down their arms. On their refusal, he charged them  from all sides, and put every soul--in number, eleven thousand six  hundred--to the sword.    The situation of the defenders of Jotapata was now pitiable,  indeed. Scarce a man but had received wounds, more or less severe,  in the desperate combats. All were utterly worn out with fatigue;  for they were under arms, day and night, in readiness to repel the  expected attack. Numbers of the women and children had died of  thirst, and terror. Save the armed men lying in groups near the  foot of the wall, in readiness to repel an assault, scarce a soul  was to be seen in the lately-crowded streets.    The houses were now ample to contain the vastly diminished number.  Here the women and children crouched, in utter prostration. The  power of suffering was almost gone. Few cared how soon the end  came.    The siege had now continued for forty-seven days; and the Roman  army, strong in numbers, in discipline, and in arms, and commanded  by one of its best generals, had yet failed to capture the little  town--which they had expected to take within a few hours of their  appearance before it--and so fierce was the valor of the besieged,  that Vespasian did not venture to order his legions forward to  renew the assault. But now, a deserter informed him that the  garrison was greatly exhausted, that the men on guard could not  keep awake; and that the breach could be carried, at night, by a  sudden assault.    Vespasian prepared for the assault, which was to take place at  daybreak. A thick mist enveloped the town, and the sleeping  sentries were not aroused by the silent steps of the approaching  Romans. Titus was the first to enter the breach, followed by a  small number of troops. These killed the sleeping guards, and the  main body of the Romans then poured in. Before the Jews were  conscious of their danger, the whole of the Roman army was upon  them.    Then the slaughter commenced. Many of the Jews killed each other,  rather than fall into the hands of the Romans. Many threw  themselves over the precipices, numbers took refuge in the deep  caverns under the city. That day, all in the streets or houses were  killed; the "]]]
