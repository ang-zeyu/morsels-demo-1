[Illustration]          [Illustration]    ROBERT THE SECOND.      After slight intimacies with various robins who were visitors to the  conservatory and found their way in and out at the open windows, I was  led to special friendship with a brown-coated young bird I used often to  see close to the open French window where I was sitting. He was coaxed  into the room by mealworms being thrown to him until he made himself  quite at home indoors. By the time he had attained his red breast the  weather had become too cold for open windows, but Bobbie would sit on  the ledge and wait till I let him in, and then he would be my happy  little companion for the whole morning, flitting all about the room,  along the corridor, into the hall--in fact, he was to be found all over  the house; but when hungry he returned to me as his best friend, because  I was the provider of his delightsome mealworms. It was always amusing  to visitors to see me feed my small fowl! He would be on the alert to  see where his prey was to be found, and he would hunt for it  perseveringly if it happened to fall out of sight. He was often to be  seen perched on the Californian mouse's cage, and I wondered what could  be the attraction; at last I discovered that he coveted mousie's brown  biscuits, and after that he was allowed one for his own use, kept in a  special corner, where a cup of water was also provided for his small  requirements.    However tame wild birds may seem there will be times when all at once a  sort of intense longing to get out seems to possess them. When this was  the case Bobbie would fly backwards and forwards uttering his plaintive  cry (one of the six kinds of notes by which robins express their  feelings), and his distress was so evident that the window was always  opened at once to let him go out.    I am sorry to have to confess that robins are most vindictive towards  each other! Bobbie maintained a very angry warfare with a hated rival  out-of-doors, in fact his chief occupation in life seemed to be watching  for his enemy. He might often be seen sitting under a small palm in a  pot on the window-ledge, and whilst looking the picture of gentle  innocence he was, I fear, cherishing envy, hatred, and malice in his  naughty little heart, for, all at once, there would be a grand  fluttering and pecking at the window whilst the two little furies, one  inside and the other out, expended their strength in harmless warfare  which only ceased when they were too exhausted to do more, and then  followed on both sides a triumphant song of defiance or victory.    I must now weave into this biography the life-history of a poor robin  which, I suppose, must have been caught in a trap, for it had lost the  lower mandible of its beak, and had only a little knob remaining of the  upper mandible. It haunted the windows, and looked so hungry and  miserable from its inability to pick up its food, that I thought it  kindest to coax it into a cage where it could be fed with suitable food.  By placing mealworms in a cage I at last induced it to hop in, and for  five months it had a very happy life indoors, feeding on soaked brown  bread and all the insect diet I could secure for it. When the cage was  cleaned each morning Bobbie was let out, and would take a bath in a  glass dish, and then fly to the top of the looking-glass, where he would  often remain all day unless we were quick enough to secure his cage-door  when he went in to feed. By the middle of May I thought caterpillars  would be plentiful enough for him to find his own living, so one day he  was released, but unhappily Robert the Second was close by, and the  moment he saw the invalid in his cage on the lawn with the door open, he  rushed in and savagely fought the poor defenceless bird. Before we could  interfere he drove our pet out of his cage, and terrible was the battle  that went on; the beakless bird was driven far away, and I was quite  unhappy about his fate, for he was now beyond my loving care, and I  never expected to see him again. Two months passed by, and I only once  caught a glimpse of the invalid, but at last he came just as before to  the window, looking thin and ill, with ruffled feathers, and evidently  again at starvation point. Once more he entered his cage and began his  old life, only now he was hung under the veranda so as to enjoy fresh  air and the songs of his companions. For two months I endeavoured to  keep the dear little creature happy; we were all so fond of him, and it  seems very touching to think that in his times of extremity he should  have come willingly into captivity and felt sure that a kind welcome  would be accorded him. But no amount of care could bring him through the  moulting season, the lack of a beak to plume his feathers and his great  difficulty in picking up even the mealworms made him weak and sickly. He  got out of his cage one day into the garden, and a few days after we  found his poor little body lying dead close to the window where he had  always found the help he needed, and yet we could not but be glad that  his sorrowful little life was ended.    When robins have been thus tamed for years the families they rear are  like pet birds; they are fed by their parents close to the windows, and  then come indoors, as if they knew they would be welcome everywhere.    There is one feature in the robin's character that, as far as I know, is  shared by no other bird; I mean his adopting a certain spot as his  district and always keeping to it, just as the stickle-backs portion out  a pond and jealously defend the territory they have chosen. Here, there  is a special robin to be found at each of the lodges; one haunts the  Mission Hall and will often sing vigorously from the reading-stand while  classes are going on. A very tame one lives in the coachman's house,  running about the floor like a little brown mouse, and sitting inside  the fender on cold days to warm himself. He must have met with trouble  in his early youth, for when first seen he was very lame, and had lost  the sight of one eye. Through kind care he has become well and strong,  but he is much at the mercy of his enemies, who often attack him on his  blind side. The conservatory, dining-room, and drawing-rooms have each  their little redbreast visitor; the latter is so tame he will take  meal-worms from my hand, and sits on my inkstand singing a sweet, low  song whilst I write. As long as each bird keeps to his domain there is  peace, but woe to any intruder! The conflicts are desperate, and I have  often to mediate, and separate two little furies rolling over and over  on the ground. I suppose it is in this way that the idea has arisen  about the young robins killing the old ones; I cannot ascertain that it  has any foundation--in fact, every robin fights his neighbour all the  year through, except when paired and busy with domestic duties. As dead  redbreasts are not found specially in autumn, I do not think there can  be any truth in the superstition.          [Illustration]    FEEDING BIRDS IN SUMMER AND WINTER.      On wintry mornings, when leaf and twig are decked with hoar-frost and  the ground is hard and dry, affording no food for the birds, it is a  piteous sight to see them cowering under the evergreens with ruffled  feathers, evidently starving and miserable, quietly waiting for the  death that must overtake many of them unless we come to their rescue.    It is one of my delights to feed the small \"feathered fowls\" through all  the winter months, and I only wish all my readers could enjoy with me  the lovely scenes of happy bird life to be witnessed through the French  window opposite my writing-table. These gatherings of birds are the  result of many years of persistent kindness and thought for the welfare  of my bird pets. Their tameness cannot be attained all at once; it takes  time to establish confidence; it needs thought about the kinds of food  required by various species of birds, regularity in feeding, and quiet  gentleness of manner to avoid frightening any new and timid visitors.  Doubtless there are very many lovers of birds who share this pleasure  with me, but for those who may not happen to know how to attract the  feathered tribes I will go a little into detail.    This being a large garden near game preserves, and surrounded by a wide,  furze-covered common, I have been able to attract and tame the ordinary  wild pheasants by putting out Indian corn, buckwheat, and raisins, till  now they come to the doorstep and look up with their brilliant,  red-ringed eyes, and feed calmly whilst I watch them. It is a really  beautiful sight to see three or four cock birds, with their  golden-bronze plumage glistening like polished metal as the morning sun  rests upon them, and as many of their more sober-coloured mates  feasting on the dainties they find prepared for them; as a rule, they  are very amicable and feed together like barndoor fowls. When satisfied,  the brown hens run swiftly away to cover, while the cocks, with greater  confidence, walk quietly away in stately fashion, or remain under the  trees.    Wood-pigeons are usually very shy and wary birds, yet these also come,  six and eight at a time, and feed at my window, Indian corn and peas  being their specialities. I have large quantities of beech-nuts and  acorns collected every autumn, and thus I can scatter this food also for  pigeons and squirrels all through the winter. Jays, jackdaws, rooks, and  magpies also approve of acorns and beech-nuts, so it is doing a real  kindness to tribes of birds to reserve this food for them until their  other stores are exhausted, and we can thus bring them within our view  and study their interesting ways, their modes of feeding, and, I fear I  must add, their squabbles also, for hungry birds are very pugnacious.

No one will get a word from him for hours, perhaps a day; no attempts at  conciliation will tempt him back to the game, no friendly talk will  chase the cloud from his face.  There he goes, slouching up the  playground into the house, and he will skulk upstairs to his study and  slam the door, and that's all we shall see of Tom till suppertime.    Once, I remember, young Jim Friendly, a new boy, tried hard to coax Tom  back into good humour.  They had been having a match at something, I  forget what, and Jim happened to say that something Tom did was against  the rules.  Tom, as usual, grew sulky and walked off.    \"What, you aren't going in?\" said Jim, disconcerted.  No answer.  \"I  didn't mean to offend you, old fellow; you may be right, after all.\"  No  answer.  \"I beg your pardon, Tom.  I wouldn't have said it if I thought  you'd have minded.\"  No answer.  \"Don't be angry with a fellow, I didn't  mean--\"    No answer.  And so Jim went on apologising, as if he had been all in the  wrong and the other all in the right, and getting no word in reply, only  the same scowl and uncompromising sullenness.  \"I'll take jolly good  care not to stroke that fellow the wrong way again,\" said Jim,  afterwards; \"and if I should, I won't waste my time in stroking him the  right way.\"    Just fancy what sort of man such a fellow as Tom is likely to turn out.  Is he likely to have many friends?  Unless he can get a few of his own  sort, I'm afraid he'll be rather badly off in that respect.  And then,  oh, horrors! fancy half a dozen Tom Sulks together!  What a happy family  they would be!  When Tom goes to business, he had better make up his  mind to start a concern of his own, for I'm afraid he would have some  difficulty in getting a partner, or, at any rate, keeping one.  I could  quite fancy some important question arising where Tom and his partner  might hold different views.  Tom insists he's right, the partner insists  he's right.  Tom consequently stays away for a week from the office,  during which the poor partner has to manage as best he can.    Whatever Tom will do about marrying I don't know; and when he is  married, what his wife will do, I know still less--it's no use  speculating on such a matter.  But now, letting Tom be, let us inquire  whether the sulky boy is more to be blamed than pitied.  That he is an  odious, disagreeable fellow, there is no doubt.  But perhaps it's not  _all_ his own fault.  Some boys are of duller natures than others.  The  high-spirited, healthy, sanguine fellow will flare up at a moment's  notice, and let fly without stopping to think twice of the injury done  him, while the dull boy is altogether slower in his movements: words  don't come to his lips so quickly, or thoughts don't rush into his mind  as promptly as in others; he is like the snail who, when offended,  shrinks back into its shell, leaving nothing but a hard, unyielding  exterior to mark his displeasure.  A great many boys are sulky because  they have not the boldness to be anything else; and a great many others  are so because to their small minds it is the grandest way of displaying  their wrath.  If only they could see how ridiculous they are!    I once knew two boys who for some time had been firm friends at school.  By some unlucky chance a misunderstanding occurred which interrupted  this friendship, and the grievance was, or appeared to be, so sore, that  neither boy would speak to the other.  Well, this went on for no less  than six months, and became the talk of the whole school.  These silly  boys, however, were so convinced of the sublimity of their respective  conducts that they never observed that every one was laughing at them.  Daily they passed one another, with eyes averted and noses high in the  air; daily they fed their memories with the recollection of their smart.  For six months never a word passed between them.  Then came the summer  holidays, in the course of which it suddenly occurred to both these  boys, being not altogether senseless boys, that after all they were  making themselves rather ridiculous.  And the more they thought of it,  the more ashamed of themselves they grew, till at last one sat down and  wrote,--    \"Dear Dick, I'm sorry I offended you; make it up,\" to which epistle  came, by return post, a reply,--    \"Dear Bob, _I'm_ sorry _I_ offended you; let's be friends.\"    And the first day of next term these two met and shook hands, and  laughed, and owned what fools they had both been.    A great many of the faults of this life come from the lack of a sense of  humour.  Certainly, if sulky boys had more of it, they would be inclined  to follow the example of these two.    But, although there is a great deal about the sulky boy that merits pity  rather than blame, there is much that deserves merciless censure.  Why  should one boy, by a whim of selfish resentment, mar the pleasure, not  only of those with whom he has his quarrel, but with every one else he  comes in contact with?  \"One dead fly,\" the proverb says, \"makes the  apothecary's ointment unsavoury\"; and one sulky boy, in like manner, may  destroy the harmony of a whole school.  Isn't it enough, if you must be  disagreeable, to confine your disagreeableness to those for whom it is  meant, without lugging a dozen other harmless fellows into the shadow of  it?  Do you really think so much of your own importance as to imagine  all the world will be interested in your quarrel with Smith, because he  insisted a thing was tweedledum and you insisted it was tweedledee?  Or,  if you have the grace to confine your sulkiness to Smith alone, for his  private benefit, do you imagine you will convince him of the error of  his ways by shutting yourself up and never looking or speaking to him?    It used to be a matter of frequent debate at school what ought to be  done to Tom Sulks.    \"Kick him,\" said some.  \"Laugh at him,\" said others.  \"Send him to  Coventry,\" put in a third.  \"Lecture him,\" advised others.  \"Let him  alone,\" said the rest.    And this, after all, is the best advice.  If a sulky fellow won't come  round of his own accord, no kicks, or laughs, or snubs, or lectures will  bring him.    Surely none of the readers of this chapter are sulky boys!  It is not to  be expected you will get through life without being put out--that is  sure to happen; and then you've three courses open to you: either to  take it like a man and a Christian, not rendering evil for evil, not  carried away by revengeful impulse, but bearing what can honourably be  borne with a good grace; and for the rest, if action is necessary,  righting yourself without malice or vindictiveness; or else you can fly  into a rage, and slog out blindly in wild passion; or you can sulk like  a cur in a corner, heeded by no one, yet disliked by all, and without a  friend--not even yourself.    You will know which of the three best becomes a British boy.  Be  assured, that which worst becomes him is _sulking_.        CHAPTER TEN.    THE EASY-GOING BOY.    It is a common complaint in these degenerate days that we live harder  than our fathers did.  Whatever we do we rush at.  We bolt our food, and  run for the train; we jump out of it before it has stopped, and reach  the school door just as the bell rings; we \"cram\" for our examinations,  and \"spurt\" for our prizes.  We have no time to read books, so we  scuttle through the reviews, and consider ourselves up in the subject;  we cut short our letters home, and have no patience to sit and hear a  long story out.  We race off with a chum for a week's holiday, and  consider we have dawdled unless we have covered our thirty miles a day,  and can name as visited a string of sights, mountains, lakes, and  valleys a full yard long.    If such charges are just (and they are, we fear, not wholly unfounded),  it is at least a satisfaction to know that there is one brilliant  exception to the rule, and that is in the person of Master Ned Easy.    Whatever other folk do, _he_ has no notion of hurrying himself.  Some  one once said of him that he was a fellow who looked as if he'd been  born with his hands in his pockets.  He takes his time about everything  he does.  If the breakfast bell rings before he is dressed, then--well,  breakfast must wait.  If breakfast is over before he has well begun,  then everybody else must wait while he, in a leisurely way, polishes off  his viands.  In the classes, his is sure to be the last paper to be  handed up; and when the boys are dismissed, he saunters forth to the  playground in the rear of all the others.  When he is one of a fishing-  party, and everybody but he is ready, he keeps them all waiting till  their patience is completely exhausted, while he gets together his  tackle, laces his boots, and selects his flies.    \"Come on! look alive!\" is the cry that is for ever being hurled at him,  \"All serene, old fellow; what's the hurry?\" is his invariable reply.    I well remember the first time I made Ned's acquaintance, and I will  recall the incident, as giving a fair specimen of the fellow and his  peculiarity.    It was a big cricket match, the afternoon was far advanced, the light  was getting uncertain, and time was almost up.  Our school's ninth  wicket had fallen, and yet there were five runs to get to win, which we  could just do, if our last man in was quick.    \"Now, Ned!\" calls out our captain, coming up to the tent; \"look sharp  in.\"    Ned coolly sat down on the bench in our tent and proceeded to put on a  pad.    \"Never mind about that! there's no time,\" said our captain impatiently,  \"and they are bowling slow.\"    \"Oh, it won't take a minute,\" says Ned, discovering he had been putting  the pad on upside down, and proceeding to undo it.  We stood round in  feverish impatience, and the minute consumed in putting on those  miserable leg-fenders seemed like a year.    Ned himself, however, did not seem in the least flurried by our  excitement.    \"Pity they don't"]]]
