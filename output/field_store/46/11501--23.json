Secondly, Schipfer's  scheme reflects the new consciousness of wider possibilities that were  coming into the world with the development of means of communication by  rail and steamboat. The author recommends the utility of his project by  referring to \"the new way of travelling.\"    3. De Rudelle, 1858--_Pantos-Dimon-Glossa._ De Rudelle was a  modern-language master in France and afterwards at the London  Polytechnic. His language is based on ten natural languages, especially  Greek, Latin, and the modern derivatives of Latin, with grammatical  hints from English, German, and Russian. It is remarkable for having  been the first to embody several principles of the first importance,  which have since been more fully carried out in other schemes, and are  now seen to be indispensable. Among these are: (1) distinction of the  parts of speech by a fixed form for each; (2) suppression of separate  verbal forms for each person; (3) formation of derivatives by means of  suffixes with fixed meanings.    4. Pirro, 1868--_Universalsprache_. Based upon five languages--French,  German, English, Italian, and Spanish--and containing a large proportion  of words from the Latin.    5. Ferrari, 1877--_Monoglottica_ (?).    6. Volk and Fuchs, 1883--_Weltsprache_. Founded on Latin.    7. Cesare Meriggi, 1884--_Blaia Zimondal_.    8. Courtonne, 1885--_Langue Internationale néo-Latine_. Based on the  modern Romance languages, and therefore not sufficiently international.  A peculiarity is that all roots are monosyllabic. The history of this  attempt illustrates the weight of inertia against which any such project  has to struggle. It was presented to the Scientific Society of Nice,  which drew up a report and sent it to all the learned societies of  Romance-speaking countries. Answers were received from three towns--Pau,  Sens, and Nimes. It was then proposed to convene an international  neo-Latin congress; but it is not surprising to hear that nothing came  of it.    9. Steiner, 1885--_Pasilingua_. A counterblast to Volapük. The author  aims at copying the methods of naturally formed international languages  like the \"lingua franca\" or Pidgin-English. Based on English, French,  and German; but the English vocabulary forms the groundwork.    10. Eichhorn, 1887--_Weltsprache_. Based on Latin. A leading principle  is that each part of speech ought to be recognizable by its form. Thus  nouns have two syllables; adjectives, three; pronouns, one; verbal  roots, one syllable beginning and ending with a consonant; and so on.    11. Zamenhof, 1887--_Esperanto_. (See below.)    12. Bernhard, 1888--_Lingua franca nuova_. A kind of bastard Italian.    13. Lauda, 1888--_Kosmos_. Draws all its vocabulary from Latin.    14. Henderson, 1888--_Lingua_. Latin vocabulary with modern grammar.    15. Henderson, 1902--_Latinesce_. A simpler and more practical  adaptation of Latin by the same author--_e.g._ the present infinitive  form does duty for several finite tenses, and words are used in their  modern senses.    16. Hoinix (pseudonym for the same indefatigable Mr. Henderson),  1889--_Anglo-franca_. A mixture of French and English. Both this and the  barbarized Latin schemes are fairly easy and certainly simpler than the  real languages, but they are shocking to the ear, and produce the effect  of mutilation of language.    17. Stempel, 1889--_Myrana_. Based on Latin with admixture of other  languages.    18. Stempel, 1894--_Communia_. A simplification of No. 17, with a new  name.    19. Rosa, 1890--_Nov Latin_. A set of rules for using the Latin  dictionary in a certain way as a key to produce something that can be  similarly deciphered.    20. Julius Lott, 1890--_Mundolingue_. Founded on Latin. Lott started an  international society for a universal language, proposing to build up  his language by collaboration of savants thus brought together.    21. Marini, 1891--_Méthode rapide, facile et certaine pour construire un  idiome universel_.    22. Liptay, 1892--_Langue catholique_. Based on the theory than an  international language already exists (in the words common to many  languages), and has only to be discovered.    23. Mill, 1893--_Anti-Volapük_. A simple universal grammar to be applied  to the vocabulary of each national language.    24.

Heintzeler compares the twelve chief  artificial languages already proposed, and shows that they have much in  common. He suggests a commission to work out a system on an eclectic  basis.    27. Beermann, 1895--_Novilatin_. Latin brought up to date by comparison  with six chief modern languages.    28. _Le Linguist_, 1896-7. A monthly review conducted by a band of  philologists. It contains many discussions of the principles which  should underly an international language, and suggestions, but no  complete scheme.    29. Puchner, 1897--_Nuove Roman_. Based largely on Spanish, which the  author considers the best of the Romance tongues.    30. Nilson--_La vest-europish central-dialekt_ (1890); _Lasonebr, un  transitional lingvo_ (1897); _Il dialekt Centralia, un compromiss  entr il lingu universal de Akademi international e la vest-europish  central-dialekt_ (1899).    31. Kürschner, 1900--_Lingua Komun_. The author was an Esperantist,  but found Esperanto not scientific enough. It is almost incredible  that a man who knew Esperanto should invent a language with several  conjugations of the verb, but this is what Kürschner has done.    32.

III                          THE EARLIEST BRITISH ATTEMPT    A perusal of the foregoing list shows that in the early days of the  search for an international language the British were well to the fore.  Of the British pioneers in this field the first two were Scots--a fact  which accords well with the traditional enterprise north of the Tweed,  and readiness to look abroad, beyond their own noses, or, in this case,  beyond their own tongues. It is likewise remarkable that the British  have almost dropped out of the running in recent times, as far as  origination is concerned. Is this fact also typical, a small symptom  of Jeshurun's general fatness? Does it reflect a lesser degree of  nimbleness in moving with the spirit of the times?    Anyhow, in this case the Briton's content with what he has got at home  is well grounded. He certainly possesses a first-class language. As a  curious example of the quaint use of it by a scholar and clever man in  the middle of the seventeenth century, the following account of Sir  Thomas Urquhart's book may be of some interest.    Sir Thomas is well known as the translator of Rabelais; and evidently  something of the curious erudition, polyglotism, and quaintness of  conceit of his author stuck to the translator. This book is the rarest  of his tracts, all of which are uncommon, and has been hardly more than  mentioned by name by the previous writers on the subject.

Oh, that thou wouldest conceal me  In the realm of departed souls!  Hide me in secret, till thy wrath be past;  Appoint me then a new term,  And remember me again.  But alas! if a man die  Shall he live again?    So long, then, as my toil endureth,  Will I wait till a change come to me.  Thou wilt call me, and I shall answer;  Thou wilt pity the work of thy hands.  Though now thou numberest my steps,  Thou shalt then not watch for my sin.  My transgression will be sealed in a bag,  Thou wilt bind up and remove my iniquity.    Yet alas! the mountain falleth and is swallowed up,  The rock is removed out of its place,  The waters hollow out the stones,  The floods overflow the dust of the earth,  And thus, thou destroyest the hope of man.    Thou contendest with him, till he faileth,  Thou changest his countenance, and sendeth him away.  Though his sons become great and happy,  Yet he knoweth it not;  If they come to shame and dishonor,  He perceiveth it not.

(102)    Charles James Fox, 1749-1806, a famous English orator and statesman, was  the son of Hon. Henry Fox, afterward Lord Holland; he was also a lineal  descendant of Charles II. of England and of Henry IV, of France. He  received his education at Westminster, Eton, and Oxford, but left the  University without graduating. He was first elected to Parliament before  he was twenty years old. During the American Revolution, he favored the  colonies; later, he was a friend and fellow-partisan both with Burke and  Wilberforce. Burke said of him, \"He is the most brilliant and successful  debater the world ever saw.\" In his later years, Mr. Fox was as remarkable  for carelessness in dress and personal appearance, as he had been for the  opposite in his youth. He possessed many pleasing traits of character, but  his morals were not commendable; he was a gambler and a spendthrift. Yet  he exercised a powerful influence on the politics of his times. This  extract is from a speech delivered during a truce in the long war between  England and France.  ###      \"But we must pause,\" says the honorable gentleman. What! must the bowels  of Great Britain be torn out, her best blood spilt, her treasures wasted,  that you may make an experiment? Put yourselves--Oh! that you would put  yourselves on the field of battle, and learn to judge of the sort of  horrors you excite. In former wars, a man might at least have some  feeling, some interest, that served to balance in his mind the impressions  which a scene of carnage and death must inflict.    But if a man were present now at the field of slaughter, and were to  inquire for what they were fighting--\"Fighting!\", would be the answer;  \"they are not fighting; they are pausing.\" \"Why is that man expiring? Why  is that other writhing with agony? What means this implacable fury?\" The  answer must be, \"You are quite wrong, sir, you deceive yourself,--they are  not fighting,--do not disturb them,--they are merely pausing! This man is  not expiring with agony,--that man is not dead,--he is only pausing! Bless  you, sir, they are not angry with one another; they have now no cause of  quarrel; but their country thinks that there should be a pause. All that  you see is nothing like fighting,--there is no harm, nor cruelty, nor  bloodshed in it; it is nothing more than a political pause. It is merely  to try an experiment--to see whether Bonaparte will not behave himself  better than heretofore; and, in the meantime, we have agreed to a pause,  in pure friendship!\"    And is this the way that you are to show yourselves the advocates of  order? You take up a system calculated to uncivilize the world, to destroy  order, to trample on religion, to stifle in the heart not merely the  generosity of noble sentiment, but the affections of social nature; and in  the prosecution of this system, you spread terror and devastation all  around you.      Note.--In this lesson, the influence of a negative in determining the  rising inflection, is noticeable. See Rule V, p. 24.        XVI. MY EXPERIENCE IN ELOCUTION. (104)    John Neal. 1793-1876, a brilliant but eccentric American writer, was born  in Portland, Maine. He went into business, when quite young, in company  with John Pierpont, the well-known poet. They soon failed, and Mr. Neal  then turned his attention to the study of law. He practiced his profession  somewhat, but devoted most of his time to literature. For a time he  resided in England, where he wrote for \"Blackwood's Magazine\" and other  periodicals. His writings were produced with great rapidity, and with a  purposed disregard of what is known as \"classical English.\"  ###      In the academy I attended, elocution was taught in a way I shall never  forget--never! We had a yearly exhibition, and the favorites of the  preceptor were allowed to speak a piece; and a pretty time they had of it.  Somehow I was never a favorite with any of my teachers after the first two  or three days; and, as I went barefooted, I dare say it was thought  unseemly, or perhaps cruel, to expose me upon the platform. And then, as I  had no particular aptitude for public speaking, and no relish for what was  called oratory, it was never my luck to be called up.    Among my schoolmates, however, was one--a very amiable, shy boy--to whom  was assigned, at the first exhibition I attended, that passage in Pope's  Homer beginning with,      \"Aurora, now, fair daughter of the dawn!\"    This the poor boy gave with so much emphasis and discretion, that, to me,  it sounded like \"O roarer!\" and I was wicked enough, out of sheer envy, I  dare say, to call him \"O roarer!\"--a nickname which clung to him for a  long while, though no human being ever deserved it less; for in speech and  action both, he was quiet, reserved, and sensitive.    My next experience in elocution was still more disheartening, so that I  never had a chance of showing what I was capable of in that way till I set  up for myself. Master Moody, my next instructor, was thought to have  uncommon qualifications for teaching oratory. He was a large, handsome,  heavy man, over six feet high; and having understood that the first,  second, and third prerequisite in oratory was action, the boys he put in  training were encouraged to most vehement and obstreperous manifestations.  Let me give an example, and one that weighed heavily on my conscience for  many years after the poor man passed away.    Among his pupils were two boys, brothers, who were thought highly gifted  in elocution. The master, who was evidently of that opinion, had a habit  of parading them on all occasions before visitors and strangers; though  one bad lost his upper front teeth and lisped badly, and the other had the  voice of a penny trumpet. Week after week these boys went through the  quarrel of Brutus and Cassius, for the benefit of myself and others, to  see if their example would not provoke us to a generous competition for  all the honors.    How it operated on the other boys in after life I can not say; but the  effect on me was decidedly unwholesome--discouraging, indeed,--until I was  old enough to judge for myself, and to carry into operation a system of my  own.    On coming to the passage,--      \"Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;     Dash him to pieces!\"--    the elder of the boys gave it after the following fashion: \"Be ready,  godths, with all your thunderbolths,--dath him in pietheth!\"--bringing  his right fist down into his left palm with all his strength, and his  lifted foot upon the platform, which was built like a sounding-board, so  that the master himself, who had suggested the action and obliged the poor  boy to rehearse it over and over again, appeared to be utterly carried  away by the magnificent demonstration; while to me--so deficient was I in  rhetorical taste--it sounded like a crash of broken crockery, intermingled  with chicken peeps.    I never got over it; and to this day can not endure stamping, nor even  tapping of the foot, nor clapping the hands together, nor thumping the  table for illustration; having an idea that such noises are not oratory,  and that untranslatable sounds are not language.    My next essay was of a somewhat different kind. I took the field in  person, being in my nineteenth year, well proportioned, and already  beginning to have a sincere relish for poetry, if not for declamation. I  had always been a great reader; and in the course of my foraging  depredations I had met with \"The Mariner's Dream\" and \"The Lake of the  Dismal Swamp,\" both of which I had committed to memory before I knew it.    And one day, happening to be alone with my sister, and newly rigged out in  a student's gown, such as the lads at Brunswick sported when they came to  show off among their old companions, I proposed to astonish her by  rehearsing these two poems in appropriate costume. Being very proud of her  brother, and very obliging, she consented at once,--upon condition that  our dear mother, who had never seen anything of the sort, should be  invited to make one of the audience.    On the whole, I rather think that I succeeded in astonishing both. I well  remember their looks of amazement--for they had never seen anything better  or worse in all their lives, and were no judges of acting--as I swept to  and fro in that magnificent robe, with outstretched arms and uplifted  eyes, when I came to passages like the following, where an apostrophe was  called for:      \"And near him the she wolf stirred the brake,      And the copper snake breathed in his ear,    Till he, starting, cried, from his dream awake,      'Oh, when shall I see the dusky lake,      And the white canoe of my dear'!'\"    Or like this:      \"On beds of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid;    Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow,    Of thy fair"]]]
