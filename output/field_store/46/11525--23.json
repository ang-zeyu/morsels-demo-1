So Bud thanked him gravely, but with a twinkle in his eyes, and waited  until Hen had gone and he was alone before he read the message. It was  mysterious enough, certainly. Hen had written in a fine, cramped, uneven  hand:    \"You bee carful. bern this up and dent let on like you no anything but  i warn you be shure bern this up.\"    Bud tore out the page and burned it as requested, and since he was not  enlightened by the warning he obeyed Hen's instructions and did not \"let  on.\" But he could not help wondering, and was unconsciously prepared to  observe little things which ordinarily would have passed unnoticed.    At the dance on Friday night, for instance, there was a good deal of  drinking and mighty little hilarity. Bud had been accustomed to loud  talk and much horseplay outside among the men on such occasions, and  even a fight or two would be accepted as a matter of course. But though  several quart bottles were passed around during the night and thrown  away empty into the bushes, the men went in and danced and came out  again immediately to converse confidentially in small groups, or to  smoke without much speech. The men of Burroback Valley were not running  true to form.    The women were much like all the women of cow-country: mothers with  small children who early became cross and sleepy and were hushed under  shawls on the most convenient bed, a piece of cake in their hands;  mothers whose faces were lined too soon with work and ill-health, and  with untidy hair that became untidier as the dance progressed. There  were daughters--shy and giggling to hide their shyness--Bud knew their  type very well and made friends with them easily, and immediately became  the centre of a clamoring audience after he had sung a song or two.    There was Honey, with her inscrutable half smile and her veiled eyes,  condescending to graciousness and quite plainly assuming a proprietary  air toward Bud, whom she put through whatever musical paces pleased her  fancy. Bud, I may say, was extremely tractable. When Honey said sing,  Bud sang; when she said play, Bud sat down to the piano and played  until she asked him to do something else. It was all very pleasant for  Honey--and Bud ultimately won his point--Honey decided to extend her  graciousness a little.    Why hadn't Bud danced with Marian? He must go right away and ask her  to dance. Just because Lew was gone, Marian need not be slighted--and  besides, there were other fellows who might want a little of Honey's  time.    So Bud went away and found Marian in the pantry, cutting cakes while the  coffee boiled, and asked her to dance. Marian was too tired, and' she  had not the time to spare; wherefore Bud helped himself to a knife  and proceeded to cut cakes with geometrical precision, and ate all  the crumbs. With his hands busy, he found the courage to talk to her a  little. He made Marian laugh out loud and it was the first time he had  ever heard her do that.    Marian disclosed a sense of humor, and even teased Bud a little about  Honey. But her teasing lacked that edge of bitterness which Bud had half  expected in retaliation for Honey's little air of superiority.    \"Your precision in cutting cakes is very much like your accurate  fingering of the piano,\" she observed irrelevantly, surveying his  work with her lips pursed. \"A pair of calipers would prove every piece  exactly, the same width; and even when you play a Meditation? I'm  sure the metronome would waggle in perfect unison with your tempo. I  wonder--\" She glanced up at him speculatively. \"--I wonder if you think  with such mathematical precision. Do you always find that two and two  make four?\"    \"You mean, have I any imagination whatever?\" Bud looked away from her  eyes--toward the uncurtained, high little window. A face appeared there,  as if a tall man had glanced in as he was passing by and halted for a  second to look. Bud's eyes met full the eyes of the man outside, who  tilted his head backward in a significant movement and passed on. Marian  turned her head and caught the signal, looked at Bud quickly, a little  flush creeping into her cheeks.    \"I hope you have a little imagination,\" she said, lowering her voice  instinctively. \"It doesn't require much to see that Jerry is right. The  conventions are strictly observed at Little Lost--in the kitchen, at  least,\" she added, under her breath, with a flash of resentment. \"Run  along--and the next time Honey asks you to play the piano, will you  please play Lotusblume? And when you have thrown open the prison windows  with that, will you play Schubert's Ave Maria--the way you play it--to  send a breath of cool night air in?\"    She put out the tips of her fingers and pressed them lightly against  Bud's shoulder, turning toward the door. Bud started, stepped into the  kitchen, wheeled about and stood regarding her with a stubborn look in  his eyes.    \"I might kick the door down, too,\" he said. \"I don't like prisons  nohow.\"    \"No-just a window, thank you,\" she laughed.    Bud thought the laugh did not go very deep. \"Jerry wants to talk to  you. He's the whitest of the lot, if you can call that--\" she stopped  abruptly, put out a hand to the door, gave him a moment to look into her  deep, troubled eyes, and closed the door gently but inexorably in his  face.    Jerry was standing at the corner of the house smoking negligently. He  waited until Bud had come close alongside him, then led the way slowly  down the path to the corrals.    \"I thought I heard the horses fighting,\" he remarked. \"There was a noise  down this way.\"    \"Is that why you called me outside?\" asked Bud, who scorned subterfuge.    \"Yeah. I saw you wasn't dancing or singing or playing the piano--and  I knew Honey'd likely be looking you up to do one or the other, in a  minute. She sure likes you, Bud. She don't, everybody that comes along.\"    Bud did not want to discuss Honey, wherefore he made no reply, and they  walked along in silence, the cool, heavy darkness grateful after the oil  lamps and the heat of crowded rooms. As they neared the corrals a stable  door creaked open and shut, yet there was no wind. Jerry halted, one  hand going to Bud's arm. They stood for a minute, and heard the swish of  the bushes behind the corral, as if a horse were passing through. Jerry  turned back, leading Bud by the arm. They were fifty feet away and the  bushes were still again before Jerry spoke guardedly.    \"I guess I made a mistake. There wasn't nothing,\" he said, and dropped  Bud's arm.    Bud stopped. \"There was a man riding off in the brush,\" he said bluntly,  \"and all the folks that came to the dance rode in through the front  gate. I reckon I'll just take a look where I left my saddle, anyway.\"    \"That might have been some loose stock,\" Jerry argued, but Bud went  back, wondering a little at Jerry's manner.    The saddle was all right, and so was everything else, so far as Bud  could determine in the dark, but he was not satisfied. He thought he  understood Jerry's reason for bringing him down to the corrals, but he  could not understand Jerry's attitude toward an incident which any man  would have called suspicious.    Bud quietly counted noses when he returned to the house and found that  supper was being served, but he could not recall any man who was missing  now. Every guest and every man on the ranch was present except old Pop,  who had a little shack to himself and went to bed at dark every night.    Bud was mystified, and he hated mysteries. Moreover, he was working for  Dave Truman, and whatever might concern Little Lost concerned him also.  But the men had begun to talk openly of their various \"running horses\",  and to exchange jibes and boasts and to bet a little on Sunday's races.  Bud wanted to miss nothing of that, and Jerry's indifference to the  incident at the stable served to reassure him for the time being. He  edged close to the group where the talk was loudest, and listened.    A man they called Jeff was trying to jeer his neighbors into betting  against a horse called Skeeter, and was finding them too cautious for  his liking. He laughed and, happening to catch Bud's eyes upon him,  strode forward with an empty tin cup in his hand and slapped Bud  friendliwise on the shoulder.    \"Why, I bet this singin' kid, that don't know wha I got ner what you  fellers has got, ain't scared to take, a chance. Are yuh, kid? What d'  yuh think of this pikin' bunch here that has seen Skeeter come in second  and third more times 'n what he beat, and yet is afraid to take a chance  on rosin' two bits? Whatd' yuh think of 'em? Ain't they an onery bunch?\"    \"I suppose they hate to lose,\" Bud grinned.    \"That's it--money 's more to 'em than the sport of kings, which is  runnin' horses. This bunch, kid belly-ached till Dave took his horse  Boise outa the game, and now, by gosh, they're backin' up from my  Skeeter, that has been beat more times than he won.'    \"When you pulled him, Jeff!\" a mocking voice drawled. \"And that was when  you wasn't bettin' yourself.\"    Jeff turned injuredly to Bud. \"Now don't that sound like a piker?\" he  complained. \"It ain't reason to claim I'd pull my own horse. Ain't that  the out doinest way to come back at a man that likes a good race?\"    Bud swelled his chest and laid his hand on Jeff's shoulder. \"Just  to show you I'm not a piker,\" he cried recklessly, \"I'll bet you  twenty-five dollars I can beat your Skeeter with my Smoky horse that I  rode in here. Is it a go?\"    Jeff's jaw dropped a little, with surprise. \"What fer horse is this here  Smoky horse of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#18)"],[1,"senses; but--\"    \"What is this religion that has caused her to err so badly?\"    \"Why, she calls herself a Latter-day Saint.\"    \"What!\"    \"Yes; I've tried to reason with the girl, but it's been no use.\"    \"I want to see her--now, today,\" said Henrik. \"Give me her address.\"    \"Shall I go with you?\"    \"No, I can find her,--you need not bother.\"    Henrik obtained the proper directions, and set out immediately. Was  there then one other of his family that had received the gospel--one  that could help him? He boarded a car, getting off at the store. Going  to the department in which she worked, he asked the floor-walker where  he could find Miss Bogstad. Then he saw her behind a counter, resting  for a moment, unoccupied. Though she was an American, Henrik could see  the Norwegian traits in his fair cousin. She was of the dark type, with  round, rosy lips and cheeks, and heavy, brown hair.    \"I am your cousin Henrik from Norway,\" he said as he shook her hand.    Her smile burst into a soft, merry laugh as she greeted him. \"I am glad  to see you,\" she said. \"I heard you were here, but thought perhaps I  might not get to meet you.\"    He held her hand a long time, as he looked into the pretty, sweet face.  Had he been an American, he would, no doubt, have kissed her then and  there; but being a Norwegian, he only looked his wonder and pleasure.    They could not talk much because customers had to be served; but Henrik  lingered until closing time, saying he would walk home with her that  they might talk. She expressed her pleasure at the proposition; and  promptly at the closing gong, she donned her wraps and joined him. The  day was warm, and he suggested a walk around by the park, where they  might sit down on a bench under the trees.    It was a difficult matter for seriously minded Uncle Jens and his family  to laugh, and even a smile was seldom seen on their faces; but here was  one who seemed bubbling over with merriment--one whose countenance shone  as if from an inner light of happiness.    \"Rachel,\" said Henrik, \"your father has told me about you.\"    \"Yes,\" she replied with sobering face, \"they think I am a very bad  girl,--but--\"    \"Look here cousin, don't make any apologies. I know, and understand.\"    He asked her some questions about herself, all of which she answered  frankly. Then he told her about himself, which she first met with an  astonished stare. He narrated his experiences in Norway, of his trip  westward, and the real purpose of his coming to Minnesota. She heard his  story with alternating smiles and tears, as it touched her heart. They  sat thus for a long time, oblivious to the singing birds above, of the  curious passers-by, or the fast falling night. They walked home in the  lighted streets, and it was late when he bade her goodnight at the gate.    The next day Henrik had a talk with Uncle Jens which ended in the  uncle's closing with a bang the open Bible on the table out of which  they had been reading, and then in uncontrolled rage ordering his nephew  out of the house. Henrik tried to make peace with his uncle, but it  proved useless, so he took his hat and left.    Henrik met Rachel again that evening, and again they sat on the bench  under the trees. Once again they became lost to all outward disturbances  in the deep concerns which brooded in their hearts and found utterance  in their speech.    \"I shall remain here a few days more,\" said he in conclusion, \"because I  want to get better acquainted with you; and then we must talk over our  plans further. Then I shall go back to Norway. In a few months I shall  come back, and we two shall go westward where the Temples are, and there  begin the work that is ours--the work that the Lord has called us to do.  What do you say to that?\"    \"Thank you,\" she replied simply, and with her usual smile; \"I shall be  ready.\"          XIV.      \"Rend your heart and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your    God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great    kindness.\"--_Joel 2:13._      On Henrik's arrival in Norway, the harvesting was in full swing, and he  busied himself with that. His friends, some of whom were surprised at  his return, asked him what he had found in America, and he told them  freely. Had he discovered the delusion in his American religion? No, he  replied, his faith had been made stronger. Selma had relented somewhat,  she making him welcome at her home in Christiania. Here he also met  Marie. Henrik treated her as a friend with whom he had never had  differences. When she saw him back again, browned and hardy, but the  same gentle Henrik, Marie wondered, and by that wonder her resentment  was modified, and she listened to his accounts of America and his  relatives in Minnesota with much interest. As he spoke with an added  enthusiasm of his cousin Rachel, the listeners opened their ears and  eyes. He told them freely of his plans, and what he and Rachel were  going to do.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I can see the hand of the Lord in my finding  Rachel.\"--Marie had her doubts, but she said nothing.--\"It is all so  wonderful to me, and I am only sorry that you folks can't see it!\" But  they replied nothing.    Henrik wrote often to Rachel, and the letters which he received in reply  he usually handed to Selma, and Marie, if she was present. They  pronounced them fine letters. \"She must be a jolly girl,\" they said.    \"She is,\" he affirmed; \"the most religious and yet the merriest girl I  have ever met. That seems a contradiction, but it isn't.\" Then he went  on explaining, and they could not help listening. Henrik studied the two  young women to see what impression he might be making. On Selma there  was very little, but he believed Marie was overcoming some of her  prejudice. Selma told him that Marie loved him as much as ever, and that  if he deserted her, it would break her heart.    \"But Selma,\" he exclaimed, \"I have never deserted her. It was she who  broke the engagement.\"    \"How could she do otherwise;--but she has been waiting, and will still  wait in hope.\"    \"I, too, shall do that,\" he said.           *       *       *       *       *    That fall Henrik again sailed for America. Going westward by way of  Minnesota, he called for Rachel and took her with him. In one of the  Temple cities they found lodgings with some of his friends, and then  they entered upon their work for their ancestors. Henrik had a long list  of them, and so they were kept busy nearly all the winter. At the end  of three months, Henrik asked Rachel if she was tired and wanted a rest.    \"Oh, no,\" she said; \"I believe I can do this work all my life. It isn't  always easy, but there is so much joy and peace in it. I believe the  angels are with us, and I don't want better company.\"    And so these two were very much contented. They sent letters home  telling of the \"glorious\" time they were having, and the work they were  doing. At the opening of spring, Henrik left Rachel to continue the  work, he having to go back to Norway. He asked her if she desired to  return to her folks in Minnesota, but she said no, not yet.    The early spring months found Henrik in Christiania. He made a trip to  Denmark on genealogical research which proved quite successful. The  first of June found him back to Nordal.    Midsummer Night came clear and cool. Henrik was in Christiania, and was  to be one of a party to spend the night on the hills above the city.  Marie was not with them, and Henrik enquired the reason.    \"She is ill,\" said Selma.    \"Ill? Where is she?\"    \"At home. I think you should go and see her.\"    \"Does she want me?\"    \"Yes.\"    Henrik excused himself from the party and went immediately to Marie. He  found her on the veranda, reclining on a couch. The lamp-light from an  open window fell on a pale face, startling in its changed expression. He  silently took her hand, her fingers tightening in his grasp. She looked  him steadily in the face, her swimming eyes not wavering. Then Henrik  knew that he loved this girl yet. For a long time he had tried to forget  her, tried to root out his love for her, tried to think that she was not  for him. \"I'll not try again,\" he had thought, \"for twice now have I  been disappointed;\" but now a flood of compassionate love engulfed him,  and he, too, clung to the fingers in his grasp.    \"I am sorry to see you like this,\" he said, \"what is the matter?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Doesn't the doctor know?\"    She shook her head with a faint smile. \"Sit down, Henrik, I want to talk  to you,\" she said.    He took the low chair by her side. The mother looked at them from the  door-way, but did not come out.    \"I want you to forgive me,\" she said.    \"That has been done long ago.\"    \"Thank you--now listen. I have been wrong, wickedly wrong, it seems to  me--listen! I have not been honest, neither with you, nor myself, nor  with the Lord--which is the worst of all. I understood much that you  taught me of the restored gospel--It seemed so easy to my understanding;  but my pride was in the way, and I would not accept the light. I pushed  it away. I kept saying to myself, 'It isn't true,' when I knew all the  time that it was. That's the sin I have committed.\"    \"My dear--\"    \"You remember that book you asked me to read? Well, I read it through,  though I led you to believe that I did not. It is a beautiful book, and  true, every word. * * * Perhaps you will not believe me when I tell you  that I have been a number of times to your meetings in Osterhausgade.  Once when you were there--I thought you would see me,\" she smiled. \"And  I could find no faults, though at first I went looking for them * * *  Now, I've told you. You have forgiven me, you say; but will the Lord?\"    \"Yes; the Lord is good.\"    \"When I get better--if I do--I am going to join the Church as you have  done. That is the right thing to do, isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And then, may I go to where you and your cousin"]]]
