They  lay eight or nine eggs, and sit about three weeks,--the cock  alternately with the hen. The nest in the thorn-bush is placed usually  so high above the surface of the water, they cannot climb into it  again; but, as a substitute, within an hour after they leave the nest,  the cock bird builds a larger and more roomy nest for them, with  sedges, at the water's edge, which they can enter or retire from at  pleasure. For about a month they are fed by the old birds, but soon  become very active in taking flies and water-insects. Immediately on  the second hatch coming out, the young ones of the first hatch assist  the old ones in feeding and hovering over them, leading them out in  detached parties, and making additional nests for them, similar to  their own, on the brink of the moat.    \"But it is not only in their instinctive attachments and habits that  they merit notice; the following anecdote proves that they are gifted  with a sense of observation approaching to something very like  reasoning faculties.    \"At a gentleman's house in Staffordshire, the pheasants are fed out of  one of those boxes described in page 287, the lid of which rises with  the pressure of the pheasant standing on the rail in front of the box.  A water-hen observing this, went and stood upon the rail as soon as the  pheasant had quitted it; but the weight of the bird being insufficient  to raise the lid of the box, so as to enable it to get at the corn, the  water-hen kept jumping on the rail to give additional impetus to its  weight: this partially succeeded, but not to the satisfaction of the  sagacious bird. Accordingly it went off, and soon returning with a bird  of its own species, the united weight of the two had the desired  effect, and the successful pair enjoyed the benefit of their ingenuity.    \"We can vouch for the truth of this singular instance of penetration,  on the authority of the owner of the place where it occurred, and who  witnessed the fact.\"    121. But although in these sagacities, and teachablenesses, the bird  has much in common with land poultry, it seems not a link between these  and water-fowl; but to be properly placed by the ornithologists between  the rail and the coot: this latter being the largest of the fringefoots,  singularly dark in color, and called 'fulica' (sooty), or, with  insistence, 'fulica atra' (black sooty), or even 'fulica aterrima'  (blackest sooty). 'Coot' is said by Johnson to be Dutch; and that it  became 'cotee' in French; but I cannot find cotee in my French  dictionary. In the meantime, putting the coot and water-hen aside for  future better knowledge, we may be content with the pentagonal group of  our dabchicks--passing at each angle into another tribe, thus,--(if  people must classify, they at least should also _map_). Take the Ouzel,  Allegret, Grebe, Fairy, and Rail, and, only giving the Fairy her Latin  name, write their fourpenny-worth of initial letters (groat) round a  pentagon set on its base, putting the Ouzel at the top angle,--so.  Then, the Ouzels pass up into Blackbirds, the Rails to the left into  Woodcocks, the Allegrets to the right into Plovers, the Grebes, down  left, into Ducks, and the Titanias, down right, into Gulls. And  _there's_ a bit of pentagonal Darwinism for you, if you like it, and  learn it, which will be really good for something in the end, or the  five ends.    122. And for the bliss of classification pure, with no ends of any sort  or any number, referring my reader to the works of ornithologists in  general, and for what small portion of them he may afterwards care to  consult, to my Appendix, I will end this lecture, and this volume, with  the refreshment for us of a piece of perfect English and exquisite wit,  falling into verse,--the Chorus of the Birds, in Mr. Courthope's  Paradise of them,--a book lovely, and often faultless, in most of its  execution, but little skilled or attractive in plan, and too thoughtful  to be understood without such notes as a good author will not write on  his own work; partly because he has not time, and partly because he  always feels that if people won't look for his meaning, they should not  be told it. My own special function, on the contrary, is, and always  has been, that of the Interpreter only, in the 'Pilgrim's Progress;'  and I trust that Mr. Courthope will therefore forgive my arranging his  long cadence of continuous line so as to come symmetrically into my own  page, (thus also enforcing, for the inattentive, the rhymes which he is  too easily proud to insist on,) and my division of the whole chorus  into equal strophe and antistrophe of six lines each, in which,  counting from the last line of the stanza, the reader can easily catch  the word to which my note refers.    123.     We wish to declare,                  How the birds of the air           All high institutions designed,           And, holding in awe                  Art, Science, and Law,           Delivered the same to mankind.                   6             To begin with; of old                  Man went naked, and cold,           Whenever it pelted or froze,           Till _we_ showed him how feathers                  Were proof against weathers,           With that, _he_ bethought him of hose.          12             And next, it was plain,                  That he, in the rain,           Was forced to sit dripping and blind,           While the Reed-warbler swung                  In a nest, with her young           Deep sheltered, and warm, from the wind.        18             So our homes in the boughs                  Made _him_ think of the House;           And the Swallow, to help him invent,           Revealed the best way                  To economize clay,           And bricks to combine with cement.              24             The knowledge withal                  Of the Carpenter's awl,           Is drawn from the Nuthatch's bill;           And the Sand-Martin's pains                  In the hazel-clad lanes           Instructed the Mason to drill.                  30             Is there _one_ of the Arts,                  More dear to men's hearts?

The state of things at Rome is this: the senate is a perfect  Areopagus. You cannot conceive anything firmer, more grave, or more  high-spirited. For when the day came for proposing the bill in  accordance with the vote of the senate, a crowd of our dandies with  their chin-tufts assembled, all the Catiline set, with Curio's girlish  son at their head, and implored the people to reject it. Moreover, Piso  the consul, who formally introduced the bill, spoke against it.  Clodius's hired ruffians had filled up the entrances to the voting  boxes. The voting tickets were so manipulated that no \"ayes\" were  distributed. Hereupon imagine Cato hurrying to the rostra, delivering an  admirable invective against the consul, if we can call that an  \"invective\" which was really a speech of the utmost weight and  authority, and in fact containing the most salutary advice. He is  followed to the same effect by your friend Hortensius, and many  loyalists besides, among whom, however, the contribution of Favonius was  conspicuous. By this rally of the Optimates the _comitia_ is dissolved,  the senate summoned. On the question being put in a full house--in spite  of the opposition of Piso, and in spite of Clodius throwing himself at  the feet of the senators one after the other--that the consuls should  exhort the people to pass the bill, about fifteen voted with Curio, who  was against any decree being passed; on the other side there were fully  four hundred. So the vote passed. The tribune Fufius then gave in.[89]  Clodius delivered some wretched speeches to the people, in which he  bestowed some injurious epithets on Lucullus, Hortensius, C. Piso, and  the consul Messalla; me he only charged with having \"discovered\"  everything.[90] In regard to the assignation of provinces to the  praetors, the hearing legations, and other business, the senate voted  that nothing should be brought before it till the bill had been brought  before the people. There's the state of things at Rome for you. Yet pray  listen to this one thing more which has surpassed my hopes. Messalla is  a superlatively good consul, courageous, firm, painstaking; he praises,  shows attachment to, and imitates me. That other one (Piso) is the less  mischievous because of one vice--he is lazy, sleepy, unbusiness-like, an  utter _faineant_, but in intention he is so disaffected that he has  begun to loathe Pompey since he made the speech in which some praise was  bestowed on the senate. Accordingly, he has alienated all the loyalists  to a remarkable degree. And his action is not dictated by love for  Clodius more than by a taste for a profligate policy and a profligate  party. But he has nobody among the magistrates like himself, with the  single exception of the tribune Fufius. The tribunes are excellent, and  in Cornutus we have a quasi-Cato. Can I say more?    Now to return to private matters. \"Teucris\" has fulfilled her  promise.[91] Pray execute the commission you undertook. My brother  Quintus, who purchased the remaining three-fourths of the house in the  Argiletum for 725 sestertia (about L5,800), is now trying to sell his  Tusculan property, in order to purchase, if he can, the town house of  Pacilius. Make it up with Lucceius! I see that he is all agog to stand  for the consulship. I will do my best. Be careful to let me know exactly  how you are, where you are, and how your business goes on.    13 February.    [Footnote 85: The letter giving this description is lost. I think  _frigebat_ is epistolary imperfect--\"_he_ is in the cold shade,\" not,  \"_it_ fell flat.\"]    [Footnote 86: [Greek: panegyris]. Cicero uses the word (an honourable  one in Greek) contemptuously of the rabble brought together at a  market.]    [Footnote 87: Pompey's general commendation of the decrees of the senate  would include those regarding the Catiline conspirators, and he  therefore claimed to have satisfied Cicero.]    [Footnote 88: _Meis omnibus litteris_, the MS. reading. Prof. Tyrrell's  emendation, _orationibus meis, omnibus litteris_, \"in my speeches, every  letter of them,\" seems to me even harsher than the MS., a gross  exaggeration, and doubtful Latin. _Meis litteris_ is well supported by  _literae forenses et senatoriae_ of _de Off._ 2, Sec. 3, and though it is an  unusual mode of referring to speeches, we must remember that they were  now published and were \"literature.\" The particular reference is to the  speech _pro Imperio Pompeii_, in which, among other things, the whole  credit of the reduction of Spartacus's gladiators is given to Pompey,  whereas the brunt of the war had been borne by Crassus.]    [Footnote 89: Fufius, though Cicero does not say so, must have vetoed  the decree, but in the face of such a majority withdrew his veto. The  practice seems to have been, in case of tribunician veto, to take the  vote, which remained as an _auctoritas senatus_, but was not a _senatus  consultum_ unless the tribune was induced to withdraw.]    [Footnote 90: _Comperisse_.

Now then, considering how desirous of a good reputation  he and I have ever been, and how unusually Philhellenic we are and have  the reputation of being, and considering how many there are whose enmity  we have incurred for the sake of the Republic, \"call to mind all your  valour,\"[92] to secure us the praise and affection of all concerned. I  will write at greater length to you on these points in the letter which  I shall give to Quintus himself.[93] Please let me know what you have  done about the business I confided to you, and also in your own affair;  for I have had no letter from you since you left Brundisium. I am very  anxious to hear how you are.    15 March.    [Footnote 92: [Greek: pantoies aretes mimneskeo] (Hom. _Il._ xxii. 8)]    [Footnote 93: The allotment of provinces had been put off (see last  letter) till the affair of Clodius's trial was settled; consequently  Quintus would not have much time for preparation, and would soon set  out. He would cross to Dyrrachium, and proceed along the _via Egnatia_  to Thessalonica. He might meet Atticus at Dyrrachium, or go out of his  way to call on him at Buthrotum.]          XXI (A I, 16)    TO ATTICUS    ROME (MAY)      [Sidenote: B.C. 61, AET. 45]    You ask me what has happened about the trial, the result of which was so  contrary to the general expectation, and at the same time you want to  know how I came to make a worse fight of it than usual. I will answer  the last first, after the manner of Homer.[94] The fact is that, so long  as I had to defend the authority of the senate,[95] I battled with such  gallantry and vigour that there were shouts of applause and crowds round  me in the house ringing with my praise. Nay, if you ever thought that I  shewed courage in political business, you certainly would have admired  my conduct in that cause. For when the culprit had betaken himself to  public meetings, and had made an invidious use of my name, immortal  gods! What battles! What havoc! What sallies I made upon Piso, Curio, on  the whole of that set! How I fell upon the old men for their  instability, on the young for their profligacy! Again and again, so help  me heaven! I regretted your absence not only as the supporter of my  policy, but as the spectator also of my admirable fighting. However,  when Hortensius hit on the idea of a law as to the sacrilege being  proposed by the tribune Fufius, in which there was no difference from  the bill of the consul except as to the kind of jurymen--on that point,  however, the whole question turned--and got it carried by sheer  fighting, because he had persuaded himself and others that _he_ could  not get an acquittal no matter who were the jurymen, I drew in my sails,  seeing the neediness of the jurors, and gave no evidence beyond what was  so notorious and well attested that I could not omit it.[96] Therefore,  if you ask the reason of the acquittal--to return at length to the  former of the two questions--it was entirely the poverty and low  character of the jury. But that this was possible was entirely the  result of Hortensius's policy. In his alarm lest Fufius should veto the  law which was to be proposed in virtue of a senatorial decree, he failed  to see that it was better that the culprit should be left under a cloud  of disgrace and dishonour than that he should be trusted to the  discretion of a weak jury. But in his passionate resentment he hastened  to bring the case into court, saying that a leaden sword was good enough  to cut _his_ throat. But if you want to know the history of the trial,  with its incredible verdict, it was such that Hortensius's policy is now  blamed by other people after the event, though I disapproved of it from  the first. When the rejection of jurors had taken place, amidst loud  cheers and counter-cheers--the accuser like a strict censor rejecting  the most worthless, the defendant like a kind-hearted trainer of  gladiators all the best--as soon as the jury had taken their seats, the  loyalists at once began to feel distrust. There never was a seedier lot  round a table in a gambling hell. Senators under a cloud, equites out at  elbows, tribunes who were not so much made of money as \"collectors\" of  it, according to their official title.[97] However, there were a few  honest men in the panel, whom he had been unable to drive off it by  rejection, and they took their seats among their uncongenial comrades  with gloomy looks and signs of emotion, and were keenly disgusted at  having to rub elbows with such rascals.
