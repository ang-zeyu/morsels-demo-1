In this she made  such rapid progress that she soon lost all sense of disadvantage, and  conducted herself behind the counter very much as if she were back in  her old store in Polotzk. It was far more cozy than Polotzk--at least,  so it seemed to me; for behind the store was the kitchen, where, in the  intervals of slack trade, she did her cooking and washing. Arlington  Street customers were used to waiting while the storekeeper salted the  soup or rescued a loaf from the oven.    Once more Fortune favored my family with a thin little smile, and my  father, in reply to a friendly inquiry, would say, \"One makes a living,\"  with a shrug of the shoulders that added \"but nothing to boast of.\" It  was characteristic of my attitude toward bread-and-butter matters that  this contented me, and I felt free to devote myself to the conquest of  my new world. Looking back to those critical first years, I see myself  always behaving like a child let loose in a garden to play and dig and  chase the butterflies. Occasionally, indeed, I was stung by the wasp of  family trouble; but I knew a healing ointment--my faith in America. My  father had come to America to make a living. America, which was free and  fair and kind, must presently yield him what he sought. I had come to  America to see a new world, and I followed my own ends with the utmost  assiduity; only, as I ran out to explore, I would look back to see if my  house were in order behind me--if my family still kept its head above  water.    In after years, when I passed as an American among Americans, if I was  suddenly made aware of the past that lay forgotten,--if a letter from  Russia, or a paragraph in the newspaper, or a conversation overheard in  the street-car, suddenly reminded me of what I might have been,--I  thought it miracle enough that I, Mashke, the granddaughter of Raphael  the Russian, born to a humble destiny, should be at home in an American  metropolis, be free to fashion my own life, and should dream my dreams  in English phrases. But in the beginning my admiration was spent on more  concrete embodiments of the splendors of America; such as fine houses,  gay shops, electric engines and apparatus, public buildings,  illuminations, and parades. My early letters to my Russian friends were  filled with boastful descriptions of these glories of my new country. No  native citizen of Chelsea took such pride and delight in its  institutions as I did. It required no fife and drum corps, no Fourth of  July procession, to set me tingling with patriotism. Even the common  agents and instruments of municipal life, such as the letter carrier and  the fire engines, I regarded with a measure of respect. I know what I  thought of people who said that Chelsea was a very small, dull,  unaspiring town, with no discernible excuse for a separate name or  existence.    The apex of my civic pride and personal contentment was reached on the  bright September morning when I entered the public school. That day I  must always remember, even if I live to be so old that I cannot tell my  name. To most people their first day at school is a memorable occasion.  In my case the importance of the day was a hundred times magnified, on  account of the years I had waited, the road I had come, and the  conscious ambitions I entertained.    I am wearily aware that I am speaking in extreme figures, in  superlatives. I wish I knew some other way to render the mental life of  the immigrant child of reasoning age. I may have been ever so much an  exception in acuteness of observation, powers of comparison, and  abnormal self-consciousness; none the less were my thoughts and conduct  typical of the attitude of the intelligent immigrant child toward  American institutions. And what the child thinks and feels is a  reflection of the hopes, desires, purposes of the parent who brought him  overseas, no matter how precocious and independent the child may be.  Your immigrant inspectors will tell you what poverty the foreigner  brings in his baggage, what want in his pockets. Let the overgrown boy  of twelve, reverently drawing his letters in the baby class, testify to  the noble dreams and high ideals that may be hidden beneath the greasy  caftan of the immigrant. Speaking for the Jews, at least, I know I am  safe in inviting such an investigation.    Who were my companions on my first day at school? Whose hand was in  mine, as I stood, overcome with awe, by the teacher's desk, and  whispered my name as my father prompted? Was it Frieda's steady, capable  hand? Was it her loyal heart that throbbed, beat for beat with mine, as  it had done through all our childish adventures? Frieda's heart did  throb that day, but not with my emotions. My heart pulsed with joy and  pride and ambition; in her heart longing fought with abnegation. For I  was led to the schoolroom, with its sunshine and its singing and the  teacher's cheery smile; while she was led to the workshop, with its foul  air, care-lined faces, and the foreman's stern command. Our going to  school was the fulfilment of my father's best promises to us, and  Frieda's share in it was to fashion and fit the calico frocks in which  the baby sister and I made our first appearance in a public schoolroom.    I remember to this day the gray pattern of the calico, so affectionately  did I regard it as it hung upon the wall--my consecration robe awaiting  the beatific day. And Frieda, I am sure, remembers it, too, so  longingly did she regard it as the crisp, starchy breadths of it slid  between her fingers. But whatever were her longings, she said nothing of  them; she bent over the sewing-machine humming an Old-World melody. In  every straight, smooth seam, perhaps, she tucked away some lingering  impulse of childhood; but she matched the scrolls and flowers with the  utmost care. If a sudden shock of rebellion made her straighten up for  an instant, the next instant she was bending to adjust a ruffle to the  best advantage. And when the momentous day arrived, and the little  sister and I stood up to be arrayed, it was Frieda herself who patted  and smoothed my stiff new calico; who made me turn round and round, to  see that I was perfect; who stooped to pull out a disfiguring  basting-thread. If there was anything in her heart besides sisterly love  and pride and good-will, as we parted that morning, it was a sense of  loss and a woman's acquiescence in her fate; for we had been close  friends, and now our ways would lie apart. Longing she felt, but no  envy. She did not grudge me what she was denied. Until that morning we  had been children together, but now, at the fiat of her destiny she  became a woman, with all a woman's cares; whilst I, so little younger  than she, was bidden to dance at the May festival of untroubled  childhood.    I wish, for my comfort, that I could say that I had some notion of the  difference in our lots, some sense of the injustice to her, of the  indulgence to me. I wish I could even say that I gave serious thought to  the matter. There had always been a distinction between us rather out of  proportion to the difference in our years. Her good health and domestic  instincts had made it natural for her to become my mother's right hand,  in the years preceding the emigration, when there were no more servants  or dependents. Then there was the family tradition that Mary was the  quicker, the brighter of the two, and that hers could be no common lot.  Frieda was relied upon for help, and her sister for glory. And when I  failed as a milliner's apprentice, while Frieda made excellent progress  at the dressmaker's, our fates, indeed, were sealed. It was understood,  even before we reached Boston, that she would go to work and I to  school. In view of the family prejudices, it was the inevitable course.  No injustice was intended. My father sent us hand in hand to school,  before he had ever thought of America. If, in America, he had been able  to support his family unaided, it would have been the culmination of his  best hopes to see all his children at school, with equal advantages at  home. But when he had done his best, and was still unable to provide  even bread and shelter for us all, he was compelled to make us children  self-supporting as fast as it was practicable. There was no choosing  possible; Frieda was the oldest, the strongest, the best prepared, and  the only one who was of legal age to be put to work.    My father has nothing to answer for. He divided the world between his  children in accordance with the laws of the country and the compulsion  of his circumstances. I have no need of defending him. It is myself that  I would like to defend, and I cannot. I remember that I accepted the  arrangements made for my sister and me without much reflection, and  everything that was planned for my advantage I took as a matter of  course. I was no heartless monster, but a decidedly self-centered child.  If my sister had seemed unhappy it would have troubled me; but I am  ashamed to recall that I did not consider how little it was that  contented her. I was so preoccupied with my own happiness that I did not  half perceive the splendid devotion of her attitude towards me, the  sweetness of her joy in my good luck. She not only stood by approvingly  when I was helped to everything; she cheerfully waited on me herself.  And I took everything from her hand as if it were my due.    The two of us stood a moment in the doorway of the tenement house on  Arlington Street, that wonderful September morning when I first went to  school. It was I that ran away, on winged feet of joy and expectation;  it was she whose feet were bound in the tread-mill of daily toil. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17164"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#18)"],[1,"scene I have witnessed since leaving Tripoli. Mustapha brings  his staff and 200 Arab cavaliers with him, to relieve the Fezzan  irregulars. They make a gallant-looking body of men as they come swiftly  on. All the authorities of the town, with whatever cavalry is already  collected here, pour out of the gates to pay their compliments; and then  come crowds of the lower classes of citizens, with their rude bagpipes,  which scream discordantly. The horsemen galloped hither and thither in  the plain whilst the interview between the great men took place, and  effectually drowned all the polite things that were said by their  trampling and hurrahing. We rode up likewise to welcome the new great  man. Mustapha looked well, was excellently mounted, and dressed almost  like an European officer. He smiled graciously on seeing his old friend  of Ghadamez, and shook me by the hand; he also recognised the Germans,  having seen them at Zaweeah, near Tripoli. Satisfied with this little  interview, we drew aside, and the procession moved towards the gate.  There was instantly a rush of the Arab horsemen, every one trying to get  in front; and as the entry was narrow an obstruction soon took place. We  drew aside, and called out to those who were pressing on to make way for  the Governor. One fellow would not hear; and Mustapha himself riding up,  lashed him with a small whip across the shoulders. Bad taste; but  perhaps excusable in this case, if ever. These lawless soldiery can  never be taught good manners, without which true discipline is  impossible. However, we at length got within the gate, and the  procession poured along the streets, the women _loo-looing_ as we  passed, the bagpipes shrieking louder than ever, the crowd buzzing, the  horses thundering, the cavaliers shouting. In fine, this hubbub carried  us quite back into the regions of civilisation, where men collect on  public occasions often without any real joy, and by mere process of  action and reaction succeed in working themselves up into a state of  boisterous enthusiasm.    Several days were now chiefly occupied in writing reports on the  progress made by the expedition hitherto; and in voluminous  correspondence on petty, matters--petty, I mean, in themselves, but very  important to us--all connected with our future proceedings. I forwarded  to the Foreign Office a letter addressed by the Sultan Laoul, of the  Tibboos of Bilma, to Mr. Gagliuffi. It appears these people are now  nominally subject to the Ottoman Porte.    _12th._--We went to pay a visit to Mustapha Agha, my old friend of  Ghadamez. He received us with all the honours--a guard of officers,  pipes, coffee, and sherbet. That important subject of health was a good  deal talked of. Mustapha fears the climate of Fezzan, and finds little  consolation in the doctrines of fatalism. He seemed surprised at the  bulk of the despatches last forwarded from the Consulate, and asked if  we all knew how to write. He cannot understand the necessity of minute  directions. We explained as well as we could; and then talked of the  journeys we had respectively performed. This gave Mustapha an  opportunity of astonishing us in his Turkish way. He said that he had  come with 200 men and 300 camels from Tripoli in sixteen days, having  stopped only one day, and travelled regularly from three in the  afternoon to nine next morning. We marvelled, as in duty bound; but  refrained not from making inquiries; the result of which was, that the  real time was thirty-one days, only eight days less than we had  occupied. We did not scold Mustapha for his exaggeration, but might  perhaps have done so without offence. When a Turk does tell a lie, he  submits to be accused of it with good-humour.    After leaving the hyperbolical Governor, we went to see Sheikh Mohammed  Boro, Sakontaroua of Aghadez, who has arrived here _en route_ from  Mekka. He was recommended to us by Hassan Pasha of Tripoli; but Mr.  Gagliuffi does not think much of him. We shall see.    _14th._--Walked in the gardens, and were pleased with their aspect. On  returning, I wrote out the different kinds of dates in this country. We  saw some Egyptian camels with a pilgrim caravan, of a dark and almost  black colour.    My Fezzanee marabout, by the way, has left Mourzuk, after making me a  present of some cakes and dates of dainty quality. He has been of great  use to me, and I shall remember him with pleasure.    I had to-day a conversation with a Tibboo of Tibesty. How interesting it  is to talk with the natives of those untrodden countries, to which  chance may some day lead us! He says Tibesty is ten days from Gatroun,  and fourteen from Mourzuk. It is all mountainous, except one long wady  where the population is located. There is no regular town; but all along  the valley the population, which is said to be about 5000, though desert  statistics are little to be credited, is scattered in groups of three or  four, cultivating the ground and tending on the flocks which feed on the  rich herbage, whilst goats scramble for food along the slopes of the  boundary mountains. The people dwell either in huts or in caverns  scooped out of the sides of hills, some of them very extensive. What a  picture of primitive life! Families living separate, not yet driven to  hide behind walls, or congregate in masses for safety. The desert is  their bulwark. This place lies, indeed, far east of the caravan route  from Bornou. There is no road direct eastward from Tibesty, but caravans  can go south-east to Wadai. The valley produces, besides other grain, a  good quantity of ghaseb, which is the principal food of the inhabitants.  Some palms rise here and there in clumps, but are not very productive;  and dates are imported from Fezzan. The tree most frequent is the  tholukh; but there is also another common tree, called the arak. In the  open country, the wadan, the gazelle, and the ostrich are found, and the  people hunt them with dogs. Good water is supplied by wells and streams,  in sufficient quantities to irrigate the fields of ghaseb, wheat, and  barley. Rain is abundant some years, but fails in others; torrents are  continually descending from the mountains: one stream flows through a  space of two days' journey. If these accounts be correct, the country  must be one of the most interesting in Africa. They say, that on account  the height of the mountains some of the inhabitants do not see the moon  for fifteen days together. A Sultan rules paternally in this  out-of-the-way country, where the Mohammedan religion reigns paramount.  My informant made me pay three Tunisian piastres and two common  handkerchiefs for a vocabulary of the language of the Tibboos of  Tibesty. A visit to this singular oasis might repay a hardy traveller;  but the people of the country have a faithless character, and it would  be dangerous to trust to their promises of protection.    The Tibesty Tibboos must not be confounded with the Tibboos of the  salt-mines of Bilma, who have recently made their submission to the  Porte. There is little connexion between the people, although they speak  a similar language. The Bilma Tibboos lie in the direct route to Bornou,  and were fully studied by the Denham and Clapperton expedition.    _15th._--Continue to prepare papers to send home. Report the fact, that  the functionaries of Mourzuk trade in slaves.    _16th._--I had lent Mustapha a sword; but, after keeping it a night, he  was obliged to return it, sending word that a firman had been written to  all the functionaries of the Porte, forbidding them to receive any  presents,--an excellent measure, doing credit to the Sultan's  administration. The great plague of the East is the system of bribery  carried on under the form of presents. The pay of the Pasha is six  hundred and fifty mahboubs per month, nearly all spent in the town.    _17th._--The weather is extremely hot and sultry. The sun burns the  umbrella if you pass for a few minutes under it. Even the natives  complain of the extreme heat of the weather.    _18th._--Not quite so oppressive; but, as Dr. Barth says, the south wind  blows throughout Northern Africa in May.    _20th._--This morning, the black who came with us, and had two wives,  divorced one of them, returning the woman's dowry of thirty-seven  Tunisian piastres. The divorce took place before the Kady in the open  streets.    _21st._--Haj Lameen came to see me. He does not forget to remind us that  the Tuaricks expect many presents. I have no doubt they do. He says we  must be generous at all the following places:--Ghat, Aheer, Aghadez,  Damerghou, Zinder, Minyou, Tesaouah, Kashna, Kanou, Sakkatou, Bornou,  Begharmi, Mandara, and to the Tibboos of Bilma; not to mention the  intermediate towns and villages. However, if the presents be valuable,  we may expect in some places rations of food in return. It is worthy of  remark, that this said Haj Lameen, brother of the governor of Ghat, took  an oath during the past year that he would never again purchase slaves.  This is a remarkable instance of the progress of opinion. I afterwards  gave Lameen a present, consisting of one pound of tea, five pounds of  coffee, and four heads of loaf sugar. This was the first considerable  present I made. In the evening we observed Mercury in conjunction with  Venus. The heavens were unusually bright for Mourzuk. We saw also  Jupiter's satellites at seven in the evening. The two upper ones were  much nearer than the two lower ones to the great planet, but all in a  line. Mars was very bright. The rings, or extinct volcanoes of the moon,  were also truly transparent this evening. Usually the sky of Mourzuk is  charged with a dirty red haze, and not at all favourable to astronomical  observations.    _21st._--The culture of water-melons is progressing for the summer  season. The melons are planted in the irrigation ducts that lead to the  squares of clover, which is cultivated at this"]]]
