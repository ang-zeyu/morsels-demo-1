Students will find all that he knew of his instrument and everything he  did in his Le Stregghe (The Witches), the Rondo de la Clochette, and the  Carnaval de Venise, which have been handed down precisely as he left  them in manuscript.    Signora Calcagno, who at one time dazzled Italy by the boldness and  brilliancy of her violin playing, was his pupil when she was seven  years old. The only other person who could boast having direct  instructions from him was his young fellow townsman, Camillo Ernesto  Sivori (1815-1894), who was in his day a great celebrity in European  musical centres, and who was familiar to concert-goers in this country,  especially in Boston, during the late forties and early fifties. He was  thought to produce a small but electric tone, and to play invariably in  tune. To him his master willed his Stradivarius violin, besides having  given him in life the famous Vuillaume copy of his Guarnerius, a set of  manuscript violin studies and a high artistic ideal.    A scholarly teacher and composer for the violin was the German Ludwig  Spohr (1784-1859), who was born the same year as the wizard Paganini,  and who, although having less scintillant genius than the weird Italian,  is believed to have had a more beneficent influence over violin playing  in his treatment of the instrument. He set an example of purity of style  and roundness of tone, and raised the violin concerto to its present  dignity. His violin school is a standard work.    From the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present time the  lists of excellent violinists have rapidly increased and heights of  technical skill have been reached by many that would have dazzled early  violin masters. The special tendencies of gifted leaders have divided  players into defined schools. Among noted exponents of the French school  may be mentioned Alard and his pupil Sarasate, Dancla and Sauret.  Charles August de Beriot (1802-1870) was the actual founder of the  Belgian school whose famous members include the names of Vieuxtemps,  Leonard, Wieniawski, Thomson and Ysaye. Ferdinand David (1810-1873),  first head of the violin department at the Leipsic Conservatory, gave  impulse to the German school. Among his famous pupils are Dr. Joseph  Joachim, known as one of the musical giants of the nineteenth century;  August Wilhelmj, the favorite of Wagner, and Carl Gaertner, who, with  his violin has done so much to cultivate a taste for classical music in  Philadelphia. Among the many lady violinists who have attained a high  degree of excellence are Madame Norman Neruda, now Lady Halle, Teresina  Tua, Camilla Urso, Geraldine Morgan, Maud Powell and Leonora Jackson.    The only violinist whose memory was ever honored with public monuments  was Ole Bull (1810-1880), who has been called the Paganini of the North.  Two statues of him have been unveiled by his countrymen, one in his  native city, Bergen, Norway, and one in Minneapolis, Minnesota. These  tributes have been paid not so much to the violinist who swayed the  emotions of an audience and who could sing a melody on his instrument  into the hearts of his hearers, as to the patriot, the man who turned  the eyes of the world to his sturdy little fatherland, and who gave the  strongest impulse for everything it has accomplished in the past half  century in art and in literature. Another patriot violinist was the  Hungarian Eduard Remenyi (1830-1898), who first introduced Johannes  Brahms to Liszt, and should always be remembered as the discoverer of  Brahms.    The great demand of the day in the violin field, as in that of other  musical instruments, is for dazzling pyrotechnic feats. It has perhaps  reached its climax in the young Bohemian Jan Kubelik, whose playing has  been pronounced technically stupendous. In the mad rush for advanced  technique, the soul of music it is meant to convey is, alas, too often  forgotten.    [Illustration: JENNY LIND]          IX    Queens of Song      Our first queen of song was Vittoria Archilei, that Florentine lady of  noble birth who labored faithfully with the famous \"Academy\" to discover  the secret of the Greek drama. It was she who furthered the success of  the embryo operas of Emilio del Cavalieri, late in the sixteenth  century, and roused enthusiasm by her splendid interpretation for Jacopo  Peri's \"Eurydice,\" the first opera presented to the public. She was  called \"Euterpe\" by her Italian contemporaries because her superb voice,  artistic skill, musical fire and intelligence fitted her to be the muse  of music. Her memory has been too little honored.    When Lully was giving opera to France he secured the co-operation of  Marthe le Rochois, a gifted student of declamation and song at the  Paris Academie Royale de Musique, for whose establishment he had  obtained letters patent in 1672. So great was his confidence in her  judgment that he consulted her in all that pertained to his work. Her  greatest public triumph was in his \"Armide.\" This earliest French queen  of song is described as a brunette, with mediocre figure and plain face,  who had wonderful magnetism and sparkling black eyes that mirrored the  changeful sentiments of an impassioned soul. Her acting and  voice-control were pronounced remarkable. Her superior powers, unspoiled  simplicity, frankness and generosity are extolled by that quaint  historian of the opera, Dury de Noinville. On her retirement from the  stage, in 1697, the king awarded her a pension of 1,000 livres in token  of appreciation, and to this the Duc de Sully added 500 livres. She died  in Paris in the seventieth year of her age, her home having long been  the resort of eminent artists and literary people.    Katherine Tofts, who made her debut in Clayton's \"Arsinoe, Queen of  Cyprus,\" about 1702, was the first dramatic songstress of English birth,  and is described by Colley Cibber as a beautiful woman with a clear,  silvery-toned, flexible soprano. Her professional career brought her  fortune as well as fame, but was short-lived. In the height of her bloom  her reason gave way, and although judicious treatment restored it for a  time, she did not return to the stage. As the wife of Mr. Joseph Smith,  art connoisseur and collector of rare books and prints, she went to  Venice, where her husband was British Consul, and lived in much state  until, her malady returning, it became necessary to seclude her.  Wandering through the garden of her home she fancied herself the queen  of former days. Steele, in the \"Tattler,\" attributes her disorder to her  stage habit of absorbing herself in imaginary great personages.    While Mrs. Tofts reigned in Clayton's opera, Signora Francesca Margarita  de l'Epine, a native of Tuscany, sang Italian airs before and after it.  Tall, swarthy, brusque in manner, she had a voice and a style that made  her famous. It was she who inaugurated the custom of giving farewell  concerts. Meeting with brilliant success at a performance announced as  her last appearance, \"she continued,\" says Dr. Burney, \"to sing more  last and positively last times and never left England at all.\" There was  a rivalry between the two queens of song, which being a novelty,  furnished gossip and laughter for all London. Hughes, that \"agreeable  poet,\" wrote of it:        _\"Music has learned the discords of the State,      And concerts jar with Whig and Tory hate.\"_    Retiring in 1722 with a fortune of ten thousand pounds, Margarita  married the learned Dr. Pepusch, who was enabled by her means to pursue  with ease his scientific studies. In his library she found Queen  Elizabeth's Virginal Book, and being a skilled harpsichordist, she so  well mastered its intricacies that people thronged to her home to hear  her play.    London was divided by another pair of rival queens of song in 1725-6.  One of these, Francesca Cuzzoni, a native of Parma, had created such a  furore on her first appearance, three years earlier, that the opera  directors who had engaged her for the season at two thousand guineas  were encouraged to charge four guineas for admission, and her costumes  were adopted by fashionable youth and beauty. Although ugly and  ill-made, she had a sweet, clear dramatic contralto with unrivalled high  notes, intonations so fixed it seemed impossible for her to sing out of  tune, and a native flexibility that left unimpeded her creative fancy.  Handel, in whose operas she sang, composed airs calculated to display  her charms, but she, confident of her supremacy, rewarded him with  conduct so capricious that, finding her at last intolerable, he sent to  Italy for the noble Venetian lady, Faustina Bordoni. She was elegant in  figure, handsome of face, had an amiable disposition, a ringing  mezzo-soprano, with a compass from B-flat to G in altissimo, and was  renowned for her brilliant execution, distinct enunciation, beautiful  shake, happy memory for embellishments and fine expression.    However pleased the directors may have been at first to have two popular  songstresses, they were soon dismayed at the fierce rivalry that sprang  up between them and was fanned to flames by Master Handel himself, who  now composed exclusively for Faustina. By increasing the salary of her  more tractable rival they finally disposed of Cuzzoni, who thenceforth  through her exaggerated demands, managed to disgust her patrons wherever  she appeared. Her reckless extravagance left her wholly destitute after  losing her voice and her husband, Signor Sandoni, a harpsichord-maker.  She passed her last years in Bologna, subsisting on a miserable pittance  earned by covering buttons.    Faustina married Adolphe Hasse, the German dramatic composer, and at  forty-seven sang before Frederick the Great, who was charmed with the  freshness of her voice. The couple lived until 1783, the one  eighty-three, the other eighty-four years of age. Dr. Burney visited  them when they were advanced in the seventies and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#18)"],[1,"her  indignation. I am now only anxious for Sagarika. Her form, as delicate  as the petal of the lotus, dissolving in the breath of inexperienced  passion, has found a passage through the channels by which love  penetrates, and is lodged deep in my heart. The friend to whom I could  confide my secret sorrows is the prisoner of the queen.\" Vasantaka now  informs the king that he has been restored to liberty. Asked about  Sagarika he hangs down his head and declares that he cannot utter such  unpleasant tidings. The king infers that Sagarika is no more and faints.  The friend says, \"my friend, revive--revive! I was about to tell you,  the queen has sent her to Ougein--this I called unpleasant tidings,  Susangata told me so,--and what is more, she gave me this necklace to  bring to your Majesty.\" Vasantaka gives the king the necklace which he  applies to his heart to alleviate his despair. By command, the courtier  applies the ornament round the neck of the king. At this time,  Vijayavarman, the nephew of Rumanwat the general of the state, arrives  to announce:--\"Glory to your Majesty! your Majesty's fortune is  propitious in the triumphs of Rumanwat. By your Majesty's auspices the  _Kosalas_ are subdued. On receiving your Majesty's commands, my uncle  soon collected a mighty army of foot, and horse, and elephants, and  marching against the king of Kosala, surrounded him in a strong position  in the Vindhya mountains. Impatient of the blockade, the _Kosala_  monarch prepared his troops for an engagement. Issuing from the heights,  the enemy's forces came down upon us in great numbers, and the points of  the horizon were crowded with the array of mighty elephants, like  another chain of mountains: they bore down our infantry beneath their  ponderous masses: those who escaped the shock were transpierced by  innumerable arrows and the enemy flattered himself he had for once  disappointed our commander's hopes. Fires flashed from the blows of  contending heroes, helmets and heads were cloven in twain--the broken  armour and scattered weapons were carried away in torrents of blood, and  the defiance of the king of _Kosala_, in the van of his army, was heard  by our warriors; when our chief alone confronted him, and slew the  monarch on his furious elephant with countless shafts. All honour to our  gallant foe, the king of _Kosala_; for glorious is the warrior's death  when his enemies applaud his prowess. Rumanwat then appointed my elder  brother, Sanjayavarman, to govern the country of _Kosala_, and making  slow marches in consequence of the number of his wounded, returned to  the capital. He is now arrived.\" The king applauds his general and  commands the distribution of the treasures of his favour.    Samvarasiddhi, a magician from Ougein, now interviews the king. The  magician, waving a bunch of peacock's feathers, observes, \"Reverence to  Indra, who lends our art his name. What are your Majesty's commands?  Would you see the moon brought down upon earth, a mountain in mid air, a  fire in the ocean, or night at noon? I will produce them--Command. What  need of many words? By the force of my master's spells, I will place  before your eyes the person whom in your heart you are most anxious to  behold.\"    The king not wishing to see the performance alone, summons the queen who  arrives soon. The king leads her to a seat, sits beside her and commands  the magician to display his power.    The magician waves his plumes and exhibits most wonderful scenes.  _Brahma_ appears throned upon the lotus; _Sankara_ appears with the  crescent moon, his glittering crest; _Hari_, the destroyer of the demon  race, in whose four hands the bow, the sword, the mace and the shell are  borne, is observable. _Indra_, the king of _Swarga_, is seen mounted on  his stately elephant. Around them countless spirits dance merrily in mid  air, sporting with the lovely nymphs of heaven, whose anklets ring  responsive to the measure. The king and queen look up and rise from  their seats. At this time, a female attendant appears to announce;--\"So  please your Majesty, the minister Yaugandharayana begs to inform you,  that Vikrambahu, the king of Ceylon, has sent, along with your own  messenger who returns, the councillor Vasubhuti; be pleased to receive  him as the season is auspicious. The minister will also wait upon you as  soon as he is at leisure.\" The queen observes, \"Suspend this spectacle,  my lord. Vasubhuti is a man of elevated rank; he is also of the family  of my maternal uncle, and should not be suffered to wait; let us first  see him.\" The king orders the suspension of the show, the magician  retires promising to exhibit yet some sights.    Vasubhuti, after the customary exchange of courtesies, thus relates his  story:--\"In consequence of the prophesy of a seer, that whoever should  wed Ratnavali, my master's daughter, should become the emperor in the  world, your Majesty's minister solicited her for your bride; unwilling,  however, to be instrumental in the uneasiness of Vasavadatta, the king  of Simhala declined compliance with his suit. My master, understanding  at last that the queen was deceased, consented to give his daughter to  you. We were deputed to conduct her hither, when alas, our vessel was  wrecked.\" The envoy, overpowered by sorrows, is unable to continue the  story and weeps. The queen exclaims, \"Alas, unhappy that I am! Loved  sister Ratnavali, where art thou? Near me and reply.\"    The king consoles the queen thus:--    \"The fate that causes, may remove our sorrows.\"    A cry is now heard from behind that the inner apartments are on fire.  The king starts up wildly and exclaims, \"Vasavadatta burnt to death! my  queen, my love!\"    The queen exclaims, \"What extravagance is this--behold me at your side.  But ah! help, help, my lord. I think not of myself but poor Sagarika.  She is in bonds; my cruelty has kept her captive--and she will be lost  without some aid--haste, haste and save her!\" The king flies to her  rescue, precipitates himself into the flames and takes her in his arms.  He pauses--looks around--closes his eyes, and reopens them. The flames  disappear. The palace stands unharmed. The king observes, \"This must  have been a dream, or is it magic?\" Vasantaka replies, \"The latter, no  doubt; did not that conjuring son of a slave say, he had still something  for your Majesty to see?\"    The king says to the queen,    \"Here, madam, is Sagarika rescued in obedience to your commands.\" The  queen smiling replies, \"I am sensible of your obedience, my lord.\" She  now informs all present, \"Yaugandharayana presented her to me, and told  me she had been rescued from the sea: it was hence we designated her  Sagarika or the ocean Maid.\" The likeness--the necklace--the recovery of  the damsel from the sea--leave no doubt in the mind of Vasubhuti that  this is the daughter of the king of Simhala, Ratnavali. Vasubhuti  advances to her who looks at him. They recognize each other and both  faint. After some time they recover. As Ratnavali goes to embrace the  queen at her invitation, she stumbles. At the request of the queen who  blushes for her cruelty, the king takes the chains off Ratnavali's feet.  Yaugandharayana now explains his conduct thus, \"It was formerly  announced to us by a holy seer, that the husband of the princess of  Simhala should become the emperor of the world. We therefore earnestly  applied to her father to give her hand to our sovereign; but unwilling  to be cause of uneasiness to the queen, the monarch of Simhala declined  compliance with our request: we therefore raised a report that  Vasavadatta had perished by a fire at Lavanaka, and Babhravya was  despatched with the news to the court of Simhala. Vikrambahu then  consented to our proposal and sent his daughter on board a ship  accompanied by Vasubhuti and Babhravya. The ship was wrecked. The  princess was rescued from the sea by a merchant who brought her to me. I  placed her with the queen in a very unsuitable station as I expected you  would see her in the inner apartments, and take pleasure in her sight. I  had some concern in the appearance of the magician who had conjured up a  vision of the gods and a conflagration, as no other means remained of  restoring the damsel to your presence and creating an opportunity for  Vasubhuti to see and recognise the princess.\" The queen now puts on  Ratnavali her own jewels, then takes her by the hand and presents her to  the king. Ratnavali bows to the queen who embraces her. The king  observes, \"My cares are all rewarded. Nothing more is necessary,  Vikrambahu is my kinsman, Sagarika, the essence of the world, the source  of universal victory, is mine, and Vasavadatta rejoices to obtain a  sister. The _Kosalas_ are subdued: what other object does the world  present for which I could entertain a wish? This be alone my prayer; may  Indra with seasonable showers render the earth bountiful of grain; may  the presiding Brahmans secure the favour of the gods by acceptable  sacrifices; may the association of the pious confer delight until the  end of time, and may the appalling blasphemies of the profane be  silenced for ever.\"          APPENDIX.      THE VALUE OF DRAMA.    The purposes for which an ancient language may be studied are its  philology and its literature, or the arts and sciences, the notions and  manners, the history and beliefs of the people by whom it was spoken.  Particular branches may be preferably cultivated for the understanding  of each of these subjects, but there is no one species which will be  found to embrace so many purposes as the dramatic. The dialogue varies  from simple to elaborate, from the conversation of ordinary life to the  highest refinements of poetical taste. The illustrations are drawn from  every known product of art, as well as every observable phenomenon of  nature. The manners and feelings of the people are delineated, living  and breathing before us, and history "]]]
