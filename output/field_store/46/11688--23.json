Life was unquenchably wild and strong in that stallion; it  showed in the terror which made him hideous. And man and beast somehow  resembled each other in that moment which was inimical to noble life.    The avalanche slipped with little jerks, as if treacherously loosing  its hold for a long plunge. The line of fire below ate at the bleached  grass and the long column of smoke curled away on the wind.    Slone held the taut lasso with his left hand, and with the right he  swung the other rope, catching the noose round Wildfire's nose. Then  letting go of the first rope he hauled on the other, pulling the head  of the stallion far down. Hand over hand Slone closed in on the horse.  He leaped on Wildfire's head, pressed it down, and, holding it down on  the sand with his knees, with swift fingers he tied the noose in a  hackamore--an improvised halter. Then, just as swiftly, he bound his  scarf tight round Wildfire's head, blindfolding him.    \"All so easy!\" exclaimed Slone, under his breath. \"Lord! who would  believe it! ... Is it a dream?\"    He rose and let the stallion have a free head.    \"Wildfire, I got a rope on you--an' a hackamore--an' a blinder,\" said  Slone. \"An' if I had a bridle I'd put that on you.... Who'd ever  believe you'd catch yourself, draggin' in the sand?\"    Slone, finding himself failing on the sand, grew alive to the augmented  movement of the avalanche. It had begun to slide, to heave and bulge  and crack. Dust rose in clouds from all around. The sand appeared to  open and let him sink to his knees. The rattle of gravel was drowned in  a soft roar. Then he shot down swiftly, holding the lassoes, keeping  himself erect, and riding as if in a boat. He felt the successive steps  of the slope, and then the long incline below, and then the checking  and rising and spreading of the avalanche as it slowed down on the  level. All movement then was checked violently. He appeared to be half  buried in sand. While he struggled to extricate himself the thick dust  blew away and settled so that he could see. Wildfire lay before him, at  the edge of the slide, and now he was not so deeply embedded as he had  been up on the slope. He was struggling and probably soon would have  been able to get out. The line of fire was close now, but Slone did not  fear that.    At his shrill whistle Nagger bounded toward him, obedient, but  snorting, with ears laid back. He halted. A second whistle started him  again. Slone finally dug himself out of the sand, pulled the lassoes  out, and ran the length of them toward Nagger. The black showed both  fear and fight. His eyes roiled and he half shied away.    \"Come on!\" called Slone, harshly.    He got a hand on the horse, pulled him round, and, mounting in a flash,  wound both lassoes round the pommel of the saddle.    \"Haul him out, Nagger, old boy!\" cried Slone, and he dug spurs into the  black.    One plunge of Nagger's slid the stallion out of the sand. Snorting,  wild, blinded, Wildfire got up, shaking in every limb. He could not see  his enemies. The blowing smoke, right in his nose, made scent  impossible. But in the taut lassoes he sensed the direction of his  captors. He plunged, rearing at the end of the plunge, and struck out  viciously with his hoofs. Slone, quick with spur and bridle, swerved  Nagger aside and Wildfire, off his balance, went down with a crash.  Slone dragged him, stretched him out, pulled him over twice before he  got forefeet planted. Once up, he reared again, screeching his rage,  striking wildly with his hoofs. Slone wheeled aside and toppled him  over again.    \"Wildfire, it's no fair fight,\" he called, grimly. \"But you led me a  chase.... An' you learn right now I'm boss!\"    Again he dragged the stallion. He was ruthless. He would have to be so,  stopping just short of maiming or killing the horse, else he would  never break him. But Wildfire was nimble. He got to his feet and this  time he lunged out. Nagger, powerful as he was, could not sustain the  tremendous shock, and went down. Slone saved himself with a rider's  supple skill, falling clear of the horse, and he leaped again into the  saddle as Nagger pounded up. Nagger braced his huge frame and held the  plunging stallion. But the saddle slipped a little, the cinches  cracked. Slone eased the strain by wheeling after Wildfire.    The horses had worked away from the fire, and Wildfire, free of the  stifling smoke, began to break and lunge and pitch, plunging round  Nagger in a circle, running blindly, but with unerring scent. Slone, by  masterly horsemanship, easily avoided the rushes, and made a pivot of  Nagger, round which the wild horse dashed in his frenzy. It seemed that  he no longer tried to free himself. He lunged to kill.    \"Steady, Nagger, old boy!\" Slone kept calling. \"He'll never get at  you.... If he slips that blinder I'll kill him!\"    The stallion was a fiend in his fury, quicker than a panther, wonderful  on his feet, and powerful as an ox. But he was at a disadvantage. He  could not see. And Slone, in his spoken intention to kill Wildfire  should the scarf slip, acknowledged that he never would have a chance  to master the stallion. Wildfire was bigger, faster, stronger than  Slone had believed, and as for spirit, that was a grand and fearful  thing to see.    The soft sand in the pass was plowed deep before Wildfire paused in his  mad plunges. He was wet and heaving. His red coat seemed to blaze. His  mane stood up and his ears lay flat.    Slone uncoiled the lassoes from the pommel and slacked them a little.  Wildfire stood up, striking at the air, snorting fiercely. Slone tried  to wheel Nagger in close behind the stallion. Both horse and man  narrowly escaped the vicious hoofs. But Slone had closed in. He took a  desperate chance and spurred Nagger in a single leap as Wildfire reared  again. The horses collided. Slone hauled the lassoes tight. The impact  threw Wildfire off his balance, just as Slone had calculated, and as  the stallion plunged down on four feet Slone spurred Nagger close  against him. Wildfire was a little in the lead. He could only half rear  now, for the heaving, moving Nagger, always against him, jostled him  down, and Slone's iron arm hauled on the short ropes. When Wildfire  turned to bite, Slone knocked the vicious nose back with a long swing  of his fist.    Up the pass the horses plunged. With a rider's wild joy Slone saw the  long green-and-gray valley, and the isolated monuments in the distance.  There, on that wide stretch, he would break Wildfire. How marvelously  luck had favored him at the last!    \"Run, you red devil!\" Slone called. \"Drag us around now till you're  done!\"    They left the pass and swept out upon the waste of sage. Slone  realized, from the stinging of the sweet wind in his face, that Nagger  was being pulled along at a tremendous pace. The faithful black could  never have made the wind cut so. Lower the wild stallion stretched and  swifter he ran, till it seemed to Slone that death must end that  thunderbolt race.        CHAPTER VIII    Lucy Bostil had called twice to her father and he had not answered. He  was out at the hitching-rail, with Holley, the rider, and two other  men. If he heard Lucy he gave no sign of it. She had on her chaps and  did not care to go any farther than the door where she stood.    \"Somers has gone to Durango an' Shugrue is out huntin' hosses,\" Lucy  heard Bostil say, gruffly.    \"Wal now, I reckon I could handle the boat an' fetch Creech's hosses  over,\" said Holley.    Bostil raised an impatient hand, as if to wave aside Holley's  assumption.    Then one of the other two men spoke up. Lucy had seen him before, but  did not know his name.    \"Sure there ain't any need to rustle the job. The river hain't showed  any signs of risin' yet. But Creech is worryin'. He allus is worryin'  over them hosses. No wonder! Thet Blue Roan is sure a hoss. Yesterday  at two miles he showed Creech he was a sight faster than last year. The  grass is gone over there. Creech is grainin' his stock these last few  days. An' thet's expensive.\"    \"How about the flat up the canyon?\" queried Bostil. \"Ain't there any  grass there?\"    \"Reckon not. It's the dryest spell Creech ever had,\" replied the other.  \"An' if there was grass it wouldn't do him no good. A landslide blocked  the only trail up.\"    \"Bostil, them hosses, the racers special, ought to be brought acrost  the river,\" said Holley, earnestly. He loved horses and was thinking of  them.    \"The boat's got to be patched up,\" replied Bostil, shortly.    It occurred to Lucy that her father was also thinking of Creech's  thoroughbreds, but not like Holley. She grew grave and listened  intently.    There was an awkward pause. Creech's rider, whoever he was, evidently  tried to conceal his anxiety. He flicked his boots with a quirt. The  boots were covered with wet mud. Probably he had crossed the river very  recently.    \"Wal, when will you have the hosses fetched over?\" he asked,  deliberately. \"Creech'll want to know.\"    \"Just as soon as the boat's mended,\" replied Bostil. \"I'll put Shugrue  on the job to-morrow.\"    \"Thanks, Bostil. Sure, thet'll be all right. Creech'll be satisfied,\"  said the rider, as if relieved. Then he mounted, and with his companion  trotted down the lane.    The lean, gray Holley bent a keen gaze upon Bostil. But Bostil did not  notice that; he appeared preoccupied in thought.    \"Bostil, the dry winter an' spring here ain't any guarantee thet there  wasn't a lot of snow up in the mountains.\" Holley's remark startled  Bostil.    \"No--it ain't--sure,\" he replied.    \"An' any mornin' along now we might wake up to hear the Colorado  boomin',\" went on Holley, significantly.    Bostil did not reply to that.    \"Creech hain't lived over there so many years. What's he know about the  river? An' fer that matter, who knows anythin' sure about thet  hell-bent river?\"    \"It ain't my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#18)"],[1,"a guide,  who would be the interpreter of the will of Allah.    We here make a slight digression to show that this feeling extends beyond  the Shia'h sect, and is of some importance in its bearing upon the Eastern  Question. Apart from the superhuman claims for the Imam, what he is as a  ruler to the Shia'h, the Khalif is to the Sunni--the supreme head in Church  and State, the successor of the Prophet, the Conservator of Islam as made  known in the Quran, the Sunnat and the Ijma' of the early Mujtahidin. To  administer the laws, the administrator must have a divine sanction. Thus  when the Ottoman ruler, Selim the First, conquered Egypt, (A.D. 1516) he  sought and obtained, from an old descendant of the Baghdad Khalifs, the  transfer of the title to himself, and in this way the Sultans of Turkey  became the Khalifs of Islam. Whether Mutawakal Billal, the last titular  Khalif of the house of 'Abbas, was right or wrong in thus transferring the  title is not my purpose now to discuss. I only adduce the fact to show how  it illustrates the feeling of the need of a Pontiff--a divinely appointed  Ruler. Strictly speaking, according to Muhammadan law, the Sultans are not  Khalifs, for it is clearly laid down in the Traditions that the Khalif (or  the Imam) must be of the tribe of the Quraish, to which the Prophet himself  belonged.    Ibn-i-Umr relates that the Prophet said:--\"The Khalifs shall be in the  Quraish tribe as long as there are two {86} persons in it, one to rule and  another to serve.\"[77] \"It is a necessary condition that the Khalif should  be of the Quraish tribe.\"[78] Such quotations might be multiplied, and they  tend to show that it is not at all incumbent on orthodox Sunnis, other than  the Turks, to rush to the rescue of the Sultan, whilst to the Shia'hs he is  little better than a heretic. Certainly they would never look upon him as  an Imam, which personage is to them in the place of a Khalif. In countries  not under Turkish rule, the Khutbah, or prayer for the ruler, said on  Fridays in the mosques, is said for the \"ruler of the age,\" or for the  Amir, or whatever happens to be the title of the head of the State. Of late  years it has become more common in India to say it for the Sultan. This is  not, strictly speaking, according to Muhammadan law, which declares that  the Khutbah can only be said with the permission of the ruler, and as in  India that ruler is the British Government, the prayers should be said for  the Queen. Evidently the law never contemplated large bodies of Musalmans  residing anywhere but where the influence of the Khalif extended.    In thus casting doubt on the legality of the claim made by Turkish Sultans  to the Khalifate of Islam, I do not deny that the Law of Islam requires  that there should be a Khalif. Unfortunately for Islam, there is nothing in  its history parallel to the conflict of Pope and Emperor, of Church and  State. \"The action and re-action of these powerful and partially  independent forces, their resistance to each other, and their ministry to  each other, have been of incalculable value to the higher activity and life  of Christendom.\" In Islam the Khalif is both Pope and Emperor. Ibn Khaldoun  states that the difference between the Khalif and any other ruler is that  the former rules according to divine, the latter according to human law.  The Prophet in transmitting his sacred authority to the Khalifs, his  successors, conveyed to {87} them absolute powers. Khalifs can be  assassinated, murdered, banished, but so long as they reign anything like  constitutional liberty is impossible. It is a fatal mistake in European  politics and an evil for Turkey to recognize the Sultan as the Khalif of  Islam, for, if he be such, Turkey can never take any step forward to  newness of political life.[79]    This, however, is a digression from the subject of this chapter.    There has been from the earliest ages of Islam a movement which exists to  this day. It is a kind of mysticism, known as Sufiism. It has been  especially prevalent among the Persians. It is a re-action from the burden  of a rigid law, and a wearisome ritual. It has now existed for a thousand  years, and if it has the element of progress in it, if it is the salt of  Islam some fruit should now be seen. But what is Sufiism? The term Sufi is  most probably derived from the Arabic word Suf, \"wool,\" of which material  the garments worn by Eastern ascetics used to be generally made. Some  persons, however, derive it from the Persian, Suf, \"pure,\" or the Greek  [Greek: sophia], \"wisdom.\" Tasawwuf, or Sufiism, is the abstract form of  the word, and is, according to Sir W. Jones, and other learned  orientalists, a figurative mode, borrowed mainly from the Indian  philosophers of the Vedanta school, of expressing the fervour of devotion.  The chief idea is that the souls of men differ in degree, but not {88} in  kind, from the Divine Spirit, of which they are emanations, and to which  they will ultimately return. The Spirit of God is in all He has made, and  it in Him. He alone is perfect love, beauty, etc.--hence love to him is the  only _real_ thing; all else is illusion. Sa'di says: \"I swear by the truth  of God, that when He showed me His glory all else was illusion.\" This  present life is one of separation from the beloved. The beauties of nature,  music, and art revive in men the divine idea, and recall their affections  from wandering from Him to other objects. These sublime affections men must  cherish, and by abstraction concentrate their thoughts on God, and so  approximate to His essence, and finally reach the highest stage of  bliss--absorption into the Eternal. The true end and object of human life  is to lose all consciousness of individual existence--to sink \"in the ocean  of Divine Life, as a breaking bubble is merged into the stream on the  surface of which it has for a moment risen.\"[80]    Sufis, who all accept Islam as a divinely established religion, suppose  that long before the creation of the world a contract was made by the  Supreme Soul with the assembled world of spirits, who are parts of it. Each  spirit was addressed separately, thus: \"Art thou not with thy Lord?\" that  is, bound to him by a solemn contract. To this they all answered with one  voice, \"Yes.\"    Another account says that the seed of theosophy (m'arifat) was placed in  the ground in the time of Adam; that the plant {89} came forth in the days  of Noah, was in flower when Abraham was alive and produced fruit before  Moses passed away. The grapes of this noble plant were ripe in the time of  Jesus, but it was not till the age of Muhammad that pure wine was made from  them. Then those intoxicated with it, having attained to the highest degree  of the knowledge of God, could forget their own personality and  say:--\"Praise to me, is there any greater than myself? I am the Truth.\"    The following verse of the Quran is quoted by Sufis in support of their  favourite dogma--the attaining to the knowledge of God: \"When God said to  the angels, 'I am about to place a viceregent on the earth,' they said:  'Wilt Thou place therein one who shall commit abomination and shed blood?  Nay; we celebrate Thy praise and holiness.' God answered them, 'Verily I  know that ye wot not of.'\" (Sura ii. 28.) It is said that this verse proves  that, though the great mass of mankind would commit abomination, some would  receive the divine light and attain to a knowledge of God. A Tradition  states that David said: \"'Oh Lord! why hast Thou created mankind?' God  replied, 'I am a hidden treasure, and I would fain become known.'\" The  business of the mystic is to find this treasure, to attain to the Divine  light and the true knowledge of God.    The earlier Muhammadan mystics sought to impart life to a rigid and formal  ritual, and though the seeds of Pantheism were planted in their system from  the first, they maintained that they were orthodox. \"Our system of  doctrine,\" says Al-Junaid, \"is firmly bound up with the dogmas of the  faith, the Quran and the Traditions.\" There was a moral earnestness about  many of these men which frequently restrained the arm of unrighteous power,  and their sayings, often full of beauty, show that they had the power of  appreciating the spiritual side of life. Some of these sentences are worthy  of any age. \"As neither meat nor drink,\" says one, \"profit the diseased  body, so no warning avails {90} to touch the heart full of the love of this  world.\" \"The work of a holy man doth not consist in this, that he eats  grain, and clothes himself in wool, but in the knowledge of God and  submission to His will.\" \"Thou deservest not the name of a learned man till  thy heart is emptied of the love of this world.\" \"Hide thy good deeds as  closely as thou wouldst hide thy sins.\" A famous mystic was brought into  the presence of the Khalif Harun-ur-Rashid who said to him: \"How great is  thy abnegation?\" He replied, \"Thine is greater.\" \"How so?\" said the Khalif.  \"Because I make abnegation of this world, and thou makest abnegation of the  next.\" The same man also said: \"The display of devotional works to please  men is hypocrisy, and acts of devotion done to please men are acts of  polytheism.\"    But towards the close of the second century of the Hijra, this earlier  mysticism developed into Sufiism. Then Al-Hallaj taught in Baghdad thus: \"I  am the Truth. There is nought in Paradise but God. I am He whom I love, and  He whom I love is I; we are two souls dwelling in one body. When thou seest  me, thou seest Him; and when thou seest Him thou seest me.\" This roused the  opposition of the orthodox divines by whom Al-Hallaj was condemned to be  worthy of death. He was then by order of the Khalif flogged, tortured and  finally beheaded. Thus died one of the early martyrs of Sufiism, but it  grew in spite of bitter persecution.    In order to understand the esoteric teaching of Sufiistic poetry, it is  necessary"]]]
