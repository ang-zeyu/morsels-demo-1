It is best kept in the shape of foil. When  the purer metal is required, gold should be dissolved in aqua regia, the  solution evaporated to a paste, diluted, allowed to stand, and filtered.  The filtered solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid, warmed, and  precipitated with sodium sulphite. The precipitate is collected, washed,  and fused on charcoal.    ~Iron~, Fe.--The soft wire (thin) is used for standardising. Rods are  used in dry assays as a desulphurising agent. Steel must not be used,  since it is not pure, and contains a variable amount of iron.    ~Lead~, Pb.--Granulated lead or lead-foil is used in the dry assay for  silver and gold, and in the preparation of lead salts. It can be  obtained very pure, but always contains more or less silver, 1 or 2  milligrams in 100 grams. The amount of silver it contains must be  determined and recorded.    ~Lead Acetate~ (Pb[=A=c]_{2}.3H_{2}O, or  Pb(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}.3H_{2}O) is used as a test, specially for the  detection and estimation of sulphuretted hydrogen. Prepare a 10 per  cent. solution for use.    ~Lead Nitrate~ (Pb(NO_{3})_{2}) can be purchased pure. It is used for  standardising.    ~Lead Dioxide~ (PbO_{2}) occurs as a dark-brown powder. It is used as an  oxidizing agent and for absorbing sulphurous oxide. It can be prepared  by digesting red lead with warm dilute nitric acid; washing and drying  the residue.    \"~Litharge~,\" PbO.--It can be purchased as a yellow heavy powder. It is  used in dry assaying as a flux, as a desulphurising agent, and also as a  source of lead. It always contains some silver, the amount of which must  be determined.    ~Litmus.~--This is an organic colouring matter which is turned red by  acids and blue by alkalies. For ordinary purposes it is best used as  litmus paper, which may be purchased in small books. A solution is  prepared by digesting 15 or 20 grams of the commercial litmus in 100  c.c. of water on the water bath. After being allowed to settle, it is  filtered and made just faintly red with acetic acid. Then there is  added a drop or two of a solution of soda and 10 c.c. of alcohol. It  should be kept in a loosely-covered bottle.    ~Magnesia~, MgO.--It may be purchased as \"calcined magnesia.\" It is used  for making \"magnesia mixture,\" and should be kept in a corked  wide-mouthed bottle.    \"~Magnesia Mixture.~\"--Dissolve 22 grams of magnesia in about a quarter  of a litre of dilute hydrochloric acid, avoiding excess. Add 5 grams of  magnesia, boil, and filter. Add 300 grams of ammonic chloride, and 250  c.c. of strong ammonia; and dilute with water to 2 litres. It should be  kept in a stoppered winchester.    ~Magnesium Sulphate~, MgSO_{4}.7H_{2}O.--It can be purchased very pure,  and is occasionally used as a standard salt.    ~Manganese Dioxide~, MnO_{2}.--It is used in the preparation of  chlorine. The commercial article is not pure, but is sufficiently so for  this purpose.    ~Marble~, CaCO_{3}.--Fragments of the white crystalline variety only  should be used. It is used as a source of lime and of carbon dioxide.    ~Mercury~, Hg.--This can be purchased pure. It should have a bright  surface, flow without a tail, and leave no residue on ignition. It is  used as a standard; for amalgamation; and as a confining liquid in gas  analysis.    ~Mercuric Chloride~ (HgCl_{2}) may be purchased pure. Make a 5 per cent.  solution in water. It is used for destroying an excess of stannous  chloride; for removing sulphuretted hydrogen from solution; and as a  test for stannous salts.    ~Microcosmic Salt~, HAmNaPO_{4}.8H_{2}O.--When fused NaPO_{3} is formed.  It is used in testing for metallic oxides and silica before the  blowpipe. The crystals are sometimes used as a standard for phosphoric  acid.    \"~Nessler's Solution.~\"--Mode of preparation: Dissolve 35 grams of  potassium iodide in 100 c.c. of water; dissolve 17 grams of mercuric  chloride in 300 c.c. of water, and pour this solution into that of the  iodide till a permanent precipitate is produced; make up to 1 litre with  a 20 per cent. solution of potash; add mercuric chloride till a  precipitate is again formed; allow to settle and decant. It is used for  detecting ammonia.    ~Nitre.~--This is potassium nitrate.    ~Platinum Chloride~, 2HCl.PtCl_{4}. (In the crystallised form it has  6H_{2}O).--It may be made as follows:--Take 5 grams of clean platinum  scrap and dissolve in a flask at a gentle heat in 50 c.c. of  hydrochloric acid with the occasional addition of some nitric acid;  evaporate to a paste; and then dissolve in 100 c.c. of water. It is used  for separating and determining potassium.    ~Phenolphthalein~ is an organic compound used as an indicator; more  especially in determining the weaker acids, it cannot be used in the  presence of ammonia. Dissolve half a gram in 100 c.c. of dilute alcohol.    ~Potassium Bicarbonate~, KHCO_{3}.--It may be purchased pure; on  ignition it leaves the carbonate, K_{2}CO_{3}, which may be used as a  standard.    ~Potassium Cyanide~, KCN.--It is used in the dry assay as a reducing  agent. The commercial salt is very impure. Purchase that sold as  potassic cyanide (gold) which contains about 95 per cent. of KCN. It is  used for copper assaying and occasionally in separation. Make a 10 per  cent. solution when wanted.    ~Potassium Bichromate~, K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}. It may be purchased nearly  pure. It is used as an oxidising agent, for determining iron; and as a  test solution. For this last purpose a 10 per cent. solution is  prepared.    ~Potassium Chlorate~ (KClO_{3}) can be purchased pure. It is used with  hydrochloric acid as a substitute for aqua regia.    ~Potassium Ferrocyanide~ (K_{4}Fe(CN)_{6}.3H_{2}O), or \"yellow prussiate  of potash,\" is used as a test; as an indicator; and for the  determination of zinc. Make a 5 per cent. solution.    ~Potassium Ferricyanide~ (K_{6}Fe_{2}(CN)_{12}), or \"red prussiate of  potash,\" is used for testing; and as an indicator. Make a 5 per cent.  solution when wanted, as it decomposes on keeping.    ~Potassium Hydrate~, KHO. Purchase that purified with alcohol. It is an  alkali, and is used for absorbing carbonic acid, &c.    ~Potassium Iodide~, KI. It may be purchased nearly pure. It is used as a  test and for dissolving iodine. It should be used in a 10 per cent.  solution freshly made. The solution decomposes on exposure to light,  with separation of iodine.    ~Potassium Nitrate~ (KNO_{3}) can be purchased pure. It is used in the  dry way as an oxidizing agent. It is very fusible. It decomposes at a  low temperature into potassium nitrite (KNO_{2}) and free oxygen; and at  a higher temperature leaves potash (K_{2}O). It oxidizes sulphur and  carbon with explosive violence. This action may be moderated by mixing  the nitre with carbonate of soda, common salt, or some other inert body.    ~Potassium Nitrite~, KNO_{2}.--The commercial article is not pure, but  is sufficiently so for the purpose required. A saturated solution is  used in the separation of cobalt; the solution is made when wanted.    ~Potassium Permanganate~, KMnO_{4}.--This salt can be purchased  sufficiently pure. It is much used as an oxidizing agent.    ~Potassium Bisulphate~ (KHSO_{4}) is used as a dry reagent for opening  up minerals. It fuses; and at a much higher temperature is converted  into potassium sulphate with loss of sulphuric acid.    ~Potassium Sulphocyanate~ (KCNS) is used for the detection and  determination of traces of ferric iron; as also in the separation of  silver and copper from some of the other metals. Make a 10 per cent.  solution. It should show no colour on the addition of hydrochloric acid.    \"~Red Lead~\" (Pb_{3}O_{4}) is used in the dry assay as a flux instead of  litharge, from which it differs in containing a little more oxygen. When  acted on by nitric acid a brown residue of lead dioxide is left, nitrate  of lead going into solution. Like litharge it always carries silver;  about 2 milligrams in 100 grams.    ~Silver~, Ag.--Pure silver in foil is required as a standard. It may be  prepared as follows:--Dissolve scrap silver in dilute nitric acid and  decant off from any residue; dilute the solution with hot water and add  hydrochloric acid until there is no further precipitate, stir; allow the  precipitate to settle; decant and wash; dry the precipitate, mix it with  twice its bulk of carbonate of soda and fuse the mixture in a crucible  until tranquil; clean the button and roll or hammer it into foil.    ~Sodium Acetate~, NaC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}.3H_{2}O.--The crystals may be  purchased sufficiently pure. Make a 20 per cent. solution in water. It  is used for replacing mineral acids by acetic acid.[7]    ~Sodium Acetate and Acetic Acid.~--A solution is used in the  determination of phosphates and arsenates; 100 grams of the salt is  dissolved in 500 c.c. of acetic acid, and diluted with water to one  litre.    ~Sodium Bicarbonate~ (NaHCO_{3})is used as a flux in dry methods. On  ignition it leaves the carbonate (Na_{2}CO_{3}), which is used as a  standard reagent. Make a 20 per cent. solution of the carbonate for use.  It should be free from chlorides or sulphates, or if impure the amount  of impurities must be determined.    ~Sodium Hydrate~, NaHO. It may be purchased in sticks, which should be  kept in a well-corked bottle. It is sometimes called \"caustic soda.\" It  is a strong alkali. It is used for neutralizing acid solutions and for  separations where ammonia is unsuitable. Make a 5 per cent. solution for  use.    ~Sodium Hyposulphite~, Na_{2}S_{2}O_{8}.5H_{2}O.--It may be purchased  pure. It is generally known as \"hypo.\" It is used as a standard.    ~Sodium Sulphite~ (Na_{2}SO_{3}.7H_{2}O) is used as a reducing agent.    ~Sodium Phosphate~, Na_{2}HPO_{4}.12H_{2}O. The crystals may be  purchased pure, but they effloresce in dry air with loss of water. It  is used as a standard and for precipitating magnesia, &c."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18755"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part II-II (Secunda Secundae) (#18)"],[1,"of a habit may be considered from two points of  view: first, on the part of the object; secondly, on the part of its  participation by the subject.    Now the object of faith may be considered in two ways: first, in  respect of its formal aspect; secondly, in respect of the material  object which is proposed to be believed. Now the formal object of  faith is one and simple, namely the First Truth, as stated above (Q.  1, A. 1). Hence in this respect there is no diversity of faith among  believers, but it is specifically one in all, as stated above (Q. 4,  A. 6). But the things which are proposed as the matter of our belief  are many and can be received more or less explicitly; and in this  respect one man can believe explicitly more things than another, so  that faith can be greater in one man on account of its being more  explicit.    If, on the other hand, we consider faith from the point of view of  its participation by the subject, this happens in two ways, since the  act of faith proceeds both from the intellect and from the will, as  stated above (Q. 2, AA. 1, 2; Q. 4, A. 2). Consequently a man's faith  may be described as being greater, in one way, on the part of his  intellect, on account of its greater certitude and firmness, and, in  another way, on the part of his will, on account of his greater  promptitude, devotion, or confidence.    Reply Obj. 1: A man who obstinately disbelieves a thing that is of  faith, has not the habit of faith, and yet he who does not explicitly  believe all, while he is prepared to believe all, has that habit. In  this respect, one man has greater faith than another, on the part of  the object, in so far as he believes more things, as stated above.    Reply Obj. 2: It is essential to faith that one should give the first  place to the First Truth. But among those who do this, some submit to  it with greater certitude and devotion than others; and in this way  faith is greater in one than in another.    Reply Obj. 3: The understanding of principles results from man's very  nature, which is equally shared by all: whereas faith results from  the gift of grace, which is not equally in all, as explained above  (I-II, Q. 112, A. 4). Hence the comparison fails.    Nevertheless the truth of principles is more known to one than to  another, according to the greater capacity of intellect.  _______________________    QUESTION 6    OF THE CAUSE OF FAITH  (In Two Articles)    We must now consider the cause of faith, under which head there are  two points of inquiry:    (1) Whether faith is infused into man by God?    (2) Whether lifeless faith is a gift of God?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 6, Art. 1]    Whether Faith Is Infused into Man by God?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith is not infused into man by God.  For Augustine says (De Trin. xiv) that \"science begets faith in us,  and nourishes, defends and strengthens it.\" Now those things which  science begets in us seem to be acquired rather than infused.  Therefore faith does not seem to be in us by Divine infusion.    Obj. 2: Further, that to which man attains by hearing and seeing,  seems to be acquired by him. Now man attains to belief, both by  seeing miracles, and by hearing the teachings of faith: for it is  written (John 4:53): \"The father . . . knew that it was at the same  hour, that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed,  and his whole house\"; and (Rom. 10:17) it is said that \"faith is  through hearing.\" Therefore man attains to faith by acquiring it.    Obj. 3: Further, that which depends on a man's will can be acquired  by him. But \"faith depends on the believer's will,\" according to  Augustine (De Praedest. Sanct. v). Therefore faith can be acquired  by man.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Eph. 2:8, 9): \"By grace you are  saved through faith, and that not of yourselves . . . that no man  may glory . . . for it is the gift of God.\"    _I answer that,_ Two things are requisite for faith. First, that the  things which are of faith should be proposed to man: this is  necessary in order that man believe anything explicitly. The second  thing requisite for faith is the assent of the believer to the things  which are proposed to him. Accordingly, as regards the first of  these, faith must needs be from God. Because those things which are  of faith surpass human reason, hence they do not come to man's  knowledge, unless God reveal them. To some, indeed, they are revealed  by God immediately, as those things which were revealed to the  apostles and prophets, while to some they are proposed by God in  sending preachers of the faith, according to Rom. 10:15: \"How shall  they preach, unless they be sent?\"    As regards the second, viz. man's assent to the things which are of  faith, we may observe a twofold cause, one of external inducement,  such as seeing a miracle, or being persuaded by someone to embrace  the faith: neither of which is a sufficient cause, since of those who  see the same miracle, or who hear the same sermon, some believe, and  some do not. Hence we must assert another internal cause, which moves  man inwardly to assent to matters of faith.    The Pelagians held that this cause was nothing else than man's  free-will: and consequently they said that the beginning of faith is  from ourselves, inasmuch as, to wit, it is in our power to be ready  to assent to things which are of faith, but that the consummation of  faith is from God, Who proposes to us the things we have to believe.  But this is false, for, since man, by assenting to matters of faith,  is raised above his nature, this must needs accrue to him from some  supernatural principle moving him inwardly; and this is God.  Therefore faith, as regards the assent which is the chief act of  faith, is from God moving man inwardly by grace.    Reply Obj. 1: Science begets and nourishes faith, by way of  external persuasion afforded by science; but the chief and proper  cause of faith is that which moves man inwardly to assent.    Reply Obj. 2: This argument again refers to the cause that  proposes outwardly the things that are of faith, or persuades man to  believe by words or deeds.    Reply Obj. 3: To believe does indeed depend on the will of the  believer: but man's will needs to be prepared by God with grace, in  order that he may be raised to things which are above his nature, as  stated above (Q. 2, A. 3).  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 6, Art. 2]    Whether Lifeless Faith Is a Gift of God?    Objection 1: It would seem that lifeless faith is not a gift of God.  For it is written (Deut. 32:4) that \"the works of God are perfect.\" Now  lifeless faith is something imperfect. Therefore it is not the work of  God.    Obj. 2: Further, just as an act is said to be deformed through  lacking its due form, so too is faith called lifeless (_informis_)  when it lacks the form due to it. Now the deformed act of sin is not  from God, as stated above (I-II, Q. 79, A. 2, ad 2). Therefore  neither is lifeless faith from God.    Obj. 3: Further, whomsoever God heals, He heals wholly: for it is  written (John 7:23): \"If a man receive circumcision on the  sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry  at Me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath-day?\" Now  faith heals man from unbelief. Therefore whoever receives from God  the gift of faith, is at the same time healed from all his sins. But  this is not done except by living faith. Therefore living faith alone  is a gift of God: and consequently lifeless faith is not from God.    _On the contrary,_ A gloss on 1 Cor. 13:2 says that \"the faith which  lacks charity is a gift of God.\" Now this is lifeless faith.  Therefore lifeless faith is a gift of God.    _I answer that,_ Lifelessness is a privation. Now it must be noted  that privation is sometimes essential to the species, whereas  sometimes it is not, but supervenes in a thing already possessed of  its proper species: thus privation of the due equilibrium of the  humors is essential to the species of sickness, while darkness is not  essential to a diaphanous body, but supervenes in it. Since,  therefore, when we assign the cause of a thing, we intend to assign  the cause of that thing as existing in its proper species, it follows  that what is not the cause of privation, cannot be assigned as the  cause of the thing to which that privation belongs as being essential  to its species. For we cannot assign as the cause of a sickness,  something which is not the cause of a disturbance in the humors:  though we can assign as cause of a diaphanous body, something which  is not the cause of the darkness, which is not essential to the  diaphanous body.    Now the lifelessness of faith is not essential to the species of  faith, since faith is said to be lifeless through lack of an extrinsic  form, as stated above (Q. 4, A. 4). Consequently the cause of lifeless  faith is that which is the cause of faith strictly so called: and this  is God, as stated above (A. 1). It follows, therefore, that  lifeless faith is a gift of God.    Reply Obj. 1: Lifeless faith, though it is not simply perfect with  the perfection of a virtue, is, nevertheless, perfect with a  perfection that suffices for the essential notion of faith.    Reply Obj. 2: The deformity of an act is essential to the act's  species, considered as a moral act, as stated above (I, Q. 48, A. 1,  ad 2; I-II, Q. 18, A. 5): for an act is said to be deformed through  being deprived of an intrinsic form, viz. the due commensuration of  the act's circumstances. Hence we cannot say that God is the cause of  a deformed act, for He is not the cause of its deformity, though He  is the cause of the act as such.    We may also reply that deformity denotes not only privation of a  due form, but also a contrary disposition, wherefore deformity is  compared to the act, as falsehood is to faith. Hence, just as the  deformed act"]]]
