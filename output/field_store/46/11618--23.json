He has left nothing of the ancient law of  Moses, therefore he is the enemy of Moses.\" In reality His Holiness Christ  proclaimed and completed the law of Moses. He was the very helper and  assister of Moses. He spread the book of Moses throughout the world and  established anew the fundamentals of the law revealed by him. He abolished  certain unimportant laws and forms which were no longer compatible with  the exigencies of the time, such as divorce and plurality of wives. The  Jews did not comprehend this, and the cause of their ignorance was blind  and tenacious adherence to imitations of ancient forms and teachings;  therefore they finally sentenced His Holiness to death.    They likewise said, \"Through the tongues of the prophets it was announced  that during the time of Christ's appearance the justice of God would  prevail throughout the world, tyranny and oppression would be unknown,  justice would even extend to the animal kingdom, ferocious beasts would  associate in gentleness and peace, the wolf and the lamb would drink from  the same spring, the lion and the deer meet in the same meadow, the eagle  and quail dwell together in the same nest; but instead of this, we see  that during the time of this supposed Christ the Romans have conquered  Palestine and are ruling it with extreme tyranny, justice is nowhere  apparent and signs of peace in the kingdom are conspicuously absent.\"  These statements and attitudes of the Jews were inherited from their  fathers; blind allegiance to literal expectations which did not come to  pass during the time of Jesus Christ. The real purport of these prophetic  statements was that various peoples symbolized by the wolf and lamb  between whom love and fellowship were impossible would come together  during Messiah's reign, drink from the same fountain of life in his  teachings and become his devoted followers. This was realized when peoples  of all religions, nationalities and dispositions became united in their  beliefs and followed Christ in humility, associating in love and  brotherhood under the shadow of his divine protection. The Jews, being  blind to this and holding to their bigoted imitations, were insolent and  arrogant toward His Holiness and crucified him. Had they investigated the  reality of Christ they would have beheld his beauty and truth.    God has given man the eye of investigation by which he may see and  recognize truth. He has endowed man with ears that he may hear the message  of reality and conferred upon him the gift of reason by which he may  discover things for himself. This is his endowment and equipment for the  investigation of reality. Man is not intended to see through the eyes of  another, hear through another's ears nor comprehend with another's brain.  Each human creature has individual endowment, power and responsibility in  the creative plan of God. Therefore depend upon your own reason and  judgment and adhere to the outcome of your own investigation; otherwise  you will be utterly submerged in the sea of ignorance and deprived of all  the bounties of God. Turn to God, supplicate humbly at His threshold,  seeking assistance and confirmation, that God may rend asunder the veils  that obscure your vision. Then will your eyes be filled with illumination,  face to face you will behold the reality of God and your heart become  completely purified from the dross of ignorance, reflecting the glories  and bounties of the Kingdom.    Holy souls are like soil which has been plowed and tilled with much  earnest labor; the thorns and thistles cast aside and all weeds uprooted.  Such soil is most fruitful and the harvest from it will prove full and  plenteous. In this same way man must free himself from the weeds of  ignorance, thorns of superstitions and thistles of imitations, that he may  discover reality in the harvests of true knowledge. Otherwise the  discovery of reality is impossible, contention and divergence of religious  belief will always remain and mankind, like ferocious wolves will rage and  attack each other in hatred and antagonism. We supplicate God that He may  destroy the veils which limit our vision and that these becloudings which  darken the way of the manifestation of the shining lights may be dispelled  in order that the effulgent Sun of Reality may shine forth. We implore and  invoke God, seeking His assistance and confirmation. Man is a child of  God; most noble, lofty and beloved by God his creator. Therefore he must  ever strive that the divine bounties and virtues bestowed upon him may  prevail and control him. Just now the soil of human hearts seems like  black earth, but in the innermost substance of this dark soil there are  thousands of fragrant flowers latent. We must endeavor to cultivate and  awaken these potentialities, discover the secret treasure in this very  mine and depository of God, bring forth these resplendent powers long  hidden in human hearts. Then will the glories of both worlds be blended  and increased and the quintessence of human existence be made manifest.    We must not be content with simply following a certain course because we  find our fathers pursued that course. It is the duty of everyone to  investigate reality, and investigation of reality by another will not do  for us. If all in the world were rich and one man poor, of what use are  these riches to that man? If all the world be virtuous and a man steeped  in vice, what good results are forthcoming from him? If all the world be  resplendent and a man blind, where are his benefits? If all the world be  in plenty and a man hungry, what sustenance does he derive? Therefore  every man must be an investigator for himself. Ideas and beliefs left by  his fathers and ancestors as a heritage will not suffice, for adherence to  these are but imitations and imitations have ever been a cause of  disappointment and misguidance. Be investigators of reality, that you may  attain the verity of truth and life.    You have asked why it was necessary for the soul that was from God to make  this journey back to God. Would you like to understand the reality of this  question just as I teach it or do you wish to hear it as the world teaches  it?--for if I should answer you according to the latter way, this would be  but imitation and would not make the subject clear.    The reality underlying this question is that the evil spirit, Satan or  whatever is interpreted as evil, refers to the lower nature in man. This  baser nature is symbolized in various ways. In man there are two  expressions, one is the expression of nature, the other the expression of  the spiritual realm. The world of nature is defective. Look at it clearly,  casting aside all superstition and imagination. If you should leave a man  uneducated and barbarous in the wilds of Africa, would there be any doubt  about his remaining ignorant? God has never created an evil spirit; all  such ideas and nomenclature are symbols expressing the mere human or  earthly nature of man. It is an essential condition of the soil of earth  that thorns, weeds and fruitless trees may grow from it. Relatively  speaking, this is evil; it is simply the lower state and baser product of  nature.    It is evident therefore that man is in need of divine education and  inspiration; that the spirit and bounties of God are essential to his  development. That is to say, the teachings of Christ and the prophets are  necessary for his education and guidance. Why? Because they are the divine  gardeners who till the earth of human hearts and minds. They educate man,  uproot the weeds, burn the thorns and remodel the waste places into  gardens and orchards where fruitful trees grow. The wisdom and purpose of  their training is that man must pass from degree to degree of progressive  unfoldment until perfection is attained. For instance, if a man should  live his entire life in one city, he cannot gain a knowledge of the whole  world. To become perfectly informed he must visit other cities, see the  mountains and valleys, cross the rivers and traverse the plains. In other  words, without progressive and universal education, perfection will not be  attained.    Man must walk in many paths and be subjected to various processes in his  evolution upward. Physically he is not born in full stature but passes  through consecutive stages of foetus, infant, childhood, youth, maturity  and old age. Suppose he had the power to remain young throughout his life.  He then would not understand the meaning of old age and could not believe  it existed. If he could not realize the condition of old age he would not  know that he was young. He would not know the difference between young and  old without experiencing the old. Unless you have passed through the state  of infancy how would you know this was an infant beside you? If there was  no wrong how would you recognize the right? If it were not for sin how  would you appreciate virtue? If evil deeds were unknown how could you  commend good actions? If sickness did not exist how would you understand  health? Evil is non-existent; it is the absence of good; sickness is the  loss of health; poverty the lack of riches. When wealth disappears you are  poor; you look within the treasure box but find nothing there. Without  knowledge there is ignorance; therefore ignorance is simply the lack of  knowledge. Death is the absence of life. Therefore on the one hand we have  existence; on the other, nonexistence, negation or absence of existence.    Briefly; the journey of the soul is necessary. The pathway of life is the  road which leads to divine knowledge and attainment. Without training and  guidance the soul could never progress beyond the conditions of its lower  nature which is ignorant and defective.            RELIGION: ESSENTIAL AND NON-ESSENTI"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#18)"],[1,"all, trained them, provided for them and protected them.  There is no doubt that the Shepherd is kind to all the sheep and should  there be among these sheep ignorant ones, they must be educated; if there  be children, they must be trained until they reach maturity; if there be  sick ones, they must be cured. There must be no hatred and enmity, for as  by a kind physician these ignorant, sick ones should be treated.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is, that religion must  be the cause of fellowship and love. If it becomes the cause of  estrangement then it is not needed, for religion is like a remedy; if it  aggravates the disease then it becomes unnecessary.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is, that religion must be in  conformity with science and reason, so that it may influence the hearts of  men. The foundation must be solid and must not consist of imitations.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is, that religious, racial,  political, economic and patriotic prejudices destroy the edifice of  humanity. As long as these prejudices prevail, the world of humanity will  not have rest. For a period of 6,000 years history informs us about the  world of humanity. During these 6,000 years the world of humanity has not  been free from war, strife, murder and bloodthirstiness. In every period  war has been waged in one country or another and that war was due to  either religious prejudice, racial prejudice, political prejudice or  patriotic prejudice. It has therefore been ascertained and proved that all  prejudices are destructive of the human edifice. As long as these  prejudices persist, the struggle for existence must remain dominant, and  bloodthirstiness and rapacity continue. Therefore, even as was the case in  the past, the world of humanity cannot be saved from the darkness of  nature and cannot attain illumination except through the abandonment of  prejudices and the acquisition of the morals of the Kingdom.    If this prejudice and enmity are on account of religion (consider that),  religion should be the cause of fellowship, otherwise it is fruitless. And  if this prejudice be the prejudice of nationality (consider that) all  mankind are of one nation; all have sprung from the tree of Adam, and Adam  is the root of the tree. That tree is one and all these nations are like  branches, while the individuals of humanity are like leaves, blossoms and  fruits thereof. Then the establishment of various nations and the  consequent shedding of blood and destruction of the edifice of humanity  result from human ignorance and selfish motives.    As to the patriotic prejudice, this is also due to absolute ignorance, for  the surface of the earth is one native land. Every one can live in any  spot on the terrestrial globe. Therefore all the world is man's  birthplace. These boundaries and outlets have been devised by man. In the  creation, such boundaries and outlets were not assigned. Europe is one  continent, Asia is one continent, Africa is one continent, Australia is  one continent, but some of the souls, from personal motives and selfish  interests, have divided each one of these continents and considered a  certain part as their own country. God has set up no frontier between  France and Germany; they are continuous. Yea, in the first centuries,  selfish souls, for the promotion of their own interests, have assigned  boundaries and outlets and have, day by day, attached more importance to  these, until this led to intense enmity, bloodshed and rapacity in  subsequent centuries. In the same way this will continue indefinitely, and  if this conception of patriotism remains limited within a certain circle,  it will be the primary cause of the world's destruction. No wise and just  person will acknowledge these imaginary distinctions. Every limited area  which we call our native country we regard as our mother-land, whereas the  terrestrial globe is the mother-land of all, and not any restricted area.  In short, for a few days we live on this earth and eventually we are  buried in it, it is our eternal tomb. Is it worth while that we should  engage in bloodshed and tear one another to pieces for this eternal tomb?  Nay, far from it, neither is God pleased with such conduct nor would any  sane man approve of it.    Consider! The blessed animals engage in no patriotic quarrels. They are in  the utmost fellowship with one another and live together in harmony. For  example, if a dove from the East and a dove from the West, a dove from the  North and a dove from the South chance to arrive, at the same time, in one  spot, they immediately associate in harmony. So is it with all the blessed  animals and birds. But ferocious animals, as soon as they meet, attack and  fight with each other, tear each other to pieces and it is impossible for  them to live peaceably together in one spot. They are all unsociable and  fierce, savage and combative fighters.    Regarding the economic prejudice, it is apparent that whenever the ties  between nations become strengthened and the exchange of commodities  accelerated, and any economic principle is established in one country, it  will ultimately affect the other countries and universal benefits will  result. Then why this prejudice?    As to the political prejudice, the policy of God must be followed and it  is indisputable that the policy of God is greater than human policy. We  must follow the Divine policy and that applies alike to all individuals.  He treats all individuals alike: no distinction is made, and that is the  foundation of the Divine Religions.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is the origination of  one language that may be spread universally among the people. This  teaching was revealed from the pen of His Holiness Baha'u'llah in order  that this universal language may eliminate misunderstandings from among  mankind.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is the equality of  women and men. The world of humanity has two wings--one is women and the  other men. Not until both wings are equally developed can the bird fly.  Should one wing remain weak, flight is impossible. Not until the world of  women becomes equal to the world of men in the acquisition of virtues and  perfections, can success and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is voluntary sharing of one's  property with others among mankind. This voluntary sharing is greater than  equality, and consists in this, that man should not prefer himself to  others, but rather should sacrifice his life and property for others. But  this should not be introduced by coercion so that it becomes a law and man  is compelled to follow it. Nay, rather, man should voluntarily and of his  own choice sacrifice his property and life for others, and spend willingly  for the poor, just as is done in Iran among the Baha'is.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is man's freedom, that  through the ideal Power he should be free and emancipated from the  captivity of the world of nature; for as long as man is captive to nature  he is a ferocious animal, as the struggle for existence is one of the  exigencies of the world of nature. This matter of the struggle for  existence is the fountain-head of all calamities and is the supreme  affliction.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that religion is a mighty  bulwark. If the edifice of religion shakes and totters, commotion and  chaos will ensue and the order of things will be utterly upset, for in the  world of mankind there are two safeguards that protect man from  wrongdoing. One is the law which punishes the criminal; but the law  prevents only the manifest crime and not the concealed sin; whereas the  ideal safeguard, namely, the religion of God, prevents both the manifest  and the concealed crime, trains man, educates morals, compels the adoption  of virtues and is the all-inclusive power which guarantees the felicity of  the world of mankind. But by religion is meant that which is ascertained  by investigation and not that which is based on mere imitation, the  foundation of Divine Religions and not human imitations.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that although material  civilization is one of the means for the progress of the world of mankind,  yet until it becomes combined with Divine civilization, the desired  result, which is the felicity of mankind, will not be attained. Consider!  These battleships that reduce a city to ruins within the space of an hour  are the result of material civilization; likewise the Krupp guns, the  Mauser rifles, dynamite, submarines, torpedo boats, armed aircraft and  bombing aeroplanes--all these weapons of war are the malignant fruits of  material civilization. Had material civilization been combined with Divine  civilization, these fiery weapons would never have been invented. Nay,  rather, human energy would have been wholly devoted to useful inventions  and would have been concentrated on praiseworthy discoveries. Material  civilization is like a lamp-glass. Divine civilization is the lamp itself  and the glass without the light is dark. Material civilization is like the  body. No matter how infinitely graceful, elegant and beautiful it may be,  it is dead. Divine civilization is like the spirit, and the body gets its  life from the spirit, otherwise it becomes a corpse. It has thus been made  evident that the world of mankind is in need of the breaths of the Holy  Spirit. Without the spirit the world of mankind is lifeless, and without  this light the world of mankind is in utter darkness. For the world of  nature is an animal world. Until man is born again from the world of  nature, that is to say, becomes detached from the world of nature, he is  essentially an animal, and it is the teachings of God which converts this  animal into a human soul.    And among the teachings of"]]]
