The first textbook on rhetoric which still remains to us was written by  Aristotle.  He defines rhetoric as the art of writing effectively,  viewing it primarily as the art of persuasion in public speaking,  but making it include all the devices for convincing or moving the mind  of the hearer or reader.    Aristotle's treatise is profound and scholarly, and every textbook of  rhetoric since written is little more than a restatement of some part  of his comprehensive work.  It is a scientific analysis of the subject,  prepared for critics and men of a highly cultured and investigating turn  of mind, and was not originally intended to instruct ordinary persons  in the management of words and sentences for practical purposes.    While no one doubts that an ordinary command of words may be learned,  there is an almost universal impression in the public mind, and has been  even from the time of Aristotle himself, that writing well or ill is  almost purely a matter of talent, genius, or, let us say, instinct.  It has been truly observed that the formal study of rhetoric never has  made a single successful writer, and a great many writers have succeeded  preeminently without ever having opened a rhetorical textbook.  It has  not been difficult, therefore, to come to the conclusion that writing  well or ill comes by nature alone, and that all we can do is to pray for  luck,---or, at the most, to practise incessantly."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#18)"],[1,"conversation ran upon high life and high-lived company, with pictures,  taste, and Shakespeare.    But we could have borne all this, had not a fortune-telling gypsy come  to raise us into perfect [v]sublimity. The tawny [v]sibyl no sooner  appeared than my girls came running to me for a shilling apiece to cross  her hand with silver. To say the truth, I was tired of being always  wise, and could not help gratifying their request, because I loved to  see them happy. I gave each of them a shilling; after they had been  closeted up with the fortune-teller for some time, I knew by their  looks, upon their returning, that they had been promised something  great.    \"Well, my girls, how have you sped? Tell me, Livy, has the  fortune-teller given thee a penny-worth?\"    \"She positively declared that I am to be married to a squire in less  than a twelvemonth.\"    \"Well, now, Sophy, my child,\" said I, \"and what sort of husband are you  to have?\"    \"I am to have a lord soon after my sister has married the squire,\" she  replied.    \"How,\" cried I, \"is that all you are to have for your two shillings?  Only a lord and a squire for two shillings! You fools, I could have  promised you a prince and a [v]nabob for half the money.\"    This curiosity of theirs, however, was attended with very serious  effects. We now began to think ourselves designed by the stars to  something exalted, and already anticipated our future grandeur.    In this agreeable time my wife had the most lucky dreams in the world,  which she took care to tell us every morning, with great solemnity and  exactness. It was one night a coffin and cross-bones, the sign of an  approaching wedding; at another time she imagined her daughters' pockets  filled with farthings, a certain sign they would shortly be stuffed with  gold. The girls themselves had their omens. They saw rings in the  candle, purses bounced from the fire, and love-knots lurked in the  bottom of every teacup.    Toward the end of the week we received a card from two town ladies, in  which, with their compliments, they hoped to see our family at church  the Sunday following. All Saturday morning I could perceive, in  consequence of this, my wife and daughters in close conference together,  and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a [v]latent  plot. To be sincere, I had strong suspicions that some absurd proposal  was preparing for appearing with splendor the next day. In the evening  they began their operations in a very regular manner, and my wife  undertook to conduct the siege. After tea, when I seemed in fine  spirits, she began thus:    \"I fancy, Charles, my dear, we shall have a great deal of good company  at our church to-morrow.\"    \"Perhaps we may, my dear,\" returned I, \"though you need be under no  uneasiness about that; you shall have a sermon, whether there be or  not.\"    \"That is what I expect,\" returned she; \"but I think, my dear, we ought  to appear there as decently as possible, for who knows what may happen?\"    \"Your precautions,\" replied I, \"are highly commendable. A decent  behavior and appearance in church is what charms me. We should be devout  and humble, cheerful and serene.\"    \"Yes,\" cried she, \"I know that; but I mean we should go there in as  proper a manner as possible; not like the scrubs about us.\"    \"You are quite right, my dear,\" returned I, \"and I was going to make the  same proposal. The proper manner of going is to go as early as  possible, to have time for meditation before the sermon begins.\"    \"Phoo! Charles,\" interrupted she, \"all that is very true, but not what I  would be at. I mean, we should go there [v]genteelly. You know the  church is two miles off, and I protest I don't like to see my daughters  trudging up to their pew all blowzed and red with walking, and looking  for all the world as if they had been winners at a [v]smock race. Now,  my dear, my proposal is this: there are our two plough-horses, the colt  that has been in our family these nine years and his companion,  Blackberry, that has scarce done an earthly thing for this month past.  They are both grown fat and lazy. Why should they not do something as  well as we? And let me tell you, when Moses has trimmed them a little,  they will cut a very tolerable figure.\"    To this proposal I objected that walking would be twenty times more  genteel than such a paltry conveyance, as Blackberry was wall-eyed, and  the colt wanted a tail; that they had never been broken to the rein, but  had an hundred vicious tricks, and that we had but one saddle and  [v]pillion in the whole house. All these objections, however, were  overruled, so that I was obliged to comply.    The next morning I perceived them not a little busy in collecting such  materials as might be necessary for the expedition; but as I found it  would be a business of time, I walked on to the church before, and they  promised speedily to follow. I waited near an hour in the reading desk  for their arrival; but not finding them come as I expected, I was  obliged to begin, and went through the service, not without some  uneasiness at finding them absent.    This was increased when all was finished, and no appearance of the  family. I therefore walked back by the horseway, which was five miles  round, though the footway was but two; and when I had got about half-way  home, I perceived the procession marching slowly forward toward the  church--my son, my wife, and the two little ones exalted on one horse,  and my two daughters upon the other. It was then very near dinner-time.    I demanded the cause of their delay, but I soon found, by their looks,  that they had met with a thousand misfortunes on the road. The horses  had, at first, refused to move from the door, till a neighbor was kind  enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel.  Next, the straps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were obliged  to stop to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of the  horses took it into his head to stand still, and neither blows nor  entreaties could prevail with him to proceed. They were just recovering  from this dismal situation when I found them; but, perceiving everything  safe, I own their mortification did not much displease me, as it gave  me many opportunities of future triumph, and would teach my daughters  more humility.

SIR EDWARD DYER.          THE LITTLE BOY IN THE BALCONY      My special amusement in New York is riding on the elevated railway. It  is curious to note how little one can see on the crowded sidewalks of  this city. It is simply a rush of the same people--hurrying this way or  that on the same errands, doing the same shopping or eating at the same  restaurants. It is a [v]kaleidoscope with infinite combinations but the  same effects. You see it to-day, and it is the same as yesterday.  Occasionally in the multitude you hit upon a [v]_genre_ specimen, or an  odd detail, such as a prim little dog that sits upright all day and  holds in its mouth a cup for pennies for its blind master, or an old  bookseller, with a grand head and the deliberate motions of a scholar,  moldering in a stall--but the general effect is one of sameness and soon  tires and bewilders.    Once on the elevated road, however, a new world is opened, full of the  most interesting objects. The cars sweep by the upper stories of the  houses, and, running never too swiftly to allow observation, disclose  the secrets of a thousand homes, and bring to view people and things  never dreamed of by the giddy, restless crowd that sends its impatient  murmur from the streets below. In a course of several months' pretty  steady riding from Twenty-third Street, which is the station for the  Fifth Avenue Hotel, to Rector, which overlooks Wall Street, I have made  many acquaintances along the route, and on reaching the city my first  curiosity is in their behalf.    One of these is a boy about six years of age--akin in his fragile body  and his serious mien--a youngster that is very precious to me. I first  saw this boy on a little balcony about three feet by four, projecting  from the window of a poverty-stricken fourth floor. He was leaning over  the railing, his white, thoughtful head just clearing the top, holding a  short, round stick in his hand. The little fellow made a pathetic  picture, all alone there above the street, so friendless and desolate,  and his pale face came between me and my business many a time that day.  On going uptown that evening just as night was falling, I saw him still  at his place, white and patient and silent.    Every day afterward I saw him there, always with the short stick in his  hand. Occasionally he would walk around the balcony, rattling the stick  in a solemn manner against the railing, or poke it across from one  corner to another and sit on it. This was the only playing I ever saw  him do, and the stick was the only plaything he had. But he"]]]
