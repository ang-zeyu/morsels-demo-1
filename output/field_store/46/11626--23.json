LADY SNEERWELL. Provoking--insolent!--may your Husband live these fifty  years!         [Exit.]    SIR PETER. Oons what a Fury----    LADY TEAZLE. A malicious Creature indeed!    SIR PETER. Hey--not for her last wish?--    LADY TEAZLE. O No--    SIR OLIVER. Well Sir, and what have you to say now?    SURFACE. Sir, I am so confounded, to find that Lady Sneerwell could be  guilty of suborning Mr. Snake in this manner to impose on us all that  I know not what to say----however, lest her Revengeful Spirit should  prompt her to injure my Brother I had certainly better follow her  directly.         [Exit.]    SIR PETER. Moral to the last drop!    SIR OLIVER. Aye and marry her Joseph if you can.--Oil and Vinegar  egad:--you'll do very well together.    ROWLEY. I believe we have no more occasion for Mr. Snake at Present--    SNAKE. Before I go--I beg Pardon once for all for whatever uneasiness I  have been the humble instrument of causing to the Parties present.    SIR PETER. Well--well you have made atonement by a good Deed at last--    SNAKE. But I must Request of the Company that it shall never be known--    SIR PETER. Hey!--what the Plague--are you ashamed of having done a right  thing once in your life?    SNAKE. Ah: Sir--consider I live by the Badness of my Character!--I have  nothing but my Infamy to depend on!--and, if it were once known that I  had been betray'd into an honest Action, I should lose every Friend I  have in the world.    SIR OLIVER. Well--well we'll not traduce you by saying anything to your  Praise never fear.         [Exit SNAKE.]    SIR PETER. There's a precious Rogue--Yet that fellow is a Writer and a  Critic.    LADY TEAZLE. See[,] Sir Oliver[,] there needs no persuasion now to  reconcile your Nephew and Maria--    SIR OLIVER. Aye--aye--that's as it should be and egad we'll have the  wedding to-morrow morning--    CHARLES. Thank you, dear Unkle!    SIR PETER. What! you rogue don't you ask the Girl's consent first--    CHARLES. Oh, I have done that a long time--above a minute ago--and She  has look'd yes--    MARIA. For Shame--Charles--I protest Sir Peter, there has not been a  word----    SIR OLIVER. Well then the fewer the Better--may your love for each other  never know--abatement.    SIR PETER. And may you live as happily together as Lady Teazle and  I--intend to do--    CHARLES. Rowley my old Friend--I am sure you congratulate me and I  suspect too that I owe you much.    SIR OLIVER. You do, indeed, Charles--    ROWLEY. If my Efforts to serve you had not succeeded you would have been  in my debt for the attempt--but deserve to be happy--and you over-repay  me.    SIR PETER. Aye honest Rowley always said you would reform.    CHARLES. Why as to reforming Sir Peter I'll make no promises--and that  I take to be a proof that I intend to set about it--But here shall be my  Monitor--my gentle Guide.--ah! can I leave the Virtuous path those Eyes  illumine?       Tho' thou, dear Maid, should'st wave [waive] thy Beauty's Sway,     --Thou still must Rule--because I will obey:     An humbled fugitive from Folly View,     No sanctuary near but Love and YOU:     You can indeed each anxious Fear remove,     For even Scandal dies if you approve.  [To the audience.]         EPILOGUE         BY MR. COLMAN         SPOKEN BY LADY TEAZLE         I, who was late so volatile and gay,       Like a trade-wind must now blow all one way,       Bend all my cares, my studies, and my vows,       To one dull rusty weathercock--my spouse!       So wills our virtuous bard--the motley Bayes       Of crying epilogues and laughing plays!       Old bachelors, who marry smart young wives,       Learn from our play to regulate your lives:       Each bring his dear to town, all faults upon her--       London will prove the very source of honour.       Plunged fairly in, like a cold bath it serves,       When principles relax, to brace the nerves:       Such is my case; and yet I must deplore       That the gay dream of dissipation's o'er.       And say, ye fair! was ever lively wife,       Born with a genius for the highest life,       Like me untimely blasted in her bloom,       Like me condemn'd to such a dismal doom?       Save money--when I just knew how to waste it!       Leave London--just as I began to taste it!         Must I then watch the early crowing cock,       The melancholy ticking of a clock;       In a lone rustic hall for ever pounded,       With dogs, cats, rats, and squalling brats surrounded?       With humble curate can I now retire,       (While good Sir Peter boozes with the squire,)       And at backgammon mortify my soul,       That pants for loo, or flutters at a vole?       Seven's the main!  Dear sound that must expire,       Lost at hot cockles round a Christmas fire;       The transient hour of fashion too soon spent,       Farewell the tranquil mind, farewell content!       Farewell the plumed head, the cushion'd tete,       That takes the cushion from its proper seat!       That spirit-stirring drum!--card drums I mean,       Spadille--odd trick--pam--basto--king and queen!       And you, ye knockers, that, with brazen throat,       The welcome visitors' approach denote;       Farewell all quality of high renown,       Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious town!       Farewell! your revels I partake no more,       And Lady Teazle's occupation's o'er!       All this I told our bard; he smiled, and said 'twas clear,       I ought to play deep tragedy next year.       Meanwhile he drew wise morals from his play,       And in these solemn periods stalk'd away:--       \"Bless'd were the fair like you; her faults who stopp'd,       And closed her follies when the curtain dropp'd!       No more in vice or error to engage,       Or play the fool at large on life's great stage.\"      END OF PLAY          <1> This PORTRAIT and Garrick's PROLOGUE are not included in Fraser  Rae's text.    <2> From Sheridan's manuscript.    <3> The story in Act I. Scene I., told by Crabtree about Miss Letitia  Piper, is repeated here, the speaker being Sir Peter:       SIR PETER.  O nine out of ten malicious inventions are founded     on some ridiculous misrepresentation--Mrs. Candour you remember     how poor Miss Shepherd lost her Lover and her Character one     Summer at Tunbridge.       MRS. C.  To be sure that was a very ridiculous affair.       CRABTREE.  Pray tell us Sir Peter how it was.       SIR P.  Why madam--[The story follows.]       MRS. C.  Ha ha strange indeed--       SIR P.  Matter of Fact I assure you....       LADY T.  As sure as can be--Sir Peter will grow scandalous     himself--if you encourage him to tell stories.

Carmel--such a man, blinded by his extraordinary success  and aspiring after an uncontrolled domination over the beliefs and  activities of his fellow-disciples, insolently raised the standard of  revolt. Seceding from 'Abdu'l-Baha and allying himself with the Arch-Enemy  of the Faith of God, this deluded apostate sought, by perverting the  teachings and directing a campaign of unrelenting vilification against the  person of 'Abdu'l-Baha, to undermine the faith of those believers whom he  had during no less than eight years, so strenuously toiled to convert. By  the tracts he published, through the active collaboration of the  emissaries of his chief Ally, and reinforced by the efforts which the  Christian ecclesiastical enemies of the Baha'i Revelation were beginning  to exert, he succeeded in dealing the nascent Faith of God a blow from  which it could only slowly and painfully recover.    I need not dwell on the immediate effects of this serious yet transitory  cleavage in the ranks of the American adherents of the Cause of  Baha'u'llah. Nor do I need to expatiate on the character of the defamatory  writings that poured upon them. Nor does it seem necessary to recount the  measures to which an ever-vigilant Master resorted in order to assuage and  eventually to dissipate their apprehensions. It is for the future  historian to appraise the value of the mission of each of the four chosen  messengers of 'Abdu'l-Baha who, in rapid succession, were dispatched by  Him to pacify and reinvigorate that troubled community. His will be the  task of tracing, in the work which these deputies of 'Abdu'l-Baha were  commissioned to undertake, the beginnings of that vast Administration, the  corner-stone of which these messengers were instructed to lay--an  Administration whose symbolic Edifice He, at a later time, was to found in  person and whose basis and scope the provisions of His Will were destined  to widen.    Suffice it to say that at this stage of its evolution the activities of an  invincible Faith had assumed such dimensions as to force on the one hand  its enemies to devise fresh weapons for their projected assaults, and on  the other to encourage its supreme Promoter to instruct its followers,  through qualified representatives and teachers, in the rudiments of an  Administration which, as it evolved, would at once incarnate, safeguard  and foster its spirit. The works of such stubborn assailants as those of  Vatralsky, Wilson, Jessup and Richardson vie with one another in their  futile attempts to stain its purity, to arrest its march and compel its  surrender. To the charges of Nihilism, of heresy, of Muhammadan  Gnosticism, of immorality, of Occultism and Communism so freely leveled  against them, the undismayed victims of such outrageous denunciations,  acting under the instructions of 'Abdu'l-Baha, retorted by initiating a  series of activities which by their very nature were to be the precursors  of permanent, officially recognized administrative institutions. The  inauguration of Chicago's first House of Spirituality designated by  'Abdu'l-Baha as that city's \"House of Justice\"; the establishment of the  Baha'i Publishing Society; the founding of the Green Acre Fellowship; the  publication of the Star of the West; the holding of the first Baha'i  National Convention, synchronizing with the transference of the sacred  remains of the Bab to its final resting-place on Mt. Carmel; the  incorporation of the Baha'i Temple Unity and the formation of the  Executive Committee of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar--these stand out as the  most conspicuous accomplishments of the American believers which have  immortalized the memory of the most turbulent period of their history.  Launched through these very acts into the troublesome seas of ceaseless  tribulation, piloted by the mighty arm of 'Abdu'l-Baha and manned by the  bold initiative and abundant vitality of a band of sorely-tried disciples,  the Ark of Baha'u'llah's Covenant has, ever since those days, been  steadily pursuing its course contemptuous of the storms of bitter  misfortune that have raged, and which must continue to assail it, as it  forges ahead towards the promised haven of undisturbed security and peace.    Unsatisfied with the achievements which crowned the concerted efforts of  their elected representatives within the American continent, and  emboldened by the initial success of their pioneer teachers, beyond its  confines, in Great Britain, France and Germany, the community of the  American believers resolved to win in distant climes fresh recruits to the  advancing army of Baha'u'llah. Setting out from the western shores of  their native land and impelled by the indomitable energy of a new-born  faith, these itinerant teachers of the Gospel of Baha'u'llah pushed on  towards the islands of the Pacific, and as far as China and Japan,  determined to establish beyond the farthest seas the outposts of their  beloved Faith. Both at home and abroad this community had by that time  demonstrated its capacity to widen the range and consolidate the  foundations of its vast endeavors. The angry voices that had been raised  in protest against its rise were being drowned amid the acclamations with  which the East greeted its recent victories. Those ugly features that had  loomed so threateningly were gradually receding into the distance,  furnishing a still wider field to these noble warriors for the exercise of  their latent energies.    The Faith of Baha'u'llah in the continent of America had indeed been  resuscitated. Phoenix-like it had risen in all its freshness, vigor and  beauty and was now, through the voice of its triumphant exponents,  insistingly calling to 'Abdu'l-Baha, imploring Him to undertake a journey  to its shores. The first fruits of the mission entrusted to its worthy  upholders had lent such poignancy to their call that 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who had  just been delivered from the fetters of a galling tyranny, found Himself  unable to resist. His great, His incomparable, love for His own favored  children impelled Him to respond. Their passionate entreaty had, moreover,  been reinforced by the numerous invitations which representatives of  various interested organizations, whether religious, educational or  humanitarian, had extended to Him, expressing their eagerness to receive  from His own mouth an exposition of His Father's teachings.    Though bent with age, though suffering from ailments resulting from the  accumulated cares of fifty years of exile and captivity, 'Abdu'l-Baha set  out on His memorable journey across the seas to the land where He might  bless by His presence, and sanctify through His deeds, the mighty acts His  spirit had led His disciples to perform. The circumstances that have  attended His triumphal progress through the chief cities of the United  States and Canada my pen is utterly incapable of describing. The joys  which the announcement of His arrival evoked, the publicity which His  activities created, the forces which His utterances released, the  opposition which the implications of His teachings excited, the  significant episodes to which His words and deeds continually gave  rise--these future generations will, no doubt, minutely and befittingly  register. They will carefully delineate their features, will cherish and  preserve their memory, and will transmit unimpaired the record of their  minutest details to their descendants. It would indeed be presumptuous on  our part to attempt, at the present time, to sketch even the bare outline  of so vast, so enthralling a theme. Contemplating after the lapse of above  twenty years this notable landmark in America's spiritual history we still  find ourselves compelled to confess our inability to grasp its import or  to fathom its mystery. I have alluded in the preceding pages to a few of  the more salient features of that never-to-be-forgotten visit. These  incidents, as we look back upon them, eloquently proclaim 'Abdu'l-Baha's  specific purpose to confer through these symbolic functions upon the  first-born of the communities of the West that spiritual primacy which was  to be the birthright of the American believers.    The seeds which 'Abdu'l-Baha's ceaseless activities so lavishly scattered  had endowed the United States and Canada, nay the entire continent, with  potentialities such as it had never known in its history. On the small  band of His trained and beloved disciples, and through them on their  descendants, He, through that visit, had bequeathed a priceless heritage--a  heritage which carried with it the sacred and primary obligation to arise  and carry on in that fertile field the work He had so gloriously  initiated. We can dimly picture to ourselves the wishes that must have  welled from His eager heart as He bade His last farewell to that promising  country. An inscrutable Wisdom, we can well imagine Him remark to His  disciples on the eve of His departure, has, in His infinite bounty singled  out your native land for the execution of a mighty purpose. Through the  agency of Baha'u'llah's Covenant I, as the ploughman, have been called  upon since the beginning of my ministry to turn up and break its ground.  The mighty confirmations that have, in the opening days of your career,  rained upon you have prepared and invigorated its soil. The tribulations  you subsequently were made to suffer have driven deep furrows into the  field which my hands had prepared. The seeds with which I have been  entrusted I have now scattered far and wide before you. Under your loving  care, by your ceaseless exertions, every one of these seeds must  germinate, every one must yield its destined fruit. A winter of  unprecedented severity will soon be upon"]]]
