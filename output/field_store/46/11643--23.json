A rope end was thrown, caught  by one of them. And then they swam with powerful strokes toward the  drifting boat. Once the rope was made fast the small craft was drawn  toward Torgul's command, the crewmen swimming beside it. Ross longed to  know the reason for the tense expectancy of the men around him. It was  apparent the skiff had some ominous meaning for them.    Ross caught a glimpse of a body huddled within the craft. Under Torgul's  orders a sling was dropped, to rise, weighted with a passenger. The  Terran was shouldered back from the rail as the limp body was hurried  into the Captain's cabin. Several crewmen slid down to make an  examination of the boat itself.    Their heads came up, their eyes searched along the rail and centered on  Ross. The hostility was so open the Terran braced himself to meet those  cold stares as he would a rush from a challenger.    A slight sound behind sent Ross leaping to the right, wanting to get his  back against solid protection. Loketh came up, his limp making him  awkward so that he clutched at the rail for support. In his other hand  was one of the hooked swords bared and ready.    \"Get the murderers!\" Someone in the back line of the massing crew yipped  that.    Ross drew his diver's knife. Shaken at this sudden change in the crew's  attitude, he was warily on the defensive. Loketh was beside him now and  the Hawaikan nodded to the sea.    \"Better go there,\" he cried. \"Over before they try to gut you!\"    \"Kill!\" The word shrilled into a roar from the Rovers. They started up  the deck toward Ross and Loketh. Then someone leaped between, and Vistur  fronted his own comrades.    \"Stand away--\" One of the others ran forward, thrusting at the tall  Rover with a stiffened out-held arm to fend him out of their path.    Vistur rolled a shoulder, sending the fellow shunting away. He went down  while two more, unable to halt, thudded on him. Vistur stamped on an  outstretched hand and sent a sword spinning.    \"What goes here!\" Torgul's demand was loud enough to be heard. It  stopped a few of the crew and two more went down as the Captain struck  out with his fists. Then he was facing Ross, and the chill in his eyes  was the threat the others had voiced.    \"I told you, sea stranger, that if I found you were a danger to me or  mine, you would meet the Justice of Phutka!\"    \"You did,\" Ross returned. \"And in what way am I now a danger, Captain?\"    \"Kyn Add has been taken by those who are not Wreckers, not Rovers, not  those who serve the Foanna--but strangers out of the sea!\"    Ross could only stare back, confused. And then the full force of his  danger struck home. Who those raiding sea strangers could be, he had no  idea, but that he was now condemned out of his own mouth was true and he  realized that these men were not going to listen to any argument from  him in their present state of mind.    The growl of the crew was that of a hungry animal. Ross saw the wisdom  in Loketh's choice. Far better chance the open sea than the mob before  them.    But his time for choice had passed. Out of nowhere whirled a lacy  gray-white net, slapping him back against a bulkhead to glue him there.  Ross tried to twist loose, got his head around in time to see Loketh  scramble to the top of the rail, turn as if to launch himself at the men  speeding for the now helpless Terran. But the Hawaikan's crippled leg  failed him and he toppled back overside.    \"No!\" Again Torgul's shout halted the crew. \"He shall take the Black  Curse with him when he goes to meet the Shadow--and only one can speak  that curse. Bring him!\"    Helpless, reeling under their blows, dragged along, Ross was thrown into  the Captain's cabin, confronted by a figure braced up by coverings and  cushions in Torgul's own chair.    A woman, her face a drawn death's head of skin pulled tight upon bone,  yet a fiery inner strength holding her mind above the suffering of her  body, looked at the Terran with narrowed eyes. She nursed a bandaged arm  against her, and now and then her mouth quivered as if she could not  altogether control some emotion or physical pain.    \"Yours is the cursing, Lady Jazia. Make it heavy to bear for him as his  kind has laid the burden of pain and remembering on all of us.\"    She brought her good hand up to her mouth, wiping its back across her  lips as if to temper their quiver. And all the time her eyes held upon  Ross.    \"Why do you bring me this man?\" Her voice was strained, high. \"He is not  of those who brought the Shadow to Kyn Add.\"    \"What--?\" Torgul began and then schooled his voice to a more normal  tone. \"Those were from the sea?\" He was gentle in his questioning. \"They  came out of the sea, using weapons against which we had no defense?\"    She nodded. \"Yes, they made very sure that only the dead remained. But I  had gone to the Shrine of Phutka, since it was my day of duty, and  Phutka's power threw its shade over me. So I did not die, but I  saw--yes, I saw!\"    \"Not those like me?\" Ross dared to speak to her directly.    \"No, not those like you. There were few ... only so many--\" She spread  out her five fingers. \"And they were all of one like as if born in one  birth. They had no hair on their heads, and their bodies were of this  hue--\" She plucked at one of the coverings they had heaped around her;  it was a lavender-blue mixture.    Ross sucked in his breath, and Torgul was fast to pounce upon the  understanding he read in the Terran's face.    \"Not your kind--but still you know them!\"    \"I know them,\" Ross agreed. \"They are the enemy!\"    The Baldies from the ancient spaceships, that wholly alien race with  whom he had once fought a desperate encounter on the edge of an unnamed  sea in the far past of his own world. The galactic voyagers were  here--and in active, if secret, conflict with the natives!          11    Weapon from the Depths      Jazia told her story with an attention to time and detail which amazed  Ross and won his admiration for her breed. She had witnessed the death  and destruction of all which was her life, and yet she had the wit to  note and record mentally for possible future use all that she had been  able to see of the raiders.    They had come out of the sea at dawn, walking with supreme confidence  and lack of any fear. Axes flung when they did not reply to the  sentries' challenges had never touched them, and a bombardment of  heavier missiles had been turned aside. They proved invulnerable to any  weapon the Rovers had. Men who made suicidal rushes to use sword or  battle ax hand-to-hand had fallen, before they were in striking  distance, under spraying tongues of fire from tubes the aliens carried.    Rovers were not fearful or easily cowed, but in the end they had fled  from the five invaders, gone to ground in their halls, tried to reach  their beached ships, only to die as they ran and hid. The slaughter had  been remorseless and entire, leaving Jazia in the hill shrine as the  only survivor. She had hidden for the rest of the day, seen the killing  of a few fugitives, and that night had stolen to the shore, launched one  of the ship's boats which was in a cove well away from the main harbor  of the fairing, heading out to sea in hope of meeting the homing  cruisers with her warning.    \"They stayed there on the island?\" Ross asked. That point of her story  puzzled him. If the object of that murderous raid had been only to stir  up trouble among the Hawaikan Rovers, perhaps turning one clan against  the other, as he had deduced when he had listened to Torgul's report of  similar happenings, then the star men should have withdrawn as soon as  their mission was complete, leaving the dead to call for vengeance in  the wrong direction. There would be no reason to court discovery of  their true identity by lingering.    \"When the boat was asea there were still lights at the fairing hall, and  they were not our lights, nor did the dead carry them,\" she said slowly.  \"What have those to fear? They can not be killed!\"    \"If they are still there, that we can put to the test,\" Torgul replied  grimly, and a murmur from his officers bore out his determination.    \"And lose all the rest of you?\" Ross retorted coldly. \"I have met these  before; they can will a man to obey them. Look you--\" He slammed his  left hand flat on the table. The ridges of scar tissue were plain  against his tanned skin. He knew no better way of driving home the  dangers of dealing with the star men than providing this graphic  example. \"I held my own hand in fire so that the hurt of it would work  against their pull upon my thoughts, against their willing that I come  and be easy meat for their butchering.\"    Jazia's fingers flickered out, smoothed across his old scars lightly as  she gazed into his eyes.    \"This, too, is true,\" she said slowly. \"For it was also pain of body  which kept me from their last snare. They stood by the hall and I saw  Prahad, Okun, Mosaji, come out to them to be killed as if they were in a  hold net and were drawn. And there was that which called me also so that  I would go to them though I called upon the Power of Phutka to save. And  the answer to that plea came in a strange way, for I fell as I went from  the shrine and cut my arm on the rocks. The pain of that hurt was as a  knife severing the net. Then I crawled for the wood and that calling did  not come again--\"    \"If you know so much about them, tell us what weapons we may use to pull  them down!\" That demand came from Vistur.    Ross shook his head. \"I do not know.\"    \"Yet,\" Jazia mused, \"all things which live must also die sooner or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19676"],[0,"Shakespeare and Music (#18)"],[1,"name  is inverted, mezzo Passo. Hawkins helps to confuse the matter by  explaining that the Galliard has _five bars or steps_ in the first  strain, and that the Passamezzo has just half that number, and thus  gets its name. No Galliard ever had an uneven number of bars in any of  its strains, so this account is difficult to reconcile.    However, Pass e mezzo, 'step and a half,' is the most trustworthy form  of the name, and the Note on the Orchesographie of Arbeau (1588) makes  all quite clear.    The Passamezzo (or passy-measures pavin) tune in the Appendix has a  similar construction to the ordinary pavan, the form of which has been  explained earlier in this section--_i.e._, it consists of regular  'strains,' which in their turn contain a certain _even_ number of  semibreves, or 'bars.' In the case given, the strains consist of  _eight_ bars each. This must be borne in mind, in connection with Sir  Toby's drunken fancy about the surgeon, in the following passage:--    _Tw._ V, i, 197.         _Sir To._ [Drunk, and with a bloody coxcomb]--Sot, didst see       Dick surgeon, sot?         _Clo._ O! he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were       _set at eight_ i' the morning.         _Sir To._ Then he's a rogue, and a _passy-measures pavin_.    Toby being only moderately sober, naturally feels indignant at the  doctor's indiscretions in the same kind; and, quite as naturally, the  Clown's remark about the latter's eyes brings this fantastic  comparison into his head. The doctor's eyes were set _at eight_, and  so is a Pavan set 'at eight.' It is easy to see Sir Toby's musical  gifts asserting themselves, confused recollections reeling across his  brain, of that old rule in Morley about the right number of semibreves  in a strain, 'fewer then _eight_ I have not seen in any _Pavan_.'  'Also in this you must cast your musicke by _foure_: ... no matter how  manie _foures_ you put in your straine.' Bull's Pavan, 'St Thomas  Wake,' has two strains of _sixteen_ bars each--_i.e._, two 'eights.'  [Appendix.]    The last passage given here shows clearly that the Lavolta and Coranto  were considered exotic in England in Shakespeare's time.    The French ladies here recommend their runaway husbands and brothers  to cross the Channel and try to earn a living by teaching French  dances to the stately English. Probably the \"English dancing-schools\"  in those days would think the solemn walk of the Pavan quite as lively  an amusement as good society could allow. There are other passages too  which show that Shakespeare (or his characters) had a fine 'insular'  feeling against these 'newfangled' fashions from France.    _H. 5._ III, v, 32.         _Bourbon_ (Speaks of the mocking French ladies).            They bid us to the _English dancing-schools_,            And teach _lavoltas high_, and _swift corantos_;            Saying, our grace is only in our heels,            And that we are most lofty runaways.      NOTE ON ARBEAU'S 'ORCHESOGRAPHIE,' 1588.    This interesting book on the Art of Dancing was published at Macon  [Transcriber's Note: corrected from Macon] in 1588. [The date on the  title page is 1589.] The author was Jehan Tabourot, but his real name  does not appear in the work, being anagrammatised into Thoinot Arbeau;  and under the guise of Arbeau he is best known.    The treatise is written (like Morley's Introduction to Practical  Music) in the form of Dialogue between Master (Arbeau) and Pupil  (Capriol); and gives a most clear description of all the fashionable  dances of the time, as far as words can do it; dance tunes in music  type; and incidentally, many instructions as to the manners of good  society.    As much light is thrown upon the dances which are mentioned in  Shakespeare by this book, some of the principal descriptions will be  given here, with the proper music.    On p. 25, Capriol (the Pupil) asks his Master (Arbeau) to describe the  steps of the 'basse' dance. This was the 'danse par bas, ou sans  sauter,' which was of the 15th century, was in triple time, and  contained three parts, A, basse dance; B, Retour de la basse dance;  C, Tordion. This 3rd part, or tordion, 'n'est aultre chose qu'une  gaillarde _par terre_'; _i.e._, the Tordion of a Basse dance was  simply a Galliard _par terre_, without the leaping or 'Sault majeur.'    Before Arbeau answers his pupil, he gives him some preliminary  instruction as to the etiquette of the ball room. He says--'In the  first place ... you should choose some virtuous damsel whose  appearance pleases you (telle que bon vous semblera), take off your  hat or cap in your left hand, and tender her your right hand to lead  her out to dance. She, being modest and well brought up, will give you  her left hand, and rise to follow you. Then conduct her to the end of  the room, face each the other, and tell the band to play a basse  dance. For if you do not, they may inadvertently play some other kind  of dance. And when they begin to play, you begin to dance.'    _Capriol._ If the lady should refuse, I should feel dreadfully  ashamed.    _Arbeau._ A properly educated young lady NEVER refuses one who does  her the honour to lead her out to the dance. If she does, she is  accounted foolish (sotte), for if she doesn't want to dance, what is  she sitting there for amongst the rest?    The Master then gives his pupil an account of the basse dance, the 1st  and 2nd parts of which are composed of various arrangements of the  following movements--         1. La reverence, marked with a big R.         2. Le branle (_not_ the dance of that name), marked with b.         3. Deux simples, marked ss.         4. Le double, marked d.         5. La reprise, marked with a little r.    The 'chanson'--_i.e._, the dance tune, was played on the flute, and  accompanied by the 'tabourin' or drum, which beats all the time. Every  'bar' of the music is called either a 'battement' of the drum, or a  'mesure' of the chanson.    Now Arbeau explains the steps and time of each of the above five  movements.    1. R. This takes four bars. Begin with left foot forward, and in doing  the reverence, half turn your body and face towards the Damoiselle,  and cast on her 'un gracieux regard.'    2. b.[21] Also takes four bars. Keep the feet joined together, then  for the 1st bar, swing the body gently to the left side; 2nd bar,  swing to the right, while gazing modestly upon 'les assistants;' 3rd  bar, swing again to the left; and for the 4th bar, swing to the right  side, looking on the Damoiselle with an 'oeillade defrobee, doulcement  et discretement.'    [Footnote 21: The branle (not the dance, but as used here) is called  _Congedium_ by Anthoine Arena. Arbeau thinks because the dancer  appears about to take leave of his partner--_i.e._, _prendre conge_.  See Hen. VIII., IV. ii. l. 82, stage direction, 'congee.']    3. ss. 1st bar, left foot forward; 2nd bar, bring right foot up to the  said left foot; 3rd bar, advance the right foot; 4th bar, join the  left foot to the said right foot; et ainsi sera parfaict le mouvement  des deux simples.    N.B.--Always suit the length of your steps to the size of the room,  and the convenience of the Damoiselle, who cannot with modesty take  such big steps as you can.    4. d. 1st bar, advance left foot; and, advance right foot; 3rd,  advance left foot; 4th, join right to left. For _two_ doubles (dd) do  it over again, but contrariwise, beginning with the Right foot. For  _three_ doubles (ddd), the form of the third will be, 1st bar, advance  left foot; 2nd, advance right foot; 3rd, advance left foot; 4th, 'puis  tumbera pieds joincts comme a este faict au premier double.' And thus  (he carefully adds) the three doubles are achieved in 12 'battements  et mesures du tabourin.'    5. The Reprise (r) is commonly found before the branle (b), and  sometimes before the double (d) [see the Memoires]. In it you have to  cultivate a certain movement of the knees, or feet, or 'les artoils  seullement,' as if your feet were shaking under you. 1st bar, 'les  artoils' of the right foot; 2nd bar, do.; 3rd bar, of the left foot;  4th, of the right foot again.    The _Memoire_ of the movements of the basse dance--_i.e._, its first  Part, is--         R b ss d r | d r b ss ddd r d r b | ss d r b C.    The C means the 'conge,' or 'leave' which you must take of the  Damoiselle, salute her, and keep hold of her hand, and lead her back  to where you began, in order to dance the Second Part--namely, the  Retour de la basse dance, the _Memoire_ for which is--         b | d r b ss ddd r d r b | C.    [The nine movements enclosed between the upright lines, are the same  in both parts].    Capriol now remarks that he has been counting up, and finds that the  music of the _basse dance_ proper (part 1) has 20 'fours' (vingt  quaternions), and the _retour_ (part 2) has 12 'fours.'    Arbeau then describes the Tordion, which is Part 3 of the basse dance.  He says it is still in triple time, but 'plus legiere et concitee,'  and does not consist of 'simples, doubles, reprises,' etc., like the  first and second parts, but is danced almost exactly as a Galliard,  except that it is _par terre_--_i.e._, without any capers, and low on  the ground, with a quick and light step; whereas the Galliard is  danced _high_, with a slower and weightier 'mesure.'    He gives the following tune, which will fit to _any_ of the  innumerable diversities of Galliard. If played fast, it is a Tordion,  if slower, a Galliard. [There are, of course, no bars in the  original.]    TORDION OR GALLIARD (CINQUEPACE).    [Music]    Here are the Steps of the Galliard, consisting of five movements of  the feet, and the caper, or 'sault majeur.' The five steps give the  Galliard the name of Cinque pas.         1.
