He would then have been of the race connected most closely with the  Master's life. This opinion has been discussed by Woltmann, Holbein's  historian. The superscriptions on the sufficiently numerous letters,  which are reproduced in this painting, must be especially noticed; they  are written in an ancient dialect which seems rather to be that of  central Germany.[8]        Jouin, _Chefs-d'oeuvre: Peinture, Sculpture, Architecture_      (Paris, 1895-97).    FOOTNOTES:    [7] In one corner of the picture is found this inscription with its  Latin distich:              Imaginem Georgii Gysenii    Ista refert vultus, qua cernis Imago Georgi      Sic oculos vivos, sic habet ille genas.             Anno aetatis suae XXXIII.                 Anno dom. 1532.    [8] We read on one of these letters: _Dem erszamen Jergen Gisze to  Lunden in Engelant, mynem broder to handen._          PARADISE    (_TINTORET_)    JOHN RUSKIN      The chief reason why we all know the _Last Judgment_ of Michael Angelo,  and not the _Paradise_ of Tintoret, is the same love of sensation which  makes us read the _Inferno_ of Dante, and not his _Paradise_; and the  choice, believe me, is our fault, not his; some farther evil influence  is due to the fact that Michael Angelo had invested all his figures with  picturesque and palpable elements of effect, while Tintoret has only  made them lovely in themselves and has been content that they should  deserve, not demand, your attention.    You are accustomed to think the figures of Michael Angelo  sublime--because they are dark, and colossal, and involved, and  mysterious--because, in a word, they look sometimes like shadows, and  sometimes like mountains, and sometimes like spectres, but never like  human beings. Believe me, yet once more, in what I told you long  since--man can invent nothing nobler than humanity. He cannot raise his  form into anything better than God made it, by giving it either the  flight of birds or strength of beasts, by enveloping it in mist, or  heaping it into multitude. Your pilgrim must look like a pilgrim in a  straw hat, or you will not make him into one with cockle and nimbus;  an angel must look like an angel on the ground, as well as in the  air; and the much-denounced pre-Raphaelite faith that a saint cannot  look saintly unless he has thin legs, is not more absurd than Michael  Angelo's, that a Sibyl cannot look Sibylline unless she has thick ones.    [Illustration: PARADISE.          _Tintoret._]    All that shadowing, storming, and coiling of his, when you look into it,  is mere stage decoration, and that of a vulgar kind. Light is, in  reality, more awful than darkness--modesty more majestic than strength;  and there is truer sublimity in the sweet joy of a child, or the sweet  virtue of a maiden, than in the strength of Antaeus, or thunder-clouds of  AEtna.    Now, though in nearly all his greater pictures, Tintoret is entirely  carried away by his sympathy with Michael Angelo, and conquers him in  his own field;--outflies him in motion, outnumbers him in multitude,  outwits him in fancy, and outflames him in rage,--he can be just as  gentle as he is strong: and that _Paradise_, though it is the largest  picture in the world, without any question, is also the thoughtfullest,  and most precious.    The Thoughtfullest!--it would be saying but little, as far as Michael  Angelo is concerned.    For consider it of yourselves. You have heard, from your youth up (and  all educated persons have heard for three centuries), of this _Last  Judgment_ of his, as the most sublime picture in existence.    The subject of it is one which should certainly be interesting to you in  one of two ways.    If you never expect to be judged for any of your own doings, and the  tradition of the coming of Christ is to you as an idle tale--still,  think what a wonderful tale it would be, were it well told. You are at  liberty, disbelieving it, to range the fields--Elysian and Tartarean, of  all imagination. You may play with it, since it is false; and what a  play would it not be, well written? Do you think the tragedy, or the  miracle play, or the infinitely Divina Commedia of the Judgment of the  astonished living who were dead;--the undeceiving of the sight of every  human soul, understanding in an instant all the shallow and depth of  past life and future,--face to face with both,--and with God:--this  apocalypse to all intellect, and completion to all passion, this minute  and individual drama of the perfected history of separate spirits, and  of their finally accomplished affections!--think you, I say, all this  was well told by mere heaps of dark bodies curled and convulsed in  space, and fall as of a crowd from a scaffolding, in writhed concretions  of muscular pain?    But take it the other way. Suppose you believe, be it never so dimly or  feebly, in some kind of Judgment that is to be;--that you admit even the  faint contingency of retribution, and can imagine, with vivacity enough  to fear, that in this life, at all events, if not in another--there may  be for you a Visitation of God, and a questioning--What hast thou done?  The picture, if it is a good one, should have a deeper interest, surely  on _this_ postulate? Thrilling enough, as a mere imagination of what is  never to be--now, as a conjecture of what _is_ to be, held the best that  in eighteen centuries of Christianity has for men's eyes been  made;--Think of it so!    And then, tell me, whether you yourselves, or any one you have known,  did ever at any time receive from this picture any, the smallest vital  thought, warning, quickening, or help? It may have appalled, or  impressed you for a time, as a thunder-cloud might: but has it ever  taught you anything--chastised in you anything--confirmed a  purpose--fortified a resistance--purified a passion? I know that for  you, it has done none of these things; and I know also that, for others,  it has done very different things. In every vain and proud designer who  has since lived, that dark carnality of Michael Angelo's has fostered  insolent science, and fleshly imagination. Daubers and blockheads think  themselves painters, and are received by the public as such, if they  know how to foreshorten bones and decipher entrails; and men with  capacity of art either shrink away (the best of them always do) into  petty felicities and innocencies of genre painting--landscapes, cattle,  family breakfasts, village schoolings, and the like; or else, if they  have the full sensuous art-faculty that would have made true painters of  them, being taught from their youth up, to look for and learn the body  instead of the spirit, have learned it and taught it to such purpose,  that at this hour, when I speak to you, the rooms of the Royal Academy  of England, receiving also what of best can be sent there by the masters  of France, contain _not one_ picture honourable to the arts of their  age; and contain many which are shameful in their record of its manners.    Of that, hereafter. I will close to-day by giving you some brief account  of the scheme of Tintoret's _Paradise_, in justification that it is the  thoughtfullest as well as mightiest picture in the world.    In the highest centre is Christ, leaning on the globe of the earth,  which is of dark crystal. Christ is crowned with a glory as of the sun,  and all the picture is lighted by that glory, descending through circle  beneath circle of cloud, and of flying or throned spirits.    The Madonna, beneath Christ, and at some interval from Him, kneels to  Him. She is crowned with the Seven stars, and kneels on a cloud of  angels, whose wings change into ruby fire where they are near her.    The three great Archangels, meeting from three sides, fly  towards Christ. Michael delivers up his scales and sword. He  is followed by the Thrones and Principalities of the Earth; so  inscribed--Throni--Principatus. The Spirits of the Thrones bear scales  in their hands; and of the Princedoms, shining globes: beneath the wings  of the last of these are the four great teachers and lawgivers, St.  Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Gregory, St. Augustine, and behind St.  Augustine stands his mother, watching him, her chief joy in Paradise.    Under the Thrones are set the Apostles, St. Paul separated a little from  the rest, and put lowest, yet principal; under St. Paul, is St.  Christopher, bearing a massive globe, with a cross upon it: but to mark  him as the Christ-bearer, since here in Paradise he cannot have the  child on his shoulders, Tintoret has thrown on the globe a flashing  stellar reflection of the sun round the head of Christ.    All this side of the picture is kept in glowing colour--the four Doctors  of the church have golden mitres and mantles; except the Cardinal, St.  Jerome, who is in burning scarlet, his naked breast glowing, warm with  noble life,--the darker red of his robe relieved against a white glory.    Opposite to Michael, Gabriel flies towards the Madonna, having in his  hand the Annunciation lily, large and triple-blossomed. Above him, and  above Michael equally, extends a cloud of white angels, inscribed  \"Serafini;\" but the group following Gabriel, and corresponding to the  Throni following Michael, is inscribed \"Cherubini.\" Under these are the  great prophets, and singers, and foretellers of the happiness or of the  sorrow of time. David, and Solomon, and Isaiah, and Amos of the  herdsmen. David has a colossal golden psaltery laid horizontally across  his knees;--two angels behind him dictate to him as he sings, looking up  towards Christ; but one strong angel sweeps down to Solomon from among  the cherubs, and opens a book, resting it on the head of Solomon, who  looks down earnestly, unconscious of it;--to the left of David, separate  from the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175"],[0,"The Phantom of the Opera (#18)"],[1," ... What  is this tale about the Angel of Music, which you have been telling  Mamma Valerius?  Some one may have taken you in, played upon your  innocence.  I was a witness of it myself, at Perros ... but you know  what to believe now!  You seem to me quite sensible, Christine.  You  know what you are doing ...  And meanwhile Mamma Valerius lies waiting  for you at home and appealing to your 'good genius!' ... Explain  yourself, Christine, I beg of you!  Any one might have been deceived as  I was.  What is this farce?\"    Christine simply took off her mask and said:  \"Dear, it is a tragedy!\"    Raoul now saw her face and could not restrain an exclamation of  surprise and terror.  The fresh complexion of former days was gone.  A  mortal pallor covered those features, which he had known so charming  and so gentle, and sorrow had furrowed them with pitiless lines and  traced dark and unspeakably sad shadows under her eyes.    \"My dearest!  My dearest!\" he moaned, holding out his arms.  \"You  promised to forgive me ...\"    \"Perhaps! ... Some day, perhaps!\" she said, resuming her mask; and she  went away, forbidding him, with a gesture, to follow her.    He tried to disobey her; but she turned round and repeated her gesture  of farewell with such authority that he dared not move a step.    He watched her till she was out of sight.  Then he also went down among  the crowd, hardly knowing what he was doing, with throbbing temples and  an aching heart; and, as he crossed the dancing-floor, he asked if  anybody had seen Red Death.  Yes, every one had seen Red Death; but  Raoul could not find him; and, at two o'clock in the morning, he turned  down the passage, behind the scenes, that led to Christine Daae's  dressing-room.    His footsteps took him to that room where he had first known suffering.  He tapped at the door.  There was no answer.  He entered, as he had  entered when he looked everywhere for \"the man's voice.\" The room was  empty.  A gas-jet was burning, turned down low.  He saw some  writing-paper on a little desk.  He thought of writing to Christine,  but he heard steps in the passage.  He had only time to hide in the  inner room, which was separated from the dressing-room by a curtain.    Christine entered, took off her mask with a weary movement and flung it  on the table.  She sighed and let her pretty head fall into her two  hands.  What was she thinking of?  Of Raoul?  No, for Raoul heard her  murmur:  \"Poor Erik!\"    At first, he thought he must be mistaken.  To begin with, he was  persuaded that, if any one was to be pitied, it was he, Raoul.  It  would have been quite natural if she had said, \"Poor Raoul,\" after what  had happened between them.  But, shaking her head, she repeated:  \"Poor  Erik!\"    What had this Erik to do with Christine's sighs and why was she pitying  Erik when Raoul was so unhappy?    Christine began to write, deliberately, calmly and so placidly that  Raoul, who was still trembling from the effects of the tragedy that  separated them, was painfully impressed.    \"What coolness!\" he said to himself.    She wrote on, filling two, three, four sheets.  Suddenly, she raised  her head and hid the sheets in her bodice ... She seemed to be  listening ...  Raoul also listened ...  Whence came that strange sound,  that distant rhythm? ... A faint singing seemed to issue from the walls  ... yes, it was as though the walls themselves were singing! ... The  song became plainer ... the words were now distinguishable ... he heard  a voice, a very beautiful, very soft, very captivating voice ... but,  for all its softness, it remained a male voice ... The voice came  nearer and nearer ... it came through the wall ... it approached ...  and now the voice was IN THE ROOM, in front of Christine.  Christine  rose and addressed the voice, as though speaking to some one:    \"Here I am, Erik,\" she said.  \"I am ready.  But you are late.\"    Raoul, peeping from behind the curtain, could not believe his eyes,  which showed him nothing.  Christine's face lit up.  A smile of  happiness appeared upon her bloodless lips, a smile like that of sick  people when they receive the first hope of recovery.    The voice without a body went on singing; and certainly Raoul had never  in his life heard anything more absolutely and heroically sweet, more  gloriously insidious, more delicate, more powerful, in short, more  irresistibly triumphant.  He listened to it in a fever and he now began  to understand how Christine Daae was able to appear one evening, before  the stupefied audience, with accents of a beauty hitherto unknown, of a  superhuman exaltation, while doubtless still under the influence of the  mysterious and invisible master.    The voice was singing the Wedding-night Song from Romeo and Juliet.  Raoul saw Christine stretch out her arms to the voice as she had done,  in Perros churchyard, to the invisible violin playing The Resurrection  of Lazarus.  And nothing could describe the passion with which the  voice sang:    \"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!\"    The strains went through Raoul's heart.  Struggling against the charm  that seemed to deprive him of all his will and all his energy and of  almost all his lucidity at the moment when he needed them most, he  succeeded in drawing back the curtain that hid him and he walked to  where Christine stood.  She herself was moving to the back of the room,  the whole wall of which was occupied by a great mirror that reflected  her image, but not his, for he was just behind her and entirely covered  by her.    \"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!\"    Christine walked toward her image in the glass and the image came  toward her.  The two Christines--the real one and the reflection--ended  by touching; and Raoul put out his arms to clasp the two in one  embrace.  But, by a sort of dazzling miracle that sent him staggering,  Raoul was suddenly flung back, while an icy blast swept over his face;  he saw, not two, but four, eight, twenty Christines spinning round him,  laughing at him and fleeing so swiftly that he could not touch one of  them.  At last, everything stood still again; and he saw himself in the  glass.  But Christine had disappeared.    He rushed up to the glass.  He struck at the walls.  Nobody!  And  meanwhile the room still echoed with a distant passionate singing:    \"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!\"    Which way, which way had Christine gone? ... Which way would she  return? ...    Would she return?  Alas, had she not declared to him that everything  was finished?  And was the voice not repeating:    \"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!\"    To me?  To whom?    Then, worn out, beaten, empty-brained, he sat down on the chair which  Christine had just left.  Like her, he let his head fall into his  hands.  When he raised it, the tears were streaming down his young  cheeks, real, heavy tears like those which jealous children shed, tears  that wept for a sorrow which was in no way fanciful, but which is  common to all the lovers on earth and which he expressed aloud:    \"Who is this Erik?\" he said.        Chapter X  Forget the Name of the Man's Voice      The day after Christine had vanished before his eyes in a sort of  dazzlement that still made him doubt the evidence of his senses, M. le  Vicomte de Chagny called to inquire at Mamma Valerius'.  He came upon a  charming picture.  Christine herself was seated by the bedside of the  old lady, who was sitting up against the pillows, knitting.  The pink  and white had returned to the young girl's cheeks.  The dark rings  round her eyes had disappeared.  Raoul no longer recognized the tragic  face of the day before.  If the veil of melancholy over those adorable  features had not still appeared to the young man as the last trace of  the weird drama in whose toils that mysterious child was struggling, he  could have believed that Christine was not its heroine at all.    She rose, without showing any emotion, and offered him her hand.  But  Raoul's stupefaction was so great that he stood there dumfounded,  without a gesture, without a word.    \"Well, M. de Chagny,\" exclaimed Mamma Valerius, \"don't you know our  Christine?  Her good genius has sent her back to us!\"    \"Mamma!\" the girl broke in promptly, while a deep blush mantled to her  eyes.  \"I thought, mamma, that there was to be no more question of  that! ... You know there is no such thing as the Angel of Music!\"    \"But, child, he gave you lessons for three months!\"    \"Mamma, I have promised to explain everything to you one of these days;  and I hope to do so but you have promised me, until that day, to be  silent and to ask me no more questions whatever!\"    \"Provided that you promised never to leave me again!  But have you  promised that, Christine?\"    \"Mamma, all this can not interest M. de Chagny.\"    \"On the contrary, mademoiselle,\" said the young man, in a voice which  he tried to make firm and brave, but which still trembled, \"anything  that concerns you interests me to an extent which perhaps you will one  day understand.  I do not deny that my surprise equals my pleasure at  finding you with your adopted mother and that, after what happened  between us yesterday, after what you said and what I was able to guess,  I hardly expected to see you here so soon.  I should be the first to  delight at your return, if you were not so bent on preserving a secrecy  that may be fatal to you ... and I have been your friend too long not  to be alarmed, with Mme. Valerius, at a disastrous adventure which will  remain dangerous so long as we have not unraveled its threads and of  which you will certainly end by being the victim, Christine.\"    At these words, Mamma Valerius tossed about in her bed.    \"What does this mean?\" she cried.  \"Is Christine in danger?\"    \"Yes, madame,\" said Raoul courageously, notwithstanding the signs which  Christine made to him.    \"My God!\" exclaimed the good, simple old woman, gasping for"]]]
