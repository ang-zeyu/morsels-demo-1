What the opponents of Mohammad can possibly say against his mission  is his alleged moral declension at Medina.[138] They accuse him of  cruelty[139] and sensuality[140] during his sojourn in that city after  he had passed without any blame more than fifty-five years of his age,  and had led a pious missionary life for upwards of fifteen years. These  moral stains cannot be inconsistent with his office of being a prophet  or reformer. It is no matter if a prophet morally degrades his character  under certain circumstances, or morally degrades his character at the  end of his age--after leading for upwards of fifty-five years a life of  the highest moral principles, and as a paragon of temperance and  high-toned living--while he has faithfully conveyed the message, and has  sincerely and honestly preached religious reforms, and the sublimity of  his preachings have in themselves the marks of divine truth.    If the said prophet defends his stains or immoral deeds by professed  revelations, and justifies himself in his flagrant breaches of morality  by producing messages from heaven, just and equally as he does when he  teaches the purer theology and higher morality for which he is  commissioned, then and from that time only we will consider him as an  impostor, guilty of high blasphemy in forging the name of God for his  licentious self indulgences.    But in the case of Mohammad, in the first place, the charges of cruelty  and sensuality during a period of six or seven years towards the end of  his life, excepting three years, are utterly false; and secondly, if  proved to have taken place, it is not proved that Mohammad justified  himself by alleging to have received a divine sanction or command to the  alleged cruelties and flagrant breaches of morality. The charges of  assassinations and cruelties to the prisoners of war and others, and of  the alleged perfidy and craftiness enumerated by Sir W. Muir, have been  examined and refuted by me in this book. _Vide_ pp. 60-73 and pp. 76-97.  The cases of Maria, a slave-girl, and Zeinab not coming directly under  the object of this book have been treated separately in Appendix B, pp.  211-220 of this work.    Mohammad, in his alleged cruelties towards his enemies, is not  represented by Sir W. Muir to have justified himself by special  revelation or sanction from on high, yet the Rev. Mr. Hughes, whose work  has been pronounced as having \"_the rare merit of being accurate_,\"  makes him (Mohammad) to have done them under the sanction of God in the  Koran.         \"The best defenders of the Arabian Prophet[141] are obliged to       admit that the matter of Zeinab, the wife of Zeid, and again of       Mary, the Coptic slave, are 'an indelible stain' upon his memory;       that he is untrue once or twice to the kind and forgiving       disposition of his best nature; that he is once or twice       unrelenting in the punishment of his personal enemies, and that he       is guilty even more than once of conniving at the assassination of       inveterate opponents; but they do not give any satisfactory       explanation or apology for all this being done _under the supposed       sanction_ of God in the Quran.\"[142]    Such is the rare accuracy of Mr. Hughes' work. It is needless for me to  repeat here that none of these allegations are either true or facts, or  alleged to have been committed under the sanction of God in the Koran.    The Rev. Marcus Dods writes regarding the character of Mohammad:--         \"The knot of the matter lies not in his polygamy, nor even in his       occasional licentiousness, but in the fact that he defended his       conduct, when he created scandal, by professed revelations which       are now embodied as parts of the Koran. When his wives murmured,       and with justice, at his irregularities, he silenced them by a       revelation giving him conjugal allowances which he had himself       proscribed as unlawful. When he designed to contract an alliance       with a woman forbidden to him by his own law, an inspired       permission was forthcoming, encouraging him to the       transgression.\"[143]    Both of these alleged instances given above are mere fabrications. There  was no revelation giving Mohammad conjugal allowances which he had  himself proscribed as unlawful, nor any permission was brought forward  to sanction an alliance forbidden to him by his own law. This subject  has been fully discussed by me in my work \"Mohammad, the True Prophet,\"  and the reader is referred to that work.[144] A few verses on the  marital subject of Mohammad are greatly misunderstood by European  writers on the subject, and Dr. Dods shares the generally wrong idea  when he says:--         \"He rather used his office as a title to license from which       ordinary men were restrained. Restricting his disciples to four       wives, he retained to himself the liberty of taking as many as he       pleased.\" (Page 23.)    This is altogether a gross misrepresentation of the real state of  things. Mohammad never retained to himself the liberty of taking as many  wives as he pleased. On the contrary, Sura XXXIII, 52, expressly forbade  him all women except those he had already with him, giving him no option  to marry in the case of the demise of some or all of them. This will  show that he rather used his office as a restraint against himself of  what was lawful for the people in general to enjoy. The only so-called  privilege above the rest of the believers (Sura XXXIII, 49) was not \"to  retain to himself the liberty of taking as many wives as he pleased,\"  but to retain the wives whom he had already married and whose number  exceeded the limit of four under Sura IV, 3. Other believers having more  wives than four as in the case of Kays, Ghailan, and Naofal, were  requested to separate themselves from the number exceeding the limit  prescribed for the first time. This was before polygamy was declared to  have been virtually abolished, _i.e._, between the publication of _vv._  3 and 128 of Sura IV. There was neither any breach of morality, nor  anything licentious in his retaining the marriages lawfully contracted  by him before the promulgation of Sara IV, 3. Even this privilege (Sura  XXXIII, 49) was counterbalanced by _Ibid_, 52, which runs thus:--         \"Women are not allowed thee hereafter, nor to change them for other       women, though their beauty charm thee, except those already       possessed by thee.\"    Mr. Stanley Lane Poole suffers under the same misrepresentation as other  European writers[145] do when he says that:--         \"The Prophet allowed his followers only four wives, he took more       than a dozen himself.\"    He writes:--         \"When, however, all has been said, when it has been shown that       Mohammad was not the rapacious voluptuary some have taken him for,       and that his violation of his own marriage-law may be due to       motives reasonable and just from his point of view rather than to       common sensuality.\"         \"Did Mohammad believe he was speaking the words of God equally when       he declared that permission was given him to take unto him more       wives, as when he proclaimed, 'There is no god but God?'\"[146]    Mohammad did not violate his own marriage-law, and never pretended that  permission was given to him to take more wives than what was allowed for  other people. All his marriages (which are wrongly considered to have  been about a dozen) were contracted by him before he published the law  unjustly said to have been violated by him. He retained these wives  after the law was promulgated, and their number exceeded four, but he  was interdicted to marry any other women in the place of these in case  of their demise or divorce. Other believers were advised after the  promulgation of the law to reduce the number of their wives exceeding  four, but were at liberty to replace their wives within the limit  assigned in the case of their demise or divorce. Mohammad's case had no  breach of morality or sensual license in it. It was very wise of  Mohammad to retain all the wives he had married before Sura IV, 3, came  into force, for the reason that the wives thus repudiated by him might  have married some of the unbelievers, even some of his enemies, which  would have been derogatory to the Prophet in the eyes of his  contemporaries and a laughing-stock for his enemies.    [Footnote 138: \"We may readily admit that at the first Mahomet did  believe, or persuaded himself to believe, that his revelations were  dictated by a divine agency. In the Meccan period of his life there  certainly can be traced no personal ends or unworthy motives to belie  this conclusion. The Prophet was there, what he professed to be, 'a  simple Preacher and a Warner;' he was the despised and rejected teacher  of a gainsaying people; and he had apparently no ulterior object but  their reformation. Mahomet may have mistaken the right means to effect  this end, but there is no sufficient reason for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20955"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine, Volume 5, No. 1, January, 1852 (#18)"],[1," gun took its name.    The arquebus is mentioned by Philip de Comines, in his account of the  battle of Morat, in 1476. It appears to have been used in England in  1480.    But as yet no improvement had been made by which the soldier was enabled  to take aim. The butt of the arquebus was perfectly straight, and placed  against the breast when the gun was fired. The danger of being knocked  over by the recoil of the piece was great, that of hurting the enemy  very small. The Germans first conceived the idea of bending the butt  downward, and thus elevating the barrel so as to bring it in the range  of the eye. They also sloped it so as to fit the shoulder instead of  being held against the breast. The arquebus constructed in this manner  was used in England in the time of Henry VIII., and was variously called  haquebut, hakebut, hagbut, and hagbus, names all derived from the hooked  shape of the butt. A small sized arquebus, with a nearly semi-circular  butt, and called a demihaque, was probably the origin of the modern  pistol.    [Illustration: JENNINGS'S RIFLE.]    The musket, invented in Spain, was introduced into France in the reign  of Charles IX., by De Strozzi, Colonel-General of the King's infantry,  and thence into England. At first it was so heavy that each musketeer  was accompanied by a boy to assist him in carrying it. It was, however,  soon decreased in weight sufficiently to enable the musketeer to carry  it himself, though it was still so heavy that he could only fire it from  a rest. This rest, which each musketeer carried with him, consisted of a  stick the height of his shoulder, pointed at the lower end, and having  at the upper an iron fork in which the musket barrel was laid. In a  flask the musketeer carried his coarse powder for loading. His fine  powder for priming was in a touch-box. His bullets were in a leathern  bag, shaped much like a lady's work-bag, the strings of which he was  obliged to draw in order to get at them. In his hand were his burning  match and musket rest, and after discharging his piece he was obliged to  defend himself with his sword. The match was fixed to the cock by a kind  of tongs. Over the priming-pan was a sliding cover, which had to be  drawn back with the hand before pulling the trigger. It was necessary to  blow the ashes from the match, and take the greatest care that the  sparks did not fall upon the priming. After each discharge the match had  to be taken out of the cock and held in the hand until the piece was  reloaded; then, in order that it might come down exactly upon the  priming, the greatest care and nicety were required in fitting it again  to the cock. Other inconveniences attended the use of the match-lock  musket. The light of the burning match betrayed the position of the  soldier, and hence it could not be used by sentinels or on secret  expeditions. Various contrivances were resorted to in order to obviate  these difficulties. Walhuysen, a captain of the town of Danzig, in a  treatise entitled _L'Art Militaire pour l'Infantrie_, printed in 1615,  says: \"It is necessary that every musketeer should know how to carry his  match dry in moist or rainy weather, that is, in his pocket or in his  hat, by putting the lighted match between his head and hat, or by some  other means to guard it from the weather. The musketeer should also have  a little tin tube, about a foot long, big enough to admit a match, and  pierced full of little holes, that he may not be discovered by his match  when he stands sentinel or is gone on any expedition.\"    The learned captain does not state whether the hair of those soldiers  who carried their lighted matches between their heads and hats, was  insured. These inconveniences were so great that many able military men  regarded fire-arms as a failure, and recommended a return to the  long-bow, which had been so terrible a weapon in the hands of the  English archers. But the art of war, like every other, never goes  backward, and men were not disposed to abandon the use of so mighty an  agent as gunpowder, merely for the want of some weapon adapted to its  use.    The fire-lock, named from its producing fire by friction, was the first  improvement upon the match-lock. Its earliest form was that known as the  wheel-lock, which is mentioned in a treatise on artillery by Luigi  Collado, printed at Venice in 1586. He says that it had been lately  invented in Germany. This lock consisted of a solid steel wheel, with an  axle, to which was fastened a chain. The axle was turned by a small  lever, and thus winding around it the chain, drew up a very strong  spring. By pulling the trigger the spring was let go, and the wheel  whirled around with great velocity. The cock was so constructed as to  bring a piece of sulphuret of iron down upon the edge of the wheel,  which was notched, and touched the priming in the pan. The friction  produced the sparks. It was from this use that the sulphuret of iron  derived the name of pyrites, or fire-stone. Afterwards a flint or any  common hard pebble was used. The complicated nature of this lock, and  its uncertainty, prevented its general adoption. The next improvement  was due to the Dutch. About the year 1600 there was in Holland a band of  marauders known as _snaphausen_, or _poultry-stealers_. However free  they were in using the property of others, they were yet unable to incur  the expense of the wheel-lock, and the match-lock, by its burning light,  exposed them on their nightly expeditions. The wit which had been  sharpened by laying \"plots\" and \"inductions dangerous\" against  unoffending hens and chickens, was turned to the invention of a gun-lock  better adapted to their purposes. The result of their cogitations was  the lock which, after its inventors, was called the snaphause. It  consisted of a flat piece of steel, furrowed like the edge of the wheel  in the wheel-lock, which was screwed on the barrel beyond the  priming-pan in such a manner as to be movable. By bringing it over the  pan, and pulling the trigger, the flint in the cock struck against the  steel, and the spark was produced. The simplicity and cheapness of this  lock soon rendered it common, and the transition from it to the ordinary  flint-lock followed almost as a matter of course. The last improvement  which we shall notice was the percussion-lock. This is due to the Rev.  Mr. Forsyth, of Belhelvie, in Scotland, though the original form of the  lock has been entirely changed by the introduction of the copper cap.    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF JENNINGS'S BREECH.]    Whilst these improvements were being made in locks, the other parts of  the gun were gradually approaching in lightness, strength, and accuracy  of finish, to the modern standard. The most valuable improvement was the  invention of the rifle barrel. It is mentioned by Pere Daniel, who wrote  in 1693, as being then well known; but the time and place of its origin  has never been ascertained. It was first employed as a military weapon  by the Americans, in the Revolutionary war, and it is in their hands  that it acquired its world-wide reputation.    It would be impossible, in an article like the present, to detail all  the various attempts which have been made, during the last half century,  to increase the efficiency of the rifle. The efforts of scientific men  and mechanics have been constantly directed towards the invention of a  gun which should fire, with the greatest possible rapidity, a number of  times without reloading, and which should possess the indispensable  requisites of safety, durability, and simplicity, both in construction  and in use. Hitherto no invention has combined these advantages in a  sufficient degree to supplant the common rifle.    In our opinion, these ends are all most simply and beautifully attained  by the invention of Mr. Jennings. But of this our readers will be able  to judge for themselves, by the above engravings and the directions for  its use.    [Illustration: CARTRIDGES AND MACHINERY OF JENNINGS'S RIFLES.]    Fill the magazine, on the top of the breech, with percussion pills or  primings, and the tube, under the barrel, with the hollow cartridges  containing gunpowder. Of these cartridges the tube will hold  twenty-four. Place the forefinger in the ring which forms the end of the  lever, _e_, and the thumb on the hammer, elevating the muzzle  sufficiently to let the cartridge nearest the breech slip, by its  gravity, into the carrier _d_; swing the lever forward, and raise the  hammer which moves the breech-pin back, and the carrier up, placing the  cartridge level with the barrel; pull the lever back, and thus force the  breech-pin forward, and shove the cartridge into the barrel, by which  motion a percussion priming is taken from the magazine by means of the  priming-rack _c_, revolving the pinion which forms the bottom of the  magazine, and it also throws up the toggle _a_, behind the breech-pin,  thus placing the piece in the condition to be discharged by a simply  upward pressure of the finger in the ring. After the discharge release  the pressure and repeat the process.    In conclusion, the reader is invited to look at the engraving we have  given of the first gun, and to compare it with the offspring of American  ingenuity we have just described.    Fire-arms are the great pioneers which have opened a way for the  progress of civilized man, and given him victory over the savage beasts  and still more savage men who have opposed his course. Civilization has  in its turn reacted upon fire-arms, and brought them to their present  state of wonderful efficiency.    The heavy match-lock of three centuries ago was almost as dangerous to  him who used it as to the enemy against whom it was directed. It would  be almost impossible for a person to injure himself by the repeating  rifle except by deliberate intention. Skilful military men advised the  abandonment of the match-lock for the bow.
