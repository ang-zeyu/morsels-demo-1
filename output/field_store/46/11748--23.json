Nor are the Persians to be blamed, for there is hardly a nation in  Asia that has suffered more often and in a more shameful manner from  European speculators and adventurers than the land of Iran.    Perhaps the country itself, or rather the people, with their vainglory  and empty pomp, are particularly adapted to be victimised by impostors  and are easy preys to them. Some of the tricks that have been played upon  them do not lack humour. Take, for instance, the pretty farce of the  _Compagnie generale pour l'eclairage et le chauffage en Perse_, which  undertook to light the city of Teheran with no less than one thousand  gas lights. Machinery was really imported at great expense from Europe  for the manufacture of the gas--many of the heavier pieces of machinery  are still lying on the roadside between Resht and Teheran--extensive  premises were built in Teheran itself, and an elaborate doorway with a  suitable inscription on it, is still to be seen; but the most important  part of all--the getting of the coal from which the gas was to be  extracted--had not been considered. The Lalun coal mines, which offered a  gleam of hope to the shareholders, were exploited and found practically  useless. The Company and Government came to loggerheads, each accusing  the other of false dealing, and the result was that the Persians insisted  on the Company lighting up Teheran with the agreed 1,000 lights. If gas  could not be manufactured, oil lights would do. There was the signed  agreement and the Company must stick to it.    The Company willingly agreed, but as the document did not specify the  site where each lamp-post should be situate nearly all were erected, at a  distance of only a few feet from one another--a regular forest of  them--in the two main streets of the European settlement.    One single man is employed after dark to set the lamps alight, and when  he has got to the end of the two streets he proceeds on his return  journey to blow them all out again. By ten o'clock everything is in  perfect darkness.    The Company now claim that they have fulfilled their agreement!    The Belgian Company for the manufacture of Beetroot Sugar was another  example of how speculations sometimes go wrong, and no wonder. In theory  the venture seemed quite sound, for the consumption of sugar in Persia is  large, and if it had been possible to produce cheap sugar in the country  instead of importing it from Russia, France and India, huge profits would  have been probable; but here again the same mistake was made as by the  gas company. The obtaining of the raw material was neglected.    The sugar refinery was built at great cost in this case, too, machinery  was imported to manufacture the three qualities of sugar most favoured by  the Persians--loaf sugar, crystallised sugar, and sugar-candy,--but all  this was done before ascertaining whether it was possible to grow the  right quality of beetroot in sufficient quantities to make the concern  pay. Theoretically it was proved that it would be possible to produce  local sugar at a price which, while leaving the Company a huge profit,  would easily beat Russian sugar, by which French and Indian sugar have  now been almost altogether supplanted.    A model farm was actually started (and is still in existence) near  Shah-Abdul Azim, where beetroot was to be grown in large quantities, the  experts declaring that the soil was better suited for the crop than any  to be found in Europe. Somehow or other it did not answer as well as  expected. Moreover, the question of providing coal for the engines  proved--as in the case of the Gas Company--to be another serious  stumbling block. An attempt to overcome this difficulty by joining with  the Gas Company in working the Lalun Mines was made, but, alas! proved an  expensive failure.    Moreover, further difficulties were encountered in obtaining the right  manure for the beetroots, in order that the acids, which delay  crystallisation, might be eliminated; and the inexperience, carelessness  and reluctance with which the natives took up the new cultivation--and,  as it did not pay, eventually declined to go on with it--render it by no  means strange that the sugar factory, too, which was to make the fortunes  of so many became a derelict enterprise.          CHAPTER XIII         Cash and wealth--Capital as understood by Persians--Hidden       fortunes--Forms of extravagance--Unbusiness-like       qualities--Foreign examples--Shaken confidence of natives in       foreigners--Greed for money--Small merchants--Illicit ways of       increasing wealth--The Persian a dreamer--Unpunctuality--Time no       money and no object--Hindrance to reform--Currency--Gold, silver,       and copper--Absorption of silver--Drainage of silver into       Transcaspia--Banknotes--The fluctuations of the Kran--How the       poorer classes are affected by it--Coins old and new--Nickel       coins--The _Shai_ and its subdivisions.      The Persian does not understand the sound principles on which alone  extensive business can be successful. Partly owing to prevailing  circumstances he is under the misapprehension that hard cash is  synonymous with wealth, and does not differentiate between treasure,  savings, and savings transformed into capital. This is probably the main  cause of the present anaemic state of business in the Shah's Empire.  Thus, when we are told there is in Persia enormous \"capital\" to be  invested, we are not correctly informed. There are \"enormous  accumulations of wealth\" lying idle, but there is no \"capital\" in the  true meaning of the word. These huge sums in hard cash, in jewellery, or  bars of gold and silver, have been hidden for centuries in dark cellars,  and for any good they are to the country and commerce at large might as  well not exist at all.    Partly owing to the covetousness of his neighbours, partly owing to a  racial and not unreasonable diffidence of all around him, and to the fact  that an Asiatic always feels great satisfaction in the knowledge that he  has all his wealth within his own reach and protection, rich men of  Persia take particular care to maintain the strictest secrecy about their  possessions, and to conceal from the view of their neighbours any signs  which might lead them to suspect the accumulation of any such wealth. We  have already seen how even the houses of the wealthiest are purposely  made humble outwardly so as to escape the notice of rapacious officials,  and it is indeed difficult to distinguish from the outside between the  house of a millionaire and that of a common merchant.    The Persian, it must be well understood, does not hide his accumulated  treasure from avaricious reasons; on the contrary, his inclinations are  rather toward extravagance than otherwise, which extravagance he can only  satisfy under a mask of endless lies and subterfuges. No honest ways of  employing his wealth in a business-like and safe manner are open to the  rich Persian under the present public maladministration, nor have the  foreign speculations in the country offered sufficient examples of  success to induce natives to embark upon them again. Far from it; these  enterprises have even made Persians more sceptical and close than before,  and have certainly not shown foreign ways of transacting business at the  best.    That is why, no other way being open to him, the Persian who does wish to  get rid of his wealth, prefers to squander his money, both capital and  income (the latter if he possesses land), in luxurious jewellery and  carpets, and in unhealthy bribery and corruption, or in satisfying  caprices which his voluptuous nature may suggest. The result? The Persian  is driven to live mostly for his vanity and frivolity--two  unbusiness-like qualities not tending to the promotion of commercial  enterprise on a large scale, although it is true that in a small way his  failings give rise and life to certain industries. For instance, even in  remote, poor and small centres where food is scarce and the buildings  humble, one invariably finds a goldsmith, filigree-workers and embroidery  makers, whereas the necessaries of life may be more difficult to obtain.    Of course Persia contains a comparatively small number of Persians of a  more adventurous nature, men who have travelled abroad and have been  bitten with the Western desire for speculation to increase their money  with speed, if not always with safety; but even these men have mostly  retired within their shells since the colossal _fiascos_ of the  speculations started in Persia by foreign \"company promoters.\" A  considerable number of Persians, seduced by glowing prospectuses and  misplaced faith in everything foreign, were dreadfully taken in by the  novel experiments--everything novel attracts the Persian  considerably--and readily unearthed solid gold and silver bars, that had  lain for centuries in subterranean hiding-places, and now came out to be  converted into shares in the various concerns, hardly worth the paper on  which they were printed, but promising--according to the prospectus--to  bring the happy possessors fabulous incomes.    We have seen how the Sugar Refinery, the Glass Factory, the \"Gas\"  Company--a more appropriate name could not have been given--and the  ill-fated Mining Company have created well-founded suspicion of foreign  ways of increasing one's capital, nor can we with any fairness blame the  Persians for returning to their old method of slow accumulation. True  enough, a fortune, if discovered, has a fair possibility of being seized  in the lump by a greedy official, but that is only a possibility;  whereas, when invested in some foreign speculations the loss becomes a  dead certainty! More even than the actual loss of the money, the Persians  who burned their fingers by meddling with foreign schemes felt the scorn  of their friends, of whom they had become the laughing stock.
