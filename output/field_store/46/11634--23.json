All this he took in at a comprehensive glance that consumed no more  time than it had taken him to say good-morning. To that good-morning  Pantaloon replied in a bellow:    \"What the devil are you doing up there?\"    \"Precisely the same thing that you are doing down there,\" was the  answer. \"I am trespassing.\"    \"Eh?\" said Pantaloon, and looked at his companions, some of the  assurance beaten out of his big red face. Although the thing was one  that they did habitually, to hear it called by its proper name was  disconcerting.    \"Whose land is this?\" he asked, with diminishing assurance.    Andre-Louis answered, whilst drawing on his stockings. \"I believe it to  be the property of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\"    \"That's a high-sounding name. Is the gentleman severe?\"    \"The gentleman,\" said Andre-Louis, \"is the devil; or rather, I should  prefer to say upon reflection, that the devil is a gentleman by  comparison.\"    \"And yet,\" interposed the villainous-looking fellow who played  Scaramouche, \"by your own confessing you don't hesitate, yourself, to  trespass upon his property.\"    \"Ah, but then, you see, I am a lawyer. And lawyers are notoriously  unable to observe the law, just as actors are notoriously unable to act.  Moreover, sir, Nature imposes her limits upon us, and Nature conquers  respect for law as she conquers all else. Nature conquered me last night  when I had got as far as this. And so I slept here without regard for  the very high and puissant Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr. At the same time,  M. Scaramouche, you'll observe that I did not flaunt my trespass quite  as openly as you and your companions.\"    Having donned his boots, Andre-Louis came nimbly to the ground in his  shirt-sleeves, his riding-coat over his arm. As he stood there to don  it, the little cunning eyes of the heavy father conned him in detail.  Observing that his clothes, if plain, were of a good fashion, that his  shirt was of fine cambric, and that he expressed himself like a man  of culture, such as he claimed to be, M. Pantaloon was disposed to be  civil.    \"I am very grateful to you for the warning, sir...\" he was beginning.    \"Act upon it, my friend. The gardes-champetres of M. d'Azyr have orders  to fire on trespassers. Imitate me, and decamp.\"    They followed him upon the instant through that gap in the hedge to the  encampment on the common. There Andre-Louis took his leave of them.  But as he was turning away he perceived a young man of the company  performing his morning toilet at a bucket placed upon one of the wooden  steps at the tail of the house on wheels. A moment he hesitated, then he  turned frankly to M. Pantaloon, who was still at his elbow.    \"If it were not unconscionable to encroach so far upon your hospitality,  monsieur,\" said he, \"I would beg leave to imitate that very excellent  young gentleman before I leave you.\"    \"But, my dear sir!\" Good-nature oozed out of every pore of the fat  body of the master player. \"It is nothing at all. But, by all means.  Rhodomont will provide what you require. He is the dandy of the company  in real life, though a fire-eater on the stage. Hi, Rhodomont!\"    The young ablutionist straightened his long body from the right angle in  which it had been bent over the bucket, and looked out through a foam  of soapsuds. Pantaloon issued an order, and Rhodomont, who was indeed as  gentle and amiable off the stage as he was formidable and terrible upon  it, made the stranger free of the bucket in the friendliest manner.    So Andre-Louis once more removed his neckcloth and his coat, and rolled  up the sleeves of his fine shirt, whilst Rhodomont procured him soap,  a towel, and presently a broken comb, and even a greasy hair-ribbon,  in case the gentleman should have lost his own. This last Andre-Louis  declined, but the comb he gratefully accepted, and having presently  washed himself clean, stood, with the towel flung over his left  shoulder, restoring order to his dishevelled locks before a broken piece  of mirror affixed to the door of the travelling house.    He was standing thus, the gentle Rhodomont babbled aimlessly at his  side, when his ears caught the sound of hooves. He looked over his  shoulder carelessly, and then stood frozen, with uplifted comb and  loosened mouth. Away across the common, on the road that bordered it, he  beheld a party of seven horsemen in the blue coats with red facings of  the marechaussee.    Not for a moment did he doubt what was the quarry of this prowling  gendarmerie. It was as if the chill shadow of the gallows had fallen  suddenly upon him.    And then the troop halted, abreast with them, and the sergeant leading  it sent his bawling voice across the common.    \"Hi, there! Hi!\" His tone rang with menace.    Every member of the company--and there were some twelve in all--stood at  gaze. Pantaloon advanced a step or two, stalking, his head thrown back,  his manner that of a King's Lieutenant.    \"Now, what the devil's this?\" quoth he, but whether of Fate or Heaven or  the sergeant, was not clear.    There was a brief colloquy among the horsemen, then they came trotting  across the common straight towards the players' encampment.    Andre-Louis had remained standing at the tail of the travelling  house. He was still passing the comb through his straggling hair,  but mechanically and unconsciously. His mind was all intent upon the  advancing troop, his wits alert and gathered together for a leap in  whatever direction should be indicated.    Still in the distance, but evidently impatient, the sergeant bawled a  question.    \"Who gave you leave to encamp here?\"    It was a question that reassured Andre-Louis not at all. He was not  deceived by it into supposing or even hoping that the business of these  men was merely to round up vagrants and trespassers. That was no part of  their real duty; it was something done in passing--done, perhaps, in the  hope of levying a tax of their own. It was very long odds that they  were from Rennes, and that their real business was the hunting down of  a young lawyer charged with sedition. Meanwhile Pantaloon was shouting  back.    \"Who gave us leave, do you say? What leave? This is communal land, free  to all.\"    The sergeant laughed unpleasantly, and came on, his troop following.    \"There is,\" said a voice at Pantaloon's elbow, \"no such thing as  communal land in the proper sense in all M. de La Tour d'Azyr's vast  domain. This is a terre censive, and his bailiffs collect his dues from  all who send their beasts to graze here.\"    Pantaloon turned to behold at his side Andre-Louis in his shirt-sleeves,  and without a neckcloth, the towel still trailing over his left  shoulder, a comb in his hand, his hair half dressed.    \"God of God!\" swore Pantaloon. \"But it is an ogre, this Marquis de La  Tour d'Azyr!\"    \"I have told you already what I think of him,\" said Andre-Louis. \"As for  these fellows you had better let me deal with them. I have experience  of their kind.\" And without waiting for Pantaloon's consent, Andre-Louis  stepped forward to meet the advancing men of the marechaussee. He had  realized that here boldness alone could save him.    When a moment later the sergeant pulled up his horse alongside of this  half-dressed young man, Andre-Louis combed his hair what time he looked  up with a half smile, intended to be friendly, ingenuous, and disarming.    In spite of it the sergeant hailed him gruffly: \"Are you the leader of  this troop of vagabonds?\"    \"Yes... that is to say, my father, there, is really the leader.\" And he  jerked a thumb in the direction of M. Pantaloon, who stood at gaze out  of earshot in the background. \"What is your pleasure, captain?\"    \"My pleasure is to tell you that you are very likely to be gaoled for  this, all the pack of you.\" His voice was loud and bullying. It carried  across the common to the ears of every member of the company, and  brought them all to stricken attention where they stood. The lot of  strolling players was hard enough without the addition of gaolings.    \"But how so, my captain? This is communal land free to all.\"    \"It is nothing of the kind.\"    \"Where are the fences?\" quoth Andre-Louis, waving the hand that held the  comb, as if to indicate the openness of the place.    \"Fences!\" snorted the sergeant. \"What have fences to do with the matter?  This is terre censive. There is no grazing here save by payment of dues  to the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\"    \"But we are not grazing,\" quoth the innocent Andre-Louis.    \"To the devil with you, zany! You are not grazing! But your beasts are  grazing!\"    \"They eat so little,\" Andre-Louis apologized, and again essayed his  ingratiating smile.    The sergeant grew more terrible than ever. \"That is not the point. The  point is that you are committing what amounts to a theft, and there's  the gaol for thieves.\"    \"Technically, I suppose you are right,\" sighed Andre-Louis, and fell to  combing his hair again, still looking up into the sergeant's face. \"But  we have sinned in ignorance. We are grateful to you for the warning.\"  He passed the comb into his left hand, and with his right fumbled in  his breeches' pocket, whence there came a faint jingle of coins. \"We are  desolated to have brought you out of your way. Perhaps for their trouble  your men would honour us by stopping at the next inn to drink the health  of... of this M. de La Tour d' Azyr, or any other health that they think  proper.\"    Some of the clouds lifted from the sergeant's brow. But not yet all.    \"Well, well,\" said he, gruffly. \"But you must decamp, you understand.\"  He leaned from the saddle to bring his recipient hand to a convenient  distance."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#18)"],[1,"exempting them from appropriation. Bishop Foxe died in London in  May, 1538, and was buried in the Church of St. Mary Monthalt.    *John Skypp*, A.D. 1539-1552. The Archdeacon of Leicester, Edmund Bonner,  was appointed to the see on Foxe's death, but was removed to London before  his consecration, and John Skypp, Abbat of Wigmore, Archdeacon of Dorset,  and chaplain and almoner to Ann Boleyn, became the next Bishop.    He was associated with Cranmer, though, after Cromwell's execution for  high treason in 1540, the Archbishop became distant towards him. He was  the part compiler with Foxe of the _Institution of a Christian Man_,  published in 1537, of the _Erudition_ or _King's Book_, published in 1543,  and was probably one of the committee employed to draw up the first Common  Prayer-Book of Edward VI., in 1548, although, on its completion, he  protested against its publication. He died in 1552 at the episcopal  residence in London.    *John Harley*, A.D. 1553-1554, was appointed by Edward VI. to hold the see  \"during good behaviour.\" He was consecrated on May 26, 1553, but only to  be deposed in March, 1554. Soon after Mary came to the throne, she  appointed a commission of bishops to deprive the bishops appointed during  the reign of her brother. On various charges, and especially on that of  \"inordinate life\" (meaning marriage), the bishopric of Harley was declared  void. He is said to have spent the remainder of his life wandering about  in woods \"instructing his flock, and administering the sacrament according  to the order of the English book, until he died, shortly after his  deposition, a wretched exile in his own land.\"    *Robert Parfew*, A.D. 1554-1557, also known as Wharton, was instituted to  the Hereford See at St. Mary's Church, Southwark, by Lord Chancellor  Gardiner. He had been Abbat of St. Saviour's, Bermondsey, as well as  Bishop of St. Asaph, attended the baptism of Prince Edward, and was one of  those concerned in the production of the _Bishop's Book_. On his death,  September 22, 1537, he bequeathed his mitre and other ornaments to  Hereford Cathedral, though whether he was buried there or in Mold Church  seems doubtful. The Dean of Exeter, Dr. Thomas Reynolds, was appointed to  succeed him, but was imprisoned in the Marshalsea, on the accession of  Elizabeth, before he had been consecrated, and died there in 1559. Fuller,  in his _Church History of Britain_, remarks: \"I take the Marshalsea to be,  in those times, the best for the usage of prisoners, but O the misery of  God's poor saints in Newgate, under Alexander the gaoler! More cruel than  his namesake the coppersmith was to St. Paul; in Lollard's Tower, the  Clink, and Bonner's Coal-house, a place which minded them of the manner of  their death, first kept amongst coals before they were burnt to  ashes.\"(10)    *John Scory*, A.D. 1559-1585, was translated from Chichester. On the  accession of Mary, 1553, he is said to have done penance for his marriage,  and generally reconciled himself with Rome, then to have withdrawn to  Friesland and retracted his recantation, becoming superintendent to the  English congregation there. When Elizabeth came to the throne he returned,  preached before her by appointment in Lent, 1558, was restored to  Chichester, and later on was elected to Hereford.    During his episcopate the persuasive Queen induced Bishop Scory to  surrender to the Crown nine or ten of the best manors belonging to the  see, and to receive in exchange advowsons and other less valuable  possessions. In these transactions it is possible he thought more of his  own interest than that of his successors; in any case, serious charges  were brought against him in other ways. His steward Butterfield drops into  verse on the subject. One of his stanzas runs:--      Then home he came unto our queene, the fyrst year of her raigne,    And byshop was of Hereford, where he doth now remaine;    And where hee hath by enemyes oft, and by false slanderous tongues,    Had troubles great, without desert, to hys continuall wronges.    Bishop Scory was succeeded by *Harberd (or Herbert) Westphaling*, A.D.  1585-1601, Prebendary of Christ Church, Oxford: a man remarkable for the  immoderate length of his speeches, his great integrity, and a profound and  unsmiling gravity. He married a sister of the wife of Archbishop Parker,  and before his election to Hereford was treasurer of St. Paul's and Dean  of Windsor.    According to Sir John Harrington, Bishop Westphaling was once preaching in  his cathedral when a mass of frozen snow fell upon the roof from the  tower, creating a panic among the frightened congregration[**typo:  congregation]. But the Bishop, remaining in his pulpit, exhorted them to  keep their places and fear not. He spent all that he had in revenues from  the see in charity and good works, leaving, says Fuller, \"no great, but a  well-gotten estate, out of which he bequeathed twenty pounds per annum to  Jesus College in Oxford.\" He lies in the north transept of the cathedral,  where his effigy can still be seen.    *Robert Bennett*, A.D. 1602-1617, a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,  was a famous tennis player.    Queen Elizabeth had imprisoned him for a short time for preaching against  her projected marriage with the Duke of Anjou, but made him Dean of  Windsor towards the close of her reign. He is said to have been vain, and  especially fond of having his name and arms carved on house fronts. In  1607 the old quarrel about the Bishop's rights respecting St. Ethelbert's  fair broke out again between the citizens and Bishop Bennett. He spent  large sums on the restoration of the Bishop's Palace. Bishop Bennett was  buried on the north side of the choir, where his tomb remains with effigy.    *Francis Godwin*, A.D. 1617-1633, translated to Hereford from Llandaff,  which preferment he is said to have obtained from the Queen on account of  his commentary _De Praesulibus Angliae_. He also wrote other historical  works, including a life of Queen Mary. To quote again from Fuller, \"He was  stored with all polite learning both judicious and industrious in the  study of antiquity, to whom not only the Church of Llandaff (whereof he  well deserved) but all England is indebted, as for his other learned  writings, so especially for his catalogue of Bishops.\" He was buried at  Whitbourn, in a residence belonging to the see of Hereford, on April 29,  1633.    *William Juxon*, Dean of Worcester, and President of St. John's College,  Oxford, was chosen to follow Bishop Godwin, but before consecration was  called to London. During his episcopacy in that see, he was by Bishop  Laud's procurement made Lord Treasurer of England. Fuller says of his  administration of these duties that \"No hands, having so much money  passing through them, had their fingers less soiled therewith.\"    *Augustine Lindsell*, A.D. 1633-1634, Bishop of Peterborough, was  confirmed on March 24, 1633, but in November of the following year was  found dead in his study.    *Matthew Wren*, A.D. 1635-1635, Dean of Windsor, held a still briefer  episcopate, and in the same year as his consecration to Hereford was  translated to Norwich.    *Theophilus Field*, A.D. 1635-1636, who had been Bishop of Llandaff and of  St. David's, died a year after his translation, and thereby saved the  diocese the ill effects of a longer term of servile and corrupt  management.    *George Coke*, A.D. 1636-1646, Fellow of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, became  Bishop of Bristol in 1633, and was translated to Hereford in 1636. He was  a grave and studious man, and well loved in his diocese, but in the  troubled days of the Civil War was deprived of his see.    *Nicholas Monk*, A.D. 1661-1661, who followed, was brother to the Duke of  Albemarle, and provost of Eton. He died in the December following his  consecration, at Westminster, where he was buried.    *Herbert Croft*, A.D. 1662-1671. The son of Sir Herbert Croft, of an  ancient family in the county of Hereford, he was brought up at Douai and  St. Omer as a Jesuit, but was restored to the English Church through the  influence of Bishop Morton, of Durham. He became a determined opponent of  Romanism, and wrote several treatises against it. About this time there  seems to have been an appeal to the nobility and gentry of the county for  help towards restoring the cathedral. Bishop Croft was buried in the  cathedral, and joined to his gravestone is that of his intimate friend  George Benson, the Dean. He left by his will a sum of money for the relief  of widows, and for apprenticing the sons of clergymen of the diocese.    *Gilbert Ironside*, A.D. 1691-1701, warden of Wadham College, Oxford, was  translated to Hereford from Bristol. He died in London, and was buried in  the church of St. Mary, Monthalt. This church was destroyed in 1863, but  the Rev. F. T. T. Havergal succeeded in getting the Bishop's remains and  tomb-stone removed to Hereford Cathedral a few years later, in 1867.    *Humphrey Humphreys*, A.D. 1701-1712, a Welshman, was translated to  Hereford from Bangor. He is said to have been a good antiquary. Again, in  the early days of the eighteenth century, was the old contest revived  between citizens and Bishop as to his jurisdiction in respect of the fair  of St. Ethelbert. The episcopal rights remained unaltered, at least in  form, down to 1838, when the privileges were taken away by a special Act  of Parliament, and compensation was made to the Bishop for the profits  arising from the fair privileges, to the amount of 12-1/2 bushels of wheat  or its equivalent in money value, according to the price current. This has  now been transferred to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and the fair  limited to two days' duration.    *Philip Bisse*, A.D. 1712-1721, translated from St. David's, was a man of  great munificence, and of the best intentions, of whom it may be said he  spent \"not wisely but too well.\" He was entirely devoid of"]]]
