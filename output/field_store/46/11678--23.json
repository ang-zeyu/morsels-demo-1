Rothenburg on the Tauber is to-day a dead  city to all intents and purposes, affording us a magnificent example  of what a mediaeval town was like, as the bulk of its architecture,  including the circuit of its walls, which remain intact, dates  approximately from the sixteenth century. At present a single line of  railway branching off from the main line with about two trains a day  is amply sufficient to convey the few antiquaries and artists who are  now its sole visitors, and who have to content themselves with  country-inn accommodation. Yet this old free city has actually a  larger population at the present day than it had at the time of which  we are writing, when it was at the height of its prosperity as an  important centre of activity. The figures of its population are now  between 8,000 and 9,000. At the beginning of the sixteenth century  they were between 6,000 and 7,000. A work written and circulated in  manuscript during the first decade of the sixteenth century, \"A  Christian Exhortation\" (_Ein Christliche Mahnung_), after referring to  the frightful pestilences recently raging as a punishment from God,  observes, in the spirit of true Malthusianism, and as a justification  of the ways of Providence, that \"an there were not so many that died  there were too much folk in the land, and it were not good that such  should be lest there were not food enough for all.\"    Great population as constituting importance in a city is  comparatively a modern notion. In other ages towns became famous on  account of their superior civic organization, their more advantageous  situation, or the greater activity, intellectual, political, or  commercial, of their citizens.    What this civic organization of mediaeval towns was, demands a few  words of explanation, since the conflict between the two main elements  in their composition plays an important part in the events which  follow. Something has already been said on this head in the  Introduction. We have there pointed out that the Rath or Town Council,  that is, the supreme governing body of the municipality, was in all  cases mainly, and often entirely, composed of the heads of the town  aristocracy, the patrician class or \"honorability\" (_Ehrbarkeit_), as  they were termed, who on the ground of their antiquity and wealth laid  claim to every post of power and privilege. On the other hand were the  body of the citizens enrolled in the various guilds, seeking, as their  position and wealth improved, to wrest the control of the town's  resources from the patricians. It must be remembered that the towns  stood in the position of feudal over-lords to the peasants who held  land on the city territory, which often extended for many square miles  outside the walls. A small town like Rothenburg, for instance, which  we have described above, had on its lands as many as 15,000 peasants.  The feudal dues and contributions of these tenants constituted the  staple revenue of the town, and the management of them was one of the  chief bones of contention.    Nowhere was the guild system brought to a greater perfection than in  the free Imperial towns of Germany. Indeed, it was carried further in  them, in one respect, than in any other part of Europe, for the guilds  of journeymen (_Cesellenverbaende_), which in other places never  attained any strength or importance, were in Germany developed to the  fullest extent, and of course supported the craft-guilds in their  conflict with the patriciate. Although there were naturally numerous  frictions between the two classes of guilds respecting wages, working  days, hours, and the like, it must not be supposed that there was that  irreconcilable hostility between them which would exist at the present  time between a trade-union and a syndicate of employers. Each  recognized the right to existence of the other. In one case, that of  the strike of bakers towards the close of the fifteenth century, at  Colmar in Elsass, the craft-guilds supported the journeymen in their  protest against a certain action of the patrician Rath, which they  considered to be a derogation from their dignity.    Like the masters, the journeymen had their own guild-house, and their  own solemn functions and social gatherings. There were, indeed, two  kinds of journeymen-guilds: one whose chief purpose was a religious one,  and the other concerning itself in the first instance with the secular  concerns of the body. However, both classes of journeymen-guilds worked  into one another's hand. On coming into a strange town a travelling  member of such a guild was certain of a friendly reception, of  maintenance until he procured work, and of assistance in finding it as  soon as possible.    Interesting details concerning the wages paid to journeymen and their  contributions to the guilds are to be found in the original documents  relating exclusively to the journeymen-guilds, collected by Georg  Schanz.[17] From these and other sources it is clear that the position  of the artisan in the towns was in proportion much better than even that  of the peasants at that time, and therefore immeasurably superior to  anything he has enjoyed since. In South Germany at this period the  average price of beef was about two denarii[18] a pound, while the  daily wages of the masons and carpenters, in addition to their keep and  lodging, amounted in the summer to about twenty, and in the winter to  about sixteen of these denarii. In Saxony the same journeymen-craftsmen  earned on the average, besides their maintenance, two groschen four  pfennige a day, or about one-third the value of a bushel of corn. In  addition to this, in some cases the workmen had weekly gratuities under  the name of \"bathing money\"; and in this connection it may be noticed  that a holiday for the purpose of bathing once a fortnight, once a week,  or even oftener, as the case might be, was stipulated for by the guilds,  and generally recognized as a legitimate demand. The common notion of  the uniform uncleanliness of the mediaeval man requires to be  considerably modified when one closely investigates the condition of  town life, and finds everywhere facilities for bathing in winter and  summer alike. Untidiness and uncleanliness, according to our notions,  there may have been in the streets and in the dwellings in many cases,  owing to inadequate provisions for the disposal of refuse and the like;  but we must not therefore extend this idea to the person, and imagine  that the mediaeval craftsman or even peasant was as unwholesome as, say,  the East European peasant of to-day.    When the wages received by the journeymen artisans are compared with  the prices of commodities previously given, it will be seen how  relatively easy were their circumstances; and the extent of their  well-being may be further judged from the wealth of their guilds,  which, although varying in different places, at all times formed a  considerable proportion of the wealth of the town. The guild system  was based upon the notion that the individual master and workman was  working as much in the interest of the guild as for his own advantage.  Each member of the guild was alike under the obligation to labour, and  to labour in accordance with the rules laid down by his guild, and at  the same time had the right of equal enjoyment with his  fellow-guildsmen of all advantages pertaining to the particular branch  of industry covered by the guild. Every guildsman had to work himself  _in propria persona_; no contractor was tolerated who himself \"in ease  and sloth doth live on the sweat of others, and puffeth himself up in  lustful pride.\" Were a guild-master ill and unable to manage the  affairs of his workshop, it was the council of the guild, and not  himself or his relatives, who installed a representative for him and  generally looked after his affairs. It was the guild again which  procured the raw material, and distributed it in relatively equal  proportions amongst its members; or where this was not the case, the  time and place were indicated at which the guildsman might buy at a  fixed maximum price. Every master had equal right to the use of the  common property and institutions of the guild, which in some  industries included the essentials of production, as, for example, in  the case of the woollen manufacturers, where wool-kitchens,  carding-rooms, bleaching-houses and the like were common to the whole  guild.    Needless to say, the relations between master and apprentices and master  and journeymen were rigidly fixed down to the minutest detail. The  system was thoroughly patriarchal in its character. In the hey-day of  the guilds, every apprentice and most of the journeymen regarded their  actual condition as a period of preparation which would end in the  glories of mastership. For this dear hope they were ready on occasion to  undergo cheerfully the most arduous duties. The education in handicraft,  and, we may add, the supervision of the morals of the blossoming members  of the guild, was a department which greatly exercised its  administration. On the other hand, the guild in its corporate capacity  was bound to maintain sick or incapacitated apprentices and journeymen,  though after the journeymen had developed into a distinct class, and  the consequent rise of the journeymen-guilds, the latter function was  probably in most cases taken over by the latter. The guild laws against  adulteration, scamped work, and the like, were sometimes ferocious in  their severity. For example, in some towns the baker who misconducted  himself in the matter of the composition of his bread was condemned to  be shut up in a basket which was fixed at the end of a long pole, and  let down so many times to the bottom of a pool of dirty water. In the  year 1456 two grocers, together with a female assistant, were burnt  alive at Nuernberg for adulterating saffron and spices, and a similar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#18)"],[1,"and began to burn the houses  they met with little resistance until they came to the convent where  Sister Julie and her companions had a house filled with wounded,  including the wounded chasseurs. The sister met them at the door and  defied them to burn her convent. She ordered them off and made a such a  show of determination that they went. No, they will tell you, these  French people, Sister Julie is not an Amazon. She is a little woman. Her  voice is usually mild and sweet and she smiles all the time. But when  they tried to burn her temporary hospital, it was different. She scared  them off and they did not come back.    Not only that, but she made the Germans carry water and put out the  fires they had started in the neighborhood, and made them fill wash tubs  with water and leave them in her hall, so they would be handy if more  fires threatened.    Besides that, she organized the men and went to the barns where cattle  had been burned and had these dressed and the meat prepared for use.  Then she made great kettles of soup and fed the people who had no homes  and nothing to eat. In all of this she defied the Germans and told their  commander to mind his own business--she was going to attend to hers.  When some of the German soldiers came and wanted to take the food  prepared for the homeless people, Sister Julie ordered them away and  made them go.    There were five other nuns in this convent. Under the leadership of this  heroine they did a tremendous amount of good in the stricken community.  They used the building next door to the convent for a hospital and there  cared for hundreds of wounded soldiers. They assumed charge of the  demoralized town and kept the people from starving. No one gives them  greater credit than Prefect Mirman, who has also done great work in his  department.    We were shown through the convent and hospital under the care of these  sisters, and saw many places where bullets had penetrated the walls,  these were fired by the Germans after they crossed the bridge. In this  hospital the sisters cared for the German wounded as tenderly as for the  French, and they won the respect of the invaders in this way, otherwise  it would have probably been impossible for them to do the work they did.  We saw the camp chair on which Sister Julie sat all night in front of  the hospital and kept the Germans out.    The Commission spent the greater part of the day in Gerbeviller,  visiting the bridge where the seventy-five chasseurs held up the German  advance, as well as that where one lone chasseur--a regular \"Horatio at  the Bridge\", kept back the attacking party at the Chateau.    We went through this chateau, which is owned by a resident of Paris and  was one of the sights of the village. It is seven or eight hundred years  old and is a very large building, handsomely finished in the interior.  Before the bombardment, which was a ruthless and unnecessary piece of  vandalism, it contained many fine tapestries and countless precious  heirlooms of the Bourbon times. The great strength of the walls resisted  the effects of artillery, but the interior was entirely ruined by fire.  The grand marble staircase was splintered, but the Bourbon coat of arms  above it was not touched. Strewn about in corners and on the floors were  fragments of vases and art work that must have been priceless. Even  these fragments were valuable. We secured a number of small pieces, some  of which I brought home as relics.    While viewing the ruins of the chateau we could hear the guns booming.  It was while we were still here that we received news that bombs had  been dropped on Belfort that morning, twenty-four hours after we left  that place, and that a number of persons had been killed, among them  some women and children.    Gerbeviller is an almost complete ruin. Beyond the convent and hospital,  and a few buildings saved for headquarters for the commanding general by  the Germans, all the rest of the town was destroyed. The people who  remain there are living in temporary buildings or mere sheds built on  the ruins of their homes, which they do not want to leave under any  circumstances. This little town, which has won its place in history, was  one of the most interesting and melancholy sights we saw in all France.    On the following day, Saturday, October 7th, we visited the villages of  Luneville and Vitrimont. We were now in the \"devastated region\" for  sure. On every hand was evidence of the ruin wrought by shells, with  long lines of trenches that had once been filled with soldiers. Some of  these were green again, but the trees presented a woeful appearance.    The next stop after leaving Rambevillers was the little town of  Vitrimont. This is a small village in France, almost wholly ruined by  the Germans in 1914, preceding the battle of the Marne. We found there  Miss Daisy Polk, of San Francisco, a wealthy, young and attractive  woman, whose work is being financed largely by the Crockers, of San  Francisco.    She is living in one of the small houses untouched by the Germans. She  has undertaken the rebuilding of the village of Vitrimont as a modern  sanitary proposition and to serve as a model for what may be done in  rebuilding all the destroyed parts of France. She is the  great-granddaughter of President Polk. It is a splendid work and should  receive support.    I have since received the following letter from Miss Polk:    * * *    Vitrimont, par Luneville, Meurthe et  Moselle, France.  October 18th, 1916    Dear Mr. Butler:--    Your note, with the Commission booklet, received and I want to  thank you for remembering me. The visit of the Industrial  Commission was a most delightful surprise to me here in the midst  of my ruins and it is very nice to have a souvenir--especially such  a nice souvenir, with all the names and photographs.    Vitrimont looks very much as it did when you were here except that  the work is a little more advanced in spite of the rain. We are not  hoping any longer that the war will end this winter--so we are sad.  Especially when we have to see our men go back to the front after  their all too short leaves. This has happened three times since you  were here, all three going back to the Somme, too, which they all  say is much worse than Verdun ever was. However, they have the  satisfaction, as one of our men said today, (a fine industrious  farmer) of hoping that if they don't come back, at least their  wives and children will have their homes rebuilt. This is my hope  too. Thanking you again for your letter.    Very sincerely yours,    (Signed) DAISY POLK.    * * *    Miss Polk is a most charming young woman, filled with enthusiasm. She  lives in a small house with but two rooms.          XIV.    ON THE MAIN FRONT      We arrived at Nancy October 7th, at six o'clock P. M. and spent the  evening at a reception given by the Prefect L. Mirman. We met here Madam  Mirman and her two daughters. In the entrance to the prefect's residence  were several large holes which had been blown out by the German shells.  During the reception we were shown an embroidered sheet, filled with  holes. This was taken from the window of a hospital, fired on by the  Germans, July, 1916. The name of the hospital was Point Au Mousson. The  sheet was hanging in a window when the shrapnel was fired into it. This  was considered ample proof that the hospital was fired upon with the  full knowledge that it was a hospital.    This visit to prefect Mirman's home was a red letter event in our trip.  He is one of the important men of France and is devoting much of his  time to the care of refugees and other good work.    As we stopped at the entrance of Nancy, we saw an aeroplane flying over  the town. This aeroplane was intended to convoy us to our destination.    Next day we were driven to the village of Luneville. At this place, as  in nearly all the towns of France, there is a public market house, with  stalls usually presided over by women. Late in September the Germans  dropped from aeroplanes a number of bombs on this market house. The  entire building was destroyed and forty-one women killed, besides a  number of children who were playing about. We saw the ruins of the  market house. This sort of battle waging is called \"German terrorism\",  otherwise, a \"stepping stone to kultur\".    There is an immense palace in Luneville called the Palace of Stanislaus,  occupied by a former King of Poland.    Our headquarters were at Nancy, where we remained for two days. We were  shown every possible attention by the prefect and under his guidance  visited various parts of the city. Among other places \"The Golden Gates\"  of Louis XVI and the gate of the old town erected in 1336. We visited  the park and were shown a hole where a German shell had penetrated, the  hole being fully fifty feet deep. We visited the cathedral of St. Elme  and were shown where the beautiful stained glass had been blown out of  the windows. We visited the Ducal Chapel, which dates back to the Tenth  century, where the princes of the House of Hapsburg are entombed. Sand  bags were piled up everywhere to prevent further ruin to this ancient  place. We were shown the ruins of the cooking school reported by  German aviators as a military building and for that reason destroyed.    [Illustration: Cathedral at Nancy.]    Practically one-half of the town is in ruins. The military barracks are  now used for housing and caring for refugees from all over France and  this is done with great system. The expense is figured down to one franc  per day for each person. We saw there a children's school, playground,  orphanage and Cinema show, and attended church services at which were  present several thousand refugees. We could hear the cannon booming  during the entire services. Many of the refugees were at work making  bags for the trenches and embroidering. We visited the museum and were  shown tombs and urns dating back to the"]]]
