IX.--The ninth principle of Baha'u'llah is:    That Religion should not concern itself with Political Questions    Religion is concerned with things of the spirit, politics with things of  the world. Religion has to work with the world of thought, whilst the  field of politics lies with the world of external conditions.    It is the work of the clergy to educate the people, to instruct them, to  give them good advice and teaching so that they may progress spiritually.  With political questions they have nothing to do.    X.--The tenth principle of Baha'u'llah is:    Education and Instruction of Women    Women have equal rights with men upon earth; in religion and society they  are a very important element. As long as women are prevented from  attaining their highest possibilities, so long will men be unable to  achieve the greatness which might be theirs.    XI.--The eleventh principle of Baha'u'llah is:    The Power of the Holy Spirit, by which alone Spiritual Development is  achieved    It is only by the breath of the Holy Spirit that spiritual development can  come about. No matter how the material world may progress, no matter how  splendidly it may adorn itself, it can never be anything but a lifeless  body unless the soul is within, for it is the soul that animates the body;  the body alone has no real significance. Deprived of the blessings of the  Holy Spirit the material body would be inert.    Here are, very briefly explained, some of the principles of Baha'u'llah.    In short, it behoves us all to be lovers of truth. Let us seek her in  every season and in every country, being careful never to attach ourselves  to personalities. Let us see the light wherever it shines, and may we be  enabled to recognize the light of truth no matter where it may arise. Let  us inhale the perfume of the rose from the midst of thorns which surround  it; let us drink the running water from every pure spring.    Since I arrived in Paris, it has given me much pleasure to meet such  Parisians as you are, for praise be to God, you are intelligent,  unprejudiced, and you long to know the truth. You have in your hearts the  love of humanity, and as far as you are able, you exert yourselves in the  cause of charitable work and in the bringing about of unity; this is  especially what Baha'u'llah desired.    It is for this reason that I am so happy to be among you, and I pray for  you, that you may be receptacles for the Blessings of God, and that you  may be the means of spreading spirituality throughout this country.    You already have a wonderful material civilization and in like manner  shall spiritual civilization be yours.    Monsieur Bleck thanked 'Abdu'l-Baha, and he replied:    'I am very grateful to you for the kind sentiments which you have just  uttered. I hope that these two movements will ere long be spread all over  the earth. Then will the unity of humanity have pitched its tent in the  centre of the world.'          THE FIRST PRINCIPLE--SEARCH AFTER TRUTH      4 Avenue de Camoeens, Paris  November 10th    The first principle of the Teaching of Baha'u'llah is:    The Search after Truth    If a man would succeed in his search after truth, he must, in the first  place, shut his eyes to all the traditional superstitions of the past.    The Jews have traditional superstitions, the Buddhists and the  Zoroastrians are not free from them, neither are the Christians! All  religions have gradually become bound by tradition and dogma.    All consider themselves, respectively, the only guardians of the truth,  and that every other religion is composed of errors. They themselves are  right, all others are wrong! The Jews believe that they are the only  possessors of the truth and condemn all other religions. The Christians  affirm that their religion is the only true one, that all others are  false. Likewise the Buddhists and Muhammadans; all limit themselves. If  all condemn one another, where shall we search for truth? All  contradicting one another, all cannot be true. If each believe his  particular religion to be the only true one, he blinds his eyes to the  truth in the others. If, for instance, a Jew is bound by the external  practice of the religion of Israel, he does not permit himself to perceive  that truth can exist in any other religion; it must be all contained in  his own!    We should, therefore, detach ourselves from the external forms and  practices of religion. We must realize that these forms and practices,  however beautiful, are but garments clothing the warm heart and the living  limbs of Divine truth. We must abandon the prejudices of tradition if we  would succeed in finding the truth at the core of all religions. If a  Zoroastrian believes that the Sun is God, how can he be united to other  religions? While idolaters believe in their various idols, how can they  understand the oneness of God?    It is, therefore, clear that in order to make any progress in the search  after truth we must relinquish superstition. If all seekers would follow  this principle they would obtain a clear vision of the truth.    If five people meet together to seek for truth, they must begin by cutting  themselves free from all their own special conditions and renouncing all  preconceived ideas. In order to find truth we must give up our prejudices,  our own small trivial notions; an open receptive mind is essential. If our  chalice is full of self, there is no room in it for the water of life. The  fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else wrong is the  greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity, and unity is  necessary if we would reach truth, for truth is one.    Therefore it is imperative that we should renounce our own particular  prejudices and superstitions if we earnestly desire to seek the truth.  Unless we make a distinction in our minds between dogma, superstition and  prejudice on the one hand, and truth on the other, we cannot succeed. When  we are in earnest in our search for anything we look for it everywhere.  This principle we must carry out in our search for truth.    Science must be accepted. No one truth can contradict another truth. Light  is good in whatsoever lamp it is burning! A rose is beautiful in  whatsoever garden it may bloom! A star has the same radiance if it shines  from the East or from the West. Be free from prejudice, so will you love  the Sun of Truth from whatsoever point in the horizon it may arise! You  will realize that if the Divine light of truth shone in Jesus Christ it  also shone in Moses and in Buddha. The earnest seeker will arrive at this  truth. This is what is meant by the 'Search after Truth'.    It means, also, that we must be willing to clear away all that we have  previously learned, all that would clog our steps on the way to truth; we  must not shrink if necessary from beginning our education all over again.  We must not allow our love for any one religion or any one personality to  so blind our eyes that we become fettered by superstition! When we are  freed from all these bonds, seeking with liberated minds, then shall we be  able to arrive at our goal.    'Seek the truth, the truth shall make you free.' So shall we see the truth  in all religions, for truth is in all and truth is one!          THE SECOND PRINCIPLE--THE UNITY OF MANKIND      November 11th    I spoke yesterday of the first principle of the Teaching of Baha'u'llah,  'The Search for Truth'; how it is necessary for a man to put aside all in  the nature of superstition, and every tradition which would blind his eyes  to the existence of truth in all religions. He must not, while loving and  clinging to one form of religion, permit himself to detest all others. It  is essential that he search for truth in all religions, and, if his  seeking be in earnest, he will assuredly succeed.    Now the first discovery which we make in our 'Search after Truth', will  lead us to the second principle, which is the 'Unity of Mankind'. All men  are servants of the One God. One God reigns over all the nations of the  world and has pleasure in all His children. All men are of one family; the  crown of humanity rests on the head of every human being.    In the eyes of the Creator all His children are equal; His goodness is  poured forth on all. He does not favour this nation nor that nation, all  alike are His creatures. This being so, why should we make divisions,  separating one race from another? Why should we create barriers of  superstition and tradition bringing discord and hatred among the people?    The only difference between members of the human family is that of degree.  Some are like children who are ignorant, and must be educated until they  arrive at maturity. Some are like the sick and must be treated with  tenderness and care. None are bad or evil! We must not be repelled by  these poor children. We must treat them with great kindness, teaching the  ignorant and tenderly nursing the sick.    Consider: Unity is necessary to existence. Love is the very cause of life;  on the other hand, separation brings death. In the world of material  creation, for instance, all things owe their actual life to unity. The  elements which compose wood, mineral, or stone, are held together by the  law of attraction. If this law should cease for one moment to operate  these elements would not hold together, they would fall apart, and the  object would in that particular form cease to exist. The law of attraction  has brought together certain elements in the form of this beautiful  flower, but when that attraction is withdrawn from this centre the flower  will decompose, and, as a flower, cease to exist.    So it is with the great body of humanity. The wonderful Law of Attraction,  Harmony and Unity, holds together this marvellous Creation.    As with the whole, so with the parts; whether a flower or a human body,  when the attracting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19285"],[0,"The Promulgation of Universal Peace (#18)"],[1,"with the  intellect and the power of reason, it is surely superstition.    At another time I shall speak further of the principles revealed in the  teachings of Baha'u'llah.            TALKS 'ABDU'L-BAHA DELIVERED IN CHICAGO, WILMETTE, AND EVANSTON          30 April 1912  Talk at Public Meeting Concluding Convention of Baha'i Temple Unity  Drill Hall, Masonic Temple, Chicago, Illinois      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    Among the institutes of the Holy Books is that of the foundation of places  of worship. That is to say, an edifice or temple is to be built in order  that humanity might find a place of meeting, and this is to be conducive  to unity and fellowship among them. The real temple is the very Word of  God; for to it all humanity must turn, and it is the center of unity for  all mankind. It is the collective center, the cause of accord and  communion of hearts, the sign of the solidarity of the human race, the  source of eternal life. Temples are the symbols of the divine uniting  force so that when the people gather there in the House of God they may  recall the fact that the law has been revealed for them and that the law  is to unite them. They will realize that just as this temple was founded  for the unification of mankind, the law preceding and creating it came  forth in the manifest Word. Jesus Christ, addressing Peter, said, \"Thou  art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.\" This utterance was  indicative of the faith of Peter, signifying: This faith of thine, O  Peter, is the very cause and message of unity to the nations; it shall be  the bond of union between the hearts of men and the foundation of the  oneness of the world of humanity. In brief, the original purpose of  temples and houses of worship is simply that of unity--places of meeting  where various peoples, different races and souls of every capacity may  come together in order that love and agreement should be manifest between  them. That is why Baha'u'llah has commanded that a place of worship be  built for all the religionists of the world; that all religions, races and  sects may come together within its universal shelter; that the  proclamation of the oneness of mankind shall go forth from its open courts  of holiness--the announcement that humanity is the servant of God and that  all are submerged in the ocean of His mercy. It is the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar. The world of existence may be likened to this  temple and place of worship. For just as the external world is a place  where the people of all races and colors, varying faiths, denominations  and conditions come together--just as they are submerged in the same sea of  divine favors--so, likewise, all may meet under the dome of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar and adore the one God in the same spirit of truth;  for the ages of darkness have passed away, and the century of light has  come. Ignorant prejudices are being dispelled, and the light of unity is  shining. The differences existing between nations and peoples will soon be  annulled, and the fundamentals of the divine religions, which are no other  than the oneness and solidarity of the human race, are being established.  For thousands of years the human race has been at war. It is enough. Now  let mankind, for a time at least, consort in amity and peace. Enmity and  hatred have ruled. Let the world, for a period, exercise love. For  thousands of years the nations have denied each other, considering each  other as infidel and inferior. It is sufficient. We must now realize that  we are the servants of one God, that we turn to one beneficent Father,  live under one divine law, seek one reality and have one desire. Thus may  we live in the utmost friendship and love, and in return the favors and  bounties of God shall surround us; the world of humanity will be reformed;  mankind, enjoy a new life; eternal light will illumine, and heavenly  moralities become manifest.    Then divine policy shall govern the world, for the divine policy is the  oneness of humanity. God is just and kind to all. He considers all as His  servants. He excludes none, and His judgments are correct and true. No  matter how complete human policy and foresight may appear, they are  imperfect. If we do not seek the counsel of God or if we refuse to follow  His dictates, it is presumptive evidence that we are knowing and wise,  whereas God is ignorant; that we are sagacious and God is not. God forbid!  We seek shelter in His mercy for this suggestion! No matter how far the  human intelligence may advance, it is still but a drop, while divine  omniscience is the ocean. Shall we say that a drop is imbued or endowed  with qualities of which the ocean is devoid? Shall we believe that the  policy and plan of this atom of a human soul are superior to the wisdom of  the Omniscient? There is no greater ignorance than this. Briefly, some are  mere children; with the utmost love we must educate them to make them  wise. Others are sick and ailing; we must tenderly treat them until they  recover. Some have unworthy morals; we must train them toward the standard  of true morality. Other than this we are all the servants of one God and  under the providence and protection of one Father.    These are the institutions of God and the foundations of His temple, the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar. The outer edifice is a symbol of the inner. May the  people be admonished thereby.    I pray in your behalf that your hearts may be enlightened with the light  of the love of God; that your minds may develop daily; that your spirits  may become aglow with the fire and illumination of His glad tidings, until  these divine foundations may become established throughout the human  world. The first of these institutions and foundations is the oneness of  humanity and love among mankind. The second is the Most Great Peace.  Praise be to God! This American democracy manifests capacity, showing  forth readiness to become the standard-bearer of the Most Great Peace. May  its hosts be the hosts of the oneness of humanity. May they serve the  threshold of God and spread the message of the good pleasure of God.    O Thou kind Lord! This gathering is turning to Thee. These hearts are  radiant with Thy love. These minds and spirits are exhilarated by the  message of Thy glad tidings. O God! Let this American democracy become  glorious in spiritual degrees even as it has aspired to material degrees,  and render this just government victorious. Confirm this revered nation to  upraise the standard of the oneness of humanity, to promulgate the Most  Great Peace, to become thereby most glorious and praiseworthy among all  the nations of the world. O God! This American nation is worthy of Thy  favors and is deserving of Thy mercy. Make it precious and near to Thee  through Thy bounty and bestowal.          30 April 1912  Talk at Hull House  Chicago, Illinois      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    When we view the world of creation, we find that all living things may be  classified under two aspects of existence. First, they possess bodies  composed of material substance common to all--whether vegetable, animal or  human. This is their point of agreement or, as it is philosophically  termed, their point of contact. Second, they vary and differ from each  other in degree and function--that is to say, in their respective kingdoms.  This is their point of distinction and differentiation. For instance, the  vegetable and animal are alike in the fact that their bodies are composed  of the same material elements but widely different in their kingdoms and  powers. Man is like the animal in physical structure but otherwise  immeasurably separated and superior.    In the human kingdom itself there are points of contact, properties common  to all mankind; likewise, there are points of distinction which separate  race from race, individual from individual. If the points of contact,  which are the common properties of humanity, overcome the peculiar points  of distinction, unity is assured. On the other hand, if the points of  differentiation overcome the points of agreement, disunion and weakness  result. One of the important questions which affect the unity and the  solidarity of mankind is the fellowship and equality of the white and  colored races. Between these two races certain points of agreement and  points of distinction exist which warrant just and mutual consideration.  The points of contact are many; for in the material or physical plane of  being, both are constituted alike and exist under the same law of growth  and bodily development. Furthermore, both live and move in the plane of  the senses and are endowed with human intelligence. There are many other  mutual qualifications. In this country, the United States of America,  patriotism is common to both races; all have equal rights to citizenship,  speak one language, receive the blessings of the same civilization, and  follow the precepts of the same religion. In fact numerous points of  partnership and agreement exist between the two races; whereas the one  point of distinction is that of color. Shall this, the least of all  distinctions, be allowed to separate you as races and individuals? In  physical bodies, in the law of growth, in sense endowment, intelligence,  patriotism, language, citizenship, civilization and religion you are one  and the same. A single point of distinction exists--that of racial color.  God is not pleased with--neither should any reasonable or intelligent man  be willing to recognize--inequality in the races because of this  distinction.    But there is need of a superior power to overcome human prejudices, a  power which nothing in the world of mankind can withstand and which will  overshadow the effect of all other forces at work in human conditions.  That irresistible power is the love of God. It is my hope and prayer that  it may destroy the prejudice of this one point of distinction between you  and unite you all"]]]
