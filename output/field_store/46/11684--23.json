Look at it, will you?\"    As near as we could ascertain, it was three hundred feet from the  ground below, five hundred from the rim wall above, and could not  possibly have been approached from the top. Moreover, the cliff wall  was as smooth as a wall of human make.    \"There's another one,\" called out Jones.    \"Yes, and I see another; no doubt there are many of them,\" replied  Wallace. \"In my mind, only one thing possible accounts for their  position. You observe they appear to be about level with each other.  Well, once the Canyon floor ran along that line, and in the ages gone  by it has lowered, washed away by the rains.\"    This conception staggered us, but it was the only one conceivable. No  doubt we all thought at the same time of the little rainfall in that  arid section of Arizona.    \"How many years?\" queried Jones.    \"Years! What are years?\" said Wallace. \"Thousands of years, ages have  passed since the race who built these tombs lived.\"    Some persuasion was necessary to drag our scientific friend from the  spot, where obviously helpless to do anything else, he stood and gazed  longingly at the isolated tombs. The canyon widened as we proceeded;  and hundreds of points that invited inspection, such as overhanging  shelves of rock, dark fissures, caverns and ruins had to be passed by,  for lack of time.    Still, a more interesting and important discovery was to come, and the  pleasure and honor of it fell to me. My eyes were sharp and peculiarly  farsighted--the Indian sight, Jones assured me; and I kept them  searching the walls in such places as my companions overlooked.  Presently, under a large, bulging bluff, I saw a dark spot, which took  the shape of a figure. This figure, I recollected, had been presented  to my sight more than once, and now it stopped me. The hard climb up  the slippery stones was fatiguing, but I did not hesitate, for I was  determined to know. Once upon the ledge, I let out a yell that quickly  set my companions in my direction. The figure I had seen was a dark,  red devil, a painted image, rude, unspeakably wild, crudely executed,  but painted by the hand of man. The whole surface of the cliff wall  bore figures of all shapes--men, mammals, birds and strange devices,  some in red paint, mostly in yellow. Some showed the wear of time;  others were clear and sharp.    Wallace puffed up to me, but he had wind enough left for another whoop.  Jones puffed up also, and seeing the first thing a rude sketch of what  might have been a deer or a buffalo, he commented thus: \"Darn me if I  ever saw an animal like that? Boys, this is a find, sure as you're  born. Because not even the Piutes ever spoke of these figures. I doubt  if they know they're here. And the cowboys and wranglers, what few ever  get by here in a hundred years, never saw these things. Beats anything  I ever saw on the Mackenzie, or anywhere else.\"    The meaning of some devices was as mystical as that of others was  clear. Two blood-red figures of men, the larger dragging the smaller by  the hair, while he waved aloft a blood-red hatchet or club, left little  to conjecture. Here was the old battle of men, as old as life. Another  group, two figures of which resembled the foregoing in form and action,  battling over a prostrate form rudely feminine in outline, attested to  an age when men were as susceptible as they are in modern times, but  more forceful and original. An odd yellow Indian waved aloft a red  hand, which striking picture suggested the idea that he was an ancient  Macbeth, listening to the knocking at the gate. There was a character  representing a great chief, before whom many figures lay prostrate,  evidently slain or subjugated. Large red paintings, in the shape of  bats, occupied prominent positions, and must have represented gods or  devils. Armies of marching men told of that blight of nations old or  young--war. These, and birds unnamable, and beasts unclassable, with  dots and marks and hieroglyphics, recorded the history of a bygone  people. Symbols they were of an era that had gone into the dim past,  leaving only these marks, {Symbols recording the history of a bygone  people.} forever unintelligible; yet while they stood, century after  century, ineffaceable, reminders of the glory, the mystery, the sadness  of life.    \"How could paint of any kind last so long? asked Jones, shaking his  head doubtfully.    \"That is the unsolvable mystery,\" returned Wallace. \"But the records  are there. I am absolutely sure the paintings are at least a thousand  years old. I have never seen any tombs or paintings similar to them.  Snake Gulch is a find, and I shall some day study its wonders.\"    Sundown caught us within sight of Oak Spring, and we soon trotted into  camp to the welcoming chorus of the hounds. Frank and the others had  reached the cabin some hours before. Supper was steaming on the hot  coals with a delicious fragrance.    Then came the pleasantest time of the day, after a long chase or  jaunt--the silent moments, watching the glowing embers of the fire; the  speaking moments when a red-blooded story rang clear and true; the  twilight moments, when the wood-smoke smelled sweet.    Jones seemed unusually thoughtful. I had learned that this  preoccupation in him meant the stirring of old associations, and I  waited silently. By and by Lawson snored mildly in a corner; Jim and  Frank crawled into their blankets, and all was still. Wallace smoked  his Indian pipe and hunted in firelit dreams.    \"Boys,\" said our leader finally, \"somehow the echoes dying away in that  cave reminded me of the mourn of the big white wolves in the Barren  Lands.\"    Wallace puffed huge clouds of white smoke, and I waited, knowing that I  was to hear at last the story of the Colonel's great adventure in the  Northland.        CHAPTER 8.    NAZA! NAZA! NAZA!    It was a waiting day at Fort Chippewayan. The lonesome, far-northern  Hudson's Bay Trading Post seldom saw such life. Tepees dotted the banks  of the Slave River and lines of blanketed Indians paraded its shores.  Near the boat landing a group of chiefs, grotesque in semi-barbaric,  semicivilized splendor, but black-browed, austere-eyed, stood in savage  dignity with folded arms and high-held heads. Lounging on the grassy  bank were white men, traders, trappers and officials of the post.    All eyes were on the distant curve of the river where, as it lost  itself in a fine-fringed bend of dark green, white-glinting waves  danced and fluttered. A June sky lay blue in the majestic stream;  ragged, spear-topped, dense green trees massed down to the water;  beyond rose bold, bald-knobbed hills, in remote purple relief.    A long Indian arm stretched south. The waiting eyes discerned a black  speck on the green, and watched it grow. A flatboat, with a man  standing to the oars, bore down swiftly.    Not a red hand, nor a white one, offered to help the voyager in the  difficult landing. The oblong, clumsy, heavily laden boat surged with  the current and passed the dock despite the boatman's efforts. He swung  his craft in below upon a bar and roped it fast to a tree. The Indians  crowded above him on the bank. The boatman raised his powerful form  erect, lifted a bronzed face which seemed set in craggy hardness, and  cast from narrow eyes a keen, cool glance on those above. The silvery  gleam in his fair hair told of years.    Silence, impressive as it was ominous, broke only to the rattle of  camping paraphernalia, which the voyager threw to a level, grassy bench  on the bank. Evidently this unwelcome visitor had journeyed from afar,  and his boat, sunk deep into the water with its load of barrels, boxes  and bags, indicated that the journey had only begun. Significant, too,  were a couple of long Winchester rifles shining on a tarpaulin.    The cold-faced crowd stirred and parted to permit the passage of a  tall, thin, gray personage of official bearing, in a faded military  coat.    \"Are you the musk-ox hunter?\" he asked, in tones that contained no  welcome.    The boatman greeted this peremptory interlocutor with a cool laugh--a  strange laugh, in which the muscles of his face appeared not to play.    \"Yes, I am the man,\" he said.    \"The chiefs of the Chippewayan and Great Slave tribes have been  apprised of your coming. They have held council and are here to speak  with you.\"    At a motion from the commandant, the line of chieftains piled down to  the level bench and formed a half-circle before the voyager. To a man  who had stood before grim Sitting Bull and noble Black Thunder of the  Sioux, and faced the falcon-eyed Geronimo, and glanced over the sights  of a rifle at gorgeous-feathered, wild, free Comanches, this  semi-circle of savages--lords of the north--was a sorry comparison.  Bedaubed and betrinketed, slouchy and slovenly, these low-statured  chiefs belied in appearance their scorn-bright eyes and lofty mien.  They made a sad group.    One who spoke in unintelligible language, rolled out a haughty,  sonorous voice over the listening multitude. When he had finished, a  half-breed interpreter, in the dress of a white man, spoke at a signal  from the commandant.    \"He says listen to the great orator of the Chippewayan. He has summoned  all the chiefs of the tribes south of Great Slave Lake. He has held  council. The cunning of the pale-face, who comes to take the musk-oxen,  is well known. Let the pale-face hunter return to his own  hunting-grounds; let him turn his face from the north. Never will the  chiefs permit the white man to take musk-oxen alive from their country.  The Ageter, the Musk-ox, is their god. He gives them food and fur. He  will never come back if he is taken away, and the reindeer will follow  him. The chiefs and their people would starve. They command the  pale-face hunter to go back. They cry Naza! Naza! Naza!\"    \"Say, for a thousand miles I've heard that word Naza!\" returned the  hunter, with mingled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#18)"],[1,", are well represented by Kate  Westrop, who has published four short voluntaries for organ. Laura  Wilson Barker, wife of Tom Taylor, has entered the classical arena with  a violin sonata, and has done more ambitious work in the music to \"As  You Like It\" and the cantata \"[OE]none.\" Caroline Carr Moseley has  produced several pieces for violin and 'cello, and has written one or  two dainty works for toy instruments. Mrs. Beatrice Parkyns, born of  English parents at Bombay, has several charming violin compositions to  her credit, and the same may be said for Kate Ralph, a native of  England. Emily Josephine Troup is another violin composer, who has also  tried her hand at songs and piano pieces. Maggie Okey, at one time wife  of the pianist De Pachmann, and now married to Maitre Labori, famous as  the advocate of Dreyfus, has composed a violin sonata, a violin romance,  and several piano pieces. Kate Oliver is responsible for some concerted  music, while Alma Sanders has produced a piano trio, a violin sonata,  and a piano quartette. To-day Ethel Barns heads the list of violin  composers among women.    [Illustration: MAGGIE OKEY]    By far the most important name in this field of woman's work is that of  Agnes Zimmermann. Born in Cologne in 1847, she received her musical  education in London. At the Royal Academy of Music she studied piano  under Pauer and Potter, afterward attaining high rank as a performer. In  composition, her teachers were Steggall and George Macfarren. She won  the silver medal of the Academy, and obtained the king's scholarship  twice, in 1860 and 1862. In the next year she made her London debut, and  a year later appeared with the Gewandhaus orchestra at Leipsic. Her fame  as a classical pianist was soon established, and her excellent work in  editing the sonatas of Beethoven and Mozart bore added testimony to her  musical knowledge. Her compositions include a piano trio, three violin  sonatas, a suite and other pieces for piano, and a number of songs. Her  clear style and thorough musicianship have given these works more than a  passing value, and she is reckoned to-day as one of England's leading  women composers.    Still more numerous than the violin composers are the women who have  shown their ability merely in the form of a few piano pieces. Almost  every eminent performer is at some time tempted to express his own  musical thoughts in writing. Such has been the case with Arabella  Goddard, the famous pianist. Born near St. Malo, in 1838, she played in  her native place at the age of four. At six she was studying with  Kalkbrenner at Paris. At eight she played before Queen Victoria, and  published six piano waltzes. Among her maturer works are an excellent  ballade and several other piano selections. Dora Schirmacher, born in  1862, was less precocious, but won the Mendelssohn prize at Leipsic,  where she studied under Wenzel and Reinecke. Her works consist of a  suite, a valse-caprice, a sonata, a serenade, a set of tone pictures,  and so on. Amina Beatrice Goodwin was another child prodigy, first  playing in public at the age of six. She studied with Reinecke and  Jadassohn at Leipsic, Delaborde at Paris, and finally with Liszt and  Clara Schumann. She has published many piano selections, besides  founding a pianoforte college and publishing a good book of practical  hints on technique and touch. She is married to an American, Mr. W.  Ingram-Adams. The list of piano composers might be extended much  further, but these are the most representative names.    Of the long list of song composers, but few have produced anything of  marked artistic value. Foremost among these at present is Liza Lehmann,  who has recently become famous through her song cycle, \"In a Persian  Garden.\" She came of a gifted family, for her father, Rudolph, was an  excellent artist, and her mother a composer of songs, which were  modestly published over the initials \"A. L.\" Her grandfather was Robert  Chambers, famed by his Encyclopaedia. Born in London, she studied singing  with Randegger, and composition afterward with Freudenberg, of  Wiesbaden, and the Scottish composer, MacCunn. She expected to make a  career as a singer, but found herself so extremely nervous whenever  appearing that she was forced to abandon the idea. She persevered  awhile, however, and has been frequently heard in Great Britain and  Germany.    In 1894 she retired and married Mr. Herbert Bedford. Only then did she  begin those efforts in composition that have since met with such great  success. She has published a number of songs and some piano and violin  pieces, but is always thought of in connection with her cyclic setting  of the Persian poet, Omar Khayyam. When she composed this, she was  little known, and fortune as well as fame was a stranger to her. Oddly  enough, all the London publishers refused this work, which has since  then charmed two continents. Finally it was sung at her house by a  gathering of musical friends, the performers being Ben Davies, Albani,  Hilda Wilson, and David Bispham. They were so delighted with it that  they brought it out at the Monday \"Pops,\" and after that its success was  assured. There are other song cycles by this composer, notably \"In  Memoriam,\" but none equal the \"Persian Garden.\" It is full of rich  passages of exquisite beauty, moving pathos, and strong expression.    Frances Allitsen passed a lonely childhood in a little English village.  She would improvise warlike ballads for amusement, though her later  works and her character are marked by gentleness of thought. She hoped  to make a name by singing, but unfortunately lost her voice. Her family  were all hostile to a musical career, and regarded her tastes as most  heinous. She describes the scene of her youth as a place \"where, if a  girl went out to walk, she was accused of wanting to see the young men  come in on the train; where the chief talk was on the subject of  garments, and the most extravagant excitement consisted of sandwich  parties.\" Domestic misfortunes and illness left their mark on her, but  could not hinder her musical progress. She finally sent some manuscripts  to Weist Hill, of the Guildhall Music School, and with his approval came  to London. Her days were spent in teaching, to earn money with which to  pay for her studies in the evening, but she braved all difficulties,  and finally won success. She is best known in America by her songs,  which are really beautiful settings of Browning, Shelley, Longfellow,  Heine, and other great poets. But she is a master of orchestral  technique as well. Her overture, \"Slavonique,\" was successfully  performed, and a second one, \"Undine,\" won a prize from the lady  mayoress. Her room is a delightful gallery of photographs of artists and  musicians. She has a picture of Kitchener, whose example, she says,  ought to cure any one of shirking; hence the mistaken anecdote that she  could not work without a picture of Kitchener on her desk.    Mrs. Rhodes, known in the musical world as Guy d'Hardelot, was of French  ancestry and birth. She spent her childhood in a Norman castle, and her  youth in Paris and London, studying music. After marriage she met with  reverses, and was forced to earn a living by teaching. She studied  composition with Clarence Lucas, and gives him great credit for  developing individuality. She has three excellent guiding  maxims,--\"Avoid familiar things, choose words so clear that people can  see the picture, and be sure that the climax comes at the end.\"    Her songs succeed in combining the elegance and lightness of the French  school with the appealing simplicity of the English. Her reputation was  established with her first publication, the melancholy and dramatic  \"Sans Toi.\" Her many succeeding lyrics range from liveliest humour to  deepest pathos, and all are thoroughly artistic. Widely known are \"Sans  Toi,\" \"Mignon,\" \"Vos Yeux,\" \"Say Yes,\" \"Chanson de Ma Vie,\" \"La  Fermiere,\" \"Valse des Libellules,\" and many others. Her favourite poets  are Victor Hugo and Ella Wheeler Wilcox, a rather strange mixture. Her  only attempt in larger form is the operetta \"Elle et Lui.\" She is a  great friend of Mme. Calve, who is especially fond of her songs. She has  accompanied Calve on an American tour, and has appeared with her before  Queen Victoria at Windsor. She sings herself with a light but attractive  voice and the most perfect diction. Of late she has composed for Calve  some acting songs, such as \"The Fan.\"    Maude Valerie White takes rank among the very best of England's song  writers. Born at Dieppe in 1855, she entered the Royal Academy at the  usual age, completing her studies at Vienna. During her student days she  produced a mass, and at various times she has composed violin and 'cello  pieces, but she has won most fame, as well as much money, by her songs.  Grove considers the best of these to be the settings of Herrick and  Shelley; he gives high praise to her setting of the latter's \"My soul  is an enchanted boat,\" and considers it one of the finest songs in our  language. Her other lyrics include such gems as \"To Mary,\" \"Ophelia's  Song,\" \"Ave Maria,\" and so forth, besides a number of exquisite German  and French songs. Her careful attention to the metre and accents of the  words, combined with the excellence of the poetry she chooses and the  real worth of her music, have won the admiration of all music lovers.    Florence Gilbert, a sister of the well-known dramatist, has won some  renown as a ballad composer. She studied harmony and composition with  Stainer and Prout, and after this excellent training spent much time in  creative work. For a long time she let her songs remain in manuscript,  out of diffidence as to their value. Finally Mme. Helen Trust, the  singer, came upon them, and obtained permission to bring out the  \"Message to Phyllis.\" Its success was pronounced, and the composer was  easily persuaded to issue her other works.
