Almost alone in the world, I dare not venture into society  more than absolute necessity requires. I am obliged to live as an  exile. If I go into company, a painful anxiety comes over me, since I am  apprehensive of being exposed to the danger of betraying my situation.  Such has been my state, too, during this half year that I have spent in  the country. Enjoined by my intelligent physician to spare my hearing  as much as possible, I have been almost encouraged by him in my present  natural disposition, though, hurried away by my fondness for society, I  sometimes suffered myself to be enticed into it. But what a humiliation  when any one standing beside me could hear at a distance a flute that I  could not hear, or any one heard the shepherd singing, and I could  not distinguish a sound! Such circumstances brought me to the brink of  despair, and had well-nigh made me put an end to my life: nothing but  my art held my hand. Ah! it seemed to me impossible to quit the world  before I had produced all that I felt myself called to accomplish. And  so I endured this wretched life--so truly wretched, that a somewhat  speedy change is capable of transporting me from the best into the  worst condition. Patience--so I am told--I must choose for my guide.  Steadfast, I hope, will be my resolution to persevere, till it shall  please the inexorable Fates to cut the thread. Perhaps there may be an  amendment--perhaps not; I am prepared for the worst--I, who so early  as my twenty-eighth year was forced to become a philosopher--it is not  easy--for the artist more difficult than for any other. O God! thou  lookest down upon my misery; thou knowest that it is accompanied with  love of my fellow-creatures, and a disposition to do good! O men! when  ye shall read this, think that ye have wronged me; and let the child of  affliction take comfort on finding one like himself, who, in spite of  all the impediments of Nature, yet did all that lay in his power to  obtain admittance into the rank of worthy artists and men.... I go to  meet death with joy. If he comes before I have had occasion to develop  all my professional abilities, he will come too soon for me, in spite  of my hard fate, and I should wish that he had delayed his arrival. But  even then I am content, for he will release me from a state of endless  suffering. Come when thou wilt, I shall meet thee with firmness.  Farewell, and do not quite forget me after I am dead; I have deserved  that you should think of me, for in my lifetime I have often thought of  you to make you happy. May you ever be so!\"      VIII.    The music of Beethoven has left a profound impress on art. In speaking  of his genius it is difficult to keep expression within the limits of  good taste. For who has so passed into the very inner _penetralia_ of  his great art, and revealed to the world such heights and depths of  beauty and power in sound?    Beethoven composed nine symphonies, which, by one voice, are ranked as  the greatest ever written, reaching in the last, known as the \"Choral,\"  the full perfection of his power and experience. Other musicians have  composed symphonic works remarkable for varied excellences, but in  Beethoven this form of writing seems to have attained its highest  possibilities, and to have been illustrated by the greatest variety of  effects, from the sublime to such as are simply beautiful and melodious.  His hand swept the whole range of expression with unfaltering mastery.  Some passages may seem obscure, some too elaborately wrought, some  startling and abrupt, but on all is stamped the die of his great genius.    Beethoven's compositions for the piano, the sonatas, are no less notable  for range and power of expression, their adaptation to meet all the  varied moods of passion and sentiment. Other pianoforte composers have  given us more warm and vivid color, richer sensual effects of tone, more  wild and bizarre combination, perhaps even greater sweetness in melody;  but we look in vain elsewhere for the spiritual passion and poetry, the  aspiration and longing, the lofty humanity, which make the Beethoven  sonatas the _suspiria de pro-fundis_ of the composer's inner life. In  addition to his symphonies and sonatas, he wrote the great opera of  \"Fidelio,\" and in the field of oratorio asserted his equality with  Handel and Haydn by composing \"The Mount of Olives.\" A great variety of  chamber music, masses, and songs, bear the same imprint of power. He  may be called the most original and conscientious of all the composers.  Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, and Mendelssohn were inveterate  thieves, and pilfered the choicest gems from old and forgotten writers  without scruple. Beethoven seems to have been so fecund in great  conceptions, so lifted on the wings of his tireless genius, so austere  in artistic morality, that he stands for the most part above the  reproach deservedly borne by his brother composers.    Beethoven's principal title to fame is in his superlative place as a  symphonic composer. In the symphony music finds its highest intellectual  dignity; in Beethoven the symphony has found its loftiest master.          SCHUBERT, SCHUMANN, AND FRANZ.      I.    Heinrich Heine, in his preface to a translation of \"Don Quixote,\"  discusses the creative powers of different peoples. To the Spaniard  Cervantes is awarded the first place in novel-writing, and to our own  Shakespeare, of course, the transcendent rank in drama.    \"And the Germans,\" he goes on to say, \"what palm is due to them? Well,  we are the best writers of songs in the world. No people possesses such  beautiful _Lieder_ as the Germans. Just at present the nations have too  much political business on hand; but, after that has once been settled,  we Germans, English, Spaniards, Frenchmen, and Italians, will all go to  the green forest and sing, and the nightingale shall be umpire. I feel  sure that in this contest the song of Wolfgang Goethe will gain the  prize.\"    There are few, if any, who will be disposed to dispute the verdict of  the German poet, himself no mean rival, in depth and variety of lyric  inspiration, even of the great Goethe. But a greater poet than either  one of this great pair bears the suggestive and impersonal name of \"The  People.\" It is to the countless wealth of the German race in folk-songs,  an affluence which can be traced back to the very dawn of civilization  among them, that the possibility of such lyric poets as Goethe, Heine,  Ruckert, and Uhland is due. From the days of the \"Nibelungenlied,\" that  great epic which, like the Homeric poems, can hardly be credited to any  one author, every hamlet has rung with beautiful national songs, which  sprung straight from the fervid heart of the people. These songs are  balmy with the breath of the forest, the meadow, and river, and  have that simple and bewitching freshness of motive and rhythm which  unconsciously sets itself to music.    The German _Volkslied_, as the exponent of the popular heart, has a wide  range, from mere comment on historical events, and quaint, droll  satire, such as may be found in Hans Sachs, to the grand protest against  spiritual bondage which makes the burden of Luther's hymn, \"Ein' feste  Burg.\" But nowhere is the beauty of the German song so marked as in  those _Lieder_ treating of love, deeds of arms, and the old mystic  legends so dear to the German heart. Tieck writes of the \"Minnesinger  period:\" \"Believers sang of faith, lovers of love; knights described  knightly actions and battles, and loving, believing knights were their  chief audiences. The spring, beauty, gayety, were objects that could  never tire; great duels and deeds of arms carried away every hearer, the  more surely the stronger they were painted; and as the pillars and dome  of the church encircled the flock, so did Religion, as the highest,  encircle poetry and reality, and every heart in equal love humbled  itself before her.\"    A similar spirit has always inspired the popular German song, a simple  and beautiful reverence for the unknown, the worship of heroism, a vital  sympathy with the various manifestations of Nature. Without the fire  of the French _chansons_, the sonorous grace of the Tuscan _stornelli_,  these artless ditties, with their exclusive reliance on true feeling,  possess an indescribable charm.    The German _Lied_ always preserved its characteristic beauty. Goethe,  and the great school of lyric poets clustered around him, simply  perfected the artistic form, without departing from the simplicity and  soulfulness of the stock from which it came. Had it not been for the  rich soil of popular song, we should not have had the peerless lyrics  of modern Germany. Had it not been for the poetic inspiration of  such word-makers as Goethe and Heine, we should not have had such  music-makers in the sphere of song as Schubert and Franz.    The songs of these masters appeal to the interest and admiration of the  world, then, not merely in virtue of musical beauty, but in that they  are the most vital outgrowths of Teutonic nationality and feeling.    The immemorial melodies to which the popular songs of Germany were  set display great simplicity of rhythm, even monotony, with frequent  recurrence of the minor keys, so well adapted to express the melancholy  tone of many of the poems. The strictly strophic treatment is used, or,  in other words, the repetition of the melody of the first stanza in all  the succeeding ones. The chasm between this and the varied form of the  artistic modern song is deep and wide, yet it was overleaped in a single  swift bound by the remarkable genius of Franz Schubert, who, though his  compositions were many and matchless of their kind, died all too young;  for, as the inscription on his tombstone pathetically has it, he was  \"rich in what he gave, richer in what he promised.\"      II.    The great masters of the last century tried their hands in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#18)"],[1,"ruments, small  combinations, and full orchestra (though seldom with the complete  modern apparatus), is the Serenade. Historically, it is a contemporary  of the old suites and the first symphonies, and like them it consists  of a group of short pieces, so arranged as to form an agreeable  contrast with each other, and yet convey a sense of organic unity.  The character of the various parts and their order grew out of the  purpose for which the serenade was originated, which was that  indicated by the name. In the last century, and earlier, it was no  uncommon thing for a lover to bring the tribute of a musical  performance to his mistress, and it was not always a \"woful ballad\"  sung to her eyebrow. Frequently musicians were hired, and the tribute  took the form of a nocturnal concert. In Shakespeare's \"Two Gentlemen  of Verona,\" _Proteus_, prompting _Thurio_ what to do to win _Silvia's_  love, says:        \"Visit by night your lady's chamber window      With some sweet concert: to their instruments      Tune a deploring dump; the night's dread silence      Will well become such sweet complaining grievance.\"    [Sidenote: _Out-of-doors music._]    [Sidenote: _Old forms._]    [Sidenote: _The \"Dump.\"_]    [Sidenote: _Beethoven's Serenade, op. 8._]    It was for such purposes that the serenade was invented as an  instrumental form. Since they were to play out of doors, _Sir  Thurio's_ musicians would have used wind instruments instead of  viols, and the oldest serenades are composed for oboes and bassoons.  Clarinets and horns were subsequently added, and for such bands Mozart  wrote serenades, some of which so closely approach the symphony that  they have been published as symphonies. A serenade in the olden time  opened very properly with a march, to the strains of which we may  imagine the musicians approaching the lady's chamber window. Then came  a minuet to prepare her ear for the \"deploring dump\" which followed,  the \"dump\" of Shakespeare's day, like the \"dumka\" of ours (with which  I am tempted to associate it etymologically), being a mournful piece  of music most happily characterized by the poet as a \"sweet  complaining grievance.\" Then followed another piece in merry tempo and  rhythm, then a second _adagio_, and the entertainment ended with an  _allegro_, generally in march rhythm, to which we fancy the musicians  departing. The order is exemplified in Beethoven's serenade for  violin, viola, and violoncello, op. 8, which runs thus: _March_;  _Adagio_; _Minuet_; _Adagio_ with episodic _Scherzo_; _Polacca_;  _Andante_ (variations), the opening march repeated.    [Sidenote: _The Orchestral Suite._]    [Sidenote: _Ballet music._]    The Suite has come back into favor as an orchestral piece, but the  term no longer has the fixed significance which once it had. It is now  applied to almost any group of short pieces, pleasantly contrasted in  rhythm, tempo, and mood, each complete in itself yet disclosing an  aesthetic relationship with its fellows. Sometimes old dance forms are  used, and sometimes new, such as the polonaise and the waltz. The  ballet music, which fills so welcome a place in popular programmes,  may be looked upon as such a suite, and the rhythm of the music and  the orchestral coloring in them are frequently those peculiar to the  dances of the countries in which the story of the opera or drama for  which the music was written plays. The ballets therefore afford an  excellent opportunity for the study of local color. Thus the ballet  music from Massenet's \"Cid\" is Spanish, from Rubinstein's \"Feramors\"  Oriental, from \"Aida\" Egyptian--Oriental rhythms and colorings being  those most easily copied by composers.    [Sidenote: _Operatic excerpts._]    [Sidenote: _Gluck and Vestris._]    The other operatic excerpts common to concerts of both classes are  either between-acts music, fantasias on operatic airs, or, in the case  of Wagner's contributions, portions of his dramas which are so  predominantly instrumental that it has been found feasible to  incorporate the vocal part with the orchestral. In ballet music from  the operas of the last century, some of which has been preserved to  the modern concert-room, local color must not be sought. Gluck's  Greeks, like Shakespeare's, danced to the rhythms of the seventeenth  century. Vestris, whom the people of his time called \"The god of the  dance,\" once complained to Gluck that his \"Iphigenie en Aulide\" did  not end with a chaconne, as was the rule. \"A chaconne!\" cried Gluck;  \"when did the Greeks ever dance a chaconne?\" \"Didn't they? Didn't  they?\" answered Vestris; \"so much the worse for the Greeks.\" There  ensued a quarrel. Gluck became incensed, withdrew the opera which was  about to be produced, and would have left Paris had not Marie  Antoinette come to the rescue. But Vestris got his chaconne.          VI    _At a Pianoforte Recital_      [Sidenote: _Mr. Paderewski's concerts._]    No clearer illustration of the magical power which lies in music, no  more convincing proof of the puissant fascination which a musical  artist can exert, no greater demonstration of the capabilities of an  instrument of music can be imagined than was afforded by the  pianoforte recitals which Mr. Paderewski gave in the United States  during the season of 1895-96. More than threescore times in the course  of five months, in the principal cities of this country, did this  wonderful man seat himself in the presence of audiences, whose numbers  ran into the thousands, and were limited only by the seating capacity  of the rooms in which they gathered, and hold them spellbound from two  to three hours by the eloquence of his playing. Each time the people  came in a gladsome frame of mind, stimulated by the recollection of  previous delights or eager expectation. Each time they sat listening  to the music as if it were an evangel on which hung everlasting  things. Each time there was the same growth in enthusiasm which began  in decorous applause and ended in cheers and shouts as the artist came  back after the performance of a herculean task, and added piece after  piece to a programme which had been laid down on generous lines from  the beginning. The careless saw the spectacle with simple amazement,  but for the judicious it had a wondrous interest.    [Sidenote: _Pianoforte recitals._]    [Sidenote: _The pianoforte's underlying principles._]    I am not now concerned with Mr. Paderewski beyond invoking his aid in  bringing into court a form of entertainment which, in his hands, has  proved to be more attractive to the multitude than symphony, oratorio,  and even opera. What a world of speculation and curious inquiry does  such a recital invite one into, beginning with the instrument which  was the medium of communication between the artist and his hearers!  To follow the progressive development of the mechanical principles  underlying the pianoforte, one would be obliged to begin beyond the  veil which separates history from tradition, for the first of them  finds its earliest exemplification in the bow twanged by the primitive  savage. Since a recognition of these principles may help to an  understanding of the art of pianoforte playing, I enumerate them now.  They are:    1. A stretched string as a medium of tone production.    2. A key-board as an agency for manipulating the strings.    3. A blow as the means of exciting the strings to vibratory action, by  which the tone is produced.    [Sidenote: _Their Genesis._]    [Sidenote: _Significance of the pianoforte._]    Many interesting glimpses of the human mind and heart might we have in  the course of the promenade through the ancient, mediaeval, and modern  worlds which would be necessary to disclose the origin and growth of  these three principles, but these we must forego, since we are to  study the music of the instrument, not its history. Let the knowledge  suffice that the fundamental principle of the pianoforte is as old as  music itself, and that scientific learning, inventive ingenuity, and  mechanical skill, tributary always to the genius of the art, have  worked together for centuries to apply this principle, until the  instrument which embodies it in its highest potency is become a  veritable microcosm of music. It is the visible sign of culture in  every gentle household; the indispensable companion of the composer  and teacher; the intermediary between all the various branches of  music. Into the study of the orchestral conductor it brings a  translation of all the multitudinous voices of the band; to the  choir-master it represents the chorus of singers in the church-loft or  on the concert-platform; with its aid the opera director fills his  imagination with the people, passions, and pageantry of the lyric  drama long before the singers have received their parts, or the  costumer, stage manager, and scene-painter have begun their work. It  is the only medium through which the musician in his study can  commune with the whole world of music and all its heroes; and though  it may fail to inspire somewhat of that sympathetic nearness which one  feels toward the violin as it nestles under the chin and throbs  synchronously with the player's emotions, or those wind instruments  into which the player breathes his own breath as the breath of life,  it surpasses all its rivals, save the organ, in its capacity for  publishing the grand harmonies of the masters, for uttering their  \"sevenfold chorus of hallelujahs and harping symphonies.\"    [Sidenote: _Defects of the pianoforte._]    [Sidenote: _Lack of sustaining power._]    This is one side of the picture and serves to show why the pianoforte  is the most universal, useful, and necessary of all musical  instruments. The other side shows its deficiencies, which must also be  known if one is to appreciate rightly the many things he is called  upon to note while listening intelligently to pianoforte music.  Despite all the skill, learning, and"]]]
