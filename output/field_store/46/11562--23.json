It held a  distinct part in Winona's development.    The girl was growing up suddenly. In the almost nursery atmosphere of  Highfield, with nothing to stimulate her faculties she had remained at a  very childish stage, but now, with a world of art, music, science and  literature dawning round her she seemed to leap upward to the level of  her new intellectual horizon. It is a glorious time when we first begin  to reap the inheritance of the ages, and to discover the rich stores of  delight that master minds have laid up for us to enjoy. Life was moving  very fast to Winona; she could not analyze all her fresh thoughts and  impressions, but she felt she could no more go back to her last year's  mental outlook than she could have worn the long clothes of her  babyhood. She was sixteen now, for her birthday fell on the 20th of  January. Somehow sixteen sounded so infinitely older than fifteen! There  was a dignity about it and a sense of importance. In another year she  would actually be \"sweet seventeen,\" and a member of that enviable  school hierarchy the Sixth Form!    Winona could have made herself thoroughly happy at Abbey Close but for  the shadow that existed between herself and Aunt Harriet. Percy's secret  was a perpetual burden on her conscience. At meal times she would often  find her eyes wandering towards the oak cupboard, and would start  guiltily, hoping Miss Beach had not noticed. The more she thought about  the subject the more convinced she became that she ought to give some  hint of the state of affairs, though how to do so without implicating  her brother was at present beyond her calculations. One day, however, a  really hopeful opportunity seemed to arise. A case of a disputed will  was being tried at the Seaton Sessions; the defendants were friends of  Miss Beach's, and after reading the account of the proceedings, Aunt  Harriet laid down the local paper with a few comments.    \"I suppose people ought to make their wills very fast and firm,\" said  Winona. It was seldom she ventured on an independent remark. As a rule  she left her aunt to do the talking.    \"Undoubtedly. Nothing causes more trouble than carelessness in this  respect.\"    \"Ought we all to make wills?\"    \"If we have anything to leave it's advisable.\"    \"Ought I?\"    \"Well, hardly at present, I should say!\"    \"Ought mother?\" Winona was growing redder and redder.    \"No doubt she has done so.\"    \"Have you made yours, Aunt Harriet?\"    The horrible deed was done, and Winona, crimson to the roots of her  hair, felt she had, metaphorically speaking, burnt her boats.    Miss Beach stared at her as if electrified.    \"What do you want to know for?\" she asked, suspiciously. \"I think that's  decidedly my business and not yours!\"    Winona collapsed utterly, and murmuring something about preparation,  fled to her bedroom.    \"There! I've just gone and put my foot in it altogether!\" she groaned.  \"I've no tact! I went and blurted it out like an idiot. She'll never  forgive me! Oh, why can't I go and tell her the whole business, and then  she'd understand! I do hate this sneaking work. Percy, you wretched boy,  I'd like to bump your head against the wall! It's too bad to land me in  your scrape! Well, I suppose it can't be helped. I've said it, and it's  done. But I know I'll be in disgrace for evermore.\"    Certainly Aunt Harriet's manner towards Winona, after this unfortunate  episode, was stiffer than formerly. She was perfectly kind, but the gulf  between them had widened. They still discussed conventional topics at  meal-times, or rather Miss Beach made leading remarks and Winona said  \"Yes,\" or \"No,\" for such a one-sided conversation could hardly be termed  discussion. The girl felt it a relief when, as often happened, her aunt  took refugein a book. Occasionally Winona would pluck up courage to  relate news from her home letters, but of her school life and all her  new impressions and interests she scarcely spoke at all. Judging from  the children's correspondence the new governess at Highfield, after a  stormy beginning, was making some impressions upon her wild little  pupils.    \"I hated her at first,\" wrote Mamie, \"but she tells us the most lovely  fairy tales, and we're learning to model in clay. I like it because it  makes such a mess. Ernie smacked her yesterday, and she wouldn't let him  do his painting till he'd said he was sorry.\"    Winona laughed over the letters, picturing the lively scenes that must  be taking place at home.    \"Do the kids a world of good!\" she commented. \"They were running to  seed. Even I could see that, as long ago as last summer, and I don't  mind confessing, quite to myself, that I was fairly raw then. I didn't  know very much about anything till I came to the 'Seaton High.'\"    Winona's second term was running far more smoothly than her first.  Thanks to Miss Lever's coaching she could now hold her own in her Form,  and though she might not be the most shining light, at any rate she was  not numbered among the slackers.    Her progress was marked in more quarters than she suspected. Margaret  Howell had had the Scholarship winners under observation ever since  their arrival. As head girl she made it her business to know something  about every girl in the school. \"The General,\" as she was nicknamed, was  universally voted a success. She and Kirsty Paterson between them had  organized a new era of things. Every one felt the \"Seaton High\" was  waking up and beginning to found a reputation for itself. The various  guilds and societies were prospering, and following Margaret's pet motto  \"Pro Bono Publico,\" had exterminated private quarrels and instituted the  most business-like proceedings and the strictest civility at committee  meetings. Already the general tone was raised immeasurably, and public  spirit and school patriotism ran high. To encourage zeal and  strenuousness, Margaret and Kirsty had laid their heads together and  decided to found what they called \"The Order of Distinguished School  Service.\" Any girl who was considered to have performed some action  worthy of special commendation or who had otherwise contributed to the  general benefit, was to be rewarded with a badge, and her name was to be  chronicled in a book kept for the purpose.    The very first to gain the honor was little Daisy Hicks, a Second Form  child, who won 9,400 marks out of a possible 10,000 in the Christmas  exams, so far the highest score known in the school. Agnes Heath, who  wrung special praise from the doctor who conducted the Ambulance  examination, and Gladys Vickcrs, whose photograph of the hockey team was  published in the Seaton _Weekly Graphic_, were also placed upon the  distinguished list, having substantially helped the credit of the  school. The badge was only a rosette made of narrow ribbons, stitched in  tiny loops into the form of a daisy, with a yellow disk, and white and  pink outer rays. If meant very much, however, to the recipient, who knew  that her name would be handed down to posterity in the school  traditions, and every girl was immensely keen to earn it.    A new institution in the school this term was the foundation of a  library. It had been a pet project of Margaret's ever since her  appointment as head prefect. Just before the Christmas breaking up she  had called a general meeting and begged everybody after the holidays to  present at least one contribution.    \"It may be a new book or an old one,\" she had explained, \"but it must be  really interesting. Please don't bring rubbish. Give something you would  enjoy reading yourself and can recommend to your friends.\"    The response to her appeal had been greater than she anticipated. Nobody  failed to comply, and some of the girls brought several books apiece. A  start was made with three hundred and forty-one volumes, which was  regarded as a most creditable beginning. For the present they were piled  up in the prefects' room until shelves had been made to receive them.  Miss Bishop had given the order to the joiner, but owing to the war it  might be some time before the work was finished.    Meanwhile Margaret decided that the books ought to be catalogued and  labeled, so that they would be quite ready when the bookcases arrived.  She cast about for helpers in this rather arduous task, and her choice  fell upon Winona, who happened to have a spare half-hour between her  classes on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Winona, immensely flattered,  accepted the responsibility with glee, and was put to work under the  \"General's\" directions. She thoroughly enjoyed sorting, dusting, pasting  on labels, and making alphabetical lists.    \"I shouldn't mind being a librarian some day in a big public library,\"  she assured Ellinor Cooper, her fellow-assistant.    \"You'd have to be quicker than you are at present, then,\" remarked  Margaret dryly. \"They wouldn't think you worth your salt if you spent  all your time reading the books. Buck up, can't you? and get on!\"    At which Winona guiltily shut \"Shirley\" with a bang and turned her  attention to the paste-pot.    While Margaret was cultivating the intellectual side of the school,  Kirsty was carefully attending to her duties as Games Captain. Her work  among the juniors prospered exceedingly. They were taking to hockey with  wild enthusiasm and gave evidence of considerable promise. As most of  them were free at three o'clock, they got the chance of playing almost  every day. Kirsty was extremely anxious that these practices should be  properly supervised. She was too busy herself to take them personally,  so she was obliged to delegate the work to anybody who had the spare  time.    \"The girls I want most are all at classes or music lessons,\" she  lamented. \"Not a single one of the team's available.

I  have suppressed the brigade ----; I have cashiered it in the face of the  army, that is to say, of Europe.--I have written to ----, informing him  that he ran great risks of being broke, if he did not take care.\" Some  days after he met this ----, at the head of his troops, and still  indignant, he called to him, \"You disgrace yourself; you set the example  of plunder. Be silent, or go back to your father; I do not want your  services any further.\"    From Thorn, Napoleon descended the Vistula. Graudentz belonged to  Prussia; he avoided passing it; but as that fortress was important to  the safety of the army, an officer of artillery and some fireworkers  were sent thither, with the ostensible motive of making cartridges; the  real motive remained a secret; the Prussian garrison, however, was  numerous, and stood on its guard, and the emperor, who had proceeded  onward, thought no more of it.    It was at Marienburg that the emperor again met Davoust. That marshal,  whether through pride, natural or acquired, was not well pleased to  recognize as his leader any other individual than the master of Europe.  His character, besides, was despotic, obstinate, and tenacious; and as  little inclined to yield to circumstances as to men. In 1809, Berthier  was his commander for some days, during which Davoust gained a battle,  and saved the army, by disobeying him. Hence arose a terrible hatred  between them: during the peace it augmented, but secretly; for they  lived at a wide distance from each other, Berthier at Paris, Davoust at  Hamburgh; but this Russian war again brought them together.    Berthier was getting enfeebled. Ever since 1805, war had become  completely odious to him. His talent especially lay in his activity and  his memory. He could receive and transmit, at all hours of the day and  night, the most multiplied intelligence and orders; but on this occasion  he had conceived himself entitled to give orders himself. These orders  displeased Davoust. Their first interview was a scene of violent  altercation; it occurred at Marienburg, where the emperor had just  arrived, and in his presence.    Davoust expressed himself harshly, and even went so far as to accuse  Berthier of incapacity or treachery. They both threatened each other,  and when Berthier was gone, Napoleon, influenced by the naturally  suspicious character of the marshal, exclaimed, \"It sometimes happens  that I entertain doubts of the fidelity of my oldest companions in arms;  but at such times my head turns round with chagrin, and I do my utmost  to banish so heart-rending a suspicion.\"    While Davoust was probably enjoying the dangerous pleasure of having  humbled his enemy, the emperor proceeded to Dantzic, and Berthier, stung  by resentment, followed him there. From that time, the zeal, the glory  of Davoust, the exertions he had made for this new expedition, all that  ought to have availed him, began to be looked upon unfavourably. The  emperor had written to him \"that as the war was about to be carried into  a barren territory, where the enemy would destroy every thing, it was  requisite to prepare for such a state of things, by providing every  thing within ourselves:\" Davoust had replied to this by an enumeration  of his preparations--\"He had 70,000 men, who were completely organized;  they carried with them twenty-five days' provisions. Each company  comprised swimmers, masons, bakers, tailors, shoemakers, armourers, and  workmen of every class. They carried every thing they required with  them; his army was like a colony; hand-mills followed. He had  anticipated every want; all means of supplying them were ready.\"    Such great exertions ought to have pleased; they, however, displeased;  they were misrepresented. Insidious observations were overheard by the  emperor. \"This marshal,\" said they to him, \"wishes to have it thought  that he has foreseen, arranged, and executed every thing. Is the  emperor, then, to be no more than a spectator of this expedition? Must  the glory of it devolve on Davoust?\"--\"In fact,\" exclaimed the emperor,  \"one would think it was he that commanded the army.\"    They even went further, and awakened some of his dormant fears: \"Was it  not Davoust who, after the victory of Jena, drew the emperor into  Poland? Is it not he who is now anxious for this new Polish war?--He who  already possesses such large property in that country, whose accurate  and severe probity has won over the Poles, and who is suspected of  aspiring to their throne?\"    It is not easy to say whether the pride of Napoleon was shocked by  seeing that of his lieutenants encroaching so much on his own; or  whether, in the course of this irregular war, he felt himself thwarted  more and more by the methodical genius of Davoust; certain it is, the  unfavourable impression against him struck deeper; it was productive of  fatal consequences; it removed from his confidence a bold, tenacious and  prudent warrior, and favoured his predilection for Murat, whose rashness  was much more flattering to his ambitious hopes. In other respects,  these dissensions between his great officers did not displease Napoleon;  they gave him information; their harmony would have made him uneasy.    From Dantzic the emperor proceeded, on the 12th of June, to Koenigsberg.  At that place ended the inspection of his immense magazines, and of the  second resting-point and pivot of his line of operations. Immense  quantities of provisions, adequate to the immensity of the undertaking,  were there accumulated. No detail had been neglected. The active and  impassioned genius of Napoleon was then entirely directed towards that  most important and difficult department of his expedition. In that he  was profuse of exhortations, orders, and even money, of which his  letters are a proof. His days were occupied in dictating instructions on  that subject; at night he frequently rose to repeat them again. One  general received, on a single day, six despatches from him, all  distinguished by the same solicitude.    In one, these words were remarked, \"For masses like these, if  precautions be not taken, the grain of no country can suffice.\" In  another, \"It will be requisite for all the provision-waggons to be  loaded with flour, bread, rice, vegetables, and brandy, besides what is  necessary for the hospital service. The result of all my movements will  assemble 400,000 men on a single point. There will be nothing then to  expect from the country, and it will be necessary to have every thing  within ourselves.\" But, on the one hand, the means of transport were  badly calculated; and, on the other, he allowed himself to be hurried on  as soon as he was put in motion.          CHAP. III.      From Koenigsberg to Gumbinnen, he reviewed several of his armies;  conversing with the soldiers in a gay, frank, and often abrupt style;  well aware that, with such unsophisticated and hardy characters,  abruptness is looked upon as frankness, rudeness as force, haughtiness  as true nobility; and that the delicacy and graces which some officers  bring with them from the salons are in their eyes no better than  weakness and pusillanimity; that these appear to them like a foreign  language, which they do not understand, and the accents of which strike  them as ridiculous.    According to his usual custom, he promenaded before the ranks. Knowing  in which of his wars each regiment had been with him, at the sight of  the oldest soldiers he occasionally halted; to one he recalled the  battle of the Pyramids; another he reminded of Marengo, Austerlitz,  Jena, or Friedland, and always by a single word, accompanied by a  familiar caress. The veteran who believed himself personally recognized  by his emperor, rose in consequence in the estimation of his junior  companions, who regarded him as an object of envy.    Napoleon, in this manner, continued his inspection; he overlooked not  even the youngest soldiers: it seemed as if every thing which concerned  them was to him matter of deep interest; their least wants seemed known  to him. He interrogated them: Did their captains take care of them? had  they received their pay? were they in want of any requisite? he wished  to see their knapsacks.    At length he stopped at the centre of the regiment; there being apprised  of the places that were vacant, he required aloud the names of the most  meritorious in the ranks; he called those who were so designated before  him, and questioned them. How many years' service? how many campaigns?  what wounds? what exploits? He then appointed them officers, and caused  them to be immediately installed, himself prescribing the forms;--all  particularities which delighted the soldier! They told each other how  this great emperor, the judge of nations in the mass, occupied himself  with them in their minutest details; that they composed his oldest and  his real family! Thus it was that he instilled into them the love of  war, of glory and himself.    The army, meantime, marched from the Vistula to the Niemen. This last  river, from Grodno as far as Kowno, runs parallel with the Vistula. The  river Pregel, which unites the two, was loaded with provisions: 220,000  men repaired thither from four different points; there they found bread  and some foraging provisions. These provisions ascended that river with  them, as far as its direction would allow.    When the army was obliged to quit the flotilla, its select corps took  with them sufficient provisions to reach and cross the Niemen, to  prepare for a victory, and to arrive at Wilna. There, the emperor  calculated on the magazines of the inhabitants, on those of the enemy  and on his own, which he had ordered to be brought from Dantzic, by the  Frischhaff, the Pregel, the Deine, the canal Frederic, and the Vilia.
