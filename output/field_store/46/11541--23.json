On this point therefore the probabilities are wholly on the side of  development as against reformation.    An additional reason against the reformation theory is found in the fact  that phratries, on this theory, would never exceed two in number, but in  practice there are, as shown in Chapter II, wide variations.

Resemblances and       Differences of Names. Place of Origin. Formative Elements of the       Names: Suffixes, Prefixes. Meanings of the Class Names.      The priority of phratries over classes is commonly admitted and it is  unnecessary to argue the question at length. The main grounds for the  assumption are: (1) that it is _a priori_ probable that the fourfold  division succeeded the twofold division, exactly as the eightfold  division has succeeded, and apparently is still gaining ground, at the  expense of the four-class system. (2) Over a considerable and compact  area phratries alone are found without a trace of named classes, if we  except the anomalous organisation recorded by Dawson in S.W. Victoria.  On the other hand, while we find certain tribes among whom no phratry  names have yet been discovered, it is inherently probable that this is  due to their having been forgotten and not to their never having  existed. It is possible that the encroachments of an alien class system  have in some cases helped on the extinction of the phratry names. (3) We  find classes without phratry names, not in a compact group, but  scattered up and down more or less at random, suggesting that chance and  not law has been at work to produce this result. (4) Where class names  are found without corresponding phratry names, they are invariably  arranged in what may be termed anonymous phratries; that is to say, in  pairs or fours, so that the member of one class is under normal  circumstances not at liberty to select a wife at will from the other  three, but is usually limited to one of the other classes. This state of  things clearly points to a time when the phratries were recognised by  the tribes in question.    (5) While the classes are arranged in pairs or fours, according to  whether the system is four- or eight-class, the totems, on the other  hand, are distributed phratry fashion; in other words, one group of  totems belongs to each pair or quadruplet of classes. This divergent  organisation of the classes (four or eight for the whole tribe) and  totems (two groups for the whole tribe) can only be explained on the  supposition that the phratry everywhere preceded the class organisation.    The spatial relations of the phratries and classes are sufficiently  clear from the map; and a table shows how far cross divisions are found.    The main area of disturbance of the normal relations is, as shown in  Table IV (p. 51), the district occupied by the Koorgilla class-system  and its immediate neighbourhood. The Yungaroo-Witteru group has three  representatives in the Koorgilla class and one in the Kurpal class. The  Pakoota-Wootaroo phratry has likewise three in the Koorgilla class, a  fourth being in the Yowingo organisation. A large area is occupied by  the Mallera-Witteru phratry in the Koorgilla class, and one tribe is  again found in the Yowingo group. No class names are recorded for the  Undekerebina in the Pakoota group, and no phratry names for the Mycoolon  and Workobongo in the Yowingo group, nor for the Yerunthully in the  Koorgilla group, which in addition to tribes belonging to the three  Wuthera phratries also embraces within its limits the small Purgoma and  Jouon tribes.    The only other anomaly recorded in addition to those mentioned is among  the tribes on the south and south-east of the area just dealt with,  which have the Barang class names with the Kamilaroi phratry names, or  the Kamilaroi class names with tribal phratry names. In four cases  therefore the phratry is found outside the limits of the class usually  associated with it, or, in other words, it is associated with a strange  class system. In one case, that of the Kalkadoon, this is sufficiently  explained by the fact that the tribe is itself now remote geographically  speaking from its fellows, owing to the interposition of Pitta-Pitta  and allied tribes. In the other three cases the facts seem to point to a  change in the intertribal relationships in the period intervening  between the adoption of phratry names and the introduction of the class  system. If the lines of intercourse and intermarriage had suffered a  revolution in the interval, the names, the origin of which we have yet  to consider, would naturally show a different grouping of the tribes;  for it is on the grouping of the tribes that the spread of the names,  whether of phratries or classes, must have depended.    The main mass of the tribes organised on the four-class system lies in  Queensland and New South Wales, and whereas only two sets of names are  found in the latter colony, no less than fifteen (some of which are,  however, of more than doubtful authenticity) are reported from various  parts of Queensland. From Northern Territory two (Anula and Mara) of  small extent are reported[111]; a considerable area of this colony, as  well as of South and West Australia, is occupied by the Arunta system,  and the closely allied classes to the north-west of them. The only other  four-class system in West Australia of which we have definite  information is that west and north of King George's Sound and eastwards  for an unknown distance.    Covering nearly the whole of New South Wales outside the area occupied  by the two-phratry tribes of the Darling country, and extending far up  into Queensland, we find the well-known Muri-Kubbi, Ippai-Kumbo classes  (1) of the Kamilaroi nation[112]. The Kamilaroi system appears to have  touched the sea in the neighbourhood of Sydney. According to Mr Mathews,  the Darkinung, who inhabited this part of New South Wales, substituted  Bya for Muri. (1_a_) In like manner the Wiradjeri are stated by Gribble  to have replaced Kumbo by Wombee; this may however be no more than a  dialectical variant.    Lying along the sea coast north-east of the Darkinung and east of the  main mass of Kamilaroi tribe were the Kombinegherry and other tribes,  whom Mr Mathews denominates the Anaywan. Their classes are given by him  as Irrpoong, Marroong, Imboong, and Irrong; but an earlier authority  gives the forms Kurbo, Marro, Wombo, and Wirro (2); at Wide Bay we find  Baran, Balkun, Derwen, and Bundar (3) with an alternative form Banjoor.    North of them, still on the coast, we find the Kuinmurbura with Kurpal,  Kuialla, Karilbura, and Munal (4); for the Taroombul, which I am unable  to locate, Mr Mathews gives Koodala in place of Kuialla and Karalbara  for Karilbura. For the Kangoollo, lying inland from this group, Mr  Mathews gives Kearra, Banjoor, Banniar, and Koorpal. This suggests that  there is some confusion, for the names include two from 4, and one or  two from 3.    A very large area is occupied by tribes with the classes (5) Koorgila,  Bunburi, Wunggo, and Obur (and variants). They include the Yuipera and  allied tribes, the Kogai, the Wakelbura and allied tribes, the Yambeena,  the Yerunthully, the Woonamurra, the Mittakoodi, the Pitta-Pitta, etc.,  together with the Purgoma of the Palm Islands and the neighbouring  Jouon, whose headquarters are at Cooktown. In the southern portion of  this group a correspondent of Curr's has reported the classes Nullum,  Yoolgo, Bungumbura, and Teilling. We have class names analogous in form  to the third of these names, it is true, but it resembles tribal names  so closely as to suggest that the observer in question was really  referring to a tribe and not to a class. If this is so we may perhaps  identify Teilling with the Toolginbura. There seems to be no reason for  admitting these four names to a place among the other groups of class  names. In like manner we may dismiss the class names assigned to the  Yukkaburra by an inaccurate correspondent of Curr's, who gives Utheroo,  Multheroo, Yungaroo, and Goorgilla. It seems clear that the first and  third of these are really phratry names; possibly the second is a  dialectical form for Utheroo.    From Halifax Bay and Hinchinbrook Island are reported the names Korkoro,  Korkeen, Wongo, and Wotero (with variants). Among the Joongoongie of  North Queensland we find Langenam, Namegoor, Packewicky, and Pamarung  (15); and among the Karandee Curr gives an anomalous and probably  defective set, Moorob, Heyanbo, Lenai, Roanga, and Yelet.    The Goothanto and Wollungurma have Ranya, Rara, Loora, and Awunga (8);  allied to these perhaps are the Jury, Ararey, Barry, and Mungilly of the  Koogobathy; the Ahjeerena, Arrenynung, Perrynung, and Mahngal of the  Koonjan are clearly variants of the latter set. East of the Koogobathy  lie the Warkeman with Koopungie, Kellungie, Chukungie, and Karpungie  (6), with an allied tribe on the Tully River with classes, Kurongon,  Kurkulla, Chikun, Karavangie, the two latter obviously corresponding to  Warkeman classes, the second to Koorgilla.    The Miappe, Mycoolon, Kalkadoon, and Workoboongo have Youingo, Maringo,  Badingo, and Jimmilingo (9), with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17408"],[0,"The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance (#18)"],[1,".
