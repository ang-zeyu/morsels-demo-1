The lists were prepared in Smithfield,  and chambers erected around them for the accommodation of the king,  queen, princes, lords, ladies, heralds, and other spectators. As the  time approached many important personages of both sexes, attended by  numerous retinues, arrived in London. On the first day of the  tournament (Sunday) sixty-five horses, richly furnished for the  jousts, issued one by one from the Tower, each conducted by a squire  of honour, and proceeded in a slow pace through the streets of London  to Smithfield, attended by a numerous band of trumpeters and other  minstrels. Immediately after, sixty young ladies, elegantly attired  and riding on palfreys, issued from the same place, and each lady  leading a knight completely armed by a silver chain, they proceeded  slowly to the field. When they arrived there the ladies were lifted  from the palfreys and conducted to the chambers provided for them; the  knights mounted their horses and began the jousts, in which they  exhibited such feats of valour and dexterity as won the admiration of  the spectators. When the approach of night put an end to the jousts  the company repaired to the palace of the Bishop of London, in St.  Paul's Street, where the king and queen then staying, the supper was  prepared. The ladies, knights, and heralds who had been appointed  judges awarded one of the prizes, a crown of gold, to the Earl of St.  Paul as the best performer among the foreign knights, and the other, a  rich girdle adorned with gold and precious stones, to the Earl of  Huntingdon as the best performer of the English. After a sumptuous  supper the ladies and knights spent the remainder of the night in  dancing. The tournaments were continued in a similar manner on Monday,  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and on Saturday the Court,  with all the company, removed to Windsor, where the jousts, feasting,  and other diversions were renewed, and lasted several days longer.  Subsequently the king presented the foreign ladies, lords, and knights  with valuable gifts, and they returned to their own countries highly  pleased with the entertainment which they had enjoyed in England.      KING HENRY THE FOURTH    was born at Bolingbroke, in Lincolnshire, being the eldest son of John  of Gaunt and of his first wife, the heiress of the house of Lancaster,  and a grandson of Edward III. On the death of John of Gaunt in 1399,  Richard II. seized his lands, having in the previous year banished  Henry of Bolingbroke. On Henry hearing what had occurred, knowing his  own popularity and Richard's unpopularity, Henry returned from  banishment, and succeeded in an attack on Richard, whom he made a  prisoner. Then summoning a Parliament, at which Richard was formally  deposed and himself made king, Henry came to the throne with the title  of Henry IV. Soon, however, he found himself menaced by danger. Some  of the lords who had been stripped of the honours and wealth heaped  upon them by Richard entered into a conspiracy to assassinate Henry  the usurper. During the Christmas holidays they met frequently at the  lodgings of the Abbot of Westminster to plan the king's destruction.  After much deliberation they agreed to hold a splendid tournament at  Oxford on the 3rd of January, 1400. Henry was to be invited to  preside, and while intent on the spectacle a number of picked men were  to kill him and his sons. The king was keeping his Christmas at  Windsor, whither the Earl of Huntingdon presented himself and gave him  the invitation. Henry accepted it, but on the 2nd of January, the day  previous to the tournament, the Earl of Rutland, who was privy to the  plot, went secretly to Windsor and informed the king of the  arrangements which had been made for his assassination. The same  evening, after dusk, the king proceeded to London; and the next day  when the conspirators assembled at Oxford they were surprised to find  that neither the king nor their own accomplice, Rutland, had arrived.  Suspecting treachery they resolved to proceed at once to Windsor and  surprise Henry, but arrived only to find that he had escaped. They  afterwards raised the standard of revolt, but their insurrection  proved abortive, and the fate of the leaders was summary and  sanguinary.    The favourite palace of Henry the Fourth was at Eltham, where, in the  second year of his reign, he kept a grand Christmas, and entertained  the Emperor of Constantinople. At this festival the men of London made  a \"gret mummyng to him of XII. Aldermen and theire sones, for which  they had gret thanke.\" Similar festivities were observed at several  subsequent festivals; then the king's health gave way, and he passed  the last Christmas of his life in seclusion at Eltham, suffering from  fits of epilepsy, and lying frequently for hours in an unconscious  state. After Candlemas he was so much better as to be able to return  to his palace at Westminster, but he died there on the 20th of March  the same year (1413). The final scene and the parting words of the  king to his son, who became Henry V., have been beautifully depicted  by Shakespeare.      KING HENRY THE FIFTH.    In connection with the Christmas festival in 1414 a conspiracy to  murder the king is alleged against the Lollards, but the charge has  never been satisfactorily proved. \"If we are to believe the  chroniclers of the times the Lollards resolved to anticipate their  enemies, to take up arms and to repel force by force. Seeing clearly  that war to the death was determined against them by the Church, and  that the king had yielded at least a tacit consent to this iniquitous  policy, they came to the conclusion to kill not only the bishops, but  the king and all his kin. So atrocious a conspiracy is not readily to  be credited against men who contended for a greater purity of gospel  truth, nor against men of the practical and military knowledge of Lord  Cobham. But over the whole of these transactions there hangs a veil of  impenetrable mystery, and we can only say that the Lollards are  charged with endeavouring to surprise the king and his brother at  Eltham, as they were keeping their Christmas festivities there, and  that this attempt failed through the Court receiving intimation of the  design and suddenly removing to Westminster.\"[26] Lord Cobham was put  to death by cruel torture in St. Giles's Fields, London, on Christmas  Day, 1418.    In the early part of his reign Henry invaded France and achieved a  series of brilliant successes, including the famous victory at  Agincourt. The hero of this great battle did not allow the holiday  season to interfere with his military operations; but he did  generously suspend proceedings against Rouen upon Christmas Day and  supply his hungry foes with food for that day only, so that they might  keep the feast of Christmas. After his military successes in France  Henry married the Princess Katherine, the youngest daughter of Charles  VI., King of France, and the king and queen spent their first  Christmas of wedded life at Paris, the festival being celebrated by a  series of magnificent entertainments. Henry's subsequent journey to  England was \"like the ovation of an ancient conqueror.\" He and his  queen were received with great festivity at the different towns on  their way, and on the 1st of February they left Calais, and landed at  Dover, where, according to Monstrelet, \"Katherine was received as if  she had been an angel of God.\" All classes united to make the  reception of the hero of Agincourt and his beautiful bride a most  magnificent one. They proceeded first to Eltham, and thence, after due  rest, to London, where Katherine was crowned with great rejoicing on  the 24th of February, 1421. Henry's brilliant career was cut short by  his death on the last day of August, 1422.     \"Small time, but, in that small, most greatly liv'd      This star of England: fortune made his sword;    By which the world's best garden he achiev'd,      And of it left his son imperial lord.\"[27]    Fabian's account of the stately feast at the coronation of  Henry the Fifth's newly-wedded consort is an interesting  picture of the      COURT LIFE AND CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES OF THE PERIOD.    Queen Katherine was conveyed to the great hall at Westminster and  there set to dinner. Upon her right hand, at the end of the table, sat  the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry, surnamed the rich Cardinal of  Winchester; and upon her left hand the King of Scotland in his royal  robes; near the end sat the Duchess of York and the Countess of  Huntingdon. The Earl of March, holding a sceptre, knelt upon her right  side, and the Earl-Marshal upon her left; his Countess sat at the  Queen's left foot under the table, and the Countess of Kent at her  right foot. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, was overlooker, and stood  before the Queen bareheaded; Sir Richard Nevill was carver, the Earl  of Suffolk's brother cupbearer, Sir John Steward server, Lord Clifford  panterer, Lord Willoughby butler, Lord Grey de Ruthyn naperer, the  Lord Audley almoner, and the Earl of Worcester, Earl-Marshal, rode  about the hall during dinner on a charger, with a number of constables  to keep order.    The bill of fare consisted of: _First course_--Brawn and mustard,  dedells in burneaux, frument with balien, pike in erbage (pike stuffed  with herbs), lamprey powdered, trout, codling, fried plaice and  marling, crabs, leche lumbard flourished, and tarts. Then came a  subtlety representing a pelican sitting on her nest with her young and  an image of St. Katherine bearing a book and disputing with the  doctors, bearing a reason (motto) in her right hand, saying, in the  French apparently of Stratford-at-the-Bow, \"Madame le Royne,\" and the  pelican as an answer--     \"Ce est la signe    Et lu Roy    Pur tenir ioy    Et a tout sa gent,    Elle mete sa entent.\"    _Second course_--Jelly coloured with columbine flowers, white potage,  or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22072"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: North American Indian (#18)"],[1,"the spirits of departed men dancing wild dances on the skirts of  the northern clouds, and the farther he travelled the milder grew the  skies, the longer was the period of the sun's stay upon the earth, and  the softer, though less brilliant, the light of the moon.    Noting these changes as he went with a joyful heart, for they were  indications of his near approach to the land of joy and delight, he  came at length to a cabin situated on the brow of a steep hill in the  middle of a narrow road. At the door of this cabin stood a man of a  most ancient and venerable appearance. He was bent nearly double with  age. His locks were white as snow. His eyes were sunk very far into  his head, and the flesh was wasted from his bones, till they were like  trees from which the bark has been peeled. He was clothed in a robe of  white goat's skin, and a long staff supported his tottering limbs  whithersoever he walked.    The Chippeway began to tell him who he was, and why he had come  thither, but the aged man stopped him, telling him he knew upon what  errand he was bent.    \"A short while before,\" said he, \"there passed the soul of a tender  and lovely maiden, well-known to the son of the Red Elk, on her way to  the beautiful island. She was fatigued with her long journey, and  rested a while in this cabin. She told me the story of your love, and  was persuaded that you would attempt to follow her to the Lake of  Spirits.\"    The old man, further, told Outalissa that if he made speed he might  hope to overtake the maiden on the way. Before, however, he resumed  his journey he must leave behind him his body, his spear, bow, and  arrows, which the old man promised to keep for him should he return.  The Chippeway left his body and arms behind him, and under the  direction of the old man entered upon the road to the Blissful Island.  He had travelled but a couple of bowshots when it met his view, even  more beautiful than his fathers had painted it.    He stood upon the brow of a hill which sloped gently down to the water  of a lake which stretched as far as eye could see. Upon its banks  were groves of beautiful trees of all kinds, and many canoes were to  be seen gliding over its water. Afar, in the centre of the lake, lay  the beautiful island appointed for the residence of the good. He  walked down to the shore and entered a canoe which stood ready for  him, made of a shining white stone. Seizing the paddle, he pushed off  from the shore and commenced to make his way to the island. As he did  so, he came to a canoe like his own, in which he found her whom he was  in pursuit of. She recognised him, and the two canoes glided side by  side over the water. Then Outalissa knew that he was on the Water of  Judgment, the great water over which every soul must pass to reach the  beautiful island, or in which it must sink to meet the punishment of  the wicked. The two lovers glided on in fear, for the water seemed at  times ready to swallow them, and around them they could see many  canoes, which held those whose lives had been wicked, going down. The  Master of Life had, however, decreed that they should pass in safety,  and they reached the shores of the beautiful island, on which they  landed full of joy.    It is impossible to tell the delights with which they found it filled.  Mild and soft winds, clear and sweet waters, cool and refreshing  shades, perpetual verdure, inexhaustible fertility, met them on all  sides. Gladly would the son of the Red Elk have remained for ever with  his beloved in the happy island, but the words of the Master of Life  came to him in the pauses of the breeze, saying--    \"Go back to thy own land, hunter. Your time has not yet come. You  have not yet performed the work I have for you to do, nor can you yet  enjoy those pleasures which belong to them who have performed their  allotted task on earth. Go back, then. In time thou shalt rejoin her,  the love of whom has brought thee hither.\"          MACHINITOU, THE EVIL SPIRIT.      Chemanitou, being the Master of Life, at one time became the origin of  a spirit that has ever since caused him and all others of his creation  a great deal of disquiet. His birth was owing to an accident. It was  in this wise:--    Metowac, or as the white people now call it, Long Island, was  originally a vast plain, so level and free from any kind of growth  that it looked like a portion of the great sea that had suddenly been  made to move back and let the sand below appear, which was, in fact,  the case.    Here it was that Chemanitou used to come and sit when he wished to  bring any new creation to life. The place being spacious and solitary,  the water upon every side, he had not only room enough, but was free  from interruption.    It is well known that some of these early creations were of very great  size, so that very few could live in the same place, and their  strength made it difficult for even Chemanitou to control them, for  when he has given them certain powers they have the use of the laws  that govern those powers, till it is his will to take them back to  himself. Accordingly it was the custom of Chemanitou, when he wished  to try the effect of these creatures, to set them in motion upon the  island of Metowac, and if they did not please him, he took the life  away from them again. He would set up a mammoth, or other large  animal, in the centre of the island, and build it up with great care,  somewhat in the manner that a cabin or a canoe is made.    Even to this day may be found traces of what had been done here in  former years, and the manner in which the earth sometimes sinks down  shows that this island is nothing more than a great cake of earth, a  sort of platter laid upon the sea for the convenience of Chemanitou,  who used it as a table upon which he might work, never having designed  it for anything else, the margin of the Chatiemac (the stately swan),  or Hudson river, being better adapted to the purposes of habitation.    When the Master of Life wished to build up an elephant or mammoth, he  placed four cakes of clay upon the ground, at proper distances, which  were moulded into shape, and became the feet of the animal.    Now sometimes these were left unfinished, and to this day the green  tussocks to be seen like little islands about the marshes show where  these cakes of clay were placed.    As Chemanitou went on with his work, the Neebanawbaigs (or  water-spirits), the Puck-wud-jinnies (little men who vanish), and,  indeed, all the lesser manitoes, used to come and look on, and wonder  what it would be, and how it would act.    When the animal was completed, and had dried a long time in the sun,  Chemanitou opened a place in the side, and, entering in, remained  there many days.    When he came forth the creature began to shiver and sway from side to  side, in such a manner as shook the whole island for leagues. If its  appearance pleased the Master of Life it was suffered to depart, and  it was generally found that these animals plunged into the open sea  upon the north side of the island, and disappeared in the great  forests beyond.    Now at one time Chemanitou was a very long time building an animal of  such great bulk that it looked like a mountain upon the centre of the  island, and all the manitoes from all parts came to see what it was.  The Puck-wud-jinnies especially made themselves very merry, capering  behind its great ears, sitting within its mouth, each perched upon a  tooth, and running in and out of the sockets of the eyes, thinking  Chemanitou, who was finishing off other parts of the animal, would not  see them.    But he can see right through everything he has made. He was glad to  see the Puck-wud-jinnies so lively, and he bethought him of many new  creations while he watched their motions.    When the Master of Life had completed this large animal, he was  fearful to give it life, and so it was left upon the island, or  work-table of Chemanitou, till its great weight caused it to break  through, and, sinking partly down, it stuck fast, the head and tail  holding it in such a manner as to prevent it slipping further down.    Chemanitou then lifted up a piece of the back, and found it made a  very good cavity, into which the old creations which failed to please  him might be thrown.    He sometimes amused himself by making creatures very small and active,  with which he disported awhile, and finding them of very little use in  the world, and not so attractive as the little vanishers, he would  take out the life, taking it to himself, and then cast them into the  cave made in the body of the unfinished animal.    In this way great quantities of very odd shapes were heaped together  in this Roncomcomon, or Place of Fragments.    He was always careful before casting a thing he had created aside to  take out the life.    One day the Master of Life took two pieces of clay and moulded them  into two large feet, like those of a panther. He did not make  four--there were two only.    He put his own feet into them, and found the tread very light and  springy, so that he might go with great speed and yet make no noise.    Next he built up a pair of very tall legs, in the shape of his own,  and made them walk about a while. He was pleased with the motion. Then  followed a round body covered with large scales, like those of the  alligator.    He now found the figure doubling forward, and he fastened a long  black snake, that was gliding by, to the back part of the body, and  wound the other end round a sapling which grew near, and this held the  body upright, and made a very good tail.    The shoulders were broad and strong, like those of the buffalo, and  covered with hair. The neck thick and short, and full at the back.    Thus far Chemanitou had worked with little thought, but when he came  to the head he thought a long while.    He took a round ball of clay into his lap, and worked it over with  great care. While "]]]
