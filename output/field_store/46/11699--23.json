The wagons were forted up outside the Stronghold, a second square,  smaller but almost as easily defended as the adobe walls. In two or three  days the train would pull out again, starting the long trip down into  Sonora.    Rivas surveyed Anse none too amicably, his gaze going from man to horse  and its gear, then back to the Texan once more.    \"You are Tejano,\" he said flatly. \"From the Neusca----\"    Anse showed no surpise at being so accurately identified.    \"Been bush poppin',\" he agreed, smiling.    \"Not much cattle here,\" Rivas returned.    \"Run hosses in th' San Sabe 'fore th' war.\" Anse's tone was offhand, he  might have been discussing the weather.    \"_Don_ Cazar decides,\" Bartolome said. \"There is work at the corrals, but  he will decide.\"    \"Fair enough,\" Anse agreed. When Bartolome had moved out of hearing, he  added for Drew's benefit:    \"I think it'd be 'no' if that hombre had th' sayin'. He plumb don't like  my style.\"    \"But Rennie does need men--guards for the wagon trains, riders----\"    Anse shrugged as he off-saddled. \"Will he want one as got into a brawl  about his third day in town? Anyway, maybe I've a day or so to breathe  full before he tells me to roll m' bed again, if he's goin' to.\"    During the next three days Drew made a new discovery. Just as he had  fallen into an easy, working rhythm with Anse back in the army--so that on  occasion their thoughts and actions matched without the need for  speech--now they combined operations in the corrals. Drew's bare and  painfully acquired competence with the rope was paired to the Texan's  range training, while Anse's cruder and faster methods of \"toppin' a wild  one\" were smoothed by Drew's more patient gentling process. Both of them  were so absorbed by what they were doing that Tubacca and what might be  going on there had no more immediate meaning than the words in the books  which had ridden to the Stronghold in Drew's saddlebags.    In the late afternoon of the third day the Kentuckian was walking a  long-legged bay on a lead when Leon climbed to the top pole of the corral.    \"The _patron_ comes,\" he announced.    Drew faced about. Two riders escorted at hardly more than a fast walk a  buckboard in which were two other men. Drew caught a glimpse of a white  bandage under the brim of the passenger's hat and knew that Johnny Shannon  was coming home.    \"Anse!\" Drew raised a hand, suddenly knowing that his fingers were moving  in the old scout signal of trouble ahead.    The Texan came across the corral. Drew's bay snorted, took a dance step or  two to the right as if it had picked up sudden tension from the men.    \"What's up?\" Anse pushed back his hat, turned up a corner of his  neckerchief, and swabbed the lower half of his sweating face.    \"Rennie's back.\"    Drew watched Leon hurry to take the buckboard reins, watched Hunt Rennie  give a hand to Johnny. Then he saw Shannon jerk away from that aid,  walking stiffly toward Casa Grande while Rennie stood for an instant  looking after the younger man before following him.    Croaker tossed his head so high his limber ear bobbed in the murky air. He  brayed mournfully. Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face.    \"That's th' way you think it's gonna be, Croaker? Well, maybe so ... maybe  so.\"            10      \"This waitin'--\" Anse sat cross-legged on the bunk next to Drew's, his  thumb spinning the rowel of one spur. \"I never did take kindly to waitin'.  Is he or ain't he gonna sign me on?\"    Drew, lying flat, stared up at the muslin-covered ceiling which years of  dust had turned to yellow-brown. \"You ought to be used to it by  now--waitin', I mean. We had us plenty of it in the army.\"    \"Only that was sorta different, not kinda personal like this here. We was  sittin' round on our heels then, waitin' for some general to make up his  mind as to where he was gonna throw some lead fast. This is waitin' to  know if _we_'re goin' to be throwed--out!\"    \"I heard California----\" Drew began again.    \"You've sure taken a shine to Californy lately,\" Anse commented. Under his  fingers the rowel whirred. \"At least you talk about it enough.\" He sounded  irritated. \"Looky here, Drew, if that's the way you really feel, why don't  you go? I'm sayin' you don't feel that way, not by a long sight.\"    What if Drew answered with the exact truth, that he did not know how he  felt?    Nye came in, trailed by three of the other Rennie riders.    \"Johnny's got him a hoss-size headache an' maybe so a pair of burnt ears.  Th' Old Man musta lit into him hot an' heavy, chewed him out good. I'd say  they warn't even talkin' by th' time they pulled up here. Seems like th'  kid got an idear to scout north, struck trace near th' Long Canyon, rode  th' sign on his own an' was bushwacked. Guess whoever did it thought  Johnny was wolf meat, jus' took his hoss an' left him there. You gotta  give th' kid credit for havin' it in him. He kept on goin' after he came  to some----Walked till that patrol picked him up. I'd say he sure had him a  run of pure solid luck! There wasn't much pawin' an' bellerin' left in him  when Muller's boys brought him to town. Been gittin' a little of it back,  though, seems like. But maybe this here will learn him a little hoss  sense--\"    \"It was Kitchell's men who shot him?\" Leon wanted to know.    \"Could be. Warn't no Apaches, that's for certain. No Injun would have jus'  shot him down an' not made sure he was crow bait. Sure a fool thing to do,  ridin' there alone. Anyway, th' Old Man'll stick him into bed here, an'  I'll bet you Johnny ain't gonna ride out anywhere without an eye on  him--not for a good long while.\"    \"Long Canyon--\" Perse Donally, one of the other Anglo riders, paused in  shucking his shirt to look inquiringly over his shoulder. \"That sure is  off th' trail th' kid was supposed to be followin'. How come he ever  drifted that far north from th' wells round, anyway?\"    \"You ask him.\" Nye sat down on a bunk, flipped his hat away, and lay back.  \"Sure feels good jus' to stretch out a mite,\" he observed. \"Th' Old Man,  he was movin' like he warn't on speakin' terms with th' law an' there was  a sheriff behind every rock. Usually he's calm as a hoss trough on a mild  day. Johnny gittin' his hair cut with a slug sure shook Rennie up some,  almost as much as it shook Johnny. As for th' kid ridin' north--well, I'd  say that was some more of his tryin' to make a real big brag. Maybe he  thought he could run down Kitchell all by hisself. Which is jus' about as  straight thinkin' as kickin' a loaded polecat on th' tail end. But  Johnny's always been like that. Do it now, think 'bout it later. Got him  into more scrapes 'n I can count me on both hands. Hope th' Old Man gives  it to him this time, hot an' heavy, both barrels plumb center!\"    \"_Si_, it is true that Juanito looks for trouble.\" Chino Herrera rolled a  cornshuck cigarette with precise, delicate twists of his fingers. \"He is  _el chivato_--the young billy goat--that one. Ready to take on _el toro_  himself and lock horns. Such a one learns from knocks, not from warning  words. But he is yet a boy. Give him time.\"    \"He'd better give himself some time,\" Nye announced. \"Next time it may be  in th' head, not 'longside it, that he gits his lead. See you got back in  one piece, you two fightin' wildcats,\" Nye said, grinning at Drew and  Anse. \"Nothin' like tryin' to take on th' army--two to one--with th' army  havin' th' advantage. That eye's fadin' good, Drew, only two colors now,  ain't it?\"    Drew grunted and Nye laughed. \"Bet th' captain is as techy as a teased  snake every time he thinks 'bout you two. Wanted to have you all corralled  nice an' neat out to th' camp where he could use his hooks an' make at  least three ride mounts outta you. I'd walk soft near him for a while, or  you'll have about as much chance as hens amblin' into a coyote powwow.\"    \"Don't look like they was so tough they had to sneak up on th' dipper to  take a drink, do they now?\" Donally asked of the room at large.    \"Don't never judge no hoss by his coat an' curryin',\" Anse retorted.    \"I don't, son. I never do,\" Nye replied. \"As far as I'm concerned, you're  both so wild they have to tie a foot up when they give you a haircut.  Only, that sort of rep don't go down good with th' Old Man.\"    \"We figured it might not,\" Drew agreed. Nye's warning was only another  confirmation of Drew's fears. Topham, Nye, all the rest, had made it only  too plain: no trouble on the Range and no troublemakers.    He gathered up clean underrigging, another shirt. If Rennie did order him  up to the big house for firing, Drew was not going to meet him stinking of  horse and sweat. In the stream back of the water corral there was a  bathing place, and chilly as it was, Drew intended to take advantage of  it.        \"A mite cold, ain't it?\" Anse demanded from the bank as Drew splashed  vigorously to offset the chill. But the Texan was shucking boots and  clothing in turn.    There were a lot of shadows this close to twilight. Lamps twinkled in the  Stronghold. A horse nickered from the corrals, was answered from the barn.  Then a bray--Croaker sounding off. From the hills came the far-off  _yip-yip-yip_ of a coyote.    \"Hey!\" Anse stood up knee-high in the water.    \"What's the matter?\" Drew called.    \"Thought I saw somethin' movin' over there!\"    Drew took a scrambling leap out of the water to their tangle of clothing,  his hand reaching for one of the Colts in the belt he had left carefully  on top of the pile. All those stories of Apaches weaseling into touching  distance of the guard at the Stronghold.... Why, only last year the  younger Rivas boy had had his throat slit out in the hay field within  sight of his home!

Scratch-Awl.]    [Illustration: Fig. 219. Auger-Bit-Gage.] _Blackboard compasses_,  _triangles_, etc., are convenient accessories in a woodworking  classroom.    [Illustration: Fig. 220. Screw- and Wire-Gages. a. Screw-Gage. b.  Wire-Gage. c. Twist-Drill-Gage.]      8. SHARPENING TOOLS.    The _grindstone_ for woodworking tools is best when rather fine and  soft. The grinding surface should be straight and never concave. The  stone should run as true as possible. It can be made true by using a  piece of 1\" gas pipe as a truing tool held against the stone when run  dry. Power grindstones usually have truing devices attached to them,  Fig. 221. A common form is a hardened steel screw, the thread of  which, in working across the face of the grindstone, as they both  revolve, shears off the face of the stone. The surface should always  be wet when in use both to carry off the particles of stone and steel,  and thus preserve the cutting quality of the stone, and to keep the  tool cool, as otherwise, its temper would be drawn, which would show  by its turning blue. But a grindstone should never stand in water or  it would rot.    It is well to have the waste from the grindstone empty into a  cisternlike box under it, Fig. 221. In this box the sediment will  settle while the water overflows from it into the drain. Without such  a box, the sediment will be carried into and may clog the drain. The  box is to be emptied occasionally, before the sediment overflows.    [Illustration: Fig. 221. Power Grindstone.]    In order that the tool may be ground accurately, there are various  devices for holding it firmly and steadily against the stone. A good  one is shown in Figs. 221 and 222. This device is constructed as  follows: A board A is made 2\" thick, 6\" wide, and long enough when in  position to reach from the floor to a point above the level of the  top of the stone. It is beveled at the lower end so as to rest snugly  against a cleat nailed down at the proper place on the floor. The  board is held in place by a loop of iron, B, which hooks into the  holes in the trough of the grindstone. In the board a series of holes  (say 1\" in diameter) are bored. These run parallel to the floor when  the board is in place, and receive the end of the tool-holder. The  tool-holder consists of four parts: (1) a strip C, 1-1/2\" thick,  and as wide as the widest plane-bit to be ground. The forward end is  beveled on one side; the back end is rounded to fit the holes in the  main board A. Its length is determined by the distance from the edge  of the tool being ground to the most convenient hole in A, into which  the rear end is to be inserted. It is better to use as high a hole as  convenient, so that as the grindstone wears down, the stick will still  be serviceable; (2) a strip, D, of the same width as A and 7/8\" thick,  and 15\" to 18\" long; (3) a cleat, E, 5/8\"x3/4\", nailed across D; (4) a  rectangular loop of wrought iron or brass, F, which passes around the  farther end of the two strips, C and D, and is fastened loosely to D  by staples or screws.    [Illustration: Fig. 222. Grinding Device.]    [Illustration: Fig. 223. Holder for Grinding Chisels or Plane-Bits.]    The tool to be ground slips between this loop and the strip C, and  is held firmly in place by the pressure applied to the back end of D,  which thus acts as a lever on the fulcrum E.    Any desired bevel may be obtained on the tool to be sharpened, by  choosing the proper hole in A for the back end of C or by adjusting  the tool forward or backward in the clamp. As much pressure may be put  on the tool as the driving belt will stand without slipping off.    A still simpler holder for the plane-bit only, is a strip of wood  1-1/2\" thick and 2\" wide, cut in the shape G shown in Fig. 223. The  plane-bit fits into the saw-kerf K, and in grinding is easily held  firmly in place by the hand. By inserting the rear end of the stick G  into a higher or lower hole in the board A, any desired angle may be  obtained. G is shown in position in Fig. 221.    [Illustration: Fig. 224. Agacite Grinder.]    All such devices necessitate a perfectly true stone. The essential  features are, to have a rigid support against which the tool may be  pushed by the revolving stone, to hold the tool at a fixed angle  which may be adjusted, and to press the tool against the stone with  considerable pressure. The wheel should revolve toward the edge  which is being ground, for two reasons. It is easier to hold the tool  steadily thus, and the danger of producing a wire edge is lessened.  The edge as it becomes thin, tends to spring away from the stone and  this tendency is aggravated if the stone revolves away from the edge.  If the stone does not run true and there is a consequent danger of  digging into the stone with the tool which is being sharpened, the  stone would better revolve away from the edge. The grinding should  continue until the ground surface reaches the cutting edge and there  is no bright line left along the edge. If the grinding is continued  beyond this point, nothing is gained, and a heavy wire edge will be  formed.    A very convenient and inexpensive grinding tool, Fig. 224, sold as  the \"_Agacite grinder_,\"[7] has a number of different shaped grinding  stones made chiefly of carborundum.    The _oilstone_. After grinding, edge tools need whetting. This is done  on the whetstone, or oilstone. The best natural stones are found near  Hot Springs, Arkansas. The fine white ones are called Arkansas  stones, and the coarser ones Washita stones. The latter are better for  ordinary woodworking tools. The _India oilstone_, an artificial stone,  Fig. 77, p. 58, cuts even more quickly than the natural stones. It is  made in several grades of coarseness. The medium grade is recommended  for ordinary shop use. Oil is used on oilstones for the same purpose  as water on a grindstone. When an oilstone becomes hollow or uneven by  use, it may be trued by rubbing it on a flat board covered with sharp  sand, or on sandpaper tacked over a block of wood.    [Illustration: Fig. 225. Slipstone.]    _Slipstones_, Fig. 225, are small oilstones, made into various  shapes in order to fit different tools, as gouges, the bits of  molding-planes, etc.    _Files_ are used for sharpening saws, augers, scrapers, etc. See  above, p. 90.      9. CLEANING TOOLS.    The _bench duster_. One may be noted hanging on the bench shown  in Fig. 166, p. 98. Bristle brushes for cleaning the benches are  essential if the shop is to be kept tidy.    _Buffer._ Wherever a lathe or other convenient revolving shaft is  available, a buffer made of many thicknesses of cotton cloth is very  valuable for polishing tools. The addition of a little tripoli greatly  facilitates the cleaning.        [Footnote 7: Made by the Empire Implement Co., Albany, N.

The following are the chief means by which pieces of wood are fastened  together: nails, screws, bolts, plates, dowels, glue, hinges, and  locks.      NAILS    _Nails_, Fig. 226, may be classified according to the material of  which they are made; as, steel, iron, copper, and brass. Iron nails  may be galvanized to protect them from rust. Copper and brass nails  are used where they are subject to much danger of corrosion, as in  boats.    Nails may also be classified according to the process of manufacture;  as, cut nails, wrought nails, and wire nails. Cut nails are cut from  a plate of metal in such a way that the width of the nail is equal to  the thickness of the plate, and the length of the nail to the width of  the plate. In the third dimension, the nail is wedge-shaped, thin at  the point and thick at the head. Unless properly driven, such nails  are likely to split the wood, but if properly driven they are very  firm. In driving, the wedge should spread with and not across the  grain.    [Illustration: Fig. 226. a. Cut nail, common. b. Flat-head wire nail,  No. 1, common. c. Finishing nail, or brad.]    Wrought nails are worked into shape from hot steel, and have little  or no temper, so that they can be bent over without breaking, as when  clinched. Horseshoe- and trunk-nails are of this sort. They are of the  same shape as cut nails.    Wire nails are made from drawn steel wire, and are pointed, headed,  and roughened by machinery. They are comparatively cheap, hold nearly  if not quite as well as cut nails, which they have largely displaced,  can be bent without breaking, and can be clinched.    Nails are also classified according to the shape of their heads; as,  common or"]]]
