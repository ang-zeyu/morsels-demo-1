As early as 1243 an Englishman is noticed as living among the Western  Horde, the conquerors of Russia; but official intercourse begins in 1246  with John de Plano Carpini. This man, a Franciscan of Naples, started in  1245 as the Legate of Pope Innocent IV. to the Tartars, took the  northern overland route through Germany and Poland, reached Kiev, \"the  metropolis of Russia,\" through help of the Duke of Cracow, and at last  appeared in the camp of Batou, on the Volga. Hence by the Sea of Aral,  \"of moderate size with many islands,\" to the court of Batou's brother,  the Great Khan \"Cuyuc\" himself, where the Christian stranger found  himself one of a crowd of four thousand envoys from every part of Asia  (1246).    After sixteen months Carpini made his way back by the same route, \"over  the plains\" and through Kiev, to give at Rome the first genuine account  of Tartary, in its widest sense, from the Dnieper to China (1247).    The great rivers and lakes and mountains of Russia and Turkestan, the  position and distribution of the land and its peoples, \"even from the  Caspian to the Northern Ocean, where men are said to have dogs' faces,\"  are now first described by an honest and clear-headed and keen-eyed  observer, neither timid nor credulous.    Carpini really begins the reliable western map of Further Asia. His  personal knowledge did not reach China or India, but in his _Book of the  Tartars_, Europe was told nearly the whole truth, and almost nothing but  the truth, about the vast tract and the great races between the  Carpathians and the Gobi Desert. In the same was included the first fair  account of the manners and history of the \"Mongols whom we call  Tartars,\" and the simple truthfulness of the Friar stands out in all the  allusions that make his work so human;--his interviews with the Tartar  Chiefs and with brother-travellers, his dangers and difficulties from  Lettish robbers and abandoned or guarded ferries, his passage of the  Dnieper on the ice, his last three weeks on \"trotting\"[24] hacks over  the steppes.    [Footnote 24: \"_Tartari fecerunt equos nostros trotare._\"]    We have gone a good way from Abbot Daniel, for in John de Plano Carpini  Christian Europe has at last a real explorer, a real historian, a  genuine man of science, in the service of the Church and of discovery.    Carpini was followed after six years by William de Rubruquis, a Fleming  sent by St. Louis of France on the same errand of conversion and  discovery (1253), but by a different route, through the Black Sea, and  Cherson, over the Don \"at the Head of Azov, that divides Europe and  Asia, as the Nile divides Asia and Africa,\" to the great camp on the  Volga, \"the greatest river I had ever seen, which comes from Great  Bulgaria in the north and falls into a lake (the Caspian Sea), that  would take four months to journey round.\" Higher in their course the Don  and the Volga \"are not more than ten days' journey apart, but diverge as  they run south.\" The Caspian is \"made out of the Volga and the rivers  that flow into it from Persia.\" Thence through the Iron Gates of  Derbend, between the Caspian and the Caucasus, \"which Alexander made to  shut the barbarians out of Persia.\" Helped by a Nestorian, who possessed  influence at the Tartar Court, like so many of his Church, Rubruquis  reached the \"Alps\" of the Altai country, where he found a small  Nestorian lordship, governed like the Papal States, by a priest, who was  at least one original of the great mediaeval phantom--Prester John.    Crossing the great steppes of eastern \"Tartary,\" \"like the rolling sea  to look at,\" Rubruquis at last reached the Mongol headquarters at  Caracorum, satisfied on the way that the Caspian had no northern  outlet, as Strabo and Isidore had imagined. Thence he made his way home  without much fresh result.    [Illustration: THE PSALTER MAP OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY. (SEE LIST  OF MAPS)]    Though Rubruquis is well called the most brilliant and literary of the  mediaeval travellers, his mission was fruitless, and the interest of his  work lay rather in recording custom and myth--in sociology--than in  adding anything definite to the geographical knowledge of the West. John  de Plano had already been over the ground to Caracorum, and recorded all  the main characteristics of the lands west of the Gobi Desert. The  further advance, east to China, south to India, was yet to come.    But while Rubruquis was still among the Tartars, Nicolo and Matteo Polo,  the uncles of the more famous Marco, were trading (1255-65) to the  Crimea and the districts of southern Russia that were now under the  Western Horde,--and soon after, following the caravans to Bokhara, they  were drawn on to the court of Kublai Khan, then somewhere near the wall  of China. After a most friendly reception they were sent back to Europe  with presents and a letter to Pope Clement IV., offering a welcome and  maintenance to Christian teachers. Kublai \"had often questioned the  Polos of the Western lands,\" and now he asked for one hundred \"Latins,  to shew him the Christian faith, for Christ he held to be the only God.\"  Furnished with the imperial passport of the Golden Tablet, our merchants  made their way back to Acre in April, 1269.    They found the old pope dead, Gregory X. in his place, and he shewed a  coolness in answering the Khan's requests, but in 1271 they set out on  their second journey to the furthest East, taking with them two friar  preachers and their nephew Marco, now nineteen years of age.    In Armenia the friars took alarm at the troubled state of the nearer  East and turned back, just as Augustine of Canterbury tried to find a  way out of the mission to the English that Pope Gregory I. laid upon him  in 597. For the Church it was perhaps as momentous a time now as then;  the thirteenth century, if it had ended in the Christianising of the  Mongol Empire, would have turned the Catholic victory of the fourth and  sixth centuries in the West, the victory that had been worked out in the  next seven hundred years to fuller and fuller realisation, into a world  empire,--which did come at last for European civilisation, but not for  Christendom.    The Polos however kept on their way north-east for more than \"one  thousand days,\" three years and a half, till they stood in the presence  of Kublai Khan; beyond Gobi and the Great Wall and the mountain barriers  of China, in Cambaluc or Pekin, \"princess encrowned of cities capital.\"    Their journey was first through Armenia Lesser and Greater, then through  Mosul (Nineveh) to Bagdad, where the last \"Caliph and Pope of the  Saracens\" had been butchered by Holgalu and his Tartars, sewn in a sack  and thrown into the Tigris by one account, walled up alive by another,  in 1258. But though the stories in Marco's journal are a main interest  of his work, as a summary and reflection of the science and history and  general culture of the Christian world of his time, we must not here  look outside his geography. And his first place-note of value is on the  Caspian, \"which containeth in circuit twenty-eight hundred miles and is  like a lake, having no union with other seas and in which are many  islands, cities, and castles.\" The extent of the Nestorian missions,  \"through all parts of India and to Cairo and Bagdad, and wherever  Christians dwell,\" strikes him even now at the beginning of his  travels--much more when he finds their churches on the Hoang Ho and the  Yang-Tse-Kiang--declining indeed, but still living to witness to the  part which that great heresy had played as an intermediary between the  further and the nearer East--a part which history has never yet worked  out. Entering Persia as traders, the Polos went naturally to Ormuz,  already the great mart of Islam for the Indian trade, where Europeans  really entered the third, and, to them, unknown belt of the world, after  passing from a zone of known home-land through one of enemies' country,  known and only known as such. Failing to take the sea route at Ormuz for  China, as they had hoped, our Italians were obliged to strike back  north-east, through Persia and the Pamir, the Kashgar district and the  Gobi steppes, to Cathay and the pleasure domes of Kublai, visiting  Caracorum and the Altai country on the way, by a turn due north. In 1275  they were in Shang-tu, the Xanadu[25] of Coleridge--the summer capital  of Kublai Khan--and not till 1292 did they get leave to turn their faces  to the West once more.    [Footnote 25:        In Xanadu did Kublai Khan      A stately pleasure-dome decree,      Where Alph, the sacred river, ran,      Through caverns measureless to man,      Down to a sacred sea.    COLERIDGE: _Kublai Khan_.]    Here the Polos became what may be called consulting engineers to the  Mongol Court; Marco was even made in 1277 a commissioner of the Imperial  Council, and soon after sent upon government missions to Yunnan in  extreme south-west China and to Yangchow city.    The greater part of Marco's own memoirs is taken up with his account of  the thirty-four provinces of the Tartar Empire that centred round the  \"six parts of Cathay and the nine parts of Mangi,\" the districts of  northern and southern China as we know them,--an account of the roads,  rivers, and towns, the trade, the Court and the Imperial Ports, the  customs and manner of life among the subject peoples in that Empire,  perhaps the largest ever known. Especially do the travellers dwell on  the public roads from Pekin or Cambaluc through all the provinces, the  ten thousand Royal inns upon the highways, the two hundred thousand  horses kept for the public service, the wonderful speed of transit in  the Great Khan's embassages, \"so that they could go from Pekin to the  wall of China in two days.\"    But scarcely less"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18767"],[0,"Stories about Animals: with Pictures to Match (#18)"],[1,"to go  through, stopping a minute to eat that favorite morsel; he thrusts his  head into the noose; the trap is sprung, and the elastic pole twitches  the poor wayfarer up by the neck. It is rather barbarous business, this  snaring innocent rabbits; and I should much rather my young friends  would adopt either of a hundred other sports of winter, than this.    [Illustration: THE RABBIT TRAP.]    [Illustration: THE RABBIT.]    The father of a family of rabbits is said to exercise a very respectable  discipline among the children. Would it not be well for some of our  fathers and mothers to attend school, a quarter or so, in one of their  villages? The father among rabbits is a patriarch. Somebody who owned  several tame ones, tells us that whenever any of them quarreled, the  father instantly ran among them, and at once peace and order were  restored. \"If he caught any one quarreling, he always punished him as an  example to the rest. Having taught them to come to me,\" says this man,  \"with the call of a whistle, the instant this signal was given, I saw  this old fellow marshal up his forces, sometimes taking the lead, and  sometimes making them file off before him.\"          The Hare.      Probably most of my readers are so well acquainted with natural history,  that they do not need to be told that the hare and the rabbit are very  like, in their appearance, as well as in most of their habits. The two  animals, however, are sufficiently unlike to be entitled to a separate  introduction in our stories.    Hares have been known to possess a good deal of cunning, which is a  fortunate circumstance for them, as they often need not a little of this  trait of character in their numerous persecutions. \"I have seen,\" says  Du Fouilloux, a French naturalist, \"a hare so cunning, that, as soon as  it heard the huntsman's horn, it started from its place, and though at  the distance of a quarter of a league from it, leaped to a pond, and  there hid itself among the rushes, thus escaping the pursuit of the  dogs. I have seen a hare, which, after having run above two hours before  the dogs, has dislodged another hare, and taken possession of its  residence. I have seen them swim over three ponds, of which the smallest  was not less than eighty paces broad. I have seen others, which, after  having been warmly chased for two hours, have entered a sheep-cot,  through the little opening under the door, and remained among the  cattle. Others, again, when the dogs have chased them, have joined a  flock of sheep in the field, and, in like manner, remained with them. I  have seen others, which, when they heard the dogs, have concealed  themselves in the earth, or have gone along on one side of a hedge, and  returned by the other, so that there was only the thickness of the hedge  between the dogs and the hare. I have seen others, which, after they had  been chased for half an hour, have mounted an old wall of six feet high,  and taken refuge in a hole covered with ivy.\"    An English hunter tells a very affecting anecdote about two hares which  were chased by a pack of dogs. A hare which they had pursued for some  time was nearly exhausted. On the way, he came across another hare,  doubtless a personal friend of his. The latter, after a short  conversation with the former--for there was not time for many  ceremonies--took the place of the poor weary one, and allowed himself to  be chased by the dogs, while the other, who must soon have fallen a  victim to the dogs, was left to shift as best he could, and try to find  a place of shelter.    The hares in Liberia exhibit much foresight. In the month of August they  cut great quantities of soft, tender grass, and other herbs, which they  spread out to dry. This hay, early in autumn, they collect into heaps,  and place either beneath the overhanging rocks, or around the trunks of  trees, in conical heaps of various sizes, resembling the stacks in which  men sometimes preserve their hay in winter. The stacks which the hares  make are much smaller, however, not usually more than three feet high.  In the winter these stacks are covered with snow, and the animals make a  path between them and their holes. They select the best of vegetables  for their winter store, and crop them when in the fullest vigor, and  these they make into the best and greenest hay.    Dr. Towson, while in Gottingen, succeeded in getting a young hare so  tame, that it would play about his sofa and bed. It would leap upon his  knee, pat him with its fore feet, and frequently, while he was  reading, it would jump up in his lap, and knock the book out of his  hand, so as to get a share of his attention.    [Illustration: TAME HARES.]    One Sunday evening, five men were sitting on the bank of the river  Mersey, in England, singing sacred songs. The field where they were had  a forest on one side of it. As they were singing, a hare came out of  this forest, and ran toward the place where they were seated. When she  came up very near the spot, she suddenly stopped, and stood still for a  considerable time, appearing to enjoy the sound of the music. She  frequently turned her head, as if listening with intense interest. When  they stopped singing, she turned slowly toward the forest. She had  nearly reached the forest, when the gentlemen commenced singing again.  The hare turned around, and ran back swiftly, nearly to the spot where  she stood before, and listened with the same apparent pleasure, until  the music was finished, when she again retired toward the woods, and  soon disappeared.    Cowper was a great lover of pets; and I confess that I love him for this  trait in his character. He has endeared himself to me, indeed, as much  by the kindness he showed to the different animals which he had about  him, and which he had taught to love him, as by almost any other act of  his. I never think of Cowper, without thinking, too, of the interest he  took in every thing that breathed; and I hardly ever see a pet hare, or  rabbit, or squirrel, without thinking of him. If the reader is as much  interested in the poet as I am, he will like to see a portrait of him,  which I introduce in this connection. Many people take great delight in  hunting such beautiful and innocent animals as the fawn and the hare.  But Cowper was no sportsman. He could not bear to hurt any thing that  lived. You remember, perhaps, what he says in his \"Task\" about being  kind to animals. Let me see if I can quote it from memory. I guess I  can, for I learned it at school when a little boy, and those things are  always fixed in the memory more indelibly than those which are learned  in maturer years. I think he says--    \"I would not enter on my list of friends--  Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,  Yet wanting sensibility--the man  Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.  An inadvertent step may crush the snail,  That crawls at eve along the public path;  But he who has humanity, forewarned,  Will step aside, and let the reptile live.\"    [Illustration: THE POET COWPER.]    He was right--the kind-hearted poet was right. Well, as I said before,  he was not only careful about giving pain to animals, but he was very  fond of pets. First and last, he had a good many of these pets. But  there were none of them that he took so great delight in as his hares.  He had two of these pretty little creatures, and they seemed to be as  fond of him as he was of them. Cowper was subject to fits of great  despondency, or depression of spirits. With him hypochondria was a sort  of chronic disease. He would try to be cheerful. He knew the nature of  his melancholy, and often tried to remedy indirectly what could not be  reached directly. He resorted to innocent amusements in order to lead  the mind away from the contemplation of its own ills, real or imaginary.  This was well--it was philosophical--but it did not always succeed. The  disease was too deeply seated in his system. The care which he took of  his pets was no doubt one of his favorite amusements. These hares--there  were three of them at first, though one of them did not live long--had  each very different characters. The poet described them in detail in one  of his letters. Puss was the greatest favorite. He was more tractable,  tame and affectionate than the rest. Once the fellow was very sick, and  his master treated him with a great deal of kindness, gave him medicine,  and nursed him so well that he recovered. Cowper says that Puss showed  his gratitude by licking his hand for a long time, a ceremony he never  went through with but once in his life, before or afterward. Bess, who  died young, was the funny one. He had a great fund of humor and  drollery. Tiney, though very entertaining in his way, seems to have been  rather a grave and surly fellow. When he died--and he lived to a good  old age, some nine years, I think--Cowper buried him with honor, and  wrote an epitaph for him. I will copy two or three stanzas from this  epitaph, to show that Tiney got quite as good a character as he  deserved.        EPITAPH ON A HARE.        Here lies, whom hound did ne'er pursue,        Nor swifter greyhound follow,      Whose feet ne'er tainted morning dew,        Nor ear heard huntsman's hallo.        Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,        Who, nursed with tender care,      And to domestic bounds confined,        Was still a wild Jack-hare.        Though duly from my hand he took        His pittance every night,      He did it with a jealous look,        And when he could, would bite.        I kept him for his humor's sake,        For he would oft beguile      My heart of thought, that made it ache,        And force me to a smile.        But now beneath this walnut shade,        He finds his long, last home,      And waits, in snug concealment laid,        Till gentler Puss shall come.        He, still more aged, feels the shocks,        From which no power can save,      And, partner once "]]]
