Mr. Angus in his  defence ascribed the whole of the legal proceedings against him to the  malevolence of two interested parties, and had it not now been for their  influence, the circumstance of Miss Burns' death would have passed over  without remark.  Mr. Angus, so far from desiring to harm Miss Burns,  expressed himself as deeply indebted to her for her care of his children  and the affection and attention to his comforts she had always  manifested, and emphatically declared he \"loved and respected her too  well to dream of doing her any harm.\"          CHAPTER VI.      When I look around and see the various changes that have taken place in  this \"good old town\" I am sometimes lost in wonderment.  Narrow,  inconvenient, ill-paved streets have been succeeded by broad  thoroughfares--old tumble-down houses have been replaced by handsome and  costly buildings, while the poor little humble shops that once were  sufficient for our wants have been completely eclipsed by the gigantic  and elegant \"establishments\" of the present day.    I recollect Dale-street when it was a narrow thoroughfare, ill-paved and  ill-lighted at night.  It was not half the present width.  In 1808, as  the town began to spread and its traffic increase, great complaints were  constantly being made of the inconvenience of the principal streets, and  it was agreed on all sides that something should be done towards  improvement.  The first movement was made by widening Dale-street; the  improvement being by throwing the thoroughfare open from Castle-street to  Temple-court, but it really was not until 1820 that this street was set  out in anything like a bold and handsome manner.  Great difficulties were  constantly thrown in the way of alterations by many of the inhabitants,  who had lived in their old houses, made fortunes under their roofs, and  were hoping to live and die where they had been born and brought up.  Many tough battles had the authorities to fight with the owners of the  property.  Some were most unreasonable in the compensation they demanded,  while others for a time obstinately refused to enter into any  negotiations whatever, completely disregarding all promised advantages.  The most obtuse and determined man was a shoemaker or cobbler, who owned  a small house and shop which stood near Hockenall-alley.  Nothing could  persuade him to go out of his house or listen to any proposition.  Out he  would not go, although his neighbours had disappeared and his house  actually stood like an island in the midst of the traffic current.  The  road was carried on each side of his house, but there stood the cobbler's  stall alone in its glory.  While new and comfortable dwellings were  springing up, the old cobbler laughed at his persecutors, defied them,  and stood his ground in spite of all entreaty.  There the house stood in  the middle of the street, and for a long time put a stop to further and  complete improvement, until the authorities, roused by the indignation of  the public, took forcible possession of the place and pulled the old  obnoxious building about the owner's ears, in spite of his resistance and  his fighting manfully for what he thought were his rights; nor would he  leave the house until it had been unroofed, the floors torn up, and the  walls crumbling and falling down from room to room.  The cobbler stuck to  his old house to the last, showing fight all through, with a  determination and persistence worthy of a nobler cause.  Some few years  ago a barber, also in Dale-street, exhibited an equal degree of  persistence in keeping possession of his shop which was wanted for an  improvement near Temple-street.  This man clung to his old house and shop  until it was made utterly uninhabitable..    Dale-street, when I was a boy, was not very much broader than Sir  Thomas's Buildings; in some parts it was quite as narrow, especially  about Cumberland-street end.  The carrying trade at one time from  Liverpool was by means of packhorses, long strings of which used to leave  the town with their burthens, attended by their drivers, and always  mustered together in considerable number in Dale-street previous to  starting.  This they did that they might be strong enough to resist the  highwaymen who infested the roads at the end of the last century.  I have  often heard my father talk of these free gentlemen's exploits, and the  sometimes droll adventures arising from their presence.  He used to tell  a story of three volunteer officers going to Warrington by the stage to a  county muster, being stopped by a pretended footpad (a friend in  disguise) the other side of Prescot, and ignominiously robbed of  everything they possessed, even their very swords.  I cannot say I  believed the story, because I felt sure no officers, whatever service  they might be in, would have allowed themselves to be so treated.  My  father frequented the tavern which stood where Promoli's Bazaar now  stands, and where all the leading tradesmen used to assemble, and he told  us that the three officers were there one night and were terribly  \"trotted\" about their losses and that they did not altogether \"deny the  soft impeachment.\"  There was a good story current in Liverpool, I have  been told, in 1745, touching the doings of Mr. Campbell's regiment which,  when the rebellion broke out in that year, was suddenly called into  active service with orders to march to Manchester, by way of Warrington,  to resist a party of Scots said to be in that neighbourhood.  The  regiment marched at night, and of course threw out an advanced guard.  When about two miles this side of Warrington, the vanguard fell back  reporting that they had seen a party of the enemy bivouacking in the road  about a quarter of a mile ahead, and that they could see them quite  plainly lying on the ground, at the sides and in the middle of the road.  A halt was called, and a council of war summoned.  Hearts beat quickly in  some hardy frames who boldly advised an onward march, while others were  for retreating until some good plan of attack could be determined upon.  Some were for diverging from the road and continuing the march through  the lanes and bye-ways, so that, if necessary, the enemy could be  outflanked.  One bolder than the rest offered to go forward as a scout.  His proposition was eagerly accepted.  Away he went, and soon in the  distance a terrible uproar was heard--the volunteers flew to arms, and  waited in breathless suspense.  They were surprised, however, to hear the  alarm raised, but no shots fired.  The row subsided, when presently the  gallant scout was seen approaching with a prisoner he had bravely  captured--in the form of a fat goose.  The fact was that a flock of geese  had got out into the road, and they presented an appearance to the  advanced guard of troops bivouacking.  The bold men of Liverpool were  then led undauntedly forward, and it was said that every other man  marched into Warrington with his supper on his knapsack.    The most admirable improvements that the town underwent was when  Lord-street was widened and the Crescent formed, the completion of which  undertaking cost upwards of half a million of money.  Castle-street was  narrow, badly paved, and badly lighted at night, as, indeed, was the  whole town.  Yet, I recollect there were some people who objected to the  improvements at the top of Lord-street, who clung pertinaciously to the  old Potato Market, and the block of buildings called Castle Hill.  The  houses that were erected upon the site of Castle Ditch had the floors of  some of their rooms greatly inclined in consequence of the subsidence of  the soil.  There was a joke current at the time that these apartments  ought to be devoted to dining purposes, as the gravy would always run to  one side of the plate!    A great increase has taken place in the value of property in every part  of the town.  In Castle-street sixty years ago a house and shop could be  had for 30 pounds per annum.  The premises in which Roscoe's Bank was  carried on, and now occupied by Messrs. Nixon, were purchased by Mr.  Harvey who, finding his property remaining unoccupied for so long a time,  began to despair of letting it, and grew quite nervous about his bargain.  On the formation of Brunswick-street, projected in 1786, this handsome  thoroughfare was cut through Smock-alley and the houses in  Chorley-street, and swept away a portion of the old Theatre Royal in  Drury-lane; it then ran down to the old Custom-house yard, on the site of  which the Goree Piazzas and warehouses were erected.  Drury-lane was  formerly called Entwhistle-street, after an old and influential family  who filled high offices in the town in their day.    Any one can fancy what Castle-street must have been when the market was  held in it, by filling Cable-street with baskets of farmers' produce, and  blocking it up with all sorts of provisions and stalls, in which the  usual marketable commodities would be exposed for sale.    The introduction of Gas in the town was an immense stride in the march of  improvement; yet there were not a few persons who bitterly complained of  the Gas Company so often disturbing the streets to enable them to lay  down their pipes.  Frequent letters appeared in the papers of the time to  that effect.  Previous to 1817 the town was wretchedly lighted by oil  lamps which used to go out upon all trifling occasions and for  insufficient reasons.  They only pretended to show light at the best of  times.  The lamps were not lit in summer nor on moonlight nights.  They  were generally extinguished by four or five o'clock in the morning.    The gentry were at one time attended by link-men or boys in their night  excursions.  These links were stiff, tarred ropes about the thickness of  a man's arm.  They gave a flaring light with any quantity of  bituminous-odoured smoke.  In front of one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#18)"],[1,"to shoot three  or four as specimens, to skin and add to their collection.    But the lion pretty well filled the thoughts of all, and Jack was  intensely eager to see the monster that he took to himself the credit of  having shot.    As they drew near the place where the adventure of the previous night  had taken place, the verdure began to give place to brown, parched-up  sedgy grass, and the boys could not help noticing how much it seemed to  harmonise with the skin of the beast of prey they had slain.    As they drew nearer there was no difficulty in finding the spot, for a  party of great, dusky, bare-necked vultures were sitting about, gazing  hungrily at the dead beast, but afraid to approach on account of the  sticks and branches stuck about to imitate a trap.    They were so near now that they could make out the shape of the lion  amongst the dry grass, when, apparently always upon his guard, the  General suddenly presented the point of his assegai.  Coffee and Chicory  said nothing, but they did the same; and Dick and Jack, fully under the  impression that the lion had come back to life, cocked their rifles and  stood ready to fire.    Just then there was a low muttering growl, a moving of the long grass as  if something was passing through, and a smooth-coated lion bounded into  sight, gazing at them menacingly, and lashing its sides with its tail.    Wisely or no, the boys' rifles were at their shoulders on the instant,  and they fired together as Coffee and Chicory threw their spears.    There was a tremendous roar, a bound, a crash, and then silence, broken  only by the clicking of the mechanism of the rifles, as the boys rapidly  reloaded them with heavy ball.    As the smoke cleared away the General beckoned Dick and Jack to his  side, and they advanced cautiously through the grass, which they pushed  aside with the assegai and the muzzles of the rifles, till they saw, a  short distance off, the handle of an assegai sticking up.    \"There him is,\" shouted Coffee; \"my assegai!\"  And he seemed ready to  run forward and get it, but was checked by a sign from his father.    The young hunters raised their rifles to their shoulders, ready to fire  again, at the sight of the lion; but the staff of the assegai did not  even quiver; and, gaining confidence, the General went closer and parted  the grass, for his young companions to fire.    The next moment he had sprung forward, and shouted and waved his spear  above his head; for there, upon its side, lay the lion, quite dead, the  second within twenty-four hours.    \"That was your shot, Dick,\" said Jack.    \"No, no: yours,\" said Dick.    \"No; I felt as if I didn't hit it far enough forward,\" cried Jack.  \"But  we'll soon see.\"    \"Ah, yah, yah!  Inyami, Inyami!\" shouted Coffee and Chicory; and they  began to kick and bang the dead lion with their kiris, till their father  stopped them, and bade one of them go and fetch Peter or Dinny to come  and help to skin.    As it proved, there was a bullet right in the centre of the second  lion's forehead, and another in the shoulder, which ball Jack claimed,  so that Dick had, as he really deserved, the honour of shooting the  monster, and he gazed with no little pride at its tremendous  proportions.    But big as it was, it was a lioness, and slighter in build than the  tawny monster killed upon the previous evening, to which they now  turned, looking in awe at its huge claw-armed paws, and legs one mass of  muscle.  There was something almost stupendous in the power that seemed  to be condensed in its short thick neck, and broad deep shoulders, for,  being one of the maneless kind every muscle of the neck, throat, and  shoulders could be plainly seen.    \"Why, Jack, we should be like rats in the jaws of a cat if he took hold  of us,\" said Dick.    \"More need to practise our shooting.  Dicky, I shall always aim at their  eyes.\"    \"I want to get back and tell father,\" said Dick.  \"Oh, look! here he  comes.\"    In effect, Mr Rogers, who had heard the firing, was coming on at a fast  run, in dread lest anything should be wrong; but a smile of satisfaction  appeared upon his face as he came up, and heard Dick's joyful cry,  \"Father, I've shot a lion.\"    The skinning of the dangerous monsters was a tough job; but in the  Zulu's skilful hands it seemed comparatively easy, for he knew exactly  where to divide the muscles to make the limbs give way, and how to  thrust the point of his knife through various membranes; so that by  breakfast-time, with the help of Peter, both trophies were removed, and  borne to the camp in triumph.    The place being so lovely, and game being evidently abundant, Mr Rogers  decided to stay where they were for a day or two, especially as the work  of making a kraal of thorns every night became an arduous task and there  was nothing to be gained by hurrying through the wonderful country  without stopping to examine its beauties.    Then, too, the abundance of rich fine grass growing near the rivulets  that came down from the mountains was invaluable for the oxen, which had  begun to look a trifle thinner; and as the good patient beasts worked so  willingly and well, it was a pleasure to see them knee-deep in grass,  placidly munching away at the rich herbage, and in company with the  horses.    So holiday for the animals was proclaimed; Dinny, Peter, and Dirk were  ordered to keep a watchful eye upon the grazing cattle, and Mr Rogers  proposed a short walking, shooting, and natural-history-collecting  expedition.    Of course it was all nonsense, but Dick vowed that Rough'un went and  told what was to be; for the dog, who had been looking at his masters  with bright, intelligent eyes, suddenly jumped upon all fours and barked  twice, after which he trotted off to where Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus  were tied to the wheels of the waggon, put his nose to each, and barked;  and in the place of a patient attack upon tormenting flies and fleas,  the dogs leaped up, strained at their thongs, and barked and bayed  furiously.    \"Let them loose, boys,\" said Mr Rogers, to Coffee and Chicory, who ran  to perform his orders, but found it hard work; for the dogs leaped at  them, twisted the thongs between and round their legs, and upset them  twice; while as soon as they were at liberty they seemed to have  mutually agreed that this was one of the dog-days, and that it was their  duty to go right off mad.    Their antics were wonderful.  First they rushed off as hard as they  could tear, as if going straight back home to Mr Rogers' farm; the next  minute they were back, as if they had forgotten to kill Rough'un first,  for they charged down upon him, rolling him over and over, biting,  worrying, and tumbling upon him in the exuberance of their delight;  while Rough'un retaliated by biting again, and getting such a good grip  with his teeth on Pompey's tail that this sturdy fellow dragged him for  yards before Rough'un let go.    Altogether, for a few minutes there seemed to be what Dick called a  dog-storm, after which they all crouched down, with open mouths,  starting eyes, and quivering tongue, staring at the preparations going  on, and ready to be off.    \"Good old dogs!  Old Pomp! old Caesar!  What old Cras!  Hi, Rough'un!\"  cried Jack, caressing all the dogs in turn, and patting their heads,  with the effect of making them seize and pretend to worry him, seizing  his legs, jumping up, and showing their delight in a dozen ways.    Then the ammunition had to be obtained, satchels stored with provisions,  Coffee and Chicory carrying a supply for their own and their father's  use; and when the grim-looking old warrior held up a warning finger at  them and said they were not to eat the provisions, they brought a smile  to his lips by running off together and pretending to devour the  contents of the bag.    At last all was ready, and after a few words of warning to Dinny and the  others to be watchful, the little party started, Mr Rogers referring to  a small compass he carried in his pocket, and taking the bearings of the  two mountains, so as to be sure of their return.    For though the General was with them there was always the possibility of  being separated; and missing the way back in the great African wilds may  mean missing one's life.    There was plenty to see.  Flowers grew in abundance in the rich moist  places; fleshy plants abounded in the sterile rocky parts; and in every  shady niche the ferns were glorious.  The trees alone were enough to  satisfy any one with a love of beauty.  Great candelabra-shaped  euphorbias, with wondrous thorns and lovely scarlet blossoms; huge  forest-trees that seemed to have lost their own individuality in the  wreathing clusters of creeping flowering plants they bore.  Everything  was beautiful; and as they walked on in the glowing sunshine, they  seemed to have come to one of the most glorious spots of earth.    They had not proceeded far beside one of the little rivers that came  bubbling down from the mountain they were approaching before Rough'un  began to bark.    _Click_, _click_, went Dick's rifle.    \"Look, father, look! a crocodile!\" cried Jack.  \"I wanted to see a  crocodile.\"    There was a rush, a splash, and a scurry, and Rough'un came out of the  water, looking about him and staring up at his masters, as if asking  what they had done with the reptile he had chased.    \"It was not a crocodile, Jack, but a large water-lizard,\" said Mr  Rogers.    \"Plenty of crocodiles soon,\" said the General, \"big as three of me.\"    He marked off a space of about twenty feet upon the ground, to show the  length the reptiles of which he spoke, and then roughly marked out their  shape.    \"Not here,\" he said; \"over there.\"  And he pointed to the north.    \"Here's another,\" cried Dick.    And this time it was Pompey and Caesar who had hunted out a reptile,  which hissed, and snapped, and fought vigorously for a few moments when  driven to bay, but its "]]]
