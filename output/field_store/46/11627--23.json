Other civilized  countries acquired not this preeminence, nor attained unto these high  degrees of influence and power, till such time as they put away the strife  of sects out of their midst, and dealt with all classes according to one  standard. All are one people, one nation, one species, one kind. The  common interest is complete equality; justice and equality amongst mankind  are amongst the chief promoters of empire and the principal means to the  extension of the skirt of conquest. From whatever section of earth's  denizens signs of contentiousness appear, prompt punishment is required by  a just government; while any person who girds up the loins of endeavor and  carries off the ball of priority is deserving of royal favors and worthy  of splendid gifts. Times are changed, and the need and fashion of the  world are changed. Interference with creed and faith in every country  causes manifest detriment, while justice and equal dealing towards all  peoples on the face of the earth are the means whereby progress is  effected. It is right to exercise caution and care with regard to  political factions, and to be fearful and apprehensive of materialist  sects; for the subjects occupying the thoughts of the former are [designs  of] interference in political matters and [desire of] ostentation, while  the actions and conduct of the latter are subversive of safety and  tranquility. But this sect are steadfast in their own path and firmly  established in conduct and faith; they are pious, devoted, tenacious, and  consistent in such sort that they freely lay down their lives, and, after  their own way, seek to please God; they are strenuous in effort and  earnest in endeavor; they are the essence of obedience and most patient in  hardship and trouble; they sacrifice their existence and raise no  complaint or cry; what they utter is in truth the secret longing of the  heart, and what they seek and pursue is by the direction of a leader. It  is therefore necessary to regard their principles and their Chief, and not  to make a trivial thing a pretext. Now since the conduct of the Chief, the  teachings of His epistles, and the purport of His writings are apparent  and well known, the line of action of this sect is plain and obvious as  the sun. Of whatever was possible and practicable by way of  discouragement, determent, eradication, intimidation, reprehension,  slaughter, banishment, and stripes there was no lack, yet nothing was  thereby effected. In other countries when they perceived severity and  persecution in such instances to be identical with stimulation and  incitement, and saw that paying no attention was more effectual, they  abated the fire of revolution. Therefore did they universally proclaim the  equal rights of all denominations, and sounded the liberty of all classes  from east to west. This clamor and outcry, this uproar and conflagration,  are the consequences of instigation, temptation, incitement, and  provocation. For thirty years there has been no rumor of disturbance or  rebellion, nor any sign of sedition. Notwithstanding the duplication of  adherents and the increase and multiplication of this body, through many  admonitions and encouragements to virtue this sect are all in the utmost  repose and stability: they have made obedience their distinctive trait,  and in extreme submissiveness and subordination are the loyal subjects of  the King. On what lawful grounds can the government further molest them,  or permit them to be slighted? Besides this, interference with the  consciences and beliefs of peoples, and persecution of diverse  denominations of men is an obstacle to the expansion of the kingdom, an  impediment to the conquest of other countries, an obstruction to  multiplication of subjects, and contrary to the established principles of  monarchy. In the time when the mighty government of Persia did not  interfere with [men's] consciences, diverse sects entered in and abode  beneath the banner of the great king, and [many] different peoples reposed  and served under the shadow of that mighty government's protection. The  extent of the empire increased from day to day; the greater portion of the  continent of Asia was under the just rule of its administration; and the  majority of the different religions and races were [represented] amongst  the subjects of him who wore its crown. But when the custom of  interference with the creeds of all sects arose, and the principle of  inquiring into men's thoughts became the fashion and practice, the  extensive dominions of the empire of Persia diminished, and many provinces  and vast territories passed out of her hands, until it reached such a  point that the great provinces of Turan, Assyria, and Chaldea were lost;  until--what need of prolixity?--the greater part of the regions of  _Kh_urasan likewise passed out of the control of the government of Persia  by reason of the interference with matters of conscience and the  fanaticism of its governors. For the cause of the Afghan independency and  the revolt of the Turcoman tribes was in truth this thing, else were they  at no time or period separate from Persia. In face of its evident  harmfulness what necessity is there for persecuting the harmless? But if  we desire to put in force the sentence [of the doctors of religion] no one  will escape fetters and chains and the keenness of the sword, for in  Persia, apart from this sect, there exist diverse sects, such as the  Muta_sh_arris, the _Sh_ay_kh_is, the Sufis, the Nusayris, and others, each  one of whom regards the other as infidels and accuses them of crime. Under  these circumstances what need that the government should persecute this  one or that one, or disturb itself about the ideas and consciences of its  subjects and people? All are the subjects of the king, and are under the  shadow of the royal protection. Everyone who hears and obeys should be  undisturbed and unmolested, while everyone who is rebellious and  disobedient deserves punishment at the hands of his Majesty the King.  Above all, the times are completely changed, while principles and  institutions have undergone alteration. In all countries such actions  hinder development and progress, and cause decline and deterioration. Of  the violent agitation which has befallen the supports of Oriental  government the chief cause and principal factor are in truth these laws  and habits of interference; while that state the seat of whose dominion  over the Atlantic and the Baltic is in the furthest regions of the North  has, by reason of equal dealing with its different subjects and the  establishment of the uniform political rights of diverse nationalities,  acquired extensive colonies in each of the five continents of the  world.(49) Where is this little island in the North Atlantic, and where  the vast territory of the East Indies? Can such extension be obtained save  by equal justice to all peoples and classes? At all events, by means of  just laws, freedom of conscience, and uniform dealing and equity towards  all nationalities and peoples, they have actually brought under their  dominion nearly all of the inhabited quarter of the world, and by reason  of these principles of freedom they have added day by day to the strength,  power, and extent of their empire, while most of the peoples on the face  of the earth celebrate the name of this state for its justice. As regards  religious zeal and true piety, their touchstone and proof are firmness and  steadfastness in noble qualities, virtues, and perfections, which are the  greatest blessings of the human race; but not interference with the belief  of this one or that one, demolition of edifices, and cutting off of the  human race. In the middle ages, whereof the beginning was the time of the  fall of the Roman Empire, and the end the capture of Constantinople at the  hands of [the followers of] Islam, fierce intolerance and molestation of  far and near arose in [all] the countries of Europe by reason of the  paramount influence of religious leaders. The matter came to such a pass  that the edifice of humanity seemed tottering to its fall, and the peace  and comfort of chief and vassal, king and subject, became hidden behind  the veil of annihilation. Night and day all parties were slaves to  apprehension and disquietude: civilization was utterly destroyed: the  control and order of countries was neglected: the principles and  essentials of the happiness of the human race were in abeyance: the  supports of kingly authority were shaken: but the influence and power of  the heads of religion and of the monks were in all parts complete. But  when they removed these differences, persecution, and bigotries out of  their midst, and proclaimed the equal rights of all subjects and the  liberty of men's consciences, the lights of glory and power arose and  shone from the horizons of that kingdom in such wise that those countries  made progress in every direction; and whereas the mightiest monarchy of  Europe had been servile to and abased before the smallest government of  Asia, now the great states of Asia are unable to oppose the small states  of Europe. These are effectual and sufficient proofs that the conscience  of man is sacred and to be respected; and that liberty thereof produces  widening of ideas, amendment of morals, improvement of conduct, disclosure  of the secrets of creation, and manifestation of the hidden verities of  the contingent world. Moreover, if interrogation of conscience, which is  one of the private possessions of the heart and the soul, take place in  this world, what further recompense remains for man in the court of divine  justice at the day of general resurrection? Convictions and ideas are  within the scope of the comprehension of the King of kings, not of kings;  and soul and conscience are between the fingers of control of the Lord of  hearts, not of [His] servants.

And (I beg God) to  prepare for you your greatest desire--that is, the attaining (the visit to)  the blessed, perfumed, amber-scented Tomb,(49) diffused in all horizons.          \"Verily, I read thy magnificent letter, thy brilliant...\"      (50) Verily, I read thy magnificent letter, thy brilliant writing, and  found its meanings as the chanting of the verses of guidance and its  foundation based on righteousness and piety. Verily I beseech God to make  thee a sign of supplication, humbleness and submissiveness unto God, so  that thou mayest commune with thy Lord, in the gloomy hours of night and  in the morn and eve while being enkindled with the fire of the love of  God, attracted to His fragrances of holiness, strengthened by His Spirit,  speaking His praise and bowing down before His Threshold of Sanctity.  Verily, He is the Assister, the Beneficent!    Then know thou that, verily, the hosts of confirmation from the Kingdom of  God will assist every soul who is severed from aught else save God, is  associated with the commemoration of God and is rejoiced at the  glad-tidings of God. Cut thyself from this world and rely on the Supreme  Concourse, so that thou mayest heart the call from the Lofty Apex and thy  face may become illuminated with a light shining forth from the Kingdom of  El-ABHA.          \"O thou who art enkindled by the fire of the Love of...\"      O thou who art enkindled by the fire of the Love of God!    Verily, I was informed of the text of thy letter, wherein thou praisest  the firm servant of God, Mirza ........ and was rejoiced in heart for the  signs of joy which are manifested in thee in this illustrious day. I ask  God to make thee a sign of guidance, fountain of knowledge and a caller in  His name, the Merciful, so that the hearts may become gladdened by the  mention of God and the souls be led to the Kingdom of God, to this Great  Dwelling Place and Sublime Home.    As to the four stations which I refer to in the divine treatise: I ask God  to open the door before thy face, that thou mayest enter therein, that  thou mayest attain to its lights and become informed of its mysteries. I  shall not give a detailed explanation thereof, on account of the great  work (i.e., because of the exceeding press of business).    Regarding the treatise (or pamphlet) which thou didst compile in proof of  the appearance of the Kingdom of God--thou didst well! I shall read it at a  leisure time, and ask God to aide thee in compiling other useful writings  in demonstration of God.    As to organization of other meetings for the maid-servants of the  Merciful, for the spread of the fragrances of God; this is the best deed  and most complete action. I ask God to strengthen thee in this matter so  that you may organize many gatherings for the spread of the teachings of  God. Thus the Lord of Hosts will confirm you by armies of the Supreme  Concourse and hosts of the angels of heaven. Verily it is the army of  inspiration and the hosts of benediction.          \"O thou who art marching onward to God!...\"      O thou who art marching onward to God!    I have read thy beautiful letter which contained delicate meanings, and I  am made glad by its contents which expressed spiritual feelings. I have  prayed to God to send down upon thee a blessing from the Kingdom of Heaven  and thus make thy heart beat with joy in the love of God, and make thee  meek and humble before the good maid-servants of God, and pure and holy in  His Kingdom.***          \"O thou who art submissive and humble before the...\"      O thou who art submissive and humble before the Holy Threshold!    Know thou, verily, submissiveness is the good quality of the maid-servants  of God, and humility is the character of the God-fearing leaves(51) who  have sprung forth from the Tree of Mercifulness.    Thou oughtest to be characterized with these, that thou mayest be an  example for the maid-servants of the Merciful and a leader of the leaves  who are moved by the winds of the love of God. Abandon the concerns of  mankind and be naturalized with the attributes of the angels of the  Supreme Concourse, because these angels humble themselves to the lowest  thing of the things despite their honor, glory, the loftiness of station  and the greatness of their might. This is seemly to the unitarian women  and an honor for those women who are surely believing in God! This is the  consolation of the heart of the God-fearing women, and this is a  tranquility to the soul of those women who are attracted to the fragrances  of the Lord of Signs!          \"O thou whose heart is soaring in the sky of the love of...\"      O thou whose heart is soaring in the sky of the love of God!    Praise be unto Him whose light hath risen, whose appearance hath become  exalted, whose signs are promulgated and whose evidences are fulfilled.  The tongue of the realities of all things hath uttered: \"Glory be to my  God, the El-Baha!\" Thanks for His manifest Beauty and for His Great  Splendor! --for He hath quickened mankind with the spirit of guidance and  hath rendered clear the White Path of Gifts, through the arguments which  are brilliant and clear to the hearts of the intelligent and thereby these  hearts are moved, enlightened, illuminated and become cognizant of the  Mighty Message(52) in this Manifest Day of the Manifestation of the  Honorable Station(53) when the mystery of existence flows just as do the  souls in the bodies.          \"O my God! O my God!...\"      O my God! O my God!    This, Thy servant, hath advanced toward Thee and is passionately wandering  in the desert of Thy love and is walking in the path of Thy service, is  expecting Thy favors, hoping for Thy bounty, depending upon Thy Kingdom  and intoxicated by the wine of Thy gift.    O my God! Increase his fervor in Thy affection, his constancy in Thy  praise and his ardor in Thy love.    Verily, Thou art the Generous and endued with great bounty. There is no  God save Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful!          \"O thou who hast acknowledged the Kingdom of God!...\"      O thou who hast acknowledged the Kingdom of God!    I received thy letter and considered its wonderful expressions and found  therein facts which show thine approach toward God, thy passionate love of  the Beauty of God, thy cheerfulness in the Cause of God and thy turning  unto the Center of the Testament, for that thou art brightened through the  light of the effulgence.    Then praise God for that He hath made thee to show the light of guidance,  to lay hold on the hem of the robe of greatness and to be attracted by the  breaths of the Supreme Concourse. This is a matter which will satisfy thee  from aught else save God and make thee above all needs and will cause thee  to acquire an immortal wealth. Then thank God for this heavenly bounty on  which the life of spirit depends entirely in all the worlds.          \"O ye two birds in the open-space of the Love of God!...\"      O ye(54) two birds in the open-space of the Love of God!    Verily I read your letter and I inhaled therefrom a spiritual fragrance  which perfumes the nostrils of the spirit. Thank ye God that He hath  filled for you the cup of gift with the wine of the great guidance and  hath abundantly bestowed His benefit on you and hath enabled you to be  healed from spiritual ailments which deaden the souls. Truly, I say unto  you verily this guidance is a precious pearl and a gem, the lights of  which glitter and the rays of which beam forth during centuries and ages.  Appreciate ye its value and show forth spiritual virtues, merciful  characteristics and brilliant manners; so that ye may be submerged in the  seas of great mercy and shine forth from the horizon of mighty gift.          \"O thou who art longing for the Orb of the Horizons!...\"      O thou who art longing for the Orb of the Horizons!(55)    Verily, I read thine eloquent, accurate and wonderful letter, whereby the  feelings of thy heart and the loftiness of thy thoughts and the craving of  thy spirit for the Kingdom of God were expressed.    Thank thou God that He hath given thee a power for discriminating the  reality of things, hath made thy feet firm in the Path, hath made thy  heart overflowing with His love and hath exhilarated thee with the wine of  His knowledge.    I beg of God to entirely remove the veiling from thine insight, so that  thou mayest become duly cognizant of the teachings of Baha'. And I beg of  God to forgive thy sins and to illumine thy face with the light of  forgiveness, so that thou mayest conquer the self which desires the  earthly world and prevent it from its wishes and appetites.    As to the spiritual meeting which ye have organized for diffusing the  fragrances of God (i.e., for teaching the Truth), this is a good thing  that ye have performed. I beg of God, to make the Holy Spirit breathe  there in such fragrances which may perfume all regions.    Be not grieved at the smallness of your number and thank God for the power  of your spirits. He shall assist you with such a confirmation whereat  minds will be astonished and souls will be amazed.          \"O thou Secretary of the meanings emanated from the...\"      O thou Secretary of the meanings emanated from the hearts of the people of  the Kingdom.    Verily, I have read thine eloquent letter and brilliant writing, which  indicated the attraction of the people of God by the fragrances of His  Kingdom, and their gathering in the assembly of the merciful feelings and  the congregation of the upright.    I do supplicate God to confirm that spiritual assembly, that gathering of  commemoration, to that whereby the merciful faces brighten, and I beseech  Him to assist them and thee to that whereby man ascends the highest and  noblest station of excellence and the loftiest apex of honor, to make them  humble and courteous before the beloved "]]]
