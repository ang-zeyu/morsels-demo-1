We may divide the whole of Sanskrit literature, beginning with the  Rig-Veda and ending with Dayananda's Introduction to his edition of  the Rig-Veda, his by no means uninteresting Rig-Veda-bhumika, into two  great periods: that preceding the great Turanian invasion, and that  following it.    The former comprises the Vedic literature and the ancient literature  of Buddhism, the latter all the rest.    If I call the invasion which is generally called the invasion of the  _S_akas, or the Scythians, or Indo-Scythians, or Turushkas, the  _Turanian[99] invasion_, it is simply because I do not as yet wish to  commit myself more than I can help as to the nationality of the tribes  who took possession of India, or, at least, of the government of  India, from about the first century B.C. to the third century A.D.    They are best known by the name of _Yueh-chi_, this being the name by  which they are called in Chinese chronicles. These Chinese chronicles  form the principal source from which we derive our knowledge of these  tribes, both before and after their invasion of India. Many theories  have been started as to their relationship with other races. They are  described as of pink and white complexion and as shooting from  horseback; and as there was some similarity between their Chinese name  _Yueh-chi_ and the _Gothi_ or _Goths_, they were identified by  Remusat[100] with those German tribes, and by others with the _Getae_,  the neighbors of the Goths. Tod went even a step farther, and traced  the _G_ats in India and the Rajputs back to the _Yueh-chi_ and  _Getae_.[101] Some light may come in time out of all this darkness, but  for the present we must be satisfied with the fact that, between the  first century before and the third century after our era, the greatest  political revolution took place in India owing to the repeated inroads  of Turanian, or, to use a still less objectionable term, of Northern  tribes. Their presence in India, recorded by Chinese historians, is  fully confirmed by coins, by inscriptions, and by the traditional  history of the country, such as it is; but to my mind nothing attests  the presence of these foreign invaders more clearly than the break,  or, I could almost say, the blank in the Brahmanical literature of  India from the first century before to the third century after our  era.[102]    If we consider the political and social state of that country, we can  easily understand what would happen in a case of invasion and conquest  by a warlike race. The invaders would take possession of the  strongholds or castles, and either remove the old Rajahs, or make them  their vassals and agents. Everything else would then go on exactly as  before. The rents would be paid, the taxes collected, and the life of  the villagers, that is, of the great majority of the people of India,  would go on almost undisturbed by the change of government. The only  people who might suffer would be, or, at all events, might be the  priestly caste, unless they should come to terms with the new  conquerors. The priestly caste, however, was also to a great extent  the literary caste, and the absence of their old patrons, the native  Rajahs, might well produce for a time a complete cessation of literary  activity. The rise of Buddhism and its formal adoption by King Asoka  had already considerably shaken the power and influence of the old  Brahmanic hierarchy. The Northern conquerors, whatever their religion  may have been, were certainly not believers in the Veda. They seem to  have made a kind of compromise with Buddhism, and it is probably due  to that compromise, or to an amalgamation of _S_aka legends with  Buddhist doctrines, that we owe the so-called Mahayana form of  Buddhism--and more particularly the Amitabha worship--which was  finally settled at the Council under Kanishka, one of the Turanian  rulers of India in the first century A.D.    If then we divide the whole of Sanskrit literature into these two  periods, the one anterior to the great Turanian invasion, the other  posterior to it, we may call the literature of the former period  _ancient_ and _natural_, that of the latter _modern_ and _artificial_.    Of the former period we possess, _first_, what has been called the  _Veda_, _i.e._, Knowledge, in the widest sense of the word--a  considerable mass of literature, yet evidently a wreck only, saved out  of a general deluge; _secondly_, the works collected in the Buddhist  Tripi_t_aka, now known to us chiefly in what is called the Pali  dialect, the Gatha dialects, and Sanskrit, and probably much added to  in later times.    The second period of Sanskrit literature comprehends everything else.  Both periods may be subdivided again, but this does not concern us at  present.    Now I am quite willing to admit that the literature of the second  period, the modern Sanskrit literature, never was a living or national  literature. It here and there contains remnants of earlier times,  adapted to the literary, religious, and moral tastes of a later  period; and whenever we are able to disentangle those ancient  elements, they may serve to throw light on the past, and, to a certain  extent, supplement what has been lost in the literature of the Vedic  times. The metrical Law-books, for instance, contain old materials  which existed during the Vedic period, partly in prose, as Sutras,  partly in more ancient metres, as Gathas. The Epic poems, the  Mahabharata and Ramaya_n_a, have taken the place of the old Itihasas  and Akhyanas. The Pura_n_as, even, may contain materials, though much  altered, of what was called in Vedic literature the Pura_n_a.[103]    But the great mass of that later literature is artificial or  scholastic, full of interesting compositions, and by no means devoid  of originality and occasional beauty; yet with all that, curious only,  and appealing to the interests of the Oriental scholar far more than  the broad human sympathies of the historian and the philosopher.    It is different with the ancient literature of India, the literature  dominated by the Vedic and the Buddhistic religions. That literature  opens to us a chapter in what has been called the Education of the  Human Race, to which we can find no parallel anywhere else. Whoever  cares for the historical growth of our language, that is, of our  thoughts; whoever cares for the first intelligible development of  religion and mythology; whoever cares for the first foundation of what  in later times we call the sciences of astronomy, metronomy, grammar,  and etymology; whoever cares for the first intimations of  philosophical thought, for the first attempts at regulating family  life, village life, and state life, as founded on religion,  ceremonial, tradition and contract (samaya)--must in future pay the  same attention to the literature of the Vedic period as to the  literatures of Greece and Rome and Germany.    As to the lessons which the early literature of Buddhism may teach us,  I need not dwell on them at present. If I may judge from the numerous  questions that are addressed to me with regard to that religion and  its striking coincidences with Christianity, Buddhism has already  become a subject of general interest, and will and ought to become so  more and more.[104] On that whole class of literature, however, it is  not my intention to dwell in this short course of Lectures, which can  hardly suffice even for a general survey of Vedic literature, and for  an elucidation of the principal lessons which, I think, we may learn  from the Hymns, the Brahma_n_as, the Upanishads, and the Sutras.    It was a real misfortune that Sanskrit literature became first known  to the learned public in Europe through specimens belonging to the  second, or, what I called, the Renaissance period. The Bhagavadgita,  the plays of Kalidasa, such as _S_akuntala or Urva_s_i, a few episodes  from the Mahabharata and Ramaya_n_a, such as those of Nala and the  Ya_gn_adattabadha, the fables of the Hitopadesa, and the sentences of  Bhart_ri_hari are, no doubt, extremely curious; and as, at the time  when they first became known in Europe, they were represented to be of  extreme antiquity, and the work of a people formerly supposed to be  quite incapable of high literary efforts, they naturally attracted the  attention of men such as Sir William Jones in England, Herder and  Goethe in Germany, who were pleased to speak of them in terms of  highest admiration. It was the fashion at that time to speak of  Kalidasa, as, for instance, Alexander von Humboldt did even in so  recent a work as his Kosmos, as \"the great contemporary of Virgil and  Horace, who lived at the splendid court of Vikramaditya,\" this  Vikramaditya being supposed to be the founder of the Samvat era, 56  B.C. But all this is now changed. Whoever the Vikramaditya was who is  supposed to have defeated the _S_akas, and to have founded another  era, the Samvat era, 56 B.C., he certainly did not live in the first  century B.C. Nor are the Indians looked upon any longer as an  illiterate race, and their poetry as popular and artless. On the  contrary, they are judged now by the same standards as Persians and  Arabs, Italians or French; and, measured by that standard, such works  as Kalidasa's plays are not superior to many plays that have long been  allowed to rest in dust and peace on the shelves of our libraries.  Their antiquity is no longer believed in by any critical Sanskrit  scholar. Kalidasa is mentioned with Bharavi as a famous poet in an  inscription[105] dated A.D. 585-6 (507 _S_aka era), and for the  present I see no reason to place him much earlier. As to the Laws of  Manu, which used to be assigned to a fabulous antiquity,[106] and are  so still sometimes by those who write at random or at second-hand, I  doubt whether, in their present form, they can be older than the  fourth century of our era, nay I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#18)"],[1,"always attended by the absorption of heat. In liquefying air       the apparatus is so constructed that the heat absorbed is       withdrawn from air already under great pressure. This process       is continued until the temperature is lowered to the point of       liquefaction.    [Illustration: Fig. 29]    ~The Dewar bulb.~ It is not possible to preserve air in the liquid state  in a closed vessel, on account of the enormous pressure exerted by it in  its tendency to pass into the gaseous state. It may however be preserved  for some hours or even days before it will completely evaporate, by  simply placing it in an open vessel surrounded by a nonconducting  material. The most efficient vessel for this purpose is the _Dewar bulb_  shown in Fig. 29. The air is withdrawn from the space between the two  walls, thus making it nonconducting.    ~Properties and uses of liquid air.~ When first prepared, liquid air is  cloudy because of the presence of particles of solid carbon dioxide.  These may be filtered off, leaving a liquid of slightly bluish color. It  begins to boil at about -190 deg., the nitrogen passing off first, gradually  followed by the oxygen, the last portions being nearly pure oxygen. To a  certain extent oxygen is now prepared in this way for commercial  purposes.    The extremely low temperature of liquid air may be inferred from the  fact that mercury when cooled by it is frozen to a mass so hard that it  may be used for driving nails.    Liquid air is used in the preparation of oxygen and as a cooling agent  in the study of the properties of matter at low temperatures. It has  thus been found that elements at extremely low temperatures largely lose  their chemical activity.      EXERCISES    1. When oxygen and nitrogen are mixed in the proportion in which they  exist in the atmosphere, heat is neither evolved nor absorbed by the  process. What important point does this suggest?    2. What essential constituent of the air is found in larger amount in  manufacturing districts than in the open country?    3. Can you suggest any reason why the growth of clover in a field  improves the soil?    4. Why are the inner walls of a Dewar bulb sometimes coated with a film  of silver?    5. To what is the blue color of liquid air due? Does this color increase  in intensity on standing?    6. When ice is placed in a vessel containing liquid air, the latter  boils violently. Explain.    7. Taking the volumes of the oxygen and nitrogen in 100 volumes of air  as 21 and 78 respectively, calculate the percentages of these elements  present by weight.    8. Would combustion be more intense in liquid air than in the gaseous  substance?    9. A tube containing calcium chloride was found to weigh 30.1293 g. A  volume of air which weighed 15.2134 g. was passed through, after which  the weight of the tube was found to be 30.3405 g. What was the  percentage amount of moisture present in the air?    10. 10 l. of air measured at 20 deg. and 740 mm. passed through lime water  caused the precipitation of 0.0102 g. of CaCO_{3}. Find the number of  volumes of carbon dioxide in 10,000 volumes of the air.          CHAPTER IX    SOLUTIONS      ~Definitions.~ When a substance disappears in a liquid in such a way as to  thoroughly mix with it and to be lost to sight as an individual body,  the resulting liquid is called a _solution_. The liquid in which the  substance dissolves is called the _solvent_, while the dissolved  substance is called the _solute_.    ~Classes of solutions.~ Matter in any one of its physical states may  dissolve in a liquid, so that we may have solutions of gases, of  liquids, and of solids. Solutions of liquids in liquids are not often  mentioned in the following pages, but the other two classes will become  very familiar in the course of our study, and deserve special attention.      SOLUTION OF GASES IN LIQUIDS    [Illustration: Fig. 30]    It has already been stated that oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are  slightly soluble in water. Accurate study has led to the conclusion that  all gases are soluble to some extent not only in water but in many other  liquids. The amount of a gas which will dissolve in a liquid depends  upon a number of conditions, and these can best be understood by  supposing a vessel B (Fig. 30), to be filled with the gas and inverted  over the liquid. Under these circumstances the gas cannot escape or  become mixed with another gas.    ~Circumstances affecting the solubility of gases.~ A number of  circumstances affect the solubility of a gas in a liquid.    1. _Nature of the gas._ Other conditions being equal, each gas has its  own peculiar solubility, just as it has its own special taste or odor.  The solubility of gases varies between wide limits, as will be seen from  the following table, but as a rule a given volume of a liquid will not  dissolve more than two or three times its own volume of a gas.      _Solubility of Gases in Water_    1 l. of water at 760 mm. pressure and at 0 deg. will dissolve:        Ammonia                 1148.00 l.      Hydrochloric acid        503.00      Sulphur dioxide           79.79      Carbon dioxide             1.80      Oxygen                    41.14 cc.      Hydrogen                  21.15      Nitrogen                  20.03    In the case of very soluble gases, such as the first three in the table,  it is probable that chemical combination between the liquid and the gas  takes place.    2. _Nature of the liquid._ The character of the liquid has much  influence upon the solubility of a gas. Water, alcohol, and ether have  each its own peculiar solvent power. From the solubility of a gas in  water, no prediction can be made as to its solubility in other liquids.    3. _Influence of pressure._ It has been found that the weight of gas  which dissolves in a given case is proportional to the pressure exerted  upon the gas. If the pressure is doubled, the weight of gas going into  solution is doubled; if the pressure is diminished to one half of its  original value, half of the dissolved gas will escape. Under high  pressure, large quantities of gas can be dissolved in a liquid, and when  the pressure is removed the gas escapes, causing the liquid to foam or  _effervesce_.    4. _Influence of temperature._ In general, the lower the temperature of  the liquid, the larger the quantity of gas which it can dissolve. 1000  volumes of water at 0 deg. will dissolve 41.14 volumes of oxygen; at 50 deg.,  18.37 volumes; at 100 deg. none at all. While most gases can be expelled  from a liquid by boiling the solution, some cannot. For example, it is  not possible to expel hydrochloric acid gas completely from its solution  by boiling.      SOLUTION OF SOLIDS IN LIQUIDS    This is the most familiar class of solutions, since in the laboratory  substances are much more frequently used in the form of solutions than  in the solid state.    ~Circumstances affecting the solubility of a solid.~ The solubility of a  solid in a liquid depends upon several factors.    1. _Nature of the solid._ Other conditions being the same, solids vary  greatly in their solubility in liquids. This is illustrated in the  following table:      _Table of Solubility of Solids at 18 deg._    100 cc. of water will dissolve:        Calcium chloride        71.0 g.      Sodium chloride         35.9      Potassium nitrate       29.1      Copper sulphate         21.4      Calcium sulphate         0.207    No solids are absolutely insoluble, but the amount dissolved may be so  small as to be of no significance for most purposes. Thus barium  sulphate, one of the most insoluble of common substances, dissolves in  water to the extent of 1 part in 400,000.    2. _Nature of the solvent._ Liquids vary much in their power to dissolve  solids. Some are said to be good solvents, since they dissolve a great  variety of substances and considerable quantities of them. Others have  small solvent power, dissolving few substances, and those to a slight  extent only. Broadly speaking, water is the most general solvent, and  alcohol is perhaps second in solvent power.    3. _Temperature._ The weight of a solid which a given liquid can  dissolve varies with the temperature. Usually it increases rapidly as  the temperature rises, so that the boiling liquid dissolves several  times the weight which the cold liquid will dissolve. In some instances,  as in the case of common salt dissolved in water, the temperature has  little influence upon the solubility, and a few solids are more soluble  in cold water than in hot. The following examples will serve as  illustrations:      _Table of Solubility at 0 deg. and at 100 deg._    100 cc. of water will dissolve:                                    At 0 deg.           At 100 deg.        Calcium chloride            49.6 g.        155.0 g.      Sodium chloride             35.7            39.8      Potassium nitrate           13.3           247.0      Copper sulphate             15.5            73.5      Calcium sulphate             0.205           0.217      Calcium hydroxide            0.173           0.079    ~Saturated solutions.~ A liquid will not dissolve an unlimited quantity of  a solid. On adding the solid to the liquid in small portions at a time,  it will be found that a point is reached at which the liquid will not  dissolve more of the solid at that temperature. The solid and the  solution remain in contact with each other unchanged. This condition may  be described by saying that they are in equilibrium with each other. A  solution is said to be _saturated_ when it remains unchanged in  concentration in contact with some of the solid. The weight of the solid  which will completely saturate a definite volume of a liquid at a given  temperature is called the _solubility_ of the substance at that  temperature.    ~Supersaturated solutions.~ When a solution, saturated at a given  temperature, is allowed to cool it sometimes happens that no solid  crystallizes"]]]
