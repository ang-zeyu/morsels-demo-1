Mollusca in the  Quito Valley are not great in number or variety. They belong principally  to the genera _Bulimus_, _Cyclostoma_, and _Helix_. The first is as  characteristic of the Southern Continent as _Helix_ of the North and  _Achatina_ of Africa.    [Footnote 45: _Herpetodryas carinatus_, which we observed also at  Guayaquil and on the Maranon. We procured two or three species from the  natives, and several new forms from Pallatanga, on the west slope.]    [Footnote 46: _Antelopus laevis_ at Ambato, and _A. longirostris_, a new  species from Antisana Hacienda, were the only frogs noticed. The little  fish is _Pimelodes cyclopum_ (prenadilla of the Spaniards, _imba_ of the  Indians), the same that was thrown out in the eruptions of Imbabura and  Caraguairazo.]    [Footnote 47: The jigger, chigoe, or nigua (_Pulex penetrans_ of  science) is a microscopic flea, that buries itself under the skin and  lays a myriad eggs; the result is a painful tumor. Jiggers are almost  confined to sandy places.]    From the animal creation we mount by a short step to the imbruted  Indian. When and by whom the Andes were first peopled is a period of  darkness that lies beyond the domain of history. But geology and  archaeology are combining to prove that Sorata and Chimborazo have looked  down upon a civilization far more ancient than that of the Incas, and  perhaps coeval with the flint-flakes of Cornwall, and the shell-mounds  of Denmark. On the shores of Lake Titicaca are extensive ruins which  antedate the advent of Manco Capac, and may be as venerable as the  lake-dwellings of Geneva. Wilson has traced six terraces in going up  from the sea through the province of Esmeraldas toward Quito; and  underneath the living forest, which is older than the Spanish invasion,  many gold, copper, and stone vestiges of a lost population were found.  In all cases these relics are situated below high-tide mark, in a bed of  marine sediment, from which he infers that this part of the country  formerly stood higher above the sea. If this be true, vast must be the  antiquity of these remains, for the upheaval and subsidence of the coast  is exceedingly slow.    Philology can aid us little in determining the relations of the primeval  Quitonians, for their language is nearly obscured by changes introduced  by the Caras, and afterward by the Incas, who decreed that the Quichua,  the language of elegance and fashion three hundred years ago, should be  the universal tongue throughout the empire.[48] Quichua is to-day spoken  from the equator to 28 deg. S. (except by the Aymara people), or by nearly a  million and a half. We found it used, corrupted, however, by Spanish, at  the month of the Napo. There are five dialects, of which the purest is  spoken in Cuzco, and the most impure in Quito. The Indians of the  northern valley are descendants of the ancient Quitus, modified by Cara  and Peruvian blood. They have changed little since the invasion of  Pizarro. They remember their glory under the Incas, and when they steal  any thing from a white man, they say they are not guilty of theft, as  they are only taking what originally belonged to them. Some see in their  sacred care of Incarial relics a lingering hope to regain their  political life. We noticed that the pure mountaineers, without a trace  of Spanish adulteration, wore a black poncho underneath, and we were  informed by one well acquainted with their customs that this was in  mourning for the Inca. We attended an Indian masquerade dance at  Machachi, which seemed to have an historical meaning. It was performed  in full view of that romantic mountain which bears the name of the last  captain of Atahuallpa. There is a tradition that after the death of his  chief, Ruminagui burned the capital, and, retiring with his followers to  this cordillera, threw himself from the precipice. The masquerade at  Machachi was evidently intended to keep alive the memory of the Incas.  Three Indians, fantastically adorned with embroidered garments, plumed  head-dresses, and gold and silver tinsel, representing Atahuallpa and  his generals, danced to music of the rudest kind, one individual  pounding on a drum and blowing on a pipe at the same time. Before them  went three clowns, or _diablos_, with masks, fit caricatures of the  Spaniards. Like all other Indian feasts, this ended in getting gradually  and completely drunk. During the ceremony a troop of horsemen, gayly  dressed, and headed by one in regimentals with a cocked hat, galloped  twice around the Plaza, throwing oranges at the people; after which  there was a bull-bait.    [Footnote 48: \"History (says Prescott) furnishes few examples of more  absolute authority than such a revolution in the language of an empire  at the bidding of a master.\" The pronunciation of Quichua requires a  harsh, explosive utterance. Gibbon says the sound of it to him resembled  Welsh or Irish; that of Aymara, English. The letters _b_, _d_, _f_, _g_,  and _o_ are wanting in the ancient tongue of Quito; _p_ was afterward  changed to _b_, _t_ to _d_, _v_ to _f_, _c_ to _g_, and _u_ to _o_: thus  Chim-pu-razu is now Chimborazo. A few words bear a striking analogy to  corresponding Sanscrit words; as _Ynti_, the Inca for sun, and _Indra_,  the Hindoo god of the heavens.]    The features of the Quichuans have a peculiar cast, which resembles, in  D'Orbigny's opinion, no other American but the Mexican, and some  ethnologists trace a striking similarity to the natives of Van Diemen's  Land. They have an oblong head (longitudinally), somewhat compressed at  the sides and occiput; short and very slightly arched forehead;  prominent, long, aquiline nose, with large nostrils; large mouth, but  not thick lips; beautiful enduring teeth; short chin, but not receding;  cheek-bones not prominent; eyes horizontal, and never large; eyebrows  long; thick, straight, coarse, yet soft jet black hair; little or no  beard; a long, broad, deep, highly-arched chest; small hands and feet;  short stature, seldom reaching five feet, and the women still shorter; a  mulatto color (olive-brown says D'Orbigny, bronze says Humboldt), and a  sad, serious expression. Their broad chests and square shoulders remind  one of the gorilla; but we find that, unlike the anthropoid ape, they  have very weak arms; their strength lies in their backs and legs. They  have shrewdness and penetration, but lack independence and force. We  never heard one sing.[49] Always submissive to your face, taking off  his hat as he passes, and muttering, \"Blessed be the altar of God,\" he  is nevertheless very slow to perform. Soured by long ill treatment, he  will hardly do any thing unless he is compelled. And he will do nothing  well unless he is treated as a slave. Treat him kindly, and you make him  a thief; whip him, and he will rise up to thank you and he your humble  servant. A certain curate could never trust his Indian to carry  important letters until he had given him twenty-five lashes. Servile and  timid, superstitious and indolent, the Quichuans have not half the  spirit of our North American Indians. It has passed into a proverb that  \"the Indian lives without shame, eats without repugnance, and dies  without fear.\" Abject as they are, however, they are not wholly without  wit. By a secret telegraph system, they will communicate between Quito  and Riobamba in one hour. When there was a battle in Pasto, the Indians  of Riobamba knew of it two hours after, though eighty leagues distant.    [Footnote 49: Their favorite musical instrument is the _rondador_, a  number of reeds of different lengths tied in a row. The \"plaintive  national songs\" which Markham heard at Cuzco are not sung in Ecuador.]    The civilization of South America three centuries ago was nearly  confined to this Andean family, though they had attained only to the  bronze period. In the milder character of their ancient religion and  gentleness of disposition they are strongly distinguished from the  nations that encircled the vale of Anahuac, the centre of civilization  on the northern continent. But little of this former glory is now  apparent. The Incas reached an astronomical knowledge which astonished  the Spaniards, but the Quichuans of to-day count vaguely by moons and  rains. Great is the contrast between the architecture of this century  and that in the days of Huayna-Capac. There are few Incarial relics,  however, in the Valley of Quito, for the Incas ruled there only half a  century. The chief monuments are the tolas or mounds (mostly at  Cuenca), containing earthen vessels and bronze hatchets and earrings;  the _Inga-pirrca_, or oval fortress, and the _Intihuaicu_, or temple of  the sun, near Canar; the _Inga-chungana_, a massive stone resembling a  sofa, where the Inca reposed to enjoy the delightful prospect over the  Valley of Gulan; and remnants of causeways and roads.

Geological History of South America.--Rise of the Andes.--Creation       of the Amazon.--Characteristic Features of the Continent.--Andean       Chain.--The Equatorial Volcanoes.      Three cycles ago an island rose from the sea where now expands the vast  continent of South America. It was the culminating point of the  highlands of Guiana. For ages this granite peak was the solo  representative of dry land in our hemisphere south of the Canada hills.  In process of time, a cluster of islands rose above the thermal waters.  They were the small beginnings of the future mountains of Brazil,  holding in their laps the diamonds which now sparkle in the crown of Dom  Pedro II. Long protracted eons elapsed without adding a page to the  geology of South America. The Creator seems to have been busy elsewhere.

Beverl. p. 95.]          ETHELBALD AND ETHELBERT.    Ethelwolf lived only two years after making this grant; and by his will  he shared England between his two eldest sons, Ethelbald and Ethelbert;  the west being assigned to the former, the east to the latter. Ethelbald  was a profligate prince; and marrying Judith, his mother-in-law, gave  great offence to the people; but moved by the remonstrances of Swithun,  bishop of Winchester, he was at last prevailed on to divorce her.  His reign was short; and Ethelbert, his brother, succeeding to the  government, behaved himself, during a reign of five years, in a manner  more worthy of his birth and station. The kingdom, however, was still  infested by the Danes, who made an inroad and sacked Winchester, but  were there defeated. A body also of these pirates, who were quartered  in the Isle of Thanet, having deceived the English by a treaty,  unexpectedly broke into Kent, and committed great outrages.          ETHERED    Ethelbert was succeeded by his brother Ethered, who, though he defended  himself with bravery, enjoyed, during his whole reign, no tranquillity  from those Danish irruptions. His younger brother, Alfred, seconded him  in all his enterprises, and generously sacrificed to the public good all  resentment, which he might entertain on account of his being excluded by  Ethered from a large patrimony which had been left him by his father.    The first landing of the Danes, in the reign of Ethered, was among the  East Angles, who, more anxious for their present safety than for the  common interest, entered into a separate treaty with the enemy, and  furnished them with horses, which enabled them to make an irruption by  land into the kingdom of Northumberland. They there seized the city  of York, and defended it against Osbricht and AElia, two Northumbrian  princes, who perished in the assault.[*] Encouraged by these successes,  and by the superiority which they had acquired in arms, they now  ventured, under the command of Hinguar and Hubba, to leave the  sea-coast, and penetrating into Mercia, they took up their winter  quarters at Nottingham, where they threatened the kingdom with a final  subjection.         [* Asser, p. 6. Chron. Sax. p. 79.]    The Mercians, in this extremity, applied to Ethered for succor; and that  prince, with his brother Alfred, conducting a great army to Nottingham,  obliged the enemy to dislodge, and to retreat into Northumberland.  {870.} Their restless disposition, and their avidity for plunder,  allowed them not to remain long in those quarters; they broke into East  Anglia, defeated and took prisoner Edmund, the king of that country,  whom they afterwards murdered in cool blood; and, committing the most  barbarous ravages on the people, particularly on the monasteries, they  gave the East Angles cause to regret the temporary relief which they had  obtained, by assisting the common enemy.    The next station of the Danes was at Reading; whence they infested  the neighboring country by their incursions. The Mercians, desirous of  shaking off their dependence on Ethered, refused to join him with  their forces; and that prince, attended by Alfred, was obliged to march  against the enemy with the West Saxons alone, his hereditary subjects.  The Danes, being defeated in an action, shut themselves up in their  garrison; but quickly making thence an irruption, they routed the West  Saxons, and obliged them to raise the siege. An action soon after ensued  at Aston, in Berkshire, where the English, in the beginning of the day,  were in danger of a total defeat. Alfred, advancing with one division  of the army, was surrounded by the enemy in disadvantageous ground;  and Ethered, who was at that time hearing mass, refused to march to his  assistance till prayers should be finished;[*] but, as he afterwards  obtained the victory, this success, not the danger of Alfred, was  ascribed by the monks to the piety of that monarch.         [* Asser. p. 7. W. Malms, lib. ii. cap. 3 Sim.       Dunelm. p. 125. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 205.]    [Illustration: 035.jpg ALFRED BEFORE THE DANISH GENERAL]          ALFRED.    This battle of Aston did not terminate the war; another battle was a  little after fought at Basing, where the Danes were more successful; and  being reenforced by a new army from their own country, they became every  day more terrible to the English. Amidst these confusions, Ethered died  of a wound which he had received in an action with the Danes; and  left the inheritance of his cares and misfortunes, rather than of his  grandeur, to his brother Alfred, who was now twenty-two years of age.    This prince gave very early marks of those great virtues and shining  talents, by which, during the most difficult times, he saved his country  from utter ruin and subversion. Ethelwolf, his father, the year after  his return with Alfred from Rome, had again sent the young prince  thither with a numerous retinue; and a report being spread of the king's  death, the Pope, Leo III., gave Alfred the royal unction;[*] whether  prognosticating his future greatness from the appearances of his  pregnant genius, or willing to pretend, even in that age, to the right  of conferring kingdoms. Alfred, on his return home, became every day  more the object of his father's affections; but being indulged in all  youthful pleasures, he was much neglected in his education; and he had  already reached his twelfth year, when he was yet totally ignorant of  the lowest elements of literature. His genius was first roused by  the recital of Saxon poems, in which the queen took delight; and this  species of erudition, which is sometimes able to make a considerable  progress even among barbarians, expanded those noble and elevated  sentiments which he had received from nature.[**] Encouraged by the  queen, and stimulated by his own ardent inclination, he soon learned to  read those compositions; and proceeded thence to acquire the knowledge  of the Latin tongue, in which he met with authors that better prompted  his heroic spirit, and directed his generous views. Absorbed in these  elegant pursuits, he regarded his accession to royalty rather as an  object of regret than of triumph;[***] but being called to the throne,  in preference to his brother's children, as well by the will of  his father,--a circumstance which had great authority with the  Anglo-Saxons[****]--as by the vows of the whole nation, and the urgency  of public affairs, he shook off his literary indolence, and exerted  himself in the defence of his people. He had scarcely buried his  brother, when he was obliged to take the field, in order to oppose the  Danes, who had seized Wilton, and were exercising their usual ravages on  the countries around.         [* Asser. p. 2. W. Malms, lib. ii. chap. 2.       Ingulph. p. 869. Sim. Dunelm. p. 120, 139.]         [** Asser. p. 5. M. West, p. 167.]         [*** Asser. p. 7.]         [**** Asser. p. 22. Sim. Dunelm. p. 121.]    He marched against them with the few troops which he could assemble on  a sudden, and, giving them battle, gained at first an advantage;  but, by his pursuing the victory too far, the superiority of the enemy's  numbers prevailed, and recovered them the day. Their loss, however,  in the action, was so considerable, that, fearing Alfred would receive  daily reenforcements from his subjects, they were content to stipulate  for a safe retreat, and promised to depart the kingdom. For that  purpose, they were conducted to London, and allowed to take up winter  quarters there; but, careless of their engagements, they immediately  set themselves to the committing of spoil on the neighboring country.  Burrhed, king of Mercia, in whose territories London was situated, made  a new stipulation with them, and engaged them, by presents of money, to  remove to Lindesey, in Lincolnshire, a country which they had already  reduced to ruin and desolation. Finding, therefore, no object in that  place, either for their rapine or violence, they suddenly turned  back upon Mercia, in a quarter where they expected to find it without  defence; and fixing their station at Repton, in Derbyshire, they laid  the whole country desolate with fire and sword. Burrhed, despairing of  success against an enemy whom no force could resist, and no treaties  bind, abandoned his kingdom, and, flying to Rome, took shelter in a  cloister.[*] He was brother-in-law to Alfred, and the last who bore the  title of king in Mercia.    The West Saxons were now the only remaining power in England; and though  supported by the vigor and abilities of Alfred, they were unable to  sustain the efforts of those ravagers, who from all quarters invaded  them.
