The letter was written  to Mr. James Hooper, of Norwich.    [43] _Life of Frances Power Cobbe as told by Herself_, ch. xvii.          CHAPTER VIII    GEORGE BORROW'S NORWICH--THE LAWYER'S OFFICE      Doubts were very frequently expressed in Borrow's lifetime as to his  having really been articled to a solicitor, but the indefatigable Dr.  Knapp set that point at rest by reference to the Record Office. Borrow  was articled to Simpson and Rackham of Tuck's Court, St. Giles's,  Norwich, 'for the term of five years'--from March 1819 to March  1824--and these five years were spent in and about Norwich, and were  full of adventure of a kind with which the law had nothing to do. If  Borrow had had the makings of a lawyer he could not have entered the  profession under happier auspices. The firm was an old established one  even in his day. It had been established in Tuck's Court as Simpson and  Rackham, then it became Rackham and Morse, Rackham, Cooke and Rackham,  and Rackham and Cooke; finally, Tom Rackham, a famous Norwich man in his  day, moved to another office, and the firm of lawyers who occupy the  original offices in our day is called Leathes Prior and Sons. Borrow has  told us frankly what a poor lawyer's clerk he made--he was always  thinking of things remote from that profession, of gypsies, of  prize-fighters, and of word-makers. Yet he loved the head of the firm,  William Simpson, who must have been a kind and tolerant guide to the  curious youth. Simpson was for a time Town Clerk of Norwich, and his  portrait hangs in the Blackfriars Hall. Borrow went to live with Mr.  Simpson in the Upper Close near the Grammar School. Archdeacon Groome  recalled having seen Borrow 'reserved and solitary' haunting the  precincts of the playground; another schoolboy, William Drake,  remembered him as 'tall, spare, dark-complexioned.'[44] Here is Borrow's  account of his master and of his work:         A more respectable-looking individual was never seen; he really       looked what he was, a gentleman of the law--there was nothing       of the pettifogger about him: somewhat under the middle size,       and somewhat rotund in person, he was always dressed in a full       suit of black, never worn long enough to become threadbare. His       face was rubicund, and not without keenness; but the most       remarkable thing about him was the crown of his head, which was       bald, and shone like polished ivory, nothing more white,       smooth, and lustrous. Some people have said that he wore false       calves, probably because his black silk stockings never       exhibited a wrinkle; they might just as well have said that he       waddled, because his boots creaked; for these last, which were       always without a speck, and polished as his crown, though of a       different hue, did creak, as he walked rather slowly. I cannot       say that I ever saw him walk fast.         He had a handsome practice, and might have died a very rich       man, much richer than he did, had he not been in the habit of       giving rather expensive dinners to certain great people, who       gave him nothing in return, except their company; I could never       discover his reasons for doing so, as he always appeared to me       a remarkably quiet man, by nature averse to noise and bustle;       but in all dispositions there are anomalies. I have already       said that he lived in a handsome house, and I may as well here       add that he had a very handsome wife, who both dressed and       talked exceedingly well.         So I sat behind the deal desk, engaged in copying documents of       various kinds; and in the apartment in which I sat, and in the       adjoining ones, there were others, some of whom likewise copied       documents, while some were engaged in the yet more difficult       task of drawing them up; and some of these, sons of nobody,       were paid for the work they did, whilst others, like myself,       sons of somebody, paid for being permitted to work, which, as       our principal observed, was but reasonable, forasmuch as we not       unfrequently utterly spoiled the greater part of the work       intrusted to our hands.[45]    [Illustration: WILLIAM SIMPSON    From a portrait by Thomas Phillips, R.A.    Mr. Simpson was Chamberlain of the city of Norwich and Treasurer of the  county of Norfolk. He was Town-Clerk of Norwich in 1826, and has an  interest in connection with George Borrow in that Borrow was articled to  him as a lawyer's clerk and describes him in _Wild Wales_ as 'the  greatest solicitor in East Anglia--indeed I may say the prince of all  English solicitors.'    The portrait hangs in the Black Friars Hall, Norwich.]    And he goes on to tell us that he studied the Welsh language and later  the Danish; his master said that his inattention would assuredly make  him a bankrupt, and his father sighed over his eccentric and  impracticable son. The passion for languages had indeed caught hold of  Borrow. Among my Borrow papers I find a memorandum in the handwriting of  his stepdaughter in which she says:         I have often heard his mother say, that when a mere child of       eight or nine years, all his pocket-money was spent in       purchasing foreign Dictionaries and Grammars; he formed an       acquaintance with an old woman who kept a bookstall in the       market-place of Norwich, whose son went voyages to Holland with       cattle, and brought home Dutch books, which were eagerly bought       by little George. One day the old woman was crying, and told       him that her son was in prison. 'For doing what?' asked the       child. 'For taking a silk handkerchief out of a gentleman's       pocket.' 'Then,' said the boy, 'your son stole the pocket       handkerchief?' 'No dear, no, my son did not steal,--he only       glyfaked.'    We have no difficulty in recognising here the heroine of the Moll  Flanders episode in _Lavengro_. But it was not from casual meetings with  Welsh grooms and Danes and Dutchmen that Borrow acquired even such  command of various languages as was undoubtedly his. We have it on the  authority of an old fellow-pupil at the Grammar School, Burcham,  afterwards a London police-magistrate, that William Taylor gave him  lessons in German,[46] but he acquired most of his varied knowledge in  these impressionable years in the Corporation Library of Norwich. Dr.  Knapp found, in his most laudable examination of some of the books,  Borrow's neat pencil notes, the making of which was not laudable on the  part of his hero. One book here marked was on ancient Danish literature,  the author of which, Olaus Wormius, gave him the hint for calling  himself Olaus Borrow for a time--a signature that we find in some of  Borrow's published translations. Borrow at this time had aspirations of  a literary kind, and Thomas Campbell accepted a translation of  Schiller's _Diver_, which was signed 'O. B.' There were also  translations from the German, Dutch, Swedish, and Danish, in the  _Monthly Magazine_. Clearly Borrow was becoming a formidable linguist,  if not a very exact master of words. Still he remained a vagabond, and  loved to wander over Mousehold Heath, to the gypsy encampment, and to  make friends with the Romany folk; he loved also to haunt the horse  fairs for which Norwich was so celebrated; and he was not averse from  the companionship of wilder spirits who loved pugilism, if we may trust  _Lavengro_, and if we may assume, as we justly may, that he many times  cast youthful, sympathetic eyes on John Thurtell in these years, the  to-be murderer of Weare, then actually living with his father in a house  on the Ipswich Road, Thurtell, the father, being in no mean position in  the city--an alderman, and a sheriff in 1815. Yes, there was plenty to  do and to see in Norwich, and Borrow's memories of it were nearly always  kindly:         A fine old city, truly, is that, view it from whatever side you       will; but it shows best from the east, where ground, bold and       elevated, overlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it       stands. Gazing from those heights, the eye beholds a scene       which cannot fail to awaken, even in the least sensitive bosom,       feelings of pleasure and admiration. At the foot of the heights       flows a narrow and deep river, with an antique bridge       communicating with a long and narrow suburb, flanked on either       side by rich meadows of the brightest green, beyond which       spreads the city; the fine old city, perhaps the most curious       specimen at present extant of the genuine old English town.       Yes, there it spreads from north to south, with its venerable       houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its       mighty mound, which, if tradition speaks true, was raised by       human hands to serve as the grave-heap of an old heathen king,       who sits deep within it, with his sword in his hand, and his       gold and silver treasures about him. There is a grey old castle       upon the top of that mighty mound; and yonder, rising three       hundred feet above the soil, from among those noble forest       trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-encircled       cathedral spire, around which a garrulous army of rooks and       choughs continually wheel their flight. Now, who can wonder       that the children of that fine old city are proud of her, and       offer up prayers for her prosperity? I myself, who was not born       within her walls, offer up prayers for her prosperity, that       want may never visit her cottages, vice her palaces, and that       the abomination of idolatry may never pollute her temples.    But at the very centre of Borrow's Norwich life was William Taylor,  concerning whom we have already written much. It was a Jew named Mousha,  a quack it appears, who pretended to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1980"],[0,"Stories (#18)"],[1,"unable to  satisfy each of them, Miss Musgrave turned for help to the Scholar,  whom she appeared to regard as her special adviser; and he, promising a  solution of the difficulty in half an hour, drew off the whole crowd to  the American Bar, where the question was thrashed out in all its points.    It was clearly evident that Miss Musgrave could not surrender to each  individual the whole of her evening, even if any one had been willing to  let his neighbor monopolise it, which no one was; and therefore it  was necessary to formulate some scheme by which her talents might be  distributed over a larger area. But what the scheme should be was not  settled all in a minute. One man wanted to hear her sing, another to  hear her talk, another was willing to give five pounds an hour for the  privilege of talking to her. After a lengthened discussion, which was  excited throughout, and at times verged on the warlike, it was  decided to effect a compromise--subject, of course, to Miss Musgrave's  inclinations; and a deputation was sent to learn her views on the  subject.    There was no assembly-room in the place, excepting Werstein's  saloon,--which, of course, was not available for such a purpose,--and so  it was proposed to her, with much humility, that she should take up her  position in the evenings on a chair outside her hut, and there discourse  such vocal and instrumental music as she saw fit, interlarding the  same with friendly conversation. What was she to talk about?  Anything--absolutely anything. They didn't mind what it was, so long as  they heard her voice. Five shillings, the committee had decided, was to  be paid by every man who came within earshot. And any one who wanted a  free list was requested to argue the matter out with Euchre Buck.    This call upon her powers seemed to take Miss Musgrave aback.    \"I have never sung in public,\" she pleaded, rather nervously. \"Indeed,  my voice is not good enough for it; really it isn't. Only I thought  I could teach a little perhaps, and that is why I came here. You see,  mother, is an invalid, and we were so very poor that--\"    \"Miss,\" broke in Jockey Bill, \"call it ten bob a 'ead, an' just 'um to  us.\"    \"Oh no, Mr. William, it was not the money that I thought about; indeed,  five shillings would be far too much. But if you think that I should be  able to amuse you at all, I would do my very best--believe me, I would.\"    \"Miss,\" growled Dan, with a clumsy endeavour to chase away her  diffidence, \"all we asks is fer you to sit near us fer a spell. Ef you  sings or plays, we'd be proud; ef you just looks an' talks, we'd be  pleased.\"    So in the end Miss Musgrave yielded to the wishes of the community, and  the nightly conclave in the American Bar became so much a thing of the  past that Gustav Werstein was heard to threaten another emigration. The  songs were to the diggers new, and yet not new. There was nothing of the  music-hall type about them; they were nearly all old-fashioned ditties.  She sang to them of \"Barbara Allen\" and \"Sally in our Alley\"; she  gave them \"Cheer, Boys, Cheer,\" and called for a chorus; she sang \"The  Message,\" \"The Arrow and the Song\"; and she brought back memories of  other days when Africa was to them a mere geographical expression--of  days when that something had not happened which had sent them away from  home.    Sunday came, the fifth day after her arrival, and it differed from the  usual Sabbath of Big Stone Hole. Sunday had been observed before by  the biggest drinking bout of the week, and a summary settlement of the  previous six days' disputes. Now, to the huge surprise of the Kaffirs,  and to the still greater surprise of themselves, these diamond-diggers  sang hymns at intervals during the day, and refrained from indulging in  the orthodox carouse till after Miss Musgrave had retired for the night.  It was a wonderful change.    During the next week a fall of earth took place in Tommy Dartmoor's  claim. Two Kaffirs were killed; and when the proprietor himself was  extricated from the debris of blue clay which held him down, he was  found to have a broken arm, besides other serious injuries.    \"Don't let on to her,\" he managed to gasp out to his rescuers, wishing  to spare Miss Musgrave's nerves a shock.    But she saw the men bearing him to his hut, joined them, and insisted on  being installed as sole nurse forthwith.    Twenty other men would willingly have broken an arm for such a reward;  and the recklessness displayed during the next few days was something  awful. But she saw that too,--little escaped those big blue eyes,--and,  ascribing it to drink, gave a pretty strong lecture on the bibulous  habits of Big Stone Hole, at her next concert.    There was an earnest meeting in the American Bar that night, at which  the following motion was put and carried unanimously: \"On and after this  date, any drunken man is liable to be shot at sight, unless his friends  can prove that he has dug over three carats of diamonds during the day.\"  And then, like other reformers, they went on to more sweeping measures:  \"Only knife-fighting to take place in the camp. All disputes with  pistols, unless of a very pressing nature, to be settled out of earshot  of Dan's house.\" There were even some hints of appointing a closing-time  for the saloon--\"it would make the place so much more like home.\" But  the promoter eventually withdrew his suggestion, as it was justly felt  that such a motion would interfere with the liberty of the subject too  much. But a storm of cheers burst forth when it was proposed to  transfer the diamond-safe from Werstein's keeping to a corner of the new  goddess's shrine.    Even Satan, the cat, joined in the general adoration, and, more favoured  than the rest, enjoyed at times a chaste salute from Miss Musgrave's  ripe-red lips.    Never, in so short a space of time, had a community been more changed  for the better than was that of Big Stone Hole. Never had woman's  humanising influence made itself more clearly felt. The azure cloud  of blasphemy that hung over the workings and the rest of the camp was  replaced again by the normal dust. Each man tried to beautify the inside  of his shanty to the best of his means and ideas, for there was no  knowing when the only \"she\" would take it into her pretty, capricious  head to pay a call. In this latter line the Scholar had a decided pull.  Education had taught him taste; necessity, handiness; and by aid of  the two he transformed his rude dwelling into something approaching the  rooms in which he used to dawdle away the happy hours, time ago. It was  partly drawing-room, partly curiosity-shop. Cups, saucers, and spoons  appeared as if by magicians' call, and one blazing afternoon the news  flashed round the diamond-pits that Miss Musgrave was \"taking afternoon  tea with the Scholar.\" But when the Scholar saw the dismay his simple  act had spread around him, he dissipated it with a kindly laugh and a  few reassuring words.    \"Don't mind me, boys. I was only doing the civil in a purely platonic  manner. Miss Musgrave is nothing to me, nor am I anything to her. Heaven  forbid! I'm too hard a bargain for any girl. If any one of you marries  her I'll act as his best man if he asks me to, and wish him every  felicity without a thought of regret.\"    \"Bully for the Scholar!\" yelled the delighted crowd; and Miss Musgrave's  smiles were more sought after than ever.    So things went on day after day, week after week, till Miss Musgrave  became little short of an autocratic empress. But still she showed no  signs of taking unto herself a consort; she kept all men at a cousinly  distance, and those who felt intimate enough to address her as \"Miss  Mary\" accounted themselves uncommonly fortunate. Thus the little machine  of state worked perfectly harmoniously, and Big Stone Hole was as steady  and prosperous a settlement as need be.    Had these diggers refreshed their minds by looking back for historical  parallels, they might have been prepared in some degree for Miss  Musgrave's exit from among them, but as none of them indulged in such  retrospections the manner of it took the camp somewhat by surprise.    It was first discovered in this wise. Work was over for the day. The  Kaffirs had been searched and had returned to their kraal. Pipes  were being lit after the evening meal, and a picturesque assembly was  grouping itself in an expectant semicircle on the sun-baked turf in  front of Miss Musgrave's dwelling. She was usually outside to welcome  the first comers, and her absence naturally formed the staple topic  of conversation. Digger after digger arrived, threw himself down, and  joined in the general wonderment as to why Miss Mary wasn't there, and  at last some one hazarded a suggestion that she \"must be asleep.\" There  was a general epidemic of noisy coughing for a full minute, and then  silence for another, but no sound from within the hut.    \"Perhaps she's ill,\" was the next surmise.    After the etiquette to be followed had been strictly discussed, and a  rigid course of procedure set down, the Scholar got up and knocked at  the door. He received no answer, and so knocked again--knocked several  times, in fact, and then rattled the handle vigorously, but without  result.    \"Better open it,\" said a voice.    And he did so; and after looking inside, announced:    \"She's not there.\"    At this moment Dan came up.    \"My ole mar' 's gone,\" he said; \"an' she ain't stampeded, neither, but  was stole. Tote-rope's been untied, an' saddle an' bridle took as well.\"    There was uncomfortable silence, which the Scholar broke by a low,  long-drawn whistle.    \"Boys,\" said he, \"let's look inside the safe.\"    The three men who held the keys brought them up, the bolts were shot,  and the massive door swung back. There was every man's little sack with  his name on it; but somehow or other the sacks looked limper than of  yore. Each one was eagerly"]]]
