You see, we'd but two or three neighbors,    And the nearest was more than a mile;  And we hadn't found time yet to know them,    For we had been busy the while.  And the man who had helped at the raising    Just staid till the job was well done;  And as soon as his money was paid him    Had shouldered his axe and had gone.    Well, husband just kissed me and started--    I could scarcely suppress a deep groan  At the thought of remaining with baby    So long in the house alone;  For, my dear, I was childish and timid,    And braver ones might well have feared,  For the wild wolf was often heard howling.    And savages sometimes appeared.    But I smothered my grief and my terror    Till husband was off on his ride,  And then in my arms I took Josey,    And all the day long sat and cried,  As I thought of the long, dreary hours    When the darkness of night should fall,  And I was so utterly helpless,    With no one in reach of my call.    And when the night came with its terrors,    To hide ev'ry ray of light,  I hung up a quilt by the window,    And, almost dead with affright,  I kneeled by the side of the cradle,    Scarce daring to draw a full breath,  Lest the baby should wake, and its crying    Should bring us a horrible death.    There I knelt until late in the evening    And scarcely an inch had I stirred,  When suddenly, far in the distance,    A sound as of whistling I heard.  I started up dreadfully frightened,    For fear 'twas an Indian's call;  And then very soon I remembered    The red man ne'er whistles at all.    And when I was sure 'twas a white man,    I thought, were he coming for ill,  He'd surely approach with more caution--    Would come without warning, and still.  Then the sound, coming nearer and nearer,    Took the form of a tune light and gay,  And I knew I needn't fear evil    From one who could whistle that way.    Very soon I heard footsteps approaching,    Then came a peculiar dull thump,  As if some one was heavily striking    An ax in the top of a stump;  And then, in another brief moment,    There came a light tap on the door,  When quickly I undid the fast'ning,    And in stepped a boy, and before    There was either a question or answer    Or either had time to speak,  I just threw my glad arms around him,    And gave him a kiss on the cheek.  Then I started back, scared at my boldness.    But he only smiled at my fright,  As he said, \"I'm your neighbor's boy, Ellick,    Come to tarry with you through the night.    \"We saw your husband go eastward,    And made up our minds where he'd gone,  And I said to the rest of our people,    'That woman is there all alone,  And I venture she's awfully lonesome,    And though she may have no great fear,  I think she would feel a bit safer    If only a boy were but near.'    \"So, taking my axe on my shoulder,    For fear that a savage might stray  Across my path and need scalping,    I started right down this way;  And coming in sight of the cabin,    And thinking to save you alarm,  I whistled a tune, just to show you    I didn't intend any harm.    \"And so here I am, at your service;    But if you don't want me to stay,  Why, all you need do is to say so,    And should'ring my axe, I'll away.\"  I dropped in a chair and near fainted,    Just at thought of his leaving me then,  And his eye gave a knowing bright twinkle    As he said, \"I guess I'll remain.\"    And then I just sat there and told him    How terribly frightened I'd been,  How his face was to me the most welcome    Of any I ever had seen;  And then I lay down with the baby,    And slept all the blessed night through,  For I felt I was safe from all danger    Near so brave a young fellow, and true.    So now, my dear friend, do you wonder,    Since such a good reason I've given,  Why I say I sha'n't care for the music,    Unless there is whistling in heaven?  Yes, often I've said so in earnest,    And now what I've said I repeat,  That unless there's a boy there a-whistling,    Its music will not be complete.          Sleep, Baby, Sleep            Sleep, baby, sleep!  Thy father's watching the sheep,  Thy mother's shaking the dreamland tree,  And down drops a little dream for thee.        Sleep, baby, sleep!          Sleep, baby, sleep!  The large stars are the sheep,  The little stars are the lambs, I guess,  The bright moon is the shepherdess.        Sleep, baby, sleep!          Sleep, baby, sleep!  Thy Savior loves His sheep;  He is the Lamb of God on high  Who for our sakes came down to die.        Sleep, baby, sleep!        _Elizabeth Prentiss._          The Lost Chord      Seated one day at the organ,    I was weary and ill at ease,  And my fingers wandered idly    Over the noisy keys.    I do not know what I was playing,    Or what I was dreaming then;  But I struck one chord of music,    Like the sound of a great Amen.    It flooded the crimson twilight,    Like the close of an angel's psalm;  And it lay on my fevered spirit    With a touch of infinite calm.    It quieted pain and sorrow,    Like love overcoming strife;  It seemed the harmonious echo    From our discordant life.    It linked all perplexing meanings    Into one perfect peace,  And trembled away into silence    As if it were loth to cease.    I have sought, but I seek it vainly,    That one lost chord divine,  That came from the soul of the organ,    And entered into mine.    It may be that Death's bright angel    Will speak in that chord again;  It may be that only in Heaven    I shall hear that grand Amen.        _Adelaide A. Procter._          The Children's Hour      Between the dark and the daylight,    When the night is beginning to lower,  Comes a pause in the day's occupations,    That is known as the Children's Hour.    I hear in the chamber above me    The patter of little feet,  The sound of a door that is opened,    And voices soft and sweet.    From my study I see in the lamplight,    Descending the broad hall stair,  Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra,    And Edith with golden hair.    A whisper, and then a silence:    Yet I know by their merry eyes  They are plotting and planning together    To take me by surprise.    A sudden rush from the stairway,    A sudden raid from the hall!  By three doors left unguarded    They enter my castle wall!    They climb up into my turret    O'er the arms and back of my chair;  If I try to escape, they surround me;    They seem to be everywhere.    They almost devour me with kisses,    Their arms about me entwine,  Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen    In his Mouse-tower on the Rhine!    Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,    Because you have scaled the wall,  Such an old mustache as I am    Is not a match for you all!    I have you fast in my fortress,    And will not let you depart,  But put you down into the dungeon    In the round-tower of my heart.    And there will I keep you forever,    Yes, forever and a day,  Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,    And moulder in dust away!        _Henry W. Longfellow._          Woodman, Spare That Tree!      Woodman, spare that tree!    Touch not a single bough!  In youth it sheltered me,    And I'll protect it now.  'T was my forefather's hand    That placed it near his cot;  There, woodman, let it stand.    Thy ax shall harm it not!    That old familiar tree,    Whose glory and renown  Are spread o'er land and sea--    And wouldst thou hew it down?  Woodman, forbear thy stroke!    Cut not its earth-bound ties;  Oh, spare that aged oak,    Now towering to the skies!    When but an idle boy,    I sought its grateful shade;  In all their gushing joy    Here, too, my sisters played.  My mother kissed me here;    My father pressed my hand--  Forgive this foolish tear,    But let that old oak stand!    My heart-strings round thee cling,    Close as thy bark, old friend!  Here shall the wild-bird sing,    And still thy branches bend.  Old tree! the storm still brave!    And, woodman, leave the spot;  While I've a hand to save,    Thy ax shall harm it not!        _George Pope Morris_.          Little Brown Hands      They drive home the cows from the pasture,    Up through the long shady lane,  Where the quail whistles loud in the wheat-fields,    That are yellow with ripening grain.  They find, in the thick waving grasses,    Where the scarlet-lipped strawberry grows.  They gather the earliest snowdrops,    And the first crimson buds of the rose.    They toss the new hay in the meadow,    They gather the elder-bloom white,  They find where the dusky grapes purple    In the soft-tinted October light.  They know where the apples hang ripest,    And are sweeter than Italy's wines;  They know where the fruit hangs the thickest    On the long, thorny blackberry vines.    They gather the delicate sea-weeds,    And build tiny castles of sand;  They pick up the beautiful sea shells--    Fairy barks that have drifted to land.  They wave from the tall, rocking tree-tops,    Where the oriole's hammock-nest swings,  And at night time are folded in slumber    By a song that a fond mother sings.    Those who toil bravely are strongest;    The humble and poor become great;  And so from these brown-handed children    Shall grow mighty rulers of state.  The pen of the author and statesman,--    The noble and wise of the land,--  The sword, and the chisel, and palette,    Shall be held in the little brown hand.        _Mary H. Krout._          Barbara Frietchie      Up from the meadows rich with corn  Clear in the cool September morn,    The clustered spires of Frederick stand  Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.

In  the last journey some of the worst cases got put into the top bunks, in  the darkness and rush, and one only had candles to do the dressings by.  One of the C.S.'s was on leave, but has come back now. All the trains  just then had bad loads: the Clearing Hospitals were overflowing.    The Xmas Cards have come, and I'm going to risk keeping them till  Friday, in case we have patients on the train. If not, I shall take them  to a Sister I know at one of the B. hospitals.    We have got some H.A.C. on this time, who try to stand up when you come  in, as if you were coming into their drawing-room. The Tommies in the  same carriage are quite embarrassed. One boy said just now, \"We 'ad a  'appy Xmas last year.\"    \"Where?\" I said.    \"At 'ome, 'long o' Mother,\" he said, beaming.      _Xmas Eve, 1914._--And no fire and no chauffage, and cotton frocks;  funny life, isn't it? And the men are crouching in a foot of water in  the trenches and thinking of \"'ome, 'long o' Mother,\"--British, Germans,  French, and Russians. We are just up at Chocques going to load up with  Indians again. Had more journeys this week than for a long time; you  just get time to get what sleep the engine-driver and the cold will  allow you on the way up.    8 P.M.--Just nearing Boulogne with another bad load, half Indian, half  British; had it in daylight for the most part, thank goodness! Railhead  to-day was one station further back than last time, as the ----  Headquarters had to be evacuated after the Germans got through on  Sunday. The two regiments, Coldstream Guards and Camerons, who drove  them back, lost heavily and tell a tragic story. There are two men (only  one is a boy) on the train who got wounded on Monday night (both  compound fracture of the thigh) and were only taken out of the trench  this morning, Thursday, to a Dressing Station and then straight on to  our train. (We heard the guns this morning.) Why they are alive I don't  know, but I'm afraid they won't live long: they are sunken and  grey-faced and just strong enough to say, \"Anyway, I'm out of the trench  now.\" They had drinks of water now and then in the field but no  dressings, and lay in the slush. Stretcher-bearers are shot down  immediately, with or without the wounded, by the German snipers.    And this is Christmas, and the world is supposed to be civilised. They  came in from the trenches to-day with blue faces and chattering teeth,  and it was all one could do to get them warm and fed. By this evening  they were most of them revived enough to enjoy Xmas cards; there were  such a nice lot that they were able to choose them to send to Mother and  My Young Lady and the Missis and the Children, and have one for  themselves.    The Indians each had one, and salaamed and said, \"God save you,\" and \"I  will pray to God for you,\" and \"God win your enemies,\" and \"God kill  many Germans,\" and \"The Indian men too cold, kill more Germans if not  too cold.\" One with a S.A. ribbon spotted mine and said, \"Africa same  like you.\"    _Midnight._--Just unloaded, going to turn in; we are to go off again at  5 A.M. to-morrow, so there'll be no going to church. Mail in, but not  parcels; there's a big block of parcels down at the base, and we may get  them by Easter.    With superhuman self-control I have not opened my mail to-night so as to  have it to-morrow morning.      _Xmas Day_, 11 A.M.--On way up again to Bethune, where we have not been  before (about ten miles beyond where we were yesterday), a place I've  always hoped to see. Sharp white frost, fog becoming denser as we get  nearer Belgium. A howling mob of reinforcements stormed the train for  smokes. We threw out every cigarette, pipe, pair of socks, mits,  hankies, pencils we had left; it was like feeding chickens, but of  course we hadn't nearly enough.    Every one on the train has had a card from the King and Queen in a  special envelope with the Royal Arms in red on it. And this is the  message (in writing hand)--         \"_With our best wishes for Christmas, 1914._         _May God protect you and bring you home safe._         MARY R. GEORGE R.I.\"    That is something to keep, isn't it?    An officer has just told us that those men haven't had a cigarette since  they left S'hampton, hard luck. I wish we'd had enough for them. It is  the smokes and the rum ration that has helped the British Army to stick  it more than anything, after the conviction that they've each one got  that the Germans have got to be \"done in\" in the end. A Sergt. of the  C.G. told me a cheering thing yesterday. He said he had a draft of young  soldiers of only four months' service in this week's business. \"Talk of  old soldiers,\" he said, \"you'd have thought these had had years of it.  When they were ordered to advance there was no stopping them.\"    After all we are not going to Bethune but to Merville again.    This is a very slow journey up, with long indefinite stops; we all got  bad headaches by lunch time from the intense cold and a short night  following a heavy day. At lunch we had hot bricks for our feet, and hot  food inside, which improved matters, and I think by the time we get the  patients on there will be chauffage.    The orderlies are to have their Xmas dinner to-morrow, but I believe  ours is to be to-night, if the patients are settled up in time.    Do not think from these details that we are at all miserable; we say  \"For King and Country\" at intervals, and have many jokes over it all,  and there is the never-failing game of going over what we'll all do and  avoid doing After the War.    7 P.M.--Loaded up at Merville and now on the way back; not many badly  wounded but a great many minor medicals, crocked up, nothing much to be  done for them. We may have to fill up at Hazebrouck, which will  interrupt the very festive Xmas dinner the French Staff are getting  ready for us. It takes a man, French or British, to take decorating  really seriously. The orderlies have done wonders with theirs.  Aeroplanes done in cotton-wool on brown blankets is one feature.    This lot of patients had Xmas dinner in their Clearing Hospitals to-day,  and the King's Xmas card, and they will get Princess Mary's present.  Here they finished up D.'s Xmas cards and had oranges and bananas, and  hot chicken broth directly they got in.    _12 Midnight._--Still on the road. We had a very festive Xmas dinner,  going to the wards which were in charge of nursing orderlies between the  courses. Soup, turkey, peas, mince pie, plum pudding, chocolate,  champagne, absinthe, and coffee. Absinthe is delicious, like squills. We  had many toasts in French and English. The King, the President, Absent  Friends, Soldiers and Sailors, and I had the _Blesses_ and the  _Malades_. We got up and clinked glasses with the French Staff at every  toast, and finally the little chef came in and sang to us in a very  sweet musical tenor. Our great anxiety is to get as many orderlies and  N.C.O.'s as possible through the day without being run in for drunk, but  it is an uphill job; I don't know where they get it.    We are wondering what the chances are of getting to bed to-night.    4 A.M.--Very late getting in to B.; not unloading till morning. Just  going to turn in now till breakfast time. End of Xmas Day.      _Saturday, December 26th._--Saw my lambs off the train before  breakfast. One man in the Warwicks had twelve years' service, a wife and  two children, but \"when Kitchener wanted more men\" he re-joined. This  week he got an explosive bullet through his arm, smashing it up to rags  above the elbow. He told me he got a man \"to tie the torn muscles up,\"  and then started to crawl out, dragging his arm behind him. After some  hours he came upon one of his own officers wounded, who said, \"Good God,  sonny, you'll be bleeding to death if we don't get you out of this;  catch hold of me and the Chaplain.\" \"So 'e cuddled me, and I cuddled the  Chaplain, and we got as far as the doctor.\"    At the Clearing H. his arm was taken off through the shoulder-joint, but  I'm afraid it is too late. He is now a pallid wreck, dying of gangrene.  But he would discuss the War, and when it would end, and ask when he'd  be strong enough to sit up and write to that officer, and apologised for  wanting drinks so often. He is one of the most top-class gallant  gentlemen it's ever been my jolly good luck to meet. And there are  hundreds of them.    We had Princess Mary's nice brass box this morning. The V.A.D. here  brought a present to every man on the train this morning, and to the  orderlies. They had 25,000 to distribute, cigarette-cases,  writing-cases, books, pouches, &c. The men were frightfully pleased, it  was so unexpected. The processions of hobbling, doubled-up, silent,  muddy, sitting-up cases who pour out of the trains want something to  cheer them up, as well as the lying-downs. It is hard to believe they  are the fighting men, now they've handed their rifles and bandoliers in.  (It is snowing fast.) We have to go and drink the men's health at their  spread at 1 o'clock. Then I hope a spell of sleep.    We have chauffage on to-day to thaw the froidage; the pipes are frozen.    6 P.M.--We all processed to the Orderlies' Mess truck and the O.C. made  a speech, and the Q.M.S. dished out drinks for us to toast with, and we  had the King and all of ourselves with great enthusiasm. Mr T. had to  propose \"The Sisters,\" and after a few trembling, solemn words about \"we  all know the good work they do,\" he suddenly giggled hopelessly, and it  ended in a healthy splodge all round. Orders just come to be at St Omer  by 10 P.M. If that means loading-up further on about 1 A.M. I think we  shall all die! Too noisy here to sleep this afternoon. And the men are  just now so merry with Tipperary, and dressing up, that they will surely  drop the patients off the stretchers, but we'll hope for the best.      _Sunday, December 27th._--Had a grand"]]]
