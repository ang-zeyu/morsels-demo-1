[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#18)"],[1,"remind me of the narrowest I have ever  seen, the little lanes of Genoa.  The average construction of Salford is  in this respect much worse than that of Manchester, and so, too, in  respect to cleanliness.  If, in Manchester, the police, from time to  time, every six or ten years, makes a raid upon the working-people's  districts, closes the worst dwellings, and causes the filthiest spots in  these Augean stables to be cleansed, in Salford it seems to have done  absolutely nothing.  The narrow side lanes and courts of Chapel Street,  Greengate, and Gravel Lane have certainly never been cleansed since they  were built.  Of late, the Liverpool railway has been carried through the  middle of them, over a high viaduct, and has abolished many of the  filthiest nooks; but what does that avail?  Whoever passes over this  viaduct and looks down, sees filth and wretchedness enough; and, if any  one takes the trouble to pass through these lanes, and glance through the  open doors and windows into the houses and cellars, he can convince  himself afresh with every step that the workers of Salford live in  dwellings in which cleanliness and comfort are impossible.  Exactly the  same state of affairs is found in the more distant regions of Salford, in  Islington, along Regent Road, and back of the Bolton railway.  The  working-men's dwellings between Oldfield Road and Cross Lane, where a  mass of courts and alleys are to be found in the worst possible state,  vie with the dwellings of the Old Town in filth and overcrowding.  In  this district I found a man, apparently about sixty years old, living in  a cow stable.  He had constructed a sort of chimney for his square pen,  which had neither windows, floor, nor ceiling, had obtained a bedstead  and lived there, though the rain dripped through his rotten roof.  This  man was too old and weak for regular work, and supported himself by  removing manure with a hand-cart; the dung-heaps lay next door to his  palace!    Such are the various working-people's quarters of Manchester as I had  occasion to observe them personally during twenty months.  If we briefly  formulate the result of our wanderings, we must admit that 350,000  working-people of Manchester and its environs live, almost all of them,  in wretched, damp, filthy cottages, that the streets which surround them  are usually in the most miserable and filthy condition, laid out without  the slightest reference to ventilation, with reference solely to the  profit secured by the contractor.  In a word, we must confess that in the  working-men's dwellings of Manchester, no cleanliness, no convenience,  and consequently no comfortable family life is possible; that in such  dwellings only a physically degenerate race, robbed of all humanity,  degraded, reduced morally and physically to bestiality, could feel  comfortable and at home.  And I am not alone in making this assertion.  We  have seen that Dr. Kay gives precisely the same description; and, though  it is superfluous, I quote further the words of a Liberal, {63}  recognised and highly valued as an authority by the manufacturers, and a  fanatical opponent of all independent movements of the workers:    \"As I passed through the dwellings of the mill hands in Irish Town,  Ancoats, and Little Ireland, I was only amazed that it is possible to  maintain a reasonable state of health in such homes.  These towns, for in  extent and number of inhabitants they are towns, have been erected with  the utmost disregard of everything except the immediate advantage of the  speculating builder.  A carpenter and builder unite to buy a series of  building sites (_i.e_., they lease them for a number of years), and cover  them with so-called houses.  In one place we found a whole street  following the course of a ditch, because in this way deeper cellars could  be secured without the cost of digging, cellars not for storing wares or  rubbish, but for dwellings for human beings.  _Not one house of this  street escaped the cholera_.  In general, the streets of these suburbs  are unpaved, with a dung-heap or ditch in the middle; the houses are  built back to back, without ventilation or drainage, and whole families  are limited to a corner of a cellar or a garret.\"  I have already  referred to the unusual activity which the sanitary police manifested  during the cholera visitation.  When the epidemic was approaching, a  universal terror seized the bourgeoisie of the city.  People remembered  the unwholesome dwellings of the poor, and trembled before the certainty  that each of these slums would become a centre for the plague, whence it  would spread desolation in all directions through the houses of the  propertied class.  A Health Commission was appointed at once to  investigate these districts, and report upon their condition to the Town  Council.  Dr. Kay, himself a member of this Commission, who visited in  person every separate police district except one, the eleventh, quotes  extracts from their reports: There were inspected, in all, 6,951  houses--naturally in Manchester proper alone, Salford and the other  suburbs being excluded.  Of these, 6,565 urgently needed whitewashing  within; 960 were out of repair; 939 had insufficient drains; 1,435 were  damp; 452 were badly ventilated; 2,221 were without privies.  Of the 687  streets inspected, 248 were unpaved, 53 but partially paved, 112  ill-ventilated, 352 containing standing pools, heaps of debris, refuse,  etc.  To cleanse such an Augean stable before the arrival of the cholera  was, of course, out of the question.  A few of the worst nooks were  therefore cleansed, and everything else left as before.  In the cleansed  spots, as Little Ireland proves, the old filthy condition was naturally  restored in a couple of months.  As to the internal condition of these  houses, the same Commission reports a state of things similar to that  which we have already met with in London, Edinburgh, and other cities.  {64}    It often happens that a whole Irish family is crowded into one bed; often  a heap of filthy straw or quilts of old sacking cover all in an  indiscriminate heap, where all alike are degraded by want, stolidity, and  wretchedness.  Often the inspectors found, in a single house, two  families in two rooms.  All slept in one, and used the other as a kitchen  and dining-room in common.  Often more than one family lived in a single  damp cellar, in whose pestilent atmosphere twelve to sixteen persons were  crowded together.  To these and other sources of disease must be added  that pigs were kept, and other disgusting things of the most revolting  kind were found.    We must add that many families, who had but one room for themselves,  receive boarders and lodgers in it, that such lodgers of both sexes by no  means rarely sleep in the same bed with the married couple; and that the  single case of a man and his wife and his adult sister-in-law sleeping in  one bed was found, according to the \"Report concerning the sanitary  condition of the working-class,\" six times repeated in Manchester.  Common  lodging-houses, too, are very numerous; Dr. Kay gives their number in  1831 at 267 in Manchester proper, and they must have increased greatly  since then.  Each of these receives from twenty to thirty guests, so that  they shelter all told, nightly, from five to seven thousand human beings.  The character of the houses and their guests is the same as in other  cities.  Five to seven beds in each room lie on the floor--without  bedsteads, and on these sleep, mixed indiscriminately, as many persons as  apply.  What physical and moral atmosphere reigns in these holes I need  not state.  Each of these houses is a focus of crime, the scene of deeds  against which human nature revolts, which would perhaps never have been  executed but for this forced centralisation of vice. {65}  Gaskell gives  the number of persons living in cellars in Manchester proper as 20,000.  The _Weekly Dispatch_ gives the number, \"according to official reports,\"  as twelve per cent. of the working-class, which agrees with Gaskell's  number; the workers being estimated at 175,000, 21,000 would form twelve  per cent. of it.  The cellar dwellings in the suburbs are at least as  numerous, so that the number of persons living in cellars in  Manchester--using its name in the broader sense--is not less than forty  to fifty thousand.  So much for the dwellings of the workers in the  largest cities and towns.  The manner in which the need of a shelter is  satisfied furnishes a standard for the manner in which all other  necessities are supplied.  That in these filthy holes a ragged, ill-fed  population alone can dwell is a safe conclusion, and such is the fact.  The clothing of the working-people, in the majority of cases, is in a  very bad condition.  The material used for it is not of the best adapted.  Wool and linen have almost vanished from the wardrobe of both sexes, and  cotton has taken their place.  Shirts are made of bleached or coloured  cotton goods; the dresses of the women are chiefly of cotton print goods,  and woollen petticoats are rarely to be seen on the washline.  The men  wear chiefly trousers of fustian or other heavy cotton goods, and jackets  or coats of the same.  Fustian has become the proverbial costume of the  working-men, who are called \"fustian jackets,\" and call themselves so in  contrast to the gentlemen who wear broadcloth, which latter words are  used as characteristic for the middle-class.  When Feargus O'Connor, the  Chartist leader, came to Manchester during the insurrection of 1842, he  appeared, amidst the deafening applause of the working-men, in a fustian  suit of clothing.  Hats are the universal head-covering in England, even  for working-men, hats of the most diverse forms, round, high,  broad-brimmed, narrow-brimmed, or without brims--only the younger men in  factory towns wearing caps.  Any one who does not own a hat folds himself  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#18)"],[1,"to such a pass that there loomed the threat of imminent strife and  bloodshed. Of necessity, therefore, and for the protection of the servants  of God, a few of them appealed to the Governor of 'Iraq.(29)    208 Wert thou to observe these events with the eye of fairness, it would  become clear and evident in the luminous mirror of thine heart that what  occurred was called for by the circumstances, and that no other  alternative could be seen. His Majesty himself is witness that in whatever  city a number of this people have resided, the hostility of certain  functionaries hath enkindled the flame of conflict and contention. This  evanescent Soul, however, hath, since His arrival in 'Iraq, forbidden all  to engage in dissension and strife. The witness of this Servant is His  very deeds, for all are well aware and will testify that, although a  greater number of this people resided in 'Iraq than in any other land, no  one overstepped his limits or transgressed against his neighbour. Fixing  their gaze upon God, and reposing their trust in Him, all have now been  abiding in peace for well-nigh fifteen years, and, in whatever hath  befallen them, they have shown forth patience and resigned themselves to  God.    209 After the arrival of this Servant in this, the city of Adrianople,  some of the people of 'Iraq and elsewhere inquired about the meaning of  the term \"rendering assistance unto God\" which hath been mentioned in the  Holy Scriptures. Several answers were sent out in reply, one of which is  set forth in these pages, that it may be clearly demonstrated in the court  of thy presence that this Servant hath had no end in view but to promote  the betterment and well-being of the world. And if certain of the divine  favours which, undeserving as I may be, God hath pleased to bestow upon Me  be not plain and manifest, this much at least will be clear and apparent,  that He, in His surpassing mercy and infinite grace, hath not deprived  Mine heart of the ornament of reason. The passage that was referred to  concerning the meaning of \"rendering assistance unto God\" is as follows:                          _He is God, exalted be His glory!_        210 It is clear and evident that the one true God--glorified be His      mention!--is sanctified above the world and all that is therein. By      \"rendering assistance unto God\", then, it is not meant that any      soul should fight or contend with another. That Sovereign Lord Who      doeth whatsoever He pleaseth hath entrusted the kingdom of      creation, its lands and its seas, into the hands of the kings, for      they are, each according to his degree, the manifestations of His      divine power. Should they enter beneath the shadow of the True      One, they will be accounted of God, and if not, thy Lord, verily,      knoweth and observeth all things.        211 That which God--glorified be His Name!--hath desired for Himself      is the hearts of His servants, which are the treasuries of His      love and remembrance and the repositories of His knowledge and      wisdom. It hath ever been the wish of the Eternal King to cleanse      the hearts of His servants from the things of the world and all      that pertaineth thereunto, that they may be made worthy recipients      of the effulgent splendours of Him Who is the King of all names      and attributes. Wherefore must no stranger be allowed in the city      of the heart, that the incomparable Friend may enter His abode. By      this is meant the effulgence of His names and attributes, and not      His exalted Essence, inasmuch as that peerless King hath ever      been, and shall eternally remain, sanctified above ascent and      descent.        212 It followeth, therefore, that rendering assistance unto God,      in this day, doth not and shall never consist in contending or      disputing with any soul; nay rather, what is preferable in the      sight of God is that the cities of men's hearts, which are ruled      by the hosts of self and passion, should be subdued by the sword      of utterance, of wisdom and of understanding. Thus, whoso seeketh      to assist God must, before all else, conquer, with the sword of      inner meaning and explanation, the city of his own heart and guard      it from the remembrance of all save God, and only then set out to      subdue the cities of the hearts of others.        213 Such is the true meaning of rendering assistance unto God.      Sedition hath never been pleasing unto God, nor were the acts      committed in the past by certain foolish ones acceptable in His      sight. Know ye that to be killed in the path of His good pleasure      is better for you than to kill. The beloved of the Lord must, in      this day, behave in such wise amidst His servants that they may by      their very deeds and actions guide all men unto the paradise of      the All-Glorious.        214 By Him Who shineth above the Dayspring of Sanctity! The      friends of God have not, nor will they ever, set their hopes upon      the world and its ephemeral possessions. The one true God hath      ever regarded the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive      possession--and this too but as an expression of His all-surpassing      mercy, that haply mortal souls may be purged and sanctified from      all that pertaineth to the world of dust and gain admittance into      the realms of eternity. For otherwise that ideal King is, in      Himself and by Himself, sufficient unto Himself and independent of      all things. Neither doth the love of His creatures profit Him, nor      can their malice harm Him. All have issued forth from abodes of      dust, and unto dust shall they return, while the one true God,      alone and single, is established upon His Throne, a Throne which      is beyond the reaches of time and space, is sanctified above all      utterance or expression, intimation, description and definition,      and is exalted beyond all notion of abasement and glory. And none      knoweth this save Him and those with whom is the knowledge of the      Book. No God is there but Him, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.      215 It behoveth the benevolence of the Sovereign, however, to examine all  matters with the eye of justice and mercy, and not to content himself with  the baseless claims of certain individuals. We beseech God to graciously  assist the King to fulfil that which He pleaseth, and, verily, that which  He desireth should be the desire of all the worlds.    216 Later this Servant was summoned to Constantinople, whither We arrived  accompanied by a poor band of exiles. At no time thereafter did We seek to  meet with anyone, as We had no request to make and no aim in view but to  demonstrate unto all that this Servant had no mischief in mind and had  never associated with the sowers of sedition. By Him Who hath caused the  tongues of all beings to speak forth His praise! While certain  considerations rendered it difficult to make application to any quarter,  such steps were perforce taken to protect certain souls. My Lord, verily,  knoweth what is in Me, and He beareth witness unto the truth of what I  say.    217 A just king is the shadow of God on earth. All should seek shelter  under the shadow of his justice, and rest in the shade of his favour. This  is not a matter which is either specific or limited in its scope, that it  might be restricted to one or another person, inasmuch as the shadow  telleth of the One Who casteth it. God, glorified be His remembrance, hath  called Himself the Lord of the worlds, for He hath nurtured and still  nurtureth everyone. Glorified be, then, His grace that hath preceded all  created things, and His mercy that hath surpassed the worlds.    218 It is clear and evident that, whether this Cause be seen as right or  wrong by the people, those who are associated with its name have accepted  and embraced it as true, and have forsaken their all in their eagerness to  partake of the things of God. That they should evince such renunciation in  the path of the love of the All-Merciful is in itself a faithful witness  and an eloquent testimony to the truth of their convictions. Hath it ever  been witnessed that a man of sound judgement should sacrifice his life  without cause or reason? And if it be suggested that this people have  taken leave of their senses, this too is highly improbable, inasmuch as  such behaviour hath not been confined to merely a soul or two--nay, a vast  multitude of every class have drunk their fill of the living waters of  divine knowledge, and, intoxicated, have hastened with heart and soul to  the field of sacrifice in the way of the Beloved.    219 If these souls, who have renounced all else but God for His sake and  offered up their life and substance in His path, are to be accounted as  false, then by what proof and testimony can the truth of what others  assert be established in thy presence? The late Haji Siyyid  Muhammad(30)--may God exalt his station and immerse him in the ocean of His  forgiveness and mercy!--was one of the most learned divines of his age, and  one of the most devout and pious men of his time. So highly was he  regarded that his praise was on every tongue, and his righteousness and  piety were universally acknowledged. Yet, when hostilities broke out with  Russia,(31) he who himself had pronounced the decree of holy war, and who  with blazoned standard had left his native land to rally to the support of  his faith, abandoned, after the inconvenience of a brief encounter, all  the good that he had purposed, and returned whence he had come. Would that  the veil might be lifted, and that which hath ere now remained hidden from  the eyes of men be made manifest!    220 For more than twenty years this people have, day and night, been  subjected to the fury of the Sovereign's wrath, and have been scattered by  the tempestuous gales of his displeasure, each to a different land.
