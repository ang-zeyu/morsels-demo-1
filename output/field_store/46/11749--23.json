We find, on the contrary, much unkindness, much vaunting of  themselves, much selfish conceit, much seeking, not only of their own,  but of that which of right belonged to their neighbours. The champions  of ecclesiastical monopoly were easily provoked to anger, and to  thinking and speaking all manner of evil of those who differed from them  as to the distribution of the Clergy Reserves. Roman Catholicism they  contemplated with a certain amount of toleration, as the Roman Catholic  hierarchy yielded the Government an unwavering support in return for the  freedom and privileges which they enjoyed. But their toleration was not  broad enough to cover any other form of religious belief. Dissent, in  all its multiform phases, they looked upon with mingled abhorrence and  contempt--as a thing to be shunned and tabooed by all right-minded  persons. Dissenting ministers of religion were regarded as \"low  fellows,\" whom it was no sin to persecute, and, if possible, drive out  of the country. Comparatively few of the latter were permitted to  solemnize matrimony during the first forty years of the Province's  history. By the statute 38 George III., chapter 4, passed in 1798, the  privilege of doing so was accorded to ministers of \"The Church of  Scotland, or Lutherans or Calvinists;\" but it was hedged about with  cumbrous restrictions which must have been felt as humiliating and  unnecessary. No person was to be regarded as a minister under the Act  until he had appeared before the Justices of the Peace in Quarter  Sessions, and had produced satisfactory credentials of his ordination.  He was also compelled to take the oath of allegiance. Even after  complying with all formalities, his functions were restricted to cases  where one or both of the parties to be joined together belonged to his  own religious society. Ministers of other denominations, including those  of the Methodist body, which was the most numerous religious community  in the Province, were not allowed the privilege of solemnizing marriage  rites till the year 1831. The ignominous disqualification was removed  by the statute 11 George IV., chapter 36, which was passed in 1830, but  which did not receive the royal assent until the following year. A  similar measure had repeatedly been passed by the Assembly in former  sessions, but had as often been rejected by the Upper House. Before the  law was finally and equitably settled as above mentioned, several  ministers of religion had been tried and banished from the Province for  having ventured to solemnize matrimony without legal authority. It is  said that in one case where a minister was tried on a charge of this  kind, the accused protested against his sentence, alleging that the  Chief Justice, who presided at the trial, had himself sanctioned the  performance of the ceremony. The Chief Justice, being called upon to  descend from the judgment seat and give evidence as to this fact,  declined to do so; but he afterwards procured a pardon for the  prisoner.[50]    The Compact always contained within its ranks a few persons of more than  average ability. Some of them doubtless believed that the course pursued  by their organization was for the advantage of the colony, though,  reasoning by the light of present knowledge, it is difficult to  comprehend how men of even moderate perspicacity and judgment could have  brought themselves to such a conclusion. It was, however, inevitable  that persons of such narrow and contracted views--persons to whom self  and pelf were the mainsprings of life--should degenerate, mentally as  well as morally. The persons composing the second generation were, with  very few exceptions, striking illustrations of the doctrine of the  descent of man. Their sires had been men of energy and force of  character. They themselves were--to borrow a phrase from the acting  drama--the mere walking gentlemen of the colony. The sires had  originated a bold and determined policy, and had from first to last  pursued it with consistent vigour. The sons had neither brains to  conceive nor discretion to carry out the conceptions of others. The  sires had been persons whom it had been possible for the commonalty to  respect. The sons were persons whom it was impossible not to despise.  Surely a more superlatively commonplace and contemptible race of human  beings has seldom been seen on the earth than four-fifths of the second  generation of this bastard aristocracy of Upper Canada. It bore no  resemblance to any other aristocracy whereof history has preserved any  record. The old Roman commonalty, while they groaned beneath the iron  heel of tyranny, were one and all conscious of a secret pride in their  imperial oppressors. For the Roman aristocracy was an aristocracy of  nature. The Roman patricians made foreign rulers to crouch and tremble  at the name of Rome. Their triumphs were the triumphs of the nation.  Caius of Corioli, Furius Camillus, Titus Capitolinus, were names the  mere utterance of which stirred the Roman blood like the blast of a  trumpet. For many a long year after one haughty dictator had slept his  last sleep beneath the walls of Praeneste, and after another had taken  his final plunge beneath the yellow Tiber or from the Tarpeian rock,  their exploits furnished themes for tale and song around the Roman  camp-fires. These puissant representatives of the dominant class had  shown little sympathy for the plebeians, upon whom they had looked down  from a lofty height, and towards whom they had ever borne themselves  with haughtiness and disdain. But their pride was a something to be  tolerated by Romans of every degree, for they had achieved much glory  for the Roman name. In the words of one who has interpreted the  sentiment of those times with rare felicity, Rome could bear the pride  of him of whom herself was proud. The old French noblesse, again, were  not devoid of redeeming qualities. Their galling yoke would not have  been borne from reign to reign, and through century after century, even  by such seeming reconcilables as constituted the bulk of the French  populace during the ante-Revolutionary period, if they had all been like  the wicked St. Evremonde of Mr. Dickens's tragic story. As a class, they  had a subtle French grace about them which rendered their most grievous  exactions less hard to bear than were the exactions of their eastern  neighbours. They were an unmistakable _haute noblesse_, ever polished  and dignified. Some of them, like Philippe Egalite, had the cunning,  when the time of trial arrived, to bend to the popular storm, and even  to affect a zeal for citizenship. Comparatively few of them were at once  _blase_ and brainless. It may be doubted if a single one of them  combined--as did many of the rank and file of the second generation of  the Family Compact of Upper Canada--the pretensions of an aristocrat  with the sentiments of a boor and the intellectual development of a  child. Yet further. The feeling of veneration with which the English  commonalty have for centuries regarded the House of Lords is easy enough  to understand. That feeling seems to be rapidly passing away, if,  indeed, it has not already departed. But it would not have endured from  the time of the Plantagenets to the time of Queen Victoria if it had not  had some substantial foundation to rest upon. The House of Lords has  always contained a number of men of high integrity and ability. Take it  for all and all, it is probably the most just-minded and intellectual  aristocratic assembly the world has ever seen. This may not be very high  praise, but it may at least be taken for what it is worth. Its  individual members are seldom brought sufficiently near to the lower  order of the commonalty to enable the latter to detect their weaknesses.  Their wealth, prestige and social position give them a vast influence,  while at the same time their legislative powers are held in check by the  direct representatives of the people. Most of these conditions were  directly reversed in Upper Canada, where the members of the dominant  faction were brought into the closest relations with the people  generally, insomuch that their many deficiencies could not be concealed.  Such wealth as they had they were too often known to have obtained at  the expense of the rest of the community. The Lower House formed no  efficacious check upon them, for they either managed to return a  sufficient number of their tools to control the vote in that body, or  else they rendered the Assembly's operations of no avail by means of  their influence in the Legislative Council. They had none of the  graceful suavity of the Lower Canadian seigneurs. Nor could they boast  of the superiority derived from a liberal education. Many of them--even  including some of those who held high public offices--were so illiterate  that they were unable to write a simple business letter without  committing errors of orthography of which any one but Artemus Ward or  Jeames de la Pluche might well feel ashamed.    Nearly all the leading spirits of this strangely-assorted oligarchy were  either wealthy or on the direct road to wealth. Being comfortably  provided for at the public cost, in the form of fat offices or wild  lands, or both, they assumed a swelling port, and aped, as best they  knew how, the manners and customs of the upper classes in Great Britain.  They built their dwellings in imitation of old-fashioned English  manor-houses, with a variety of wings and gables, and with broad  entrance halls which in an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#18)"],[1,"or  crack in his character--no tinge of even the minor immoralities--no  fantastic humour carrying him sometimes off his feet--no preposterous  hobby--such a man, walking straight along the surface of this world in  the arc of a circle, is a very dangerous character, no doubt; of such  all children, dogs, simpletons, and other creatures that have the  instinct of the odious in their nature, feel an innate loathing. And  yet it is questionable if your perfectionised Sir Charles Grandison is  quite so dangerous a character as your \"miserable sinner,\" vociferously  conscious that he is the frailest of the frail, and that he can do no  good thing of himself. And indeed, in practice, the external symptoms of  these two characteristics have been known so to alternate in one  disposition as to render it evident that each is but the same moral  nature under a different external aspect,--the mask, cowl, varnish,  crust, or whatever you like to call it, having been adapted to the  external conditions of the man--that is, to the society he mixes in, the  set he belongs to, the habits of the age, and the way in which he  proposes to get on in life. It is when the occasion arises for the mask  being thrown aside, or when the internal passions burst like a volcano  through the crust, that terrible events take place, and the world throbs  with the excitement of some wonderful criminal trial.[24]    [Footnote 24: It has often been observed that it is among the Society of  Friends, who keep so tight a rein on the passions and propensities, that  these make the most terrible work when they break loose. De Quincey, in  one of his essays on his contemporaries, giving a sketch of a man of  great genius and high scholarship, whose life was early clouded by  insanity, gives some curious statements about the effects of the system  of rigid restraint exercised by the Society of Friends, which I am not  prepared either to support or contradict. After describing the system of  restraint itself, he says: \"This is known, but it is not equally known  that this unnatural restraint, falling into collision with two forces at  once--the force of passion and of youth--not unfrequently records its  own injurious tendencies, and publishes the rebellious movements of  nature by distinct and anomalous diseases. And, further, I have been  assured, upon most excellent authority, that these diseases--strange and  elaborate affections of the nervous system--are found _exclusively_  among the young men and women of the Quaker Society; that they are known  and understood exclusively amongst physicians who have practised in  great towns having a large Quaker population, such as Birmingham; that  they assume a new type and a more inveterate character in the second or  third generation, to whom this fatal inheritance is often transmitted;  and, finally, that if this class of nervous derangements does not  increase so much as to attract public attention, it is simply because  the community itself--the Quaker body--does not increase, but, on the  contrary, is rather on the wane.\"    There exist many good stories which have for their point the passions of  the natural man breaking forth, in members of this persuasion, in a  shape more droll than distressing. One of the best of these is a  north-country anecdote preserved by Francis Douglas in his Description  of the East Coast of Scotland. The hero was the first Quaker of that  Barclay family which produced the apologist and the pugilist. He was a  colonel in the great civil wars, and had seen wild work in his day; but  in his old age a change came over him, and, becoming a follower of  George Fox, he retired to spend his latter days on his ancestral estate  in Kincardineshire. Here it came to pass that a brother laird thought  the old Quaker could be easily done, and began to encroach upon his  marches. Barclay, a strong man, with the iron sinews of his race, and  their fierce spirit still burning in his eyes, strode up to the  encroacher, and, with a grim smile, spoke thus: \"Friend, thou knowest  that I have become a man of peace and have relinquished strife, and  therefore thou art endeavouring to take what is not thine own, but mine,  because thou believest that, having abjured the arm of the flesh, I  cannot hinder thee. And yet, as thy friend, I advise thee to desist; for  shouldst thou succeed in rousing the old Adam within me, perchance he  may prove too strong, not only for me, but for _thee_.\" There was no use  of attempting to answer such an argument.]    The present, however, is not an inquiry into the first principles either  of ethics or of physiology. The object of this rambling preamble is to  win from the reader a morsel of genial fellow-feeling towards the human  frailty which I propose to examine and lay bare before him, trusting  that he will treat it neither with the haughty disdain of the  immaculate, nor the grim charity of the \"miserable sinner:\" that he may  even, when sighing over it as a failing, yet kindly remember that, in  comparison with many others, it is a failing that leans to virtue's  side. It will not demand that breadth of charity which even rather rigid  fathers are permitted to exercise by the licence of the existing school  of French fiction.[25] Neither will it exact such extensive toleration  as that of the old Aberdeen laird's wife, who, when her sister  lairdesses were enriching the tea-table conversation with broad  descriptions of the abominable vices of their several spouses, said her  own \"was just a gueed, weel-tempered, couthy, queat, innocent, daedlin,  drucken body--wi' nae ill practices aboot him ava!\" But all things in  their own time and place. To understand the due weight and bearing of  this feeling of optimism, it is necessary to remember that its happy  owner had probably spent her youth in that golden age when it was deemed  churlish to bottle the claret, and each guest filled his stoup at the  fountain of the flowing hogshead; and if the darker days of dear claret  came upon her times, there was still to fall back upon the silver age of  smuggled usquebaugh, when the types of a really hospitable country-house  were an anker of whisky always on the spigot, a caldron ever on the  bubble with boiling water, and a cask of sugar with a spade in it,--all  for the manufacture of toddy.    [Footnote 25: In the renowned Dame aux Camelias, the respectable, rigid,  and rather indignant father, addresses his erring son thus: \"Que vous  ayez une maitresse, c'est fort bien; que vous la payiez comme un galant  homme doit payer l'amour d'une fille entretenue, c'est on ne peut mieux;  mais que vous oubliez les choses les plus saintes pour elle, que vous  permettiez que la bruit de votre vie scandaleuse arrive jusqu'au fond de  ma province, et jette l'ombre d'une tache sur le nom honorable que je  vous ai donne--voila ce qui ne peut etre, voila ce qui ne sera pas.\"    So even the French novelists draw the line \"somewhere,\" and in other  departments of morals they may be found drawing it closer than many good  uncharitable Christians among us would wish. In one very popular novel  the victim spends his wife's fortune at the gaming-table, leaves her to  starve, lives with another woman, and, having committed forgery, plots  with the Mephistopheles of the story to buy his own safety at the price  of his wife's honour. This might seem bad enough, but worse remains. It  is told in a smothered whisper, by the faithful domestic, to the  horrified family, that he has reason to suspect his master of having  indulged, once at least, if not oftener, in brandy-and-water!]    The habits of that age have passed away, and with them the drunken laird  and the widely tolerant wife. The advancing civilisation which has  nearly extinguished this class of frailties among those who have the  amplest means of indulgence in them, is, no doubt, doing for other  frailties, and will come at last to the one in hand, leaving it an  object of admiring and compassionate retrospect to an enlightened  posterity. There are people, however, too impatient to wait for such  results from the mellowing influence of progressive civilisation. Such a  consideration suggests to me that I may be treading on dangerous  ground--dangerous, I mean, to the frail but amiable class to whom my  exposition is devoted. Natural misgivings arise in one who professes to  call attention to a special type of human frailty, since the world is  full of people who will be prepared to deal with and cure it, provided  only that they are to have their own way with the disease and the  patient, and that they shall enjoy the simple privilege of locking him  up, dieting him, and taking possession of his worldly goods and  interests, as one who, by his irrational habits, or his outrages on the  laws of physiology, or the fitness of things, or some other neology, has  satisfactorily established his utter incapacity to take charge of his  own affairs. No! This is not a cruel age; the rack, the wheel, the boot,  the thumbikins, even the pillory and the stocks, have disappeared;  death-punishment is dwindling away; and if convicts have not their full  rations of cooked meat, or get damaged coffee or sour milk, or are  inadequately supplied with flannels and clean linen, there will be an  outcry and an inquiry, and a Secretary of State will lose a percentage  of his influence, and learn to look better after the administration of  patronage. But, at the same time, the area of punishment--or of  \"treatment,\" as it is mildly termed--becomes alarmingly widened, and  people require to look sharply into themselves lest they should be  tainted with any little frailty or peculiarity which may transfer them  from the class of free self-regulators to that of persons under  \"treatment.\" In Owen's parallelograms there were to be no prisons: he  admitted no power in one man to inflict punishment upon another for  merely obeying the dictates of"]]]
