(#18)"],[1,"r-whelming  and crushing evidence (scientific evidence, of course) that no event has  ever occurred on this earth which was not the effect of natural causes.  Hence there have been no miracles, and Christ is not risen.[44] He says  that the doctrine that belief in a personal God is necessary to any  religion worthy of the name, is a mere matter of opinion. Tyndall,  Carpenter, and Henry Thompson, teach that prayer is a superstitious  absurdity; Herbert Spencer, whom they call their \"great philosopher,\"  _i. e._, the man who does their thinking, labors to prove that there  cannot be a personal God, or human soul or self; that moral laws are  mere \"generalizations of utility,\" or, as Carl Vogt says, that self  respect, and not the will of God, is the ground and rule of moral  obligation. If any protest be made against such doctrines, we are told  that scientific truth cannot be put down by denunciation (or as Vogt  says, by barking). So doubtless the Pharisees, when our blessed Lord  called them hypocrites and a generation of vipers, and said: \"Ye compass  sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him  twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,\" doubtless thought that  that was a poor way to refute their theory, that holiness and salvation  were to be secured by church-membership and church-rites. Nevertheless,  as those words were the words of Christ, they were a thunderbolt which  reverberates through all time and space, and still makes Pharisees of  every name and nation tremble. Huxley's Irenicum will not do. Men who  are assiduously poisoning the fountains of religion, morality, and  social order, cannot be let alone.    Haeckel's Irenicum amounts to much the same as that of Professor Huxley.  He forbids the right to speak on these vital subjects, to all who are  not thoroughly versed in biology, and who are not entirely emancipated  from the trammels of their long cherished traditional beliefs.[45] This,  as the whole context shows, means that a man in order to be entitled to  be heard on the evolution theory, must be willing to renounce his faith  not only in the Bible, but in God, in the soul, in a future life, and  become a monistic materialist.[46]    It is very reasonable that scientific men, in common with lawyers and  physicians and other professional men, should feel themselves entitled  to be heard with special deference on subjects belonging to their  respective departments. This deference no one is disposed to deny to men  of science. But it is to be remembered that no department of human  knowledge is isolated. One runs into and overlaps another. We have  abundant evidence that the devotees of natural science are not willing  to confine themselves to the department of nature, in the common sense  of that word. They not only speculate, but dogmatize, on the highest  questions of philosophy, morality, and religion. And further, admitting  the special claims to deference on the part of scientific men, other men  have their rights. They have the right to judge of the consistency of  the assertions of men of science and of the logic of their reasoning.  They have the right to set off the testimony of one or more experts  against the testimony of others; and especially, they have the right to  reject all speculations, hypotheses, and theories, which come in  conflict with well established truths. It is ground of profound  gratitude to God that He has given to the human mind intuitions which  are infallible, laws of belief which men cannot disregard any more than  the laws of nature, and also convictions produced by the Spirit of God  which no sophistry of man can weaken. These are barriers which no man  can pass without plunging into the abyss of outer darkness.    If there be any truth in the preceding remarks, then it is obvious that  there can be no harmony between science and religion until the evils  referred to be removed. Scientific men must come to recognize  practically, and not merely in words, that there are other kinds of  evidence of truth than the testimony of the senses. They must come to  give due weight to the testimony of consciousness, and to the intuitions  of the reason and conscience. They must cease to require the deference  due to established facts to be paid to their speculations and  explanations. And they must treat their fellow-men with due respect. The  Pharisees said to the man whose sight had been restored by Christ, \"Thou  wast altogether born in sin, and dost thou teach us!\" Men of science  must not speak thus. They must not say to every objector, Thou art not  scientific, and therefore hast no right to speak. The true Irenicum is  for all parties to give due heed to such words as these, \"If any man  would be wise, let him become a fool, that he may be wise;\" or these,  \"Be converted, and become as little children;\" or these, \"The Spirit of  Truth shall guide you in all truth.\" We are willing to hear this called  cant. Nevertheless, these latter words fell from the lips of Him who  spake as never man spake.    So much, and it is very little, on the general question of the relation  of science to religion. But what is to be thought of the special  relation of Mr. Darwin's theory to the truths of natural and revealed  religion? We have already seen that Darwinism includes the three  elements, evolution, natural selection, and the denial of design in  nature. These points, however, cannot now be considered separately.    It is conceded that a man may be an evolutionist and yet not be an  atheist and may admit of design in nature. But we cannot see how the  theory of evolution can be reconciled with the declarations of the  Scriptures. Others may see it, and be able to reconcile their allegiance  to science with their allegiance to the Bible. Professor Huxley, as we  have seen, pronounces the thing impossible. As all error is antagonistic  to truth, if the evolution theory be false, it must be opposed to the  truths of religion so far as the two come into contact. Mr. Henslow,  indeed, says Science and Religion are not antagonistic because they are  in different spheres of thought. This is often said by men who do not  admit that there is any thought at all in religion; that it is merely a  matter of feeling. The fact, however, is that religion is a system of  knowledge, as well as a state of feeling. The truths on which all  religion is founded are drawn within the domain of science, the nature  of the first cause, its relation to the world, the nature of second  causes, the origin of life, anthropology, including the origin, nature,  and destiny of man. Religion has to fight for its life against a large  class of scientific men. All attempts to prevent her exercising her  right to be heard are unreasonable and vain.    It should be premised that this paper was written for the single purpose  of answering the question, What is Darwinism? The discussion of the  merits of the theory was not within the scope of the writer. What  follows, therefore, is to be considered only in the light of a practical  conclusion.    1. The first objection to the theory is its _prima facie_ incredibility.  That a single plant or animal should be developed from a mere cell, is  such a wonder, that nothing but daily observation of the fact could  induce any man to believe it. Let any one ask himself, suppose this  fact was not thus familiar, what amount of speculation, of arguments  from analogies, possibilities, and probabilities, could avail to produce  conviction of its truth. But who can believe that all the plants and  animals which have ever existed upon the face of the earth, have been  evolved from one such germ? This is Darwin's doctrine. We are aware that  this apparent impossibility is evaded by the believers in spontaneous  generation, who hold that such germ cells may be produced anywhere and  at all times. But this is not Darwinism. Darwin wants us to believe that  all living things, from the lowly violet to the giant redwoods of  California, from the microscopic animalcule to the Mastodon, the  Dinotherium,--monsters the very description of which fill us with  horror,--bats with wings twenty feet in breadth, flying dragons,  tortoises ten feet high and eighteen feet long, etc., etc., came one and  all from the same primordial germ. This demand is the more unreasonable  when we remember that these living creatures are not only so different,  but are, as to plants and animals, directly opposed in their functions.  The function of the plant, as biologists express it, is to produce  force, that of the animal to expend it. The plant, in virtue of a power  peculiar to itself, which no art or skill of man can imitate, transmutes  dead inorganic matter into organic matter, suited to the sustenance of  animal life, and without which animals cannot live. The gulf, therefore,  between the plant and animal would seem to be impassable.    Further, the variations by which the change of species is effected are  so trifling as often to be imperceptible, and their accumulation of them  so slow as to evade notice,--the time requisite to accomplish any marked  change must be counted by millions, or milliards of years. Here is  another demand on our credulity. The apex is reached when we are told  that all these transmutations are effected by chance, that is, without  purpose or intention. Taking all these things into consideration, we  think it may, with moderation, be said, that a more absolutely  incredible theory was never propounded for acceptance among men.    2. There is no pretence that the theory can be proved. Mr. Darwin does  not pretend to prove it. He admits that all the facts in the case can be  accounted for on the assumption of divine purpose and control. All that  he claims for his theory is that it is possible. His mode of arguing is  that if we suppose this and that, then it may have happened thus and so.

They are now  resorting to their old discredited methods in a new environment and thus  the poison of the Russian Black Hundreds is being spread in England,  Germany, France, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, and even in this  country. The voice is the voice of dead despotic Russia, and the hand is  the hand of the same \"Black Hundreds.\"    And now cowardly anonymous writers are embellishing the \"protocols,\"  adding new lies to the old ones, making accusations against the Jews  that even Nilus-Lutostansky-Butmi dared not make in darkest Russia.  Perhaps some day these new legends and absurd, malicious myths may  evolve into a new and revised edition of secret Jewish \"protocols.\"    In periods of turmoil and unrest such venomous fabrications may gain  credence among the ignorant and may poison their minds. But, like all  anti-semitic myths of old, the new anti-Jewish legends are bound to  destroy themselves. A lie shuns the sunlight. It thrives in darkness. It  cannot survive analysis. The truth will prevail.    Israel has no secret protocols, no hidden designs. After all its  tribulations, its dream is still of peace, of justice and of human  brotherhood. After all the centuries the word that came from Sinai and  the message of the prophets of old are still enshrined in its heart.  Indeed as has been aptly said: \"The Holy Scriptures are the only  authentic protocols of the Wise Men of Zion.\"    THE END          Books                                From  translated by    HERMAN BERNSTEIN    the Russian      =RESURRECTION. By Count Leo Tolstoi.= (Published 1900.) It depicts with  a master hand the ocean of life rocked by storm and lulled to sleep and  ease. In the splash of every wave is heard the story of human emotions,  misery, disenchantment, suffering, crime, and life, that is true--even in  art. Illustrated. Cloth bound. Price, $1.00; postpaid.      =\"FOMA GORDEYEV.\" By Maxim Gorky.= (Published 1901.) This book made  Gorky's literary reputation in Russia, Germany and France. It is a most  remarkable novel. The New York _Evening Post_ says:         \"Maxim Gorky, the young Russian poet of the vagabond and the       proletariat, the most ardent worshipper at the shrine of Nietzsche       and his ideal 'Over-Man,' owes much of his sudden popularity to his       personality. The son of a poor upholsterer, Gorky was thrown upon       his own resources at the age of nine and since then has experienced       a wide range of human emotions, struggles, depravity and misery.       Shoemaker, apple peddler, painter, dock-hand, railroad workman,       baker and tramp, this unique author had a thousand and one similar       occupations, and had even made more than one attempt to take his       own life.\"    This version of =Foma Gordeyev=, is in no way abridged, giving the exact  reproduction of the thought and expression of the author. Cloth bound.  Price, $1.00; postpaid.      =THE SEVEN WHO WERE HANGED. By Leonid Andreyev.= (Published 1909.) What  reviewers say:         \"It is by reason of its art even more real, more horrifying, more       impressive than any other Russian fiction translated in a long       time. Under the crystal simplicity of Andreyev's style each spirit       reveals itself, stripped of its bodily covering, in its inmost       truth.\"--=New York Times.=         \"Grewsome because it is fearfully real. But it is compelling for       the same reason.\"--=New York World.=         \"It is not a mere morbid probing into the abnormal and horrible. It       has its mission. It is a grim and terrible picture, and it is       painted with tremendous art--the art of a Dore.\"--=Chicago       Inter-Ocean.=    Cloth bound. Price, $1.00; postpaid.      =THE FORGED COUPON. By Count Leo Tolstoi.= (Published 1912.) This story  shows the successive evil and wrong resulting from the forging of a bank  note by a student in need of money. Numerous crimes succeed each other  as a result of this first wrong act, until the wave of crime is checked  by a poor, ignorant woman and a lame tailor, who follow the real  teaching of Christ. The book contains also =After the Ball=, a story of  love and military life; =Korney Vasilyev=, a story of peasant life;  =Tolstoi's Vital Humanitarian Ideas=, giving the very essence of the  fountain-spring and incentive of all the literary work ever written by  this wonderful man--a peep, as it were, at the power-works of his  thinking machine.
