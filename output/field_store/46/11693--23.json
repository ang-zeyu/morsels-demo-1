Going up to the  captain, I said:    \"Captain, I am Sindbad.\"    \"Surely,\" said he, \"I and the passengers saw Sindbad swallowed in the  waves many hundred miles away.\"    Some others, however, coming up, I was recognized; and the captain then  restored me the bales, with many congratulations. I made a valuable  present to King Mihrage, who bestowed a rich gift on me in return; and,  having made some advantageous purchases, I arrived at Balsora, where,  after I had sold my goods, I found myself possessed of a hundred  thousand sequins.      THE SECOND VOYAGE    [Illustration]    Becoming weary of a quiet life in Balsora, and having bought trading  goods, I again went to sea with some merchants. After touching at  several places, we landed at an uninhabited island. We amused ourselves  in different ways, but I, having taken my wine and provisions, sat down  and fell asleep. When I awoke, I found that my companions were gone, and  that the ship had sailed. I climbed to the top of a very high tree, and  perceived at a distance an object that was very large and white. I  descended to the ground, and ran toward this strange-looking object.  When I approached it I found it was about fifty paces in circumference,  quite round, and as smooth as ivory, but had no sort of opening. It was  now almost sunset, and suddenly the sky became darkened. I looked up and  beheld a bird of enormous size, moving like a prodigious cloud toward  me. I recollected that I had heard of a bird called the roc, so large  that it could carry away young elephants, and I therefore conjectured  that the large object I had been looking at was the egg of this bird.    As the bird approached I crept close to the egg, so that I had one of  the legs of this winged animal before me when it alighted. This limb  being as large as the trunk of a tree, I tied myself firmly to it with  my turban.    [Illustration]    The next morning the bird flew away, and carried me from this desert  island. I was borne so high that I could not see the earth, and then  carried downward so swiftly that I lost my senses. When I recovered, I  was on the ground. I quickly untied the cloth that bound me, and  scarcely was I free when the bird, having taken up a large serpent,  again flew away. I found myself in a deep valley, the sides of which  were too steep to be climbed. As I walked up and down in despair I  noticed that the valley was covered with diamonds of enormous size. But  I soon saw other objects of much less agreeable appearance. Immense  serpents were peeping out of holes on every side. When night came, I  took shelter in a cave, the entrance of which I guarded with the largest  stones I could find, but the hissing of the serpents entirely deprived  me of sleep. When day returned, the serpents retired to their holes; and  I came out of my cave, but with extreme fear. I walked heedless of the  serpents until I became weary, and then sat down and fell asleep. I was  awakened by something which fell near me. It was a large piece of fresh  meat, and presently I saw several other pieces.    I was now convinced that I must be in the famous valley of diamonds, and  that the pieces of meat were thrown in by merchants, who expected eagles  to pounce upon the flesh, to which diamonds were almost sure to  adhere. I hastened to pick up some of the largest diamonds I could find,  which I put into a little bag, and fastened it to my girdle. I then  selected the largest piece of flesh in the valley, which I tied to my  waist with the cloth of my turban, and then lay down upon my face to  wait for the eagles. Very soon one of the strongest pounced upon the  meat on my back, and flew with me to its nest on the top of the  mountain. The merchants began shouting to frighten the eagles, and when  they had forced the birds to quit their prey, one of them came to the  nest where I was. At first the man was frightened when he saw me there,  but after recovering himself, asked me how I got there. I told him and  the rest of the merchants my story. I then opened my bag, and they  declared that they had never seen diamonds of equal luster and size with  mine. The merchants having gathered their diamonds together, we left the  place the next morning, and crossed the mountains until we reached a  port. We there took ship and proceeded to the island of Roha. At that  place I exchanged some of my diamonds for other merchandise, and we went  on to Balsora. From Balsora I reached my native city, Bagdad, in which I  lived easily upon the vast riches I had won.    [Illustration]      THE THIRD VOYAGE    I soon resolved upon a third voyage, and once more took ship at Balsora.  After we had been at sea a few weeks, we were overtaken by a dreadful  storm, and were obliged to cast anchor near an island which the captain  had endeavored to avoid; for he assured us that it was inhabited by  pigmy savages, covered with hair, who would speedily attack us in great  numbers. Soon an innumerable multitude of frightful savages, about two  feet high, boarded the ship. Resistance was useless. They took down our  sails, cut our cable, towed the ship to land, and made us all go on  shore. We went towards the interior of the island and discovered a large  building. It was a lofty palace, having a gate of ebony, which we pushed  open, and soon discovered a room in which were human bones and roasting  spits. Presently there appeared a hideous black man, who was as tall as  a palm tree. He had but one eye, his teeth were long and sharp, and his  nails like the talons of a bird. He took me up as I would a kitten, but  finding I was little better than skin and bone, put me down with  contempt. The captain, being the fattest of the party, was sacrificed  to his appetite. When the monster had finished his meal he stretched  himself upon a great stone bench in the portico, and fell asleep,  snoring louder than thunder. In this manner he slept till morning. In  the morning he went out. I said to my companions:    \"Do not waste time in useless sorrow; let us hurry to look for timber  to make rafts.\"    [Illustration]    We found some timber on the seashore, and labored hard; but having no  tools, it was evening before we had finished; and while we were on the  point of pushing the raft off the beach, our hideous tyrant returned  and drove us to his palace, as if we had been a flock of sheep. We saw  another of our companions sacrificed, and the giant lay down to sleep as  before. Our desperate condition gave us courage; nine of us got up very  softly, and held the points of the roasting spits in the fire until we  made them red-hot; we then thrust them at once into the monster's eye.  He uttered a frightful scream, and having tried in vain to find us,  opened the ebony gate and left the palace. We did not stay long behind  him, but ran to the seashore, got our rafts ready, and waited for  daylight to embark. But at dawn we beheld our monstrous enemy, led by  two giants of equal size, and followed by many others. We jumped upon  our rafts, and pushed them from the shore, the tide helping us. The  giants seeing us likely to escape, tore great pieces of rock, and wading  in the water up to their waists, hurled them at us with all their might.  They sank every one of the rafts but that on which I was; thus all my  companions, except two, were drowned. We rowed as fast as we could, and  got out of the reach of these monsters. We were at sea two days, but at  last found a pleasant island. After eating some fruit, we lay down to  sleep, but were soon awakened by the hissing of an enormous serpent. One  of my comrades was instantly devoured by this terrific creature. I  climbed up a tree as fast as I could, and reached the topmost branches;  my remaining companion was following me, but the dreadful reptile  entwined itself round the tree and caught him. The serpent then went  down and glided away. I waited until late the next day before I ventured  to descend. Evening again approached, and I gathered together a great  quantity of small wood, brambles, and thorns. Having made them into  fagots, I formed a circle round the tree, and fastened the uppermost to  the branches of the tree. I then climbed up to the highest branches. At  night the serpent came again, but could not reach the tree; and crawling  vainly round and round my little fortification until daylight, he went  away. The next day I spied a ship in full sail a long way off. With the  linen of my turban I made a signal, which was perceived. I was taken on  board the ship and there told my adventures. The captain was very kind  to me. He said that he had some bales of goods which had belonged to a  merchant who had unintentionally left him some time ago on an  uninhabited island. As this man was undoubtedly dead, he intended to  sell the goods for the benefit of his relatives, and I should have the  profit of selling them. I now recollected this was the captain with whom  I sailed on my second voyage. I soon convinced him that I was really  Sindbad, whom he supposed to have been lost. He was delighted at the  discovery, and eagerly acknowledged that the property was mine. I  continued my voyage, sold my goods to great advantage, and returned  to Bagdad.      MY FOURTH VOYAGE    [Illustration]    My desire of seeing foreign countries rendered my pleasures at home  unsatisfactory. I therefore arranged my affairs, commenced a voyage to  Persia, and having bought a large stock of goods loaded a ship and again  embarked. The ship struck upon a rock, and the cargo was lost. A few  others and myself were borne by the current to an island, on which we  were surrounded by black savages, and carried to their huts. The savages  offered us herbs; my companions eagerly took them, for they were hungry.  Grief would not allow me to eat; and presently I saw that the herbs had  made my "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20750"],[0,"Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society - Vol. 3 (#18)"],[1,"to be without  any analogy in other mammals, or, at the least, a very obscure one, and  whose functions are wholly unknown.    Cetacea might with some propriety be divided into whales with whalebone,  and whales with teeth. Those with whalebone have rudimentary teeth in  both jaws in the foetal state. Fossil Cetacea exist, and they seem to  have been of both kinds, but, no doubt, were generically and  specifically distinct from the recent. Judging from the remains of those  I have seen, I am inclined to think that those with teeth were of a  stronger and firmer build in the skeleton than those called recent; that  the neck was longer, and the caudal portion of the column shorter than  in the recent kinds, and that they approached the Saurians in form.  There is a remarkable want of symmetry in the crania of some of the  Cetacea; but most remarkable is the cranium of the Narwhal. Of this fact  I have already spoken, in the article published in the Transactions of  the Royal Society of Edinburgh.    _Delphinus Phocaena. Dissection of a small Cetacean sent to me from  Orkney in the month of May 1835._--This species is said to abound on the  coasts, and to furnish a kind of fishery to the inhabitants. On  dissection we found 81 vertebrae, exclusive of the cephalic. The species  must be quite distinct from those previously and subsequently examined  by myself and many others, in which the number of vertebrae ranged from  61 to 66. It is also, I think, distinct from the specimen I saw in Dr.  R. Hunter's Museum in Glasgow, in which the number of vertebrae was 90,  exclusive of the cephalic in all the cases. Thus it stands with regard  to the Cetacea called Porpoises and Dolphins.    In certain species of _Delphinus_ the vertical column is composed of 61  vertebrae, in others of 65, in others of 66, in others of 81, in others  of 90.    The specimen I now describe was, no doubt, that of a young animal; and  the skeleton was prepared, consequently, as a natural one. This method  has the advantage of security against the loss of any important osseous  structures, which too frequently happens when the bones require to be  macerated. The bones contained little oil, and weighed, head included,  only 7-1/4 lbs.; the whole animal, when entire, weighed 14 stone, or 196  lbs.; the skeleton therefore was about a twenty-fourth part of the whole  weight. It was a female. The external nostrils terminated in a single  orifice of a semilunar shape, with the concavity turned towards the  snout. Measurements of young animals have not the importance of those of  the adult; but I give them here because I think that the specimen,  although young, had nearly attained its full growth:--                                                       ft.  in.    Total length over the dorsum                      6   5-2/8    Total length lateral surface                      6  11-2/8    Total length abdominal surface                    6  11-2/8    From the snout to the nostrils                    0  11-4/8    From the nostrils to the dorsal fin               1   6-4/8    Base of the dorsal fin                            0  11    From dorsal fin to foot of tail                   3   0-2/8    Breadth of pectoral limb                          0   4-4/8    From the snout to the organs of generation        3   9-4/8    Circumference anterior to the arm                 2   9    Circumference anterior to dorsal fin              3   2-4/8    Circumference posterior to dorsal fin             2  10    Circumference at setting on of the tail           0   8-4/8    Length of pectoral limb                           0  10    Breadth of tail                                   1   2    Greatest height of the dorsal fin                 0   9    From the notes taken at the time, I find that my brother remarks that  the Dolphin of Orkney differed a good deal in shape from those found in  the Forth and seas in the South of Scotland. There were, moreover, 16  more vertebrae than in the skeleton of the Common Porpoise of authors.  The teeth generally weighed 2-1/2 grains each.    Further, the muscles of the tongue, intrinsic as well as extrinsic, were  extremely well developed. The isthmus faucium was 3 inches long. All  this part was extremely glandular. A well-marked muscular gullet  followed, composed of two layers of muscular fibres,--one circular  internally, and one longitudinal externally. These latter sent a slip to  the base of the arytaenoid cartilages. The mucous membrane of the gullet  had no true epidermic covering, and in this respect differed remarkably  from the first gastric compartment, from which a cuticular lining could  be peeled off, as strong as that from the sole of the foot in man. The  larynx presented that organization so well described by the illustrious  Cuvier, and which I believe to be peculiar to the whales with teeth. It  differs very much, as I explained long ago, in its arrangement from that  of Whalebone Whales,--a fact of which I think Cuvier was not aware. The  cricoid cartilage was imperfect in form; the hyo-epiglottic muscles very  strong. The proper arytaenoid were present, and strong, but did not  extend so high as in man; the thyro-arytaenoid muscles were very fully  developed. In the interior of the larynx there were no projections nor  ventricles, no cuneiform cartilages, nor cornicula laryngis. The rings  of the trachea formed complete circles.    _Stomach._--The cuticular lining is limited to the first cavity or  compartment. It is in the second compartment that is found the curious  glandular arrangement first, I believe, described by me in the  'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.' This structure is most  probably not limited to the second compartment. There are four distinct  compartments in the stomach of this animal. A dilated duodenum follows,  6 inches in length. It is possible that this may have been in some  instances mistaken for a stomach. The valvulae conniventes commence with  the jejunum; these are longitudinal, and extend to within about 6 inches  of the anus, terminating at a point where the intestine seems enlarged.  The length of the intestines, large and small, was 90 feet;  circumference generally about 2 inches. Thousands and tens of thousands  of parasitical worms were found in the stomach, but none in the  intestine. In the stomach also we found four mandibles of the  cuttlefish, but no remains of anything in the intestines, and no  parasites.    _Heart and Vessels._--The heart weighed exactly one pound. The  Eustachian valve was small, that of Thebesius imperfect. The aorta  proceeded for about 3 inches of its course before giving off any  branches. At a point corresponding to the 15th or 16th lumbar vertebra  the vessel divided into the common iliacs. The _art. sacri media_, its  continuation, continued its course protected by the V-bones, and giving  off branches corresponding to the intervertebral spaces.    _Brain and Nervous System._--The erectile tissue surrounding the spinal  cord and origin of the spinal nerves in the Cetacea did not extend into  the interior of the cranium. The entire encephalic mass weighed 2-1/2  lbs.: cerebrum, 2 lbs.; cerebellum, 1/4; pons and medulla, 1/4 = 2-1/2.  Compared with a drawing of Camper of the _Delphinus Phocaena_, the brain  was found to differ remarkably, in being much broader in the line of the  middle and posterior lobes. In no animal did I ever find the fibrous  structure of the brain so well marked; and this extended to the  cerebellum[D]. I give here some measurements of the brain, which may be  of use to future observers. The brain is short from before backwards,  but broad transversely:--      Antero-posterior diameter                 5-2/8  inches.    Breadth                                   8      inches.    Greatest breadth of the cerebellum        4      inches.    Length of the cerebellar hemisphere       4-6/8  inches.    Depth of ditto                            3-2/8  inches.    Weight of the encephalic mass             2-1/2  lbs.    Depth of the interhemispherical fissure   1-2/8  inches.    Length of the corpus callosum             1-7/8  inches.    Weight of cerebrum                        2    }    Weight of cerebellum                      0-1/4}  = 2-1/2 lbs.    Weight of the pons and med. oblongata     0-1/4}    _Nerves._--The 7th pair was found to be unexpectedly large and firm,  including both portions. The anterior roots of the spinal nerves were  far more numerous than the posterior or dorsal.    _Muscles._--The panniculus carnosus, strong and fleshy, extended nearly  over the whole trunk. The recti abdominis were powerful, and attached  inferiorly in this way:--A portion runs to the pelvic bones; a much  stronger to a strong aponeurosis, situated between the anus and the root  of the tail.    The erector muscles of the spine (sacrolumbalis, longissimus dorsi and  multifidus spinae) weighed fully 16 lbs. They had but slender costal  attachments; but their spinal (small delicate tendons) were innumerable.  The scaleni were very large; and the vessels held the same relation to  them as in man. The serratus magnus was comparatively small. The larger  rhomboid had no spinal attachment; the minor rhomboid seemed to be the  larger of the two. The pectorals were comparatively small. The adipose  tissue appeared to be wholly confined to the subcutaneous region. The  muscles were of a deep brown colour, full of blood, with a short, dark,  and well-flavoured fibre: when cooked, they had a strong resemblance in  flavour and taste to the flesh of the hare.      Part II. THE BALAENA WHALES, OR WHALES WITH WHALEBONE.    In February 1834 a young whale of the family of Balaena Whales was caught  near the Queensferry, in the Firth of Forth. One much larger had been  seen some time before, but escaped. I purchased it for dissection,  although I was aware that it was impossible for me, during the hurry of  the winter session, to"]]]
