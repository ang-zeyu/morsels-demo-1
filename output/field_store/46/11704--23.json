Almagro had  released Hernando on his promise to return immediately to Spain.  This  promise Hernando broke.  Francisco made his brother commander of the  army, and the forces of the two commanders met on the plains of Salinas  on the 6th of April, 1538.    There were about seven hundred on one side, Pizarro's, and five hundred  on the other, equally divided between horse and foot, with a few pieces  of artillery in both armies.  The men of Chili, as Almagro's forces  were called, hated their former comrades, and Pizarro's men returned  this feeling with such animosities as are engendered nowhere save in  civil war.  Victory finally attended Hernando Pizarro.  He had fought  in the ranks like a common soldier, save that he had been at great  pains so to distinguish himself by his apparel that every one could  know him, so that all who sought him could find him.  Orgonez was slain  as he lay on the ground, wounded.  Such was the close, fierce fighting  that the killed alone numbered nearly {104} two hundred, besides a  proportionately greater number wounded.    Almagro had watched the battle from an adjacent hill.  He was old and  ill, broken down from excesses and dissipations.  Unable to sit a  horse, he had been carried thither on a litter.  The sight of his  routed army admonished him to try to escape.  With great pain and  difficulty he got upon a horse, but being pursued, the animal stumbled  and Almagro fell to the ground.  Some of Pizarro's men were about to  dispatch him when Hernando interfered.  He was taken prisoner to Cuzco  and held in captivity for a while.  Hernando had announced his  intention of sending him to Spain for trial, but a conspiracy to effect  his release, in which was our old friend De Candia, caused a change in  his purposes.  Almagro was tried on charges which were easily trumped  up, was found guilty, of course, and in spite of his protestations and  piteous appeals for life, he was strangled to death at night in his  prison on the 8th of July, 1538, in the sixty-fifth year of his life.  His head was then struck from his shoulders and both were exhibited in  the great square at Cuzco.  Vainglorious, ignorant, incompetent, yet  cheerful, generous, frank, kindly and open-hearted, and badly treated  by Pizarro and his brothers, he possibly deserved a better fate.    The Pizarro brothers affected to be overcome by the stern necessity  which compelled poor Almagro's execution.  As Francisco had done when  he had killed Atahualpa, these two put on mourning and insisted upon  being pall-bearers, and exhibited every outward manifestation of deep  and abiding grief.    Almagro left a son, Diego, by an Indian woman, to whom he had not been  married.  This young man {105} was under the guardianship of Pizarro at  Lima.  The sword of Damocles hung over his head for a while, but he was  spared eventually and, the rebellion of Almagro having been cut down,  the revolt of the Inca crushed, peace appeared once more to dwell in  the land.      VIII. The Mean End of the Great Conquistador    But fate had not finished with the Pizarros as yet.  Hernando was sent  back to Spain to explain the situation, and Gonzalo despatched to  Quito, of which province he was made governor.  He had instructions to  explore the country eastward to see if he could find another Peru.  He  made a marvelous march to the head-waters of the Amazon River, where he  was deserted by one of his commanders, Orellana, who built a  brigantine, sailed down the whole length of the Amazon, finally  reaching Europe, while Gonzalo and those few of his wretched followers  who survived the terrible hardships of that march, struggled back to  Quito.    Francisco, the Marquis, was thus left alone in Peru.  The position of  the men of Chili was precarious.  Although outwardly things were  peaceful, yet they felt that at any time Pizarro might institute war  against them.  They got the young Almagro away from him, and a score of  men under Juan de Rada, a stout-hearted veteran, mercenary soldier,  determined to put the Marquis to death and proclaim the young Almagro  as Lord and Dictator of Peru.    On Sunday afternoon, the 26th of June, 1541, De Rada and nineteen  desperate men of Chili, met at De Rada's house in Lima.  Pizarro had  received a number of warnings which he had neglected, confident {106}  in the security of his position, but the existence of the conspiracy  had been brought home to him with peculiar force that Sunday, and he  had remained in his palace at Lima surrounded by a number of gentlemen  devoted to his cause.  At vespers--which seems to have been a favorite  hour for nefarious deeds among the Spaniards--the assassins sallied  forth from the home of De Rada and started for the palace.    Such was the indifference in which the people held the squabbles  between the Pizarrists and the Almagrists, that it was casually  remarked by many of them, as the assassins proceeded through the  streets, that they were probably on their way to kill the governor.  The governor was at supper on the second floor of his palace.  There  was a sudden tumult in the square below.  The door was forced open and  the Almagrists, shouting \"Death to Pizarro!\" rushed for the stairs.  Most of the noble company with the old Marquis fled.  The great  conquistador at least had no thought of flight.  There remained with  him, however, two pages, his brother Martin de Alcantara, Francisco de  Chaves, one of the immortal thirteen of Gallo, and another cavalier,  named De Luna.    As they heard the clash of arms on the stairs and the shouting of the  assailants, the Marquis ordered De Chaves to close the door; then he  sprang to the wall, tore from it his corselet and endeavored to buckle  it on his person.  De Chaves unwisely attempted to parley, instead of  closing the door and barring it.  The assailants forced the entrance,  cut down De Chaves, and burst into the room.  Pizarro gave over the  attempt to fasten his breastplate, and seizing a sword and spear,  defended himself stoutly while pealing his war-cry: \"Santiago!\" through  the palace.  The two pages, {107} fighting valiantly, were soon cut  down.  De Alcantara and De Luna were also killed, and finally, Pizarro,  an old man over seventy years of age, stood alone before the murderers.    Such was the wonderful address of the sword play with which he defended  himself that the conspirators were at a loss how to take him, until De  Rada, ruthlessly seizing one of his comrades, pitilessly thrust him  upon Pizarro's sword-point, and, before the old man could withdraw the  weapon, cut him in the throat with his sword.  Instantly Pizarro was  struck by a dozen blades.  He fell back upon the floor, but he was not  yet dead, and with his own blood he marked a cross on the stones.  It  is alleged by some that he asked for a confessor, but that is hardly  likely, for as he bent his head to press his lips upon the cross, one  of the murderers, seizing a huge stone bowl, or earthen vessel, threw  it upon his head and killed him.  _Sic transit Pizarro_!    If he has been the subject of much severe censure, he has not lacked,  especially of late, zealous defenders.  I have endeavored to treat him  fairly in these sketches.  Considering him in comparison with his  contemporaries, Cortes surpassed him in ability, Hernando in executive  capacity, Almagro in generosity, Balboa in gallantry, and De Soto in  courtesy.  On the other hand, he was inferior to none of them in  bravery and resolution, and he made up for his lack of other qualities  by a terrible and unexampled persistency.  Nothing could swerve him  from his determination.  He had a faculty of rising to each successive  crisis which confronted him, wresting victory from the most adverse  circumstances in a way worthy of the highest admiration.  He was not so  cruel as Pedrarias, but he was {108} ruthless enough and his fame is  forever stained by atrocities and treacheries from which no personal or  public success can redeem it.  In passing judgment upon him, account  must be taken of the humble circumstances of his early life, his lack  of decent, healthy environment, his neglected youth, his total  ignorance of polite learning.  Take him all in all, in some things he  was better and in other things no worse than his day and generation.      IX. The Last of the Brethren    Hernando Pizarro was delayed on his voyage to Spain and some of  Almagro's partisans got the ear of the King before he arrived.  He was  charged with having permitted by his carelessness the Peruvian uprising  and having unlawfully taken the life of Almagro.  The story of his  desperate defense of Cusco was unavailing to mitigate the anger of the  King at the anarchy and confusion--and incidentally the diminution of  the royal revenue--which prevailed in Peru.  Hernando was thrown into  prison at Medina, and kept there for twenty-three long and weary years.    He had married his own niece, Francisca Pizarro, illegitimate daughter  of the Marquis Francisco, by a daughter of the great Inca, Huayna  Capac.  The woman was a half-sister of Atahualpa and Huascar.  By this  questionable means, the family of the Pizarros, with certain dignities,  restored for their Peruvian service, was perpetuated in Spain.  Hernando died at the age of one hundred and four.    De Rada, after the assassination of Francisco, assembled the ancient  partisans of Almagro.  They swore fealty to the young Almagro, and  immediately {109} took the field against a new governor sent out by  Charles V. to take charge of affairs in Peru.  This Vaca de Castro,  through his able lieutenants, Alvarado and Carvajal, defeated the  forces of Almagro on the bloody and desperately fought field of Chapus,  took the young man prisoner to Cuzco, and beheaded him forthwith.  He  met his death bravely, without beseeching or repining.  Before the fate  of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],[0,"The Daffodil Mystery (#18)"],[1,"pad of newspaper cuttings. In the main they were cuttings from colloquial  journals printed in Chinese characters, but there were one or two  paragraphs evidently cut from one of the English papers published in  Shanghai.    He thought at first that these were records of cases in which Ling Chu  had been engaged, and though he was surprised that the Chinaman should  have taken the trouble to collect these souvenirs--especially the English  cuttings--he did not think at first that there was any significance in  the act. He was looking for some clue--what he knew not--which would  enable him to explain to his own satisfaction the mystery of the filched  pistol.    He read the first of the European cuttings idly, but presently his eyes  opened wide.         \"There was a fracas at Ho Hans's tea-room last night, due apparently       to the too-persistent attentions paid by an English visitor to the       dancing girl, the little Narcissus, who is known to the English, or       such as frequent Ho Hans's rooms, as The Little Daffodil----\"    He gasped. The Little Daffodil! He let the cutting drop on his knee and  frowned in an effort of memory. He knew Shanghai well. He knew its  mysterious under-world and had more than a passing acquaintance with Ho  Hans's tea-rooms. Ho Hans's tea-room was, in fact, the mask which hid an  opium den that he had been instrumental in cleaning up just before he  departed from China. And he distinctly remembered the Little Daffodil. He  had had no dealings with her in the way of business, for when he had had  occasion to go into Ho Hans's tea-rooms, he was usually after bigger game  than the graceful little dancer.    It all came back to him in a flash. He had heard men at the club speaking  of the grace of the Little Daffodil and her dancing had enjoyed something  of a vogue amongst the young Britishers who were exiled in Shanghai.    The next cutting was also in English and ran:         \"A sad fatality occurred this morning, a young Chinese girl, O Ling,       the sister of Inspector Ling Chu, of the Native Police, being found       in a dying condition in the yard at the back of Ho Hans's tea-rooms.       The girl had been employed at the shop as a dancer, much against her       brother's wishes, and figured in a very unpleasant affair reported       in these columns last week. It is believed that the tragic act was       one of those 'save-face' suicides which are all too common amongst       native women.\"    Tarling whistled, a soft, long, understanding whistle.    The Little Daffodil! And the sister of Ling Chu! He knew something of the  Chinese, something of their uncanny patience, something of their  unforgiving nature. This dead man had put an insult not only upon the  little dancing girl, but upon the whole of her family. In China disgrace  to one is a disgrace to all and she, realising the shame that the  notoriety had brought upon her brother, had taken what to her, as a  Chinese girl, had been the only way out.    But what was the shame? Tarling searched through the native papers and  found several flowery accounts, not any two agreed save on one point,  that an Englishman, and a tourist, had made public love to the girl, no  very great injury from the standpoint of the Westerner, a Chinaman had  interfered and there had been a \"rough house.\"    Tarling read the cuttings through from beginning to end, then carefully  replaced them in the paper package and put them away in the little  lacquer box at the bottom of the trunk. As carefully he returned all the  clothes he had removed, relocked the lid and pushed it under the iron  bedstead. Swiftly he reviewed all the circumstances. Ling Chu had seen  Thornton Lyne and had planned his vengeance. To extract Tarling's  revolver was an easy matter--but why, if he had murdered Lyne, would  he have left the incriminating weapon behind? That was not like Ling  Chu--that was the act of a novice.    But how had he lured Thornton Lyne to the flat? And how did he know--a  thought struck him.    Three nights before the murder, Ling Chu, discussing the interview which  had taken place at Lyne's Stores, had very correctly diagnosed the  situation. Ling Chu knew that Thornton Lyne was in love with the girl and  desired her, and it would not be remarkable if he had utilised his  knowledge to his own ends.    But the telegram which was designed to bring Lyne to the flat was in  English and Ling Chu did not admit to a knowledge of that language. Here  again Tarling came to a dead end. Though he might trust the Chinaman with  his life, he was perfectly satisfied that this man would not reveal all  that he knew, and it was quite possible that Ling Chu spoke English as  well as he spoke his own native tongue and the four dialects of China.    \"I give it up,\" said Tarling, half to himself and half aloud.    He was undecided as to whether he should wait for his subordinate's  return from Scotland Yard and tax him with the crime, or whether he  should let matters slide for a day or two and carry out his intention to  visit Odette Rider. He took that decision, leaving a note for the  Chinaman, and a quarter of an hour later got out of his taxi at the  door of the West Somerset Hotel.    Odette Rider was in (that he knew) and waiting for him. She looked pale  and her eyes were tired, as though she had slept little on the previous  night, but she greeted him with that half smile of hers.    \"I've come to tell you that you are to be spared the ordeal of meeting  the third degree men of Scotland Yard,\" he said laughingly, and her eyes  spoke her relief.    \"Haven't you been out this beautiful morning?\" he asked innocently, and  this time she laughed aloud.    \"What a hypocrite you are, Mr. Tarling!\" she replied. \"You know very well  I haven't been out, and you know too that there are three Scotland Yard  men watching this hotel who would accompany me in any constitutional I  took.\"    \"How did you know that?\" he asked without denying the charge.    \"Because I've been out,\" she said naively and laughed again. \"You aren't  so clever as I thought you were,\" she rallied him. \"I quite expected  when I said I'd not been out, to hear you tell me just where I'd been,  how far I walked and just what I bought.\"    \"Some green sewing silk, six handkerchiefs, and a tooth-brush,\" said  Tarling promptly and the girl stared at him in comic dismay.    \"Why, of course, I ought to have known you better than that,\" she said.  \"Then you do have watchers?\"    \"Watchers and talkers,\" said Tarling gaily. \"I had a little interview  with the gentleman in the vestibule of the hotel and he supplied me with  quite a lot of information. Did he shadow you?\"    She shook her head.    \"I saw nobody,\" she confessed, \"though I looked most carefully. Now what  are you going to do with me, Mr. Tarling?\"    For answer, Tarling took from his pocket a flat oblong box. The girl  looked wonderingly as he opened the lid and drew forth a slip of  porcelain covered with a thin film of black ink and two white cards.  His hand shook as he placed them on the table and suddenly the girl  understood.    \"You want my finger prints?\" she asked and he nodded.    \"I just hate asking you,\" he said, \"but----\"    \"Show me how to do it,\" she interrupted and he guided her.    He felt disloyal--a very traitor, and perhaps she realised what he was  thinking, for she laughed as she wiped her stained finger tips.    \"Duty's duty,\" she mocked him, \"and now tell me this--are you going to  keep me under observation all the time?\"    \"For a little while,\" said Tarling gravely. \"In fact, until we get the  kind of information we want.\"    He put away the box into his pocket as she shook her head.    \"That means you're not going to tell us anything,\" said Tarling. \"I think  you are making a very great mistake, but really I am not depending upon  your saying a word. I depend entirely upon----\"    \"Upon what?\" she asked curiously as he hesitated.    \"Upon what others will tell me,\" said Tarling    \"Others? What others?\"    Her steady eyes met his.    \"There was once a famous politician who said 'Wait and see,'\" said  Tarling, \"advice which I am going to ask you to follow. Now, I will tell  you something, Miss Rider,\" he went on. \"To-morrow I am going to take  away your watchers, though I should advise you to remain at this hotel  for a while. It is obviously impossible for you to go back to your flat.\"    The girl shivered.    \"Don't talk about that,\" she said in a low voice. \"But is it necessary  that I should stay here?\"    \"There is an alternative,\" he said, speaking slowly, \"an alternative,\" he  said looking at her steadily, \"and it is that you should go to your  mother's place at Hertford.\"    She looked up quickly.    \"That is impossible,\" she said.    He was silent for a moment.    \"Why don't you make a confidant of me, Miss Rider?\" he said. \"I should  not abuse your trust. Why don't you tell me something about your father?\"    \"My father?\" she looked at him in amazement. \"My father, did you say?\"    He nodded.    \"But I have no father,\" said the girl.    \"Have you----\" he found a difficulty in framing his words and it seemed  to him that she must have guessed what was coming. \"Have you a lover?\"  he asked at length.    \"What do you mean?\" she countered, and there was a note of hauteur in her  voice.    \"I mean this,\" said Tarling steadily. \"What is Mr. Milburgh to you?\"    Her hand went up to her mouth and she looked at him in wide-eyed  distress, then:    \"Nothing!\" she said huskily. \"Nothing, nothing!\"          CHAPTER XVIII    THE FINGER PRINTS      Tarling, his hands thrust into his pockets, his chin dropped, his  shoulders bent, slowly walked the broad pavement of the Edgware Road on  his way from the girl's hotel to his flat. He dismissed with good reason  the not unimportant fact that he himself was suspect. He, a comparatively  unknown detective from Shanghai was by reason of his relationship to"]]]
