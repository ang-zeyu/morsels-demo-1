Considering that at the present moment our supreme duty is to repel the  German invasion at all costs, I think that this duty will be better  performed by putting the economic burden of the war upon the shoulders  of the well-to-do classes, for we have to reckon not only with the  taxpaying capacity of the mass of the people, but also with their  psychology.    I regard it as a great mistake that the important problem of the most  economical methods of spending money raised by taxation has not been  considered.    P. MASLOV.          THE WOMAN'S PART.    By MAZIE V. CARUTHERS.          Beside my ruined cottage, desolate,        The children cowering 'round me, mute from fright,      With tearless eyes and brooding heart, I wait,        Watching through all the long, the weary night.      God of the homeless, look from Heaven and see!      Out of the deeps, a woman calls on Thee!        My little ones, they cry all day for bread,        And, 'neath the shelter of my meagre breast,      Stirs one unborn, who must e'er long be fed--        Another babe to hunger with the rest.      Madonna Mary, hear a mother's moan!      Pity the travail I must bear alone!        The tasseled corn would plenteous harvest yield,        But all the crops are rotting in the sun.      Where are the reapers? On some battlefield        They fight for nought and die there, one by one!      God's comfort be upon them where they lie,      Sheep to war's shambles driven--who knows why?      Death and destruction walk by day, by night,        Men's blood is spilt and sacrificed in vain,      While women wait for tidings of the fight        Who may not even sepulchre their slain!      They say \"God's in His Heaven\"--but, instead,      'Twould seem He is asleep--or, maybe, dead!

What blooming  impudence!\"    \"Oh! you naughty bird to use such words!\" exclaimed Dot. But all the  Court murmured \"How clever!\" and the Cockatoo was pleased.    \"Native Cat, next!\" shouted the white Ibis. But at the first mention of  the Native Cat nearly every bird, and all the small game, prepared to  get away.    \"Why don't you call the Dingo at once?\" laughed the Kookooburra, who was  really keeping guard over Dot, although she did not know it. \"Humans  kill Dingoes.\"    \"The Dingo! the Dingo!\" every creature repeated in horror and  consternation; and they all looked about in fear, while the Kookooburra  chuckled to himself at all the stir his words had made.    \"It's quite true that animals and birds kill one another,\" said the  Magpie, who thought he ought to say something in Dot's defence, as that  was his part in the trial, \"therefore it is the same nature that makes  Humans kill us. If it is the nature of Humans to kill, the same as it is  the nature of birds and animals to kill, where is the sense and justice  of trying the prisoner for what she can't help doing?\"    \"Good!\" said the Welcome Swallow, \"argued like a lawyer.\"    At this unexpected turn of the trial the Judge softly whistled to  himself, \"Pop goes the weasel.\"    \"Don't talk to us about nature and justice and sense,\" replied the  Pelican, contemptuously. \"This is a Court of law, we have nothing to do  with any of them!\"    The Court all cheered at this reply, and the Magpie subsided in the  sulks.    \"Call the Kangaroo!\" cried the white Ibis.    \"It's no good,\" jeered the Kookooburra. \"Kangaroo and Dot are great  friends. She won't come if you called----\"    \"'Till all's blue!\" interrupted the Judge, and he went on with \"Pop goes  the weasel.\" This news caused a buzz of excitement. Everyone was  astounded that the Kangaroo, who had the heaviest grievances of all,  wouldn't appear against the prisoner.    \"Is it possible,\" said the Pelican, addressing the Kookooburra in slow  stern accents, \"Is it possible that the Kangaroo has forgiven all her  grievances?\"    \"All,\" said the Kookooburra.    \"The hunting?\" asked the Pelican.    \"Yes,\" answered the Kookooburra.    \"The rugs?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"The boots?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And,\" said the Pelican, still more solemnly and slowly, while all the  Court listened in breathless attention, \"and has she forgiven  _Kangaroo-tail soup_?\"    \"Yes! she's forgiven that too,\" answered the Kookooburra cheerfully.    \"Then,\" said the Pelican, hotly, \"I throw up the case,\" and he spread  his huge black wings, and flapped his way up into the sky and away.    \"What a go!\" said the Judge; and he might have said more, only Dot could  not hear anything on account of the racket and confusion. The trial had  failed, and every creature was making all the noise it could, and  preparing to hurry away. In the middle of the turmoil, Dot's Kangaroo  bounded into the open space, panting with excitement and delight.    \"Dot! Dot!\" she cried, \"I've found Willy Wagtail, and he knows your way!  Come along at once!\" And, putting Dot in her pouch, the Kangaroo leaped  clean over the Judge and carried her off!          CHAPTER XII      Although the Kangaroo was longing to hear the reason why so many Bush  creatures had collected round Dot whilst she was away, she was too  anxious to carry her to Willy Wagtail before nightfall to wait and  enquire what had happened. Dot, too, was so excited at hearing that her  way home had been found, that she could only think of the delight of  seeing her father and mother again. So the Kangaroo had hopped until she  was tired and needed rest, before they spoke. Then Dot described the  Trial, and made the Kangaroo laugh about the Cockatoo Judge, but she did  not say how it had all ended because the Kangaroo had forgiven Dot for  Humans making rugs of her fur, boots of her skin, and soup of her tail.  She was afraid of hurting her feelings by mentioning such delicate  subjects. The Kangaroo never noticed that anything was left out, because  she was bursting to relate her interview with Willy Wagtail.    She told Dot how she had found Willy Wagtail near his old haunt; how  that gossiping little bird had told all the news of the Gabblebabble  town and district in ten minutes, and how he had said he believed he  knew Dot by sight, and that if such were the case he would show Dot and  the Kangaroo the way to the little girl's home. Then Dot and the  Kangaroo hurried on their way again, the little girl sometimes running  and walking to rest the kind animal, and sometimes being carried in that  soft cosy pouch that had been her cradle and carriage for all those  days.    It was quite dusk by the time they arrived at a split-rail fence, and  heard a little bird singing, \"Sweet pretty creature! sweet pretty  creature!\"    \"That is Willy Wagtail making love,\" said the Kangaroo, with a humorous  twinkle in her quiet eyes. \"Peep round the bush,\" she said to Dot, \"and  you'll see them spooning.\"    [Illustration: THE KANGAROO CARRIES DOT OUT OF COURT]    Dot glanced through the branches, and saw two wagtails, who looked very  smart with their black coats and white waistcoats, sitting on two posts  of the fence a little way off. They were each pretending that their  long big tails were too heavy to balance them properly, and they seemed  to be always just saving themselves from toppling off their perch.  Occasionally Willy would dart into the air, to show what an expert in  flying he was; he would shoot straight upwards, turn a double somersault  backwards, and wing off in the direction one least expected. Afterwards  he would return to his post as calm and cool as if he had done nothing  surprising, and say \"Pretty pretty Chip-pi-ti-chip!\" that name meaning  the other wagtail. Then Chip-pi-ti-chip showed off _her_ flying, and  they both said to one another \"Sweet pretty creature!\"    At the sound of Dot and the Kangaroo's approach \"Chip-pi-ti-chip\" hid  herself in a tree, and Willy Wagtail, not knowing who was disturbing  them, scolded angrily; but when he saw the Kangaroo and the little girl,  he gave them the most cordial greeting, and wobbled about on a rail as  if he must tumble off every second.    \"This is Dot,\" said the Kangaroo a little anxiously, and rather  breathless with the speed she had made.    \"Just as I had expected!\" exclaimed Willy Wagtail, with a jerk of his  tail which nearly sent him headlong off the rail. \"I should know you  anywhere, little Human, though you do look a bit different. You want  preening,\" he added.    This last remark was in allusion to Dot's appearance, which certainly  was most untidy and dirty, for, beyond an occasional lick from the  Kangaroo, she had been five days without being tidied and cleaned.    \"I couldn't do it better,\" said the Kangaroo apologetically.    \"It doesn't matter at all,\" said Dot, putting her tangled curls back  from her eyes.    \"Well! I know where you live,\" gabbled off the Wagtail. \"It's the second  big paddock from here, if you follow the belt of the sheoak trees over  there. It's a house just like those things in Gabblebabble township.  There's a yellow sheep dog, who's very good tempered, and a black one  that made a snap at my tail the other day. There is an old grey cart  horse, an honest fellow, but rather dull; and a bay mare who is much  better company. There is a little red cow who is a great friend of mine,  and she had a calf a few days before you were lost. Dear me!\" exclaimed  the gossiping bird, \"what a fuss there has been these five days over  trying to find you! I've been over there every day to see the sight.  Such a lot of Humans! and such horses. I enjoyed myself immensely, and  made a lot of friends amongst the horses, but I didn't care so much for  the dogs; I thought them a nasty quarrelsome lot.    \"I went with the whole turnout to see the search. Goodness! the  distances they went, and the noise and the big fires they made, it _was_  exciting fun! They brought over some black Humans--'Trackers' is what  they are called, at least the Mounted Troopers' horses told me so (my  word! the Troopers' horses are jolly fellows!) Well, these black  trackers went in front of each party just like dogs, with their heads  to the ground, and they turned over every leaf and twig, and said if  a Human, a horse or a kangaroo had broken it or been that way. They  found your track fast enough, but one evening it came to an end quite  suddenly, and weren't they all surprised! I heard from a Trooper's  horse--(such a nice horse he was!)--that the trackers and white Humans  said it was just as if you had disappeared into the sky! There was just  a bit of your fur on a bush, and nothing anywhere else but a Kangaroo's  trail. No one could make it out.\"    \"That was when I took you in my pouch!\" exclaimed the Kangaroo.    \"Now,\" said the Wagtail, \"most of them have given up the search. Just  this evening Dot's father and a few other Humans came back, and the  yellow sheep dog told me the last big party is to start at noon  to-morrow, and after that there will be no more attempt to find Dot.  Only the sheep dog said he heard his master say he would go on hunting  alone, until he found her body. I haven't been over there to-day,\" wound  up the bird, \"they are all so miserable and tired, it gave me the blues  yesterday.\"    \"What are we to do? It is quite dark and late!\" asked the Kangaroo.    \"You had better stay here,\" counselled the Wagtail. \"One night more or  less doesn't matter, and I don't like leaving Chip-pi-ti-chip at  night-time. She likes me to sing to her all night, because she is  nervous. I will go with you to-morrow morning early, if you will wait  here until then.\"    \"Having found your lost way so far!\" said the Kangaroo to Dot, \"it would  be a pity to risk losing it again, so we had"]]]
