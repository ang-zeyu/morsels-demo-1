Earlier copies have--        The _antidote_ of death.    Philip Doddridge, D.D., was born in London, June 26, 1702. Educated at  Kingston Grammar School and Kibworth Academy, he became a scholar of  respectable attainments, and was ordained to the Non-conformist  ministry. He was pastor of the Congregational church at Northampton,  from 1729 until his death, acting meanwhile as principal of the  Theological School in that place. In 1749 he ceased to preach and went  to Lisbon for his health, but died there about two years later, of  consumption, Oct. 26, 1752.      _THE TUNE._    The hymn has been sometimes sung to \"Pisgah,\" an old revival piece by  J.C. Lowry (1820) once much heard in camp-meetings, but it is a  pedestrian tune with too many quavers, and a headlong tempo.    Bradbury's \"Jazer,\" in three-four time, is a melody with modulations,  though more sympathetic, but it is hard to divorce the hymn from its  long-time consort, old \"Arlington.\" It has the accent of its sincerity,  and the breath of its devotion.      \"LO, ON A NARROW NECK OF LAND.\"    This hymn of Charles Wesley is always designated now by the above line,  the first of the _second_ stanza as originally written. It is said to  have been composed at Land's End, in Cornwall, with the British Channel  and the broad Atlantic in view and surging on both sides around a  \"narrow neck of land.\"        Lo! on a narrow neck of land,      Twixt two unbounded seas, I stand,        Secure, insensible:      A point of time, a moment's space,      Removes me to that heavenly place,        Or shuts me up in hell.        O God, mine inmost soul convert,      And deeply on my thoughtful heart        Eternal things impress:      Give me to feel their solemn weight,      And tremble on the brink of fate,        And wake to righteousness.    The preachers and poets of the great spiritual movement of the  eighteenth century in England abated nothing in the candor of their  words. The terrible earnestness of conviction tipped their tongues and  pens with fire.      _THE TUNE._    Lady Huntingdon would have lent \"Meribah\" gladly to this hymn, but Mason  was not yet born. Many times it has been borrowed for Wesley's words  since it came to its own, and the spirit of the pious Countess has  doubtless approved the loan. It is rich enough to furnish forth her own  lyric and more than one other of like matter and metre.    The muscular music of \"Ganges\" has sometimes carried the hymn, and there  are those who think its thunder is not a whit more Hebraic than the  words require.      \"COME YE SINNERS POOR AND NEEDY.\"    Few hymns have been more frequently sung in prayer-meetings and  religious assemblies during the last hundred and fifty years. Its  author, Joseph Hart, spoke what he knew and testified what he felt. Born  in London, 1712, and liberally educated, he was in his young manhood  very religious, but he went so far astray as to indulge in evil  practices, and even published writings, both original and translated,  against Christianity and religion of any kind. But he could not drink at  the Dead Sea and live. The apples of Sodom sickened him. Conscience  asserted itself, and the pangs of remorse nearly drove him to despair  till he turned back to the source he had forsaken. He alludes to this  experience in the lines--        Let not conscience make you linger,        Nor of fitness fondly dream;      All the fitness He requireth        Is to feel your need of Him.    During Passion Week, 1767, he had an amazing view of the sufferings of  Christ, under the stress of which his heart was changed. In the joy of  this experience he wrote--        Come ye sinners poor and needy,    --and--        Come all ye chosen saints of God.    Probably no two hymn-lines have been oftener repeated than--        If you tarry till you're better        You will never come at all.    The complete form of the original stanzas is:        Come ye sinners poor and needy,        Weak and wounded, sick and sore;      Jesus ready stands to save you,        Full of pity, love and power.            He is able,        He is willing; doubt no more.    The whole hymn--ten stanzas--is not sung now as one, but two, the second  division beginning with the line--        Come ye weary, heavy laden.    Rev. Joseph Hart became minister of Jewin St. Congregational Chapel,  London, about 1760, where he labored till his death, May 24, 1768.      _THE TUNE._    A revival song by Jeremiah Ingalls (1764-1828), written about 1804, with  an easy, popular swing and a _sforzando_ chorus--        Turn to the Lord and seek salvation,    --monopolized this hymn for a good many years. The tunes commonly  assigned to it have since been \"Greenville\" and Von Weber's \"Wilmot,\" in  which last it is now more generally sung--dropping the echo lines at the  end of each stanza.    Carl Maria Von Weber, son of a roving musician, was born in Eutin,  Germany, 1786. He developed no remarkable genius till he was about  twenty years old, though being a fine vocalist, his singing brought him  popularity and gain; but in 1806 he nearly lost his voice by accidently  drinking nitric acid. He was for several years private secretary to Duke  Ludwig at Stuttgart, and in 1813 Chapel-Master at Prague, from which  place he went to Dresden in 1817 as Musik-Director.    Von Weber's Korner songs won the hearts of all Germany; and his immortal  \"Der Freischutz\" (the Free Archer), and numerous tender melodies like  the airs to \"John Anderson, my Jo\" and \"O Poortith Cauld\" have gone to  all civilized nations. No other composer had such feeling for beauty of  sound.    This beloved musician was physically frail and delicate, and died of  untimely decline, during a visit to London in 1826.      \"O HAPPY SAINTS WHO DWELL IN LIGHT.\"    Sometimes printed \"O happy _souls_.\" This poetical and flowing hymn  seems to have been forgotten in the making up of most modern church  hymnals. Hymns on heaven and heavenly joys abound in embarrassing  numbers, but it is difficult to understand why this beautiful lyric  should be _universally_ neglected. It was written probably about 1760,  by Rev. John Berridge, from the text, \"Blessed are the dead who die in  the Lord,\"    The first line of the second stanza--        Released from sorrow, toil and strife,    --has been tinkered in some of the older hymn-books, where it is found  to read--,        Released from sorrows toil and _grief_,    --not only committing a tautology, but destroying the perfect rhyme with  \"life\" in the next line. The whole hymn, too, has been much altered by  substituted words and shifted lines, though not generally to the serious  detriment of its meaning and music.    The Rev. John Berridge--friend of the Wesleys, Whitefield, and Lady  Huntingdon--was an eccentric but very worthy and spiritual minister,  born the son of a farmer, in Kingston, Nottinghamshire, Eng., Mar. 1,  1716. He studied at Cambridge, and was ordained curate of Stapleford and  subsequently located as vicar of Everton, 1775. He died Jan. 22, 1793.  He loved to preach, and he was determined that his tombstone should  preach after his voice was still. His epitaph, composed by himself, is  both a testimony and a memoir:       \"Here lie the earthly remains of John Berridge, late vicar of      Everton, and an itinerant servant of Jesus Christ, who loved his      Master and His work, and after running His errands many years, was      called up to wait on Him above.       \"Reader, art thou born again?       \"No salvation without the new birth.       \"I was born in sin, February, 1716.       \"Remained ignorant of my fallen state till 1730.       \"Lived proudly on faith and works for salvation till 1751.       \"Admitted to Everton vicarage, 1755.       \"Fled to Jesus alone for refuge, 1756.       \"Fell asleep in Jesus Christ,--\" (1793.)      _THE TUNE._    The once popular score that easily made the hymn a favorite, was  \"Salem,\" in the old _Psalmodist_. It still appears in some note-books,  though the name of its composer is uncertain. Its notes (in 6-8 time)  succeed each other in syllabic modulations that give a soft dactylic  accent to the measure and a wavy current to the lines:        O happy saints that dwell in light,      And walk with Jesus clothed in white,      Safe landed on that peaceful shore,      Where pilgrims meet to part no more:        Released from sorrow, toil and strife,      Death was the gate to endless life,      And now they range the heavenly plains      And sing His love in melting strains.    Another version reads:        ----and welcome to an endless life,      Their souls have now begun to prove      The height and depth of Jesus' love.      \"THOU DEAR REDEEMER, DYING LAMB.\"    The author, John Cennick, like Joseph Hart, was led to Christ after a  reckless boyhood and youth, by the work of the Divine Spirit in his  soul, independent of any direct outward influence. Sickened of his  cards, novels, and playhouse pleasures, he had begun a sort of  mechanical reform, when one day, walking in the streets of London, he  suddenly seemed to hear the text spoken \"I am thy salvation!\" His  consecration began at that moment.    He studied for the ministry, and became a preacher, first under  direction of the Wesleys, then under Whitefield, but afterwards joined  the Moravians, or \"Brethren.\" He was born at Reading, Derbyshire, Eng.,  Dec. 12, 1718, and died in London, July 4, 1755.      _THE TUNE._    The word \"Rhine\" (in some collections--in others \"Emmons\") names a  revival tune once so linked with this hymn and so well known that few  religious people now past middle life could enjoy singing it to any  other. With a compass one note beyond an octave and a third, it utters  every line with a clear, bold gladness sure to infect a meeting with its  own spiritual fervor.

Come now!\" said Rodolphe.    \"But what means--\"    \"But I assure you--\"    \"Oh, what can be this mystery?\" sang the two in chorus to the final air  of \"The White Lady.\"    Baptiste, who loved music, came running in at once. Marcel showed him  the paper.    \"Ah, yes,\" said Baptiste carelessly, \"I forgot to tell you. The landlord  came this morning while you were out. I paid him, to save him the  trouble of coming back.\"    \"Where did you find the money?\"    \"I took it out of the open drawer. I thought, sir, you had left it open  on purpose, and forgot to tell me to pay him, so I did just as if you  had told me.\"    \"Baptiste!\" said Marcel, in a white heat, \"you have gone beyond your  orders. From this day you cease to form part of our household. Take off  your livery!\"    Baptiste took off the glazed leather cap which composed his livery, and  handed it to Marcel.    \"Very well,\" said the latter, \"now you may go.\"    \"And my wages?\"    \"Wages? You scamp! You have had fourteen francs in a little more than a  week. What do you do with so much money? Do you keep a dancer?\"    \"A rope dancer?\" suggested Rodolphe.    \"Then I am to be left,\" said the unhappy domestic, \"without a covering  for my head!\"    \"Take your livery,\" said Marcel, moved in spite of himself, and he  restored the cap to Baptiste.    \"Yet it is that wretch who has wrecked our fortunes,\" said Rodolphe,  seeing poor Baptiste go out. \"Where shall we dine today?\"    \"We shall know tomorrow,\" replied Marcel.          CHAPTER VIII    THE COST OF A FIVE FRANC PIECE      One Saturday evening, at a time when he had not yet gone into  housekeeping with Mademoiselle Mimi, who will shortly make her  appearance, Rodolphe made the acquaintance at the table d'hote he  frequented of a ladies' wardrobe keeper, named Mademoiselle Laure.  Having learned that he was editor of \"The Scarf of Iris\" and of \"The  Beaver,\" two fashion papers, the milliner, in hope of getting her goods  puffed, commenced a series of significant provocations. To these  provocations Rodolphe replied by a pyrotechnical display of madrigals,  sufficient to make Benserade, Voiture, and all other dealers in the  fireworks of gallantry jealous; and at the end of the dinner,  Mademoiselle Laure, having learned that he was a poet, gave him clearly  to understand that she was not indisposed to accept him as her Petrarch.  She even, without circumlocution, made an appointment with him for the  next day.    \"By Jove,\" said Rodolphe to himself, as he saw Mademoiselle Laure home,  \"this is certainly a very amiable young person. She seems to me to have  a good grammar and a tolerably extensive wardrobe. I am quite disposed  to make her happy.\"    On reaching the door of her house, Mademoiselle Laure relinquished  Rodolphe's arm, thanking him for the trouble he had taken in  accompanying her to such a remote locality.    \"Oh! madame,\" replied Rodolphe, bowing to the ground, \"I should like you  to have lived at Moscow or the islands of the Sound, in order to have  had the pleasure of being your escort the longer.\"    \"That would be rather far,\" said Laure, affectedly.    \"We could have gone by way of the Boulevards, madame,\" said Rodolphe.  \"Allow me to kiss you hand in the shape of your cheek,\" he added,  kissing his companion on the lips before Laure could make any  resistance.    \"Oh sir!\" she exclaimed, \"you go too fast.\"    \"It is to reach my destination sooner,\" said Rodolphe. \"In love, the  first stages should be ridden at a gallop.\"    \"What a funny fellow,\" though the milliner, as she entered her dwelling.    \"A pretty girl,\" said Rodolphe, as he walked away.    Returning home, he went to bed at once, and had the most delightful  dreams. He saw himself at balls, theaters, and public promenades with  Mademoiselle Laure on his arm, clad in dresses more magnificent than  those of the girl with the ass's skin of the fairy tale.    The next morning at eleven o'clock, according to habit, Rodolphe got up.  His first thought was for Mademoiselle Laure.    \"She is a very well mannered woman,\" he murmured, \"I feel sure that she  was brought up at Saint Denis. I shall at length realize the happiness  of having a mistress who is not pitted with the small-pox. Decidedly I  will make sacrifices for her. I will go and draw my screw at 'The Scarf  of Iris.' I will buy some gloves, and I will take Laure to dinner at a  restaurant where table napkins are in use. My coat is not up to much,\"  said he as he dressed himself, \"but, bah! black is good wear.\"    And he went out to go to the office of \"The Scarf of Iris.\"    Crossing the street he came across an omnibus, on the side of which was  pasted a bill, with the words, \"Display of Fountains at Versailles,  today, Sunday.\"    A thunderbolt falling at Rodolphe's feet would not have produced a  deeper impression upon him than the sight of this bill.    \"Today, Sunday! I had forgotten it,\" he exclaimed. \"I shall not be able  to get any money. Today, Sunday!!! All the spare coin in Paris is on its  way to Versailles.\"    However, impelled by one of those fabulous hopes to which a man always  clings, Rodolphe hurried to the office of the paper, reckoning that some  happy chance might have taken the cashier there.    Monsieur Boniface had, indeed, looked in for a moment, but had left at  once.    \"For Versailles,\" said the office messenger to Rodolphe.    \"Come,\" said Rodolphe, \"it is all over!... But let me see,\" he thought,  \"my appointment is for this evening. It is noon, so I have five hours to  find five francs in--twenty sous an hour, like the horses in the Bois du  Boulogne. Forward.\"    As he found himself in a neighborhood where the journalist, whom he  styled the influential critic, resided, Rodolphe thought of having a try  at him.    \"I am sure to find him in,\" said he, as he ascended the stairs, \"it is  the day he writes his criticism--there is no fear of his being out. I  will borrow five francs of him.\"    \"Hallo! it's you, is it?\" said the journalist, on seeing Rodolphe. \"You  come at the right moment. I have a slight service to ask of you.\"    \"How lucky it falls out,\" thought the editor of \"The Scarf of Iris.\"    \"Were you at the Odeon Theater last night?\"    \"I am always at the Odeon.\"    \"You have seen the new piece, then?\"    \"Who else would have seen it? I am the Odeon audience.\"    \"That is true,\" said the critic, \"you are one of the caryatides of the  theater. It is even rumored that it is you who finds the money for its  subvention. Well, that is what I want of you, a summary of the plot of  the new piece.\"    \"That is easy, I have the memory of a creditor.\"    \"Whom is this piece by?\" asked the critic of Rodolphe, whilst the latter  was writing.    \"A gentleman.\"    \"It cannot be up to much.\"    \"Well, it is not as strong as a Turk.\"    \"Then it cannot be very robust. The Turks, you see, have usurped a  reputation for strength. Besides, there are no longer any Turks except  at masked balls and in the Champs-Elysees where they sell dates. One of  my friends knows the East and he assures me that all the natives of it  were born in the Rue Coquenard.\"    \"That is smart,\" said Rodolphe.    \"You think so?\" observed the critic, \"I will put it in my article.\"    \"Here is my analysis of the piece, it is to the point,\" resumed  Rodolphe.    \"Yes, but it is short.\"    \"By putting in dashes and developing your critical opinion it will fill  some space.\"    \"I have scarcely time, my dear fellow, and then my critical opinion will  not fill enough space either.\"    \"You can stick in an adjective at every third word.\"    \"Cannot you tail on to your analysis a little, or rather a long  criticism of the piece, eh?\" asked the critic.    \"Humph,\" said Rodolphe. \"I have certainly some opinions upon tragedy,  but I have printed them three times in 'The Beaver' and 'The Scarf of  Iris.'\"    \"No matter, how many lines do your opinions fill?\"    \"Forty lines.\"    \"The deuce, you have strong opinions. Well, lend me your forty lines.\"    \"Good,\" thought Rodolphe, \"if I turn out twenty francs' worth of copy  for him he cannot refuse me five. I must warn you,\" said he to the  critic, \"that my opinions are not quite novel. They are rather worn at  the elbows. Before printing them I yelled them in every cafe in Paris,  there is not a waiter who does not know them by heart.\"    \"What does that matter to me? You surely do not know me. Is there  anything new in the world except virtue?\"    \"Here you are,\" said Rodolphe, as he finished.    \"Thunder and tempests, there is still nearly a column wanting. How is  this chasm to be filled?\" exclaimed the critic. \"Since you are here  supply me with some paradoxes.\"    \"I have not any about me,\" said Rodolphe, \"though I can lend you some.  Only they are not mine, I bought them for half a franc from one of my  friends who was in distress. They have seen very little use as yet.\"    \"Very good,\" said the critic.    \"Ah!\" said Rodolphe to himself, setting to write again. \"I shall  certainly ask him for ten francs, just now paradoxes are as dear as  partridges.\" And he wrote some thirty lines containing nonsense about  pianos, goldfish and Rhine wine, which was called toilet wine just as  we speak of toilet vinegar.    \"It is very good,\" said"]]]
