Habit of observation and desire of knowledge were the prominent attributes  of his childish character; nevertheless he was ardent in all the sports of  boyhood. To the last he maintained a regard for his honor, which induced  him while yet a lad, and under promise not to divulge the name of a  schoolmate offender, to receive a severe flogging rather than to yield up  his knowledge upon the subject. At the age of sixteen, in the midst of a  Freshman term at Harvard College, he thought of matriculation; but upon  inquiry learned that he must not only be examined upon the works of  ordinary preparatory reading, but that it was necessary for him to expect  a call upon the volumes which his class had dispatched during the past  half year. At first he was daunted, but remembering there yet remained six  weeks of vacation, he addressed himself to the necessary labor--the  severity of which is best evidenced by the fact that in the short time  above mentioned he read Sallust, the odes of Horace, two books of Livy,  three books of the Anabasis, two books of the Iliad, and certain English  treatises. This sounds like the railroad instruction now much in vogue;  but its effects were permanent in value upon his mind. Few readers of his  works will accuse him of a want of proficiency in Latin! But the _often_  reading--the _saepe legendo_ was ever his habit: for he remembered the  couplet:      Gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed saepe cadendo    Sic homo fit doctus non vi sed saepe legendo.    He passed muster with the college tutors in January, 1795. Among his  classmates were the (afterwards Reverends) Dr. Tuckerman and Wm. E.  Channing--to the genius and character of the latter of whom he always bore  the most enthusiastic and hearty testimony. Indeed he contested with  Channing for the highest honor. Channing won it, but always gave the honor  himself to Story; while the latter always declared that the former won the  just meed of his genius and scholarship.    Their graduation was in the summer of 1798: and immediately upon quitting  college Mr. Story commenced the study of the law with Mr. Samuel Sewall,  afterwards Chief Justice in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. Fourteen  hours a day was over his quantum of study. Although sometimes  disheartened, he never surrendered his determination to master the  elements and details of his new profession.    _Studying_ law in those days was a far different thing from its _reading_  now. Then it was _multum_: now it is _multa_. No copious indexes and  multifarious treatises were counted by thousands: no digests (directories  to the streets, the avenues, the fountains and the temples of the  science), abounded by scores. Libraries were carried about in wheelbarrows  and not in processions of vans, when the inexorable moving day came  around. Learned judges were not then compelled to hold courts in remote  villages (resorting hereby to a _coup de loi_), in order to escape the  _cacoethes loquendi_ of case lawyers and presuming juniors. Legal lore was  builded up like the massive stone and hard grained mortar of the edifices  of that olden time--slowly, carefully, but lastingly; not as are builded  now the brick and stuccoed mansions of the snob and parvenu. Not that  abounding treatises and familiarizing digests forbid the idea of the  perfect lawyer now-a-days: only that to-day the law student in the midst  of a large library stands more in need (when thinking of the _otium_ which  accompanies certain dignity), to utter the ejaculation, \"lead us not into  temptation\"--the temptation of possessing that knowledge which teaches  where to seek for information, and not the kind which is information of  itself.    In 1801 Mr. Story came to the Salem bar while at the age of twenty-two.  After being three years at practice he married his first wife, who died  within two years afterward, plunging him into the deepest grief. During  his courtship he dabbled (as almost every young lawyer does until he finds  that clients are severe critics) in poetry, and wrote a didactic poem of  two parts in heroic verse, entitled \"The Power of Solitude.\" Adopting the  criticism of the biographers--its prominent defects were exaggeration of  feeling, confusion of imagery, want of simplicity of expression, stilted  and artificial style. But though dull as a poem, it shows facility and  talent for versification, breathes a warm aspiration for virtue and truth,  and is creditable to the scholarship of its author.    After the loss of his wife he sought relief from painful thoughts in the  laborious duties of a large and increasing business. His position at the  bar was prominent, and he was engaged in nearly all the cases of  importance. His manner to the jury was earnest and spirited; he managed  his causes with tact (that great acquirement of the successful lawyer:  being, as a distinguished barrister now dead and gone said to Dr. Hosack,  the same sheet anchor to the advocate which mercury or bark is to the  physician), was ready in attack or defence, and possessed great eloquence  of expression. As an advocate he showed a sagacity of perception which no  intricacy of detail could blind, no suddenness of attack confuse, and  which afterwards so distinguished him as a Judge. He was thrown among the  leading lawyers; and undaunted as all young lawyers should be (although  preserving their modesty of deportment and learning), he measured swords  with the most accomplished. Although sometimes vanquished, he always  received honors from even the victors.    It is a prevailing opinion with the junior members of the legal  profession, that their seniors delight in snubbing them; that they are  fond of being discourteous, and arrogant; that they are envious of some  and insulting to others. But it is rare indeed that the seniors err on  other ground in this respect than magnanimity. The industrious youngster,  the self-reliant youngster, the firm but respectful youngster, the versed  in elementary principles among youngsters, are always received with open  arms. Law begets law. If the junior commences a suit a senior may answer  it: and the reverse. The parson and the doctor are in perpetual  interference with the neighbors and brethren of their particular calling.  But lawyers, like bees in the beehive, must of necessity assist and succor  each other, or there will be less honey laid away when the summer is past  and the harvest ended.    Early in his professional career he became an ardent politician. He was a  Jeffersonian Democrat, and at the bar of his residence stood almost alone  in his partisan position. As such a party man he went into the State  Legislature, and became an acknowledged leader. He possessed that great  quality for a leader, the faculty of extempore speaking, joined with the  ability to condense and elucidate the topics he took in hand. But he never  submitted the convictions of his judgment to party dictation; and soon  after his entering the arena of legislative warfare, he bravely stemmed  party tide in advocating an increase of salaries for the State judges. The  latter were all federalists, and it was not to be wondered that the  republicans of that day, who wore in their noses the rings of party,  should shrug their shoulders at the prospect of benefiting political  opponents. But by his firm conduct, and by his confident assertion and  able arguments in favor of the measure, it was carried. And to Joseph  Story, more than any other man, Massachusetts is indebted for the  opportunity of employing ablest judicial officers, without making their  families beggars.    It is the disgrace of our country that its judicial officers are the most  poorly paid of all professions and pursuits. And in every section of the  Union, that distinguished lawyer who accepts a seat upon the bench, must  hold the glories of his honor at a very high price, to surrender his  ordinary professional emoluments for the wretched pittance which the  various States dole out for days of public toil and nights of private  study. We desire to look no further than this Empire State for examples.  This Empire State, with its magnificent resources and proudly developing  energies, should be the last to unite in adjudging its judicial officers  to the labors of galley slaves, and to then pay them by the year less than  a ballet-dancer receives by the month in all its principal cities. Two  thousand five hundred dollars per year is the astounding sum which this  same Empire State pays to its highest judicial officers. If we reverse the  saying of Walpole, and read \"_every price has its man_,\" we may not wonder  if Dogberries and grandmothers are occasionally found upon the bench,  dispensing their honest but destructive platitudes, and their Malaprop  constructions of commercial law, to juries of astounded merchants.    From the arena of State politics, Mr. Story next changed his position to  the temple of national discussions at Washington. His career in Congress  was, however, limited to one session, and to a vacancy-seat occasioned by  a death. He declined re-election; for in the words of his autobiographical  account of this portion of his career, he had lost all relish for  political controversy, and had found that an entire obedience to party  projects required such constant sacrifices of opinion and feeling, that he  preferred to devote himself with singleness of heart to the study of the  law, which was at all times the object of his admiration and almost  exclusive devotion. Public sentiment, however, forced him again into the  State councils at home, where more liberty of professional engagement was  permitted. He was in political life but a brief period again, before, in  his thirty-second year, President Madison"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20116"],[0,"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, Volume 1 (of 3) (#18)"],[1,"tion.    It must be admitted, however, that the gain is not always as great as  might be expected; the social advantages of a belief in ghosts and  spirits are attended by many serious drawbacks. For while ghosts or  spirits are commonly, though not always, supposed to be beyond the reach  of human vengeance, they are generally thought to be well within the  reach of human persuasion, flattery, and bribery; in other words, men  think that they can appease and propitiate them by prayer and sacrifice;  and while prayer is always cheap, sacrifice may be very dear, since it  can, and often does, involve the destruction of an immense deal of  valuable property and of a vast number of human lives. Yet if we could  reckon up the myriads who have been slain in sacrifice to ghosts and  gods, it seems probable that they would fall far short of the untold  multitudes who have perished as sorcerers and witches. For while human  sacrifices in honour of deities or of the dead have been for the most  part exceptional rather than regular, only the great gods and the  illustrious dead being deemed worthy of such costly offerings, the  slaughter of witches and wizards, theoretically at least, followed  inevitably on every natural death among people who attributed all such  deaths to sorcery. Hence if natural religion be defined roughly as a  belief in superhuman spiritual beings and an attempt to propitiate them,  we may perhaps say that, while natural religion has slain its thousands,  magic has slain its ten thousands. But there are strong reasons for  inferring that in the history of society an Age of Magic preceded an Age  of Religion. If that was so, we may conclude that the advent of religion  marked a great social as well as intellectual advance upon the preceding  Age of Magic: it inaugurated an era of what might be described as mercy  by comparison with the relentless severity of its predecessor.
