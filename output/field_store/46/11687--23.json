All the others were Noah's Ark  animals, alive, of course, but still Noah's Arky beyond possibility of  mistake. But the Hippogriff was not Noah's Ark at all.    'He came,' Mr. Noah explained, 'out of a book. One of the books you used  to build your city with.'    'Can't we have _him_?' Lucy said; 'he looks such a darling.' And the  Hippogriff turned his white velvet nose and nuzzled against her in  affectionate acknowledgment of the compliment.    'Not if you both go,' Mr. Noah explained. 'He cannot carry more than one  person at a time unless one is an Earl. No, if I may advise, I should  say go by camel.'    'Can the camel carry two?'    'Of course. He is called the ship of the desert,' Mr. Noah informed  them, 'and a ship that wouldn't carry more than one would be simply  silly.'    So _that_ was settled. Mr. Noah himself saddled and bridled the camel,  which was a very large one, with his own hands.    'Let me see,' he said, standing thoughtful with the lead rope in his  hand, 'you'll be wanting dogs--'    'I _always_ want dogs,' said Philip warmly.    '--to use in emergencies.' He whistled and two Noah's Ark dogs leaped  from their kennels to their chains' end. They were dachshunds, very long  and low, and very alike except that one was a little bigger and a little  browner than the other.    'This is your master and that's your mistress,' Mr. Noah explained to  the dogs, and they fawned round the children.    'Then you'll want things to eat and things to drink and tents and  umbrellas in case of bad weather, and---- But let's turn down this  street; just at the corner we shall find exactly what we want.'    It was a shop that said outside 'Universal Provider. Expeditions fitted  out at a moment's notice. Punctuality and dispatch.' The shopkeeper came  forward politely. He was so exactly like Mr. Noah that the children knew  who he was even before he said, 'Well, father,' and Mr. Noah said, 'This  is my son: he has had some experience in outfits.'    'What have you got to start with?' the son asked, getting to business at  once.    'Two dogs, two children, and a camel,' said Mr. Noah. 'Yes, I know it's  customary to have two of everything, but I assure you, my dear boy, that  one camel is as much as Sir Philip can manage. It is indeed.'    Mr. Noah's son very dutifully supposed that his father knew best and  willingly agreed to provide everything that was needed for the  expedition, including one best-quality talking parrot, and to deliver  all goods, carefully packed, within half an hour.          .       .       .       .       .       .       .    So now you see Philip, and Lucy who still wore her fairy dress, packed  with all their belongings on the top of a very large and wobbly camel,  and being led out of the city by the usual procession, with seven bands  of music all playing 'See the Conquering Hero goes,' quite a different  tune from the one you know, which has a name a little like that.    The camel and its load were rather a tight fit for the particular  gateway that they happened to go out by, and the children had to stoop  to avoid scraping their heads against the top of the arch. But they got  through all right, and now they were well on the road which was really  little more than a field path running through the flowery meadow country  where the dragon had been killed. They saw the Stonehenge ruins and the  big tower far away to the left, and in front lay the vast and  interesting expanse of the Absolutely Unknown.    The sun was shining--there was a sun, and Mr. Noah had told the  children that it came out of the poetry books, together with rain and  flowers and the changing seasons--and in spite of the strange,  almost-tumble-no-it's-all-right-but-you'd-better-look-out way in which  the camel walked, the two travellers were very happy. The dogs bounded  along in the best of spirits, and even the camel seemed less a prey than  usual to that proud melancholy which you must have noticed in your  visits to the Zoo as his most striking quality.    It was certainly very grand to ride on a camel, and Lucy tried not to  think how difficult it would be to get on and off. The parrot was  interesting too. It talked extremely well. Of course you understand  that, if you can only make a parrot understand, it can tell you  everything you want to know about other animals; because it understands  _their_ talk quite naturally and without being made. The present parrot  declined ordinary conversation, and when questioned only recited poetry  of a rather dull kind that went on and on. 'Arms and the man I sing' it  began, and then something about haughty Juno. Its voice was soothing,  and riding on the camel was not unlike being rocked in a very bumpety  cradle. The children were securely seated in things like padded  panniers, and they had had an exciting day. As the sun set, which it did  quite soon, the parrot called out to the nearest dog, 'I say, Max,  they're asleep.'    [Illustration: On the top of a very large and wobbly camel.]    'I don't wonder,' said Max. 'But it's all right. Humpty knows the way.'    'Keep a civil tongue in your head, you young dog, can't you?' said the  camel grumpily.    'Don't be cross, darling,' said the other dog, whose name was Brenda,  'and be sure you stop at a really first-class oasis for the night. But I  know we can trust _you_, dear.'    The camel muttered that it was all very well, but his voice was not  quite as cross as before.    After that the expedition went on in silence through the deepening  twilight.    A tumbling, shaking, dumping sensation, more like a soft railway  accident than anything else, awakened our travellers, and they found  that the camel was kneeling down.    'Off you come,' said the parrot, 'and make the fire and boil the  kettle.'    'Polly put the kettle on,' Lucy said absently, as she slid down to the  ground; to which the parrot replied, 'Certainly not. I wish you wouldn't  rake up that old story. It was quite false. I never did put a kettle on,  and I never will.'    Why should I describe to you the adventure of camping at an oasis in a  desert? You must all have done it many times; or if you have not done  it, you have read about it. You know all about the well and the palm  trees and the dates and things. They had cocoa for supper. It was great  fun, and they slept soundly and awoke in the morning with a heart for  any fate, as a respectable poet puts it.    The next day was just the same as the first, only instead of going  through fresh green fields, the way lay through dry yellow desert. And  again the children slept, and again the camel chose an oasis with  remarkable taste and judgment. But the second night was not at all the  same as the first. For in the middle of it the parrot awakened Philip by  biting his ear, and then hopping to a safe distance from his awakening  fists and crying out, 'Make up the camp fire--look alive. It's lions.'  The dogs were whining and barking, and Brenda was earnestly trying to  climb a palm tree. Max faced the danger, it is true, but he seemed to  have no real love of sport.    Philip sprang up and heaped dead palm scales and leaves on the dying  fire. It blazed up and something moved beyond the bushes. Philip  wondered whether those pairs of shining things, like strayed stars, that  he saw in the darkness, could really be the eyes of lions.    'What a nuisance these lions are to be sure,' said the parrot. 'No, they  won't come near us while the fire's burning, but really, they ought to  be put down by law.'    'Why doesn't somebody kill them?' Lucy asked. She had wakened when  Philip did, and, after a meditative minute, had helped with the palm  scales and things.    'It's not so easy,' said the parrot; 'nobody knows how to do it. How  would _you_ kill a lion?'    '_I_ don't know,' said Philip; but Lucy said, 'Are they Noah's Ark  lions?'    'Of course they are,' said Polly; 'all the books with lions in them are  kept shut up.'    'I know how you could kill Noah's Ark lions if you could catch them,'  Lucy said.    'It's easy enough to catch them,' said Polly; 'an hour after dawn they  go to sleep, but it's unsportsmanlike to kill game when it's asleep.'    'I'm going to think, if you don't mind,' Lucy announced, and sat down  very near the fire. 'It's just the opposite of the dragon,' she said  after a minute. The parrot nodded and there was a long silence. Then  suddenly Lucy jumped up.    'I know,' she cried, 'oh--I really _do_ know. And it won't hurt them  either. I don't a bit mind killing things, but I do hate hurting them.  There's plenty of rope, I know.'    There was.    'Then when it's dawn we'll tie them up and then you'll see.'    'I think you might tell _me_,' said Philip, injured.    'No--they may understand what we say. Polly does.'    Philip made a natural suggestion. But Lucy replied that it was not  manners to whisper, and the parrot said that it should think not indeed.    So, sitting by the fire, all faces turned to where those strange twin  stars shone and those strange hidden movements and rustlings stirred,  the expedition waited for the dawn. Brenda had given up the  tree-climbing idea, and was cuddling up as close to Lucy as possible.  The camel, who had been trembling with fear all the while, tried to  cuddle up to Philip, which would have been easier if it had been a  smaller kind instead of being, as it was, what Mr. Noah's son, the  Universal Provider, had called, 'an out size in camels.'    And presently dawn came, not slow and silvery as dawns come here, but  sudden and red, with strong level lights and the shadows of the palm  trees stretching all across the desert.    In broad daylight it did not seem so hard to have to go and look for the  lions. They all went--even the camel pulled himself together to join the  lion-hunt, and Brenda herself decided to come rather than be left alone.

They may, by stretching their understandings a little wider,  comprehend, that all those who by undertaking large quantities of  manufacture, and affording employment to many labourers, make themselves  considered as benefactors to the publick, have only been robbing their  workmen with one hand, and their customers with the other.  If Crowley  had sold only what he could make, and all his smiths had wrought their  own iron with their own hammers, he would have lived on less, and they  would have sold their work for more.  The salaries of superintendents and  clerks would have been partly saved, and partly shared, and nails been  sometimes cheaper by a farthing in a hundred.  But then if the smith  could not have found an immediate purchaser, he must have deserted his  anvil; if there had by accident at any time been more sellers than  buyers, the workmen must have reduced their profit to nothing, by  underselling one another; and as no great stock could have been in any  hand, no sudden demand of large quantities could have been answered and  the builder must have stood still till the nailer could supply him.    According to these schemes, universal plenty is to begin and end in  universal misery.  Hope and emulation will be utterly extinguished; and  as all must obey the call of immediate necessity, nothing that requires  extensive views, or provides for distant consequences will ever be  performed.    To the southern inhabitants of Scotland, the state of the mountains and  the islands is equally unknown with that of Borneo or Sumatra: Of both  they have only heard a little, and guess the rest.  They are strangers to  the language and the manners, to the advantages and wants of the people,  whose life they would model, and whose evils they would remedy.    Nothing is less difficult than to procure one convenience by the  forfeiture of another.  A soldier may expedite his march by throwing away  his arms.  To banish the Tacksman is easy, to make a country plentiful by  diminishing the people, is an expeditious mode of husbandry; but little  abundance, which there is nobody to enjoy, contributes little to human  happiness.    As the mind must govern the hands, so in every society the man of  intelligence must direct the man of labour.  If the Tacksmen be taken  away, the Hebrides must in their present state be given up to grossness  and ignorance; the tenant, for want of instruction, will be unskilful,  and for want of admonition will be negligent.  The Laird in these wide  estates, which often consist of islands remote from one another, cannot  extend his personal influence to all his tenants; and the steward having  no dignity annexed to his character, can have little authority among men  taught to pay reverence only to birth, and who regard the Tacksman as  their hereditary superior; nor can the steward have equal zeal for the  prosperity of an estate profitable only to the Laird, with the Tacksman,  who has the Laird's income involved in his own.    The only gentlemen in the Islands are the Lairds, the Tacksmen, and the  Ministers, who frequently improve their livings by becoming farmers.  If  the Tacksmen be banished, who will be left to impart knowledge, or  impress civility?  The Laird must always be at a distance from the  greater part of his lands; and if he resides at all upon them, must drag  his days in solitude, having no longer either a friend or a companion; he  will therefore depart to some more comfortable residence, and leave the  tenants to the wisdom and mercy of a factor.    Of tenants there are different orders, as they have greater or less  stock.  Land is sometimes leased to a small fellowship, who live in a  cluster of huts, called a Tenants Town, and are bound jointly and  separately for the payment of their rent.  These, I believe, employ in  the care of their cattle, and the labour of tillage, a kind of tenants  yet lower; who having a hut with grass for a certain number of cows and  sheep, pay their rent by a stipulated quantity of labour.    The condition of domestick servants, or the price of occasional labour, I  do not know with certainty.  I was told that the maids have sheep, and  are allowed to spin for their own clothing; perhaps they have no  pecuniary wages, or none but in very wealthy families.  The state of  life, which has hitherto been purely pastoral, begins now to be a little  variegated with commerce; but novelties enter by degrees, and till one  mode has fully prevailed over the other, no settled notion can be formed.    Such is the system of insular subordination, which, having little  variety, cannot afford much delight in the view, nor long detain the mind  in contemplation.  The inhabitants were for a long time perhaps not  unhappy; but their content was a muddy mixture of pride and ignorance, an  indifference for pleasures which they did not know, a blind veneration  for their chiefs, and a strong conviction of their own importance.    Their pride has been crushed by the heavy hand of a vindictive conqueror,  whose seventies have been followed by laws, which, though they cannot be  called cruel, have produced much discontent, because they operate upon  the surface of life, and make every eye bear witness to subjection.  To  be compelled to a new dress has always been found painful.    Their Chiefs being now deprived of their jurisdiction, have already lost  much of their influence; and as they gradually degenerate from  patriarchal rulers to rapacious landlords, they will divest themselves of  the little that remains.    That dignity which they derived from an opinion of their military  importance, the law, which disarmed them, has abated.  An old gentleman,  delighting himself with the recollection of better days, related, that  forty years ago, a Chieftain walked out attended by ten or twelve  followers, with their arms rattling.  That animating rabble has now  ceased.  The Chief has lost his formidable retinue; and the Highlander  walks his heath unarmed and defenceless, with the peaceable submission of  a French peasant or English cottager.    Their ignorance grows every day less, but their knowledge is yet of  little other use than to shew them their wants.  They are now in the  period of education, and feel the uneasiness of discipline, without yet  perceiving the benefit of instruction.    The last law, by which the Highlanders are deprived of their arms, has  operated with efficacy beyond expectation.  Of former statutes made with  the same design, the execution had been feeble, and the effect  inconsiderable.  Concealment was undoubtedly practised, and perhaps often  with connivance.  There was tenderness, or partiality, on one side, and  obstinacy on the other.  But the law, which followed the victory of  Culloden, found the whole nation dejected and intimidated; informations  were given without danger, and without fear, and the arms were collected  with such rigour, that every house was despoiled of its defence.    To disarm part of the Highlands, could give no reasonable occasion of  complaint.  Every government must be allowed the power of taking away the  weapon that is lifted against it.  But the loyal clans murmured, with  some appearance of justice, that after having defended the King, they  were forbidden for the future to defend themselves; and that the sword  should be forfeited, which had been legally employed.  Their case is  undoubtedly hard, but in political regulations, good cannot be complete,  it can only be predominant.    Whether by disarming a people thus broken into several tribes, and thus  remote from the seat of power, more good than evil has been produced, may  deserve inquiry.  The supreme power in every community has the right of  debarring every individual, and every subordinate society from  self-defence, only because the supreme power is able to defend them; and  therefore where the governor cannot act, he must trust the subject to act  for himself.  These Islands might be wasted with fire and sword before  their sovereign would know their distress.  A gang of robbers, such as  has been lately found confederating themselves in the Highlands, might  lay a wide region under contribution.  The crew of a petty privateer  might land on the largest and most wealthy of the Islands, and riot  without control in cruelty and waste.  It was observed by one of the  Chiefs of Sky, that fifty armed men might, without resistance ravage the  country.  Laws that place the subjects in such a state, contravene the  first principles of the compact of authority: they exact obedience, and  yield no protection.    It affords a generous and manly pleasure to conceive a little nation  gathering its fruits and tending its herds with fearless confidence,  though it lies open on every side to invasion, where, in contempt of  walls and trenches, every man sleeps securely with his sword beside him;  where all on the first approach of hostility came together at the call to  battle, as at a summons to a festal show; and committing their cattle to  the care of those whom age or nature has disabled, engage the enemy with  that competition for hazard and for glory, which operate in men that  fight under the eye of those, whose dislike or kindness they have always  considered as the greatest evil or the greatest good.    This was, in the beginning of the present century, the state of the  Highlands.  Every man was a soldier, who partook of national confidence,  and interested himself in national honour.  To lose this spirit, is to  lose what no small advantage will compensate.    It may likewise deserve to be inquired, whether a great nation ought to  be totally commercial? whether amidst the uncertainty of human affairs,  too much attention to one mode of happiness may not endanger others?  whether the pride of riches must not "]]]
