Though Leonardo's accomplishment seems slight because of the little  that is left to us, yet he had a great following not only among the  Florentines but at Milan, where Vincenza Foppa had started a school in  the Early Renaissance time. Leonardo was there for fourteen years, and  his artistic personality influenced many painters to adopt his type  and methods. Bernardino Luini (1475?-1532?) was the most prominent of  the disciples. He cultivated Leonardo's sentiment, style, subjects,  and composition in his middle period, but later on developed  independence and originality. He came at a period of art when that  earnestness of characterization which marked the early men was giving  way to gracefulness of recitation, and that was the chief feature of  his art. For that matter gracefulness and pathetic sweetness of mood,  with purity of line and warmth of color characterized all the Milanese  painters.    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--LUINI. DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS WITH HEAD OF JOHN  THE BAPTIST. UFFIZI.]    The more prominent lights of the school were Salaino (fl. 1495-1518),  of whose work nothing authentic exists, Boltraffio (1467-1516), a  painter of limitations but of much refinement and purity, and Marco da  Oggiono (1470?-1530) a close follower of Leonardo. Solario  (1458?-1515?) probably became acquainted early with the Flemish mode  of working practised by Antonello da Messina, but he afterward came  under Leonardo's spell at Milan. He was a careful, refined painter,  possessed of feeling and tenderness, producing pictures with enamelled  surfaces and much detail. Gianpietrino (fl. 1520-1540) and Cesare da  Sesto (1477-1523?) were also of the Milanese school, the latter  afterward falling under the Raphael influence. Gaudenzio Ferrara  (1481?-1547?), an exceptionally brilliant colorist and a painter of  much distinction, was under Leonardo's influence at one time, and  with the teachings of that master he mingled a little of Raphael in  the type of face. He was an uneven painter, often excessive in  sentiment, but at his best one of the most charming of the northern  painters.    SODOMA AND THE SIENNESE: Sienna, alive in the fourteenth century to  all that was stirring in art, in the fifteenth century was in complete  eclipse, no painters of consequence emanating from there or being  established there. In the sixteenth century there was a revival of art  because of a northern painter settling there and building up a new  school. This painter was Sodoma (1477?-1549). He was one of the best  pupils of Leonardo da Vinci, a master of the human figure, handling it  with much grace and charm of expression, but not so successful with  groups or studied compositions, wherein he was inclined to huddle and  over-crowd space. He was afterward led off by the brilliant success of  Raphael, and adopted something of that master's style. His best work  was done in fresco, though he did some easel pictures that have  darkened very much through time. He was a friend of Raphael, and his  portrait appears beside Raphael's in the latter painter's celebrated  School of Athens. The pupils and followers of the Siennese School were  not men of great strength. Pacchiarotta (1474-1540?), Girolamo della  Pacchia (1477-1535), Peruzzi (1481-1536), a half-Lombard half-Umbrian  painter of ability, and Beccafumi (1486-1551) were the principal  lights. The influence of the school was slight.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--SODOMA. ECSTASY OF ST. CATHERINE. SIENNA.]    FERRARA AND BOLOGNESE SCHOOLS: The painters of these schools during  the sixteenth century have usually been classed among the followers  and imitators of Raphael, but not without some injustice. The  influence of Raphael was great throughout Central Italy, and the  Ferrarese and Bolognese felt it, but not to the extinction of their  native thought and methods. Moreover, there was some influence in  color coming from the Venetian school, but again not to the entire  extinction of Ferrarese individuality. Dosso Dossi (1479?-1541), at  Ferrara, a pupil of Lorenzo Costa, was the chief painter of the time,  and he showed more of Giorgione in color and light-and-shade than  anyone else, yet he never abandoned the yellows, greens, and reds  peculiar to Ferrara, and both he and Garofolo were strikingly original  in their background landscapes. Garofolo (1481-1559) was a pupil of  Panetti and Costa, who made several visits to Rome and there fell in  love with Raphael's work, which showed in a fondness for the sweep and  flow of line, in the type of face adopted, and in the calmness of his  many easel pictures. He was not so dramatic a painter as Dosso, and in  addition he had certain mannerisms or earmarks, such as sootiness in  his flesh tints and brightness in his yellows and greens, with dulness  in his reds. He was always Ferrarese in his landscapes and in the main  characteristics of his technic. Mazzolino (1478?-1528?) was another of  the school, probably a pupil of Panetti. He was an elaborate painter,  fond of architectural backgrounds and glowing colors enlivened with  gold in the high lights. Bagnacavallo (1484-1542) was a pupil of  Francia at Bologna, but with much of Dosso and Ferrara about him. He,  in common with Imola, already mentioned, was indebted to the art of  Raphael.    CORREGGIO AT PARMA: In Correggio (1494?-1534) all the Boccaccio nature  of the Renaissance came to the surface. It was indicated in Andrea del  Sarto--this nature-worship--but Correggio was the consummation. He was  the Faun of the Renaissance, the painter with whom the beauty of the  human as distinguished from the religious and the classic showed at  its very strongest. Free animal spirits, laughing madonnas, raving  nymphs, excited children of the wood, and angels of the sky pass and  repass through his pictures in an atmosphere of pure sensuousness.  They appeal to us not religiously, not historically, not  intellectually, but sensuously and artistically through their rhythmic  lines, their palpitating flesh, their beauty of color, and in the  light and atmosphere that surround them. He was less of a religionist  than Andrea del Sarto. Religion in art was losing ground in his day,  and the liberality and worldliness of its teachers appeared clearly  enough in the decorations of the Convent of St. Paul at Parma, where  Correggio was allowed to paint mythological Dianas and Cupids in the  place of saints and madonnas. True enough, he painted the religious  subject very often, but with the same spirit of life and joyousness as  profane subjects.    [Illustration: FIG. 46--CORREGGIO. MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE AND  CHRIST. LOUVRE.]    The classic subject seemed more appropriate to his spirit, and yet he  knew and probably cared less about it than the religious subject. His  Dianas and Ledas are only so in name. They have little of the  Hellenic spirit about them, and for the sterner, heroic phases of  classicism--the lofty, the grand--Correggio never essayed them. The  things of this earth and the sweetness thereof seemed ever his aim.  Women and children were beautiful to him in the same way that flowers  and trees and skies and sunsets were beautiful. They were revelations  of grace, charm, tenderness, light, shade, color. Simply to exist and  be glad in the sunlight was sweetness to Correggio. He would have no  Sibylesque mystery, no prophetic austerity, no solemnity, no great  intellectuality. He was no leader of a tragic chorus. The dramatic,  the forceful, the powerful, were foreign to his mood. He was a singer  of lyrics and pastorals, a lover of the material beauty about him, and  it is because he passed by the pietistic, the classic, the literary,  and showed the beauty of physical life as an art motive that he is  called the Faun of the Renaissance. The appellation is not  inappropriate.    How or why he came to take this course would be hard to determine. It  was reflective of the times; but Correggio, so far as history tells  us, had little to do with the movements and people of his age. He was  born and lived and died near Parma, and is sometimes classed among the  Bologna-Ferrara painters, but the reasons for the classification are  not too strong. His education, masters, and influences are all shadowy  and indefinite. He seems, from his drawing and composition, to have  known something of Mantegna at Mantua; from his coloring something of  Dosso and Garofolo, especially in his straw-yellows; from his early  types and faces something of Costa and Francia, and his contours and  light-and-shade indicate a knowledge of Leonardo's work. But there is  no positive certainty that he saw the work of any of these men.    His drawing was faulty at times, but not obtrusively so; his color and  brush-work rich, vivacious, spirited; his light brilliant, warm,  penetrating; his contours melting, graceful; his atmosphere  omnipresent, enveloping. In composition he rather pushed aside line in  favor of light and color. It was his technical peculiarity that he  centralized his light and surrounded it by darks as a foil. And in  this very feature he was one of the first men in Renaissance Italy to  paint a picture for the purpose of weaving a scheme of lights and  darks through a tapestry of rich colors. That is art for art's sake,  and that, as will be seen further on, was the picture motive of the  great Venetians.    Correggio's immediate pupils and followers, like those of Raphael and  Andrea del Sarto, did him small honor. As was usually the case in  Renaissance art-history they caught at the method and lost the spirit  of the master. His son, Pomponio Allegri (1521-1593?), was a painter  of some mark without being in the front rank. Michelangelo Anselmi  (1491-1554?), though not a pupil, was an indifferent imitator of  Correggio. Parmigianino (1504-1540), a mannered painter of some  brilliancy, and of excellence in portraits,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18908"],[0,"Christmas (#18)"],[1,"ld,        And the stars shine on the snow,      Or wild is the blast and the bitter sleet        That beats on the window-pane;      But blest on the frosty hills are the feet        Of the Christmas time again!          Chiming sweet when the night wind swells,          Blest is the sound of the Christmas Bells!        Dear are the sounds of the Christmas chimes        In the land of the ivied towers,      And they welcome the dearest of festival times        In this Western world of ours!      Bright on the holly and mistletoe bough        The English firelight falls,      And bright are the wreathed evergreens now        That gladden our own home walls!          And hark! the first sweet note that tells,          The welcome of the Christmas Bells!        The owl that sits in the ivy's shade,        Remote from the ruined tower,      Shall start from his drowsy watch afraid        When the clock shall strike the hour;      And over the fields in their frosty rhyme        The cheery sounds shall go,      And chime shall answer unto chime        Across the moonlit snow!          How sweet the lingering music dwells,--          The music of the Christmas Bells.        It fell not thus in the East afar        Where the Babe in the manger lay;      The wise men followed their guiding star        To the dawn of a milder day;      And the fig and the sycamore gathered green,        And the palm-tree of Deborah rose;      'Twas the strange first Christmas the world had seen--        And it came not in storm and snows.          Not yet on Nazareth's hills and dells          Had floated the sound of Christmas Bells.        The cedars of Lebanon shook in the blast        Of their own cold mountain air;      But nought o'er the wintry plain had passed        To tell that the Lord was there!      The oak and the olive and almond were still,        In the night now worn and thin;      No wind of the winter-time roared from the hill        To waken the guests at the inn;          No dream to them the music tells          That is to come from the Christmas Bells!        The years that have fled like the leaves on the gale        Since the morn of the Miracle-Birth,      Have widened the fame of the marvellous tale        Till the tidings have filled the earth!      And so in the climes of the icy North,        And the lands of the cane and the palm,      By the Alpine cotter's blazing hearth,        And in tropic belts of calm,          Men list to-night the welcome swells,          Sweet and clear, of Christmas Bells!        They are ringing to-night through the Norway firs,        And across the Swedish fells,      And the Cuban palm-tree dreamily stirs        To the sound of those Christmas Bells!      They ring where the Indian Ganges rolls        Its flood through the rice-fields wide;      They swell the far hymns of the Lapps and Poles        To the praise of the Crucified.          Sweeter than tones of the ocean's shells          Mingle the chimes of the Christmas Bells!        The years come not back that have circled away        With the past of the Eastern land,      When He plucked the corn on the Sabbath day        And healed the withered hand:      But the bells shall join in a joyous chime        For the One who walked the sea,      And ring again for the better time        Of the Christ that is to be!          Then ring!--for earth's best promise dwells          In ye, O joyous Prophet Bells!        Ring out at the meeting of night and morn        For the dawn of a happier day!      Lo, the stone from our faith's great sepulchre torn        The angels have rolled away!      And they come to us here in our low abode,        With words like the sunrise gleam,--      Come down and ascend by that heavenly road        That Jacob saw in his dream.          Spirit of love, that in music dwells,          Open our hearts with the Christmas Bells!        Help us to see that the glad heart prays        As well as the bended knees;      That there are in our own as in ancient days        The Scribes and the Pharisees;      That the Mount of Transfiguration still        Looks down on these Christian lands,      And the glorified ones from that holy hill        Are reaching their helping hands.          These be the words our music tells          Of solemn joy, O Christmas Bells!           *       *       *       *       *        THE BIRTH OF CHRIST        ALFRED TENNYSON        The time draws near the birth of Christ;        The moon is hid--the night is still;        The Christmas bells from hill to hill      Answer each other in the mist.        Four voices of four hamlets round,        From far and near, on mead and moor,        Swell out and fail, as if a door      Were shut between me and the sound.        Each voice four changes on the wind,        That now dilate and now decrease,        Peace and good-will, good-will and peace,      Peace and good-will to all mankind.        Rise, happy morn! rise, holy morn!        Draw forth the cheerful day from night;        O Father! touch the east, and light      The light that shone when hope was born!           *       *       *       *       *        THE CHRISTMAS CAROL        WILLIAM WORDSWORTH        The minstrels played their Christmas tune        To-night beneath my cottage eaves;      While, smitten by a lofty moon,        The encircling laurels, thick with leaves,      Gave back a rich and dazzling sheen      That overpowered their natural green.        Through hill and valley every breeze        Had sunk to rest, with folded wings:      Keen was the air, but could not freeze        Nor check the music of the strings;      So stout and hardy were the band      That scraped the chords with strenuous hand!        And who but listened--till was paid        Respect to every inmate's claim:      The greeting given, the music played,        In honor of each household name,      Duly pronounced with lusty call,      And \"Merry Christmas\" wished to all!        How touching, when, at midnight, sweep        Snow-muffled winds, and all is dark,      To hear, and sink again to sleep!        Or, at an earlier call, to mark      By blazing fire, the still suspense      Of self-complacent innocence;        The mutual nod,--the grave disguise        Of hearts with gladness brimming o'er;      And some unbidden tears that rise        For names once heard, and heard no more;      Tears brightened by the serenade      For infant in the cradle laid.        Hail ancient Manners! sure defence,        Where they survive, of wholesome laws;      Remnants of love whose modest sense        Thus into narrow room withdraws;      Hail, Usages of pristine mould,      And ye that guard them, Mountains old!           *       *       *       *       *    CHRISTMAS AT FEZZIWIG'S WAREHOUSE    CHARLES DICKENS    \"Yo ho! my boys,\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night; Christmas Eve,  Dick! Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,\" cried old  Fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack  Robinson....\"    \"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with  wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room  here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Cheer up, Ebenezer!\"    Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or  couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in  a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from  public life forevermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were  trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug,  and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to see  upon a winter's night.    In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk and  made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs.  Fezziwig, one vast, substantial smile. In came the three Misses  Fezziwig, beaming and lovable. In came the six followers whose hearts  they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business  In came the housemaid with her cousin the baker. In came the cook with  her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy from over  the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master,  trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was  proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress; in they all came,  anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands  half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again;  round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping, old top  couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off  again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a  bottom one to help them.    When this result was brought about the fiddler struck up \"Sir Roger de  Coverley.\" Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top  couple, too, with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or  four and twenty pairs of partners; people who were not to be trifled  with; people who would dance and had no notion of walking.    But if they had been thrice as many--Oh, four times as many--old  Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig.  As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term.  If that's not high praise, tell me higher and I'll use it. A positive  light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part  of the dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted at any given time  what would become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig  had gone all through the dance; advance and retire; both hands to your  partner, bow and courtesy, corkscrew, thread the needle, and back again  to your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly that he appeared to wink  with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.
