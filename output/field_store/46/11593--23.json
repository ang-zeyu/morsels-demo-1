He is at an altitude of sixty-seven meters, exactly at the spring of the  cupola and the beginning of the Vasari frescoes; the feet are at an  elevation of one meter less than is that of the lower tops of Notre Dame  de Paris, and yet the dome follows away overhead, huge enough, high  enough to contain a second church piled, Pelion-like upon the first.  Before, in the dimness, is the vastest roof-covered void in the world;  it is terrific, and if the visitor is susceptible, his knees shake, and  his diaphragm seems to sink to meet them.    The impression is tremendous; no wonder that the Tuscans felt  Brunelleschi to be the central figure of the Renaissance. Again and  again, whether in the gallery or between the walls of the dome, the  thought comes; men built this, and one man dared it and planned it. Not  even the Pyramids impress more strongly; for if Brunelleschi built a  lesser pyramid, he hollowed his and hung it in the air.    On the other side of the space, a small black spot becomes a door when  the traveler has giddily circled half the dome; it opens upon another  staircase, up which he climbs between the two skins of the cupola, or  rather between two of the three, like a parasite upon a monster.  Sometimes the place suggests a ship, with the oculi as gunports,  piercing to the outer day, or else, his mind fresh from that red inferno  of Vasari's frescoes, the traveler is tunneling up through a volcanic  crater with a whole Typhonic Enceladus buried below.    To right and left, the smooth, cemented surface curves away and upward,  brick buttresses appear constantly, but always with the courses of brick  laid slanting to the earth's level, and perpendicular to the thrust of  the dome. Every possible effect of light and obscurity makes the strange  vistas yet more weird, and, now and then, there is a feeling of standing  upon the vast, rounding slope of some planet that shines at one's feet,  then gradually falls away into the surrounding blackness.    The famous \"oaken chain\" of Vasari's life of Brunelleschi is there,  bolted together in successive beams. Last of all, a long, straight  staircase, straight because without turn to right or left, curves upward  like an unradiant, bowed Valhalla-bridge to a great burst of daylight,  and the climber is upon the top of the dome.    He is as completely cut off from the immediately surrounding earth as  upon a cloud girdled mountain, for the dome swells so vastly below that  the piazza can not be seen about transept or choir, and not one of the  apsidal domes shows a tile of its covering, while the nave, that huge  and tremendous nave of Santa Maria, looks but a narrow, and a distant  roof. At one's back, the marble of the lantern is handsome and creamy in  color, but battered and broken; its interior is curious--a narrow funnel  of marble, little wider than a man's body, set with irons on either  side, is the only ladder, so that the climb up is a close squeeze. There  is a familiar something gone from the surroundings, and that something  is soon remembered to be Dante's baptistery, which does not exist from  Brunelleschi's dome, being blotted out by the facade of Santa Maria. One  hundred feet below, showing its upper and richer portion gloriously from  this novel point of view, is what from the piazza is the soaring bell  tower, the Campanile of Giotto.          ARNOLFO, GIOTTO, BRUNELLESCHI[33]    BY MRS. OLIPHANT      Arnolfo, sometimes called di Cambio and sometimes di Lapi, was the first  of the group of Cathedral builders in Florence. Who Arnolfo was seems to  be scarcely known, tho few architects after him have left greater works  or more evidence of power. His first authentic appearance in history is  among the band of workmen engaged upon the pulpit in the Duomo at Siena,  as pupil or journeyman of Niccolo Pisano, the great reviver of the art  of sculpture--when he becomes visible in company with a certain Lapo,  who is sometimes called his father (as by Vasari) and sometimes his  instructor, but who appears actually to have been nothing more than his  fellow-workman and associate....    The Cathedral, the Palazzo Pubblico, the two great churches of Santa  Croce and Santa Maria Novella, all leaped into being within a few years,  almost simultaneously. The Duomo was founded, as some say, in 1294, the  same year in which Santa Croce was begun, or, according to others, in  1298; and between these two dates, in 1296, the Palace of the Signoria,  the seat of the Commonwealth, the center of all public life, had its  commencement. All these great buildings, Arnolfo designed and began, and  his genius requires no other evidence. The stern strength of the  Palazzo, upright and strong like a knight in mail, and the large and  noble lines of the Cathedral, ample and liberal and majestic in ornate  robes and wealthy ornaments, show how well he knew to vary and adapt his  art to the different requirements of municipal and religious life and to  the necessities of the age.    We are not informed who they were who carried out the design of the  Duomo. Arnolfo only lived to see a portion of this, his greatest work,  completed--\"the three principal tribunes which were under the cupola,\"  and which Vasari tells us were so solid and strongly built as to be able  to bear the full weight of Brunelleschi's dome, which was much larger  and heavier than the one the original architect had himself designed.  Arnolfo died when he had built his Palazzo in rugged strength, as it  still stands, with walls like living rock and heavy Tuscan cornices--tho  it was reserved to the other masters to put upon it the wonderful crown  of its appropriate tower--and just as the round apse of the cathedral  approached completion; a hard fate for a great builder to leave such  noble work behind him half done, yet the most common of all fates. He  died, so far as there is any certainty in dates, in 1300, during the  brief period of Dante's power in Florence, when the poet was one of the  priors and much engaged in public business; and the same eventful year  concluded the existence of Cimabue, the first of the great school of  Florentine painters--he whose picture was carried home to the church in  which it was to dwell for all the intervening centuries with such pride  and acclamation that the Borgo Allegri is said to have taken its name  from this wonderful rejoicing....    No more notable or distinct figure than Giotto is in all the history of  Florence. He was born a peasant, in the village of Vespignano in the  Mugello, the same district which afterward gave birth to Fra Angelico.  Giotto had at least part of his professional training in the great  cathedral at Assisi built over the bones of St. Francis, was one of  those homely, vigorous souls, \"a natural person,\" like his father, whom  neither the lapse of centuries nor the neighborhood of much greater and  more striking persons about them, can deprive of their naive and genuine  individuality. Burly, homely, characteristic, he carries our attentions  always with him, alike on the silent road, or in the king's palace, or  his own simple shop. Wherever he is, he is always the same, shrewd,  humorous, plain-spoken, seeing through all pretenses, yet never  ill-natured in doing so--a character not very lofty or elevated, and to  which the racy ugliness of a strong, uncultivated race seems  natural--but who under that homely nature carried appreciations and  conceptions of beauty such as few fine minds possess.    Of all the beautiful things with which Giotto adorned his city, not one  speaks so powerfully to the foreign visitor--the forestiere whom he and  his fellows never took into account, tho who occupy so large a space  among the admirers of his genius nowadays--as the lovely Campanile which  stands by the great cathedral like the white royal lily beside the Mary  of the Annunciation, slender and strong and everlasting in its delicate  grace. It is not often that a man takes up a new trade when he is  approaching sixty, or even goes into a new path out of his familiar  routine. But Giotto seems to have turned without a moment's hesitation  from his paints and panels to the less easily-wrought materials of the  builder and sculptor, without either faltering from the great enterprise  or doubting his own power to do it. His frescoes and altarpieces and  crucifixes, the work he had been so long accustomed to, and which he  could execute pleasantly in his own workshop or on the cool new walls of  church or convent, with his trained school of younger artists round to  aid him, were as different as possible from the elaborate calculations  and measurements by which alone the lofty tower, straight, and lightsome  as a lily, could have sprung so high and stood so lightly against that  Italian sky.    Like the poet or the romancist when he turns from the flowery ways of  fiction and invention, where he is unencumbered by any restrictions save  those of artistic keeping and personal will, to the grave and beaten  path of history--the painter must have felt when he too turned from the  freedom and poetry of art to this first scientific undertaking. The  Cathedral was so far finished by this time, its front not scarred and  bare as afterward, but adorned with statues according to old Arnolfo's  plan, who was dead more than thirty years before; but there was no  belfry, no companion peal of peace and sweetness to balance the hoarse  old vacca with its voice of iron.    Giotto seems to have thrown himself into work not only without  reluctance but with enthusiasm. The foundation-stone of the building was  laid in July of that year, with all the greatness of Florence looking  on; and the painter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#18)"],[1,"la Russe_, but are brought round in  order that one may help one's self. Just as one is struggling into  conversation in defective German, a pike's head obtrudes itself over the  left shoulder, and it is necessary to twist in one's seat and go  through a gymnastic performance to take a helping.    Except in large cities the Germans are not given to feeding at  restaurants.    A golden rule, which may be held to apply all over Germany, is that it  is safe to take ladies wherever officers go _in uniform_.      The Rathskeller    In most German towns where there is a Rathhaus (a town hall) one finds  the Rathskeller, where beers or wine, according to the part of the  country, are the principal attraction, single dishes, cutlets, steaks,  cold meats, oysters, caviar being served more as an adjunct to the drink  than as an orthodox meal. The most noted of these Rathskeller are at  Bremen, Luebeck, and Hamburg, and that at Bremen is first in importance.  It is a mediaeval Gothic hall, built 1405-1410, and it holds the finest  stock of Rhine and Moselle wine in the world. The wine is kept in very  old casks. One of the cellars is of particular interest as being the  \"Rose\" one, where the magistrates used to sit in secret conclave, _sub  rosa_, beneath the great rose carved upon the ceiling. The German  Emperor generally pays a visit to the Rathskeller when he visits Bremen.    In the Luebeck Rathskeller is the \"admiral's table,\" said to be made from  a plank of the ship of the last Admiral of Luebeck, who flourished in  1570; and even more interesting than the Rathskeller is the  Schiffergesellschaft, with its strange motto and its even stranger  sign.      Beer-Cellars    Throughout Germany one meets in every town the large establishments,  beautifully decorated in the \"Old German\" style, of the various beer  companies, most of which are Munich ones, the Lowenbrau, the  Pschorrbrau, the Muenchener Hofbrau, and others. Be careful to close the  metal top of your Schopps if you are drinking with German companions,  for if you do not they have the right, by the custom of the country, to  place their mugs on the top of the open one and demand another \"round.\"  If when you have emptied your mug, you leave it with the lid open, the  waiter, without asking any questions, takes it away and refills it.    I now once more step down to allow A.B. to chat about the various German  towns.      Dresden    Dresden is not exactly an epicure's paradise, but there is one  restaurant which may, I think, be safely recommended as an establishment  of the first order. I am referring to the Englischer Garten, which is  managed by its proprietor, Herr Curt Roething. The principal entrance is  through a rather dingy looking archway in the Waisenhausstrasse, nearly  opposite the Victoria Salon Music Hall. The principal public rooms are  on the ground floor. The decorations used to be of a very dismal type,  but a year or two ago the rooms were all done up, and, without being  palatial or particularly artistic, they are now quite nice and bright in  their way.    There are also some rooms on the first floor which are generally used  for private parties. The atmosphere in the winter is apt to be rather  too sultry for English tastes, but it is perhaps less close than in most  other Dresden restaurants. At the back, there is an open space dignified  by the name of a garden, running down to a nice wide street, and here in  the summer a number of tables are laid, and one has the great advantage  of dining _al fresco_.    The attendance is well above the Dresden average and the waiters there  invariably clean and civil. The German waiter at his best is not often  one of the highest polished specimens of humanity, although some  compensation may be found in the almost paternal interest he takes in  _habitues_ or customers who have succeeded in winning his good graces.  The table linen and other appointments are up to the mark without being  luxurious.    In the middle of the day a huge dinner is served for 3s. By leaving out  one or two courses, you can get quite as much as you can eat for lunch,  and then you only have to pay 2s. This 2s. lunch is perhaps the  cheapest, and, at the price, the best meal of its kind that one could  possibly get at any restaurant. In its way, it is, I think, as  remarkable a performance as the 1s. 6d. Sunday morning breakfast at the  Grid at Oxford. It is, of course, not up to Chevillard or Paillard form,  but quite good enough for ordinary requirements. In the evening  everything is _a la carte_, and is almost as dear as the \"set\" meal in  the middle of the day is cheap. Single portions are, however, with some  very few exceptions, more than enough for two. The service is much more  _recherche_ than in the middle of the day; there is quite a large bill  of fare, and you can get all ordinary restaurant dishes, in addition to  a considerable selection of Delikatessen, such as oysters, caviar, fresh  truffles, peaches, etc., all of which are kept in good qualities.    Game and fish are also good at the Englischer Garten, and the partridges  and woodcocks are very well cooked; in fact, all their game can be  highly recommended. Live trout and other fresh-water fish are kept in a  tank, and you may generally rely on finding the soles and turbot fresh  as well. As regards price, unless you are an _habitue_ or make special  terms, a fairly little simple dinner will average out at 10s. a head,  exclusive of wine. It is well to order dinner beforehand, as the  culinary arrangements are not very expeditious. In the evening the  cuisine is by way of being first-class French art, but it just lacks the  lightness of touch which is characteristic of the best French cookery.    Wine is rather dear, but the higher-priced brands of hock, Moselle, or  claret are in some cases excellent. As to the champagnes found abroad,  unless they are specially made for the English market, they must not be  judged from an English standpoint, being as a rule far too sweet for our  taste.    An instance of this occurred to me at Rheims, when staying with one of  the champagne magnates for some shooting owned by a syndicate of some  of the large champagne shippers. We met for _dejeuner_ at their Chalet  de Chasse or club-house, each gentleman bringing his own wine. The  result was that one saw from ten to a dozen different famous brands of  champagne on the table.    My host asked me which sort I would prefer. \"Du vin Brut, if you have  any,\" I replied. \"Ah! Vous buvez de ce poison-la?\" exclaimed he,  smiling. So they evidently did not agree with our taste for dry wine.  But you can make a pleasant and harmless drink of the sweet champagne in  summer by mixing it with an equal quantity of light Moselle, adding a  liqueur glass of curacoa, and putting some wild strawberries or a large  peach cut up into the concoction with some ice.    To return to the Englischer Garten. They also keep some particularly  good Pilsen beer which they serve highly iced: that of course is as it  should be, but it is apt to have disastrous consequences if one is not  accustomed to it. Being a wine restaurant they do not expect you to  drink beer except as a supplement to your wine, but if you make a point  of it you can have it throughout. An additional charge of 6d. per head  is made for the set mid-day meal if wine is not ordered.    The _clientele_ is by way of being \"smart\" in the evening, and  there is generally a fair sprinkling of officers of the two  crack Saxon cavalry regiments,--the Dresden Horse Guards and  the Oschatz Lancers. Evening clothes, or, better still, a dress  jacket and a black tie are advisable, but by no means _de rigueur_.  The-cloth-cap knickerbocker-cum-Norfolk-jacket-get-up, unfortunately  so frequently affected by travelling Englishmen in continental  capitals, is certainly _not_ to be recommended.    In the middle of the day the company is more bourgeois, and on Sundays,  and occasionally on Saturdays, the place is apt to be unpleasantly  crowded. In the evening, except on race nights, there is always plenty  of room; in fact it is usually rather empty till after the plays are  over.    The other restaurants would not appeal to a gourmet but, for a change,  some of them are well worth visiting according to the season. For  instance:--    The Belvedere, an old-established and very popular institution,  delightfully situated on the Bruhlsche Terrasse, with a charming view  over the Elbe and the principal architectural features of the town.  Essentially a place for the summer, when one can take one's meals out of  doors on its terraces and balconies. There is a beer and a wine  department, and in the former an excellent band plays; but it is  difficult to secure a table within earshot as there is always a great  crowd. The attendance is indifferent and the cuisine fair and wholesome,  though no doubt you could get a good dinner if you took a little trouble  and ordered it.    The public dinners which take place there in the large banqueting hall  are quite creditable productions, and the position, view, and fresh air  all combine to render it a very pleasant hot-weather resort.    The Stadt Gotha. The wine restaurant is small and quaintly decorated.  Very popular with the upper and middle classes and _extremely_  respectable, cuisine very fair, set meals, and especially supper after  the play very inexpensive. But if you order _a la carte_, like most  other places, it is rather dear. A capital beer restaurant in connection  with it and good; a thoroughly plain German cooking served here.    Tiedemann and Grahl's, in the Seestrasse, is a typical German Weinstube  with a large _clientele_ of _habitues_, mostly men, but ladies can go  there. The owners being large wine merchants have some first-rate wine  at prices averaging rather lower than the Englischer Garten. But there  is a very extensive list and the quality is not altogether uniform,"]]]
