Tamen tanta universae Galliae consensio  fuit libertatis vindicandae et pristinae belli laudis recuperandae, ut  neque beneficiis neque amicitiae memoria moverentur, omnesque et animo  et opibus in id bellum incumberent. Coactis equitum VIII milibus et  peditum circiter CCL haec in Aeduorum finibus recensebantur, numerusque  inibatur, praefecti constituebantur. Commio Atrebati, Viridomaro et  Eporedorigi Aeduis, Vercassivellauno Arverno, consobrino  Vercingetorigis, summa imperi traditur. His delecti ex civitatibus  attribuuntur, quorum consilio bellum administraretur. Omnes alacres et  fiduciae pleni ad Alesiam proficiscuntur, neque erat omnium quisquam qui  aspectum modo tantae multitudinis sustineri posse arbitraretur,  praesertim ancipiti proelio, cum ex oppido eruptione pugnaretur, foris  tantae copiae equitatus peditatusque cernerentur.      77    At ei, qui Alesiae obsidebantur praeterita die, qua auxilia suorum  exspectaverant, consumpto omni frumento, inscii quid in Aeduis  gereretur, concilio coacto de exitu suarum fortunarum consultabant. Ac  variis dictis sententiis, quarum pars deditionem, pars, dum vires  suppeterent, eruptionem censebat, non praetereunda oratio Critognati  videtur propter eius singularem et nefariam crudelitatem. Hic summo in  Arvernis ortus loco et magnae habitus auctoritatis, \"Nihil,\" inquit, \"de  eorum sententia dicturus sum, qui turpissimam servitutem deditionis  nomine appellant, neque hos habendos civium loco neque ad concilium  adhibendos censeo. Cum his mihi res sit, qui eruptionem probant; quorum  in consilio omnium vestrum consensu pristinae residere virtutis memoria  videtur. Animi est ista mollitia, non virtus, paulisper inopiam ferre  non posse. Qui se ultro morti offerant facilius reperiuntur quam qui  dolorem patienter ferant. Atque ego hanc sententiam probarem (tantum  apud me dignitas potest), si nullam praeterquam vitae nostrae iacturam  fieri viderem: sed in consilio capiendo omnem Galliam respiciamus, quam  ad nostrum auxilium concitavimus. Quid hominum milibus LXXX uno loco  interfectis propinquis consanguineisque nostris animi fore existimatis,  si paene in ipsis cadaveribus proelio decertare cogentur? Nolite hos  vestro auxilio exspoliare, qui vestrae salutis causa suum periculum  neglexerunt, nec stultitia ac temeritate vestra aut animi imbecillitate  omnem Galliam prosternere et perpetuae servituti subicere. An, quod ad  diem non venerunt, de eorum fide constantiaque dubitatis? Quid ergo?  Romanos in illis ulterioribus munitionibus animine causa cotidie  exerceri putatis? Si illorum nuntiis confirmari non potestis omni aditu  praesaepto, his utimini testibus appropinquare eorum adventum; cuius rei  timore exterriti diem noctemque in opere versantur. Quid ergo mei  consili est? Facere, quod nostri maiores nequaquam pari bello Cimbrorum  Teutonumque fecerunt; qui in oppida compulsi ac simili inopia subacti  eorum corporibus qui aetate ad bellum inutiles videbantur vitam  toleraverunt neque se hostibus tradiderunt. Cuius rei si exemplum non  haberemus, tamen libertatis causa institui et posteris prodi  pulcherrimum iudicarem. Nam quid illi simile bello fuit? Depopulata  Gallia Cimbri magnaque illata calamitate finibus quidem nostris  aliquando excesserunt atque alias terras petierunt; iura, leges, agros,  libertatem nobis reliquerunt. Romani vero quid petunt aliud aut quid  volunt, nisi invidia adducti, quos fama nobiles potentesque bello  cognoverunt, horum in agris civitatibusque considere atque his aeternam  iniungere servitutem? Neque enim ulla alia condicione bella gesserunt.  Quod si ea quae in longinquis nationibus geruntur ignoratis, respicite  finitimam Galliam, quae in provinciam redacta iure et legibus commutatis  securibus subiecta perpetua premitur servitute.\"      78    Sententiis dictis constituunt ut ei qui valetudine aut aetate inutiles  sunt bello oppido excedant, atque omnia prius experiantur, quam ad  Critognati sententiam descendant: illo tamen potius utendum consilio, si  res cogat atque auxilia morentur, quam aut deditionis aut pacis  subeundam condicionem. Mandubii, qui eos oppido receperant, cum liberis  atque uxoribus exire coguntur. Hi, cum ad munitiones Romanorum  accessissent, flentes omnibus precibus orabant, ut se in servitutem  receptos cibo iuvarent. At Caesar dispositis in vallo custodibus recipi  prohibebat.      79    Interea Commius reliquique duces quibus summa imperi permissa erat cum  omnibus copiis ad Alesiam perveniunt et colle exteriore occupato non  longius mille passibus ab nostris munitionibus considunt. Postero die  equitatu ex castris educto omnem eam planitiem, quam in longitudinem  tria milia passuum patere demonstravimus, complent pedestresque copias  paulum ab eo loco abditas in locis superioribus constituunt. Erat ex  oppido Alesia despectus in campum. Concurrunt his auxiliis visis; fit  gratulatio inter eos, atque omnium animi ad laetitiam excitantur. Itaque  productis copiis ante oppidum considunt et proximam fossam cratibus  integunt atque aggere explent seque ad eruptionem atque omnes casus  comparant.      80    Caesar omni exercitu ad utramque partem munitionum disposito, ut, si  usus veniat, suum quisque locum teneat et noverit, equitatum ex castris  educi et proelium committi iubet. Erat ex omnibus castris, quae summum  undique iugum tenebant, despectus, atque omnes milites intenti pugnae  proventum exspectabant. Galli inter equites raros sagittarios  expeditosque levis armaturae interiecerant, qui suis cedentibus auxilio  succurrerent et nostrorum equitum impetus sustinerent. Ab his complures  de improviso vuluerati proelio excedebant. Cum suos pugna superiores  esse Galli confiderent et nostros multitudine premi viderent, ex omnibus  partibus et ei qui munitionibus continebantur et hi qui ad auxilium  convenerant clamore et ululatu suorum animos confirmabant. Quod in  conspectu omnium res gerebatur neque recte ac turpiter factum celari  poterat, utrosque et laudis cupiditas et timor ignominiae ad virtutem  excitabant. Cum a meridie prope ad solis occasum dubia victoria  pugnaretur, Germani una in parte confertis turmis in hostes impetum  fecerunt eosque propulerunt; quibus in fugam coniectis sagittarii  circumventi interfectique sunt. Item ex reliquis partibus nostri  cedentes usque ad castra insecuti sui colligendi facultatem non  dederunt. At ei qui ab Alesia processerant maesti prope victoria  desperata se in oppidum receperunt.      81    Vno die intermisso Galli atque hoc spatio magno cratium, scalarum,  harpagonum numero effecto media nocte silentio ex castris egressi ad  campestres munitiones accedunt. Subito clamore sublato, qua  significatione qui in oppido obsidebantur de suo adventu cognoscere  possent, crates proicere, fundis, sagittis, lapidibus nostros de vallo  proturbare reliquaque quae ad oppugnationem pertinent parant  administrare. Eodem tempore clamore exaudito dat tuba signum suis  Vercingetorix atque ex oppido educit. Nostri, ut superioribus diebus, ut  cuique erat locus attributus, ad munitiones accedunt; fundis librilibus  sudibusque quas in opere disposuerant ac glandibus Gallos proterrent.  Prospectu tenebris adempto multa utrimque vulnera accipiuntur. Complura  tormentis tela coniciuntur. At Marcus Antonius et Gaius Trebonius  legati, quibus hae partes ad defendendum obvenerant, qua ex parte  nostros premi intellexerant, his auxilio ex ulterioribus castellis  deductos summittebant.      82    Dum longius ab munitione aberant Galli, plus multitudine telorum  proficiebant; posteaquam propius successerunt, aut se stimulis  inopinantes induebant aut in scrobes delati transfodiebantur aut ex  vallo ac turribus traiecti pilis muralibus interibant. Multis undique  vulneribus acceptis nulla munitione perrupta, cum lux appeteret, veriti  ne ab latere aperto ex superioribus castris eruptione circumvenirentur,  se ad suos receperunt. At interiores, dum ea quae a Vercingetorige ad  eruptionem praeparata erant proferunt, priores fossas explent, diutius  in his rebus administrandis morati prius suos discessisse cognoverunt,  quam munitionibus appropinquarent. Ita re infecta in oppidum  reverterunt.      83    Bis magno cum detrimento repulsi Galli quid agant consulunt; locorum  peritos adhibent: ex his superiorum castrorum situs munitionesque  cognoscunt. Erat a septentrionibus collis, quem propter magnitudinem  circuitus opere circumplecti non potuerant nostri: necessario paene  iniquo loco et leniter declivi castra fecerunt. Haec Gaius Antistius  Reginus et Gaius Caninius Rebilus legati cum duabus legionibus  obtinebant. Cognitis per exploratores regionibus duces hostium LX milia  ex omni numero deligunt earum civitatum quae maximam virtutis opinionem  habebant; quid quoque pacto agi placeat occulte inter se constituunt;  adeundi tempus definiunt, cum meridies esse videatur. His copiis  Vercassivellaunum Arvernum, unum ex quattuor ducibus, propinquum  Vercingetorigis, praeficiunt. Ille ex castris prima vigilia egressus  prope confecto sub lucem itinere post montem se occultavit militesque ex  nocturno labore sese reficere iussit. Cum iam meridies appropinquare  videretur, ad ea castra quae supra demonstravimus contendit; eodemque  tempore equitatus ad campestres munitiones accedere et reliquae copiae  pro castris sese ostendere coeperunt.      84    Vercingetorix ex arce Alesiae suos conspicatus ex oppido egreditur;  crates, longurios, musculos, falces reliquaque quae eruptionis causa  paraverat profert. Pugnatur uno tempore omnibus locis, atque omnia  temptantur: quae minime visa pars firma est, huc concurritur. Romanorum  manus tantis munitionibus distinetur nec facile pluribus locis occurrit.

From her point of view it is utterly unreasonable,  inexcusable. What are hospitals and nurses for, anyway? And she is  carping, critical, and disagreeable. Her attitude is as sick as her  body. How could it be otherwise?    Look about you from an aching mind and body, after days of suffering and  sleeplessness, and unless you are a rare person and have a soul that  sees the sunshine back of everything--you will find the world a place of  torture. Look out from despair and loss of the ones you love best, or  from failure of will to meet disaster, and everybody may be involved in  bringing about your suffering, or in effecting your disgrace.    Look out on the world from the eyes of the immigrant who has lost all  his illusions of the land where dollars grow on the street and where  everyone has an equal chance to be president, and if you do not cringe  in abject humility, you are not unlikely to be insufferably  self-asserting, considering that the world has robbed you and that now  it is your turn to get all that is coming to you. So you make loud  demands in a rude, ordering voice. The nurse is there to wait upon  you--and finally you will have your innings.    Look out from the resentful eyes and smarting mind of the negro who is  just beginning in a northern city to realize that his boasted \"equality\"  is a farce, and you will try to prove to the white nurse that you are as  good as anybody. You are impossible; but back of all your bravado and  swagger and rudeness and complaint of neglect because of your color, you  realize that you cannot measure up. You know you belong to a different  race, most of whose members are daily giving evidences of inferiority;  and you are sure that the nurse is thinking that.    Look from the eyes of the \"new rich,\" or the very economical, and you  are going to get your money's worth out of your nurses.    The nurse who can get back of her patient's forehead and put her mind  there and let it work from the patient's point of view, will learn a  saving sense of humor, will be strict without antagonizing, will clear  away a lot of mental clouds and help to make permanent the cure the  treatment brings.    One can often judge very truly a patient's real character by his  reaction to his sickness. On the other hand, frequently it only  indicates that he has not yet properly adapted himself to a new  experience and a trying one. We hear so often, \"Why, she's a different  person these days, since she's feeling better. It's a joy to do things  for her.\" She was the same person a while back, but had not learned to  accept discomfort. Any of the following list of adjectives we hear  applied to our patient again and again by the nurses:      unreasonable     stubborn      lazy               deluded    cranky           resistive     unco-operative     will-less    hipped           obsessed      hypocritical       of mean disposition    excitable        fearful       exacting           dissatisfied    undecided        wilful        self-centered      morbid    doubtful         demanding     retarded           abusive    depressed        spineless     self-satisfied    Unpleasant terms they are, and condemning ones if accepted as final.  When the nurse realizes that under the same conditions she would  probably merit them herself, she becomes more anxious to remove the  conditions, and less bent upon blame.    We must admit that the highest type person, when sick of any physical  illness, does not deserve such descriptive terms as these. But they are  the rare folks, few and far between; while the great mass of us have not  acquired more than enough self-control and thoughtfulness for the  ordinary routine of life. We are weakly upset by the unexpected. If it  is a pleasant unexpected, we are plus in our enthusiasm, and people  applaud; if the unpleasant unexpected, we fall short, and people deplore  our weakness. If we learn our lesson of self-control and adaptability,  and gain in beauty of character through experience, it has served a  purpose. But the nurse deals with the average of human nature, and she  finds their reaction faulty. Very often, if she is observant, she will  discover that a patient responds in a very different way to some other  nurse, who somehow finds that \"trying\" sick woman charming or  thoughtful, likable or sweet. Of course, it may be because the other  nurse weakens discipline and caters to the patient's whims; but it is  just as likely to be because she has tempered her care and her  strictness with understanding. She has grasped the patient's point of  view; and with that start, the chances are 50 per cent. more in favor of  the patient grasping and acceding to the wise nurse's point of view.    Shall we not remember that our trying, cranky, stubborn patient is a  sick person, and learn to treat that stubbornness or crankiness as a  symptom indicating her need, just as we would a rising temperature?    When we can meet her attitude with comprehension, and, if necessary,  with quietly firm disregard, then we are beginning to be good nurses.    Some of the most common of these sick reactions with which the nurse  must deal are enhanced suggestibility, repression, oversensitiveness,  stubbornness, fear, depression, and irritability. And each one demands  a different method of approach if real help is to be given.    Old Isaac Walton wrote a book many, many years ago called \"The Complete  Angler.\" He was a famous amateur fisherman, and he says there are only  three rules to be observed and they will bring sure success:      1. Study your fish.    2. Study your fish.    3. Study your fish.    If the angler follows these directions, he is not apt to offer the wrong  bait. When he knows all their little peculiarities, he will know how to  catch his fish. The \"complete angler\" has an unlimited patience and an  infinite sense of repose and calm. He never hurries the fish, lest they  become suspicious of his bait. And he proves that these three rules  work.    The nurse who accepts every patient as like every other, and treats him  accordingly, will never be a great success. The nurse who \"studies her  fish\" and learns their psychology, will be a therapeutic force. She will  know the _why_ of the way that patient acts.      THE DELUDED PATIENT    If the patient's mind is temporarily clouded through infection or  suffering, he may be reacting to a delusion, an obsession, a fixed idea  of disability, a terrifying fear. Sometimes he persistently refuses  food, and gives no reason for it. The unthinking nurse is tried,  puzzled, and irritated. In other ways, perhaps, the patient seems quite  normal. But, after all, the explanation is very simple. He probably is  as confident that the food is poisoned as you are that it is as it  should be. No arguing would convince him, for, to his mind, the nurse is  either a complete dupe or an agent of the people whom he knows are  plotting his death. And urging him only strengthens his conviction.    The writer recalls one such case of a patient who had to be tube fed  through many months, though a tray was set before her three times a  day--and as regularly refused. Then one day she was seen slipping food  from off another patient's tray and eating it greedily, not knowing she  was observed. When questioned, though she had never before given a  reason for refusing food served to her, she said that \"they\" had nothing  against Mrs. B., so wouldn't try to poison her. Her reasoning was  excellent when one accepted her premises. She had bitter enemies. They  were not enemies of Mrs. B. and would not harm Mrs. B. Therefore she  dare not touch her own food, but could eat Mrs. B.'s if no one knew.    These deluded patients live in a world we often do not sense, a world  whose reality we do not appreciate. The nurse, after much experience,  finds that there is a key to every resistance, to every lack of  co-operation, to abnormal attitudes and actions. She realizes that a  powerful emotion of desire or fear, of love or hate, of ambition or  self-depreciation, of hope or despair, of faith or distrust, unchecked  by reason or judgment through the years, has provided a soil upon which  emotional thinking alone can grow. The patient is a mere puppet of the  suggestions of emotions which may not be at all pertinent to the facts.      NURSING THE DELUDED PATIENT    The nurse soon realizes the uselessness of attempting to argue a patient  out of his delusions, of trying to convince him that the things he sees  and hears and perhaps tastes and feels, are but hallucinations. Her very  insistence only fastens his attention more firmly upon the false  conclusion or makes him more convinced that his mind is giving him a  true report from the senses of sight and hearing and taste and feeling.  But often a quiet disregard of the delusions while the nurse goes on her  way and holds her patient to his routine, consistently and confidently,  as she would in case they were not true, will eventually cause him to  question their reality just because no calamity results. The nurse acts  as if these delusions and hallucinations were non-existent in reality,  and when the occasion arises, through the patient's questioning, she  urges him to exert his will to act also as if they were not true; to try  it and see what happens. Arguing, also, she finds, usually antagonizes  or makes the patient stubborn. He cannot prove by her logic his point,  but he \"knows\" from inner experience that he sees what he sees, hears  what he hears, and knows what he knows. The fact that the nurse does  not is merely annoying evidence that she is blind, deaf, or stupid to  these things of his reality. He knows he is lost and damned, or tainted;  that he is King George, Caesar, or the Lord, as the case may be; or that  his internal organs are all wrong. He \"feels\" it and the nurse  can't--therefore, he alone has true knowledge of it. In the end, the  wise nurse who never"]]]
