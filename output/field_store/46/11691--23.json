A step mounted the  stair slowly and steadily, and presently a hand was laid upon the knob,  and the lock clicked, and the door opened.    Fear held Markheim in a vice. What to expect he knew not--whether the  dead man walking, or the official ministers of human justice, or some  chance witness blindly stumbling in to consign him to the gallows. But  when a face was thrust into the aperture, glanced round the room,  looked at him, nodded and smiled as if in friendly recognition, and then  withdrew again, and the door closed behind it, his fear broke loose from  his control in a hoarse cry. At the sound of this the visitant returned.    \"Did you call me?\" he asked, pleasantly, and with that he entered the  room and closed the door behind him.    Markheim stood and gazed at him with all his eyes. Perhaps there was a  film upon his sight, but the outlines of the new comer seemed to change  and waver like those of the idols in the wavering candle-light of the  shop; and at times he thought he knew him; and at times he thought he  bore a likeness to himself; and always, like a lump of living terror,  there lay in his bosom the conviction that this thing was not of the  earth and not of God.    And yet the creature had a strange air of the commonplace, as he stood  looking on Markheim with a smile; and when he added, \"You are looking  for the money, I believe?\" it was in the tones of everyday politeness.    Markheim made no answer.    \"I should warn you,\" resumed the other, \"that the maid has left her  sweetheart earlier than usual and will soon be here. If Mr. Markheim be  found in this house, I need not describe to him the consequences.\"    \"You know me?\" cried the murderer.    The visitor smiled. \"You have long been a favourite of mine,\" he said;  \"and I have long observed and often sought to help you.\"    \"What are you?\" cried Markheim; \"the devil?\"    \"What I may be,\" returned the other, \"cannot affect the service I  propose to render you.\"    \"It can,\" cried Markheim; \"it does! Be helped by you? No, never; not by  you! You do not know me yet; thank God, you do not know me!\"    \"I know you,\" replied the visitant, with a sort of kind severity or  rather firmness. \"I know you to the soul.\"    \"Know me!\" cried Markheim. \"Who can do so? My life is but a travesty and  slander on myself. I have lived to belie my nature. All men do; all men  are better than this disguise that grows about and stifles them. You see  each dragged away by life, like one whom bravos have seized and muffled  in a cloak. If they had their own control--if you could see their faces,  they would be altogether different, they would shine out for heroes  and saints! I am worse than most; myself is more overlaid; my excuse is  known to me and God. But, had I the time, I could disclose myself.\"    \"To me?\" inquired the visitant.    \"To you before all,\" returned the murderer. \"I supposed you were  intelligent. I thought--since you exist--you would prove a reader of the  heart. And yet you would propose to judge me by my acts! Think of it--my  acts! I was born and I have lived in a land of giants; giants have  dragged me by the wrists since I was born out of my mother--the giants  of circumstance. And you would judge me by my acts! But can you not look  within? Can you not understand that evil is hateful to me? Can you not  see within me the clear writing of conscience, never blurred by any  wilful sophistry, although too often disregarded? Can you not read  me for a thing that surely must be common as humanity--the unwilling  sinner?\"    \"All this is very feelingly expressed,\" was the reply, \"but it regards  me not. These points of consistency are beyond my province, and I care  not in the least by what compulsion you may have been dragged away,  so as you are but carried in the right direction. But time flies; the  servant delays, looking in the faces of the crowd and at the pictures on  the hoardings, but still she keeps moving nearer; and remember, it is  as if the gallows itself was striding towards you through the Christmas  streets! Shall I help you--I, who know all? Shall I tell you where to  find the money?\"    \"For what price?\" asked Markheim.    \"I offer you the service for a Christmas gift,\" returned the other.    Markheim could not refrain from smiling with a kind of bitter triumph.  \"No,\" said he, \"I will take nothing at your hands; if I were dying of  thirst, and it was your hand that put the pitcher to my lips, I should  find the courage to refuse. It may be credulous, but I will do nothing  to commit myself to evil.\"    \"I have no objection to a death-bed repentance,\" observed the visitant.    \"Because you disbelieve their efficacy!\" Markheim cried.    \"I do not say so,\" returned the other; \"but I look on these things from  a different side, and when the life is done my interest falls. The man  has lived to serve me, to spread black looks under colour of religion,  or to sow tares in the wheat-field, as you do, in a course of weak  compliance with desire. Now that he draws so near to his deliverance, he  can add but one act of service: to repent, to die smiling, and thus  to build up in confidence and hope the more timorous of my surviving  followers. I am not so hard a master. Try me; accept my help. Please  yourself in life as you have done hitherto; please yourself more amply,  spread your elbows at the board; and when the night begins to fall and  the curtains to be drawn, I tell you, for your greater comfort, that you  will find it even easy to compound your quarrel with your conscience,  and to make a truckling peace with God. I came but now from such a  death-bed, and the room was full of sincere mourners, listening to the  man's last words; and when I looked into that face, which had been set  as a flint against mercy, I found it smiling with hope.\"    \"And do you, then, suppose me such a creature?\" asked Markheim. \"Do you  think I have no more generous aspirations than to sin and sin and sin  and at last sneak into heaven? My heart rises at the thought. Is this,  then, your experience of mankind? or is it because you find me with red  hands that you presume such baseness? And is this crime of murder indeed  so impious as to dry up the very springs of good?\"    \"Murder is to me no special category,\" replied the other. \"All sins  are murder, even as all life is war. I behold your race, like starving  mariners on a raft, plucking crusts out of the hands of famine and  feeding on each other's lives. I follow sins beyond the moment of their  acting; I find in all that the last consequence is death, and to my  eyes, the pretty maid who thwarts her mother with such taking graces on  a question of a ball, drips no less visibly with human gore than such  a murderer as yourself. Do I say that I follow sins? I follow virtues  also. They differ not by the thickness of a nail; they are both scythes  for the reaping angel of Death. Evil, for which I live, consists not  in action but in character. The bad man is dear to me, not the bad  act, whose fruits, if we could follow them far enough down the hurtling  cataract of the ages, might yet be found more blessed than those of  the rarest virtues. And it is not because you have killed a dealer, but  because you are Markheim, that I offer to forward your escape.\"    \"I will lay my heart open to you,\" answered Markheim. \"This crime  on which you find me is my last. On my way to it I have learned many  lessons; itself is a lesson--a momentous lesson. Hitherto I have been  driven with revolt to what I would not; I was a bond-slave to poverty,  driven and scourged. There are robust virtues that can stand in these  temptations; mine was not so; I had a thirst of pleasure. But to-day,  and out of this deed, I pluck both warning and riches--both the power  and a fresh resolve to be myself. I become in all things a free actor in  the world; I begin to see myself all changed, these hands the agents  of good, this heart at peace. Something comes over me out of the  past--something of what I have dreamed on Sabbath evenings to the sound  of the church organ, of what I forecast when I shed tears over noble  books, or talked, an innocent child, with my mother. There lies my  life; I have wandered a few years, but now I see once more my city of  destination.\"    \"You are to use this money on the Stock Exchange, I think?\" remarked  the visitor; \"and there, if I mistake not, you have already lost some  thousands?\"    \"Ah,\" said Markheim, \"but this time I have a sure thing.\"    \"This time, again, you will lose,\" replied the visitor quietly.    \"Ah, but I keep back the half!\" cried Markheim.    \"That also you will lose,\" said the other.    The sweat started upon Markheim's brow. \"Well then, what matter?\" he  exclaimed. \"Say it be lost, say I am plunged again in poverty, shall one  part of me, and that the worse, continue until the end to override the  better? Evil and good run strong in me, hailing me both ways. I do  not love the one thing; I love all. I can conceive great deeds,  renunciations, martyrdoms; and though I be fallen to such a crime as  murder, pity is no stranger to my thoughts. I pity the poor; who knows  their trials better than myself? I pity and help them. I prize love; I  love honest laughter; there is no good thing nor true thing on earth but  I love it from my heart. And are my vices only to direct my life, and my  virtues to lie without effect, like some passive lumber of the mind? Not  so; good, also, is a spring of acts.\"    But the visitant raised his finger. \"For six and thirty years that you  have been in this world,\" said he, \"through many changes of fortune and  varieties of humour, I have watched you steadily fall. Fifteen years  ago you would have started at a theft. Three years back you would have  blenched at the name of murder. Is there any crime, is there any cruelty  or meanness, from which you still recoil? Five years from now I shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#18)"],[1,"ily, I stand in no need of it. I have gained  Ghatgay over, and he will linger here until we hear that Balloba  has been arrested, and that Nana Furnuwees is approaching Poona.  Believe me, I shall never forget your offer, or the fidelity that  has prompted it; and when I am established as Peishwa you shall, if  it pleases you, have any post at court you may desire.\"    \"I thank you much, Prince; but I am an officer of Nana, and know  that, in acting as I have done, I am acting in his interest, as  well as yours. I am glad that the necessity for making an attack  upon the camp is obviated. I might have had considerable trouble in  raising a sufficient force for such a purpose, for even the most  reckless would hesitate to fall on one of Scindia's officers; and  in the next place, although I doubt not that I should have been  able to carry you off, Ghatgay would, as soon as he had beaten off  the attacking party, have set out in pursuit, and raised the whole  country, and the difficulty of reaching the Western Ghauts would  have been immense.    \"I hope to see Your Highness at Poona.\"    So saying, he strolled carelessly back to the bullock cart, waited  till the animals had finished their feed, and then drove off again;  returned the cart to its owner, and started again for Poona.    On his arrival there, he went to the Residency and informed Mr.  Malet that Bajee had gained over the officer who was escorting him,  and was ready to come back to Poona, as soon as the blow was  struck.    \"It will be struck soon,\" Mr. Malet said. \"All is in readiness. I  sent your report on to the Council, urging that, as it seemed  likely that Bajee Rao would soon be on the musnud, they should  express their readiness to recognize him. I received a despatch  only yesterday, saying that they perfectly agreed with me, and had  already sent off a messenger to Nana stating their willingness to  recognize Bajee as lawful heir to the late Peishwa.    \"Things are working well. The Nizam's general has been ordered to  watch Purseram Bhow, who is raising troops for the purpose of  aiding in crushing Bajee's supporters. Holkar and Scindia's troops  also are in readiness to move and, after the fete of the Dussera,  the regular battalions in the Peishwa's service, commanded by Mr.  Boyd, will march to the Neera bridge, and a brigade of Scindia's  regulars will move against Raygurh.    \"It is evident that neither Balloba nor Purseram has the slightest  suspicion of what is going on, or they would never have despatched  troops from here. I certainly have felt very uneasy, since Bajee  was carried away; for he is a necessary figure, and should be here  as soon as Nana arrives, otherwise there would be no recognized  head. It would have been hopeless to try to deliver him, once  imprisoned in one of the strong fortresses in Scindia's dominions;  and the latter could have made any terms for himself that he chose  to dictate.    \"Your news has relieved me of this anxiety, and I think it probable  that everything will now be managed without bloodshed; and that we  may, for a time, have peace here.\"    The next morning, Harry rode off and rejoined Nana, who thanked him  warmly for the manner in which he had carried out his mission, and  especially for his offer to attempt to rescue Bajee from his  captors.    \"It would have been the greatest misfortune,\" he said, \"had he been  carried far away. I should have been obliged to recognize his  brother Chimnajee; and Scindia, having Bajee in his hands, would  have kept up a constant pressure, and might probably have marched  to Poona to restore him; which he would certainly have succeeded in  doing, for the feeling of the population would have been all in  favour of the lawful heir.    \"As a token of my satisfaction, here is an order upon my treasurer  for fifty thousand rupees.\"    All being ready, Scindia, on the 27th of October, suddenly arrested  Balloba; and sent a body of his troops, with those of the Nizam's  general, for the purpose of seizing Purseram Bhow. The latter,  receiving news of what had happened in good time, and taking with  him Chimnajee, fled to a fortress; but was quickly pursued, and  obliged to surrender. Bajee Rao was brought back to Beema, eighteen  miles from Poona. His brother Amrud, and Rao Phurkay, were also  released.    Nana joined his army at the Salpee Ghaut, and Scindia's infantry,  under Mr. Boyd, marched for the capital; which Nana refused to  enter, however, until he had received a formal declaration, from  Bajee, that he intended no treachery against him. This pledge was  given; and a treaty was, at the same time, entered into by the  Nizam and Scindia, both agreeing to establish Bajee Rao on the  musnud, and reinstate Nana as his prime minister. These matters  being settled, Nana returned to Poona, from which he had been  absent for nearly a year, and resumed the duties of prime minister.    A fortnight later, Bajee Rao was solemnly invested as Peishwa. One  of his first acts was to send for Harry, to whom he gave a robe of  honour, and thirty thousand rupees in money, in token of his  gratitude for the risk he had run in communicating with him, and  for his daring proposal to rescue him from the hands of his escort.    On the day after Nana's re-entry into the capital, Harry received a  note from Mr. Malet, asking him to call.    \"I expect Colonel Palmer to relieve me of my duties here, in the  course of a day or two. I need scarcely say I shall be glad to be  released from a work which is surrounded with infinite difficulty,  and which constantly upsets all human calculations. Nana is in  power again; but another turn of the wheel may take place, at any  moment, and he may again be an exile, or possibly a prisoner.    \"It seems to me that it would be well for you to accompany me to  Bombay. The remembrance of your services will be fresh, and they  cannot but be recognized by the Council. That body is frequently  changed and, in two or three years' time, there will be fresh men,  who will know nothing of what has happened now, and be indisposed  to rake up old reports and letters, or to reward past services;  especially as the whole position here may have altered, half a  dozen times, before that.\"    \"I will gladly do so, sir, and thank you very heartily for your  kindness. I will ride over to Jooneer, tomorrow, and bring my old  nurse down with me; and I have no doubt Sufder will be willing to  accompany us. He has rendered good services to Nana; and the latter  will, I am sure, grant him leave of absence for as long as may be  necessary.\"    \"I think it would certainly be best to take them both down, if  possible. They could make affidavits, in Bombay, that would place  it beyond doubt that you are Major Lindsay's son. It is morally  certain that there are relatives of your father and mother still  living, in England. I do not say that you require any assistance  from them; but when you return home, as everyone does, two or three  times, in the course of his Indian service, it would be pleasant to  find friends there; and it would be well that your position should  be established beyond all question.\"    \"I will gladly go down with you,\" Soyera said, when Harry laid the  matter before her. \"I am happy and contented here, but should be glad  to see Bombay again. It was my home for ten years. I am very glad you  have made up your mind to go, for it is time that you should take your  place among your countrymen; and the recommendation of the Resident  at the court of Poona is as good a one as you could wish for.    \"I should say that you had better give up, at once, staining your  skin. I can see that you have not used the dye for some days, and  it would be as well to recover your proper colour, before Mr. Malet  introduces you to the Council at Bombay.\"    \"I will ride down to the town,\" Harry said, \"and engage a gharry [a  native carriage] to carry you to Poona. When we get there, I shall  learn what route Mr. Malet will take, and how fast he will travel;  and shall then see which will be the best for you--to go down in a  gharry, or to be carried in a dhoolie [a palanquin].\"    \"But all this will cost money, Harry.\"    \"I am well provided with funds,\" Harry said, \"for the Nana and  Bajee Rao have both made me handsome presents for the services I  rendered them. There is, therefore, no reason why we should not  travel in comfort.\"    They arrived at Poona two days later; and Harry--having ascertained  that the new Resident would not arrive until the next day, and that  he would probably wish Mr. Malet to defer his departure for at  least two days, in order to give him his experience of the factions  and intrigues there, and of the character of all those who were  likely to influence events--rode to see Nana, who had not yet  returned to Poona.    \"I have come, your excellency,\" he said, \"to tell you that it is my  wish to retire from the public service.\"    The minister looked greatly surprised.    \"Why, Puntojee,\" he said, \"this sounds like madness. Young as you  are, you have secured powerful protectors, both in the Peishwa and  myself; and you may hope to reach a high office in the state, as  you grow older.    \"I do not know, though,\" he went on, speaking to himself rather  than to the lad, \"that high office is a thing to be desired. It  means being mixed up in intrigues of all kinds, being the object of  jealousy and hatred, and running a terrible risk of ruin at every  change in the government here.\"    Then he turned again to Harry.    \"And what are you thinking of doing?\"    \"I will speak frankly to your highness. I am not a Mahratta, as you  and everyone else suppose. I am the son of English parents.\"    And he then went on to give an account of the killing of his father  and mother, and of how he was saved by Soyera, and brought up as  her son; until such times as he might, with advantage, go down to  Bombay. Nana listened with great interest.    \""]]]
