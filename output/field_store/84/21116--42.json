Jove laugh'd, and threw them down a log,  That thundering fell and shook the bog.  Amongst the reeds the tremblers fled:  Till one more bold advanc'd his head,  And saw the monarch of the flood  Lying half smothered in the mud.  He calls the croaking race around:  \"A wooden king!\" the banks resound.  Fear once remov'd they swim about him,  And gibe and jeer and mock and flout him;  And messengers to Jove depute,  Effectively to grant their suit.  A hungry stork he sent them then,  Who soon had swallow'd half the fen.  Their woes scarce daring to reveal,  To Mercury by night they steal,  And beg him to entreat of Jove  The direful tyrant to remove.  'No,' says the God, 'they chose their lot,  And must abide what they have got:'  So you, my friends, had best go home  In peace, lest something worse should come.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE HARE AND THE BRAMBLE.      A hare, closely pursued, thought it prudent and meet  To a bramble for refuge awhile to retreat;  He enter'd the covert, but entering, found  That briers and thorns did on all sides abound;  And that, though he was safe, yet he never could stir,  But his sides they would wound, or would tear off his fur:  He shrugg'd up his shoulders, but would not complain:  \"To repine at small evils,\" quoth puss, \"is in vain:  That no bliss can be perfect, I very well knew--  But from the same source good and evil doth flow--  And full sorely my skin though these briers may rend,  Yet they keep off the dogs, and my life will defend:  For the sake of the good, then, let evil be borne--  For each sweet has its bitter, each bramble its thorn.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE HORSE AND THE STAG.      Within a certain pasture,    There lived some creatures wild.  The sky was blue, the grass was green,    The air was very mild.    Now though this field was large and fine,    They could not live in love:  But for the grass in one large spot    A horse and stag once strove.    The stag was strongest in the strife,    And so the battle won;  And from the field the horse was sent    And with chagrin was stung.    So to the man the horse applied,    For help, the stag to beat,  And so effectual was his help,    The stag had to retreat.    But when to go away he tried,    The man held to him fast:  \"Now that you are of use,\" he cried,    \"You'll serve me to the last.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE CAT AND THE OLD MOUSE.      The mice o'errun a certain house--  In every spot was found a mouse.  So for a cat the mistress went,  And to the kitchen puss was sent.    With diligence were many caught,  And eaten up. The mice were taught  That they some cunning must devise  To keep the prey from pussy's eyes.    So on a certain shelf so high,  To reach which puss in vain might try,  There all the mice together got,  And they resolved to leave it not.    So pussy found that to eat them,  She must resort to stratagem.  And holding fast by means of pegs,  She hung suspended by the legs.    And downward she then hung her head,  And looked as though she were quite dead--  And thus she sought to cheat the mice,  And from their dwellings them entice.    A cunning mouse, well \"up to trap,\"  On pussy her two eyes did clap.  \"Aha!\" she cried, \"puss are you there?  Within your reach, I would not dare--  Not e'en though it were proved by law,  That your whole skin were stuffed with straw.\"          [Illustration]    THE FOX AND THE VIZOR MASK.      A fox while walking out one day,  Into a toy shop chanced to stray;  Among the toys that stood arrayed,  A vizor mask was there displayed,  With rosy cheeks, complexion fair,  And ruby lips and auburn hair,  And eyes of blue, and Grecian nose;  And many beauties to disclose,  It seemed made. The fox, with sighs,  Gazed on. \"Ah, ah!\" he cries,  \"Look at this head it naught contains,  It has rare beauty, but no brains.\"      MORAL.    The accomplished beau, in air and mien how blest.  His hat well fashioned, and his hair well dress'd--  But still undress'd within: to give him brains  Exceeds his hatter's or his barber's pains.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE GOOSE THAT LAID GOLDEN  EGGS.      A man once had a goose I'm told,  Which had laid each day an egg of gold.  Now if this treasure were well spent,  It might make any one content.  But no! this man desired more;  And though of eggs he had rich store;  He thought one day the goose he'd kill,  And then at once his pockets fill.  So chasing goosey round and round,  She soon was caught and firmly bound  He opened her from neck to tail  And then his folly did bewail.  For not a single egg was there,  And thus he lost this treasure rare.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FOX AND THE GRAPES.      A fox once took it in his pate,  To go beyond a garden gate,  To see if there grew on the trees,  Some food his hunger to appease.  So in he went and there he spied  Some grapes. To reach them hard he tried.  Now they were large and luscious too,  Quite purple, and beautiful to view.  So up he jumps with many a bound,  Until exhausted to the ground,  He falls. The grapes hang o'er his head,  In clusters large, \"Well! well!\" he said,  \"You are but green, and hard as stone,  And all my time away is thrown.  I'll leave you to your solitude,  You are not fit to make me food.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE MOUSE AND THE WEASEL.      A very thin and hungry mouse,    Into a granary stole,  Where stood a basket full of grain,    In which was a small hole.    After much squeezing he got in,    And there he ate his fill;  But when he tried to issue out,    The hole seemed smaller still.    A weasel who stood looking on,    Cried out in sneering tone,  \"You can't come out, my little dear,    Until you've smaller grown.    \"You were half-starved when you crept in,    And now you are quite stout;  So cease to eat until you can,    As you got in, get out.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE MISER AND HIS TREASURE.        In a retired spot,    A miser had got  A very large treasure in store.    And it was his delight,    Each morn and each night,  To count it and add to it more.      He had made the hole deep,    And he thought none would peep,  To find out his secret retreat.    But a servant so sly,    His master did spy,  And thought that his cunning he'd beat.      So one dark winter night,    He took out his light,  And to the field hastened away;    And he laughed in his sleeve,    To think how 'twould grieve  His master to miss it next day.      And indeed the distress    Of his lord you may guess,  For words can't describe it, I'm sure.    He tore out his hair,    Clasp'd his hands in despair  And cried he was ruined and poor.      A man passing by,    His grief chanced to spy;  And told him, \"'tis useless to mourn.    You can look at the hole,    To solace your soul,  Although all the money is gone.\"          [Illustration]    THE JACKDAW AND THE PEACOCKS.      Thus Esop has the folly shown,  To build on merits not your own.    A jackdaw, empty, pert and vain,  Who held his equals in disdain,  One day some beauteous feathers found,  Left by a peacock on the ground.  When in the gaudy plumage dress'd,  The shallow thing his fortune bless'd;  With stately gesture strode along,  And boldly join'd the peacock throng;  Who, his impertinence to pay,  First stripp'd him, and then chas'd away.  The crest-fall'n coxcomb homeward sneaks,  And his forsaken comrades seeks;  Where'er he comes, with scorn they leave him,  And not a jackdaw will receive him.  Says one he had disdain'd, at last,  \"Such as thou art, thou mightst have pass'd,  And hadst not now been cast behind,  The scorn and scandal of thy kind.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SPARROW AND THE HARE.      Who dares another's ills deride,  Had best against his own provide.  An eagle pouncing on a hare,  With piercing cries puss rends the air;  When a pert sparrow from a tree,  Insulted thus her misery:  \"Ho, ho! poor puss, thy boasted speed  Has failed thee, then, in time of need!\"  Scarce had she spoke, when, like an arrow,  A vulture darted on the sparrow.  Ere the poor hare resign'd her breath,  \"This sight,\" she cried, \"consoles in death  --That thou, who hast my woes derided,  My last of miseries hast divided!\"          [Illustration]    THE ASS AND THE LION.      Vain boasters credit may surprise,  Till known; who knows them will despise.    A lion once a hunting took  An ass, and hid him in a nook.  To drive the forest made him bray,  That he might seize the passing prey.  Long-ears set up such horrid cries,  That every creature trembling flies;  The lion, practised in his trade,  Had soon abundant carnage made;  Satiate with spoil, the ass he calls,  And bid him cease his hideous brawls.  The king he found with slaughter weary,  Surrounded by his noble quarry,  And, puffed with self-importance, said:  \"Sir, to some purpose I have bray'd!\"  \"No ass more famously could do,\"  The lion says, \"but thee I knew,  Or I might have been frightened too.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE STAG AND THE FOUNTAIN.      That good from bad men rarely know,  This apologue may serve to show:    A stag upon a fountain's side,  Beheld his branching horns with pride;  While of his spindle-shanks asham'd,  Their disproportioned form he blam'd.  Sudden he hears the hunter's cries,  And to the forest nimbly flies.  The woods receive their well-known guest.  His tangled horns, his feet arrest;  The hounds approach, and seize their prey;  Who, dying, thus was heard to say:  \"Wretch that I am! too late I learn,  How little we the truth discern!  What would have saved me, I despis'd,  And what has been my ruin, priz'd!\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE  SOW.

Nor was it in his  nature to conceal his feelings. Speaking early in the year in defence of  his former colleague, C. Antonius, accused of _maiestas_ for his conduct  in Macedonia, he expressed in no doubtful terms his view of the  political situation. Within a few hours the words were reported to the  triumvirs, and all formalities were promptly gone through for the  adoption of Clodius. Caesar himself presided at the _comitia curiata_,  Pompey attended as augur, and the thing was done in a few minutes. Even  then Cicero does not appear to have been alarmed, or to have been fully  aware of what the object of Publius was. While on his usual spring visit  to his seaside villas in April (B.C. 59), he expressed surprise at  hearing from the young Curio that Clodius was a candidate for the  tribuneship (vol. i., p. 99). His surprise no doubt was more or less  assumed: he must have understood that Clodius's object in the adoption  was the tribunate, and must have had many uneasy reflexions as to the  use which he would make of the office when he got it. Indeed there was  not very much doubt about it, for Publius openly avowed his intentions.  We have accordingly numerous references, in the letters to Atticus, to  Cicero's doubts about the course he ought to adopt. Should he accept  Caesar's offer of a legation in Gaul, or a free and votive legation?  Should he stay in Rome and fight it out? The latter course was the one  on which he was still resolved in July, when Clodius had been, or was on  the point of being, elected tribune (p. 110). He afterwards wavered (p.  113), but was encouraged by the belief that all the \"orders\" were  favourable to him, and were becoming alienated from the triumvirs (pp.  117, 119), especially after the affair of Vettius (pp. 122-124), and by  the friendly disposition of many of the colleagues of Clodius in the  tribuneship. With such feelings of confidence and courage the letters of  B.C. 59 come to an end.    [Sidenote: The Exile, April, B.C. 58--August, B.C. 57.]    The correspondence only opens again in April of B.C. 58, when the worst  has happened. Clodius entered upon his tribuneship on the 10th of  December, B.C. 59, and lost little time in proposing a law to the  _comitia_ for the trial of any magistrate guilty of putting citizens to  death without trial (_qui cives indemnatos necavisset_). The wording of  the law thus left it open to plead that it applied only to such act as  occurred after its enactment, for the pluperfect _necavisset_ in the  dependent clause answers to the future perfect in a direct one. And this  was the interpretation that Caesar, while approving the law itself,  desired to put upon it.[8] He again offered Cicero a legation in Gaul,  but would do nothing for him if he stayed in Rome; while Pompey, who had  been profuse in promises of protection, either avoided seeing Cicero, or  treated his abject entreaties with cold disdain.[9] Every citizen, by a  humane custom at Rome, had the right of avoiding a prosecution by  quitting the city and residing in some town which had the _ius exilii_.  It is this course that we find Cicero already entered upon when the  correspondence of the year begins. In the letters of this year of exile  he continually reproaches himself with not having stayed and even  supported the law, in full confidence that it could not be applied to  himself. He attributes his having taken the less courageous course to  the advice of his friends, who were actuated by jealousy and a desire  to get rid of him. Even Atticus he thinks was timid, at the best, in  advising his retirement. It is the only occasion in all the  correspondence in which the least cloud seems to have rested on the  perfect friendship of the two men. Atticus does not appear to have shewn  any annoyance at the querulous remarks of his friend. He steadily  continued to write, giving information and advice, and made no  difficulty in supplying his friend with money. During Cicero's absence  Atticus became still more wealthy than before by inheriting the estates  of his cross-grained uncle Caecilius. But he was always careful as to the  investment of his money and he would not, perhaps, have been so ready to  trust Cicero, had he not felt confidence in the ultimate recovery of his  civil status. Still his confidence was peculiarly welcome at a time  which would have been otherwise one of great pressure. For Clodius had  followed up Cicero's retirement with the usual _lex_ in regard to  persons leaving Rome to avoid a trial--a prohibition \"of fire and water\"  within a fixed distance from Italy, which involved the confiscation of  all his property in Italy. His villas were dismantled, his town house  pulled down, and a vote of the people obtained by Clodius for the  consecration of its site as a _templum_ dedicated to Liberty, and a  scheme was formed and the work actually commenced for occupying part of  it by an extension of an existing porticus or colonnade (the _porticus  Catuli_) to contain a statue of Liberty. That this consecration was  regular is shewn by the pleas by which it was afterwards sought to  reverse it.[10] When Cicero was recalled the question came before the  pontifices, who decided that the consecration was not valid unless it  had been done by the \"order of the people.\" It could not be denied on  the face of it that there had been such an order. Cicero was obliged to  resort to the plea that Clodius's adoption had been irregular and  invalid, that therefore he was not legally a tribune, and could not take  an order of the people. Finally, the senate seems to have decided that  its restoration to Cicero was part of the general _restitutio in  integrum_ voted by the _comitia centuriata_; and a sum of money was  assigned to him for the rebuilding of the house. Clodius refused to  recognize the validity of this decree of the senate, and attempted by  violence to interrupt the workmen engaged on the house. We have a lively  picture of this in Letter XCI (vol. i., pp. 194-196).    [Sidenote: Letters of the Exile (Letters LV-LXXXVIII).]    The letters from Cicero as an exile are painful reading for those who  entertain a regard for his character. It was not unnatural, indeed, that  he should feel it grievously. He had so completely convinced himself of  the extraordinary value of his services to the state, of the importance  of his position in Roman politics, and of the view that the Optimates  would take of the necessity of retaining him, that to see himself  treated like a fraudulent or unsuccessful provincial governor, of no  importance to anyone but himself, was a bitter blow to his self-esteem.  The actual loss was immense. His only means were now the amount of money  he had been able to take with him, or was able to borrow. All was gone  except such property as his wife retained in her own right. He was a  dependent upon her, instead of being her support and the master of his  own household. The services of freedmen--readily rendered when he was  prosperous--would now be a matter of favour and personal attachment,  which was not always sufficient to retain them. The \"life and light\" of  the city, in which no man ever took a more eager interest and delight,  were closed to him. He was cut off from his family, and from familiar  intercourse with friends, on both of which he was much dependent for  personal happiness. Lastly, wherever he lived, he lived, as it were, on  sufferance, no longer an object of respect as a statesman, or the source  of help to others by his eloquence. But, disagreeable as all this was to  a man of Cicero's sensitive vanity, there was something still worse.  Even in towns which were the legal distance from Italy he could not  safely stay, if they were within the jurisdiction of one of his personal  enemies, or contained other exiles, who owed him an ill turn. He was  protected by no law, and more than one instance of such a man's falling  a victim to an enemy's dagger is recorded. Cicero's first idea was to go  to Malta: but Malta was for some purposes in the jurisdiction of the  governor of Sicily, and the governor of Sicily (C. Vergilius[11])  objected to his passing through Sicily or staying at Malta. We have no  reason for supposing Vergilius personally hostile to Cicero, but he may  have thought that Cicero's services to the Sicilians in the case of  Verres would have called out some expression of feeling on their part in  his favour, which would have been awkward for a Roman governor. Cicero  therefore crossed to Epirus, and travelled down the Egnatian road to  Thessalonica. This was the official capital of the province of  Macedonia, and the quaestor in Macedonia, Gnaeus Plancius, met Cicero at  Dyrrachium, invited him to fix his residence there with him, and  accompanied him on his journey. Here he stayed till November in a state  of anxiety and distress, faithfully reflected in his letters, waiting to  hear how far the elections for B.C. 57 would result in putting his  friends in office, and watching for any political changes that would  favour his recall: but prepared to go still farther to Cyzicus, if the  incoming governor, L. Calpurnius Piso, who, as consul in B.C. 58 with  Gabinius, had shewn decided animus against him, should still retain that  feeling in Macedonia. Events, however, in Rome during the summer and  autumn of B.C. 58 gave him better hopes. Clodius, by his violent  proceedings, as well as by his legislation, had alienated Pompey, and  caused him to favour Cicero's recall. Of the new consuls Lentulus was  his friend, and Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos (who as tribune in B.C. 63-62  had prevented his speech when laying down his"]]]
