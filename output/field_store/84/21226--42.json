If Miss Merton had dealt her a blow on  her upturned face, it could have hurt no more severely than had this  unlooked-for reprimand. She was filled with a choking sense of shame  that threatened to end in a burst of angry sobs. The deep blush that had  risen to her face receded, leaving her very white. Those students  sitting in her immediate vicinity had, of course, heard Miss Merton. She  glanced quickly about to encounter two pairs of eyes. One pair was blue  and, it seemed to the embarrassed newcomer, sympathetic. Their owner was  the \"Mary\" girl, who sat two seats behind her in the next aisle. The  other pair was cruelly mocking, and they belonged to the girl that  Marjorie had mentally styled the Evil Genius. Something in their  taunting depths stirred an hitherto unawakened chord in gentle Marjorie  Dean. She returned the insolent gaze with one so full of steady strength  and defiance that the girl's eyes dropped before it and she devoted  herself assiduously to the open book which she held in her hand.    \"Don't mind Miss Merton,\" whispered Muriel, comfortingly. \"She is the  worst crank I ever saw. No one likes her. I don't believe even Miss  Archer does. She's been here for ages, so the Board of Education thinks  that Sanford High can't run without her, I guess.\"    \"I'm so mortified and ashamed,\" murmured Marjorie. \"On my first day,  too.\"    \"Don't think about it,\" soothed Muriel. \"What studies are you going to  take? I hope you will recite in some of my classes. Wait a moment. I'll  come back there and sit with you; then we'll make less noise. Miss  Merton told me to help you, you know,\" she reminded, with a soft  chuckle.    The fair head and the dark one bent earnestly over the printed sheet.  Marjorie whispered her list of subjects to her new friend, who jotted  them down on the margin of the program.    \"How about 9.15 English Comp?\" she asked. \"That's my section.\"    Marjorie nodded her approval.    \"Then you can recite algebra with me at 10.05, and there's a first-year  French class at 11.10. That brings three subjects in the morning. Now,  let me see about your history. If you can make your history and  physiology come the first two periods in the afternoon, you will be  through by three o'clock and can have that last half hour for study or  gym, or whatever you like. I am carrying only four subjects, so I have  nothing but physical geography in the afternoon. I am through reciting  every day by 2 o'clock, so I learn most of my lessons in school and  hardly ever take my books home. If I were you, I'd drop one  subject--American History, for instance. You can study it later. The  freshman class is planning a lot of good times for this winter, and, of  course, you want to be in them, too, don't you?\"    \"I should say so,\" beamed Marjorie. \"Still,\" her face sobering, \"I think  I won't drop history. It's easy, and I love it.\"    \"Well, I don't,\" emphasized Muriel. \"By the way, do you play  basketball?\"    \"I played left guard on our team last year, and I had just been chosen  for center on the freshman team, at Franklin High, when I left there,\"  was the whispered reply.    \"That's encouraging,\" declared Muriel. \"We haven't chosen our team yet.  We are to have a tryout at four o'clock on Friday afternoon in the  gymnasium. You can go to the meeting with me, although you will have met  most of the freshman class before Friday. Oh, yes, did Miss Archer tell  you that we report in the study hall at half-past eight o'clock on  Monday and Friday mornings? We have chapel exercises, and woe be unto  you if you are late. It's an unforgivable offense in Miss Merton's eyes  to walk into chapel after the service has begun. If you are late, you  take particular pains to linger around the corridor until the line  comes out of chapel, then you slide into your section and march into the  study hall as boldly as though you'd never been late in your life,\"  ended Muriel with a giggle, which she promptly smothered.    \"But what if Miss Merton sees one?\"    Muriel made a little resigned gesture. \"Try it some day and see. There's  the 9.15 bell. Come along. If we hurry we'll have a minute with the  girls before class begins. All of my chums recite English this first  hour. You needn't stop at Miss Merton's desk. It'll be all right.\"    Marjorie walked down the aisle behind Muriel, looking rather worried.  Then she touched Muriel's arm. \"I think I'd rather stop and speak to  Miss Merton,\" she said with soft decision.    \"All right,\" the response came indifferently as Muriel, a bored look on  her youthful face, walked on ahead.    Marjorie walked bravely up to the teacher. \"Miss Merton, I have arranged  my studies and recitation hours. Miss Harding is going to show me the  way to the English composition class.\"    Miss Merton stared coldly at the girl's vivid, colorless face, framed in  its soft brown curls. Her own youth had been prim and narrow, and she  felt that she almost hated this girl whose expressive features gave  promise of remarkable personality and abundant joy of living.    \"Very well.\" The disagreeable note of dismissal in the teacher's voice  angered Marjorie.    \"I'll never again speak to her unless it's positively necessary,\" she  resolved resentfully. \"I wish I'd taken Miss Harding's advice.\"    \"Well, did she snap your head off?\" inquired Muriel as Marjorie joined  her.    \"No,\" was the brief answer.    \"It's a wonder. There goes the third bell. It's on to English comp for  us. I won't have time to introduce you to the girls. We'll have to wait  until noon. Miss Flint teaches English. She's a dear, and everyone likes  her.\"    Muriel's voice dropped on her last speech, for they were now entering  the classroom. At the first flat-topped desk in one corner of the room  sat a small, fair woman with a sweet, sunshiny face that quite won  Marjorie to her.    \"Miss Flint, this is Miss Dean,\" began Muriel, as they stopped before  the desk. \"She is a freshman and has just been registered in the study  hall by Miss Merton.\"    A long, earnest glance passed between teacher and pupil, then Marjorie  felt her hand taken between two small, warm palms. \"I am sure Miss Dean  and I are going to be friends,\" said a sweet, reassuring voice that  amply made up for Miss Merton's stiffness. \"Are you a stranger in  Sanford, my dear? I am sure I have never seen you before.\"    \"We have lived here a week,\" smiled Marjorie. \"We moved here from  B----.\"    \"How interesting. Were you a student of Franklin High School? I have a  dear friend who teaches English there.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Marjorie, her eyes sparkling, \"do you mean Miss  Fielding?\"    \"Yes,\" returned Miss Flint. \"We were best friends during our college  days, too. Hampton College is our alma mater.\"    \"That is where I hope to go when I finish high school. Miss Fielding has  told me so many nice things about Hampton,\" was Marjorie's eager reply.  Then she added impetuously, \"I'm going to like Sanford, too. I'm quite  sure of it.\"    \"That is the right spirit in which to begin your work here,\" was the  instant response. \"I will assign you to that last seat in the third row.  We do not change seats. Each girl is given her own place for the year.\"    Marjorie thanked Miss Flint, and made her way to the seat indicated. The  sound of footsteps in the corridor had ceased. A tall girl in the front  row of desks slipped from her seat and closed the door. Miss Flint rose,  faced her class, and the recitation began.    After the class was dismissed Miss Flint detained Marjorie for a moment  to ask a few questions regarding her text and note books. Muriel waited  in the corridor. Her face wore an expression of extreme satisfaction.  It looked as though the new freshman might be a distinct addition to the  critical little company of girls who had set themselves as rulers and  arbiters of the freshman class. She was pretty, wore lovely clothes,  lived in a big house in a select neighborhood, had played center on a  city basketball team, and was the friend of Miss Flint's friend. To be  sure, Mignon La Salle might raise some objection to the newcomer. Mignon  was so unreasonably jealous. But for all her money, Mignon must not be  allowed always to have her own way. Muriel was sure the rest of the  girls would be quite in favor of adding Marjorie Dean to their number.  They needed one more girl to complete their sextette. To Marjorie should  fall the honor.    \"I'll introduce her to the girls this noon, and let them look her over.  Then I'll have a talk with them to-night and see what they think,\"  planned Muriel as she went back to the study hall at Marjorie's side.    There was a hurried exchange of books, then Marjorie was rushed off to  her algebra recitation. Here she found herself at least two weeks ahead  of the others, and was able to solve a problem at the blackboard that  had puzzled several members of the class, thereby winning a reputation  for herself as a mathematician to which it afterward proved anything but  easy to live up to.    While in both her English and algebra classes Marjorie had searched the  room with alert eyes for the girl who looked like Mary. She felt vaguely  disappointed. She had hoped to come into closer contact with her. She  liked Muriel, she decided, but she did not altogether understand her  half-cordial, half-joking manner. She was rather glad that she was to go  to her French class alone. She had told Muriel not to bother. She could  find the classroom by herself.    As she clicked down the short, left-hand, third floor corridor, she saw  just ahead of her a little blue-clad figure passing through the very  doorway for which she was making. An instant and she too had entered the  room. She stared about her, then walked to a seat directly opposite to  the one now occupied by the girl that looked like Mary. For a brief  moment the girl eyed Marjorie indifferently, then something in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#6)"],[1,"eyes. Their shouts announced their arrival to the  people of the city, who hurried to street corners and to market places,  and saw with curious and astonished eyes the strangest of all armies  which had ever visited their city before, and young and old listened  with wide-eyed astonishment to the tale they told. Three hundred miles  they had come, those children, in about a month, and the sea was now to  divide that they might pass over in safety to accomplish their holy  object!    Unlike the German army, their numbers were scarcely lessened, as many  new recruits had joined the ranks and replaced those few who had  deserted or fallen by the way-side. So it was not a small and tattered  or worn-out band who made their appeal to the Marseillian authorities,  but an imposing band of twenty thousand youths, still flushed with  health and hope.    Having no political reason to refuse them entrance to the city, and  possibly rejoicing to have such an influx of pilgrims, permission to  stay was given to the host of youths, who with their leader and the  older companions who had followed the army, accepted the hospitality of  Marseilles and were housed in various places for the one night which  was to be the preface to that miracle which would prove their Divine  mission.    After a night of fitful sleep and vivid dreams, Stephen at dawn crept  out alone, and hastened to the shore of the sea, where he feasted his  hungry eyes on its surging depths, crying, \"How long, oh, Lord, how  long, before thou wilt show thy power?\" For hours he remained there, by  the sea, and yet there came no pathway for their pilgrim feet to tread.  Soon his army had clustered around him, and there they watched, and  waited, asking eager questions, and Stephen's hour for victory or  defeat had come.    Standing on a rocky height, he spoke, with flashing eyes and ringing  voice, yes, and with an honest conviction of the truth of what he said,  spoke words of hope and cheer that allowed of no backsliding or  complaint, among his followers; and still the weary band kept up their  watch by the shore of that surging sea. The afternoon light deepened,  the sunset came, night spread its glamour over the scene, and yet the  waves rolled on, showing no sign of marvel or of miracle. Over-strained  and broken by discouragement, yet still hopeful, the army waited  through three long days and nights, and still the sea surged on  unchanged, undivided!    Stephen's followers knew the truth at last,--they had been deceived by  a false hope, led by a false leader. Crying out against him who had  brought them to such a plight, so far from home, they vanished one by  one, until of the army that had entered the city, only five thousand  remained.    Bewildered, discouraged, frightened, Stephen knew not where to turn for  help. Dropping on his knees he prayed earnestly for a voice to tell him  of his duty and of God's desire.    Then suddenly his disheartened band of followers saw an unexpected  sight. Stephen, the Prophet, marching alone through the streets of  Marseilles, waving the Oriflamme, singing a song of triumph, shouting  in clear and ringing tones, \"God wills it--God wills it!\"    They surrounded him, when at last he halted, and he spoke first in  denunciation of their unbelief, and then he told of two Marseillian  merchants who had come to him even as he was on his knees praying for  guidance, and offered him vessels to carry his army to Palestine.    These merchants said they asked no passage money of Christ's soldiers  for the trip, the only reward they wished was the consciousness of duty  done to pilgrims in a holy cause, the prayers of the children, and the  honour of having helped the young Crusaders.    Great was the rejoicing now, and great the shame at having for one  moment doubted God's help and the good faith of his servant, Stephen.    Pressing around him as he told his thrilling tale, his followers begged  forgiveness for their lack of faith, which Stephen graciously accorded  and became once again the beloved leader, the honoured prophet.    Such vessels as were needed for the expedition were speedily made  ready, and in Marseilles loud praises were heard on every side of the  generous men who were helping the young Crusaders to fulfil their  mission, then people began to gather to watch the little host embark.    It was a thrilling sight--there in that quiet bay, to see the  Crusaders, trembling with excitement at this new experience--enter the  vessels which were waiting to receive them, while on shore the citizens  of Marseilles were crowding to the front to see the expedition start,  and the gay colours of the flying banners, the bright costumes of the  women, blended with the sunlight in which the fronts of the quaint old  houses were bathed, together with the blue water and the bluer sky,  made a picture both dazzling and beautiful.    When the little army had entered the ships provided for their use, the  solemn ceremonies took place which in those days, when sea voyages were  so perilous, always preceded such an expedition. Then, the religious  exercises being over, all parts of the ships were examined to see that  they were in proper order for such a dangerous voyage, the sailors were  stationed at their respective posts, the anchor chains were loosened,  ready to release the vessels, and the ropes held in hand. There was a  brief silence, then upon the elevated \"castle\" or stern of each ship,  the young army of Crusaders commenced to chant that dear old hymn \"Veni  Creator Spiritus\" which the church in all ages has used on solemn  occasions, and as its words floated from one vessel, they were taken up  on another until the air was full of harmony which was wafted back to  the hills and shore, where the seven vessels were being eagerly watched  out of sight. With none of the noise of modern steamers, those seven  vessels glided out of the quiet harbour, in stately procession and  passed beneath the lofty rock of Notre Dame, and the little voyagers  were at sea.    Soon their songs grow faint as they float over the water, then die  away. After that the flags and banners still tell of joy and hope,  until they too are invisible. The day draws to a close, darkness drops  down and envelops the seven ships sailing towards the promised land  with five thousand courageous little pilgrims on board.    But, alas, for hopes and plans, alas, for the holy ideals of that  little band. Not one of them ever realised his ambition!    Two of those ships which sailed so gaily from the harbour of  Marseilles, laden with the fair and hopeful youths of France, whose  mission was to rescue the Holy Tomb from infidel hands, were wrecked in  a wild storm off the Hermit's rock, lying beneath the cliffs of San  Pietro.    There beneath the \"unplumbed, salt estranging sea\" lies Stephen, the  boy Prophet--who even while the tempest was hurling his army to death  on the open sea, proved the sincerity of his piety; for clinging to a  spar, while drifting to a certain doom, he led his little flock in song  and prayer, and even as wave after wave dashed over the deck, above the  roar of the tempest could his clear triumphant young voice be  heard--\"In the name of Christ and His cross, be brave. We go to  victory--to victory!\"    Hideous indeed were the sufferings of the brave youths in the other  ships, when they saw their comrades drifting to their death, and little  did they dream that they had escaped that terrible storm only to meet  still greater perils. Soon they found that they were victims of an  infamous treachery, that the merchants who had been so praised in  preparing vessels for their use, were simply slave-dealers who had  contracted (and probably for an enormous amount of money)--to sell  those unsuspecting children to the Mohammedans--the very nation whom  the youthful Crusaders had gone forth to conquer, to whom such a  consignment of fair young slaves would be of rare value.    Surrounded by vessels of the enemy, they were taken from the ships in  which they embarked, and despite their agony of fright and pleading,  were carried either to Brijeiah or to Alexandria by their captors,  where among the fairest scenes, and the most wonderful and tropical  beauty they had ever dreamed of, they were sold into hopeless slavery.  Not one of all that army of Stephen's ever saw Europe again, and the  Children's Crusade ended as all enterprises end, whether undertaken by  young or old, layman or priest, warrior or statesman, when conceived  and carried out in a spirit of rebellion and frenzy.    Nicholas and Stephen--boy leaders of the Children's Crusade, one of the  most pathetic and thrilling events in all history, one lived--one died.  Which, think you, had the right to wear the emblem of the Holy Cross?          PETER OF HAARLEM:    The Boy Who Saved His Country      It was an April day, and Haarlem, an old Dutch town near Amsterdam was  gay with tulips, for there in Haarlem are grown the most famous tulips  in all the world, as well as hyacinths, and if you had driven through  the country roads on that April day, you would have seen the meadows  and roadsides overspread with a brilliant carpet of the vari-coloured  flowers, while the air was full of the sweet perfume of the hyacinths,  and you could have carried away with you as many flowers as you had  time and patience to pick.    Holland and its provinces and towns are famous for many other things,  as well as for tulips and hyacinths, for it is a country quite  different from the others which we visit and study about more often,  and although it is a small country in comparison to others which are so  vast in territory, yet there has been none more celebrated for courage  than brave little Holland, and its fight for independence has made it  famous in the historical annals of the world.
