Their report was sustained by the House, and a resolution to suspend the  prohibitory article was adopted. The proposition failed, however, in the  Senate, and there the matter seems to have been dropped. The proceedings  constitute a significant and instructive episode in the political  history of the country.    The allusion which has been made to the Ordinance of 1787, renders it  proper to notice, very briefly, the argument put forward during the  discussion of the Missouri question, and often repeated since, that the  Ordinance afforded a precedent in support of the claim of a power in  Congress to determine the question of the admission of slaves into the  Territories, and in justification of the prohibitory clause applied in  1820 to a portion of the Louisiana Territory.    The difference between the Congress of the Confederation and that of the  Federal Constitution is so broad that the action of the former can, in  no just sense, be taken as a precedent for the latter. The Congress of  the Confederation represented the States in their sovereignty, each  delegation having one vote, so that all the States were of equal weight  in the decision of any question. It had legislative, executive, and in  some degree judicial powers, thus combining all departments of  government in itself. During its recess a committee known as the  Committee of the States exercised the powers of the Congress, which was  in spirit, if not in fact, an assemblage of the States.    On the other hand, the Congress of the Constitution is only the  legislative department of the General Government, with powers strictly  defined and expressly limited to those delegated by the States. It is  further held in check by an executive and a judiciary, and consists of  two branches, each having peculiar and specified functions.    If, then, it be admitted--which is at least very questionable--that the  Congress of the Confederation had rightfully the power to exclude slave  property from the territory northwest of the Ohio River, that power must  have been derived from its character as an assemblage of the sovereign  States; not from the Articles of Confederation, in which no indication  of the grant of authority to exercise such a function can be found. The  Congress of the Constitution is expressly prohibited from the assumption  of any power not distinctly and specifically delegated to it as the  legislative branch of an organized government. What was questionable in  the former case, therefore, becomes clearly inadmissible in the latter.    But there is yet another material distinction to be observed. The  States, owners of what was called the Northwestern Territory, were  component members of the Congress which adopted the Ordinance for its  government, and gave thereto their full and free consent. The Ordinance  may, therefore, be regarded as virtually a treaty between the States  which ceded and those which received that extensive domain. In the other  case, Missouri and the whole region affected by the Missouri Compromise,  were parts of the territory acquired from France under the name of  Louisiana; and, as it requires two parties to make or amend a treaty,  France and the Government of the United States should have cooeperated in  any amendment of the treaty by which Louisiana had been acquired, and  which guaranteed to the inhabitants of the ceded territory \"all the  rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States,\"  and \"the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the religion  they profess.\"--(\"State Papers,\" vol. ii, \"Foreign Relations,\" p. 507.)    For all the reasons thus stated, it seems to me conclusive that the  action of the Congress of the Confederation in 1787 could not constitute  a precedent to justify the action of the Congress of the United States  in 1820, and that the prohibitory clause of the Missouri Compromise was  without constitutional authority, in violation of the rights of a part  of the joint owners of the territory, and in disregard of the  obligations of the treaty with France.    The basis of sectional controversy was the question of the balance of  political power. In its earlier manifestations this was undisguised. The  purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, and the  subsequent admission of a portion of that Territory into the Union as a  State, afforded one of the earliest occasions for the manifestation of  sectional jealousy, and gave rise to the first threats, or warnings  (which proceeded from New England), of a dissolution of the Union. Yet,  although negro slavery existed in Louisiana, no pretext was made of that  as an objection to the acquisition. The ground of opposition is frankly  stated in a letter of that period from one Massachusetts statesman to  another--\"that the influence of _our_ part of the Union must be  diminished by the acquisition of more weight at the other extremity.\"[6]    Some years afterward (in 1819-'20) occurred the memorable contest with  regard to the admission into the Union of Missouri, the second State  carved out of the Louisiana Territory. The controversy arose out of a  proposition to attach to the admission of the new State a proviso  prohibiting slavery or involuntary servitude therein. The vehement  discussion that ensued was continued into the first session of a  different Congress from that in which it originated, and agitated the  whole country during the interval between the two. It was the first  question that ever seriously threatened the stability of the Union, and  the first in which the sentiment of opposition to slavery in the  abstract was introduced as an adjunct of sectional controversy. It was  clearly shown in debate that such considerations were altogether  irrelevant; that the number of existing slaves would not be affected by  their removal from the older States to Missouri; and, moreover, that the  proposed restriction would be contrary to the spirit, if not to the  letter, of the Constitution.[7] Notwithstanding all this, the  restriction was adopted, by a vote almost strictly sectional, in the  House of Representatives. It failed in the Senate through the firm  resistance of the Southern, aided by a few patriotic and conservative  Northern, members of that body. The admission of the new State, without  any restriction, was finally accomplished by the addition to the bill of  a section for ever prohibiting slavery in all that portion of the  Louisiana Territory lying north of thirty-six degrees and thirty  minutes, north latitude, except Missouri--by implication leaving the  portion south of that line open to settlement either with or without  slaves.    This provision, as an offset to the admission of the new State without  restriction, constituted the celebrated Missouri Compromise. It was  reluctantly accepted by a small majority of the Southern members. Nearly  half of them voted against it, under the conviction that it was  unauthorized by the Constitution, and that Missouri was entitled to  determine the question for herself, as a matter of right, not of bargain  or concession. Among those who thus thought and voted were some of the  wisest statesmen and purest patriots of that period.[8]    This brief retrospect may have sufficed to show that the question of the  right or wrong of the institution of slavery was in no wise involved in  the earlier sectional controversies. Nor was it otherwise in those of a  later period, in which it was the lot of the author of these memoirs to  bear a part. They were essentially struggles for sectional equality or  ascendancy--for the maintenance or the destruction of that balance of  power or equipoise between North and South, which was early recognized  as a cardinal principle in our Federal system. It does not follow that  both parties to this contest were wholly right or wholly wrong in their  claims. The determination of the question of right or wrong must be left  to the candid inquirer after examination of the evidence. The object of  these preliminary investigations has been to clear the subject of the  obscurity produced by irrelevant issues and the glamour of ethical  illusions.

The number of these  functionaries is excessive. The four principal towns have each in addition  a prefect of police (_gradonatchalnik_) and one or more commissaries  (_pristav_). The gendarmery numbers about 4000 men, or 1 to 825 of the  inhabitants. The prefects and sub-prefects have replaced the Turkish  _mutessarifs_ and _kaimakams_; but the system of municipal government, left  untouched by the Turks, descends from primitive times. Every commune  (_obshtina_), urban or rural, has its _kmet_, or mayor, and council; the  commune is bound to maintain its primary schools, a public library or  reading-room, &c.; the kmet possesses certain magisterial powers, and in  the rural districts he collects the taxes. Each village, as a rule, forms a  separate commune, but occasionally two or more villages are grouped  together.    _Justice._--The civil and penal codes are, for the most part, based on the  Ottoman law. While the principality formed a portion of the Turkish empire,  the privileges of the capitulations were guaranteed to foreign subjects  (Berlin Treaty, Art. viii.). The lowest civil and criminal court is that of  the village kmet, whose jurisdiction is confined to the limits of the  commune; no corresponding tribunal exists in the towns. Each sub-prefecture  and town has a justice of the peace--in some cases two or more; the number  of these officials is 130. Next follows the departmental tribunal or court  of first instance, which is competent to pronounce sentences of death,  penal servitude and deprivation of civil rights; in specified criminal  cases the judges are aided by three assessors chosen by lot from an  annually prepared panel of forty-eight persons. Three courts of appeal sit  respectively at Sofia, Rustchuk and Philippopolis. The highest tribunal is  the court of cassation, sitting at Sofia, and composed of a president, two  vice-presidents and nine judges. There is also a high court of audit  (_vrkhovna smetna palata_), similar to the French _cour des comptes._ The  judges are poorly paid and are removable by the government. In regard to  questions of marriage, divorce and inheritance the Greek, Mahommedan and  Jewish communities enjoy their own spiritual jurisdiction.    _Army and Navy._--The organization of the military forces of the  principality was undertaken by Russian officers, who for a period of six  years (1879-1885) occupied all the higher posts in the army. In Eastern  Rumelia during the same period the \"militia\" was instructed by foreign  officers; after the union it was merged in the Bulgarian army. The present  organization is based on the law of the 1st of January 1904. The army  consists of: (1) the active or field army (_deistvuyushta armia_), divided  into (i.) the active army, (ii.) the active army reserve; (2) the reserve  army (_reservna armia_); (3) the _opltchenie_ or militia; the two former  may operate outside the kingdom, the latter only within the frontier for  purposes of defence. In time of peace the active army (i.) alone is on a  permanent footing.    The peace strength in 1905 was 2500 officers, 48,200 men and 8000 horses,  the active army being composed of 9 divisions of infantry, each of 4  regiments, 5 regiments of cavalry together with 12 squadrons attached to  the infantry divisions, 9 regiments of artillery each of 3 groups of 3  batteries, together with 2 groups of mountain artillery, each of 3  batteries, and 3 battalions of siege artillery; 9 battalions of engineers  with 1 railway and balloon section and 1 bridging section. At the same date  the army was locally distributed in nine divisional areas with headquarters  at Sofia, Philippopolis, Sliven, Shumla, Rustchuk, Vratza, Plevna,  Stara-Zagora and Dupnitza, the divisional area being subdivided into four  districts, from each of which one regiment of four battalions was recruited  and completed with reservists. In case of mobilization each of the nine  areas would furnish 20,106 men (16,000 infantry, 1200 artillery, 1000  engineers, 300 divisional cavalry and 1606 transport and hospital services,  &c.). The war strength thus amounted to 180,954 of the active army and its  reserve, exclusive of the five regiments of cavalry. In addition the 36  districts each furnished 3 battalions of the reserve army and one battalion  of opltchenie, or 144,000 infantry, which with the cavalry regiments (3000  men) and the reserves of artillery, engineers, divisional cavalry, &c.  (about 10,000), would bring the grand total in time of war to about 338,000  officers and men with 18,000 horses. The men of the reserve battalions are  drafted into the active army as occasion requires, but the militia serves  as a separate force. Military service is obligatory, but Moslems may claim  exemption on payment of L20; the age of recruitment in time of peace is  nineteen, in time of war eighteen. Each conscript serves two years in the  infantry and subsequently eight years in the active reserve, or three years  in the other corps and six years in the active reserve; he is then liable  to seven years' service in the reserve army and finally passes into the  opltchenie. The Bulgarian peasant makes an admirable soldier--courageous,  obedient, persevering, and inured to hardship; the officers are painstaking  and devoted to their duties. The active army and reserve, with the  exception of the engineer regiments, are furnished with the .315\"  Mannlicher magazine rifle, the engineer and militia with the Berdan; the  artillery in 1905 mainly consisted of 8.7- and 7.5-cm. Krupp guns (field)  and 6.5 cm. Krupp (mountain), 12 cm. Krupp and 15 cm. Creuzot (Schneider)  howitzers, 15 cm. Krupp and 12 cm. Creuzot siege guns, and 7.5 cm. Creuzot  quick-firing guns; total of all description, 1154. Defensive works were  constructed at various strategical points near the frontier and elsewhere,  and at Varna and Burgas. The naval force consisted of a flotilla stationed  at Rustchuk and Varna, where a canal connects Lake Devno with the sea. It  was composed in 1905 of 1 prince's yacht, 1 armoured cruiser, 3 gunboats, 3  torpedo boats and 10 other small vessels, with a complement of 107 officers  and 1231 men.    _Religion._--The Orthodox Bulgarian National Church claims to be an  indivisible member of the Eastern Orthodox communion, and asserts historic  continuity with the autocephalous Bulgarian church of the middle ages. It  was, however, declared schismatic by the Greek patriarch of Constantinople  in 1872, although differing in no point of doctrine from the Greek Church.  The Exarch, or supreme head of the Bulgarian Church, resides at  Constantinople; he enjoys the title of \"Beatitude\" (_negovo Blazhenstvo_),  receives an annual subvention of about L6000 from the kingdom, and  exercises jurisdiction over the Bulgarian hierarchy in all parts of the  Ottoman empire. The exarch is elected by the Bulgarian episcopate, the Holy  Synod, and a general assembly (_obshti sbor_), in which the laity is  represented; their choice, before the declaration of Bulgarian  independence, was subject to the sultan's approval. The occupant of the  dignity is titular metropolitan of a Bulgarian diocese. The organization of  the church within the principality was regulated [v.04 p.0779] by statute  in 1883. There are eleven eparchies or dioceses in the country, each  administered by a metropolitan with a diocesan council; one diocese has  also a suffragan bishop. Church government is vested in the Holy Synod,  consisting of four metropolitans, which assembles once a year. The laity  take part in the election of metropolitans and parish priests, only the  \"black clergy,\" or monks, being eligible for the episcopate. All  ecclesiastical appointments are subject to the approval of the government.  There are 2106 parishes (_eporii_) in the kingdom with 9 archimandrites,  1936 parish priests and 21 deacons, 78 monasteries with 184 monks, and 12  convents with 346 nuns. The celebrated monastery of Rila possesses a vast  estate in the Rilska Planina; its abbot or _hegumen_ owns no spiritual  superior but the exarch. Ecclesiastical affairs are under the control of  the minister of public worship; the clergy of all denominations are paid by  the state, being free, however, to accept fees for baptisms, marriages,  burials, the administering of oaths, &c. The census of January 1901 gives  3,019,999 persons of the Orthodox faith (including 66,635 Patriarchist  Greeks), 643,300 Mahommedans, 33,663 Jews, 28,569 Catholics, 13,809  Gregorian Armenians, 4524 Protestants and 419 whose religion is not stated.  The Greek Orthodox community has four metropolitans dependent on the  patriarchate. The Mahommedan community is rapidly diminishing; it is  organized under 16 muftis who with their assistants receive a subvention  from the government. The Catholics, who have two bishops, are for the most  part the descendants of the medieval Paulicians; they are especially  numerous in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis and Sistova. The Armenians  have one bishop. The Protestants are mostly Methodists; since 1857 Bulgaria  has been a special field of activity for American Methodist missionaries,  who have established an important school at Samakov. The Berlin Treaty  (Art. V.) forbade religious disabilities in regard to the enjoyment of  civil and political rights, and guaranteed the free exercise of all  religions.    _Education._--No educational system existed in many of the rural districts  before 1878; the peasantry was sunk in ignorance, and the older generation  remained totally illiterate. In the towns the schools were under the  superintendence of the Greek clergy, and Greek was the language of  instruction. The first Bulgarian school was opened at Gabrovo in 1835 by  the patriots Aprilov and Neophyt Rilski. After the Crimean War, Bulgarian  schools began to appear in the villages of the Balkans and the  south-eastern"]]]
