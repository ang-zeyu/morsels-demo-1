We see this in the case of iron which, however hard it may  naturally be, yet when heated thoroughly in a furnace fire can be easily  worked into any kind of shape, and still, if cooled while it is soft and  white hot, it hardens again with a mere dip into cold water and takes on  its former quality.    4. We may also recognize the truth of this from the fact that in summer  the heat makes everybody weak, not only in unhealthy but even in healthy  places, and that in winter even the most unhealthy districts are much  healthier because they are given a solidity by the cooling off.  Similarly, persons removed from cold countries to hot cannot endure it  but waste away; whereas those who pass from hot places to the cold  regions of the north, not only do not suffer in health from the change  of residence but even gain by it.    5. It appears, then, that in founding towns we must beware of districts  from which hot winds can spread abroad over the inhabitants. For while  all bodies are composed of the four elements (in Greek [Greek:  stoicheia]), that is, of heat, moisture, the earthy, and air, yet there  are mixtures according to natural temperament which make up the natures  of all the different animals of the world, each after its kind.    6. Therefore, if one of these elements, heat, becomes predominant in any  body whatsoever, it destroys and dissolves all the others with its  violence. This defect may be due to violent heat from certain quarters  of the sky, pouring into the open pores in too great proportion to admit  of a mixture suited to the natural temperament of the body in question.  Again, if too much moisture enters the channels of a body, and thus  introduces disproportion, the other elements, adulterated by the liquid,  are impaired, and the virtues of the mixture dissolved. This defect, in  turn, may arise from the cooling properties of moist winds and breezes  blowing upon the body. In the same way, increase or diminution of the  proportion of air or of the earthy which is natural to the body may  enfeeble the other elements; the predominance of the earthy being due to  overmuch food, that of air to a heavy atmosphere.    7. If one wishes a more accurate understanding of all this, he need only  consider and observe the natures of birds, fishes, and land animals, and  he will thus come to reflect upon distinctions of temperament. One form  of mixture is proper to birds, another to fishes, and a far different  form to land animals. Winged creatures have less of the earthy, less  moisture, heat in moderation, air in large amount. Being made up,  therefore, of the lighter elements, they can more readily soar away into  the air. Fish, with their aquatic nature, being moderately supplied with  heat and made up in great part of air and the earthy, with as little of  moisture as possible, can more easily exist in moisture for the very  reason that they have less of it than of the other elements in their  bodies; and so, when they are drawn to land, they leave life and water  at the same moment. Similarly, the land animals, being moderately  supplied with the elements of air and heat, and having less of the  earthy and a great deal of moisture, cannot long continue alive in the  water, because their portion of moisture is already abundant.    8. Therefore, if all this is as we have explained, our reason showing us  that the bodies of animals are made up of the elements, and these  bodies, as we believe, giving way and breaking up as a result of excess  or deficiency in this or that element, we cannot but believe that we  must take great care to select a very temperate climate for the site of  our city, since healthfulness is, as we have said, the first requisite.    9. I cannot too strongly insist upon the need of a return to the method  of old times. Our ancestors, when about to build a town or an army post,  sacrificed some of the cattle that were wont to feed on the site  proposed and examined their livers. If the livers of the first victims  were dark-coloured or abnormal, they sacrificed others, to see whether  the fault was due to disease or their food. They never began to build  defensive works in a place until after they had made many such trials  and satisfied themselves that good water and food had made the liver  sound and firm. If they continued to find it abnormal, they argued from  this that the food and water supply found in such a place would be just  as unhealthy for man, and so they moved away and changed to another  neighbourhood, healthfulness being their chief object.    10. That pasturage and food may indicate the healthful qualities of a  site is a fact which can be observed and investigated in the case of  certain pastures in Crete, on each side of the river Pothereus, which  separates the two Cretan states of Gnosus and Gortyna. There are cattle  at pasture on the right and left banks of that river, but while the  cattle that feed near Gnosus have the usual spleen, those on the other  side near Gortyna have no perceptible spleen. On investigating the  subject, physicians discovered on this side a kind of herb which the  cattle chew and thus make their spleen small. The herb is therefore  gathered and used as a medicine for the cure of splenetic people. The  Cretans call it [Greek: hasplenon]. From food and water, then, we may  learn whether sites are naturally unhealthy or healthy.    11. If the walled town is built among the marshes themselves, provided  they are by the sea, with a northern or north-eastern exposure, and are  above the level of the seashore, the site will be reasonable enough. For  ditches can be dug to let out the water to the shore, and also in times  of storms the sea swells and comes backing up into the marshes, where  its bitter blend prevents the reproductions of the usual marsh  creatures, while any that swim down from the higher levels to the shore  are killed at once by the saltness to which they are unused. An instance  of this may be found in the Gallic marshes surrounding Altino, Ravenna,  Aquileia, and other towns in places of the kind, close by marshes. They  are marvellously healthy, for the reasons which I have given.    12. But marshes that are stagnant and have no outlets either by rivers  or ditches, like the Pomptine marshes, merely putrefy as they stand,  emitting heavy, unhealthy vapours. A case of a town built in such a spot  was Old Salpia in Apulia, founded by Diomede on his way back from Troy,  or, according to some writers, by Elpias of Rhodes. Year after year  there was sickness, until finally the suffering inhabitants came with a  public petition to Marcus Hostilius and got him to agree to seek and  find them a proper place to which to remove their city. Without delay he  made the most skilful investigations, and at once purchased an estate  near the sea in a healthy place, and asked the Senate and Roman people  for permission to remove the town. He constructed the walls and laid out  the house lots, granting one to each citizen for a mere trifle. This  done, he cut an opening from a lake into the sea, and thus made of the  lake a harbour for the town. The result is that now the people of Salpia  live on a healthy site and at a distance of only four miles from the old  town.          CHAPTER V    THE CITY WALLS      1. After insuring on these principles the healthfulness of the future  city, and selecting a neighbourhood that can supply plenty of food  stuffs to maintain the community, with good roads or else convenient  rivers or seaports affording easy means of transport to the city, the  next thing to do is to lay the foundations for the towers and walls. Dig  down to solid bottom, if it can be found, and lay them therein, going as  deep as the magnitude of the proposed work seems to require. They should  be much thicker than the part of the walls that will appear above  ground, and their structure should be as solid as it can possibly be  laid.    2. The towers must be projected beyond the line of wall, so that an  enemy wishing to approach the wall to carry it by assault may be exposed  to the fire of missiles on his open flank from the towers on his right  and left. Special pains should be taken that there be no easy avenue by  which to storm the wall. The roads should be encompassed at steep  points, and planned so as to approach the gates, not in a straight line,  but from the right to the left; for as a result of this, the right hand  side of the assailants, unprotected by their shields, will be next the  wall. Towns should be laid out not as an exact square nor with salient  angles, but in circular form, to give a view of the enemy from many  points. Defence is difficult where there are salient angles, because the  angle protects the enemy rather than the inhabitants.    3. The thickness of the wall should, in my opinion, be such that armed  men meeting on top of it may pass one another without interference. In  the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made  of charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like  pins, to give it lasting endurance. For that is a material which neither  decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the  earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not  only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require  a thickness like that of a city wall, will be long in falling to decay  if tied in this manner.    4. The towers should be set at intervals of not more than a bowshot  apart, so that in case of an assault upon any one of them, the enemy may  be repulsed with scorpiones and other means of hurling missiles from the  towers to the right and left. Opposite the inner side of every tower the  wall should be interrupted for a space the width of the tower, and have  only a wooden flooring across, leading to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#6)"],[1,"of the  Bible, our visitor perceives that the Old Testament gradually evolved  from the tenth century to the second century B.C., and in its present  form is mainly a fifth century compilation, so distorting the facts  that it has taken scholars one hundred and fifty years to get them  straight. \"It may rightly be said that there is not a single book in the  Bible which is original in the sense of having been written by one man,  for all the books are made up of older documents or pre-existing sources  which were combined with later materials, undergoing, in this way,  several revisions and editions at the hands of different scribes or  compilers. Deep traces have therefore been left upon the text of the  Bible by these several stages of expansions, additions, modifications,  revisions, and incorporations--they appear to the scholar of biblical  literature much like the striations grooved in the rocks by large  glaciers to the student of Geology.\" (_Trattner, \"Unravelling the Book  of Books._\")    The Martian ascertains that to most thinking men it has become very  obvious that the Bible is the work of man, and not the inspiration of a  god; that an increasing number of liberal theologians are discarding the  theory of the divine inspiration of the Bible. He likewise clearly  perceives that there are as yet many men that have given this matter but  little thought; with the Divine inspiration looming up as a corner stone  in the Hebrew faith he realizes that it behooves him to carry his  investigations further.    The Christians, accepting the Old Testament as a book dictated by God,  had fixed the age of the earth as 4004 B.C. The harm done by the  Christian ecclesiastics in attempting to force science to conform to the  ridiculous concept of the construction of the universe as contained in  the Bible, and as interpreted by the Church, the Martian considers in a  further chapter. Scientists incline to the view that the earth has  existed as a separate planet for something like two thousand million  years (2,000,000,000). The rocks give a history of 16,000,000,000. Just  as in the study of the origin of primitive beliefs, one finds that man  made his gods and invented all that they are reported to have said, so a  study of the Old Testament reveals that the ancient Hebrew invented his  God, and manufactured the vast mass of myth and fable that are recorded  as the words and deeds of God. Throughout the ages, the words of these  ancient Hebrews have been taken as the words of a god.    \"Everything goes to show that the Hebrew literature was produced like  other literatures. Hebrews were not the first to tell tales. When they  did come to write 'for our learning' they borrowed from other people.  The only reason why anything more than a literary attention is paid to  these old Jewish writings is that Jesus was a Jew. When Christianity was  founded--a difficult date to fix--there was no such thing as a Bible.  The old Brahmans and Buddhists had Holy Scriptures; the Egyptians had a  Book of the Dead, and the Sayings of Khuenaten; the Persians had the  Zend-Avesta; the Chinese had sacred books. They were all as sacred as  the Jewish books. Priests made them sacred. Priests generally rewrote  and edited them, even if they had not originally imagined them. There is  nothing to guide the man of common sense save knowledge and reason.  Every priest swears his religion and his scriptures are true. But they  cannot all be true. If the first are true, then the Jews are past  further consideration, for they were not the first in the field with  sacred writings.... Holy scriptures are merely Jewish classics. We have  had to accept these old writings of the Hebrews as holy and inspired  because the priests said so, and for no other reason whatsoever. There  is no other reason.\" Assuming the existence of a deity, a man exercising  his common sense would be compelled to deny that the Old Testament is  inspired of God, because it abounds in stupidities and errors such as  no god could inspire. \"But because the Jews accumulated these writings,  the subsequent adopters of Christianity, realizing that Jesus was a Jew,  and had been a professing Jew, promptly annexed these tales of fancy and  of fear, of muddled, sensual, silly things and said they must be  accepted with the teachings of Jesus. And in the course of time, people  had to believe these old Jewish writings were the Word of God.\" (_W. H.  Williamson, \"Thinker or Believer_.\")    The Hebrews had as one of their gods, Yahveh, whom they endowed with  their qualities; qualities inherent in a primitive people: jealousy and  might, trickery and fickleness. They evolved a worship that contained in  a modified form many of the ceremonials that they witnessed when they  came into contact with the Babylonians and Phoenicians. Their Bible  they maintained to be a collection of books which appeared at intervals,  with divine inspiration, during a thousand years of Jewish history.  Similarly, they insisted that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, that Judges,  Kings, and Chronicles go back to the times they describe, that the  prophecies were added from the ninth century onward, and so on.    The Martian found that not a single book of the Old Testament is older  than the ninth century B.C. and that in the fifth century B.C. all the  older books and fragments were combined together into the Old Testament  as we have it, and were drastically altered so as to yield a version of  early Jewish history which is not true. The manipulation of the Hebrew  writings by the Jewish priests had for its object to represent the  Jewish priesthood, and its rights and customs, as having been  established in the days of Moses. Deuteronomy and Leviticus have been  classed as priestly forgeries. Nearly every occurrence, from the  creation of the world to the death of Moses, is related twice and, in  some cases, three times; and as the Pentateuch is supposed to have been  written by Moses one must assume that Moses had double and triple  vision.    Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah are impudent forgeries of the fourth  century, giving a totally false version of the events. The Martian finds  that the terms used for these fabrications are \"redaction\" or  \"recension,\" but, in his understanding, he finds the word most  descriptive of the process to be forgery. \"The main point is that  practically all the experts assure you that in scores of material points  the Old Testament history has been discredited, and has only been  confirmed in a few unimportant incidental statements; and that the books  are a tissue of inventions, expansions, conflations, or recensions  dating centuries after the event.\"    The Martian in his analysis becomes aware of instances related in the  Old Testament that on his planet would have to be termed  forgeries,--deliberate falsifications or fabrications of documents or of  the signature to them. \"Now the far greater part of the more learned  clerical authorities on the Bible say that many books of the Old  Testament pretend to be written by men who did not write them; that many  books were deliberately written as history when the writers knew that  they were not history; and that the Old Testament as a whole, as we have  it, is a deliberate attempt to convey an historical belief which the  writers knew to be false. But these learned authorities do not like the  word forgery. It is crude.\" (_Joseph McCabe, \"The Forgery of The Old  Testament.\"_) They veil the meaning of this word in the elegance, the  subtlety, the resources, of diplomatic language. They talk of certain  books in terms of \"their legendary character,\" \"their conformity to a  scheme,\" and \"their didactic purpose.\" To the Martian these are but an  extremely polite description of what he would call a forgery.    A theologian in speaking of David states that \"Keen criticism is  necessary to arrive at the kernel of fact,\" and, \"the imaginative  element in the story of David is but the vesture which half conceals,  half discloses certain facts treasured in popular tradition.\" The  Martian thinks this is polite language, but the word forgery is much  more concise and to the point, and he finds an excellent example of this  described by Joseph McCabe in \"The Forgery of the Old Testament.\" He  states, \"Some time ago we recovered tablets of the great Persian king,  Cyrus, and Professor Sayre gives us a translation of them, and he  compares them, as you may, with the words of Daniel, 'In that night was  Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldeans, slain, and Darius the Median took  the kingdom.' The tablets of Cyrus describe the taking of Babylon, and  are beyond the slightest suspicion. The Persians had adopted the  Babylonian custom of writing on clay, then baking the brick or tablet,  and such documents last forever. And these and other authentic and  contemporary documents of the age which 'Daniel' describes show:         1. That Belshazzar was not the king of Babylon.         2. That the name of the last king was Nabonidos.         3. That the city was taken peacefully, by guile, not by bloodshed.         4. That it was Cyrus, not Darius the Median, who took it.         5. That Darius, who is said (XI, 1) by Daniel to have been the son       of \"Ahasuerus\" (Xerxes), was really his father.         6. That all the Babylonian names in Daniel are absurdly misspelt       and quite strange to the writer.         7. That the writer described the Chaldeans in a way that no writer       could have done before the time of Alexander the Great.    It is now beyond question that the man who wrote Daniel, and pretended  to be alive in 539 B.C. (when Babylon fell), did not live until three or  four centuries later. The book is a tissue of errors, as we find by  authentic documents and by reading the real Babylonian names on the  tablets.\"    The Martian discovers glaring instances of forgery in the book of Isaiah  and the Psalms of David, which, "]]]
