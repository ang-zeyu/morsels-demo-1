The beacon brands which had served to  guide them were thrown hissing into the water, and Edward found himself  lifted out of the boat by brawny arms and carried almost bodily into the  depths of the cavern. Presently, however, he was allowed to walk, though  still guided on either side, when suddenly at a turn of the rock  passage, the cave opened out, and Edward found the famous Cateran,  Donald Bean Lean, and his whole establishment plain before his eyes.    The cavern was lit with pine torches, and about a charcoal fire five or  six Highlanders were seated, while in the dusk behind several others  slumbered, wrapped in their plaids. In a large recess to one side were  seen the carcasses of both sheep and cattle, hung by the heels as in a  butcher's shop, some of them all too evidently the spoils of the Baron  of Bradwardine's flocks and herds.    The master of this strange dwelling came forward to welcome Edward,  while Evan Dhu stood by his side to make the necessary introductions.  Edward had expected to meet with a huge savage warrior in the captain of  such banditti, but to his surprise he found Donald Bean Lean to be a  little man, pale and insignificant in appearance, and not even Highland  in dress. For at one time Donald had served in the French army. So now,  instead of receiving Edward in his national costume, he had put on an  old blue-and-red foreign uniform, in which he made so strange a figure  that, though it was donned in his honour, his visitor had hard work to  keep from laughing. Nor was the freebooter's conversation more in accord  with his surroundings. He talked much of Edward's family and  connections, and especially of his uncle's Jacobite politics--on which  last account, he seemed inclined to welcome the young man with more  cordiality than, as a soldier of King George, Edward felt to be his due.  The scene which followed was, however, better fitted to the time and  place.    At a half-savage feast Edward had the opportunity of tasting steaks  fresh cut from some of the Baron's cattle, broiled on the coals before  his eyes, and washed down with draughts of Highland whiskey.    Yet in spite of the warmth of his welcome, there was something very  secret and unpleasant about the shifty cunning glance of this little  robber-chief, who seemed to know so much about the royal garrisons, and  even about the men of Edward's own troop whom he had brought with him  from Waverley-Honour.    When at last they were left alone together, Evan Dhu having lain down in  his plaid, the little captain of cattle-lifters asked Captain Waverley  in a very significant manner, \"if he had nothing particular to say to  him.\"    Edward, a little startled at the tone in which the question was put,  answered that he had no other reason for coming to the cave but a desire  to see so strange a dwelling-place.    For a moment Donald Bean Lean looked him full in the face, as if waiting  for something more, and then, with a nod full of meaning, he muttered:  \"You might as well have confided in me. I am as worthy of trust as  either the Baron of Bradwardine or Vich Ian Vohr! But you are equally  welcome to my house!\"    His heather bed, the flickering of the fire, the smoking torches, and  the movement of the wild outlaws going and coming about the cave, soon,  however, diverted Waverley's thoughts from the mysterious words of his  host. His eyelids drew together, nor did he reopen them till the morning  sun, reflected from the lake, was filling all the cave with a glimmering  twilight.      THE SECOND INTERLUDE        As soon as this part of the tale was finished, the      audience showed much greater eagerness to enter      immediately upon the acting of Donald Bean Lean's      cattle-raid, and its consequences, than it had      previously displayed as to the doings of Edward      Waverley.        As Hugh John admitted, this was \"something like!\"      The Abbey precincts were instantly filled with the      mingled sounds characteristic of all well-conducted      forays, and it was well indeed that the place was      wholly deserted. For the lowings of the driven      cattle, the shouts of the triumphant Highlanders,      the deep rage of the Baron, stalking to and fro      wrapped in his cloak on the Castle terrace, might      well have astonished the crowd which in these      summer days comes from the four corners of the      world \"to view fair Melrose aright.\"        It was not till the edge had worn off their first      enthusiasm, that it became possible to collect them      again in order to read \"The Hold of a Highland      Robber,\" which makes Chapter Seventeenth of      _Waverley_ itself. And the reading so fired the      enthusiasm of Sweetheart that she asked for the      book to take to bed with her. The boys were more      practical, though equally enthusiastic.        \"Wait till we get home,\" cried Hugh John, cracking      his fingers and thumbs. \"I know a proper place for      Donald Bean Lean's cave.\"        \"And I,\" said Sir Toady Lion, \"will light a fire by      the pond and toss the embers into the water. It      will be jolly to hear 'em hiss, I tell you!\"        \"But what,\" asked Maid Margaret, \"shall we do for      the cattle and sheep that were hanging by the      heels, when Edward went into Donald Bean Lean's      cave?\"        \"Why, we will hang _you_ up by the heels and cut      slices off you!\" said Sir Toady, with frowning      truculence.        Whereat the little girl, a little solemnised, began      to edge away from the dangerous neighbourhood of      such a pair of young cannibals. Sweetheart      reproached her brothers for inventing calumnies      against their countrymen.        \"Even the Highlanders were never so wicked,\" she      objected; \"they did not eat one another.\"        \"Well, anyway,\" retorted Sir Toady Lion, unabashed,      \"Sawney Bean did. Perhaps he was a cousin of      Donald's, though in the history it says that he      came from East Lothian.\"        \"Yes,\" cried Hugh John, \"and in an old book written      in Latin it says (father read it to us) that one of      his little girls was too young to be executed with      the rest on the sands of Leith. So the King sent      her to be brought up by kind people, where she was      brought up without knowing anything of her father,      the cannibal, and her mother, the cannibaless--\"        \"Oh,\" cried Sweetheart, who knew what was coming,      putting up her hands over her ears, \"please don't      tell that dreadful story all over again.\"        \"Father read it out of a book--so there!\" cried Sir      Toady, implacably, \"go on, Hugh John!\"        \"And so when this girl was about as big as      Sweetheart, and, of course, could not remember her      grandfather's nice cave or the larder where the      arms and legs were hung up to dry in the smoke--\"        \"Oh, you horrid boy!\" cried Sweetheart, not,      however, removing herself out of ear-shot--because,      after all, it was nice to shiver just a little.        \"Oh, yes, and I have seen the cave,\" cried Sir      Toady, \"it is on the shore near Ballantrae--a      horrid place. Go on, Hugh John, tell about Sawney      Bean's grandchild!\"        \"Well, she grew up and up, playing with dolls just      like other girls, till she was old enough to be      sent out to service. And after she had been a while      about the house to which she went, it was noticed      that some of the babies in the neighbourhood began      to go a-missing, and they found--\"        \"I think she was a nursemaid!\" interrupted Sir      Toady, dispassionately. \"That must have been it.      The little wretches cried--_so she ate them!_\"        \"Oh,\" cried Sweetheart, stopping her ears with her      fingers, \"don't tell us what they found--I believe      you made it all up, anyway.\"        \"No, I didn't,\" cried Hugh John, shouting in her      ear as if to a very deaf person, \"it was father who      read it to us, out of a big book with fat black      letters. So it must be true!\"        Sir Toady was trying to drag away his sister's arms      that she might have the benefit of details, when I      appeared in the distance. Whereupon Hugh John, who      felt his time growing limited, concluded thus, \"And      when they were taking the girl away to hang her,      the minister asked her why she had killed the      babies, and she answered him, 'If people only knew      how good babies were--especially little      girls--_there would not be one left between Forth      and Solway!_'\"        Then quite unexpectedly Maid Margaret began to sob      bitterly.        \"They _shan't_ hang me up and eat me,\" she cried,      running as hard as she could and flinging herself      into my arms; \"Hugh John and Sir Toady say they      will, as soon as we get home.\"        Happily I had a light cane of a good vintage in my      hand, and it did not take long to convince the pair      of young scamps of the inconvenience of frightening      their little sister. Sweetheart looked on      approvingly as two forlorn young men were walked      off to a supper, healthfully composed of plain      bread and butter, and washed down by some nice cool      water from the pump.        \"I told you!\" she said, \"you wouldn't believe me.\"        All the same she was tender-hearted enough to      convey a platter of broken meats secretly up to      their \"condemned cell,\" as I knew from finding the      empty plate under their washstand in the morning.      And as Maid Margaret was being carried off to be      bathed and comforted, a Voice, passing their door,      threatened additional pains and penalties to little      boys who frightened their sisters.        \"It was all in a book,\" said Hugh John, defending      himself from under the bedclothes, \"father read it      to us!\"        \"We did it for her good,\" suggested Sir Toady.        \"If I hear another word"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#6)"],[1," illustration: all came from old colonial houses. The iron lamp, solid  with the accumulated grease of centuries, was found in a Virginia cabin;  the rectangular brass lamp came from a Dutch farmhouse; and the graceful  oval brass lamp from a New England homestead.    Pewter was a favorite material for lamps, as it was for all other  domestic utensils. It was specially in favor for the lamps for whale  oil and the \"Porter's fluid,\" that preceded our present illuminating  medium, petroleum. A rare form is the pewter lamp here shown. It is in  the collection of ancient lamps, lanterns, candlesticks, etc., owned by  Mrs. Samuel Bowne Duryea, of Brooklyn. It came from a Salem home, where  it was used as a house-lantern. With its clear bull's-eyes of unusually  pure glass, it gave what was truly a brilliant light for the century of  its use. A group of old pewter lamps, of the shapes commonly used in the  homes of our ancestors a century or so ago, is also given; chosen, not  because they were unusual or beautiful, but because they were universal  in their use.    The lamps of Count Rumford's invention were doubtless a great luxury,  with their clear steady light; but they were too costly to be commonly  seen in our grandfathers' homes. Nor were Argand burners ever universal.  Glass lamps of many simple shapes shared popularity for a long time with  the pewter lamps; and as pewter gradually disappeared from household  use, these glass lamps monopolized the field. They were rarely of cut or  colored glass, but were pressed glass of commonplace form and quality. A  group of them is here given which were all used in old New England  houses in the early part of this century.    For many years the methods of striking a light were very primitive, just  as they were in Europe; many families possessed no adequate means, or  very imperfect ones. If by ill fortune the fire in the fireplace became  wholly extinguished through carelessness at night, some one, usually a  small boy, was sent to the house of the nearest neighbor, bearing a  shovel or covered pan, or perhaps a broad strip of green bark, on which  to bring back coals for relighting the fire. Nearly all families had  some form of a flint and steel,--a method of obtaining fire which has  been used from time immemorial by both civilized and uncivilized  nations. This always required a flint, a steel, and a tinder of some  vegetable matter to catch the spark struck by the concussion of flint  and steel. This spark was then blown into a flame. Among the colonists  scorched linen was a favorite tinder to catch the spark of fire; and  till this century all the old cambric handkerchiefs, linen underwear,  and worn sheets of a household were carefully saved for this purpose.  The flint, steel, and tinder were usually kept together in a circular  tinder-box, such as is shown in the accompanying illustration; it was a  shape universal in England and America. This had an inner flat cover  with a ring, a flint, a horseshoe-shaped steel, and an upper lid with a  place to set a candle-end in, to carry the newly acquired light. Though  I have tried hundreds of times with this tinder-box, I have never yet  succeeded in striking a light. The sparks fly, but then the operation  ceases in modern hands. Charles Dickens said if you had good luck, you  could get a light in half an hour. Soon there was an improvement on this  tinder-box, by which sparks were obtained by spinning a steel wheel with  a piece of cord, somewhat like spinning a humming top, and making the  wheel strike a flint fixed in the side of a little trough full of  tinder. This was an infinite advance in convenience on tinder-box No. 1.  This box was called in the South a mill; one is here shown. Then some  person invented strips of wood dipped in sulphur and called \"spunks.\"  These readily caught fire, and retained it, and were handy to carry  light to a candle or pile of chips.    Another way of starting a fire was by flashing a little powder in the  pan of an old-fashioned gun; sometimes this fired a twist of tow, which  in turn started a heap of shavings.    Down to the time of our grandfathers, and in some country homes of our  fathers, lights were started with these crude elements,--flint, steel,  tinder,--and transferred by the sulphur splint; for fifty years ago  matches were neither cheap nor common.    Though various processes for lighting in which sulphur was used in a  match shape, were brought before the public at the beginning of this  century, they were complicated, expensive, and rarely seen. The first  practical friction matches were \"Congreves,\" made in England in 1827.  They were thin strips of wood or cardboard coated with sulphur and  tipped with a mixture of mucilage, chlorate of potash, and sulphide of  antimony. Eighty-four of them were sold in a box for twenty-five cents,  with a piece of \"glass-paper\" through which the match could be drawn.  There has been a long step this last fifty years between the tinder-box  used so patiently for two centuries, and the John Jex Long match-making  machine of our times, which turns out seventeen million matches a day.          CHAPTER III    THE KITCHEN FIRESIDE      The kitchen in all the farmhouses of all the colonies was the most  cheerful, homelike, and picturesque room in the house; indeed, it was in  town houses as well. The walls were often bare, the rafters dingy; the  windows were small, the furniture meagre; but the kitchen had a warm,  glowing heart that spread light and welcome, and made the poor room a  home. In the houses of the first settlers the chimneys and fireplaces  were vast in size, sometimes so big that the fore-logs and back-logs for  the fire had to be dragged in by a horse and a long chain; or a  hand-sled was kept for the purpose. Often there were seats within the  chimney on either side. At night children could sit on these seats and  there watch the sparks fly upward and join the stars which could plainly  be seen up the great chimney-throat.    But as the forests disappeared under the waste of burning for tar, for  potash, and through wanton clearing, the fireplaces shrank in size; and  Benjamin Franklin, even in his day, could write of \"the fireplaces of  our fathers.\"    The inflammable catted chimney of logs and clay, hurriedly and readily  built by the first settlers, soon gave place in all houses to vast  chimneys of stone, built with projecting inner ledges, on which rested a  bar about six or seven or even eight feet from the floor, called a  lug-pole (lug meaning to carry) or a back-bar; this was made of green  wood, and thus charred slowly--but it charred surely in the generous  flames of the great chimney heart. Many annoying, and some fatal  accidents came from the collapsing of these wooden back-bars. The  destruction of a dinner sometimes was attended with the loss of a life.  Later the back-bars were made of iron. On them were hung iron hooks or  chains with hooks of various lengths called pothooks, trammels, hakes,  pot-hangers, pot-claws, pot-clips, pot-brakes, pot-crooks. Mr. Arnold  Talbot, of Providence, Rhode Island, has folding trammels, nine feet  long, which were found in an old Narragansett chimney heart. Gibcrokes  and recons were local and less frequent names, and the folks who in  their dialect called the lug-pole a gallows-balke called the pothooks  gallows-crooks. On these hooks pots and kettles could be hung at varying  heights over the fire. The iron swinging-crane was a Yankee invention of  a century after the first settlement, and it proved a convenient and  graceful substitute for the back-bar.    Some Dutch houses had an adaptation of a Southern method of housekeeping  in the use of a detached house called a slave-kitchen, where the meals  of the negro house and farm servants were cooked and served. The  slave-kitchen of the old Bergen homestead stood unaltered till within a  few years on Third Avenue in Brooklyn. It still exists in a dismantled  condition. Its picture plainly shows the stone ledges within the  fireplace, the curved iron lug-pole, and hanging pothooks and trammels.  With ample fire of hickory logs burning on the hearthstone, and the  varied array of primitive cooking-vessels steaming with savory fare, a  circle of laughing, black faces shining with the glowing firelight and  hungry anticipation, would make a \"Dutch interior\" of American form and  shaping as picturesque and artistic as any of Holland. The fireplace  itself sometimes went by the old English name, clavell-piece, as shown  by the letters of John Wynter, written from Maine in 1634 to his English  home. \"The Chimney is large, with an oven at each end of him: he is so  large that wee can place our Cyttle within the Clavell-piece. Wee can  brew and bake and boyl our Cyttle all at once in him.\" Often a large  plate of iron, called the fire-back or fire-plate, was set at the back  of the chimney, where the constant and fierce fire crumbled brick and  split stone. These iron backs were often cast in a handsome design.    In New York the chimneys and fireplaces were Dutch in shape; the  description given by a woman traveller at the end of the seventeenth  century ran thus:--         \"The chimney-places are very droll-like: they have no jambs nor       lintell as we have, but a flat grate, and there projects over it a       lum in the form of the cat-and-clay lum, and commonly a muslin or       ruffled pawn around it.\"    The \"ruffled pawn\" was a calico or linen valance which was hung on the  edge of the mantel-shelf, a pretty and cheerful fashion seen in some  English as well as Dutch homes.    Another Dutch furnishing, the alcove bedstead, much like a closet, seen  in many New York kitchens, was replaced in New England farm-kitchens by  the \"turn-up\" bedstead. This was a strong frame filled with a network of  rope which was fastened at the bed-head by hinges to the wall. By night  the foot of the bed rested on two heavy "]]]
