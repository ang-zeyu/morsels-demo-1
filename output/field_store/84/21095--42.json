[Footnote *: For general bibliography see p. 4.]          CHAPTER III.    SEASONING.      The seasoning of wood is important for several reasons. It reduces  weight, it increases strength, it prevents changes in volume after it  is worked into shape, and it prevents checking and decay. Decay can  also be prevented by submergence and burying, if by so doing logs are  kept from fungal attacks. The piles of the Swiss Lake dwellings, which  are in a state of good preservation, are of prehistoric age. Wood  under water lasts longer than steel or iron under water. But for  almost all purposes wood has to be dried in order to be preserved. The  wood is cut up, when green, to as thin pieces as will be convenient  for its use later, for the rate of drying depends largely upon the  shape and size of the piece, an inch board drying more than four times  as fast as a four inch plank, and more than twenty times as fast as a  ten inch timber.    There are various methods of seasoning:    (1) Natural or air-seasoning is the most common, and in some respects  the best. In this method, the wood is carefully and regularly piled in  the seasoning-yard, so as to be protected as far as possible from sun  and rain, but with air circulating freely on all sides of the boards,  Fig. 47, see p. 38. To accomplish this, \"sticking\" is employed, i. e.,  strips of wood are placed crosswise close to the ends and at intervals  between the boards. In this way the weight of the superposed boards  tends to keep those under them from warping. The pile is skidded a  foot or two off the ground and is protected above by a roof made of  boards so laid that the rain will drain off.    Fire-wood is best dried rapidly so that it will check, making air  spaces which facilitate ignition, but lumber needs to be slowly dried  in cool air so that the fibers may accommodate themselves to the  change of form and the wood check as little as possible. Good  air-drying consumes from two to six years, the longer the better.    (2) Kiln-drying or hot-air-seasoning is a much more rapid process than  air-seasoning and is now in common use, Fig. 57. The drying is also  more complete, for while air-dried wood retains from 10% to 20% of  moisture, kiln-dried wood may have no more than 5% as it comes from  the kiln. It will, however, reabsorb some moisture from the air, when  exposed to it.    The wood of conifers, with its very regular structure, dries  and shrinks more evenly and much more rapidly than the wood of  broad-leaved trees, and hence is often put into the kiln without  previous air-drying, and dried in a week or even less time.    Oak is the most difficult wood to dry properly. When it and other  hardwoods are rapidly dried without sufficient surrounding moisture,  the wood \"case-hardens,\" that is, the outer part dries and shrinks  before the interior has had a chance to do the same, and this forms a  shell or case of shrunken, and often checked wood around the  interior which also checks later. This interior checking is called  honeycombing. Hardwood lumber is commonly air-dried from two to six  months, before being kiln-dried. For the sake of economy in time,  the tendency is to eliminate yard-drying, and substitute kiln-drying.  Kiln-drying of one inch oak, takes one or two weeks, quarter-sawn  boards taking one and a half times as long as plain-sawn.    The best method of drying is that which gradually raises the  temperature of both the wood and of the water which it contains to the  point at which the drying is to take place. Care is therefore taken  not to let the surface become entirely dry before the internal  moisture is heated. This is done by retaining the moisture first  vaporized about the wood, by means of wet steam. When the surface is  made permeable to moisture, drying may take place rapidly. Curtains  of canvas are hung all around the lumber on the same principle  that windows in newly plastered buildings are hung with muslin.  The moisture is absorbed on the inner surface of the curtain and  evaporates from the outer surface. Improvements in kiln-drying are  along the line of moist air operation. In common practice, however,  the moist air principle is often neglected.    There are two methods in operation, the progressive method and the  charge method. In the progressive, the process is continuous, the  loads going in at one end of the kiln, and out at the other, the  temperature and the moisture being so distributed in the kiln, that  in passing from the green to the dry end, a load of lumber is first  moistened, then heated, and finally dried out. In the charge system,  the process is intermittent, one charge being removed before a new one  is admitted. This gives the best results with high grade lumber for  special uses.    A modification of hot-air-seasoning is that which subjects the wood to  a moderate heat in a moist atmosphere charged with the products of the  combustion of fuel.    (3) Small pieces of wood may be effectively seasoned by being boiled  in water and then dried. The process seems to consist of dissolving  out albuminous substances and thus allowing freer evaporation. Its  effect is probably weakening.    (4) Soaking in water is sometimes used as a good preparation for  air-seasoning. Previous soaking hastens seasoning. River men insist  that timber is improved by rafting. It is a common practice to let  cypress logs soak in the swamps where they grow for several months  before they are \"mined out.\" They are eagerly sought after by joiners  and carpenters, because their tendency to warp is lessened. Ebony is  water-soaked in the island of Mauritius as soon as cut. Salt water  renders wood harder, heavier, and more durable and is sometimes  applied to ship timbers, but cannot be used with timbers intended for  ordinary purposes, as the presence of salt tends to absorb atmospheric  moisture.    (5) Boiling in oil is resorted to for special purposes, both for  preservation and to give strength. For example, the best handscrews  are so treated. The oil also prevents glue from sticking, the most  frequent cause of injury to handscrews.    (6) There are a number of \"impregnation\" methods of preserving timber,  and their practice is spreading rapidly. Of the various preservative  processes, those using coal tar creosote and zinc chloride have proved  most efficient. The purpose is to force the preservative into the  pores of the wood, either by painting, soaking, or putting under  pressure. Such impregnation methods double or treble the life of  railway ties. It is now being used with great success to preserve  electric wire poles, mine-props, piling, fence-posts, etc.    Wood preservation has three great advantages, it prolongs the life  of timbers in use, reduces their cost, and makes possible the use of  species that once were considered worthless. For example, the cheap  and abundant loblolly pine can be made, by preservative methods, to  take the place of high priced long-leaf pine for many purposes.      PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR STORING LUMBER.    Under the hasty methods prevalent in the mill, very little wood comes  to the shop well seasoned, and it should therefore be carefully stored  before using, so as to have the fullest possible air circulation  around it. Where the boards are large enough, \"sticking\" is the best  method of storage, i. e., narrow strips of wood are placed at short  intervals between the pieces which are piled flat. The weight of the  boards themselves helps to prevent warping. Boards set upright or  on edge are likely to be distorted soon. It is often wise to press  together with weights or to clamp together with handscrews boards that  show a tendency to warp, putting the two concave sides together. Then  the convex side is exposed and the board may straighten thus: Fig. 58.  By wrapping up small boards in paper or cloth in the intervals between  work on them, they may be kept straight until they are assembled.    [Illustration: Fig. 58. Clamping up Boards to Prevent Warping.]    Another precaution to take is to be sure to plane both sides of a  board if either is planed, especially if the board has been exposed to  air-drying for some time.      WOOD MEASUREMENTS.    Lumber is a general term for all kinds of sawn wood. Logs may be sawn  into timber, that is, beams and joists, into planks, which are 2\" to  4\" thick, or into boards which are from 1/4\" to 1-3/4\" thick. These  may be resawn into special sizes.    Lumber is measured by the superficial foot, which is a board 1\" thick,  12\" wide, and 12\" long, so that a board 1\" thick, (or 7/8\" dressed) 6\"  wide and 12' 0\" long, measures 6' B. M. (board measure). Boards 1\"  or more thick are sold by the \"board foot\" which is equivalent to 12\"  square and 1\" thick. Boards less than 1\" thick are sold by the square  foot, face measure. Dressed lumber comes in sizes 1/8\" less than sawn  lumber. Regular sizes are:          5/8\" dressed to   1/2\"          3/4\" dressed to   5/8\"        1\"     dressed to   7/8\"        1-1/4\" dressed to 1-1/8\"        1-1/2\" dressed to 1-3/8\"        2\"     dressed to 1-7/8\"    Any of these may be dressed down to thinner boards, or resawn on a  special band-saw.    In ordering it is common to give the dimensions wanted, in the order  of thickness, width, and length, because that is the order in which  dimensions are gotten out.

Again you may say that any attempt at fixing the relative value of  silver and gold is, and always has been, a great mistake. Still it  shows how closely the world is held together, and how, for good or for  evil, we are what we are, not so much by ourselves as by the toil and  moil of those who came before us, our true intellectual ancestors,  whatever the blood may have been composed of that ran through their  veins, or the bones which formed the rafters of their skulls.    And if it is true, with regard to religion, that no one could  understand it and appreciate its full purport without knowing its  origin and growth, that is, without knowing something of what the  cuneiform inscriptions of Mesopotamia, the hieroglyphic and hieratic  texts of Egypt, and the historical monuments of Phoenicia and Persia  can alone reveal to us, it is equally true with regard to all the  other elements that constitute the whole of our intellectual life. If  we are Jewish or Semitic in our religion, we are _Greek_ in our  philosophy, _Roman_ in our politics, and _Saxon_ in our morality; and  it follows that a knowledge of the history of the Greeks, Romans, and  Saxons, or of the flow of civilization from Greece to Italy, and  through Germany to these isles, forms an essential element in what is  called a liberal, that is, an historical and rational education.    But then it might be said, Let this be enough. Let us know by all  means all that deserves to be known about our real spiritual ancestors  in the great historical kingdoms of the world; let us be grateful for  all we have inherited from Egyptians, Babylonians, Phoenicians,  Jews, Greeks, Romans, and Saxons. But why bring in India? Why add a  new burden to what every man has to bear already, before he can call  himself fairly educated? What have we inherited from the dark dwellers  on the Indus and the Ganges, that we should have to add their royal  names and dates and deeds to the archives of our already overburdened  memory?    There is some justice in this complaint. The ancient inhabitants of  India are not our intellectual ancestors in the same direct way as  Jews, Greeks, Romans, and Saxons are; but they represent,  nevertheless, a collateral branch of that family to which we belong by  language, that is, by thought, and their historical records extend in  some respects so far beyond all other records and have been preserved  to us in such perfect and such legible documents, that we can learn  from them lessons which we can learn nowhere else, and supply missing  links in our intellectual ancestry far more important than that  missing link (which we can well afford to miss), the link between Ape  and Man.    I am not speaking as yet of the literature of India as it is, but of  something far more ancient, the language of India, or Sanskrit. No one  supposes any longer that Sanskrit was the common source of Greek,  Latin, and Anglo-Saxon. This used to be said, but it has long been  shown that Sanskrit is only a collateral branch of the same stem from  which spring Greek, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon; and not only these, but  all the Teutonic, all the Celtic, all the Slavonic languages, nay, the  languages of Persia and Armenia also.    What, then, is it that gives to Sanskrit its claim on our attention,  and its supreme importance in the eyes of the historian?    First of all, its antiquity--for we know Sanskrit at an earlier period  than Greek. But what is far more important than its merely  chronological antiquity is the antique state of preservation in which  that Aryan language has been handed down to us. The world had known  Latin and Greek for centuries, and it was felt, no doubt, that there  was some kind of similarity between the two. But how was that  similarity to be explained? Sometimes Latin was supposed to give the  key to the formation of a Greek word, sometimes Greek seemed to betray  the secret of the origin of a Latin word. Afterward, when the ancient  Teutonic languages, such as Gothic and Anglo-Saxon, and the ancient  Celtic and Slavonic languages too, came to be studied, no one could  help seeing a certain family likeness among them all. But how such a  likeness between these languages came to be, and how, what is far more  difficult to explain, such striking differences too between these  languages came to be, remained a mystery, and gave rise to the most  gratuitous theories, most of them, as you know, devoid of all  scientific foundation. As soon, however, as Sanskrit stepped into the  midst of these languages, there came light and warmth and mutual  recognition. They all ceased to be strangers, and each fell of its own  accord into its right place. Sanskrit was the eldest sister of them  all, and could tell of many things which the other members of the  family had quite forgotten. Still, the other languages too had each  their own tale to tell; and it is out of all their tales together that  a chapter in the human mind has been put together which, in some  respects, is more important to us than any of the other chapters, the  Jewish, the Greek, the Latin, or the Saxon.    The process by which that ancient chapter of history was recovered is  very simple. Take the words which occur in the same form and with the  same meaning in all the seven branches of the Aryan family, and you  have in them the most genuine and trustworthy records in which to read  the thoughts of our true ancestors, before they had become Hindus, or  Persians, or Greeks, or Romans, or Celts, or Teutons, or Slaves. Of  course, some of these ancient charters may have been lost in one or  other of these seven branches of the Aryan family, but even then, if  they are found in six, or five, or four, or three, or even two only of  its original branches, the probability remains, unless we can prove a  later historical contact between these languages, that these words  existed before the great _Aryan Separation_. If we find _agni_,  meaning fire, in Sanskrit, and _ignis_, meaning fire, in Latin, we may  safely conclude that _fire_ was known to the undivided Aryans, even if  no trace of the same name of fire occurred anywhere else. And why?  Because there is no indication that Latin remained longer united with  Sanskrit than any of the other Aryan languages, or that Latin could  have borrowed such a word from Sanskrit, after these two languages had  once become distinct. We have, however, the Lithuanian _ugnis_, and  the Scottish _ingle_, to show that the Slavonic and possibly the  Teutonic languages also, knew the same word for fire, though they  replaced it in time by other words. Words, like all other things, will  die, and why they should live on in one soil and wither away and  perish in another, is not always easy to say. What has become of  _ignis_, for instance, in all the Romance languages? It has withered  away and perished, probably because, after losing its final  unaccentuated syllable, it became awkward to pronounce; and another  word, _focus_, which in Latin meant fireplace, hearth, altar, has  taken its place.    Suppose we wanted to know whether the ancient Aryans before their  separation knew the mouse: we should only have to consult the principal  Aryan dictionaries, and we should find in Sanskrit _mush_, in Greek  [Greek: mus], in Latin _mus_, in Old Slavonic myse, in Old High German  _mus_, enabling us to say that, at a time so distant from us that we  feel inclined to measure it by Indian rather than by our own chronology,  the mouse was known, that is, was named, was conceived and recognized as  a species of its own, not to be confounded with any other vermin.    And if we were to ask whether the enemy of the mouse, the _cat_, was  known at the same distant time, we should feel justified in saying  decidedly, No. The cat is called in Sanskrit mar_g_ara and vi_d_ala.  In Greek and Latin the words usually given as names of the cat,  [Greek: _galee_] and [Greek: _ailouros_], _mustella_ and _feles_,  did not originally signify the tame cat, but the weasel or marten. The  name for the real cat in Greek was [Greek: _katta_], in Latin  _catus_, and these words have supplied the names for cat in all the  Teutonic, Slavonic, and Celtic languages. The animal itself, so far as  we know at present, came to Europe from Egypt, where it had been  worshipped for centuries and tamed; and as this arrival probably dates  from the fourth century A.D., we can well understand that no common  name for it could have existed when the Aryan nations separated.[15]    In this way a more or less complete picture of the state of  civilization, previous to the Aryan Separation, can be and has been  reconstructed, like a mosaic put together with the fragments of  ancient stones; and I doubt whether, in tracing the history of the  human mind, we shall ever reach to a lower stratum than that which is  revealed to us by the converging rays of the different Aryan  languages.    Nor is that all; for even that Proto-Aryan language, as it has been  reconstructed from the ruins scattered about in India, Greece, Italy,  and Germany, is clearly the result of a long, long process of thought.  One shrinks from chronological limitations when looking into such  distant periods of life. But if we find Sanskrit as a perfect literary  language, totally different from Greek and Latin, 1500 B.C., where can  those streams of Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin meet, as we trace them  back to their common source? And then, when we have followed these  mighty national streams back to their common meeting-point, even then  that common language looks like a rock washed down and smoothed for  ages by the ebb and flow of thought. We find in that language such a  compound, for instance, as"]]]
