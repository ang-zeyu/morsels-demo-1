Paralleling the rise of Jim Crow and legalized segregation   (p. 005)  in much of America was the cutback in the number of black sailors, who  by 1909 were mostly in the galley and the engine room. In contrast to  their high percentage of the ranks in the Civil War and Spanish-American  War, only 6,750 black sailors, including twenty-four women reservists  (yeomanettes), served in World War I; they constituted 1.2 percent of  the Navy's total enlistment.[1-4] Their service was limited chiefly to  mess duty and coal passing, the latter becoming increasingly rare as  the fleet changed from coal to oil.

(_Frederick Remington's 1888  sketch._)]    When postwar enlistment was resumed in 1923, the Navy recruited  Filipino stewards instead of Negroes, although a decade later it  reopened the branch to black enlistment. Negroes quickly took  advantage of this limited opportunity, their numbers rising from 441  in 1932 to 4,007 in June 1940, when they constituted 2.3 percent of  the Navy's 170,000 total.[1-5] Curiously enough, because black     (p. 006)  reenlistment in combat or technical specialties had never been barred,  a few black gunner's mates, torpedomen, machinist mates, and the like  continued to serve in the 1930's.                       [Footnote 1-5: Memo, H. A. Badt, Bureau of                     Navigation, for Officer in Charge, Public                     Relations, 24 Jul 40, sub: Negroes in U.S. Navy,                     Nav-641, Records of the Bureau of Naval Personnel                     (hereafter BuPersRecs).]    Although the Army's racial policy differed from the Navy's, the  resulting limited, separate service for Negroes proved similar. The  laws of 1866 and 1869 that guaranteed the existence of four black  Regular Army regiments also institutionalized segregation, granting  federal recognition to a system racially separate and theoretically  equal in treatment and opportunity a generation before the Supreme  Court sanctioned such a distinction in _Plessy_ v. _Ferguson_.[1-6] So  important to many in the black community was this guaranteed existence  of the four regiments that had served with distinction against the  frontier Indians that few complained about segregation. In fact, as  historian Jack Foner has pointed out, black leaders sometimes  interpreted demands for integration as attempts to eliminate black  soldiers altogether.[1-7]                       [Footnote 1-6: 163 U.S. 537 (1896). In this 1896 case                     concerning segregated seating on a Louisiana                     railroad, the Supreme Court ruled that so long as                     equality of accommodation existed, segregation                     could not in itself be considered discriminatory                     and therefore did not violate the equal rights                     provision of the Fourteenth Amendment. This                     \"separate but equal\" doctrine would prevail in                     American law for more than half a century.]                       [Footnote 1-7: Foner, _Blacks and the Military in                     American History_, p. 66.]    The Spanish-American War marked a break with the post-Civil War  tradition of limited recruitment. Besides the 3,339 black regulars,  approximately 10,000 black volunteers served in the Army during    (p. 007)  the conflict. World War I was another exception, for Negroes made up  nearly 11 percent of the Army's total strength, some 404,000 officers  and men.[1-8] The acceptance of Negroes during wartime stemmed from  the Army's pressing need for additional manpower. Yet it was no means  certain in the early months of World War I that this need for men  would prevail over the reluctance of many leaders to arm large groups  of Negroes. Still remembered were the 1906 Brownsville affair, in  which men of the 25th Infantry had fired on Texan civilians, and the  August 1917 riot involving members of the 24th Infantry at Houston,  Texas.[1-9] Ironically, those idealistic impulses that had operated in  earlier wars were operating again in this most Jim Crow of  administrations.[1-10] Woodrow Wilson's promise to make the world safe  for democracy was forcing his administration to admit Negroes to the  Army. Although it carefully maintained racially separate draft calls,  the National Army conscripted some 368,000 Negroes, 13.08 percent of  all those drafted in World War I.[1-11]                       [Footnote 1-8: Ulysses Lee, _The Employment of Negro                     Troops_, United States Army in World War II                     (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1966), p.                     5.

Once again  Negroes were called on to perform a number of vital though unskilled  jobs, such as construction work, most notably in sixteen specially  formed pioneer infantry regiments. But they also served as frontline  combat troops in the all-black 92d and 93d Infantry Divisions, the  latter serving with distinction among the French forces.    Established by law and tradition and reinforced by the Army staff's  conviction that black troops had not performed well in combat,  segregation survived to flourish in the postwar era.[1-12] The familiar  practice of maintaining a few black units was resumed in the Regular  Army, with the added restriction that Negroes were totally excluded  from the Air Corps. The postwar manpower retrenchments common to all  Regular Army units further reduced the size of the remaining black  units. By June 1940 the number of Negroes on active duty stood at  approximately 4,000 men, 1.5 percent of the Army's total, about the  same proportion as Negroes in the Navy.[1-13]                       [Footnote 1-12: The development of post-World War I                     policy is discussed in considerable detail in Lee,                     _Employment of Negro Troops_, Chapters I and II.

The evening was serene, the air refreshing, the sky clear, and the  flowers exhaled their fragrance; the beams of the declining sun, whose  mild splendour reposed on the summit of the mountain, shed a glow of  ruddy light over its green declivity and the white flocks sporting upon  it; no sounds were audible save the murmurs of the Four Fountains, and  the reeds and voices of shepherds calling to each other from different  eminences.    The lovely innocents proceeding to the destined sacrifice added not a  little to the hilarity of the scene; they approached the plain full of  sportiveness, some coursing butterflies, others culling flowers, or  picking up the shining little pebbles that attracted their notice.  At  intervals they nimbly started from each other, for the sake of being  caught again, and mutually imparting a thousand caresses.    The dreadful chasm at whose bottom the portal of ebony was placed began  to appear at a distance; it looked like a black streak that divided the  plain.  Morakanabad and his companions took it for some work which the  Caliph had ordered; unhappy men! little did they surmise for what it was  destined.    Vathek, not liking they should examine it too nearly, stopped the  procession, and ordered a spacious circle to be formed on this side, at  some distance from the accursed chasm.  The body-guard of eunuchs was  detached to measure out the lists intended for the games, and prepare  ringles for the lines to keep off the crowd.  The fifty competitors were  soon stripped, and presented to the admiration of the spectators the  suppleness and grace of their delicate limbs; their eyes sparkled with a  joy which those of their fond parents reflected.  Every one offered  wishes for the little candidate nearest his heart, and doubted not of his  being victorious; a breathless suspense awaited the contest of these  amiable and innocent victims.    The Caliph, awaiting himself of the first moment to retire from the  crowd, advanced towards the chasm, and there heard, yet not without  shuddering, the voice of the Indian, who, gnashing his teeth, eagerly  demanded: \"Where are they? where are they? perceivest thou not how my  mouth waters?\"    \"Relentless Giaour!\" answered Vathek, with emotion, \"can nothing content  thee but the massacre of these lovely victims!  Ah! wert thou to behold  their beauty it must certainly move thy compassion.\"    \"Perdition on thy compassion, babbler!\" cried the Indian.  \"Give them me,  instantly give them, or my portal shall be closed against thee for ever!\"    \"Not so loudly,\" replied the Caliph, blushing.    \"I understand thee,\" returned the Giaour, with the grin of an ogre; \"thou  wantest to summon up more presence of mind; I will for a moment forbear.\"    During this exquisite dialogue the games went forward with all alacrity,  and at length concluded just as the twilight began to overcast the  mountains.  Vathek, who was still standing on the edge of the chasm,  called out, with all his might: \"Let my fifty little favourites approach  me separately, and let them come in the order of their success.  To the  first I will give my diamond bracelet, to the second my collar of  emeralds, to the third my aigret of rubies, to the fourth my girdle of  topazes, and to the rest each a part of my dress, even down to my  slippers.\"    This declaration was received with reiterated acclamations, and all  extolled the liberality of a prince who would thus strip himself for the  amusement of his subjects and the encouragement of the rising generation.    The Caliph in the meantime undressed himself by degrees, and, raising his  arm as high as he was able, made each of the prizes glitter in the air;  but whilst he delivered it with one hand to the child, who sprang forward  to receive it, he with the other pushed the poor innocent into the gulf,  where the Giaour, with a sullen muttering, incessantly repeated, \"More!  more!\"    This dreadful device was executed with so much dexterity that the boy who  was approaching him remained unconscious of the fate of his forerunner;  and as to the spectators, the shades of evening, together with their  distance, precluded them from perceiving any object distinctly.  Vathek,  having in this manner thrown in the last of the fifty, and expecting that  the Giaour on receiving them would have presented the key, already  fancied himself as great as Soliman, and consequently above being  amenable for what he had done: when, to his utter amazement, the chasm  closed, and the around became as entire as the rest of the plain.    No language could express his rage and despair.  He execrated the perfidy  of the Indian, loaded him with the most infamous invectives, and stamped  with his foot as resolving to be heard; he persisted in this demeanour  till his strength failed him, and then fell on the earth like one void of  sense.  His vizirs and grandees, who were nearer than the rest, supposed  him at first to be sitting on the grass at play with their amiable  children; but at length, prompted by doubt, they advanced towards the  spot, and found the Caliph alone, who wildly demanded what they wanted.    \"Our children! our children!\" cried they.    \"It is assuredly pleasant,\" said he, \"to make me accountable for  accidents; your children while at play fell from the precipice that was  here, and I should have experienced their fate had I not been saved by a  sudden start back.\"    At these words the fathers of the fifty boys cried out aloud, the mothers  repeated their exclamations an octave higher, whilst the rest, without  knowing the cause, soon drowned the voices of both with still louder  lamentations of their own.    \"Our Caliph,\" said they--and the report soon circulated--\"Our Caliph has  played us this trick to gratify his accursed Giaour.  Let us punish him  for his perfidy! let us avenge ourselves! let us avenge the blood of the  innocent! let us throw this cruel prince into the gulf that is near, and  let his name be mentioned no more!\"    At this rumour and these menaces, Carathis, full of consternation,  hastened to Morakanabad, and said: \"Vizir, you have lost two beautiful  boys, and must necessarily be the most afflicted of fathers, but you are  virtuous; save your master.\"    \"I will brave every hazard,\" replied the vizir, \"to rescue him from his  present danger, but afterwards will abandon him to his fate.  Bababalouk,\" continued he, \"put yourself at the head of your eunuchs;  disperse the mob, and, if possible, bring back this unhappy prince to his  palace.\"  Bababalouk and his fraternity, felicitating each other in a low  voice on their disability of ever being fathers, obeyed the mandate of  the vizir; who, seconding their exertions to the utmost of his power, at  length accomplished his generous enterprise, and retired as he resolved,  to lament at his leisure.    No sooner had the Caliph re-entered his palace than Carathis commanded  the doors to be fastened; but, perceiving the tumult to be still violent,  and hearing the imprecations which resounded from all quarters, she said  to her son: \"Whether the populace be right or wrong, it behoves you to  provide for your safety; let us retire to your own apartment, and from  thence through the subterranean passage, known only to ourselves, into  your tower; there, with the assistance of the mutes who never leave it,  we may be able to make some resistance.  Bababalouk, supposing us to be  still in the palace, will guard its avenues for his own sake; and we  shall soon find, without the counsels of that blubberer Morakanabad, what  expedient may be the best to adopt.\"    Vathek, without making the least reply, acquiesced in his mother's  proposal, and repeated as he went: \"Nefarious Giaour! where art thou!  hast thou not yet devoured those poor children? where are thy sabres? thy  golden key? thy talismans?\"    Carathis, who guessed from these interrogations a part of the truth, had  no difficulty to apprehend in getting at the whole, as soon as he should  be a little composed in his tower.  This princess was so far from being  influenced by scruples that she was as wicked as woman could be, which is  not saying a little, for the sex pique themselves on their superiority in  every competition.  The recital of the Caliph, therefore, occasioned  neither terror nor surprise to his mother; she felt no emotion but from  the promises of the Giaour, and said to her son: \"This Giaour, it must be  confessed, is somewhat sanguinary in his taste, but the terrestrial  powers are always terrible; nevertheless, what the one hath promised and  the others can confer will prove a sufficient indemnification; no crimes  should be thought too dear for such a reward! forbear then to revile the  Indian; you have not fulfilled the conditions to which his services are  annexed; for instance, is not a sacrifice to the subterranean Genii  required? and should we not be prepared to offer it as soon as the tumult  is subsided?  This charge I will take on myself, and have no doubt of  succeeding by means of your treasures, which, as there are now so many  others in store, may without fear be exhausted.\"    Accordingly the princess, who possessed the most consummate skill in the  art of persuasion, went immediately back through the subterranean  passage; and presenting herself to the populace, from a window of the  palace, began to harangue them with all the address of which she was  mistress, whilst Bababalouk showered money from both hands amongst the  crowd, who by these united means were soon appeased; every person retired  to his home, and Carathis returned to the tower.    Prayer at break of day was announced, when Carathis and Vathek"]]]
