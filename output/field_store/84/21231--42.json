Land was apparently cheap at that time, for trustworthy authorities  declare that it was purchasable at from a farthing to a penny per  acre.    The area of the Transvaal before the Boers began to migrate there  has been eloquently described as the hunter's Arcadia. Mr. Gordon  Cumming gives a graphic account of the scene:--    \"It was truly a fair and boundless prospect. Beautifully wooded  plains and mountains stretched away on every side to an amazing  distance, until the vision was lost among the faint blue outlines of  the distant mountain ranges. Throughout all this country, and vast  tracts beyond, I had the satisfaction to reflect that a never-ending  succession of herds of every species of noble game which the hunter  need desire pastured there in undisturbed security; and as I gazed I  felt that it was all my own, and that I at length possessed the  undisputed sway over a forest, in comparison with which the tame and  herded narrow bounds of the wealthiest European sportsman sink into  utter insignificance.\"    The number of elephants and lesser game bagged by Mr. Gordon Cumming  after this touching meditation fully bore out his hopes.    But the most interesting account of the Transvaal, before the  invasion of white men, is to be found in Captain William Cornwallis  Harris's account of his expedition into the interior of South Africa  in the years 1836 and 1837. He paints the new country in colours  lively and alluring:--    \"Instead of the dreary waste over which we had lately passed, we  might now imagine ourselves in an extensive park. A lawn, level as a  billiard-table, was everywhere spread with a soft carpet of  luxuriant green grass, spangled with flowers, and shaded by  spreading _mokaalas_--a large species of acacia which forms the  favourite food of the giraffe. The gaudy yellow blossoms with which  these remarkable trees were covered yielded an aromatic and  overpowering perfume--while small troops of striped quaggas, or wild  asses, and of brindled gnoos ... enlivened the scene.    \"I turned off the road,\" he continues, \"in pursuit of a troop of  brindled gnoos, and presently came upon another, which was followed  by a third still larger--then by a vast herd of zebras, and again by  more gnoos, with sassaybys and hartebeests pouring down from every  quarter, until the landscape literally presented the appearance of a  moving mass of game.\"    Further on he describes the extensive and romantic valley of the  Limpopo, \"which strongly contrasts with its own solitude, and with  the arid lands which must be traversed to arrive within its limits;  Dame Nature has doubtless been unusually lavish of her gifts. A bold  mountain landscape is chequered by innumerable rivulets abounding in  fish, and watering a soil rich in luxurious vegetation. Forests,  producing timber of the finest growth, are tenanted by a multitude  of birds, which, if not generally musical, are all gorgeously  attired; and the meadows throughout are decked with blossoming  geraniums, and with an endless profusion of the gayest flowers,  fancifully distributed in almost artificial _parterres_. Let the  foreground of this picture, which is by no means extravagantly  drawn, be filled in by the animal creation roaming in a state of  undisturbed freedom, such as I have attempted to describe, and this  hunter's paradise will surely not require to be coloured by the  feelings of an enthusiastic sportsman to stand out in striking  relief from amongst the loveliest spots in the universe.\"    A recent traveller discourses pathetically over the changes that  have come over the country, which at that time was described as \"the  Zoological Gardens turned out to graze.\" He says the lawyer and  financier thrive where in recent years the lion and the leopard  fought for food, and townships have sprung up on spots where living  Boers have formerly shot big game.    As an instance of the truth of this lament, one may make some  quotations from Mr. Campbell's valuable article, \"The Transvaal, Old  and New.\" He says, \"The advent of British folk and British gold and  brains led to a change, and land, by reason of British purchases,  became more valuable, and beacons and boundaries became necessary.\"  Here we may see the thin end of the wedge. We may picture the first  lawyer and the first financier advancing with Arcadia parchment and  bank-note in hand.    The Boers steadily sold their best and surplus lands, and these the  British as steadily bought, till the value rose from their original  price of one penny an acre to half-a-crown, and then five shillings.  Subsequently, in many cases, as much as ten, and even twenty  shillings an acre was offered for ordinary raw arable land. But of  that time too much has to be said to be recounted here.      THE BOER CHARACTER    In discussing the events of the past with a view to obtaining light  on the development of the present, it is needful, and indeed just,  to inquire into the character of the Boers as a race. It is a  complex character, with multitudinous lights and shades, so subtle  and yet so marked, that they are difficult to define accurately. It  is therefore necessary that the opinions of many writers on the  subject of the Boer temperament should be taken--of writers who have  made it their business to look upon the subject with the eye of the  historian rather than the eye of the advocate, and who may be  trusted to have given their verdict without passion or favour.    But regarding one fact connected with the case, all writers of  practical experience are inclined to agree. They declare that the  Boer of the past was a very much finer fellow than the Boer of the  present--finer morally and physically; and that in his obstinate  determination to resist the march of progress he has allowed himself  to suffer deterioration. The reason for this deterioration is not  difficult to comprehend. In the first place, as we all know, nothing  in creation stands still. We must advance, or we go back. Both in  moral and in mental qualities we must maintain our vitality, or  practically ossify!    The Boer, from having been essentially a sporting man and a free and  a robust tiller of the soil, has come under the influence of  schemers, who have played upon his natural avarice, and polished his  inherent cunning, till these qualities have expanded to the  detriment of those earlier qualities for which the Boer of to-day  still gets credit, but which are fast dying out of the national  character.    In one respect there has been little change. In the matter of his  native piety he remains as he was. The Boer, if one may use a phrase  recently coined by Lord Rosebery, is an \"Old Testament Christian.\"  No one can describe his race better than the writer who says of the  original settlers in 1652, that \"they are a mixture in religion of  the old Israelite and the Scotch Covenanter.\" There is some question  about Boer hypocrisy, and Dr. Theal says on the subject, \"Where side  by side with expressions of gratitude to the Creator are found  schemes for robbing and enslaving natives, the genuineness of their  religion may be doubted.\" But it must be remembered that in bygone  centuries the world's morality differed much from that of the  present day, and therefore the Boer, who has not progressed in  proportion to the world at large, can scarcely be judged by the  ethics of the world at large. To be just, we must look at him as a  being apart, and place him always in the frame of the seventeenth  century. Some historians declare that the Boer borrowed from the  French refugees much religious sentiment. Other authorities--and  these, considering the Boer disinclination to expansion, seem to be  right--declare that under the French influence he deteriorated.    [Illustration: COLONEL of the 10th HUSSARS.    (H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES.)    Photo by Gregory & Co., London.]    He was by nature bloodthirsty and cruel, but these qualities always  found for themselves a comfortable apology in the Old Testament. The  Boer prided himself on his likeness to the Israelite of old, and his  enemies to the Canaanite, whom it was doing God a service to  destroy. He kept all the rites of the Church with rigid punctuality.  He partook of the Communion (the Nachtmaal) once every three months,  and the whole community gathered together from great distances to  share it. The observances were made the occasion for rejoicing and  merrymaking, for the holding of fairs, the transfer of cattle,  the driving of bargains in hide or ivory, or other goods necessary  to traders. He has been described by a friend of his people \"as,  according to his own lights, a citizen pioneer, a rough,  God-fearing, honest, homely, uneducated Philistine.\"    The opinion of his ancient enemy, Cetchwayo, differs, however, from  this estimate. Sir Frederick Godson has told us that this potentate  informed his brother, who was his captor, that the Boers were \"a  mean, treacherous people, people who trusted no one, not even each  other, and their word was not to be trusted.\" He had had ample  opportunities of forming a judgment by experience. And there are  many of us nowadays who are inclined to agree with him. Cetchwayo  further asserted that \"the British were making the greatest mistake  they ever made in befriending them; for if they had not rescued the  Boers from him, he would very soon have eaten them all up.\"    As regards the military organisation of the Boers, it may be  described as similar to that of the Republic of Greece or that of  mediaeval England. Every man, from the age of sixteen to sixty,  considered himself a soldier. Every man, when the country demanded  his services, was ready to get under arms--to protect his hearth and  home in the face of a common enemy.

I pointed up and he said 'No--no--no!' in a  sort of helpless trill. And we couldn't get any help from the natives.  They paid no attention at all, except to assure us they were  friends--ouch!    \"Lord! I don't know how many hours or days we wandered around there! I  slept twice from sheer exhaustion; Tweel never seemed to need sleep. We  tried following only the upward corridors, but they'd run uphill a ways  and then curve downwards. The temperature in that damned ant hill was  constant; you couldn't tell night from day and after my first sleep I  didn't know whether I'd slept one hour or thirteen, so I couldn't tell  from my watch whether it was midnight or noon.    \"We saw plenty of strange things. There were machines running in some of  the corridors, but they didn't seem to be doing anything--just wheels  turning. And several times I saw two barrel-beasts with a little one  growing between them, joined to both.\"    \"Parthenogenesis!\" exulted Leroy. \"Parthenogenesis by budding like _les  tulipes_!\"    \"If you say so, Frenchy,\" agreed Jarvis. \"The things never noticed us at  all, except, as I say, to greet us with 'We are v-r-r-riends! Ouch!'  They seemed to have no home-life of any sort, but just scurried around  with their pushcarts, bringing in rubbish. And finally I discovered what  they did with it.    \"We'd had a little luck with a corridor, one that slanted upwards for a  great distance. I was feeling that we ought to be close to the surface  when suddenly the passage debouched into a domed chamber, the only one  we'd seen. And man!--I felt like dancing when I saw what looked like  daylight through a crevice in the roof.    \"There was a--a sort of machine in the chamber, just an enormous wheel  that turned slowly, and one of the creatures was in the act of dumping  his rubbish below it. The wheel ground it with a crunch--sand, stones,  plants, all into powder that sifted away somewhere. While we watched,  others filed in, repeating the process, and that seemed to be all. No  rhyme nor reason to the whole thing--but that's characteristic of this  crazy planet. And there was another fact that's almost too bizarre to  believe.    \"One of the creatures, having dumped his load, pushed his cart aside  with a crash and calmly shoved himself under the wheel! I watched him  being crushed, too stupefied to make a sound, and a moment later,  another followed him! They were perfectly methodical about it, too; one  of the cartless creatures took the abandoned pushcart.    \"Tweel didn't seem surprised; I pointed out the next suicide to him, and  he just gave the most human-like shrug imaginable, as much as to say,  'What can I do about it?' He must have known more or less about these  creatures.    \"Then I saw something else. There was something beyond the wheel,  something shining on a sort of low pedestal. I walked over; there was a  little crystal about the size of an egg, fluorescing to beat Tophet. The  light from it stung my hands and face, almost like a static discharge,  and then I noticed another funny thing. Remember that wart I had on my  left thumb? Look!\" Jarvis extended his hand. \"It dried up and fell  off--just like that! And my abused nose--say, the pain went out of it  like magic! The thing had the property of hard x-rays or gamma  radiations, only more so; it destroyed diseased tissue and left healthy  tissue unharmed!    \"I was thinking what a present _that'd_ be to take back to Mother Earth  when a lot of racket interrupted. We dashed back to the other side of  the wheel in time to see one of the pushcarts ground up. Some suicide  had been careless, it seems.    \"Then suddenly the creatures were booming and drumming all around us and  their noise was decidedly menacing. A crowd of them advanced toward us;  we backed out of what I thought was the passage we'd entered by, and  they came rumbling after us, some pushing carts and some not. Crazy  brutes! There was a whole chorus of 'We are v-r-r-riends! Ouch!' I  didn't like the 'ouch'; it was rather suggestive.    \"Tweel had his glass gun out and I dumped my water tank for greater  freedom and got mine. We backed up the corridor with the barrel-beasts  following--about twenty of them. Queer thing--the ones coming in with  loaded carts moved past us inches away without a sign.    \"Tweel must have noticed that. Suddenly, he snatched out that glowing  coal cigar-lighter of his and touched a cart-load of plant limbs. Puff!  The whole load was burning--and the crazy beast pushing it went right  along without a change of pace! It created some disturbance among our  'V-r-r-riends,' however--and then I noticed the smoke eddying and  swirling past us, and sure enough, there was the entrance!    \"I grabbed Tweel and out we dashed and after us our twenty pursuers. The  daylight felt like Heaven, though I saw at first glance that the sun was  all but set, and that was bad, since I couldn't live outside my  thermo-skin bag in a Martian night--at least, without a fire.    \"And things got worse in a hurry. They cornered us in an angle between  two mounds, and there we stood. I hadn't fired nor had Tweel; there  wasn't any use in irritating the brutes. They stopped a little distance  away and began their booming about friendship and ouches.    \"Then things got still worse! A barrel-brute came out with a pushcart  and they all grabbed into it and came out with handfuls of foot-long  copper darts--sharp-looking ones--and all of a sudden one sailed past my  ear--zing! And it was shoot or die then.    \"We were doing pretty well for a while. We picked off the ones next to  the pushcart and managed to keep the darts at a minimum, but suddenly  there was a thunderous booming of 'v-r-r-riends' and 'ouches,' and a  whole army of 'em came out of their hole.    \"Man! We were through and I knew it! Then I realized that Tweel wasn't.  He could have leaped the mound behind us as easily as not. He was  staying for me!    \"Say, I could have cried if there'd been time! I'd liked Tweel from the  first, but whether I'd have had gratitude to do what he was  doing--suppose I _had_ saved him from the first dream-beast--he'd done  as much for me, hadn't he? I grabbed his arm, and said 'Tweel,' and  pointed up, and he understood. He said, 'No--no--no, Tick!' and popped  away with his glass pistol.    \"What could I do? I'd be a goner anyway when the sun set, but I couldn't  explain that to him. I said, 'Thanks, Tweel. You're a man!' and felt  that I wasn't paying him any compliment at all. A man! There are mighty  few men who'd do that.    \"So I went 'bang' with my gun and Tweel went 'puff' with his, and the  barrels were throwing darts and getting ready to rush us, and booming  about being friends. I had given up hope. Then suddenly an angel dropped  right down from Heaven in the shape of Putz, with his under-jets  blasting the barrels into very small pieces!    \"Wow! I let out a yell and dashed for the rocket; Putz opened the door  and in I went, laughing and crying and shouting! It was a moment or so  before I remembered Tweel; I looked around in time to see him rising in  one of his nosedives over the mound and away.    \"I had a devil of a job arguing Putz into following! By the time we got  the rocket aloft, darkness was down; you know how it comes here--like  turning off a light. We sailed out over the desert and put down once or  twice. I yelled 'Tweel!' and yelled it a hundred times, I guess. We  couldn't find him; he could travel like the wind and all I got--or else  I imagined it--was a faint trilling and twittering drifting out of the  south. He'd gone, and damn it! I wish--I wish he hadn't!\"    The four men of the _Ares_ were silent--even the sardonic Harrison. At  last little Leroy broke the stillness.    \"I should like to see,\" he murmured.    \"Yeah,\" said Harrison. \"And the wart-cure. Too bad you missed that; it  might be the cancer cure they've been hunting for a century and a half.\"    \"Oh, that!\" muttered Jarvis gloomily. \"That's what started the fight!\"  He drew a glistening object from his pocket.    \"Here it is.\""]]]
