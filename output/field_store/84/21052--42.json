Dr. Krause returned to Johannesburg after this interview and  immediately set about making the necessary arrangements to carry out  his part of the bargain. A Proclamation was issued, calling upon all  armed burghers and other capable men to leave the town; all officials  were ordered to be in readiness the next day at the respective  offices, for the purpose of handing over their administration to their  successors.    Early the next morning Mr. William Shawe, the Deputy Sheriff, was  dispatched to Lord Roberts, with a formal letter, confirming the terms  of surrender agreed to at the above interview. This historical  document is, I believe, here printed for the first time and reads as  follows:                                                  \"JOHANNESBURG,                                                   \"_May 30th, 1900._      \"Lord Roberts,          \"Commander-in-Chief of Her            \"Majesty's troops in South Africa.        \"YOUR LORDSHIP,        \"Referring to the verbal interview I had with Your Lordship this      morning, with reference to the surrender of the town,      Johannesburg, I now wish to confirm the following in writing:        \"(a) That all officials and other Government employees will be      treated with the necessary respect and consideration. On their      behalf I can give Your Lordship the assurance, that until the      surrender is complete, everything will be done by them to      facilitate Your Lordship's work, in so far as their honour      allows.        \"(b) With reference to the protection of women and children      (including the women and children of Burghers on      Commando),--that these persons will not be molested by the      troops,--Your Lordship having already given the necessary      instructions in this connection.        \"(c) That property will be protected, also forage, except in so      far as military requirements necessitate it.        \"(d) That as regards the 13,000 Kaffirs still on the mines, the      necessary precautions will be taken by Your Lordship:--in this      respect the Special Mine Police corps, till now under my      command, will render Your Lordship all assistance.        \"(e) Enclosed I send Your Lordship a copy of a notice      distributed by me, which speaks for itself, and from which Your      Lordship will learn that all fighting and armed burghers have      been ordered to leave the town at once.        \"(f) It grieves me to have to inform Your Lordship, that      notwithstanding our arrangement, that no armed men would enter      the town till to-morrow at 10 o'clock, several armed persons      entered the town (evidently without Your Lordship's knowledge,      and contrary to instructions), and several of whom are under      arrest; one who attempted to disarm a burgher was wounded, and      is at present in the hospital here.        \"Finally, I must request Your Lordship not to enter the town      with too great a force (for reasons already communicated to Your      Lordship).

KRAUSE.                          \"Acting Special Commandant.\"            On the morning of May 31st, 1900, the sun rose in his bright winter  splendour--the sky was blue, and not a cloud appeared upon the  horizon. Mother Nature seemed to emphasise the darkness and bitterness  in the hearts of the staunch and free Republicans by her dazzling  brightness. The new era had dawned, heralding the victory of the  invading forces and giving practical proof of the old adage, \"Might is  right.\"    At about 10 o'clock Commandant Krause received a message from Lord  Roberts announcing his presence on the outskirts of the town (at  Denver) and expressing a desire that the Commandant should personally  come and meet and conduct him to the Government offices, there to hand  over the \"keys\" of the city. This request was complied with. The  British were then seen entering the town, headed by Lord Roberts, Lord  Kitchener, and Commandant Krause. On arrival at the Government offices  the different officials were presented to Lord Roberts, who requested  them to remain in office until they were relieved of their duties by  an English officer.    The surrender of the Golden City was an accomplished fact!        [Illustration: THE SURRENDER OF THE GOLDEN CITY]    In conclusion, and as a contrast to this terrible period for the  Republicans, I may here be permitted to publish a letter written by  Lord Roberts to Dr. Krause, which will show in what manner the Golden  City was previously administrated and afterwards handed over to the  British troops on May 31st, 1900.                                       \"ARMY HEAD-QUARTERS,                                       \"JOHANNESBURG,                                           \"_June 2nd, 1900._        \"DEAR DR. KRAUSE,        \"I desire to express to you how fully I appreciate the valuable      assistance you have afforded me in connection with the entry      into this town of the force under my command.        \"I recognise that you have had DIFFICULTIES OF NO ORDINARY      NATURE TO CONTEND WITH OF LATE, and any weakness in the      administration of the town and suburbs at such a juncture would      doubtless have been taken full advantage of by the disorderly      element which necessarily exists in an important mining      community. THANKS TO YOUR ENERGY AND VIGILANCE, ORDER AND      TRANQUILLITY HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, and I congratulate you      heartily on the result of your labours.        \"Permit me also to tender to you my personal thanks for the      great courtesy you have shown me since I first had the pleasure      of meeting you.                        \"Believe me to be,                          \"Yours truly,                              \"ROBERTS, F.M.\"                CHAPTER IV    MARTIAL LAW UNDER THE ENEMY      After her brothers' departure, described in Chapter I, Hansie fastened  her \"Vierkleur,\" a broad band of the Transvaal colours, round her hat,  and announced her intention of going into town to see the British  troops come in.    Her mother thought it a most unseemly proceeding, and declined to  accompany her wilful daughter, but the latter did not wish to miss  what she knew would become an historical event of great importance,  and rode away on her bicycle, accompanied by her faithful retriever,  Carlo.    The thought of the conspicuous band of ribbon round her hat, in green,  red, white, and blue, gave her a certain feeling of comfort and  satisfaction.    At least none of the friends she might chance to meet that day could  suspect her of being in town to _welcome_ the enemy.    The air was charged with the electricity of an excitement so tense, so  suppressed, that it struck her like some living force as she rode  through the thronged, though silent streets.    In the heart of the town, as she neared Government Square, a change  was noticeable--a change that she could not define until it was borne  in upon her that it originated in the attitude of the black and  coloured part of the community.    They had come out in their thousands--the streets literally seethed  with them, the remarkable part of this being that they were all on the  pavements, while their \"white brothers\" walked in the middle of the  road.    For the sake of the uninitiated I must explain that under the Boer  regime no black or coloured person was allowed on the pavements, nor  to be out at night, nor to walk about without a registered pass. There  was no \"black peril\" then.    This noisy, unlawful demonstration was an expression of joy on their  part at the prospect of that day being set free from Boer  restrictions, a short-lived joy, however, for they became so lawless  and overbearing that it was found necessary, within a very few days,  to re-enforce the Boer laws and regulations.           *       *       *       *       *    In perfect order, but weary unto death, the British troops marched in.  Thousands and thousands of soldiers in khaki, travel-stained,  footsore, and famished, sank to the ground, at a given command, in the  open square facing Government Buildings.    Some of them tried to eat of the rations they had with them, others,  too exhausted to eat, fell into a deep sleep almost at once, and one  old warrior, looking up into the face of the girl standing above him,  said, in a broken voice, \"Thank God, the war is over.\"    Hansie bent towards him and answered, in a voice vibrating with  passionate feeling, \"Tommy Atkins, _the war has just begun_.\"    He looked at her in puzzled surprise, and sighing heavily, closed his  eyes.    Ah, unknown soldier, did you in after years, I wonder, remember the  prophetic words spoken by the lips of a girl that day?    At three o'clock that afternoon the Union Jack was hoisted on  Government Buildings!    Those of my readers whose love of home, kindred, traditions,  ideals--patriotism--belong to other countries can draw a mental  picture of what a similar experience would mean to them. One day to be  full of hope that a beloved country and independence would be restored  to its people, the next with those hopes laid low in the dust,  shattered, destroyed for ever, by the sight of a small, unfamiliar  flag standing out against the blue sky.    In time of great shock or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20195"],[0,"Wood-Block Printing (#6)"],[1,"clearing proceeds in the same way,  but it is only necessary to clear a space of about an inch round each  form: the rest of the wood should be left standing. A section of the  printing surface of a colour block would be as follows:    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Section of colour-block. A. Colour  mass. B. Depression. C. Surface of Plank.]    When the register marks corresponding to these colour forms have also  been cut, and the paper washed off the blocks, the clear spaces may be  used for pasting down new key impressions for the smaller colour patches  and their corresponding register marks. In this way one side of a colour  plank may contain several different colour forms and sets of register  marks. As a rule the different colour patches would be printed  separately, though in some cases two colours may be printed at one  impression if they are small and have the same register marks.    When the blocks have been cut and cleared it is advisable to smooth  with sand-paper the edge of the depression where it meets the uncut  surface of the wood, otherwise this edge, if at all sharp, will mark the  print.    For any particulars about which one may be in doubt, the sets of blocks  at South Kensington Museum or in the Print Room at the British Museum  are available for examination. In one of the sets at the British Museum  it is interesting to see the temporary corrections that have been made  in the register marks during printing by means of little wooden plugs  stuck into the register notches.    In nearly all cases the Japanese blocks were made of cherry wood, but  planks of box are said to have been occasionally used for very fine  work.      ERRORS OF REGISTER    However exactly the register marks may be cut in a new set of blocks,  very puzzling errors occasionally arise while printing, especially if  the planks are of thin wood.    Some of the blocks are necessarily printed drier than others. For  instance, the key-block is printed with a very small amount of ink and  paste. Other blocks may be even drier, such as the blocks which print  small forms or details in a design. The blocks, however, which are used  for large masses of colour, or for gradated tones, are moistened over  the whole or a large part of the surface of the block, and if the wood  is thin, and not well mounted across the ends, the block soon expands  sufficiently to throw the register out. If the block is not mounted  across the ends there will also be a tendency to warp, and this will add  to the errors of register. But if the blocks are of fairly thick wood,  and well mounted, the register will remain very exact indeed.    Usually the key-block is printed first. If the subsequent blocks are not  in exact register the error is noticeable at once, and slight  adjustments may be made for its correction. But in cases where the  key-block is printed last (as sometimes is necessary) each colour block  must be tested before a batch of prints is passed over it. For this  purpose the first few prints of every batch should receive a faint  impression of the key-block, so that the register of the colour  impression may be verified before proceeding with the whole batch.    If these precautions are taken, and the entire set of blocks kept as  nearly as possible in the same conditions of dryness or moisture, all  difficulties of register in printing will be easily overcome.    When cutting a new set of blocks there is another possible source of  error which needs to be carefully guarded against. Most of the work in  designing a new print is necessarily spent in planning and cutting the  key-block, which may occupy a considerable time, especially if other  work has to be carried on as well. If new wood is used, or wood that has  not been seasoned long indoors, it will dry and contract considerably  across the grain before the work is finished. Then, if newer planks are  prepared and cut up for the colour blocks, and impressions from the  key-block are pasted down on them for cutting, it will be found that, as  the newer wood of the colour-blocks goes on drying, it will shrink out  of register, and the colour impressions will not fit the line perfectly.  It is easy to fall into this difficulty, but there is no danger of it if  the planks from which the key-block and the colour-blocks are cut are  all equally seasoned and are in the same condition.          CHAPTER V           Preparation of Paper, Ink, Colour, and Paste for Printing      PAPER    The paper made by the Japanese from the inner bark of young shoots of  the mulberry and certain other plants of similar fibre is beyond all  others the best for wood-block printing. It is in itself a very  remarkable material, and is used in Japan for a great variety of  purposes, on account of the strength and toughness due to its long silky  fibre.    Paper of good quality for printing may be obtained directly from Japan,  or through trading agents dealing with Japan. A case of five reams would  be the smallest quantity obtainable directly, but it is by far the  cheapest and most satisfactory way of buying it. In smaller quantities  the paper is obtainable through many of the dealers in artists'  materials. Several kinds of this paper are made, but unsized sheets of a  quality similar to the print on page 95, and a thin Japanese tissue  paper are the two kinds required for printing in colour.    In its unsized state the paper is too absorbent for use, and it should  be sized freshly as needed for work. This is done by brushing a thin  solution of gelatine over the smooth surface of the sheets of paper.    A drawing-board rather larger than the sheets of paper, placed as shown  in fig. 17, with its lower edge resting on a basin of warm size, will be  found a convenient arrangement.    [Illustration: Plate VII. Impression of a portion of detail from a  Japanese woodblock (very nearly actual size).    (_To face page 48._)]    The sheet gelatine sold by grocers for cooking makes an excellent size.  Six of the thin sheets to a pint of water is a good strength.[3] The  gelatine is dissolved in hot water, but should not be boiled, as that  partially destroys the size. When dissolved, a little powdered alum  is also stirred in, about as much as will lie on a shilling to a pint of  water. The addition of the alum is important, as it acts as a mordant  and helps to make a better colour impression.    [3] See also p. 75.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Drawing of sizing of paper.]    In applying the size to the paper a four-inch broad flat paste brush is  used. The paper is laid on the slanting board and the size brushed  backward and forward across the paper from the upper end downward. Care  must be taken not to make creases in the paper, as these become  permanent. To avoid this the lower end of the sheet may be held with the  left hand and raised when necessary as the brush passes downwards. The  waste size will run down to the basin, but the paper need not be  flooded, nor should its surface be brushed unnecessarily, but it must be  fully and evenly charged with size. The sheet is then picked up by the  two upper corners (which may conveniently be kept unsized) and pinned at  each corner over a cord stretched across the workroom. The sheets are  left hanging until they are dry. The Japanese lay the paper on the  cord, letting the two halves of the sheet hang down equally on either  side.    The process of sizing and drying the sheets of paper is illustrated in a  print shown in the collection at the South Kensington Museum.    When the paper is quite dry it is taken down, and if required at once  for printing should be cut up into sheets of the size required, with  sufficient margin allowed to reach the register marks. It is best to cut  a gauge or pattern in cardboard for use in cutting the sheets to a  uniform size.    A few sheets of unsized paper are needed as damping sheets, one being  used to every three printing sheets. The damping sheets should be cut at  least an inch wider and longer than the printing sheets. Two wooden  boards are also required. The sheets of printing paper are kept between  these while damping before work.    To prepare for work, a damping sheet is taken and brushed over evenly  with water with a broad brush (like that used for sizing). The sheet  must not be soaked, but made thoroughly moist, evenly all over. It is  then laid on one of the two boards, and on it, with the printing side  (the smoother side) downward, are laid three of the sized sheets of  printing paper. On these another moist damping sheet is laid, and again  three dry sheets of printing paper, face downwards, and so on  alternately to the number of sheets of the batch to be printed. A board  is placed on the top of the pile.    The number of prints to be attempted at one printing will vary with the  kind of work and with the printer's experience. The printing may be  continued during three days, but if the paper is kept damp longer, there  is danger of mould and spotting. With work requiring delicate gradation  of colour and many separate block impressions twenty or thirty sheets  will be found sufficient for three days' hard work. The professional  printers of Japan, however, print batches of two hundred and three  hundred prints at a time, but in that case the work must become largely  mechanical.[4]    [4] See Chapter XIII for further experience on this point.    The batch of paper and damping sheets should remain between the boards  for at least half an hour when new sheets are being damped for the first  time. The damping sheets, all but the top and bottom ones, should then  be removed and the printing sheets left together between the boards for  some time before printing. An hour improves their condition very much,  the moisture spreading equally throughout the batch of sheets. Before  printing they should be quite flat and soft, but scarcely moist to the  touch. If the sheets are new, they may even be left"]]]
