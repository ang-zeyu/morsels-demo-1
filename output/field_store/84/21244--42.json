In all the colonies, though there were, of course,  variations of detail, it was substantially the same. It was founded in  every case upon Royal Charters granted at some time or other to the  planters by the English king. In every case there was a Governor, who  was assisted by some sort of elective assembly. The Governor was the  representative of the King and was nominated by him. The legislature was  in some form or other elected by the free citizens. The mode of election  and the franchise varied from colony to colony--Massachusetts at one  time based hers upon pew rents--but it was generally in harmony with the  feeling and traditions of the colonists. It was seldom that any friction  occurred between the King's representative and the burgesses, as they  were generally called. While the relations between the colonies and the  mother country remained tranquil the Governor had every motive for  pursuing a conciliatory policy. His personal comfort depended upon his  being popular in the only society which he could frequent. His repute  with the Home Government, if he valued it, was equally served by the  tranquillity and contentment of the dominion he ruled.    In fact, the American colonists, during the eighteenth century, enjoyed  what a simple society left to itself almost always enjoys, under  whatever forms--the substance of democracy. That fact must be  emphasized, because without a recognition of it the flaming response  which met the first proclamation of theoretic democracy would be  unintelligible. It is explicable only when we remember that to the  unspoiled conscience of man as man democracy will ever be the most  self-evident of truths. It is the complexity of our civilization that  blinds us to its self-evidence, teaching us to acquiesce in irrational  privilege as inevitable, and at last to see nothing strange in being  ruled by a class, whether of nobles or of mere parliamentarians. But the  man who looks at the world with the terrible eyes of his first innocence  can never see an unequal law as anything but an iniquity, or government  divorced from the general will as anything but usurpation.                                        CHAPTER II                          ARMS AND THE RIGHTS OF MAN      Such was roughly the position of the thirteen English colonies in North  America when in the year 1764, shortly after the conclusion of the Seven  Years' War, George Grenville, who had become the chief Minister of  George III. after the failure of Lord Bute, proposed to raise a revenue  from these colonies by the imposition of a Stamp Act.    The Stamp Act and the resistance it met mark so obviously the beginning  of the business which ended in the separation of the United States from  Great Britain that Grenville and the British Parliament have been  frequently blamed for the lightness of heart with which they entered  upon so momentous a course. But in fact it did not seem to them  momentous, nor is it easy to say why they should have thought it  momentous. It is certain that Grenville's political opponents, many of  whom were afterwards to figure as the champions of the colonists, at  first saw its momentousness as little as he. They offered to his  proposal only the most perfunctory sort of opposition, less than they  habitually offered to all his measures, good or bad.    And, in point of fact, there was little reason why a Whig of the type  and class that then governed England should be startled or shocked by a  proposal to extend the English system of stamping documents to the  English colonies. That Parliament had the legal right to tax the  colonies was not seriously questionable. Under the British Constitution  the power of King, Lords and Commons over the King's subjects was and is  absolute, and none denied that the colonists were the King's subjects.  They pleaded indeed that their charters did not expressly authorize such  taxation; but neither did they expressly exclude it, and on a strict  construction it would certainly seem that a power which would have  existed if there had been no charter remained when the charter was  silent.    It might further be urged that equity as well as law justified the  taxation of the colonies, for the expenditure which these taxes were  raised to meet was largely incurred in defending the colonies first  against the French and then against the Indians. The method of taxation  chosen was not new, neither had it been felt to be specially grievous.  Much revenue is raised in Great Britain and all European countries  to-day by that method, and there is probably no form of taxation at  which men grumble less. Its introduction into America had actually been  recommended on its merits by eminent Americans. It had been proposed by  the Governor of Pennsylvania as early as 1739. It had been approved at  one time by Benjamin Franklin himself. To-day it must seem to most of us  both less unjust and less oppressive than the Navigation Laws, which the  colonists bore without complaint.    As for the suggestion sometimes made that there was something  unprecedentedly outrageous about an English Parliament taxing people who  were unrepresented there, it is, in view of the constitution of that  Parliament, somewhat comic. If the Parliament of 1764 could only tax  those whom it represented, its field of taxation would be somewhat  narrow. Indeed, the talk about taxation without representation being  tyranny, however honestly it might be uttered by an American, could only  be conscious or unconscious hypocrisy in men like Burke, who were not  only passing their lives in governing and taxing people who were  unrepresented, but who were quite impenitently determined to resist any  attempt to get them represented even in the most imperfect fashion.    All this is true; and yet it is equally true that the proposed tax at  once excited across the Atlantic the most formidable discontent. Of this  discontent we may perhaps summarize the immediate causes as follows.  Firstly, no English minister or Parliament had, as a fact, ever before  attempted to tax the colonies. That important feature of the case  distinguished it from that of the Navigation Laws, which had  prescription on their side. Then, if the right to tax were once  admitted, no one could say how far it would be pushed. Under the  Navigation Laws the colonists knew just how far they were restricted,  and they knew that within the limits of such restrictions they could  still prosper. But if once the claim of the British Parliament to tax  were quietly accepted, it seemed likely enough that every British  Minister who had nowhere else to turn for a revenue would turn to the  unrepresented colonies, which would furnish supply after supply until  they were \"bled white.\" That was a perfectly sound, practical  consideration, and it naturally appealed with especial force to  mercantile communities like that of Boston.    But if we assume that it was the only consideration involved, we shall  misunderstand all that followed, and be quite unprepared for the  sweeping victory of a purely doctrinal political creed which brought  about the huge domestic revolution of which the breaking of the ties  with England was but an aspect. The colonists did feel it unjust that  they should be taxed by an authority which was in no way responsible to  them; and they so felt it because, as has already been pointed out, they  enjoyed in the management of their everyday affairs a large measure of  practical democracy. Therein they differed from the English, who, being  habitually governed by an oligarchy, did not feel it extraordinary that  the same oligarchy should tax them. The Americans for the most part  governed themselves, and the oligarchy came in only as an alien and  unnatural thing levying taxes. Therefore it was resisted.    The resistance was at first largely instinctive. The formulation of the  democratic creed which should justify it was still to come. Yet already  there were voices, especially in Virginia, which adumbrated the  incomparable phrases of the greatest of Virginians. Already Richard  Bland had appealed to \"the law of Nature and those rights of mankind  that flow from it.\" Already Patrick Henry had said, \"Give me liberty or  give me death!\"    It was but a foreshadowing of the struggle to come. In 1766 the  Rockingham Whigs, having come into power upon the fall of Grenville,  after some hesitation repealed the Stamp Act, reaffirming at the same  time the abstract right of Parliament to tax the colonies. America was  for the time quieted. There followed in England a succession of weak  Ministries, all, of course, drawn from the same oligarchical class, and  all of much the same political temper, but all at issue with each other,  and all more or less permanently at issue with the King. As a mere  by-product of one of the multitudinous intrigues to which this situation  gave rise, Charles Townshend, a brilliant young Whig orator who had  become Chancellor of the Exchequer, revived in 1768 the project of  taxing the American colonies. This was now proposed in the form of a  series of duties levied on goods exported to those colonies--the one  most obnoxious to the colonists and most jealously maintained by the  Ministers being a duty on tea. The Opposition had now learnt from the  result of the Stamp Act debate that American taxation was an excellent  issue on which to challenge the Ministry, and the Tea Tax became at once  a \"Party Question\"--that is, a question upon which the rival oligarchs  divided themselves into opposing groups.    Meanwhile in America the new taxes were causing even more exasperation  than the Stamp Act had caused--probably because they were more menacing  in their form, if not much more severe in their effect. At any rate, it  is significant that in the new struggle we find the commercial colony "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#6)"],[1,"band, are seen vascular bundles  forming a row and enclosing a large space of the ground tissue  consisting of only parenchyma. (See figs. 29 and 30.)    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum  ramosum x 24]    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Panicum ramosum. x 75    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Transverse section of the stem of Andropogon  caricosus. x 25]    The stem of _Panicum ramosum_ is semi-circular and somewhat flat on one  side. The epidermal cells alone are thickened. There is a broad well  developed continuous band of sclerenchyma, which is connected at regular  intervals with the epidermis by small vascular bundles. Another row of  vascular bundles lies just inside the sclerenchymatous ring and each of  these bundles is in contact with the band. Away from the ring lie a  number of bundles forming a series disposed in two irregular rings  around a broad portion of the ground tissue. (See figs. 31 and 32.)    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Andropogon caricosus. x 75    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Panicum Isachne. x 100    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    The stem of the grass _Andropogon caricosus_ is oval in outline, the  front being flat. The epidermal cells and those below and in contact  with them are thick-walled. The sclerenchymatous ring though present is  very narrow and not very conspicuous. It consists of one or two layers  of cells connecting a few vascular bundles forming the outermost set.  There is a series of vascular bundles inside the ring which surrounds a  large area of the ground tissue. Two isolated bundles, one in front and  another at the back of the ground tissue, are found. The cells of the  ground tissue lying just inside the vascular bundles are all very much  thickened. (See figs. 33 and 34.)    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--Transverse section of the stem of Eragrostis  interrupta. x 25]    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum  flavidum. x 15]    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Panicum flavidum. x 70    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    The stems of _Panicum Isachne_ and _Eragrostis interrupta_ are hollow.  The stem of the former is circular in outline in cross section, though  wavy. There is a sclerenchymatous ring close to the epidermis but  separated from it by a few layers of parenchyma. One set of bundles is  imbedded in the band, and another set just touches the inner border of  it. A third series is disposed around a fairly large amount of ground  tissue, which may or may not have a cavity in the centre. The stem of  _Eragrostis_ _interrupta_ has more or less the same structure, but the  cortex has air spaces here and there. Other minor differences may be  seen on referring to figs. 35 and 36.    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Panicum colonum. x 70    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    The stems of grasses growing in wet or marshy situations differ in  structure from those detailed above. As examples the stems of _Panicum  flavidum_, _Panicum colonum_, _Panicum Crus-galli_ and _Panicum  fluitans_ may be considered. The stem of _Panicum flavidum_ is broadly  ovate in cross section with a flat front and is more or less solid,  though occasionally the parenchymatous cells in the centre get broken.  Two rows of vascular bundles surround a fairly large amount of  parenchymatous cells of the ground tissue. There is a continuous ring of  sclerenchyma separated from the epidermis by a fairly broad cortex. The  cortex has a number of fairly large air-cavities separated by bands of  parenchymatous cells. Within the sclerenchymatous band lie small  vascular bundles at regular intervals just towards the cortex. A few  isolated bundles are in contact with the inner border. (See figs. 37 and  38.)    The stems of _Panicum colonum_, _Panicum stagninum_ and _Panicum  Crus-galli_ have in their centre in the ground tissue stellate cells  with air-cavities. This part is surrounded by a fairly broad portion of  parenchymatous cells in which are imbedded two rows of bundles. Outside  these bundles runs round the stem a narrow sclerenchymatous band with a  few bundles in it of which some touch it inside and others outside. Two  bundles are found by themselves in the tissue of stellate cells. In  _Panicum Crus-galli_ three or four bundles are met with amidst the  stellate cells.    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Panicum Crus-galli. x 70    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 41.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum  stagninum. x 10]    The cortex outside the band of sclerenchyma is full of air-cavities,  small and large. In _Panicum colonum_ the outline of the stem is  ellipsoidal with the front quite flat, and the cortex is narrow at the  sides and very broad in front and at the back. The sclerenchymatous ring  is circular in outline. The stem of _Panicum Crus-galli_ is broadly  ovoid and the cortex is uniformly broad. The epidermal cells as well as  the lower cells are thickened in the stems of _Panicum fluitans_ and  _Panicum Crus-galli_, but in the stems of _Panicum colonum_ and _Panicum  flavidum_ the epidermis alone is thickened. In the cortical portion  outside the sclerenchymatous band, small vascular bundles occur in the  stems of _Panicum colonum_, _Panicum Crus-galli_ and _Panicum fluitans_.  (See figs. 39, 40, 42 and 43.)    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum  fluitans. x 15]    [Illustration: Fig. 43.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Panicum fluitans. x 60    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle; 4. air-cavity; 5.  diaphragm.]    The stem of _Panicum fluitans_ is round in outline in the transverse  section and has a large cavity. Just close to the cavity and separated  from it by only one or two parenchymatous cells are found vascular  bundles forming a series. Outside this series of bundles lies a  sclerenchymatous band which is wavy, following the lower edges of the  large air-cavities. One series of bundles is connected with this  sclerenchymatous ring. The air-cavities are large and uniform and are  separated by bands of parenchymatous cells. In each of these bands lies  a vascular bundle on the upper side near the periphery. Sometimes we  find, especially in young stages, diaphragms of stellulate cells  stretched across the air-cavities. Later as the stem matures these  disappear and the cavities become conspicuous. (See figs. 42 and 43.)    =Structure of the root.=--As already stated, the roots of grasses  conform to the monocotyledonous type, but the variations met with in  their structure are not so great as in the case of the stem. The  root-tips are protected by root-caps, and the actual tip of the root is  very distinct in the roots of all grasses and it can be seen very  clearly in a longitudinal section of the root. The actual tip of the  root is sharply distinct from the root-cap as there are two distinct  sets of cells, one giving rise to the root-tip and the other to the  root-cap.    The young root-tips are always free from root-hairs, and they are  confined to the portions behind the root-tips. The extent of the  root-hair region will vary according to the vigour and development of  the roots and the nature of the soil. The root-hairs are mere  protrusions of the cells of the outermost layer of the cortex of the  root and this layer is called the =piliferous layer=.    [Illustration: Fig. 44.--Transverse section of a part of the root of  Pennisetum cenchroides. x 100    1. Root-hair; 2. piliferous layer; 3. cortex; 4. endodermis; 5.  pericycle; 6. xylem; 7. phloem.]    To learn the structure of the roots of grasses we may select as types  the roots of _Pennisetum cenchroides_ and _Andropogon Sorghum_ and  consider their structural details. In the transverse sections of these  roots we find a fairly broad cortex consisting of thin-walled  parenchymatous cells more or less regularly arranged. (See figs. 44 and  45.) Just below the piliferous layer two or three layers of thick-walled  cells are seen. In the roots of _Andropogon Sorghum_ these thick-walled  cells are very conspicuous as they consist of several layers. These  layers of thick-walled cells constitute the =exodermis=. (See fig. 46.)  The innermost layer of cells of the cortex is called the =endodermis=  and it becomes conspicuous on account of the thickening in the lateral  and inner walls of the cells of this layer. (See figs. 44 and 47.)    [Illustration: Fig. 45.--Transverse section of the entire root of  Andropogon Sorghum. x 25]    [Illustration: Fig. 46.--Transverse section of the cortical portion of  the root of Andropogon Sorghum. x 150    r.h. Root-hair; p.l. piliferous layer; ex. exodermis; co. cortex.]    The rest of the root forming the central core is the stele and at its  periphery there is a single layer of cells called the =pericycle=. The  arrangement of the xylem and the phloem is different from that of the  stem. They lie side by side on different radii, and not one behind the  other on the same radius as in the stem. The number of xylem groups is  fairly large and the development of the xylem is from the pericycle  towards the centre of the stele. (See figs. 44 and 45.) The  parenchymatous cells in the centre of the stele become thick-walled in  older roots.    =Structure of the leaf.=--The structure of the leaf of grasses is quite  characteristic of the family. In every leaf a number of vascular  bundles, some small and others large, pass from the base to the apex.  Externally the leaf is covered on both"]]]
