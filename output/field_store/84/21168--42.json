Self-love is the medium through which the soldier ascends into glory.  When Napoleon earned immortal fame in Italy, he nourished and  dignified this passion by addressing his soldiers in language  breathing the lofty spirit of the heroic age, he rekindled the courage  of his army, and every man became a conqueror. But the royalist  officers sought to destroy all warlike sentiment by expressing their  contempt for our national victories, by displaying the puffed  insolence of birth and rank; and they lost the confidence and the  esteem of the army which they were appointed to command.    Widely different, indeed, was the example which was set by the most  exalted and most formidable of our enemies. It is needless to name  him. This sovereign never tried to undervalue our glory: he was only  happy when he could bear testimony again and again to the talents and  the courage of the French nation. When he received our officers he did  not treat them with that ill-concealed disdain, so often lavished on  the conquered, but with the honest esteem inspired by valour; and with  that delicacy, I would almost say respect, which is due to honourable  misfortune. The subject of his discourse sometimes compelled him to  allude to our reverses; but he never failed to allay the smart by  lavishing his praises on the efforts which we had made to deprive him  of victory. He seemed to be astonished that he had been able to  withstand us.    How deeply were our warriors affected when they contrasted his  chivalrous magnanimity with the endeavours of their royalist masters,  who tried incessantly to poison the fond recollection of their former  triumphs, and to deprive them of the only consolation which remained  to them in the hour of affliction.    Whatever discontent might prevail amongst the troops, yet the greater  part of the staff and regimental officers had transferred themselves  to the Bourbons with cordial sincerity. Perhaps a few, who were less  confident than the rest, still appeared distrustful and lukewarm; but  they might have been easily won over, either by those sugared and  alluring phrases which sound so sweetly when pronounced by royalty, or  even by merely leaving them quiet until their resentment could cool of  itself.    When Henry IV. recovered his throne, the bigoted partisans of the  league, whom he had pardoned, continued still to threaten and revile  him. It was suggested that he should punish them; but Henry said,  \"No,--we must wait, they are yet vexed.\" Those who were constantly  invoking the memory of good king Henry, never sought to imitate his  conduct. Instead of allowing time to our generals to get over their  vexation, they embittered their temper by daily insults. Our officers  were treated like ruffian bandits; they were branded as rebels, who  were too happy if they obtained a pardon. Praise and favour fell only  to the share of the army of Conde, the Vendeans, and the Chouans. The  triumphal arches destined to eternize the exploits of our armies were  menaced with sacrilegious ruin; and it was solemnly proposed to erect  a monument to the memory of the Vendeans and the emigrants who fell at  Quiberon.    Certainly our deluded brethren deserved to be regretted and mourned.  Yet they had turned their weapons against the sacred bosom of their  country. They were either the auxiliaries or the hirelings of our  implacable enemies the English, and if honours were paid to them as  illustrious victims, it was equivalent to a declaration that their  conquerors were their murderers.    Our warriors had been graced with titles of nobility, bought with the  blood which they had shed in the defence of the country. Their honours  were treated with insolent scorn, and the ghost of Georges Cadoudal, a  murderer in effect, and a traitor in intent, was ennobled by the  gracious patent which was bestowed upon his father.    Georges in attempting the life of Napoleon had committed an act  against all law, whether human or divine. If such a crime was decked  out as a virtue, if signal rewards were allotted to the memory of the  criminal, the government abetted assassination and regicide. The  safety of Louis XVIII. and of every other monarch was compromised, and  a sanction was given to the dangerous and antisocial doctrine which  teaches that any individual may sit in judgment on the legitimacy of  the title of the occupier of the throne, and then determine to murder  his sovereign if he doubts the validity of his rights.    Other affronts exactly of the same complexion were offered to France  and to the army. Titles, military commissions, and pensions, were  showered, in La Vendee, upon the heads of such of the Chouans as were  most celebrated for their cruelty[9], and these marks of favour were  distributed amongst them in the presence of the victims of their  rapine and ferocity.                       [Footnote 9: The Chouans never allowed the                     opportunity of committing murder to escape them.                     They carried their muskets as they walked by the                     side of the plough, and the furrows which they trod                     were frequently sprinkled with blood. The priests                     who had taken the oaths, and the purchasers of                     national domains, were particularly the objects of                     the refinements of their cruelty. They seldom                     entered a town without plundering the inhabitants,                     and without slaughtering those who had been pointed                     out to their vengeance.--_Lacretelle, Precis de la                     Revolution._]    The members of the ruling faction thought that they had not done  enough in endeavouring to honour the French enemies of France at the  expense of her defenders, and therefore they compassed the degradation  and destruction of the institutions which reminded the people of the  praises and the glory of our national armies.    In despite of the most solemn engagements the government robbed the  legion of honour of its prerogatives. Then the ministerial papers  hinted that henceforward the order of St. Louis was to be the only  military order; and that the legion of honour was to be the reward of  civil merit. The blow was aimed at the heart; the army shuddered, our  marshals burned with indignation. The government was compelled to  disclaim and abandon its intent.    Yet one sure method of debasing the legion of honour was completely in  the power of government; they could make it cheap, and to this plan  they resorted. Under Napoleon the Cross was never granted until it had  been long and truly deserved: now it became the prey of meanness. The  order was prostituted and cast to favourite underlings and intriguers,  to whom it was distributed by caprice or bribery.    Our soldiers, who had purchased this distinction with their  blood,--the magistrates, the functionaries, the learned, the  manufacturers, who had received it as the reward of the services which  they had rendered to the state, to the arts, to useful industry,--all  were filled with consternation when they found themselves elbowed by a  mean and worthless mob. Yielding to their honest pride, the greater  part of our old legionaries refused to wear the insignia, which,  instead of conferring distinction, could only confound them with men  whom public opinion had branded and proscribed.    Success encouraged the government, and they did not stop. Richly  endowed asylums for the daughters of the deceased members of the  legion had been founded by the Emperor. Under the pretext of economy,  of saving the annual sum of forty thousand francs, the ministers took  the King by surprise, and hurried the Sovereign into the signature of  an order for turning the orphans out of doors. Marshal Macdonald  declared in vain that the old leaders of the army would never abandon  the children of their companions, and that they were ready to defray  the expense which was falsely assigned as the motive of the expulsion  of the girls. Equally fruitless was the generosity of Madame Delchan,  the matron of the establishment of Paris, who offered to continue its  management without any assistance from the government, and to expend  her entire fortune in the support of her pupils. Nor did the ministers  pay the least attention to those who stated that the greater part of  the children had neither friends nor relations, and that if they were  thrown destitute upon the world, they would be inevitably consigned to  misery or vice. No consideration could move the pity of the ministry.    But at length the indignation of the public found a voice in the Lower  House, and the representatives of the people were about to remonstrate  with the Sovereign. Ministers were disconcerted and abashed, and they  abandoned their profligate enterprise.    This check, however, did not amend them. A few days afterwards they  dissolved the military academies of St. Cyr and St. Germain, alleging  that they were superfluous; and at the same moment the \"Ecole Royale  Militaire\" was re-established, \"in order that the nobility of the  kingdom might enjoy the advantages secured to them by the edict of  January 1757.\"    By this impudent violation of the principles of the charter our  representatives were again roused, and the ministers were again  obliged to recede.    Irritated by these defeats, they sought revenge and actuated by an  ill-judged hope of weakening the resisting obstacles, they dismissed a  countless multitude of military officers, who were turned out of the  army upon half pay, though their full pay had been formally  guarantied. It must be acknowledged that the number of the officers of  the imperial army was much greater than was required by the strength  of the royal army;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#6)"],[1," become a  law decided to pass it over the governor's head. When this attempt was  made, Theodore Roosevelt got up boldly and said he could not again vote  for the bill--that he was satisfied that Governor Cleveland's view of  the matter was correct.    \"These people would not have put their money in the elevated railroads  had they not been assured that the fare was to be ten cents,\" said he.  \"We are under obligation to them, and we must keep our promises.\" And so  the bill fell through. It was not in itself right that the fare should  be ten cents, and it has long since been reduced to five cents, but it  shows that Theodore Roosevelt was bound to do what was right and just,  according to the dictates of his own conscience, and this won for him  many friends, even among those who had opposed him politically.    In a work of this kind, intended mainly for the use of young people, it  is not necessary to do more than glance at the work which Theodore  Roosevelt accomplished while a member of the New York Assembly.    He made a close study of the various political offices of New York  County and discovered that many office-holders were drawing large sums  of money in the shape of fees for which they were doing hardly any work.  This he considered unfair, and by dint of hard labor helped to pass a  law placing such offices on the salary list, making a saving to the  county of probably half a million dollars a year.    One of the best things done by Theodore Roosevelt at that time was the  support given by him to a civil service law for the state. Up to that  time office-holding was largely in the hands of the party which happened  to be in power.    \"This is all wrong,\" said the young assemblyman. \"A clerk or anybody  else doing his duty faithfully should not be thrown out as soon as there  is a political change.\" The new law was passed, and this was the  beginning of what is commonly called the merit system, whereby a large  number of those who work for the state are judged solely by their  capabilities and not by their political beliefs. This system has since  been extended to other states and also to office-holding under the  national government.    Another important measure pushed through the Assembly by Theodore  Roosevelt was what was known as the Edson Charter for New York City,  giving to the mayor certain rights which in the past had rested in the  board of aldermen. This measure was defeated during Roosevelt's second  term of office, but in 1884 he pressed it with such force that it  overcame all opposition and became a law. Many have considered this  victory his very best work.    By those who knew him at this time he is described as having almost a  boyish figure, frank face, clear, penetrating eyes, and a smile of  good-natured friendship and dry humor. When he talked it was with an  earnestness that could not be mistaken. By those who were especially  bitter against him he was sometimes called a dude and a silk stocking,  but to these insinuations he paid no attention, and after the encounter  at the Delavan House his opponents were decidedly more careful as to how  they addressed him.    \"Take him all the way through he was generally even tempered,\" one has  said who met him at that time. \"But occasionally there was a flash from  his eye that made his opponent draw back in quick order. He would stand  a good deal, but there were some things he wouldn't take, and they knew  it. One thing is certain, after he was in the Assembly for a few months  everybody knew perfectly that to come to him with any bill that was the  least bit shady was a waste of time and effort. Roosevelt wouldn't stand  for it a minute.\"    In those days Theodore Roosevelt did not give up his habits of athletic  exercise, and nearly every day he could be seen taking long walks in the  country around Albany. In the meantime his \"Naval War of 1812\" was well  under way, but he could spare only a few hours occasionally to complete  his manuscript.    His married life had thus far been a happy one, and its joy was greatly  increased by the birth of his daughter Alice. As will be seen later, Mr.  Roosevelt is what is called a family man, and he took great comfort in  this new addition to his little household. But his happiness was  short-lived, for in 1884, when the daughter was but a baby, the beloved  wife died, and the little one had to be given over to the care of the  grandparents in Boston. Not many months later Mr. Roosevelt's mother  died also, heaping additional sorrow upon his head.    With the conclusion of his third term in the Assembly Theodore  Roosevelt's work as a member of that body came to an end. If he had made  some enemies, he had made more friends, and he was known as an ardent  supporter of reform in all branches of politics. In recognition of his  ability he was chosen as a delegate-at-large to the Republican  convention brought together to nominate a candidate to succeed  President Arthur.    At that time James G. Blaine from Maine had served many years in the  United States Senate, and it was thought that he would surely be both  nominated and elected. But many were opposed to Blaine, thinking he  would not support such reform measures as they wished to see advanced,  and among this number was Theodore Roosevelt.    \"We must nominate Mr. Edmunds,\" said the young delegate-at-large, and  did his best for the gentleman in question.    \"It cannot be done,\" said another delegate.    The convention met at Exposition Hall in Chicago, and Mr. Roosevelt was  placed on the Committee on Resolutions. It was a stormy convention, and  ballot after ballot had to be taken before a nomination could be  secured. Blaine led from the start, with Senator Edmunds a fairly close  second.    \"If Blaine is nominated, he will be defeated,\" said more than one.    At last came the deciding vote, and James G. Blaine was put up at the  head of the ticket, with John A. Logan for Vice-President.    At once Blaine clubs were organized all over the country, and the  Republican party did all in its power to elect its candidate. He was  called the Plumed Knight, and many political clubs wore plumes in his  honor when on parade. In the meantime the Democrats had nominated Grover  Cleveland.    The fight was exceedingly bitter up to the very evening of election day.  When the votes were counted, it was found that Blaine had been defeated  by a large majority, and that Grover Cleveland, Roosevelt's old friend,  had won the highest gift in the hands of the nation.    His work at the convention in Chicago was Theodore Roosevelt's first  entrance into national affairs, and his speeches on that occasion will  not be readily forgotten. It was here that he came into contact with  William McKinley, with whom, sixteen years later, he was to run on the  same ticket. The records of that convention show that on one occasion  McKinley spoke directly after Roosevelt. Thus were these two drawn  together at that early day without knowing or dreaming that one was to  succeed the other to the Presidency.    But though Theodore Roosevelt was disappointed over the nomination made  at Chicago, he did not desert his party. Instead he did all he could to  lead them to victory, until the death of his mother caused him to  withdraw temporarily from public affairs.    [Illustration: Signature: Alice Lee Roosevelt]          CHAPTER V    THEODORE ROOSEVELT AS A RANCHMAN AND HUNTER IN THE BAD LANDS--BRINGING  DOWN HIS FIRST BUFFALO--RATTLESNAKES, AND A WILD GOOSE      Theodore Roosevelt had now published his \"Naval History of the War of  1812,\" and it had created a decidedly favorable opinion among those  critics who were best able to judge of the production. It is an  authoritative work, and is to-day in the library of nearly every  American war-ship afloat, as well as in numerous government libraries in  this country, as at Washington, West Point, and Annapolis, and also in  leading libraries of England.    Being out of politics the young author thought of taking up his pen once  more. But he was restless by nature, and the loss of his wife and his  mother still weighed heavily upon him. So he took himself to the West,  to where the Little Missouri River flows in winding form through what  are called the Bad Lands of North Dakota.    Here, on the edge of the cattle country, Theodore Roosevelt had become  possessed of two ranches, one called the Elkhorn and the other Chimney  Butte. Both were located by the river, which during the dry season was  hardly of any depth at all, but which during the heavy rains, or during  the spring freshets, became a roaring torrent.    At one of these ranches Theodore Roosevelt settled down for the time  being, to rough it in hunting and raising cattle. When the weather would  not permit of his going abroad, or when the mood of the author seized  him, he wrote. As a result of these experiences he has given us a  delightful work called \"The Hunting Trips of a Ranchman,\" first  published in 1885, giving his adventures among the cattle and while on  the hunt, sometimes alone and sometimes in company with the rude but  honest cow punchers and plainsmen who surrounded him.    Mr. Roosevelt has described the ranch at which he lived for the greater  part of his time as a long, low, story-high house of hewn logs, clean  and neat, and with many rooms. It faced the river, and in front was a  long, low veranda, where one might idle on a clear, warm day to his  heart's content. Inside, the main room contained a shelf full of the  owner's favorite outdoor books and the walls half-a-dozen pet pictures.  Rifles and shot-guns stood handy in corners, and on pegs and deer horns  hung overcoats of wolf or coon skin and gloves of otter or beaver.    That Theodore Roosevelt was a close observer of all that occurred around  him is proved by his writings. With great minuteness he has described  his life at the ranch home and while in the saddle, both in winter"]]]
