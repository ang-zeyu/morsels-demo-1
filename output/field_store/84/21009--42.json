Will naught content you but that your  shadow must lie like a curse upon the land? And do you think in your  pride that France, this Job among the nations, will suffer it forever?\"    He paused as if for a reply. But none came. The Marquis considered him,  strangely silent, a half smile of disdain at the corners of his lips, an  ominous hardness in his eyes.    Again Andre-Louis tugged at his friend's sleeve.    \"Philippe.\"    Philippe shook him off, and plunged on, fanatically.    \"Do you see nothing of the gathering clouds that herald the coming of  the storm? You imagine, perhaps, that these States General summoned  by M. Necker, and promised for next year, are to do nothing but devise  fresh means of extortion to liquidate the bankruptcy of the State?  You delude yourselves, as you shall find. The Third Estate, which you  despise, will prove itself the preponderating force, and it will find  a way to make an end of this canker of privilege that is devouring the  vitals of this unfortunate country.\"    M. le Marquis shifted in his chair, and spoke at last.    \"You have, monsieur,\" said he, \"a very dangerous gift of eloquence. And  it is of yourself rather than of your subject. For after all, what  do you offer me? A rechauffe of the dishes served to out-at-elbow  enthusiasts in the provincial literary chambers, compounded of the  effusions of your Voltaires and Jean-Jacques and such dirty-fingered  scribblers. You have not among all your philosophers one with the wit to  understand that we are an order consecrated by antiquity, that for our  rights and privileges we have behind us the authority of centuries.\"    \"Humanity, monsieur,\" Philippe replied, \"is more ancient than nobility.  Human rights are contemporary with man.\"    The Marquis laughed and shrugged.    \"That is the answer I might have expected. It has the right note of cant  that distinguishes the philosophers.\"    And then M. de Chabrillane spoke.    \"You go a long way round,\" he criticized his cousin, on a note of  impatience.    \"But I am getting there,\" he was answered. \"I desired to make quite  certain first.\"    \"Faith, you should have no doubt by now.\"    \"I have none.\" The Marquis rose, and turned again to M. de Vilmorin, who  had understood nothing of that brief exchange. \"M. l'abbe,\" said he once  more, \"you have a very dangerous gift of eloquence. I can conceive of  men being swayed by it. Had you been born a gentleman, you would not so  easily have acquired these false views that you express.\"    M. de Vilmorin stared blankly, uncomprehending.    \"Had I been born a gentleman, do you say?\" quoth he, in a slow,  bewildered voice. \"But I was born a gentleman. My race is as old, my  blood as good as yours, monsieur.\"    From M. le Marquis there was a slight play of eyebrows, a vague,  indulgent smile. His dark, liquid eyes looked squarely into the face of  M. de Vilmorin.    \"You have been deceived in that, I fear.\"    \"Deceived?\"    \"Your sentiments betray the indiscretion of which madame your mother  must have been guilty.\"    The brutally affronting words were sped beyond recall, and the lips that  had uttered them, coldly, as if they had been the merest commonplace,  remained calm and faintly sneering.    A dead silence followed. Andre-Louis' wits were numbed. He stood aghast,  all thought suspended in him, what time M. de Vilmorin's eyes continued  fixed upon M. de La Tour d'Azyr's, as if searching there for a meaning  that eluded him. Quite suddenly he understood the vile affront. The  blood leapt to his face, fire blazed in his gentle eyes. A convulsive  quiver shook him. Then, with an inarticulate cry, he leaned forward, and  with his open hand struck M. le Marquis full and hard upon his sneering  face.    In a flash M. de Chabrillane was on his feet, between the two men.    Too late Andre-Louis had seen the trap. La Tour d'Azyr's words were but  as a move in a game of chess, calculated to exasperate his opponent into  some such counter-move as this--a counter-move that left him entirely at  the other's mercy.    M. le Marquis looked on, very white save where M. de Vilmorin's  finger-prints began slowly to colour his face; but he said nothing more.  Instead, it was M. de Chabrillane who now did the talking, taking up his  preconcerted part in this vile game.    \"You realize, monsieur, what you have done,\" said he, coldly, to  Philippe. \"And you realize, of course, what must inevitably follow.\"    M. de Vilmorin had realized nothing. The poor young man had acted upon  impulse, upon the instinct of decency and honour, never counting the  consequences. But he realized them now at the sinister invitation of M.  de Chabrillane, and if he desired to avoid these consequences, it was  out of respect for his priestly vocation, which strictly forbade such  adjustments of disputes as M. de Chabrillane was clearly thrusting upon  him.    He drew back. \"Let one affront wipe out the other,\" said he, in a dull  voice. \"The balance is still in M. le Marquis's favour. Let that content  him.\"    \"Impossible.\" The Chevalier's lips came together tightly. Thereafter he  was suavity itself, but very firm. \"A blow has been struck, monsieur. I  think I am correct in saying that such a thing has never happened before  to M. le Marquis in all his life. If you felt yourself affronted, you  had but to ask the satisfaction due from one gentleman to another. Your  action would seem to confirm the assumption that you found so  offensive. But it does not on that account render you immune from the  consequences.\"    It was, you see, M. de Chabrillane's part to heap coals upon this fire,  to make quite sure that their victim should not escape them.    \"I desire no immunity,\" flashed back the young seminarist, stung by  this fresh goad. After all, he was nobly born, and the traditions of his  class were strong upon him--stronger far than the seminarist schooling in  humility. He owed it to himself, to his honour, to be killed rather than  avoid the consequences of the thing he had done.    \"But he does not wear a sword, messieurs!\" cried Andre Louis, aghast.    \"That is easily amended. He may have the loan of mine.\"    \"I mean, messieurs,\" Andre-Louis insisted, between fear for his friend  and indignation, \"that it is not his habit to wear a sword, that he has  never worn one, that he is untutored in its uses. He is a seminarist--a  postulant for holy orders, already half a priest, and so forbidden from  such an engagement as you propose.\"    \"All that he should have remembered before he struck a blow,\" said M. de  Chabrillane, politely.    \"The blow was deliberately provoked,\" raged Andre-Louis. Then he  recovered himself, though the other's haughty stare had no part in  that recovery. \"O my God, I talk in vain! How is one to argue against a  purpose formed! Come away, Philippe. Don't you see the trap...\"    M. de Vilmorin cut him short, and flung him off. \"Be quiet, Andre. M. le  Marquis is entirely in the right.\"    \"M. le Marquis is in the right?\" Andre-Louis let his arms fall  helplessly. This man he loved above all other living men was caught in  the snare of the world's insanity. He was baring his breast to the knife  for the sake of a vague, distorted sense of the honour due to himself.  It was not that he did not see the trap. It was that his honour  compelled him to disdain consideration of it. To Andre-Louis in that  moment he seemed a singularly tragic figure. Noble, perhaps, but very  pitiful.            CHAPTER IV. THE HERITAGE    It was M. de Vilmorin's desire that the matter should be settled out  of hand. In this he was at once objective and subjective. A prey to  emotions sadly at conflict with his priestly vocation, he was above  all in haste to have done, so that he might resume a frame of mind more  proper to it. Also he feared himself a little; by which I mean that his  honour feared his nature. The circumstances of his education, and the  goal that for some years now he had kept in view, had robbed him of much  of that spirited brutality that is the birthright of the male. He had  grown timid and gentle as a woman. Aware of it, he feared that once the  heat of his passion was spent he might betray a dishonouring weakness,  in the ordeal.    M. le Marquis, on his side, was no less eager for an immediate  settlement; and since they had M. de Chabrillane to act for his cousin,  and Andre-Louis to serve as witness for M. de Vilmorin, there was  nothing to delay them.    And so, within a few minutes, all arrangements were concluded, and you  behold that sinisterly intentioned little group of four assembled in  the afternoon sunshine on the bowling-green behind the inn. They were  entirely private, screened more or less from the windows of the house by  a ramage of trees, which, if leafless now, was at least dense enough to  provide an effective lattice.    There were no formalities over measurements of blades or selection  of ground. M. le Marquis removed his sword-belt and scabbard, but  declined--not considering it worth while for the sake of so negligible an  opponent--to divest himself either of his shoes or his coat. Tall, lithe,  and athletic, he stood to face the no less tall, but very delicate and  frail, M. de Vilmorin. The latter also disdained to make any of the  usual preparations. Since he recognized that it could avail him nothing  to strip, he came on guard fully dressed, two hectic spots above the  cheek-bones burning on his otherwise grey face.    M. de Chabrillane, leaning upon a cane--for he had relinquished his sword  to M. de Vilmorin--looked on with quiet interest. Facing him on the  other side of the combatants stood Andre-Louis, the palest of the four,  staring from fevered eyes, twisting and untwisting clammy hands.    His every instinct was to fling himself between the antagonists, to  protest against and frustrate this meeting. That sane impulse was  curbed, however, by the consciousness "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#6)"],[1,"Choral.    On the east are the foundations of the castle, which was formerly one of  the strongest on the Welsh marches.    The cathedral is especially rich in architecture of the Norman, Early  English, and Early Decorated periods.    The work of the Norman builders, found chiefly in the interior, survives  in the exterior aspect rather in the \"sturdy\" quality remaining through  the subsequent building being imposed upon the old foundations. The side  apses of the original triple eastern termination were converted into the  present eastern transept; an operation, the result of which helps to  produce an intricate outline already irregular through the projections of  the porch of Bishop Booth.    The *Central Tower*, a splendid example of Decorated work, is of two  stages above the roofs, with buttresses at the angles. It is covered with  a profusion of ball-flower ornament, which, except in the south nave aisle  of Gloucester Cathedral, is nowhere else so freely used.             [Illustration: BISHOP BOOTH'S PORCH AND NORTH TRANSEPT.]                     BISHOP BOOTH'S PORCH AND NORTH TRANSEPT.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      Pershore Abbey is not far from Hereford, and from the disposition of the  upper windows of the central tower and the style and position of the  dividing pilasters and bands of ornament, it seems likely that the earlier  lantern of Pershore is partly responsible for its design.    In old prints of the cathedral the great central spire which formerly  existed is shown. It was a timber erection, covered with lead. When this  was taken down at the time of the great repairs and rebuilding of the west  end, a stunted, squat appearance was given to the building. In the year  1830 Canon Russell presented a sum of money to the Dean and Chapter to  build four appropriate pinnacles at the angles.    The tower which formerly stood at the west end was similar in design to  the central one, but rose only one stage above the leads of the nave. This  seems to have been used as a belfry; whereas the central tower was a  lantern.    The large projecting *North Porch*, completed in 1530 by Bishop Booth, is  Perpendicular, and somewhat resembles, though it is later in date, the  porch in the centre of the west front at Peterborough. The front entrance  archway has highly enriched spandrels and two lateral octagonal staircase  buttress turrets at the angles. These have glazed windows in the upper  portions, forming a picturesque lantern to each. This outer porch consists  of two stories, the lower of which is formed by three wide, open arches,  springing from four piers at the extreme angles, two of which are united  with the staircase turrets, the others with the ends of the old porch. The  upper story, containing an apartment, is sustained on a vaulted and  groined roof, and has three large windows, with elaborate tracery.    In the north transept the massive buttresses with bevelled angles, of  which those at the angles are turreted, with spiral cappings, the  remarkable windows, tall without transoms, and rising nearly the whole  height of the building, show to great advantage. The clerestory windows,  like those in the outer wall of the triforium in the nave of Westminster,  are triangular on the exterior.    On the eastern side of this transept, which has an aisle, is an unusual  architectural feature. The windows of the triforium have semi-circular  arched mouldings, enclosing a window of three lights of lancet-shaped  arches. Beneath the aisle window is a pointed arched doorway, which was  probably an original approach to the shrine of Cantilupe.    In the angle is a staircase turret, which is circular at the bottom and  polygonal above; and this probably was an access to a private apartment  for a monk over the aisle of the transept containing the sacred shrine.    Continuing an examination of the north side of the cathedral one notices  the buttresses of the north-east transept, the Stanbury Chapel, the  windows, parapet, and roof of the aisle, the clerestory windows with  arcade dressings to the walls, and the modern parapet above the whole.                   [Illustration: GENERAL VIEW, FROM THE WEST.]                           GENERAL VIEW, FROM THE WEST.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      The style of the arcade and window, and also the blank window or double  arch, with two smaller arches within the clerestory wall, claims especial  attention, as well as the ribbed roof rising above the Norman triforium.    We now come to the Early English work of the *Lady Chapel*, the east end  of which is especially noticeable, with its bold angular buttresses rising  from immense bases. The numerous and large base mouldings running round  the wall of this building, its tall lancet-shaped windows, arcades, and  ovolar and lozenge-shaped panels, are so many interesting peculiarities of  design.    The Audley Chapel projects on the south side. The angular, embattled  parapet at the end is a modern addition.    The south side of the cathedral is not easily examined by the public,  being shut within the walls of a garden between the Bishop's and the  Vicars' Cloisters.    The *Bishop's Cloisters* consist of two walks only, or covered corridors,  though that on the west, which was pulled down in the reign of Edward VI.  to make room for a pile of brick building appropriated to the Grammar  School, and in its turn demolished in 1836, is now in course of  restoration.    It does not appear that the cloisters ever had a walk on the north side  against the cathedral.    These cloisters are of Perpendicular date, and between a continued series  of buttresses are windows of large dimensions, with mullions and tracery.    The vaulting of the roof is adorned with numerous ribbed mouldings, at the  intersections of which are shields charged with sculptured figures,  foliage, arms, etc. These ribs spring from slender pillars between the  windows and corbels heads on the other side: over the exterior of the  windows are carved grotesque heads, of which we give some illustrations.  The south walk of the cloisters is the more richly groined. At the  south-east corner is a square turreted tower containing a small chamber,  which has been carefully and completely restored. It has always been  called the \"Ladye Arbour,\" although no one has been able to discover the  origin of this name or the use to which the chamber was put; many  antiquarians suggest a possible reference to the Virgin.      [Illustration: EXTERIOR OF THE LADY CHAPEL. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.]              EXTERIOR OF THE LADY CHAPEL. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.      The entrance doorway to the *Chapter-house* from the east walk still  remains, but is walled up. It consists of a pointed arch under a lofty,  richly ornamented pedimental moulding, having clustered shafts on the  sides, with foliated capitals. The archway is divided by a slender pillar  into two smaller openings. The once elegant chapter-room to which this  doorway communicated, whether or not they fell, as Britton asserts,  \"beneath the fanatic frenzy of the Cromwellian soldiers,\" was certainly  neglected; and then, as long as any material could be got from it, treated  as a stone quarry by Bishop Bisse and his successors. This chapter-house  appears to have been a beautiful piece of design of the rich Decorated  period. It was decagonal in plan, with a projecting buttress at each  angle. Each side, except the one occupied by the entrance, was sub-divided  into five panels or seats. Remains of three sides only are left, and these  only as far as the window-sills.    Against the south wall of the cloisters, towards its east end, are some  remains of two Norman chapels, one above the other. The lower was  dedicated to St. Katherine and the upper to St. Mary Magdalene.    \"The form, excepting a portico and choir (_i.e._ chancel) was an exact  square; four pillars in the middle, with arches every way, supported the  roof; the portico was composed of a succession of arches retiring inwards,  and had a grandeur in imitation of Roman works; two pillars on each side  consisted of single stones. There was a descent of a few steps to the  lower chapel, which had several pillars against the walls made of single  stones, and an octagonal cupola on the four middle pillars. The walls were  much painted, and the arched roof was turned with great skill, and  resembled the architecture which prevailed during the declension of the  Roman Empire (see Stukeley, Havergal, etc.).    Mentioning the existence of the doorway and two small windows in the  remaining north wall, the author of _The Picturesque Antiquities of  Hereford_ proceeds to say: \"These are extremely interesting, as they  pertained to an edifice which once stood on the south side of this wall,  and is believed to have been the original church of St. Mary, the patron  saint of the cathedral before the translation of the body of St.  Ethelbert. It was the parish church of St. Mary, to which the residences  in the cathedral close belonged. Transcripts of registers of marriages  there solemnised so late as the year 1730 are existent in the Dean's  archives.\"    A second cloister, known as the *Vicars' Cloister*, connects the Vicars'  College with the south-east transept. The arrangement here may be compared  with that of Chichester, as showing the most probable plan of the latter  before the destruction of the south walk and its connection with the  cloister of the Vicars Choral.    In the area of the Bishop's Cloister was formerly a preaching cross, which  fell into a decayed state during the latter part of the last century.  Beneath it was a dome of masonry which closed the aperture to a well of  considerable depth, which had been formed with great exactness. This well  still exists beneath a plain square stone. Another well was (according to  Stukeley) situated between the College and the Castle Green, with a  handsome stone arch over it. "]]]
