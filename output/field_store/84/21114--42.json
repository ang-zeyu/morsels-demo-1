It would never do to spoil an effect which had been achieved  with so much trouble; so the unselfish creature gulped down her tears,  and tried to talk cheerfully on impersonal topics, keeping her eyes  fixed on the landscape the while, lest the sight of her child might  prove too much for her resolution.    Rhoda was immaculate in blue serge coat and skirt, and sailor hat with a  band of school colours.  Nothing could have been simpler; but there are  ranks in even the simplest garments, and she was agreeably conscious  that her coat was not as other coats, neither was her skirt as other  skirts.  The hand of the Regent Street tailor was seen in both, and  there was a new arrangement of pleats at the back which ought in itself  to secure the admiration of the school!  She was all complacency until  Euston was reached, when the first glimpse at a group of \"Hurst\" girls  smote her to earth.  She had sewn the band on her hat upside down,  putting the wide stripe next the brim, which should by rights have been  the place of the narrow!  To the cold, adult mind such a discovery might  seem of trifling importance, but to the embryo school-girl it was  fraught with agonising humiliation.  It looked so ignorant, so stupid;  it marked one so hopelessly as a recruit; Rhoda's cheeks burned crimson;  she looked searchingly round to see if by chance any other strangeling  had fallen into the same error, but, so far as bands were concerned, she  was solitary among the throng.    A governess, seeing the two figures standing apart from the rest, came  forward and welcomed Rhoda with a few kindly words, but she was too busy  to spare time for more than a greeting.  Fresh girls kept arriving with  every moment--a crowd of brisk, alert, bustling young creatures,  skurrying along bags in hand, and bright eyes glancing to right and  left.  At every step forward there would come a fresh recognition, a nod  of the head, a wave of the hand, a quick \"Halloa!\" more eloquent than  elegant.  Rhoda felt a spasm of loneliness at the realisation that no  greeting waited for herself, and at the strangeness of the many faces.  She looked critically around and came to the most unfavourable  conclusions.    \"I don't like that one--she's a fright!  I hate that one--she's so  affected.  Those two look common; I won't have anything to do with  _them_.  The big one with spectacles looks horribly learned.  The one  with the violin has a most unmusical face.  _She_ looks fit for  stratagems if you like!  The little one in brown is a cunning fox, I can  see it in her eyes.  Of all the plain, uninteresting, stodgy set of  girls--\"    There was a movement inside the saloon carriage opposite, and a large  mamma clad in black, with a profusion of bugles, stepped on to the  platform and marched stolidly away.  She steered a course clear of the  crowd of girls, the ends of her mantle floating behind her, like a brig  in full sail before the breeze, while her poor little daughter hung out  of the doorway gazing after her, sobbing bitterly, and mouthing in  pathetic, helpless misery.    Mrs Chester began to cry at once in sympathy, and even Rhoda felt a  smarting of the eyes.  It was coming!  The crucial moment was at hand;  the bell was ringing, the girls were crowding into the carriages, the  governess stepped forward and spoke a warning word.    \"You had better come now, dear!  Please take your seat.\"    Rhoda turned and bent her tall young head to her little mother, but  neither spoke--the tension was too great.  Mrs Chester's face was  tremulous with agitation, the girl's white and defiant.  Then she  stepped into the carriage and seated herself among the crowd of  strangers.  The girls were all silent now, pale of face and red of eye,  a few crying openly, the majority fighting against emotion.  The mothers  came to the edge of the platform, and stared in through the windows.    \"It is like looking at animals in a cage,\" said Rhoda to herself, and  then the wheels began to move, she saw her mother's quivering face--saw  it from a distance--saw it no more--and realised for the first time,  with a great, bitter pang of anguish, the meaning of farewell!    She had not intended to cry, she had never believed it possible that she  _would_ cry, but it was hard work to resist it during the next half-  hour, when every second bore her further from home, and the strangeness  of her surroundings pressed more heavily upon her.  Other girls were  beginning to cheer up and exchange confidences with their companions,  but she had no one with whom to talk.  Two girls opposite--the foxey one  and the affected one--were chatting quite merrily together.  The  affected one, whose name appeared to be Hilda, had spent part of her  holiday at Boulogne, and was discoursing on the delights of Continental  bathing, while Foxey, not to be outdone, would have her know that  Scarborough kept pace with all the Continental methods.    Another girl made the harrowing discovery that she had left her  spectacles at home, and announced the same to a chum, who remarked that  it was \"a ripping joke!\"  The violin girl had had a bicycling accident,  and exhibited her scars with pride.  The shock of parting over, they all  seemed very happy together, very friendly, very absorbed; far too much  absorbed to notice a new-comer, or trouble themselves on her behalf.  The governess stood by Rhoda's side for a few minutes and made remarks  in an aggressively cheerful manner, but her reception was not  encouraging, and presently she went away, and did not return.    Rhoda looked at the pictures in her magazines, or pretended to look, for  her brain was so much occupied with other matters that she could not  grasp their meaning, and after five minutes' inspection would hardly  have been able to say whether she had been studying the features of a  country landscape or those of a society beauty.  Then she turned and  cautiously examined her neighbours.  The girl to the right was a square,  stolid-looking creature, square-faced, square-shouldered, with square  toes to her boots, and elbows thrust out on each side in square,  aggressive fashion.  Her eyes were small and light, and her nose a  defiance of classic traditions; the corners of her mouth turned down,  and she had at once the solemnest and the most mischievous expression it  is possible to imagine.  After a critical survey of her charms, Rhoda  felt that she was not the person with whom to force a conversation, and  turned her attention to the neighbour on her left.    A recruit, surely; for, though her hat-band was in order, there was in  her mien an absence of that brisk, independent air which seemed to  characterise the old Hurst girl.  A pretty damsel, too, with curling  hair and soft dark eyes, which at the present moment were bent in  elaborate scrutiny on the paper before her.  Rhoda noticed that it was  the advertisement page at which she was looking, and suspected a pre-  occupation kindred to her own.  She coughed slightly and ventured a  gentle question--    \"Is this your first term at school?\"    The dark-eyed girl turned a fleeting glance upon her, so fleeting that  it seemed as if she had never altered her position, and replied  monosyllabically:    \"Yes.\"    \"You are going up, like me, for the first time?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you have never been to school before?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I mean a boarding school.  A big school like this, on all the new  lines?\"    \"Yes.\"    This was disconcerting!  What _did_ she mean?  It was her first term,  she was a new girl, and yet she had been up before!  What was the girl  thinking about!  She might really trouble herself to say more than one  single word.    \"But you said--I understood you to say--\"    Brown Eyes turned fiercely upon her, and fairly snapped in indignation.    \"I don't care what I said, or what you understood.  Can't you _see_ I  want to be quiet?  Can't you leave me alone?  If I am a new girl, I  don't want to howl before all the others, do I!  Very well, then! don't  make me talk!  Read your book, and let me read mine.\"    \"I _beg_ your pardon!\" said Rhoda, in her most stately manner.  She took  up her magazine obediently, but now it was more impossible than ever to  read it, for she was tingling with mortification.  Such a snub from a  stranger, and when she was trying to be friendly too!  It would be a  long time before she troubled Brown Eyes again.  Her thoughts went back  regretfully to Ella, the loyal, the sympathetic, the faithfully  admiring.  If Ella were only here now, how different it would be!  Why  had she not thought of it before, and asked her parents to pay Ella's  fees, so that she might have the solace of her presence?  They would  have done it gladly, but, alas!  Ella could not have been spared from  home.  She had to help her mother; to be governess as well as pupil,  teaching the younger children for part of every day.  No!  Ella was  impossible; but the craving for companionship grew so intense that it  even conquered the dread inspired by her other companion, and  strengthened her to make yet another effort.    The train had just left a station whose name was familiar in her ears,  and she realised that they had crossed the boundary between two  counties, and were now in Blankshire, in which Hurst Manor itself was  situated.  To remark on this fact seemed an innocent and natural manner  of opening a conversation, so she turned towards Square Face, and said  brightly, \"Now we are in Blankshire, I see!  I have never been here  before.  The country looks very pretty and undulating.\"    The girl turned and stared at her with a wooden stolidity of feature.  Seen at close quarters she appeared to Rhoda as at once the most  extraordinarily ugly and comical-looking creature she had ever beheld.  Her little eyes blinked, and the thin lips flapped up and down in an  uncanny fashion that refused to be likened to any ordinary thing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#6)"],[1,"fashion to be fed. I  believe it is very rarely the case that wild ducks, however they may  appear domesticated, will remain all the year through with those who  have reared them, and really take their place in the poultry-yard with  the other inmates. Still it has been known, and I will subjoin an  account given me by a friend, which goes to prove that such a state of  things is possible. My friend gave me in substance the following account  of her wild ducks:--    \"There are different kinds of wild ducks; these are mallards. The first  we had were hatched by hens. They feed with the other ducks, but show a  decided preference for Indian corn. They are very troublesome about  laying, often leaving their eggs exposed, where the crows find them and  carry them off. We gather most of them we find, to take care of them  (though the ducks lay in different places each time their nest is  robbed) until there are preparations for sitting, when, if we have been  fortunate enough to discover the fact, we add a number of the previously  gathered eggs.    \"The sitting duck comes for food every two or three days, and that is  all we see of her for some time, until at length she may be seen coming  through the meadow, the half-grown mowing grass behind her trembling and  waving in an unusual manner: by-and-by, the road or shorter grass is  reached, when it is found the proud mother is bringing home her little  fluffy family of perhaps eight to eleven darkie ducklings--quick,  active, tiny things that refuse at first all friendly advances, but  becoming accustomed to their surroundings soon behave much in the manner  of their elders. There are dreadful fights on the pond when two or more  little families arrive about the same time, the mother of one flock  tyrannizing over the members of another, and thus causing many deaths.  They often fly away, but they always come back again. All through the  winter they go under cover with the other ducks, but when spring comes  they are not to be found at night; nevertheless they are sure to be  ready for breakfast next morning.\"    I confess I always had a faint hope that my ducks might stay with me, or  at any rate return from time to time, but their wild nature prevailed,  and they finally left; only Luther reappeared alone one day and took his  last \"diet\" from my hand; but there was a look in his pretty blue eye  which said plainly, \"You will never see me again,\" and he had his final  caress and departed \"to fresh woods and pastures new.\"    [Illustration: _TINY, SIR FRANCIS DRAKE AND LUTHER_]          [Illustration]    THE JAY.      My Jay was taken from the parent nest, built on the stem of an  ivy-covered tree which had been blown down in the winter. A young jay is  a curious-looking creature: the exquisite blue wing feathers begin to  show before the others are more than quills; the eyes are large and  bright blue, and when the great beak opens it shows a large throat of  deepest carmine, so that it possesses the beauty of colour from its  earliest days, and when full grown and in fine plumage it is one of the  handsomest of our birds. In its babyhood my jay was much like other  young things of his kind, always clamouring for food, and seeming to  care for little else, but as he grew up he attached himself to me with a  wonderful strength of affection which entirely reversed this order of  things, for whenever I came into the room he was restless and unhappy  until I came near enough for him to feed me, he would look carefully  into his food-trough, and at last select what he thought the most  tempting morsel, and then put it through the bars of his cage into my  mouth. He would sometimes feed other people, but as a rule he disliked  strangers, and I have known him even take water in his beak and squirt  it at those who displeased him. On the whole, a jay is not a very  desirable pet; he is restless in a cage, and too large to be quite  convenient when loose in a room; again, his great timidity is a  drawback--the least noise, the sight of a cat or dog, puts him in a  nervous fright, and he flutters about with anxious notes of alarm. He  is seen to best advantage hopping about on a lawn, where he may be  attracted by acorns being strewn in winter and spring. It is a pity that  his marauding habits in game preserves lead to his being so ruthlessly  shot by gamekeepers till it is almost a rare sight to see the handsome  bird and hear his note of alarm in the woods. One morning I saw a jay on  the lawn near the house, and rather wondering as to what he was seeking,  in a minute or two I saw him pounce upon a young half-fledged bird and  carry it off in his beak, a helpless little baby wing fluttering in the  air as he flew away. Their sight is wonderfully keen, and their cunning  is amusing to watch as they steal by careful steps nearer and nearer to  their prey, and at last by a sudden dart secure it and make off in rapid  flight.    [Illustration: THE JAY.]    After a year or two my poor jay met with a very sad fate. A garden-party  was to take place, and knowing the jay's terror of any unusual noise or  upstir, I carried his cage to a quiet room where I hoped he would be  quite happy and hear nothing.    I, however, did not happen to notice that, later on, the band had  established their quarters near this room, and I suppose the unwonted  sounds drove the poor bird into a wild state of terror, and that in his  flutterings he had caught his leg in the bars of the cage; anyway, I  went up about the middle of the party to see how my pet was faring, when  I found him in utter misery clinging to the bars, his thigh dislocated  and his leg hopelessly broken. It was a mournful duty to carry him away  to merciful hands that would end his torture by an instant death. For  many a day I missed that bright, handsome birdie who had always a  welcome for me and the offer of such hospitality as his cage afforded.    [Illustration]          [Illustration: A YOUNG CUCKOO.]          [Illustration]    A YOUNG CUCKOO.      Looking out of my window before six o'clock one bright morning in early  summer, I chanced to see a large bird sitting quietly on the gravel  walk. Its feathers were ruffled as if it felt cold and miserable, and  its drooping head told a tale of unhappiness from some cause or other.  Whilst I was watching it, a little bird darted with all its force  against the larger one, and made it roll over on the path; it slowly  rose up again, but in another minute a bird from the other side flew  against it and again rolled it over. Such conduct could not be  tolerated, so, dressing quickly, I went out, and picking up the strange  bird I found it was a young cuckoo nearly starved to death, having, as I  supposed, lost its foster-parents. The bird was in beautiful plumage,  except down the front of its throat, where the repeated attacks of the  small birds in showing their usual enmity towards the cuckoo, had  stripped off the feathers. The poor bird was only skin and bone, nearly  dying from lack of food and persecution, and made no resistance when I  brought him in to see if I could act the part of foster-mother.  Finely-mixed raw meat and brown bread seemed to me the best substitute  for his insect diet--but he _was_ an awkward baby to feed--though  sinking for want of nourishment he would not open his great beak, and  every half-hour he had to be fed sorely against his will with many  flapping of his wings and other protests of his bird nature. He would  not stay quiet in any sort of cage, but when allowed to perch on the rim  of a large basket quite free, he remained happily enough by the hour  together. After a few days he grew into a vigorous, active bird, flying  round the room, and too wild to be retained with safety He was  therefore let loose, and soon flew quite out of sight. I should hope he  was quite able to support himself by his own exertions. I must say he  showed no gratitude for my benevolent succour in his time of need.    [Illustration: YOUNG CUCKOO ATTACKED BY BIRDS]          [Illustration]    THE TAMING OF OUR PETS.      Since the love of animal and bird pets seems so universal, both amongst  rich and poor, it is well that the desire to keep creatures in captivity  should be wisely directed, and that young people especially should be  led to think of the things that are requisite to make their pets live  and prosper in some degree of happiness.    I have often been consulted by some sweet, impulsive child about its  \"pet robin\" or \"dear little swallow,\" as to why it did not seem to eat  or feel happy? and have found the poor victims quietly starving to  death on a diet of oats, canary seed, or even green leaves, the infant  mind not feeling quite sure what the \"pretty birdies\" lived upon.    It is needless to say we might as well try to keep a bird on pebbles as  give hard grain to a soft-billed insect-eating bird; but this kind of  cruelty is constantly practised simply from ignorance. I would therefore  endeavour to give a few general rules for the guidance of those who have  a new pet of some kind, which they wish to domesticate and tame.    To begin with animals; suitable food, a comfortable home, means of  cleanliness, and exercise are essential to their health and comfort.  These four requisites are seldom fully attended to. Often a large dog is  kept in a back yard in London chained up week after week--kept alive, it  is true, by food and water, but without exercise, and with no means of  ridding himself of dirt and insects by a plunge now and then into a pond  or river. No wonder his piteous howls disturb the neighbours, and he is  spoken of as \"that horrid dog!\" as if it was his fault poor fellow! that  he feels miserable and uses his only language of complaint.    One would suggest, it is better not to keep such a dog in a confined  space in town, but if he is to be retained he should have one or two  daily scampers for exercise, the"]]]
