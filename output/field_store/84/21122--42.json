That's  the person that interrupted me. And I'd like to have him put out of the  party too, along with this queer old chap who insulted me a moment ago.\"    Chirpy Cricket looked around, until his eye rested on Buster Bumblebee,  who had just arrived and who was at that moment talking with Betsy  Butterfly.    \"There's the young man you hear!\" Chirpy told Joseph Bumble. \"Don't you  know him?\"    \"No!\" replied Joseph, as his eyes followed Chirpy Cricket's. \"And I  don't want to know him, either. He looks to me to be a very ordinary  person. And anybody can see that he's annoying Betsy Butterfly. I tell  you, I want him chased away from here at once. For I'm of royal blood;  and I'm not accustomed to go to parties with ragtags and bobtails. I'm a  cousin of Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's son.\"    Well, Chirpy Cricket tried hard not to laugh right in Joseph Bumble's  face.    \"I'll see what I can do,\" Chirpy promised him. \"And I will admit that  _somebody_ ought to be barred out of this party.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Joseph Bumble. \"I'm glad to know that you're so  sensible.\"    Perhaps he would have spoken in a different fashion had he known exactly  what Chirpy Cricket had in mind. But now he said nothing more, though he  continued to stare angrily at Buster Bumblebee, who was glad to see  Betsy Butterfly, and was telling her as much, too.          XVI    NOTHING BUT A FRAUD      AT last Joseph Bumble's displeasure passed all control. He began to buzz  as loud as he could, hoping to drown Buster Bumblebee's buzzing, so that  Buster could no longer talk to Betsy Butterfly.    Naturally, Buster soon had to raise his own voice, in order to make  himself heard. And soon the two made such a roar that everybody else had  to stop up his ears.    Noticing a look of distress on Betsy Butterfly's face, Buster asked her  what the trouble was.    \"You and your cousin Joseph are making a terrible racket,\" she told him.    \"My cousin Joseph!\" cried Buster Bumblebee. \"And who is he, I should  like to know? Point him out to me, please! For I didn't know I had a  cousin at this party.\"    \"There he is!\" said Betsy Butterfly, nodding her head towards the  glowering Joseph.    \"What! That unshaven stranger in the yellowish-brown suit?\" cried Buster  Bumblebee. \"I assure you he's no relation of mine.\"    \"You must be mistaken,\" Betsy persisted. \"He says he's your cousin, and  of royal blood himself.\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried Buster Bumblebee. \"Just let me talk to him a moment,  and I'll soon prove that your friend is nothing but a fraud.\"    Accordingly Buster left her, and straightway perched himself upon a  daisy directly in front of Joseph Bumble.    \"How-dy do!\" said Buster. \"I hear you've been talking about me.\"    Now, Joseph Bumble's only thought was that the noisy chap in the yellow  and black velvet must have overheard what he had said to Chirpy Cricket  about throwing him out of the party.    \"I don't care to talk with you,\" Joseph announced in his grandest  manner. \"I'm from such a fine family that I have to be very particular  about whom I'm seen with.\"    \"Is that so?\" said Buster. \"I suppose if Buster Bumblebee were at this  party you'd be glad to talk with him?\"    \"I should say I would!\" was the other's answer. \"He's my cousin.\"    \"What's your name, anyhow?\" Buster Inquired.    \"Joseph Bumble!\"    \"What's the rest of it?\" Buster Bumblebee demanded, while the whole  company surged around him, so that they might hear.    \"I refuse to answer!\" said Joseph Bumble. And afterward Daddy Longlegs  declared that at that moment he saw the fellow's knees trembling.    \"Come!\" said Joseph Bumble, turning suddenly to Betsy Butterfly. \"I see  that we've accidentally fallen in with some rough people; and we'd  better be moving on.\"    But Betsy Butterfly didn't even look at Joseph.    \"What _is_ his full name?\" she asked Buster.    \"He's a Bumble Flower-Beetle,\" Buster said. \"And as for his being  related to me, that's all humbug. This stranger is no kin either to the  Bumblebee or any other Bee family. But his voice is so much like ours  that he's taken part of our name, though our family has always claimed  that he has no right to it.\"    \"Who are you?\" Joseph Bumble demanded of Buster quite fiercely. He was  determined to put his enemy to rout if he could.    \"I'm Buster Bumblebee!\" was the reply. \"Don't you know your cousin?\"    When he heard that, Joseph Bumble knew at once that the game was up. His  trickery was discovered beyond a doubt. So with one last lingering look  at the beautiful Betsy he took to his wings. And no one ever saw him in  those parts again.    As for Betsy Butterfly, she never could bear, after that, to hear the  name of Joseph Bumble so much as mentioned.          XVII    DUSTY'S DIFFICULTY      IT was to be expected that as time went on, Betsy Butterfly's fame would  spread far and wide. And long before the summer was over, half the  creatures that lived in Pleasant Valley knew her. They were the ones  that went about by daylight and rested at night.    As for the other half--the night-prowlers--many of them had heard about  the beautiful Betsy, though of course they had never seen her. That is,  none of them had set eyes on her except Freddie Firefly, who had flashed  his light upon Betsy all one night, because Mrs. Ladybug had a strange  notion that she was stealing butter from the farmhouse.    In fact, after that happened, Freddie Firefly had gone about telling all  his friends how beautiful Betsy Butterfly was, and saying what a pity it  was that she didn't like moonlight as well as sunshine.    He talked so much about her that at last a good many of the  night-prowling people said that they wished they might see Betsy  Butterfly just once, for they could scarcely believe that anybody  could be as dainty and bewitching as Freddie Firefly would have  them believe her.    And there was one dashing young chap of the Moth family who became  especially eager to make Betsy's acquaintance. Indeed, he began to  complain that he was losing his appetite, through thinking about Betsy  Butterfly. So he besought Freddie Firefly to help him out of his  difficulty.    Now, while he was talking with Freddie Firefly, this young Moth, who was  known as Dusty, never once stopped eating. Freddie Firefly noticed how  his fat sides stuck out.    And he wondered what the fellow's appetite could have been like before  he lost some of it.    \"You don't act like one in delicate health,\" Freddie Firefly observed,  as he watched the greedy Dusty consume more food.    \"Oh, but I am!\" Dusty Moth protested feebly. \"I'm so weak now that I can  hardly raise myself with my wings.\"    Freddie was sure that Dusty's trouble was merely due to his being too  fat. But he saw no reason for quarreling with him.    \"Can't you think of some plan by which I could meet Betsy Butterfly?\"  Dusty Moth persisted. \"Perhaps if I could see her just once I'd be able  to get my mind _off_ her--and _on_ my meals again.\"    \"I don't know how I can help you,\" Freddie Firefly confessed. \"You see,  Betsy goes home exactly at sunset. And at present she never seems to  make her home in the same place for even two nights. So one can never be  sure where she will be.    \"Of course, when the sun is shining you can always find her among the  flowers. But that won't help you any, because you're such a sleepy-head  in the daytime that you couldn't see anything even if it was stuck right  into your eyes.\"    \"Can't you explain my sad case to Betsy Butterfly?\" Dusty Moth asked  hopefully. \"I've heard that she's very kind-hearted. And if she knew how  I'm suffering on her account I'm sure she'd be glad to meet me some  pleasant, dark night.\"    He begged so piteously that in the end Freddie Firefly agreed to do what  he could.    \"But I warn you--\" he said--\"I warn you that I can't give you much  hope.\"          XVIII    SOLOMON OWL'S IDEA      FREDDIE FIREFLY actually did send a message to Betsy Butterfly, telling  her that Dusty Moth wanted to see her, and saying that unless she would  agree to meet him in the meadow some night soon, Dusty was afraid he  would lose his appetite entirely.    But Betsy thought the whole affair was only a joke. So she merely  laughed--and sent Freddie no answer at all; for she hardly believed  that she needed to explain to him that nothing could induce her to  stir out after sunset.    Freddie Firefly was much upset because he received no answer to his  message. Perhaps he would not have cared so much had Dusty Moth not made  his life miserable each night from dusk to dawn. But that persistent  fellow kept asking Freddie every few minutes if he had \"heard from her\"  yet. And naturally anyone would grow tired if he had to keep saying \"No!  no! no!\" all night long.    At the same time Dusty Moth kept insisting in a most annoying way that  if he lost much more of his appetite he would be ill, and it would be  Freddie Firefly's fault.    So Freddie Firefly began to worry. He came finally to detest Dusty Moth.  And Freddie's family noticed that he was growing quite thin, because  Dusty Moth left him little time--between questions--in which to eat his  meals comfortably.    \"I declare, I wish Betsy Butterfly would move away from Pleasant  Valley!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed at last, quite out of patience with  everybody and everything. \"I'm in a pretty fix, I am! And since I don't  know how to get rid of this annoying Dusty Moth, I'm going to ask  Solomon Owl what I'd better do.\" That, at least, was a comforting  thought.    So the following morning, just before dawn, he made what might be termed  a flying call on Solomon Owl who lived in the hemlock woods beyond the  swamp.    And luckily wise old Solomon thought of a good plan at once. As soon as  he had heard Freddie Firefly's story he said to him:    \"If Betsy Butterfly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#6)"],[1,"had no friends to  co-operate with them outside, and no plan of action which was possibly or  likely to be carried out successfully.  The lot of these, however, was  not shared by all, for Durand, as will be seen by his recital, had not  done amiss, thanks to his wit, ingenuity, and cleverness.    The following is Durand's narrative:--    \"As you know, Monsieur Le Capitaine (he always called my father so), I am  a Frenchman, fond of liberty and change, and this detestable prison  became so very irksome to me, with its scanty food and straw beds on the  floor, that I had for some time determined to make my escape and go to  Ireland, where I believe sympathies are strong towards the French nation.  I am, as you know, acquainted with Monsieur P---, who resides in  Dale-street; I have done some work for him.  He has a niece who is _toute  a faite charmante_.  She has been a constant ambassador between us, and  has brought me work frequently, and taken charge of my money when I have  received any, to deposit with her uncle on my account.  I hold that young  lady in the highest consideration.  This place is bad for anyone to have  property in, although we are in misery alike.  Some of us do not know the  difference between my own and thy own.  We have strange communist ideas  in this building.  Now \"Monsieur Le Capitaine\" you want to know how I got  away, where I went, and how I came back.  I will tell you.  I could not  help it.  I have had a pleasing three months' holiday, and must be  content to wait for peace or death, to release me from this _sacre_  place.  The niece of Monsieur P--- is very engaging, and when I have had  conversation with her in the hall where we are permitted to see our  friends, I obtained from her the information that on the east side of our  prison there were two houses which opened into a short narrow street.  One of these houses had been lately only partly tenanted, while the lower  portion of it had been under repair.  Mademoiselle is very complacent and  kind.  She took the trouble to go for me to the house and examine it, and  reported that there was an open yard under the eastern prison-wall, and  if anybody could get through that wall he might easily continue his route  through the house and into the street.  My mind was soon made up.  I  imparted my intention to my companions.  There were fifteen of us,  altogether, penned up at night in a vile cell or vault, and, of course,  the intended escape could not be kept a secret; what was known by one,  must be known by all.  We all resolved to escape.  Our cell was dirty and  miserable.  We obtained light and air from the street as well as from a  grating over the door.  Choosing a somewhat stormy night, we commenced by  loosening the stonework in the east wall.  Now we knew that after we were  locked up for the night we should not be disturbed, and if we could not  effect the removal of the stones in one night, there would be no fear of  discovery during the next day, as we were seldom molested by any of the  gaolers.  We could walk about the prison just as we liked and mix with  the other prisoners, whether felons or debtors.  In fact your Liverpool  Tower contains a large family party.  We worked all night at the wall,  and just before daybreak contrived to remove a large stone and soon  succeeded in displacing another, but light having at length broken, we  gathered up all the mortar and rubbish we had made, stuffing some of it  into our beds, and covering the rest with them in the best way we could.  To aid us in preventing the gaoler discovering what we had been about,  one of our party remained in bed when the doors were unlocked, and we  curtained the window grating with a blanket, stating that our  _compatriote_ was very ill and that he could not bear the light.  We had  no dread of a doctor coming to visit him, for unless special application  was made for medical attendance on the sick nobody seemed to care whether  we lived or died.  The day passed over without any suspicions arising  from our preparations.  The afternoon set in stormy, as the preceding  evening had done, and in the course of the night of our escape we had a  complete hurricane of rain and wind, which eventually greatly favoured us  by clearing the streets of any stragglers who might be prowling about.  No sooner were we locked in at night than we recommenced our work at the  wall, and were not long in making a hole sufficient to allow a man to  creep through, which one of us did.  He reported himself to be in an open  yard, that it was raining very heavily, and that the night was  _affreuse_; we all then crept through.  We found ourselves in a dark  yard, with a house before us.  We obtained a light in a shed on one side  of the yard, and then looked about.  We found a sort of cellar door by  the side of a window.  We tried to open it: to our surprise it yielded.  Screening our light we proceeded into a passage, taking off our shoes and  stockings first (some of us had none to take off, poor fellows!) so that  we should make no noise.  The house was quite still; we scarcely dared to  breathe.  We went forward and entered a kitchen in which were the remains  of a supper.  We took possession of all that was eatable on the table.  It was wonderful that nobody heard us, for one of us let fall a knife  after cutting up a piece of beef into pieces, so that each man might have  a share.  Although there were people in the house no one heard us; truly  you Englishmen sleep well!  Before us was a door--we opened it.  It was  only a closet.  We next thought of the window, for we dared not climb up  stairs to the principal entrance.  We tried the shutters which we easily  took down and, fortunately without noise, opened the window, through  which one of us crept to reconnoitre.  He was only absent about a minute  or two, returning to tell us that not a soul was to be seen anywhere;  that the wind was rushing up the main street from the sea, and that the  rain was coming down in absolute torrents.  Just as the neighbouring  church clock struck two we were assembled under an archway together.  We  determined to disperse, and let every man take care of himself.  Bidding  my friends good bye I struck out into the street.  At first I thought of  going to the river, but suddenly decided to go inland.  I therefore went  straight on, passed the Exchange, and down a narrow street facing it  (Dale-street) in which I knew mademoiselle dwelt.  I thought of her, but  had no hope of seeing her as I did not know the house wherein she  resided.  I pushed on, therefore, until I came to the foot of a hill; I  thought I would turn to the left, but shutting my eyes with superstitious  feelings I left myself to fate, and determined to go forward with my eyes  closed until I had by chance selected one of the four cross roads [Old  Haymarket, Townsend-lane (now Byrom-street), Dale-street, and  Shaw's-brow] which presented themselves for my choice.    \"I soon found I was ascending a hill, and on opening my eyes I discovered  that I was pursuing my route in an easterly direction.  I passed up a  narrow street with low dirty-looking houses on each side, and from the  broken mugs and earthenware my feet encountered in the darkness, I felt  sure I was passing through the outskirts of Liverpool--famous for its  earthenware manufactures.  During all this time I had not seen a living  thing; in fact it was scarcely possible for anything to withstand the  storm that raged so vehemently.  In this, however, rested my safety.  I  sped on, and soon mounting the hill paused by the side of a large  windmill (Townsend mill) which stood at the top of London-road.  Having  gained breath, I pushed forward, taking the road to the right hand which  ran before me (then called the road to Prescot).  I began now to breathe  freely and feel some hope in my endeavour to escape.  My limbs, which,  from long confinement in prison, were stiff at first, now felt elastic  and nimble and I pushed on at a quick pace, the wind blowing at my back  the whole time; still onward I went until I got into a country lane and  had another steep hill to mount.  The roads were very heavy.  The  sidewalk was badly kept, and the rain made it ankle-deep with mud.  On  surmounting the hill, which I afterwards learned was called Edge-hill, I  still kept on to the right hand road, which was lined on both sides with  high trees.  I at length arrived at a little village (Wavertree) as a  clock was striking three; still not a soul was visible.  I might have  been passing through a world of the dead.  After traversing this village  I saw, on my left hand, a large pond, at which I drew some water in my  cap.  I was completely parched with my unusual exertions.  Resting under  a large tree which proved some shelter, I ate up the bread and meat I had  procured from the kitchen of the house through which we had escaped.  Having rested about half-an-hour I again started forward.  I now began to  turn over in my mind what I should do.  I felt that if I could get to  Ireland I could find friends who would assist me.  I knew a French priest  in Dublin on whom I could rely for some aid.  I at length hit upon a  course of action which I determined to pursue.  Through narrow lanes I  went, still keeping to the right, and after walking for more than an hour  I found myself in a quaint little village (Hale) in which there was a  church then building.  The houses were constructed principally of timber,  lath, and plaster and were apparently of great antiquity.  Onward still I  went, the rain beating down heavily and the wind blowing.  In about a  quarter of an hour I gained a sight of the river or the sea, I know not  which, but I still continued my road until I came up to a little cottage,  the door of which opened just as I was passing it.  An old woman came out  and began to take down the shutters.  Now, as I came along the road I had  made up my mind"]]]
