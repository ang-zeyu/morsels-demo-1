[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#6)"],[1," schoolhouse had been built and furnished with some care in 1652,  as this entry in the town records shows:         \"The feoffes agreed with Daniel Welde that he provide convenient       benches with forms, with tables for the scholars, and a conveniente       seate for the scholmaster, a Deske to put the Dictionary on and       shelves to lay up bookes.\"    The schoolmaster \"promised and engaged to use his best endeavour both  by precept and example to instruct in all Scholasticall morall and  Theologicall discipline the children so far as they be capable, all  A. B. C. Darians excepted.\" He was paid in corn, barley or peas, the  value of L25 per annum, and each child, through his parents or  guardians, supplied half a cord of wood for the schoolhouse fire. If  this load of wood were not promptly furnished the child suffered, for  the master did not allow him the benefit of the fire; that is, to go  near enough the fireplace to feel the warmth.    The children of wise parents like Cotton Mather, were also taught  \"opificial and beneficial sciences,\" such as the mystery of medicine--a  mystery indeed in colonial times.    Puritan schoolmasters believed, as did Puritan parents, that sparing the  rod spoiled the child, and great latitude was given in punishment; the  rod and ferule were fiercely and frequently plied \"with lamming and with  whipping, and such benefits of nature\" as in English schools of the same  date. When young men were publicly whipped in colleges, children were  sure to be well trained in smaller schools. Every gradation of  chastisement was known and every instrument from        \"A beesome of byrche for babes verye fit       To a long lastinge lybbet for lubbers as meete,\"    from the \"thimell-pie\" of the dame's school--a smart tapping on the head  with a heavy thimble--to belaboring with a heavy walnut stick or oaken  ruler. Master Lovell, that tigerish Boston teacher, whipped the culprit  with birch rods and forced another scholar to hold the sufferer on his  back. Other schoolmasters whipped on the soles of the feet, and one  teacher roared out, \"Oh the Caitiffs! it is good for them.\" Not only  were children whipped, but many ingenious instruments of torture were  invented. One instructor made his scholars sit on a \"bark seat turned  upside down with his thumb on the knot of a floor.\" Another master of  the inquisition invented a unipod--a stool with one leg--sometimes  placed in the middle of the seat, sometimes on the edge, on which the  unfortunate scholar tiresomely balanced. Others sent out the suffering  pupil to cut a branch of a tree, and, making a split in the large end of  the branch, sprung it on the culprit's nose, and he stood painfully  pinched, an object of ridicule with his spreading branch of leaves. One  cruel master invented an instrument of torture which he called a  flapper. It was a heavy piece of leather six inches in diameter with a  hole in the middle, and was fastened at the edge to a pliable handle.  The blistering pain inflicted by this brutal instrument can well be  imagined. At another school, whipping of unlucky wights was done \"upon a  peaked block with a tattling stick;\" and this expression of colonial  severity seems to take on additional force and cruelty in our minds that  we do not at all know what a tattling stick was, nor understand what was  meant by a peaked block.    I often fancy I should have enjoyed living in the good old times, but I  am glad I never was a child in colonial New England--to have been  baptized in ice water, fed on brown bread and warm beer, to have had to  learn the Assembly's Catechism and \"explain all the Quaestions with  conferring Texts,\" to have been constantly threatened with fear of death  and terror of God, to have been forced to commit Wigglesworth's \"Day of  Doom\" to memory, and, after all, to have been whipped with a tattling  stick.          II    COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE CUSTOMS      In the early days of the New England colonies no more embarrassing or  hampering condition, no greater temporal ill could befall any adult  Puritan than to be unmarried. What could he do, how could he live in  that new land without a wife? There were no housekeepers--and he would  scarcely have been allowed to have one if there were. What could a woman  do in that new settlement among unbroken forests, uncultivated lands,  without a husband? The colonists married early, and they married often.  Widowers and widows hastened to join their fortunes and sorrows. The  father and mother of Governor Winslow had been widow and widower seven  and twelve weeks, respectively, when they joined their families and  themselves in mutual benefit, if not in mutual love. At a later day the  impatient Governor of New Hampshire married a lady but ten days widowed.  Bachelors were rare indeed, and were regarded askance and with intense  disfavor by the entire community, were almost in the position of  suspected criminals. They were seldom permitted to live alone, or even  to choose their residence, but had to find a domicile wherever and with  whomsoever the Court assigned. In Hartford lone-men, as Shakespeare  called them, had to pay twenty shillings a week to the town for the  selfish luxury of solitary living. No colonial law seems to me more  arbitrary or more comic than this order issued in the town of Eastham,  Mass., in 1695, namely:         \"Every unmarried man in the township shall kill six blackbirds or       three crows while he remains single; as a penalty for not doing it,       shall not be married until he obey this order.\"    Bachelors were under the special spying and tattling supervision of the  constable, the watchman, and the tithingman, who, like Pliable in  Pilgrim's Progress, sat sneaking among his neighbors and reported their  \"scirscumstances and conuersation.\" In those days a man gained instead  of losing his freedom by marrying. \"Incurridgement\" to wedlock was given  bachelors in many towns by the assignment to them upon marriage of  home-lots to build upon. In Medfield there was a so-called Bachelor's  Row, which had been thus assigned. In the early days of Salem \"maid  lotts\" were also granted; but Endicott wrote in the town records that it  was best to abandon the custom and thus \"avoid all presedents & evil  events of granting lotts vnto single maidens not disposed of.\" This line  he crossed out and wrote instead, \"for avoiding of absurdities.\" He  kindly, but rather disappointingly, gave one maid a bushel of corn when  she came to ask for a house and lot, and told her it would be a \"bad  president\" for her to keep house alone. A maid had, indeed, a hard time  to live in colonial days, did she persevere in her singular choice of  remaining single. Perhaps the colonists \"proverb'd with the grandsire  phrase,\" that women dying maids lead apes in hell. Maidens \"withering on  the virgin thorn,\" in single blessedness, were hard to find. One  Mistress Poole lived unmarried to great old age, and helped to found the  town of Taunton under most discouraging rebuffs; and in the Plymouth  church record of March 19, 1667, is a record of a death which reads  thus:--         \"Mary Carpenter sister of Mrs. Alice Bradford wife of Governor       Bradford being newly entered into the 91st year of her age. She was       a godly old maid never married.\"    The state of old maidism was reached at a very early age in those early  days; Higginson wrote of an \"antient maid\" of twenty-five years. John  Dunton in his \"Life and Errors\" wrote eulogistically of one such ideal  \"Virgin\" who attracted his special attention.         \"It is true an _old_ (or superanuated) Maid in Boston is thought       such a curse, as nothing can exceed it (and looked on as a _dismal_       spectacle) yet she by her good nature, gravity, and strict virtue       convinces all (so much as the fleering Beaus) that it is not her       necessity but her choice that keeps her a Virgin. She is now about       thirty years (the age which they call a _Thornback_) yet she never       disguises herself, and talks as little as she thinks, of Love. She       never reads any Plays or Romances, goes to no Balls or       Dancing-match (as they do who go to such Fairs) to meet with       Chapmen. Her looks, her speech, her whole behavior are so very       chaste, that but once (at Govenor's Island, where we went to be       merry at roasting a hog) going to kiss her, I thought she would       have blushed to death.         \"Our _Damsel_ knowing this, her conversation is generally amongst       the women (as there is least danger from that sex) so that I found       it no easy matter to enjoy her company, for most of her time (save       what was taken up in needle work and learning French &c.) was spent       in Religious Worship. She knew time was a dressing-room for       Eternity, and therefore reserves most of her hours for better uses       than those of the Comb, the Toilet and the Glass.         \"And as I am sure this is most agreeable to the Virgin modesty,       which should make Marriage an act rather of their obedience than       their choice. And they that think their Friends too slowpaced in       the matter give certain proof that lust is their sole motive. But       as the Damsel I have been describing would neither anticipate nor       contradict the will of her Parents, so do I assure you she is       against Forcing her own, by marrying where she cannot love; and       that is the reason she is still a Virgin.\"    Hence it may be seen that though there was not in Boston the \"glorious  phalanx of old maids\" of Theodore Parker's description, yet the Boston  old maid was lovely even in colonial days, though she did bear the  odious name of thornback.    An English traveller, Josselyn, gives a glimpse of Boston love-making in  the year 1663.         \"On the South there is a small but pleasant Common, where the       Gallants, a little before sunset, walk with their Marmalet-Ma"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24186"],[0,"Zionism and Anti-Semitism (#6)"],[1,"the alleged power of the Jews are ridiculous exaggerations,  trumped up to scare the imagination of the thoughtless, as has been  proved over and over again. But even reduced to their true measure,  they prove, not the possession of magic, but of soundness of mind, of  unimpaired energy, and of all the other needful conditions for  success, which the Jews have kept intact despite all the attempts made  to crush the unbelievers into the dust. The outcry against them is  their vindication; people do not fear weaklings, do not raise alarms  against perils which can be pushed aside by an effort of the will. The  few must own inherent sources of strength if the many resort to the  coward's weapon of lies and slander. And in this instance the  admission of the truth is an implied homage to the religion which the  victors in the unequal struggle profess and defend. For it is  indisputable that this is the source to which the formation of the  Jewish mind and heart must be attributed. Let me cite, for one proof,  the admission of the most persistent and most powerful oppressor of  the Jews, the procurator of the Russian synod. Half the number of all  Hebrews are subjects of Russia. They came under her dominion when she  conquered and incorporated the Polish provinces; they are kept there  under the most stringent laws, and life is made to them as burdensome  as possible. \"The Pale\" is a gigantic ghetto where the oldest form of  rabbinism prevails to this day. Yet the same fear of the superiority  of the Jewish mind haunts the government; it is the alleged reason for  practically closing up all the avenues of the higher education for  them. Only _three per cent_ of the total number of students are  admitted to the universities and to the technical schools. But more  than a hundred thousand common soldiers are drafted from the Jews  into the armies and sent to all parts of the gigantic empire, kept  there during the best part of their lives, without any prospect of  promotion, and often going only to die in the defense of territories  which, if they were civilians, they would not be permitted to enter.  The Russian Torquemada, not long ago, openly declared that not a  single Jew should be permitted to settle amongst the peasantry, even  within the Pale, because he would be the only sober man amongst a  population that cannot resist the temptations of strong drink. Strange  spectacle indeed! Men banished from places where they wish to live  because they are too good for their surroundings! forced to remain  where they can hardly eke out a miserable living. The question,  surely, is justified. How did that poverty-stricken mass of oppressed  people succeed in preserving its freedom from a national vice in a  country where its ancestors have dwelt for long generations? Can a  great virtue be maintained by sorcery? The common experience is that  of the poet--        \"Misery doth bravest mind abate.\"    What but their religion made them proof against the arrows of a fate  which, for duration and cruelty, is without a parallel in history!  This conclusion is further corroborated by the fact that the same  virtue of sobriety characterizes them everywhere, and makes them an  object of envy to their non-Jewish neighbors,--nay, forces the honest  temperance advocate to hold them up before his Christian audiences as  examples to shame them into going and doing likewise; rather, let me  say, into staying at home and doing likewise. For one of the  witchcraft mysteries of Judaism is that its home is not in the church,  but that the church is in the home. The Jew's salvation is in nowise  dependent upon rabbi and synagogue, but upon wife and children. They  are his congregation to whom he ministers as priest in fulfilment of  the great charter word of dedication, \"Ye shall be unto me a kingdom  of priests and a holy nation.\" The deepest roots of the Jewish faith  rest and are nourished in the domestic soil. The synagogue has nothing  to offer to the faithful which he cannot find in his own tent. Ten men  gathered together with a Sepher Tora (scroll of the Mosaic law) in  their midst, form a Kahal Hakodesh (sacred body). No man becomes a  drunkard with wife and children and aged parents near him for guardian  angels. The greatest difficulty the Jewish reformation has to face is  what to substitute for the old ceremonials where they have become  impracticable, and thus to preserve the essentially domestic character  of the ancient faith. Is it thinkable that the Jew would be less  objectionable to his surroundings were he to lose his sturdy horror of  intemperance, and thus \"assimilate\" more freely with his neighbors of  different faiths? It is not thinkable when we consider the great  efforts made by Christians everywhere to redeem their people from  their bondage to strong drink and the misery resulting from it. The  Jew is the _natural ally of the temperance advocates_; and if he is  not found in their ranks, it is simply because he never knew from  experience the need of that reformation.    And never will he know, as long as his passionate fondness for home  and his longing for family love abide within him. At present, this,  generally speaking, is still the case; the poorest and least  cultivated classes are not excepted; nay, just in that class it is one  of the most noteworthy features. If the uncouth immigrant from Eastern  Europe stoops to the lowest kinds of peddling, or, for a mere  pittance, wastes his life in the stifling sweatshop; if he is not very  scrupulous in his dealings with his transient patrons, and does not  hold city ordinances as inviolable as those of the \"Shulchan Aruch\"  (code of ceremonials), the central motive is his ever present thought  of his family; even when he has not yet scraped together enough  pennies to pay for their fare to the new home, they are constantly  with him in his mind. This is not offered as a defense for  over-reaching and cannot be allowed by a magistrate as a plea for  law-breaking; but it is offered to the unprejudiced reader in  compliance with Spinoza's golden rule: Human errors must not be  ridiculed and condemned, but _understood_. _Si duo faciunt idem, non  est idem._ This wise caution is the more to be heeded in the present  instance, as, from the same source, devotion to home life, springs  another fine feature of Jewry; go down in the scale as deep as you  may, they are an industrious, toilsome class of people, often turning  their narrow homes into workshops where old and young ply a handicraft  from early morn to the late evening hours. Hundreds of men and women,  arriving in this country after they have passed the middle life, learn  trades and work at them till their trembling hands can hold the tools  no longer or the light fades from their overstrained eyes. Among them  there are not a few that have seen better days at their native places,  or are deeply learned in the Law. They are quick in seizing the  secret of a successful trade of paying manufacture, and not rarely  better the instruction; a skill for which they are hated and despised  by their own aristocracy in the markets, and branded as spoilers of  every good thing as soon as it appears. If this aptitude and eagerness  for trade be a fault, the Christians have themselves to blame for it.  Even a superficial glance at the history of Israel proves that as long  as the people lived on their native soil, and could live out their own  lives, they showed neither skill nor desire for mercantile pursuits;  that their legislation, their religion, their poetry and prophesying,  and their ethical ideas presuppose a nation of shepherds and tillers  of the soil. For the great change in the ruling disposition of the  Jews, since their dispersion, those alone are responsible who now  reproach them for it. The first Christians were Jewish ploughmen and  herdsmen; the Apostles mostly Judaean peasants and fishermen. The  finest parables and similes in the speeches of Jesus are taken from  the peasants' occupation and experience. And even to this day  thousands of the scattered race are ready to seize again the plough  and the spade, if they are given a chance, and not a few have done so  even under the most disheartening conditions. The fact is, the pagan  Mercury proved a more merciful god to the Jews than the Christian  Jesus, as he was taught and practised by the mediaeval Church. He  gloated over the sufferings of those who were of his own flesh and  blood. No wonder they sought refuge under the wings of the heathen  deity and became adepts in the art which he symbolized.    But suppose it were true that all the Jews dote on traffic as their  dearest occupation,--what of it? The British have the nickname of \"a  nation of shopkeepers\" fastened on them; yet they were and are the  greatest benefactors of the human race, carrying the blessings of  civilization to half the peoples of the globe. Commerce has done more  for the peace of the world than all the preaching, praying, and  prophesying taken together. A great railroad, a steamship line, a  cable or a telephone wire, a commercial treaty, a tariff  convention,--these are the modern bonds that hold the remotest parts  of the earth together, and make them equally abhor war and its  ravages. A falling off in the exports, a shrinking of the value of  investments, an unforeseen competitor in the markets of the world,  cause the rulers of the most civilized nations more anxiety than any  adverse political combination. For the former threaten the peace and  welfare of the home life of the people, on whose contentment they rely  for the defense of their claims in all their political intricacies. A  class of people credited with the mastery of the art of buying and  selling should, therefore, be welcome to every country and given the  amplest freedom and encouragement to ply their skill, provided, of  course, they do not carry their hoarded profits out of the country and "]]]
