If menstruation does not establish itself in a healthy or  normal manner at the proper time, consult a physician in order to  remove this abnormal condition. Any disturbance of the delicate  menstrual functions during the period, by constrained positions,  muscular effort, brain work and mental or physical excitement, is apt  to have serious consequences.                     CONTINENCE AND THE YOUNG ADOLESCENT GIRL    Continence is, as a rule more easily observed by the adolescent girl  than by the adolescent youth. Ordinarily the normal young girl has no  _undue_ sexual propensities, amorous thoughts or feelings. Though she  is exposed to the danger of meeting other girls who may be lewd in  thought and speech, in the houses of friends or at school, she is not  apt to be carried away by their example. Yet even a good, pure-minded  young girl may be debauched. Especially during adolescence, the easy  observance of natural continence depends greatly on the proper  functioning of the feminine genital organs. These may be easily  disturbed. The syringe used for injections, for so-called purposes of  cleanliness, is in reality a danger. The inner organs are  self-cleansing. Water or other fluids cast into them disorder the  mucous follicles, and dry up their secretions, preventing the flowing  out of some of Nature's necessities. A daily washing of the inner  organs for a long period with water also produces chronic leucorrhea.                               WHY YOUNG GIRLS FALL    Lack of proper early training, abnormal sex instincts, weak good  nature, poverty, all may be responsible for a young girl's moral  downfall. As a general thing, right home training and home  environment, and sane sex education will prevent the normally good  girl from going wrong. It should be remembered, though, that a  naturally more gentle and yielding disposition may easily lead her  into temptation. Girls who are sentimentally inclined should beware of  giving way to advances on the part of young men which have only one  object in view: the gratification of their animal passion.    The holding of hands and similar innocent beginnings often pave the  way for more familiar caresses. Passionate kisses--the promiscuous  kiss, by the way, may be the carrier of that dread infection,  syphilis--violently awaken a young girl's sex instincts. The fact is  that many innocent girls idealize their seducers. They believe their  lying promises, actually come to love them, and think that in  gratifying their inflamed desires, they are giving a proof of the  depth and purity of their own affection.    Here, as in the case of the young man, self-control should be the  first thing cultivated. And self-control should be made doubly sure by  never permitting one of the opposite sex to show undue familiarity.  Many a seemingly innocent flirtation, begun with a kiss, has ended in  shame and disgrace, in loss of social standing and position, venereal  disease, or even death. The pure-minded and innocent girl often  becomes a victim of her ignorance of the consequences entailed by  giving in to the desires of some male companion. _The girl who has a  knowledge of sex facts is less apt to be taken advantage of in this  manner._                   MODERN CONDITIONS WHICH ENCOURAGE IMMORALITY    _Excessive Freedom._--The excessive freedom granted the young girl,  especially since the World War, must be held responsible for a great  increase in familiarity between the adolescent youth of both sexes.  Many young girls of the \"flapper\" type, in particular, are victims of  these conditions of unrestrained sex association. Sex precocity is  furthered in coeducational colleges, in the high school and the home.  Adolescents of both sexes too often are practically unhampered in  their comings and goings, their words and actions. The surreptitious  pocket flask, filled with \"hooch,\" is often a feature of social  parties, dances and affairs frequented by young people. Girls and boys  drink together, and as alcohol weakens moral resistance in the one  case, and stimulates desire in the other, deplorable consequences  naturally result. In the United States the number of girls \"sent home\"  from colleges, and of high-school girls being privately treated by  physicians to save them from disgrace, is incredibly large.    Parents who do not control the social activities of their daughters,  who permit them to spend their evenings away from home with only a  general idea of what they are doing or whom they are meeting, need not  be surprised if their morals are undermined.    _The Auto._--The advent of the automobile is responsible for an easy  and convenient manner of satisfying precociously aroused sex instincts  in young girls and boys. Often, unconscientious pleasure-seekers roam  the roads in their auto. They accost girls who are walking and offer  them a \"lift.\" When the latter refuse to gratify their desires they  are often beaten and flung from the car. The daily press has given  such publicity to this civilized form of \"head hunting,\" that it is  difficult to sympathize with girls who are thus treated. They cannot  help but know that in nine cases out of ten, a stranger who invites  them to a ride, who \"picks\" them up, does so with the definite purpose  already mentioned in view.    _Poverty._--Poverty, too, plays a large part in driving young girls  into a life of vice. In all our large cities there are hundreds of  young women who earn hardly enough to buy food and fuel and pay for  the rent of a room in a cheap lodging house. Feminine youth longs for  dress, for company, for entertainment. It is easy enough to find a  \"gentleman friend\" who will provide all three, in exchange for  \"companionship.\" So the bargain is struck. These conditions exist in a  hundred and one occupations. A young woman may go to a large city as  pure as snow, but finding no lucrative employment, lonely and  despondent, she is led to take her first step on the downward path.  Soon daily contact with vice removes abhorrence to it. Familiarity  makes it habitual, and another life is ruined. The heartless moral  code of the cynical young pleasure-seeking male is summed up in the  cant phrase anent women: \"Find, ... and forget!\" It is these girls,  who are victimized by their lack of self-restraint or moral principle,  their ignorance or weakness, who make possible the application of such  a maxim.                                     VIRGINITY    Both mental and physical purity are rightfully required of the young  girl about to marry. How shall she acquire and maintain this desirable  state of purity? The process is a simple one. _She must let a  knowledge of the true hygienic and moral laws of her sex guide her in  her relations with men._ She must cultivate clean thought on a basis  of physical cleanliness. She need not be ignorant to be pure. Men she  should study carefully. She should not allow them to sit with their  arm about her waist, to hold her hand, to kiss her. No approach nor  touch beyond what the best social observance sanctions should be  permitted. Even the tendernesses and familiarities of courtship should  be restrained. An engagement does not necessarily culminate in a  marriage, and once the foot has slipped on virtue's path the error  cannot be recalled. These considerations, together with those adduced  in the preceding section, \"Why Young Girls Fall,\" are well worth  taking to heart by every young woman who wishes to approach matrimony  in the right and proper way.                                        CHAPTER VII                         SEX IN THE MARRIAGE RELATION                                  THE HUSBAND      Marriage is the process by which a man and woman enter into a complete  physical, legal and moral union. The natural object of marriage is the  complete community of life for the establishment of a family.                        THE MARRIAGEABLE AGE AND ADAPTATION    At twenty-four the male body attains its complete development; and  twenty-five is a proper age for the young man to marry. Romantic love,  personal affection on a basis of congeniality, mutual adaptation, a  similar social sphere of life, should determine his choice. Nature and  custom indicate that the husband should be somewhat older than the  wife.                             MEN WHO SHOULD NOT MARRY    Men suffering with diseases which may be communicated by contagion or  heredity should not marry. These diseases include: tuberculosis,  syphilis, cancer, leprosy, epilepsy and some nervous disorders, some  skin diseases and insanity. A worn-out rake has no business to marry,  since marriage is not a hospital for the treatment of disease, or a  reformatory institution for moral lepers. Those having a marked  tendency to disease must not marry those of similar tendency. The  marriage of cousins is not to be advocated. The blood relation tends  to bring together persons with similar morbid tendencies. Where both  are healthy, however, there seems to be no special liability to mental  incompetency, though such marriages are accused of producing defective  or idiot children. Men suffering from congenital defects should not  marry. Natural blindness, deafness, muteness, and congenital  deformities of limb are more or less likely to be passed on to their  children. There are cases of natural blindness, though, to which this  rule does not apply. Criminals, alcoholics, and persons  disproportionate in size should not marry. In the last-mentioned, lack  of mutual physical adaptability may produce much unhappiness,  especially on the part of the wife. Serious local disease, sterility,  and great risk in childbirth may result. Disparity of years, disparity  of race, a poverty which will not permit the proper raising of  children, undesirable moral character are all good reasons for not  marrying.

The entrances to the cavate dwellings opposite Squaw mountain are  visible from the road for quite a distance, appearing as rows of holes  in the steep walls of the cliff on the opposite or left bank of the  Rio Verde. Owing to their proximity to the river, from which the  precipice in which they are situated rises almost vertically, we were  unable to camp under them, but remained on the right bank of the  river, where a level plain extends for some distance, bordering the  river and stretching back to the distant cliffs. We pitched our camp  on a bluff, about 30 feet above the river, in full sight of the cave  entrances, near a small stone inclosure which bears quite a close  resemblance to a Tusayan shrine.    Aboriginal people had evidently cultivated the plain where we camped,  for there are many evidences of irrigating ditches and even walls of  former houses. At present, however, this once highly cultivated field  lies unused, and is destitute of any valuable plants save the scanty  grass which served to eke out the fodder of our horses.    At the time of my visit the water of Rio Verde at this point was  confined to a very narrow channel under the bluff near its right bank,  but the appearance of its bed showed that in heavy freshets during the  rainy season the water filled the interval between the base of the  cliffs in which the cavate dwellings are situated and the bluffs which  form the right bank.    In visits to the caves it was necessary, on account of the site of the  camp, to ford the stream each time and to climb to their level over  fallen stones, a task of no slight difficulty. The water in places was  shallow and the current only moderately rapid. Considering the fact  that it furnished potable liquid for ourselves and horses, and that  the line of trees which skirted the bluff was available for firewood,  our camp compared well with many which we subsequently made in our  summer's explorations.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCI^_b_    CAVATE DWELLINGS--OAK CREEK]    The section of the cliff which was examined embraced the northern  series of these caves, extending from a promontory forming one side of  a blind or box canyon to nearly opposite our camp. Adjacent to this  series of rooms, but farther down the river, on the same side, there  are two narrow side canyons, in both of which are also numerous caves,  in all respects similar to the series we chose for examination. At  several points on the summit of the cliffs, above the caves, large  rectangular ruins, with fallen walls, were discovered; these ruins  are, however, in no respect peculiar, but closely resemble those  ordinarily found in a similar position throughout this region and  elsewhere in Arizona and New Mexico. From their proximity to the caves  it would seem that the cavate dwellings, and the pueblos on the  summits of the mesas in which they are found, had been inhabited by  one people; but better evidence that such is true is drawn from the  character of the architecture and the nature of the art remains common  to both.    Let us first consider the series of caves from a point opposite our  camp to the promontory which forms a pinnacle at the mouth of the  first of the two side caverns--a row of caves the entrances to which  are shown in the accompanying illustration (plate XCII). I have  lettered these rooms, as indicated by their entrances, _a_ to _l_,  beginning with the opening on the left.    The rock in which these caves have been hewn is very soft, and almost  white in color, save for a slightly reddish brown stratum just below  the line of entrances to the cavate chambers. Although, as a general  thing, the wall of the cliff is almost perpendicular, and the caves at  points inaccessible, entrance to the majority of them can be effected  by mounting the heaps of small stones forming the debris, which has  fallen even to the bed of the river at various places, and by  following a ledge which connects the line of entrances. The easiest  approach mounts a steep decline, not far from the promontory at the  lower level of the line, which conducts to a ledge running along in  front of the caves about 150 feet above the bed of the stream. Roughly  speaking, this ledge is about 100 feet below the summit of the cliff.  It was impossible to reach several of the rooms, and it is probable  that when the caves were inhabited access to any one of them was even  more difficult than at present.    Judging from the number of rooms, the cliffs on the left bank of the  Verde must have had a considerable population when inhabited. These  caverns, no doubt, swarmed with human beings, and their inaccessible  position furnished the inhabitants with a safe refuge from enemies, or  an advantageous outlook or observation shelter for their fields on the  opposite side of the stream. The soft rock of which the mesa is formed  is easily worked, and there are abundant evidences, from the marks of  tools employed, that the greater part of each cave was pecked out by  hand. Fragments of wood were very rarely seen in these cliff dugouts;  and although there is much adobe plastering, only in a few instances  were the mouths of the caves walled or a doorway of usual shape  present. The last room at the southern end, near the promontory at the  right of the entrance to a side canyon, has walls in front resembling  those of true cliff houses and pueblos in the Red-rock country farther  northward, as will be shown in subsequent pages.    This group of cavate dwellings, while a good example of the cavern  type of ruins, is so closely associated, both in geographical position  and in archeological remains, with other types in Verde valley, that  we are justified in referring them to one and the same people. The  number of these troglodytic dwelling places on the Verde is very  large; indeed the mesas may be said to be fairly honeycombed with  subterranean habitations. Confined as a general thing to the softer  strata of rock, which from its character was readily excavated, they  lie side by side at the same general level, and are entered from a  projecting ledge, formed by the top of the talus which follows the  level of their entrances.    [Illustration: FIG. 245--Plan of cavate dwelling on Rio Verde]    This ledge is easily accessible in certain places from the river bed,  where stones have fallen to the base of the cliff; but at most points  no approach is possible, and in their impregnable position the  inhabitants could easily defend themselves from hostile peoples.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCII    ENTRANCES TO CAVATE RUINS]    Whether the rock had recesses in it before the caves were enlarged  would seem to be answered in the affirmative, for similar caves  without evidences of habitations were observed. These, however, are as  a rule small, and wherever available the larger caverns have been  appropriated and enlarged by stone implements, as shown by the pecking  on the walls. The enlargement of these caverns, however, would not be  a difficult task, for the rock is very soft and easily worked.    Entering one of these cavate rooms the visitor finds himself in a dark  chamber, as a rule with side openings or passageways into adjoining  rooms. Broad lateral banquettes are prominent features in the most  complicated caves, and there are many recesses and small closets or  cists.    The ramifications formed by lateral rooms are often extensive, and the  chambers communicate with others so dark that we can hardly regard  them as once inhabited. In these dimly lighted rooms the walls were  blackened with smoke, as if from former fires, and in many of the  largest the position of fireplaces could plainly be discovered. As a  type of one of the more complicated I have chosen that figured to  illustrate the arrangement of these cavate dwellings (figure 245).  Many are smaller, others have more lateral chambers, but one type is  characteristic of all.    A main room (_A_, figure 245), or that first entered from outside, is  roughly rectangular in shape, 12 feet long by 6 feet wide, and about 6  feet high. The floor, however, was covered with very dry debris which  had blown in from the exterior or, in some instances, fallen from the  roof. That part of the floor which was exposed shows that it was  roughly plastered, sometimes paved or formed of solid rock.    On three sides of this room there is a step 2 feet high, to platforms,  three in number, one in the rear and one on each side. These platforms  are 5, 6, and 6 feet 6 inches wide, respectively, and of the same  length as the corresponding sides of the central room. It would appear  that these platforms are characteristic architectural features of  these habitations, and we find them reproduced in some of the rooms of  the cliff houses of the Red-rocks, while Nordenskioeld has described a  kindred feature in the kivas of the Mesa Verde ruins. A somewhat  similar elevation of the floor in modern Tusayan kivas forms what may  be called the spectator's part, in front of the ladder as one  descends, and the same feature is common to many older Hopi  dwellings.[15]    Beginning with the lateral platforms (_B_, figure 245) we first note,  as we step upon it at _c_, about midway of its length, a small  circular depression in the floor of the central room extending  slightly beneath the platform, as indicated by the dotted line. It is  possible that this niche was a receptacle for important household  objects, although it may have been a fireplace.    In a corner of the right platform a round cist, partially hewn out of  the rock, was found, but its walls (_a_, figure 245) were badly broken  down by some former explorer. The floor of this recess lies below that  of the platform, while the cist itself (_D_) reminds one of the closed  or walled structures, so commonly found in the Verde,"]]]
