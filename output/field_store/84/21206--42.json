The snake was a poisonous one and the  man bitten was in great pain. The witch doctor whooped and went through  several chants but the man got worse instead of better. The witch doctor  then told the man that his wife made the snake bite him by witchery and  that she should die for the act. The natives gathered at once in  response to the witch doctor's call and the woman was executed at once.  The man bitten by the snake finally died but the witch doctor had  shifted the responsibility of his failure to help the man to his wife  who had been beheaded. The witch doctor had justified himself and the  incident was closed.    The tribe ruled by a King has two or more absolute rules. The Kings  word is law and he has the power to condemn any subject to death at any  time without trial. If he becomes angry or offended with any of his  wives a nod and a word to his bodyguard and the woman is led away to  execution. Any person of the tribe is subject to the King's will with  the exemption of the witch doctor. Executions of a different nature than  the ones described above are common occurrences. For general crimes the  culprit after being condemned to death is placed in a chair shaped very  much like the electric chairs used in American prisons in taking the  lives of the condemned. He is then tied firmly to the chair with thongs.  A pole made of a green sapling is firmly implanted in the earth nearby.  A thong is placed around the neck of the victim under the chin. The  sapling is then bent over and the other end of the thong tied to the end  of the sapling pole. The pole stretches the neck to its full length and  holds the head erect. Drums are sometimes beaten to drown the cries of  those who are to be killed. The executioner who is called a headsman  then walks forward approaching the chair from the rear. When he reaches  it he steps to the side of the victim and with a large, sharp,  long-bladed knife lops off the head of the criminal. The bodies of men  executed in this manner are buried in shallow holes dug about two feet  deep to receive their bodies.    The rank and file of the savage tribes believe explicitly [HW  correction: implicitly] in the supernatural powers of the witch doctor  and his decisions are not questioned. Not even the King of the tribe  raises a voice against him. The witch doctor is crafty enough not to  condemn any of the King's household or any one directly prominent in the  King's service. After an execution everything is quiet in a few hours  and the incident seems forgotten. The African Negroes attitude towards  the whole affair seems to be instinctive and as long as he escapes he  does not show any particular concern in his fellowman. His is of an  animal instinctive nature.    The males of the African tribes of savages have very little respect for  a woman but they demand a whole lot of courtesies from their wives,  beating them unmercifully when they feel proper respect has not been  shown them. The men hunt game and make war on other tribes and the women  do all the work. A savage warrior when not engaged in hunting or war,  sleeps a lot and smokes almost continuously during his waking hours.  Girls are bought from their parents while mere children by the payment  of so many cows, goats, etc. The King can take any woman of the tribe  whether married or single he desires to be his wife. The parents of  young girls taken to wife by the King of a tribe feel honored and fall  on their knees and thank the King for taking her.    The prince of a tribe is born a headsman and as soon as he is able to  wield a knife he is called upon to perform the duty of cutting off the  heads of criminals who are condemned to death by the King for general  crimes. Those condemned by the witch doctor for witchcraft are executed  by dismemberment or fire as described above.           *       *       *       *       *    My husband was a cannibal headsman and performed this duty of cutting  off persons heads when a boy and after being civilized in America this  feature of his early life bore so heavily upon his mind that it was  instrumental in driving him insane. By custom a prince was born a  headsman and it was compulsory that he execute criminals. He died in an  insane ward of the New Jersey State Hospital.    [Footnote 1: [HW: ]Dr. Henry M.

Andrews    [TR: Date Stamp \"AUG 4 1937\"]    JANE ARRINGTON  84 years old  302 Fowle Street  Raleigh, N. C.      I ort to be able to tell sumpin cause I wus twelve years old when dey  had de surrender right up here in Raleigh. If I live to see dis coming  December I will be eighty five years old. I was born on the 18th of  December 1852.    I belonged to Jackson May of Nash County. I wus born on de plantation  near Tar River. Jackson May never married until I wus of a great big  girl. He owned a lot of slaves; dere were eighty on de plantation before  de surrender. He married Miss Becky Wilder, sister of Sam Wilder. De  Wilders lived on a jining plantation to where I wus borned.    Jackson May had so many niggers he let Billy Williams who had a  plantation nearby have part of 'em. Marster Jackson he raised my father  and bought my mother. My mother wus named Louisa May, and my father wus  named Louis May. My mother had six chilluns, four boys and two girls.  The boys were Richard, Farro, Caeser, and Fenner. De girls Rose and  Jane. Jane, dats me.    We lived in log houses with stick an' dirt chimleys. They called 'em  the slave houses. We had chicken feather beds to sleep on an' de houses  wus good warm comfortable log houses. We had plenty of cover an' feather  pillows.    My grandmother on my mother's side told me a lot of stories 'bout  haints and how people run from 'em. Dey told me 'bout slaves dat had  been killed by dere marster's coming back and worryin' 'em. Ole Missus  Penny Williams, before Jackson May bought mother, treated some of de  slaves mighty bad. She died an' den come back an' nearly scared de  slaves to death. Grandmother told all we chillun she seed her an' knowed  her after she been dead an' come back.    John May a slave wus beat to death by Bill Stone an' Oliver May. Oliver  May wus Junius May's son. Junius May wus Jackson May's Uncle. John May  come back an' wurried both of 'em. Dey could hardly sleep arter dat. Dey  said dey could hear him hollerin' an' groanin' most all de time. Dese  white men would groan in dere sleep an' tell John to go away. Dey would  say, 'Go way John, please go away'. De other slaves wus afraid of 'em  cause de ghost of John wurried 'em so bad.    I wurked on de farm, cuttin' corn stalks and tendin' to cattle in  slavery time. Sometimes I swept de yards. I never got any money for my  work and we didn't have any patches. My brothers caught possums, coons  and sich things an' we cooked 'em in our houses. We had no parties but  we had quiltin's. We went to the white folks church, Peach Tree Church,  six miles from de plantation an' Poplar Springs Church seven miles away.  Both were missionary Baptist Churches.    There were no overseers on Jackson May's plantation. He wouldn't have  nary one. Billy Williams didn't have none. Dey had colored slave  foremen.    After wurkin' all day dere wus a task of cotton to be picked an' spun  by 'em. Dis wus two onces of cotton. Some of de slaves run away from  Bill Williams when Marster Jackson May let him have 'em to work. Dey run  away an' come home. Aunt Chaney runned away an' mother run away. Marster  Jackson May kept 'em hid cause he say dey wus not treated right. He  wouldn't let 'em have 'em back no more.    I never saw a grown slave whupped or in chains and I never saw a slave  sold. Jackson May would not sell a slave. He didn't think it right. He  kept 'em together. He had eighty head. He would let other white people  have 'em to wurk for 'em sometimes, but he would not sell none of 'em.    If dey caught a slave wid a book you knowed it meant a whuppin', but de  white chillun teached slaves secretey sometimes. Ole man Jake Rice a  slave who belonged to John Rice in Nash County wus teached by ole John  Rice's son till he had a purty good mount of larnin'.    We did not have prayer meeting at marster's plantation or anywhur.  Marster would not allow dat.    When I wus a child we played de games of three handed reels, 'Old Gray  Goose', 'All Little Gal, All Little Gal, All Little Gal remember me'. We  took hold of hands an' run round as we sang dis song.    We sang 'Old Dan Tucker'. Git outen de way, ole Dan Tucker, Sixteen  Hosses in one stable, one jumped out an' skined his nable an' so on.    Dr. Mann and Dr. Sid Harris and Dr. Fee Mann and Dr. Mathias looked  arter us when we wus sick. Mother and de other grown folks raised herbs  dat dey give us too. Chillun took a lot of salts.    Jackson May wus too rich to go to de war. Billy Williams didn't go, too  rich too, I reckons. I remember when dey said niggers had to be free. De  papers said if dey could not be freedom by good men dere would be  freedom by blood. Dey fighted an' kept on fightin' a long time. Den de  Yankees come. [HW correction: New paragraph] I heard dem beat de drum.  Marster tole us we wus free but mother an' father stayed on with  Marster. He promised 'em sumptin, but he give 'em nothin'. When de crop  wus housed dey left.    Father and mother went to Hench Stallings plantation and stayed there  one year. Then they went to Jim Webbs farm. I don't remember how long  they stayed there but round two years. They moved about an' about among  the white folks till they died. They never owned any property. They been  dead 'bout thirty years.    I married Sidney Arrington. He has been dead six years las' September.

These three learned men  began this work, but did not terminate it; it was resumed in the  year 1570 by a pupil of Herlin, named Conrad Dasypodius of  Strasburg, where he was a professor of mathematics. Dasypodius  drew the design of the clock, but its execution was confided to  two skilful mechanics of Schaffhouse, the brothers Isaac and  Josiah Habrecht; Tobias Stimmer, also of Schaffhouse, had the  charge of the paintings. This master-piece of the mechanical art  of the sixteenth century was completed in 1574; it ceased going  in 1789. As the exterior distribution of the present clock is  nearly the same as that of the old clock, we shall abstain from  describing the latter. In 1836 the corporation of the town of  Strasburg adopted the resolution of causing this curious monument  to be repaired. To Mr. Schwilgue, a distinguished mechanician of  Strasburg, his native place, this remarkable work was entrusted;  he began it the 24th of June 1838 and finished it at the end of  1842.    It is one of the most beautiful pieces of workmanship of our  age; its mechanism is entirely new and in accordance with the  present state of the science of astronomy, which as is well  known, has attained a very high degree of certainty and  exactness. Mr. Schwilgue has not made use of any of the pieces of  the old clock, which are deposited in the chapel of the  _[OE]uvre-Notre-Dame_; by comparing them with the pieces  composing the new clock, one may judge of the progress of science  and of the talents of the modern artist. M. Schwilgue preserved  of the former clock only its fine case, the paintings and  ornaments of which were carefully repaired. In this he had many  difficulties to overcome, as well for the proper arrangement of  this mechanism and lodging it in a space that was often very  limited, as for making the old signs or indications accord with  the movements of the clockwork. Of these many were marked only in  painting, and must have been renewed after a certain time, as for  instance those for the eclipses, which now by a most ingenious  mechanical combination will henceforth last for ever. The little  statues which hitherto had no articulation, are now moveable; the  twelve Apostles have been added to the former number of them. The  figure of Death, formerly on the same level with that of  Jesus-Christ, is now placed in the centre of figures representing  the four ages of life and striking the quarters of hours; the  idea of assigning this place to the image of death is assuredly a  more rational and finer one than that which prevailed in the old  distribution of the figures. Childhood strikes the first quarter;  Youth the second; Manhood the third, and Old Age the last; the  first stroke of each quarter is struck by one of the two genii  seated above the perpetual calendar; the four ages strike the  second. Whilst death strikes the hours, the second of these genii  turns over the hourglass that he holds in his hand. The image of  the Saviour stands now on a higher ground; at the hour of noon  the twelve Apostles pass bowing before him; he lifts up his hand  to bless them, and during that time, a cock, whose motions and  voice imitate nature, flaps his wings and crows three times.    Mr. Schwilgue has altered the old calendar into a perpetual one  with the addition of the feasts that vary, according to their  connexion with Easter or Advent Sundays. The dial, nine metres in  circumference, is subject to a revolution of 365 or 366 days,  according as the case may be. Mr. Schwilgue has even indicated  the suppression of the secular bissextile days. He has moreover  enriched his work by adding to it an ecclesiastic compute with  all its indications; an orrery after the Copernican system,  representing the mean tropical revolutions of each of the planets  visible to the naked eye, the phases of the moon, the eclipses of  the sun and moon, calculated for ever; the true time and the  sideral time; a new celestial globe with the procession of the  equinoxes, solar and lunary equations for the reduction of the  mean geocentric ascension and declension of the sun and moon at  true times and places. A dial placed without the church and  showing the hours and days, is put in motion by the same  mechanism of the clockwork.    The camerated roof of the back part of the chancel was formerly  covered with paintings executed in 1686 representing Dooms-day. A few  paintings only adorned till now the interior of the Cathedral,  among which the most remarkable oil-paintings, executed by  artists of Strasburg, are: the _Shepherd's Adoration_, by Guerin,  the _Laying in the tomb_, by Klein; the _Ascension_, by Heim, and  some others. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the  chancel was several times and in different ways enlarged and  disfigured by ornaments little correspondent with the elegance and  grandeur of the gothic order. Tribunes, stairs and wainscots that  formed a strange contrast with the rest of the edifice were added.  The altar, adorned in 1501, with fine figures carved in wood by  Master Nicholas of Haguenau, was changed in 1685 by order of bishop  William Egon of Fuerstenberg; that new altar, covered with a  baldachin, was destroyed by fire, and in 1765 the present one,  which has nothing in its form worthy of notice, was erected. Great  repairs were begun some years ago under the direction of the city  corporation, struck, as every body was, by the great disproportion  between the chancel and nave. It was resolved to restore the  chancel to its primitive form and arrangement, and thus to  reestablish the due proportions between that part and the rest of  this magnificent church. This great labour is now finished. Their  natural complement, as required by the style of this part of the  pile and its extensive fronts and arch-roofs, is the execution of a  certain number of monumental paintings, intrusted to two  distinguished artists, Prof. Steinle, Director of Staedel's  Institute in Frankfort a/M. and the historical painter Steinheil  in Paris, a native Alsacian. The former is charged with the  execution of the fresco-paintings in the chancel and lateral  naves, whilst the latter undertook the reestablishment of the  paintings that represent the Dooms-day on the upper wall of the  chancel, in front of the great nave. Both works, begun in 1876,  came in sight for the visitors of the Cathedral, at the end of  1878.    In restoring to this part of the edifice its former appearance,  it has highly augmented the effect produced on the inward aspect  of the Cathedral; now also may be decided the question, hitherto  doubtful, of the exact time at which the chancel was built; with  certainty, it may already be said, that it was not erected, as  was often affirmed, in the time of the emperor Charlemain.    [Illustration: Astronomical clock.]    In removing the superfetations that had taken place during these  two last centuries, and in reestablishing the architectural forms  that the wretched style then prevailing had concealed, a  succession of large ogive arches of an admirable and powerful  proportion which form the inferior part of the Apsis, and support  a gallery serving as a basis to the upper story, have come to  light. On this story, which is separated from the _cul-de-four_  (spherical vault) by a single moulding, are three large ogive  windows, the middle one of which is of colossal dimensions, and  between the columns below are in a symmetrical manner placed, on  each side, the doors of the treasury and chapter-room, and in the  centre lies the bishop's throne, the niched vault of which is  still more richly decorated; between the intermedial arches are  the staircase doors leading to the gallery.    The _Apsis_ is not very deep and terminates by a segment, cut out  of a masonry work outwardly square; entirely devoted to the  sanctuary, it only contains the high-altar, the twenty four  stalls of the chapter and a necessary room to perform divine  worship. In 1878 an accompanying organ has been erected on the  left side. This beautiful instrument, made by Mr. Merklin, the  skilful organ-builder of Lyons, is a masterpiece of art and taste  that enhances indeed the chancel of the Cathedral. In front and a  few steps lower down lies the chancel, destined to the inferior  clergy and choristers. This chancel surmounted by a large  octagonal cupola, the external part of which was struck by  lightning in 1759, is placed at the intersection of the transepts  and nave; open and lighted on all sides, one can admire the  boldness and majesty of the columns and basis that support the  arched roofs. The cripta or subterranean place, extending under  the whole length of the chancel, is worthy of notice; it has also  been recently restored. It is of an older order than the  constructions of Erwin of Steinbach; it is perhaps the remainder  of the edifice erected by bishop Werner, at the beginning of the  eleventh century; the shape of the pillars, their cubical tops  or chapters, the arches exclusively semi-circular, bring us back  to those times. This crypta, that remained unimpaired during all  the changes which the Cathedral must have undergone in the course  of so many centuries, forms a nave with two arch-vaults and a  round chancel. All along the walls of the nave are stone benches.  Four of the inner pillars have still hinges affixed to them which  prove that this portion of the crypta could be closed by a double  door. At its entrance is what is called the holy tomb, a very  ancient group of figures representing Jesus Christ and his  disciples on the mount of Olives, at the moment when the soldiers  are going to seize the Lord: this group comes"]]]
