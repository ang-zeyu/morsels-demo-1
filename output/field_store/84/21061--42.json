Work carried out  entirely in one stitch has a certain unity and character that is very  pleasing. There are a great number of stitches in existence, that is, if  each slight variation has a different name assigned to it. The names  are sometimes misleading, for often the same stitch is known by several  different ones; descriptive names have where possible been chosen for  those discussed in the following pages.    A worker may find it useful to keep by her a sampler with the most  characteristic stitches placed upon it; a glance at this will be  suggestive when she is in doubt as to which to use, for it is often  difficult to recollect just the right and most suitable one at a  moment's notice. It is necessary to learn only the main varieties, for  each individual worker can adapt, combine, and invent variations to suit  a special purpose.    The direction of the stitch is important; tone, if not colour, can be  very much altered by change in direction; also growth and form can be  suggested by it; for instance, lines going across a stem are not usually  so satisfactory as those running the length of it; these suggesting  growth better. Folds of drapery are often explained by direction of the  lines of stitching quite as much as by gradation of colour.    With reference to the stitches described in the following chapters, the  worker is advised to try to work them by simply examining the diagrams,  and, if in any difficulty, then to refer to the printed description, for  such directions are apt to be tedious. The simplest way to master these  is to let some one read them out step by step, and to work from  dictation. It should be remembered that the use of a particular thread  often makes or mars a stitch, some requiring soft silks to show them to  advantage, whilst others may need a stoutly twisted thread.    Chain stitch is universal, and one of the most ancient of stitches. It  is the most commonly used of a group that might be described as linked  stitches. Much beautiful work has been carried out entirely in it, and  when a monotonous even line is required, this is a most suitable stitch  to employ. It is equally in request for outline and filling in, and its  chain-like adaptability makes it specially good for following out curved  forms or spiral lines. Tambour stitch is practically the same in result,  though worked in quite a different manner, for it is carried out in a  frame with a fine crochet hook, instead of with a needle. This makes it  quicker in execution, but more mechanical in appearance, so it is not to  be as much recommended.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]    To work chain stitch (fig. 25) bring the needle through at the top of  the traced line, hold the working thread down towards the left with the  thumb, insert the needle at the point where the thread has just come  through and bring it up on the traced line about one-sixteenth of an  inch further along, draw the thread through over the held down thread.  It should show a neat line of back-stitching on the reverse side. The  chain can be made broader by inserting the needle a little to the right,  instead of at the exact point where the last thread came through. Care  must be taken in the working not to draw the thread too tightly, as this  stitch is inclined to pucker the material, especially when it is worked  in curved lines.    A flower and leaf worked with a solid filling of chain stitch are shown  in fig. 26. The dark outline of the flower is in back stitch, the centre  a mass of French knots, and the stem in stem stitch. By working the  petals in curved lines in this way the shape is well suggested, and the  play of light on the curves is particularly happy, especially if the  thread used is silk or gold. Another slight variation from this would be  to work the lines of chain stitch in different shades of colour, and so  get each petal gradually either lighter or darker towards its base; this  gives a very pretty effect. Fig. 27 shows an oak leaf carried out in  this way, the lines upon it indicate the way in which the stitches  would be worked. The rule in solid fillings is to work from the outside  inwards where possible, and thus make sure of a good outline.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    In the Victoria and Albert Museum there is a white linen dress[1]  daintily embroidered in chain stitch. It is an excellent example of a  kind of design suitable to this stitch; the leaves and flowers are  carried out in lines of chain stitch following the outline, and in these  lines use is made of strongly contrasting colour to both show up the  form better, and also decorate it. The leaf in fig. 28 is in style  somewhat similar to this, and is intended to be carried out in two  distinct colours.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]    [Illustration: Fig. 28.]    Chain stitches can be worked singly; they are used in this way as a  powdering over a background. Sometimes they may be seen conventionally  suggesting the small feathers on the shoulder of a bird's wing by being  dotted over it at regular intervals. Fig. 29 shows how they might be  used to carry out a tiny flower, five separate stitches represent the  petals, and two more the leaves at the base; this is a simpler and more  satisfactory method than to attempt very minute forms with satin  stitches.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.]    The common chain makes a particularly neat border stitch taken in zigzag  fashion. To work this (fig. 30)--Trace two parallel lines on the  material and work the chain across from side to side at an angle of 45 deg.  to the traced lines. For further security it is well to catch down the  end of the stitch just completed with the needle as it commences the  following one. The line can be further decorated by placing a French  knot, perhaps in a contrasting colour, in each little triangular space  left by working the stitch.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.]    [Illustration: Fig. 31.]    There is an ingenious method of working ordinary chain stitch in a  chequering of two colours (fig. 31). It is quite simple to work. Thread  a needle with two different coloured threads, commence the chain stitch  in the usual way until the thread has to be placed under the point of  the needle for forming the loop. Place only one of the two threads  underneath, leaving the other on one side out of the way, then draw the  needle and thread through over the one held down. A chain stitch will  have been formed with the thread that was looped under the needle. For  the next stitch, the alternate thread is placed under, and so on, taking  each thread in turn. The thread not in use each time usually requires a  little adjustment to make it entirely disappear from the surface.    Twisted chain is worked very similarly to the ordinary chain stitch. It  has not such a decidedly looped appearance, which is sometimes an  advantage. To work it (fig. 32)--Bring the thread through at the top of  the line, hold it down under the thumb to the left, and insert the  needle to the left of the traced line, slightly below the point where  the thread has come through. Bring it out again on the traced line,  about one-eighth of an inch lower down, and draw it through over the  held down thread.    An entirely different effect can be obtained by working this stitch  much closer together, but in exactly the same way. It will then  resemble a satin stitch slightly raised on one side. This is known as  rope stitch and is at times very useful.    [Illustration: Fig. 32.]    [Illustration: Fig. 33.]    Open chain stitch makes a good broad line; it looks best when worked  with a stout thread. To carry out the stitch (fig. 33)--Trace two  parallel lines upon the material, about one-eighth of an inch apart,  and bring the thread through at the top of the left-hand one. Hold the  thread down with the thumb and insert the needle exactly opposite on the  other line, bring it up one-eighth of an inch lower down and draw the  thread through over the held down part, leaving a rather slack loop upon  the material. Then insert the needle on the first line again, inside  the slack loop, and bring it out one-eighth of an inch below. Repeat  this on each side alternately. Fig. 34 is a drawing from a piece of  white linen work in which the open chain stitch is used in combination  with other stitches. This figure, with its open-work centre, is repeated  diagonally over a white linen cloth exhibited in the Victoria and Albert  Museum.    [Illustration: Fig. 34.]    Braid stitch rather resembles a fancy braid laid upon the material. It  looks best when carried out with a stoutly twisted thread. To work it  (fig. 35)--Trace two parallel lines upon the material about one-eighth  of an inch apart, and bring the thread through at the right-hand end of  the lower line. Throw the thread across to the left and hold it slackly  under the thumb. Place the needle pointing towards the worker under this  held thread, then twist it round towards the left and over the held  thread until it points in the opposite direction. It will now have the  thread twisted loosely over it. Next, insert the needle on the upper  line one-eighth of an inch from the starting-point, and bring it  through on the lower line exactly underneath. Place the thumb over the  stitch in process of making and draw the thread through as the diagram  shows. It can be worked openly or more closely as preferred.    [Illustration: Fig. 35.]    [Illustration: Fig. 36.]    Cable chain is descriptively named, for, when worked with a stoutly  twisted thread, it has very much the appearance of a chain laid upon  the material, rather too much so perhaps to be a pretty embroidery  stitch. To work it (fig. 36)--Bring the needle through at the top of the  traced line, throw the thread round to the left and hold it down with  the thumb near where it has come through the material. Pass the needle  under the held down thread from left to right and draw it through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#6)"],[1," so many dead things. Well, they was lively enough on the  Monday, and now here's Thursday, is it, or no, Friday. Only to come  near the door and you'd hear them pattering up against it, and once  you opened it, dash at you, they would, as if they'd eat you. I  couldn't help thinking to myself, \"If you was bats, where should we be  this night?\" Nor you can't cresh 'em, not like a usual kind of a fly.  Well, there's something to be thankful for, if we could but learn by  it. And then this tomb, too,' she said, hastening on to her second  point to elude any chance of interruption, 'of them two poor young  lads. I say poor, and yet when I recollect myself, I was at tea with  Mrs. Simpkins, the sexton's wife, before you come, Doctor and Miss  Mary, and that's a family has been in the place, what? I daresay a  hundred years in that very house, and could put their hand on any tomb  or yet grave in all the yard and give you name and age. And his  account of that young man, Mr. Simpkins's I mean to say--_well_!' She  compressed her lips and nodded several times. 'Tell us, Mrs. Maple,'  said Mary. 'Go on,' said Uncle Oldys. 'What about him?' said I.  'Never was such a thing seen in this place, not since Queen Mary's  times and the Pope and all,' said Mrs. Maple. 'Why, do you know he  lived in this very house, him and them that was with him, and for all  I can tell in this identical room' (she shifted her feet uneasily on  the floor). 'Who was with him? Do you mean the people of the house?'  said Uncle Oldys suspiciously. 'Not to call people, Doctor, dear no,'  was the answer; 'more what he brought with him from Ireland, I believe  it was. No, the people in the house was the last to hear anything of  his goings-on. But in the town not a family but knew how he stopped  out at night: and them that was with him, why they were such as would  strip the skin from the child in its grave; and a withered heart makes  an ugly thin ghost, says Mr. Simpkins. But they turned on him at the  last, he says, and there's the mark still to be seen on the minster  door where they run him down. And that's no more than the truth, for I  got him to show it to myself, and that's what he said. A lord he was,  with a Bible name of a wicked king, whatever his godfathers could have  been thinking of.' 'Saul was the name,' said Uncle Oldys. 'To be sure  it was Saul, Doctor, and thank you; and now isn't it King Saul that we  read of raising up the dead ghost that was slumbering in its tomb till  he disturbed it, and isn't that a strange thing, this young lord to  have such a name, and Mr. Simpkins's grandfather to see him out of his  window of a dark night going about from one grave to another in the  yard with a candle, and them that was with him following through the  grass at his heels: and one night him to come right up to old Mr.  Simpkins's window that gives on the yard and press his face up against  it to find out if there was any one in the room that could see him:  and only just time there was for old Mr. Simpkins to drop down like,  quiet, just under the window and hold his breath, and not stir till he  heard him stepping away again, and this rustling-like in the grass  after him as he went, and then when he looked out of his window in the  morning there was treadings in the grass and a dead man's bone. Oh, he  was a cruel child for certain, but he had to pay in the end, and  after.' 'After?' said Uncle Oldys, with a frown. 'Oh yes, Doctor,  night after night in old Mr. Simpkins's time, and his son, that's our  Mr. Simpkins's father, yes, and our own Mr. Simpkins too. Up against  that same window, particular when they've had a fire of a chilly  evening, with his face right on the panes, and his hands fluttering  out, and his mouth open and shut, open and shut, for a minute or more,  and then gone off in the dark yard. But open the window at such times,  no, that they dare not do, though they could find it in their heart to  pity the poor thing, that pinched up with the cold, and seemingly  fading away to a nothink as the years passed on. Well, indeed, I  believe it is no more than the truth what our Mr. Simpkins says on his  own grandfather's word, \"A withered heart makes an ugly thin ghost.\"'  'I daresay,' said Uncle Oldys suddenly: so suddenly that Mrs. Maple  stopped short. 'Thank you. Come away, all of you.' 'Why, _Uncle_,'  said Mary, 'are you not going to open the press after all?' Uncle  Oldys blushed, actually blushed. 'My dear,' he said, 'you are at  liberty to call me a coward, or applaud me as a prudent man, whichever  you please. But I am neither going to open that press nor that chest  of drawers myself, nor am I going to hand over the keys to you or to  any other person. Mrs. Maple, will you kindly see about getting a man  or two to move those pieces of furniture into the garret?' 'And when  they do it, Mrs. Maple,' said Mary, who seemed to me--I did not then  know why--more relieved than disappointed by her uncle's decision, 'I  have something that I want put with the rest; only quite a small  packet.'    \"We left that curious room not unwillingly, I think. Uncle Oldys's  orders were carried out that same day. And so,\" concludes Mr.  Spearman, \"Whitminster has a Bluebeard's chamber, and, I am rather  inclined to suspect, a Jack-in-the-box, awaiting some future occupant  of the residence of the senior prebendary.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Apparently the ichneumon fly (_Ophion obscurum_), and not  the true sawfly, is meant.]          THE DIARY OF MR. POYNTER          THE DIARY OF MR. POYNTER      The sale-room of an old and famous firm of book auctioneers in London  is, of course, a great meeting-place for collectors, librarians,  dealers: not only when an auction is in progress, but perhaps even  more notably when books that are coming on for sale are upon view. It  was in such a sale-room that the remarkable series of events began  which were detailed to me not many months ago by the person whom they  principally affected, namely, Mr. James Denton, M.A., F.S.A., etc.,  etc., some time of Trinity Hall, now, or lately, of Rendcomb Manor in  the county of Warwick.    He, on a certain spring day not many years since, was in London for a  few days upon business connected principally with the furnishing of  the house which he had just finished building at Rendcomb. It may be a  disappointment to you to learn that Rendcomb Manor was new; that I  cannot help. There had, no doubt, been an old house; but it was not  remarkable for beauty or interest. Even had it been, neither beauty  nor interest would have enabled it to resist the disastrous fire which  about a couple of years before the date of my story had razed it to  the ground. I am glad to say that all that was most valuable in it had  been saved, and that it was fully insured. So that it was with a  comparatively light heart that Mr. Denton was able to face the task of  building a new and considerably more convenient dwelling for himself  and his aunt who constituted his whole _menage_.    Being in London, with time on his hands, and not far from the  sale-room at which I have obscurely hinted, Mr. Denton thought that he  would spend an hour there upon the chance of finding, among that  portion of the famous Thomas collection of MSS., which he knew to be  then on view, something bearing upon the history or topography of his  part of Warwickshire.    He turned in accordingly, purchased a catalogue and ascended to the  sale-room, where, as usual, the books were disposed in cases and some  laid out upon the long tables. At the shelves, or sitting about at the  tables, were figures, many of whom were familiar to him. He exchanged  nods and greetings with several, and then settled down to examine his  catalogue and note likely items. He had made good progress through  about two hundred of the five hundred lots--every now and then rising  to take a volume from the shelf and give it a cursory glance--when a  hand was laid on his shoulder, and he looked up. His interrupter was  one of those intelligent men with a pointed beard and a flannel shirt,  of whom the last quarter of the nineteenth century was, it seems to  me, very prolific.    It is no part of my plan to repeat the whole conversation which ensued  between the two. I must content myself with stating that it largely  referred to common acquaintances, e.g., to the nephew of Mr. Denton's  friend who had recently married and settled in Chelsea, to the  sister-in-law of Mr. Denton's friend who had been seriously  indisposed, but was now better, and to a piece of china which Mr.  Denton's friend had purchased some months before at a price much below  its true value. From which you will rightly infer that the  conversation was rather in the nature of a monologue. In due time,  however, the friend bethought himself that Mr. Denton was there for a  purpose, and said he, \"What are you looking out for in particular? I  don't think there's much in this lot.\" \"Why, I thought there might be  some Warwickshire collections, but I don't see anything under Warwick  in the catalogue.\" \"No, apparently not,\" said the friend. \"All the  same, I believe I noticed something like a Warwickshire diary. What  was the name again? Drayton? Potter? Painter--either a P or a D, I  feel sure.\" He turned over the leaves quickly. \"Yes, here it is.  Poynter. Lot 486. That might interest you. There are the books, I  think: out on the table. Some one has been looking at them. Well, I  must be getting on. Good-bye, you'll look us up, won't you? Couldn't  you come this afternoon? we've got a little music about four. Well,  then, when you're next in town.\" He went off. Mr. Denton looked at his  watch and found to his confusion that he could spare no more than a  moment before retrieving his luggage and going for the train. The  moment was just enough to show him that there were four largish  volumes of the diary--that it concerned the years about 1710, and"]]]
