I think we might drive round to the  offices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day's work to a  conclusion.\"      Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after  breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our  proceedings of the day before.  The professional shook his head over  our confessed burglary.    \"We can't do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,\" said he. \"No  wonder you get results that are beyond us.  But some of these days  you'll go too far, and you'll find yourself and your friend in trouble.\"    \"For England, home and beauty--eh, Watson?  Martyrs on the altar of our  country.  But what do you think of it, Mycroft?\"    \"Excellent, Sherlock!  Admirable!  But what use will you make of it?\"    Holmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table.    \"Have you seen Pierrot's advertisement to-day?\"    \"What?  Another one?\"    \"Yes, here it is:    \"To-night.  Same hour.  Same place.  Two taps.  Most vitally important.  Your own safety at stake.    \"Pierrot.    \"By George!\" cried Lestrade.  \"If he answers that we've got him!\"    \"That was my idea when I put it in.  I think if you could both make it  convenient to come with us about eight o'clock to Caulfield Gardens we  might possibly get a little nearer to a solution.\"    One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his  power of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his  thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he  could no longer work to advantage.  I remember that during the whole of  that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had  undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus.  For my own part I had  none of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared  to be interminable.  The great national importance of the issue, the  suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we  were trying--all combined to work upon my nerve.  It was a relief to me  when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition.  Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester  Road Station.  The area door of Oberstein's house had been left open  the night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes  absolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in  and open the hall door.  By nine o'clock we were all seated in the  study, waiting patiently for our man.    An hour passed and yet another.  When eleven struck, the measured beat  of the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes.  Lestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a  minute at their watches.  Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids  half shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a  sudden jerk.    \"He is coming,\" said he.    There had been a furtive step past the door.  Now it returned. We heard  a shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker.  Holmes rose, motioning us to remain seated.  The gas in the hall was a  mere point of light.  He opened the outer door, and then as a dark  figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it.  \"This way!\" we  heard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us.  Holmes had  followed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and  alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room.  Before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and  Holmes standing with his back against it.  The man glared round him,  staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor.  With the shock, his  broad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his  lips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome  delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.    Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.    \"You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,\" said he.  \"This was  not the bird that I was looking for.\"    \"Who is he?\" asked Mycroft eagerly.    \"The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the  Submarine Department.  Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is  coming to.  I think that you had best leave his examination to me.\"    We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa.  Now our prisoner sat  up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand  over his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.    \"What is this?\" he asked.  \"I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.\"    \"Everything is known, Colonel Walter,\" said Holmes.  \"How an English  gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension.  But your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within  our knowledge.  So also are the circumstances connected with the death  of young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small  credit for repentance and confession, since there are still some  details which we can only learn from your lips.\"    The man groaned and sank his face in his hands.  We waited, but he was  silent.    \"I can assure you,\" said Holmes, \"that every essential is already  known.  We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an  impress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into  a correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the  advertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph.  We are aware that you  went down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were  seen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous  reason to suspect you.  He saw your theft, but could not give the  alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your  brother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good  citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at  your heels until you reached this very house.  There he intervened, and  then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more  terrible crime of murder.\"    \"I did not!  I did not!  Before God I swear that I did not!\" cried our  wretched prisoner.    \"Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon  the roof of a railway carriage.\"    \"I will.  I swear to you that I will.  I did the rest.  I confess it.  It was just as you say.  A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid.  I  needed the money badly.  Oberstein offered me five thousand.  It was to  save myself from ruin.  But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.\"    \"What happened, then?\"    \"He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe.  I  never knew it until I was at the very door.  It was thick fog, and one  could not see three yards.  I had given two taps and Oberstein had come  to the door.  The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were  about to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver.  He  always carried it with him.  As West forced his way after us into the  house Oberstein struck him on the head.  The blow was a fatal one.  He  was dead within five minutes.  There he lay in the hall, and we were at  our wit's end what to do.  Then Oberstein had this idea about the  trains which halted under his back window.  But first he examined the  papers which I had brought.  He said that three of them were essential,  and that he must keep them.  'You cannot keep them,' said I.  'There  will be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.'  'I must  keep them,' said he, 'for they are so technical that it is impossible  in the time to make copies.' 'Then they must all go back together  to-night,' said I.  He thought for a little, and then he cried out that  he had it. 'Three I will keep,' said he.  'The others we will stuff  into the pocket of this young man.  When he is found the whole business  will assuredly be put to his account.'  I could see no other way out of  it, so we did as he suggested.  We waited half an hour at the window  before a train stopped.  It was so thick that nothing could be seen,  and we had no difficulty in lowering West's body on to the train.  That  was the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.\"    \"And your brother?\"    \"He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think  that he suspected.  I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know,  he never held up his head again.\"    There was silence in the room.  It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.    \"Can you not make reparation?  It would ease your conscience, and  possibly your punishment.\"    \"What reparation can I make?\"    \"Where is Oberstein with the papers?\"    \"I do not know.\"    \"Did he give you no address?\"    \"He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually  reach him.\"    \"Then reparation is still within your power,\" said Sherlock Holmes.    \"I will do anything I can.  I owe this fellow no particular good-will.  He has been my ruin and my downfall.\"    \"Here are paper and pen.  Sit at this desk and write to my dictation.  Direct the envelope to the address given.  That is right.  Now the  letter:    \"Dear Sir:    \"With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now  that one essential detail is missing.  I have a tracing which will make  it complete.  This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I  must ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds.  I will not  trust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes.  I  would come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the  country at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the  smoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday.  Remember  that only English notes, or gold, will be taken.    \"That will do very well.  I shall be very much surprised if it does not  fetch our man.\"    And it did!  It is a matter of history--that secret history of a nation  which is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public  chronicles--that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime,  came "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

I ne'er      Can see a smile, unless in some broad banquet's      Intoxicating glare, when the buffoons                              440      Have gorged themselves up to equality,      Or I have quaffed me down to their abasement.      Myrrha, I can hear all these things, these names,      Lord--King--Sire--Monarch--nay, time was I prized them;      That is, I suffered them--from slaves and nobles;      But when they falter from the lips I love,      The lips which have been pressed to mine, a chill      Comes o'er my heart, a cold sense of the falsehood      Of this my station, which represses feeling      In those for whom I have felt most, and makes me                   450      Wish that I could lay down the dull tiara,      And share a cottage on the Caucasus      With thee--and wear no crowns but those of flowers.        _Myr._ Would that we could!        _Sar._                     And dost _thou_ feel this?--Why?        _Myr._ Then thou wouldst know what thou canst never know.        _Sar._ And that is----        _Myr._                  The true value of a heart;      At least, a woman's.        _Sar._               I have proved a thousand--A      thousand, and a thousand.        _Myr._                   Hearts?        _Sar._                          I think so.        _Myr._ Not one! the time may come thou may'st.        _Sar._                                          It will.      Hear, Myrrha; Salemenes has declared--                             460      Or why or how he hath divined it, Belus,      Who founded our great realm, knows more than I--      But Salemenes hath declared my throne      In peril.        _Myr._    He did well.        _Sar._                And say'st _thou_ so?      Thou whom he spurned so harshly, and now dared[g]      Drive from our presence with his savage jeers,      And made thee weep and blush?        _Myr._                        I should do both      More frequently, and he did well to call me      Back to my duty. But thou spakest of peril      Peril to thee----        _Sar._            Aye, from dark plots and snares                  470      From Medes--and discontented troops and nations.      I know not what--a labyrinth of things--      A maze of muttered threats and mysteries:      Thou know'st the man--it is his usual custom.      But he is honest. Come, we'll think no more on't--      But of the midnight festival.        _Myr._                       'Tis time      To think of aught save festivals. Thou hast not      Spurned his sage cautions?        _Sar._                     What?--and dost thou fear?        _Myr._ Fear!--I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death?      A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom?                  480        _Sar._ Then wherefore dost thou turn so pale?        _Myr._                                         I love.        _Sar._ And do not I? I love thee far--far more      Than either the brief life or the wide realm,      Which, it may be, are menaced;--yet I blench not.        _Myr._ That means thou lovest nor thyself nor me;      For he who loves another loves himself,      Even for that other's sake. This is too rash:      Kingdoms and lives are not to be so lost.        _Sar._ Lost!--why, who is the aspiring chief who dared      Assume to win them?        _Myr._             Who is he should dread                          490      To try so much? When he who is their ruler      Forgets himself--will they remember him?        _Sar._ Myrrha!        _Myr._        Frown not upon me: you have smiled      Too often on me not to make those frowns      Bitterer to bear than any punishment      Which they may augur.--King, I am your subject!      Master, I am your slave! Man, I have loved you!--      Loved you, I know not by what fatal weakness,      Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs--      A slave, and hating fetters--an Ionian,                            500      And, therefore, when I love a stranger, more      Degraded by that passion than by chains!      Still I have loved you. If that love were strong      Enough to overcome all former nature,      Shall it not claim the privilege to save you?        _Sar._ _Save_ me, my beauty! Thou art very fair,      And what I seek of thee is love--not safety.        _Myr._ And without love where dwells security?        _Sar._ I speak of woman's love.        _Myr._                         The very first      Of human life must spring from woman's breast,                     510      Your first small words are taught you from her lips,      Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs      Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,      When men have shrunk from the ignoble care      Of watching the last hour of him who led them.        _Sar._ My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music:      The very chorus of the tragic song      I have heard thee talk of as the favourite pastime      Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not--calm thee.        _Myr._ I weep not.--But I pray thee, do not speak                  520      About my fathers or their land.        _Sar._                          Yet oft      Thou speakest of them.        _Myr._                 True--true: constant thought      Will overflow in words unconsciously;      But when another speaks of Greeks, it wounds me.        _Sar._ Well, then, how wouldst thou _save_ me, as thou saidst?        _Myr._ By teaching thee to save thyself, and not      Thyself alone, but these vast realms, from all      The rage of the worst war--the war of brethren.        _Sar._ Why, child, I loathe all war, and warriors;      I live in peace and pleasure: what can man                         530      Do more?        _Myr._       Alas! my Lord, with common men      There needs too oft the show of war to keep      The substance of sweet peace; and, for a king,      'Tis sometimes better to be feared than loved.        _Sar._ And I have never sought but for the last.        _Myr._ And now art neither.        _Sar._                      Dost _thou_ say so, Myrrha?        _Myr._ I speak of civic popular love, _self_-love,      Which means that men are kept in awe and law,      Yet not oppressed--at least they must not think so,      Or, if they think so, deem it necessary,                           540      To ward off worse oppression, their own passions.      A King of feasts, and flowers, and wine, and revel,      And love, and mirth, was never King of Glory.        _Sar._ Glory! what's that?        _Myr._                     Ask of the Gods thy fathers.        _Sar._ They cannot answer; when the priests speak for them,      'Tis for some small addition to the temple.        _Myr._ Look to the annals of thine Empire's founders.        _Sar._ They are so blotted o'er with blood, I cannot.      But what wouldst have? the Empire _has been_ founded.      I cannot go on multiplying empires.                                550        _Myr._ Preserve thine own.        _Sar._                     At least, I will enjoy it.      Come, Myrrha, let us go on to the Euphrates:      The hour invites, the galley is prepared,      And the pavilion, decked for our return,      In fit adornment for the evening banquet,      Shall blaze with beauty and with light, until      It seems unto the stars which are above us      Itself an opposite star; and we will sit      Crowned with fresh flowers like----        _Myr._                             Victims.        _Sar._                                     No, like sovereigns,      The Shepherd Kings of patriarchal times,                           560      Who knew no brighter gems than summer wreaths,[h]      And none but tearless triumphs. Let us on.                                  _Enter_ PANIA.        _Pan._ May the King live for ever!        _Sar._                           Not an hour      Longer than he can love. How my soul hates      This language, which makes life itself a lie,      Flattering dust with eternity.[i] Well, Pania!      Be brief.        _Pan._      I am charged by Salemenes to      Reiterate his prayer unto the King,      That for this day, at least, he will not "]]]
