Much  picturesqueness has been sacrificed to make these changes. The portion  of this transept to the north of the turret was added about the middle  of the fourteenth century to form the chantry founded by Bembre, who  was dean from 1350-1361. This part contains, besides the large window,  two smaller two-light windows, which look out respectively to the east  and west. The tracery in these is almost entirely modern. Beyond the  transept is the wall of the north choir aisle. This stands farther to  the north than the wall of the nave aisle; in fact, it is in a line with  the original north end of the Norman transept. In this wall, close to  the transept, is a small round-headed doorway. And, farther to the east,  is another larger pointed doorway between the second and third windows  of the choir aisle, counting from the transept eastward. This doorway is  enclosed by a triangular moulding very plain in character, but none of  it is original. The three windows are each of two lights. The tracery  of these three is alike, but differs from that of the windows in the  nave aisle. The east window of the north aisle is of five lights. The  enclosing arch is not very pointed--much less so than in the narrower  windows of the aisles--and each light runs up through the head of the  window. These and the corresponding south choir aisle windows are late  Decorated work.    [Illustration: THE EAST WINDOW.  (From Parker's \"Introduction to Gothic Architecture.\")]    Unfortunately the churchyard does not extend to the east of the church.  A narrow footway, bounded to the east by cottages and garden walls,  renders it impossible to photograph the east window of the choir. This  is a most interesting one; and has been figured in most books on  architecture. It consists externally of three lancets enclosed in a  peculiar way by weather moulding; this rises separately over the head of  each lancet, and between the windows runs in a horizontal line and is  continued to the square corner buttresses. Within this moulding, and  over the heads of each lancet, there is an opening pierced: the central  one is a quatrefoil, while the other two have six points. These openings  are a very early example of plate tracery, which was fully developed in  the Early Decorated style. This window belongs to the Early English  period, and may be dated about 1220. There will be occasion to refer to  this window again when speaking of the interior of the church. The south  choir aisle has a five-light east window closely corresponding to the  window of the north aisle, and on the south two three-light windows. In  these, as in the east aisle windows, the lights are carried up through  the heads. There is no doorway giving access to this aisle from the  outside.    The angle between the choir aisle and south transept is filled up with  the vestry and the library above it. The south wall of this projects  beyond the wall of the south transept. This vestry is of Decorated date,  possibly rather later than the other Decorated work in the minster. The  upper storey forms the library. Its walls are finished at the top by a  plain parapet which conceals the flat roof. At the south-western angle  is an octagonal turret staircase, capped by a pyramidal roof rising from  within a battlemented parapet, and terminating in a carved finial. This  is of Perpendicular character. From the sharpness of the stone at the  coigns it would seem that very extensive restoration, if not absolute  rebuilding, of the walls was carried on in this part of the church.  The south transept is rather shorter than that on the north side; but,  unlike it, all the walls up to the level of the window are of Norman  date. The string courses on the western side are worthy of close  attention. One which runs under the south window is continued round the  Perpendicular buttresses at the south-west angle, and then again joins  the original course on the western face and runs to within a few feet  of the nave aisle, where it abruptly terminates. Above this for several  feet the walls have the same character as below; then the character  changes, and this change probably marks the junction of the Norman with  the Decorated work, which was added when the Norman chapel, which  occupied the lower part of what is now the south end of the transept,  was incorporated in the transept. Vertically above the termination of  the string course just mentioned, but at a considerably higher level,  another string course abruptly begins and runs along the wall, until it  passes within the roof of the nave aisle. The south end of this shows  the length to which the original Norman transept extended before the  walls of the chapel to the south were carried up in the fourteenth  century to form the addition to the transept. In the southern wall of  this new transept was placed a large five-light decorated window. In  this, as in several of the other Decorated windows already described,  the lights run up to the enclosing arch above. The tracery of this  window, as it now exists, dates back only to the time when the church  was restored in the middle of the nineteenth century. Up to 1891 the  side walls were about two feet lower than at present, and the gable more  obtuse. At the summit of the old gable stood a block of masonry carrying  a sundial; this, when the transept was altered, was removed, the new  gable being finished with a cross. A pillar was built in the churchyard  to the south of the western tower in 1894, and on it the block from the  transept bearing the sundial was placed. This sundial has two dates on  it--1696 and 1752, marking, no doubt, the year of its original erection  and of some subsequent repair. It is noteworthy that the figures used in  these two dates differ in character,--the eighteenth-century carver who  incised the later date not thinking it incumbent on him to make his  figures match those of his predecessor. The three aisle windows between  the south transept and the south porch are two-light Decorated windows  with tracery, some of it original, corresponding to that of those on the  opposite side in the north aisle.    The #South Porch# is small, and the side walls do not project far  from the aisle. Above the arch is a carving of a lamb much weathered,  and on the gable stands a fragment of a cross. The gates beneath the  outer arch are kept locked save on Sundays, as are frequently the gates  in the railings surrounding the churchyard to the south of the minster,  which is divided from the churchyard on the north side by the church  itself and by railings at the east and west ends of it. To the west of  the porch are two more two-light windows, corresponding in character  with the windows opposite in the north aisle. The clerestory windows  of the nave are of Perpendicular date, fifteenth-century work, and have  not any beauty. Each has three foliated lights under a round-headed  moulding. Above each of these three there are two lights, all enclosed  within a rectangular label. The nave roof is higher than the choir roof.  Its aisles have lean-to roofs, whereas the choir aisles are wider and  have gable roofs: hence the clerestory windows of the choir, modern  lancets, are not visible from the outside.    The #Western Tower# is of four stages, with octagonal buttresses at  each corner, decreasing in cross section at each course. Of these the  north-eastern one contains the stairs leading to the top of the tower,  the others are solid. These are crowned with sharp pyramidal turrets.  In the lowest stage on the western face is a doorway which for some time  was stopped up to strengthen the tower, but which was opened again at  the general restoration. Above this is the west window of six lights,  Perpendicular in character but of nineteenth-century date. The third  stage--the ringing room within is lighted by four small windows: that in  the west wall is a quatrefoil, those on the north and south have single  lights foliated at the head; the original one in the east wall was  covered when the nave roof was raised, and a plain opening was made in  the wall farther to the south. Above this is the belfry, with two pairs  of two-light windows on each face: these are divided by transoms, and  the arches at the tops are four centred. These windows are, of course,  not glazed, but are furnished with louvre-boards. The tower is finished  with a battlemented parapet. Just outside the easternmost window on the  north face, and below the transom, stands a figure now dressed in a coat  of painted lead, representing a soldier in the uniform of the early part  of the nineteenth century. He holds a hammer in each hand, with which he  strikes the quarters on two bells beside him. He is known by the name of  the \"Jackman\" or \"Quarter Jack.\" There are no windows at the west ends  of the nave aisles; but, as on the south side so on the north, there are  between the tower and the porch two two-light Decorated windows in the  wall of the aisle.    [Illustration: THE WESTERN TOWER.]    The level of the churchyards, as in the case with most old  burying-grounds, is considerably above the level of the floor of the  church. Hence steps have to be descended on entering the porches, and  again in passing from the porches into the church. On the south side  some levelling of the ground has been done, and the upright head-stones  have been laid flat, but the altar tombs have been allowed to remain as  they were. There are few trees in the churchyard to impede the view of  the building; those there are, are as yet small, and serve only to  pleasantly break the bareness of the ground without hiding the  architectural features of the building.          CHAPTER III    THE INTERIOR      The North Porch, which no doubt from the days of its erection in the  fourteenth century has formed the chief entrance into the church, is  opposite to the westernmost Norman bay of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#6)"],[1," wife.          BOOK XI.          Scarcely had king Nala parted--Damayanti now refreshed,      Wakened up, the slender-waisted--timorous in the desert wood.      When she did not see her husband--overpowered with grief and pain,      Loud she shriek'd in her first anguish--\"Where art thou, Nishadha's king?      Mighty king! my soul-protector--O, my lord! desert'st thou me.      Oh, I'm lost! undone for ever--helpless in the wild wood left;      Faithful once to every duty--wert thou not, and true in word.      Art thou faithful to thy promise--to desert me thus in sleep.      Could'st thou then depart, forsaking--thy devoted, constant wife;      Her in sooth that never wronged thee--wronged indeed, but not by her.      Keep'st thou thus thy solemn promise--oh, unfaithful lord of men,      There, when all the gods were present--plighted to thy wedded wife?      Death is but decreed to mortals--at its own appointed time,      Hence one moment, thus deserted[71]--one brief moment do I live.--      But thou'st had thy sport--enough then--now desist, O king of men,      Mock not thou a trembling woman--show thee to me, O my lord!      Yes, I see thee, there I see thee--hidden as thou think'st from sight,      In the rushes why conceal thee?--answer me, why speak'st thou not.      Wherefore now ungentle stay'st thou--like to one forsworn, aloof?      Wherefore wilt thou not approach me--to console me in my woe?      For myself I will not sorrow--nor for aught to me befalls.      Thou art all alone, my husband,--I will only mourn for thee.      How will't fare with thee, my Nala--thirsting, famished, faint with toil.      Nor beholding me await thee--underneath the trees at eve.\"      Then, in all her depth of anguish--with her trouble as on fire,      Hither, thither, went she weeping--all around she went and wailed.      Now springs up the desolate princess--now falls down in prostrate grief;      Now she pines in silent sorrow--now she shrieks and wails aloud.      So consumed with inward misery--ever sighing more and more,      Spake at length king Bhima's daughter--spake the still devoted wife:      \"He, by whose dire imprecation--Nala this dread suffering bears,      May he far surpass in suffering--all that Nala suffers now,      May the evil one, to evil--who the blameless Nala drives,      Smitten by a curse as fatal--live a dark unblessed life.\"      Thus her absent lord lamenting--that high-minded raja's queen,      Every-where her lord went seeking--in the satyr-haunted wood.[72]      Like a maniac, Bhima's daughter--wandered wailing here and there;      And \"alas! alas! my husband\"--every-where her cry was heard.      Her beyond all measure wailing--like the osprey screaming shrill,      Miserably still deploring--still renewing her lament.      Suddenly king Bhima's daughter--as she wandered near his lair,      Seized a huge gigantic serpent--in his raging famine fierce.      In the grasp of that fierce serpent--round about with terror girt,      Not herself she pities only--pities she Nishadha's king.      \"O my guardian, thus unguarded--in this savage forest seized,      Seized by this terrific serpent--wherefore art not thou at hand?      How will't be, when thou rememberest--once again thy faithful wife,      From this dreadful curse delivered--mind, and sense, and wealth returned?      When thou'rt weary, when thou'rt hungry--when thou'rt fainting with fatigue,      Who will soothe, O blameless Nala--all thy weariness, thy woe.\"        Then a huntsman as he wandered--in the forest jungle thick,      As he heard her thus bewailing--in his utmost haste drew near.      In the grasp when he beheld her--of that long-eyed serpent fell,      Instant did the nimble huntsman--rapidly as he came on,      Pierce that unresisting serpent--with a sharp and mortal shaft:      In her sight he slew that serpent--skill'd in slaughter of the chase.      Her released he from her peril--washed he then with water pure,      And with sylvan food refreshed her--and with soothing words address'd:      \"Who art thou that roam'st the forest--with the eyes of the gazelle;      How to this extreme of misery--noble lady, hast thou fallen?\"      Damayanti, by the huntsman--thus in soothing tone addressed,      All the story of her misery-told him, as it all befell;      Her, scant-clothed in half a garment--with soft swelling limbs and breast,      Form of youthful faultless beauty--and her fair and moonlike face,      And her eyes with brows dark arching--and her softly-melting speech,      Saw long time that wild beast hunter--kindled all his heart with love.      Then with winning voice that huntsman--bland beginning his discourse,      Fain with amorous speech would soothe her--she his dark intent perceived.      Damayanti, chaste and faithful,--soon as she his meaning knew,      In the transport of her anger--her indignant soul took fire.      In his wicked thought the dastard--her yet powerless to subdue,      On the unsubdued stood gazing--as like some bright flame she shone.      Damayanti, in her sorrow--of her realm, her lord bereft,      On the instant she found language--uttered loud her curse of wrath,[73]--      \"As my pure and constant spirit--swerves not from Nishadha's lord,      Instant so may this base hunter--lifeless fall upon the earth.\"      Scarce that single word was uttered--suddenly that hunter bold      Down upon the earth fell lifeless--like a lightning blasted tree.          BOOK XII.          Slain that savage wild-beast hunter--onward went the lotus-eyed,      Through the dread, and desert forest--ringing with the cricket's song;      Full of lions, pards, and tigers--stags, and buffalos, and bears,      Where all kinds of birds were flocking--and wild men and robbers dwelt.      Trees of every form and stature[74]--every foliage, every name;      Pregnant with rich mines of metal--many a mountain it enclosed,      Many a shady resonant arbour--many a deep and wondrous glen;      Many a lake, and pool, and river--birds and beasts of every shape.      She, in forms terrific round her--serpents, elves, and giants saw:[75]      Pools, and tanks of lucid water--and the shaggy tops of hills,      Flowing streams and headlong torrents--saw, and wondered at the sight.      And the princess of Vidarbha--gazed where in their countless herds,      Buffalos and bears were feeding--boars, and serpents of the wood.      Safe in virtue, bright in beauty--glorious and of high resolve,      Now alone, Vidarbha's daughter--wandering, her lost Nala sought.      Yet no fear king Bhima's daughter--for herself might deign to feel,      Travelling the dreary forest--only for her lord distressed;      Him she mourned, that noble princess--him in bitterest anguish wailed,      Every limb with sorrow trembling--stood she on a beetling rock;      \"Monarch, with broad chest capacious--monarch with the sinewy arm,      Me in this dread forest leaving--whither hast thou fled away?      Thou the holy Aswamedha--thou each sacrificial rite,      Hast performed, to me, me only--in thy holy faith thou'st failed.      That which thou, O best of husbands--in mine hearing hast declared,      Thy most solemn vow remember--call to mind thy plighted faith.      Of the swift-winged swans the language--uttered, monarch, by thy side,      That thyself, before my presence--didst renew, bethink thee well.      Thou the Vedas, thou the Angas--with the Upangas oft hast read,      Of each heaven-descended volume--one and simple is the truth.      Therefore, of thy foes the slayer!--reverence thou the sacred truth      Of thy solemn plighted promise--in my presence sworn so oft.      Am not I the loved so dearly--purely, sinlessly beloved;      In this dark and awful forest--wherefore dost thou not reply?      Here with monstrous jaws wide yawning--with his fierce and horrid form,      Gapes the forest king to slay me--and thou art not here to save.      None but I, thou'st said, for ever--none but I to thee am dear!      Make this oft-repeated language--make this oft-sworn promise true.      To thy queen bereft of reason--to thy weeping wife beloved,      Why repliest thou not--her only thou desir'st--she only thee.      Meagre, miserable, pallid--tainted with the dust and mire,      Scantly clad in half a garment--lone, with no protector near;      Like a large-eyed hind that wanders--separate from the wonted herd,      Thou regard'st me not, thus weeping--oh thou tamer of thy foes.      Mighty king, a lonely wanderer--in this vast and trackless wood,      Damayanti, I address thee--wherefore answerest not my voice?      Nobly born, and nobly minded--beautiful in every limb,      Do I not e'en now behold thee--in this mountain, first of men,      In this lion-haunted forest--in this tiger-howling wood,      Lying down or seated, standing--or in majesty and might      Moving, do I not behold thee--the enhancer of my woe?      Who shall I address, afflicted--wasted by my grief away;      'Hast thou haply seen my Nala--in the solitary wood?'      Who this day will show the monarch--wandering in the forest depth,      Beautiful and royal-minded--conqueror of an host of foes!      'Him thou seek'st with eyes of lotus--Nala, sovereign of men--      Lo, he's here!' whose voice of music--may I hear thus sweetly speak?      Lo, with fourfold tusks before me--and with wide and gaping jaws,      Stands the forest king, the tiger--I approach him without fear.      Of the beasts art thou the monarch--all this forest thy domain,      For the daughter of Vidarbha--Damayanti, know thou me,      Consort of Nishadha's sovereign--Nala, slayer of his foes--      Seeking here my exile husband--lonely, wretched, sorrow-driven,      Thou, O king of beasts, console me--if my Nala thou hast seen;      Or, O lord of all the forest--Nala if thou canst not show,      Best of savage beasts, devour me--from my misery set me free.
