Sec. II. <ON VARIATION IN A STATE OF NATURE AND ON THE NATURAL MEANS OF  SELECTION.>    Let us see how far above principles of variation apply to wild animals.  Wild animals vary exceedingly little--yet they are known as  individuals{47}. British Plants, in many genera number quite uncertain  of varieties and species: in shells chiefly external conditions{48}.  Primrose and cowslip. Wild animals from different [countries can be  recognized]. Specific character gives some organs as varying. Variations  analogous in kind, but less in degree with domesticated animals--chiefly  external and less important parts.         {47} i.e. they are individually distinguishable.         {48} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 133, vi. p. 165.    Our experience would lead us to expect that any and every one of these  organisms would vary if <the organism were> taken away <?> and placed  under new conditions. Geology proclaims a constant round of change,  bringing into play, by every possible <?> change of climate and the death  of pre-existing inhabitants, endless variations of new conditions. These  <?> generally very slow, doubtful though <illegible> how far the  slowness <?> would produce tendency to vary. But Geolog<ists> show  change in configuration which, together with the accidents of air and  water and the means of transportal which every being possesses, must  occasionally bring, rather suddenly, organism to new conditions and <?>  expose it for several generations. Hence <?> we should expect every now  and then a wild form to vary{49}; possibly this may be cause of some  species varying more than others.         {49} When the author wrote this sketch he seems not to have been so       fully convinced of the general occurrence of variation in nature as       he afterwards became. The above passage in the text possibly       suggests that at this time he laid more stress on _sports_ or       _mutations_ than was afterwards the case.    According to nature of new conditions, so we might expect all or  majority of organisms born under them to vary in some definite way.  Further we might expect that the mould in which they are cast would  likewise vary in some small degree. But is there any means of selecting  those offspring which vary in the same manner, crossing them and keeping  their offspring separate and thus producing selected races: otherwise as  the wild animals freely cross, so must such small heterogeneous  varieties be constantly counter-balanced and lost, and a uniformity of  character [kept up] preserved. The former variation as the direct and  necessary effects of causes, which we can see can act on them, as size  of body from amount of food, effect of certain kinds of food on certain  parts of bodies &c. &c.; such new varieties may then become adapted to  those external [natural] agencies which act on them. But can varieties  be produced adapted to end, which cannot possibly influence their  structure and which it is absurd to look <at> as effects of chance. Can  varieties like some vars of domesticated animals, like almost all wild  species be produced adapted by exquisite means to prey on one animal or  to escape from another,--or rather, as it puts out of question effects  of intelligence and habits, can a plant become adapted to animals, as a  plant which cannot be impregnated without agency of insect; or hooked  seeds depending on animal's existence: woolly animals cannot have any  direct effect on seeds of plant. This point which all theories about  climate adapting woodpecker{50} to crawl <?> up trees, <illegible>  miseltoe, <sentence incomplete>. But if every part of a plant or animal  was to vary <illegible>, and if a being infinitely more sagacious than  man (not an omniscient creator) during thousands and thousands of years  were to select all the variations which tended towards certain ends ([or  were to produce causes <?> which tended to the same end]), for instance,  if he foresaw a canine animal would be better off, owing to the country  producing more hares, if he were longer legged and keener  sight,--greyhound produced{51}. If he saw that aquatic <animal would  need> skinned toes. If for some unknown cause he found it would  advantage a plant, which <?> like most plants is occasionally visited by  bees &c.: if that plant's seed were occasionally eaten by birds and were  then carried on to rotten trees, he might select trees with fruit more  agreeable to such birds as perched, to ensure their being carried to  trees; if he perceived those birds more often dropped the seeds, he  might well have selected a bird who would <illegible> rotten trees or  [gradually select plants which <he> had proved to live on less and less  rotten trees]. Who, seeing how plants vary in garden, what blind foolish  man has done{52} in a few years, will deny an all-seeing being in  thousands of years could effect (if the Creator chose to do so), either  by his own direct foresight or by intermediate means,--which will  represent <?> the creator of this universe. Seems usual means. Be it  remembered I have nothing to say about life and mind and _all_ forms  descending from one common type{53}. I speak of the variation of the  existing great divisions of the organised kingdom, how far I would go,  hereafter to be seen.         {50} The author may possibly have taken the case of the woodpecker       from Buffon, _Histoire Nat. des Oiseaux_, T. vii. p. 3, 1780, where       however it is treated from a different point of view. He uses it       more than once, see for instance _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 3, 60, 184,       vi. pp. 3, 76, 220. The passage in the text corresponds with a       discussion on the woodpecker and the mistletoe in _Origin_, Ed. i.       p. 3, vi. p. 3.         {51} This illustration occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 90, 91,       vi. pp. 110, 111.         {52} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 83, vi. p. 102, where the word       _Creator_ is replaced by _Nature_.         {53} Note in the original. \"Good place to introduce, saying reasons       hereafter to be given, how far I extend theory, say to all       mammalia--reasons growing weaker and weaker.\"    Before considering whether <there> be any natural means of selection, and  secondly (which forms the 2nd Part of this sketch) the far more  important point whether the characters and relations of animated  <things> are such as favour the idea of wild species being races <?>  descended from a common stock, as the varieties of potato or dahlia or  cattle having so descended, let us consider probable character of  [selected races] wild varieties.    _Natural Selection._ De Candolle's war of nature,--seeing contented face  of nature,--may be well at first doubted; we see it on borders of  perpetual cold{54}. But considering the enormous geometrical power of  increase in every organism and as <?> every country, in ordinary cases  <countries> must be stocked to full extent, reflection will show that  this is the case. Malthus on man,--in animals no moral [check] restraint  <?>--they breed in time of year when provision most abundant, or season  most favourable, every country has its seasons,--calculate  robins,--oscillating from years of destruction{55}. If proof were wanted  let any singular change of climate <occur> here <?>, how astoundingly  some tribes <?> increase, also introduced animals{56}, the pressure is  always ready,--capacity of alpine plants to endure other  climates,--think of endless seeds scattered abroad,--forests regaining  their percentage{57},--a thousand wedges{58} are being forced into the  oeconomy of nature. This requires much reflection; study Malthus and  calculate rates of increase and remember the resistance,--only  periodical.         {54} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 62, 63, vi. p. 77, where similar       reference is made to De Candolle; for Malthus see _Origin_, p. 5.         {55} This may possibly refer to the amount of destruction going on.       See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 68, vi. p. 84, where there is an estimate       of a later date as to death-rate of birds in winter. \"Calculate       robins\" probably refers to a calculation of the rate of increase of       birds under favourable conditions.         {56} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 64, 65, vi. p. 80, he instances       cattle and horses and certain plants in S. America and American       species of plants in India, and further on, as unexpected effects       of changed conditions, the enclosure of a heath, and the relation       between the fertilisation of clover and the presence of cats       (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 74, vi. p. 91).         {57} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 74, vi. p. 91. \"It has been observed that       the trees now growing on ... ancient Indian mounds ... display the       same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the       surrounding virgin forests.\"         {58} The simile of the wedge occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 67;       it is deleted in Darwin's copy of the first edition: it does not       occur in Ed. vi.    The unavoidable effect of this <is> that many of every species are  destroyed either in egg or [young or mature (the former state the more  common)]. In the course of a thousand generations infinitesimally small  differences must inevitably tell{59}; when unusually cold winter, or hot  or dry summer comes, then out of the whole body of individuals of any  species, if there be the smallest differences in their structure,  habits, instincts [senses], health &c, <it> will on an average tell; as  conditions change a rather larger proportion will be preserved: so if  the chief check to increase falls on seeds or eggs, so will, in the  course of 1000 generations or ten thousand, those seeds (like one with  down to fly{60}) which fly furthest and get scattered most ultimately  rear most plants, and such small differences tend to be hereditary like  shades"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#6)"],[1,"home,  with the motor throttled down to test it at low speed, when he heard  some one shout.  Looking toward the bank, Tom saw a man waving his  hands.    \"I wonder what he wants?\" thought our hero as he put the wheel over to  send his craft to shore.  He heard a moment later, for the man on the  bank cried:    \"I say, my young friend, do you know anything about automobiles?  Of  course you do or you wouldn't be running a motor-boat.  Bless my very  existence, but I'm in trouble!  My machine has stopped on a lonely road  and I can't seem to get it started.  I happened to hear your boat and I  came here to hail you.  Bless my coat-pockets but I am in trouble!  Can  you help me?  Bless my soul and gizzard!\"    \"Mr. Damon!\" exclaimed Tom, shutting off the power, for he was now near  shore.  \"Of course I'll help you, Mr. Damon,\" for the young inventor  had recognized the eccentric man of whom he had purchased the  motor-cycle and who had helped him in rounding up the thieves.    \"Why, bless my shoe-laces, if it isn't Tom Swift!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon,  who seemed very fond of calling down blessings upon himself or upon  articles of his dress or person.    \"Yes! I'm here,\" admitted Tom with a laugh.    \"And in a motor-boat, too! Bless my pocketbook, but did that run away  with some one who sold it to you cheap?\"    \"No, not exactly,\" and the lad explained how he had come into  possession of it.  By this time he was ashore and had tied the ARROW to  an overhanging tree.  Then Tom proceeded to where Mr. Damon had left  his stalled automobile.  The eccentric man was wealthy and his  physician had instructed him to ride about in the car for his health.  Tom soon located the trouble.  The carburetor had become clogged, and  it was soon in working order again.    \"Well, now that you have a boat, I don't suppose you will be riding  about the country so much,\" commented Mr. Damon as he got into his car.  \"Bless my spark-plug! But if you ever get over to Waterfield, where I  live, come and see me.  It's handy to get to by water.\"    \"I'll come some day,\" promised the lad.    \"Bless my hat band, but I hope so,\" went on the eccentric individual as  he prepared to start his car.    Tom completed the remainder of the trip to his house without incident  and his father came down to the dock to see the motor-boat.  He agreed  with his son that it was a bargain and that it could easily be put in  fine shape.    The youth spent all the next day and part of the following working on  the craft.  He overhauled the ignition system, which was the jump-spark  style, cleaned the magneto and adjusted the gasoline and compression  taps so that they fitted better.  Then he readjusted the rudder lines,  tightening them on the steering wheel, and looked over the piping from  the gasoline tank.    The tank was in the forward compartment, and, upon inspecting this, the  lad concluded to change the plan by which the big galvanized iron box  was held in place.  He took out the old wooden braces and set them  closer together, putting in a few new ones.    \"The tank will not vibrate so when I'm going at full speed,\" he  explained to his father.    \"Is that where the strange man was tampering with the lock the day of  the auction?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"Yes, but I don't see what he could want in this compartment, do you  dad?\"    The inventor got into the boat and looked carefully into the rather  dark space where the tank fitted.  He went over every inch of it, and,  pointing to one of the thick wooden blocks that supported the tank,  asked:    \"Did you bore that hole in there, Tom?\"    \"No, it was there before I touched the braces.  But it isn't a hole, or  rather, someone bored it and stopped it up again.  It doesn't weaken  the brace any.\"    \"No, I suppose not.  I was just wondering whether that was one of the  new blocks or an old one.\"    \"Oh, an old one.  I'm going to paint them, too, so in case the water  leaks in or the gasoline leaks out the wood won't be affected.  A  gasoline tank should vibrate as little as possible, if you don't want  it to leak.  I guess I'll paint the whole interior of this compartment  white, then I can see away into the far corners of it.\"    \"I think that's a good idea,\" commented Mr. Swift.    It was four days after his purchase of the boat before Tom was ready to  make a long trip in it.  Up to that time he had gone on short spins not  far from the dock, in order to test the engine adjustment.  The lad  found it was working very well, but he decided with a new kind of spark  plugs for the two cylinders that he could get more speed out of it.  Finally the forward compartment was painted and a general overhauling  given the hull and Tom was ready to put his boat to a good test.    \"Come on, Ned,\" he said to his chum early one evening after Mr. Swift  had said he was too tired to go out on a trial run.  \"We'll see what  the ARROW will do now.\"    From the time Tom started up the motor it was evident that the boat was  going through the water at a rapid rate.  For a mile or more the two  lads speeded along, enjoying it hugely.  Then Ned exclaimed:    \"Something's coming behind us.\"    Tom turned his head and looked.  Then he called out:    \"It's Mr. Hastings in his new CARLOPA.  I wonder if he wants a race?\"    \"Guess he'd have it all his own way,\" suggested Ned.    \"Oh, I don't know.  I can get a little more speed out of my boat.\"    Tom waited until the former owner of the ARROW was up to him.    \"Want a race?\" asked Mr. Hastings good-naturedly.    \"Sure!\" agreed Tom, and he shoved the timer ahead to produce quicker  explosions.    The ARROW seemed to leap forward and for a moment was ahead of the  CARLOPA, but with a motion of his hand to the spark lever Mr. Hastings  also increased his speed.  For a moment the two boats were on even  terms and then the larger and newer one forged ahead.  Tom had expected  it, but he was a little disappointed.    \"That's doing first rate,\" complimented Mr. Hastings as he passed them.  \"Better than I was ever able to make her do even when she was new, Tom.\"    This made the present owner of the ARROW feel somewhat consoled.  He  and Ned ran on for a few miles, the CARLOPA in the meanwhile  disappearing from view around a bend.  Then Tom and his chum turned  around and made for the Swift dock.    \"She certainly is a dandy!\" declared Ned.  \"I wish I had one like it.\"    \"Oh, I intend that you shall have plenty of rides in this,\" went on his  friend.  \"When you get your vacation, you and dad and I are going on a  tour,\" and he explained his plan, which, it is needless to say, met  with Ned's hearty approval.    Just before going to bed, some hours later, Tom decided to go down to  the dock to make sure he had shut off the gasoline cock leading from  the tank of his boat to the motor.  It was a calm, early summer night,  with a new moon giving a little light, and the lad went down to the  lake in his slippers.  As he neared the boathouse he heard a noise.    \"Water rat,\" he murmured, \"or maybe muskrats.  I must set some traps.\"    As Tom entered the boathouse he started back in alarm, for a bright  light flashed up, almost in his eyes.    \"Who's here?\" he cried, and at that moment someone sprang out of his  motor-boat, scrambled into a rowing craft which the youth could dimly  make out in front of the dock and began to pull away quickly.    \"Hold on there!\" cried the young inventor. \"Who are you?  What do you  want?  Come back here!\"    The person in the 'coat returned no answer.  With his heart doing beats  over-time Tom lighted a lantern and made a hasty examination of the  ARROW.  It did not appear to have been harmed, but a glance showed that  the door of the gasoline compartment had been unlocked and was open.  Tom jumped down into his craft.    \"Some one has been at that compartment again!\" he murmured.  \"I wonder  if it was the same man who acted so suspiciously at the auction?  What  can his object be, anyhow?\"    The next moment he uttered an exclamation of startled surprise and  picked up something from the bottom of the boat.  It was a bunch of  keys, with a tag attached, bearing the owner's name.    \"Andy Foger!\" murmured Tom.  \"So this is, how he was trying to get  even!  Maybe he started to put a hole in the tank or in my boat.\"          CHAPTER VI    TOWING SOME GIRLS      With a sense of anger mingled with an apprehension lest some harm  should have been done to his craft, the owner of the ARROW went  carefully over it.  He could find nothing wrong.  The engine was all  right and all that appeared to have been accomplished by the unbidden  visitor was the opening of the locked forward compartment.  That this  had been done by one of the many keys on Andy Foger's ring was evident.    \"Now what could have been his object?\" mused Tom.  \"I should think if  he wanted to put a hole in the boat he would have done it amidships,  where the water would have a better chance to come in, or perhaps he  wanted to flood it with gasoline and--\"    The idea of fire was in Tom's mind, and he did not finish his  half-completed thought.    \"That may have been it,\" he resumed after a hasty examination of the  gasoline tank, to make sure there were no leaks in it.  \"To get even  with me for outbidding him on the boat, Andy may have wanted to destroy  the ARROW.  Well, of all the mean tricks, that's about the limit!  But  wait until I see him.  I've got evidence against him,\" and Tom looked  at the key ring.  \"I could almost have him arrested for this.\"    Going outside the boathouse, Tom stood on the edge of the dock and  peered into the darkness.  He could hear the faint sound of someone  rowing across the lake, but there was no light.    \"He had one of those electric flash lanterns,\" decided Tom.  \"If I  hadn't found his keys, I might have thought it was Happy Harry instead  of Andy.\"    The young inventor went back into the house after carefully locking the  boat compartment and detaching"]]]
