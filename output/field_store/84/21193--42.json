[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#6)"],[1,"the little book  must have been continually moved from pillar to post. Besides, it is  unlikely that copies for kitchen use would be strongly bound in morocco.  The very printing and paper of the book sufficiently indicate the use to  which its producers at least expected it to be put. So the little 'French  pastrycook' gradually disappeared. Those for whose benefit it had been  written would soon learn its secrets by heart and confide them verbally  to their apprentices; and it would not be long ere the tattered and  greasy booklet found its way into the dustbin.    Of all the _rarae aves_ sought by book-collectors this little volume is  perhaps the most widely known. That copies may still exist in this  country is shown to be possible by the fact (recorded by Willems) that  one was sold at an auction in Belfast. Another was found at Brighton, and  occasionally one appears in the London salerooms, as we have shown. It  requires little imagination to picture merchants and travellers, whose  paths led through the Low Countries at that time, slipping copies into  their pockets or holsters for use in the household across the water. Many  a courtly exile during the Protectorate, glancing through the bookshops  of Amsterdam, must have chanced upon the little volume as a gift for wife  or daughter.    Numbers, also, must have found their way to France. Some years ago our  book-hunter happened to stay at an ancient hostel in Rouen. From the  outside the building was everything that could possibly be desired by  bibliophile or antiquary. It was situated in one of those quaint narrow  back streets that lead towards the Place Henri Quatre; and the courtyard  was so small as scarcely to allow a baker's cart to turn round in it.  Like many of the houses in this ancient town, its crookedness was such  that it seemed impossible for it to remain standing much longer.  Misgivings arose within him as he ascended the staircase, which seemed to  sway as he avoided the broken treads. But the sight of the bedroom he was  to occupy, furnished with such furniture and such a bed, all spotlessly  clean and polished, sent him into the seventh heaven of delight. Here he  could read and write undisturbed for as long as he chose to stay. Surely  pleasant surprises must be in store for one in every way in such  surroundings as these!    It was not long before he got one.    'Will Monsieur require anything to be cooked for him to-night?' inquired  the trim hostess.    It was rather late and our bookman was disinclined to seek a restaurant.  Besides, he was anxious to explore his lodging before it got too dark. An  omelette would be delicious, provided she could make one properly.    'Eggs, perhaps, and tea, with bread and butter'--could she turn the eggs  into an omelette?    'Why certainly,' with a merry laugh, 'of course--_I can prepare eggs in  more than sixty ways._'    To say that our book-hunter started would be to put it mildly. A certain  title-page instantly rose before his eyes. There was only one way in  which anybody could possibly learn to cook eggs in sixty different ways,  and that was by studying the 'Pastissier Francois.' Without the slightest  doubt the hostess possessed a copy, and he was at last to look upon the  tiny volume that he had sought for so long. But as she seemed so proud of  her achievement, could she be induced to part with the precious tome?  These and many other kindred thoughts passed rapidly through his mind as  he repeated slowly 'en plus de soixante facons?'    She laughed again. Ah yes, but she couldn't repeat them _d'abord_, she  would have to _refer to her book_.    He had difficulty in controlling his voice sufficiently to inquire what  her book was.    Oh, it was just a little book which her mother had given her, a little  book of _la cuisine_. Could he see it? Why certainly, but it could not  possibly interest monsieur, it was only a common little book, and dirty.    Ah, as usual it would be soiled, perhaps badly, for it was evidently  still in constant use; but so long as it were complete one might possibly  be able to clean it. What delightful thoughts and anticipations passed  through his mind as the hostess slowly descended the rickety stairs to  fetch her treasure! At last he had found it, and just in the very sort of  house and town where he had always expected to come across it. Well,  well, if you make up your mind to have a thing and search eagerly enough  for it, you are bound to obtain it in the long run.    Then another thought entered his mind: how much should he offer her for  it? Probably she would not part with it unless he named a sum which she  could not resist; yet if the sum were at all large she might suspect the  book's value and refuse. Ten francs, twenty-five, a hundred? While he was  deliberating this important point she was ascending the stairs. Should he  turn his back to her, shut his eyes, and tell her to place the volume on  the middle of the table, then suddenly turn about and gloat upon the  little treasure?    Before he could make up his mind she came in and he got his second  surprise that day. It was not as pleasant as the first, for in her hands  she held a thick octavo volume bound in shiny black leather. Heavens!  . . . a large-paper copy? . . . No, no, impossible. . . .    'Le voici, m'sieu.'    Our poor book-hunter's feelings almost overcame him, and he opened the  dirty manuscript volume mechanically, feebly muttering 'tres  interessant.' She watched him closely, and from that moment considered  him slightly mad. However, the book certainly did contain sixty-two  recipes for cooking eggs as well as receipts for making fancy pastry and  cakes. Whether it was copied out of the 'Pastissier' I know not; but  certain it is that the hostess had no knowledge of, nor had ever seen,  that volume.    There must be many book-treasures lying hid in all these ancient towns of  Northern France, towns also that lie far off the restless tourist's  track, small country towns in which the majority of the houses are  slipshod timbered relics of a bygone age. No striking or unusual feature  can they offer to the curious, and so for the most part they are  dismissed in brief by the guide book. Yet there is many an aged building  in Brittany where old books do still lie hid, as our bookman knows from  the library of a friend who lives in Finisterre. St. Brieuc, Guingamp,  Morlaix, Quimper, even Brest, all these must harbour long-forgotten  books.    But there are other towns which no power on earth shall force our  book-hunter to disclose. One there is far off the beaten track, where the  houses, painted with bright colours, lean all askew, supporting each  other and sometimes almost toppling across the narrow winding streets. So  that, entering it, one seems to have stepped suddenly into some such  fairy town as exists in the pages of Grimm or Hans Andersen; and, half  ashamed, one peers curiously at the dwellers in this goblin town, as  though expecting to find that they have pointed ears and narrow elfin  feet. They never seem to move about, and, sitting at almost every  doorstep, watch one intently from weird nooks and crannies. Hurry and  bustle are here unknown, and though they will reply to you in the best of  French, yet to each other the townsfolk speak a strange and uncouth  tongue.    Once, rambling in the narrow alleys about the ancient church, our  book-hunter ventured through a gothic doorway along a broad passage that  was guarded by a huge and ancient iron grille and presently he found  himself in a small courtyard paved with moss-grown cobbles. About it was  a timbered gallery, roofed, once doubtless level, now gently and  gracefully undulating so that it seemed about to fall from off the wall  to which it was attached. But the walls had also subsided with the  gallery, so that the whole still showed a symmetry that was pleasing to  the eye. Above the gallery and across the front of the building had been  painted the legend HOTEL DU LION D'OR, and a dim weatherbeaten shield  above the doorway still bore the trace of a rampant lion. It seemed a  large building, judging by the number of its windows, far larger than its  present-day custom could possibly warrant.    The place was curiously still, for the noise of carts and footsteps could  never penetrate into that silent court, and it must have been many years  since chaise or horseman clattered across its now mossy _pave_. The  stillness was almost uncanny, forbidding, and our book-hunter hesitated  to cross the courtyard lest the sound of his footsteps should disturb the  slumber of the ancient building. Presently a rat squealed somewhere along  the gallery, and a voice called out sharply within. The spell was broken,  and entering the house he called for a 'petit verre' preparatory to  finding out something of the inn's history.    Yes, it was very old, and madame had been born in it; but now that she  was left alone with Jeanne it was very lonely, and there was little  custom. Did they have many travellers there? Oh no, not for a long time,  the house was not easy to find, and as the old customers died none came  to fill their places. But sometimes Messieurs So and So came in of an  evening and took a 'petit verre,' and then the neighbours were very  friendly, so it was not so bad.    So the hostess prattled on, only too pleased to impart the news of her  little world to a newcomer from the greater one, while all the time  fantastic visions rose before him. He pictured old hide-bound trunks  that had been left behind by travellers who had never returned, trunks  which, opened, would prove to contain priceless black-letter books:  boxes, stored in attics and cellars and in concealed presses, which would  contain ancient apparel with copies of the 'Pastissier' in the pockets:  small travelling bags, tendered by needy scholars in lieu of payment,  which he would find stuffed with rare Elzeviers: rusty iron-b"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22718"],[0,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"of the  austere Romanesque, and Saint-Etienne of Agde is a gratifying type of  the Maritime Church of the Midi.    [Illustration: \"CORRESPONDING DIFFERENCES IN STYLE.\"--CARCASSONNE.]    This Cathedral of the Sea is a fitting example of a peculiar type of  architecture which exists also in Provence,--a succession of  fortress-churches that extend along the Mediterranean from Spain to  Italy like the peaks of a mountain chain. Nothing can better illustrate  the continuous warrings and raidings in the South of France than these  strange churches, and their many fortified counterparts inland, in both  Languedoc and Gascony. Castles and walled towns were not sufficient to  protect the Southerner from invasions and incursions; his churches and  Cathedrals, even to the XIV century, were strongholds, more suitable for  men-at-arms than for priests, and seemingly dedicated to some war-god  rather than to the gentle Virgin Mother and the Martyr-Saints under  whose protection they nominally dwelt.    Although most interesting, the military church of the interior is seldom  the Bishop's church. The maritime church on the contrary is nearly  always a Cathedral, with strangely curious legends and episodes. The  French coast of the Mediterranean was the scene of continuous pillage.  Huns, Normans, Moors, Saracens, unknown pirates and free-booters of all  nationalities found it very lucrative and convenient to descend on a  sea-board town, and escape as they had come, easily, their boats loaded  with booty. \"As late as the XII century,\" writes Barr Ferree,  \"buccaneers gained a livelihood by preying on the peaceful and  unoffending inhabitants of the villages and cities. The Cathedrals, as  the most important buildings and the most conspicuous, were strongly  fortified, both to protect their contents and to serve as strongholds  for the citizens in case of need. In these churches, therefore,  architecture assumed its most utilitarian form and buildings are real  fortifications, with battlemented walls, strong and heavy towers, and  small windows, and are provided with the other devices of Romanesque  architecture of a purely military type.\"    [Illustration: \"FORTIFIED GOTHIC BUILT IN BRICK.\"--ALBI.]    \"Time has dealt hardly with them. The kingly power, being entrenched in  Paris, developed from the Isle de France. The wealth that once enriched  the fertile lands of the South moved northwards, and the great  commercial cities of the North became the most important centres of  activity. Then the southern towns began to decline,\" and the  buildings which remain to represent most perfectly the \"Church-Fortress\"  are not those of Provence, which are \"patched\" and \"restored,\" but those  of Languedoc, Agde, and Maguelonne, and Elne of the near-by country of  Rousillon.    [Illustration: \"A CHURCH FORTRESS.\"--MAGUELONNE.]      [Sidenote: Gascony.]    Gascony, the last of the southern provinces and the farthest from Rome,  had great prosperity under Imperial dominion. Many patricians emigrated  there, roads were built, commerce flourished, and as in Provence and  Languedoc, towns grew into large and well-established cities.  Christianity made a comparatively early conquest of the province; and  at the beginning of the IV century, eleven suffragan Bishoprics had been  established under the Archbishopric of Eauze. Gascony has many old  Cathedral cities, and has had many ancient Cathedrals; but after the  fall of the Roman Empire in the V century, a series of wars began which  destroyed not only the Christian architecture, but almost every trace of  Roman wealth and culture. Little towers remain, supposed shrines of  Mercury, protector of commerce and travel; pieces of statues are found;  but the Temples, the Amphitheatres, the Forums, have disappeared, and  even more completely, the rude Christian churches of that early period.    Although the province has no Mediterranean coast and could not be  molested by the marauders of that busy sea, it lay directly upon the  route of armies between France and Spain; and it is no \"gasconading\" to  say that it was for centuries one of the greatest battle-fields of the  South. Vandals, Visigoths, Franks, Saracens, Normans,--Gascons against  Carlovingians, North against South, all had burned, raided, and  destroyed Gascony before the XI century. It is not surprising, then,  that there are found fewer traces of antiquity here than in Provence and  Languedoc. Even the few names of decimated cities which survived,  designated towns on new sites. Eauze, formerly on the Gelise, lay long  in ruins, and was finally re-built a kilometre inland. Lectoure and Auch  had long since retired from the river Gers and taken refuge on the hills  of their present situations, while other cities fell into complete ruin  and forgetfulness.    [Illustration: STATELY GOTHIC SPLENDOUR.--CONDOM.]    The year 1000, which followed these events, was that of the predicted  and expected end of the world. The extravagances of Christians at that  time are well known, the gifts of all property that were made to the  Church, the abandonment of worldly pursuits, the terrors of many, the  anxiety of the calmest, the emotional excesses which led people to live  in trees that they might be near to heaven when the \"great trump\" should  sound,--\"Mundi fine appropinquante.\" But the trumpet did not sound, and  Raoul Glaber, a monk of the XI century, writes that all over Italy and  the Gaul of his day there was great haste to restore and re-build  churches, a general rivalry between towns and between countries, as to  which could build most remarkably. \"This activity,\" says Quicherat, \"may  show a desire to renew alliance with the Creator.\" It certainly proves  that the generation of the year 1000 had fresh and new architectural  ideas.    This was the period of recuperation and re-building for Gascony. The  monks of the VIII, IX, and X centuries had devoted themselves with zeal  and success to the cultivation of the soil. They had acquired fertile  fields, and desiring peace, they had placed themselves in positions  where their strength would defend them when their holy calling was not  respected. These monasteries were places of refuge and soon gave their  name and their protection to the towns and villages which began to  cluster about them. Except the declining settlements of Roman days,  Gascony had few towns in the X century; and many of her most important  cities of to-day owe their foundation, their existence, and their  prosperity to these Benedictine monasteries. Eauze regained its life  after the establishment of a convent, and in the XI, XII, and XIII  centuries, the Abbots of Citeaux, Bishops, and even lords of the laity,  occupied themselves in the creation of new cities. Many of the towns of  mediaeval creation possessed broad municipal and commercial privileges,  they grew to the importance of \"communes\" and Bishoprics, and some even  styled themselves \"Republics.\"    Although these were times of much re-building, restoring, and carrying  out of older plans of ecclesiastical architecture, the XI and XII  centuries were none the less filled with innumerable private wars, and  in 1167 began the bloody and persistent struggle with England. The city  of Aire was at one time reduced to twelve inhabitants, and the horrors  of the mediaeval siege were more than once repeated. In these wars,  Cathedrals, as well as towns and their inhabitants, were scarred and  wounded. Hardly had these dissensions ended in 1494, when the Wars of  Religion commenced under Charles IX, and Gascony was again one of the  most terrible fields of battle. Here the demoniac enthusiasm of both  sides exceeded even the terrible exhibitions of Languedoc. The royal  family of Navarre was openly Protestant and contributed more than any  others to the military organisations of their Faith. Jeanne d'Albret, in  1566, wishing to repay intolerance with intolerance, forbade religious  processions and church funerals in Navarre. The people rose, and the  next year the Queen was forced to grant toleration to both religions.  Later the King of France entered the field and sent an army against the  Bearnaise Huguenots, Jeanne, in reprisal, called to her aid Montmorency;  and with a thoroughness born of pious zeal and hatred, each army began  to burn and kill. All monasteries, all churches, were looted by the  Protestants; all cities taken by Montluc, head of the Catholics, were  sacked. Tarbes was devastated by the one, Rabestans by the other, and  the Cathedral of Pamiers was ruined. With the Massacre of Saint  Bartholomew, in 1572, the struggle began again, and the League  flourished in all its malign enthusiasm. \"Such disorder as was  introduced,\" says a writer of the period, \"such pillage, has never been  seen since war began. Officers, soldiers, followers, and volunteers were  so overburdened with booty as to be incommoded thereby. And after this  brigandage, the peasants hereabouts [Bigorre] abandoned their very farms  from lack of cattle, and the greater number went into Spain.\"    During long centuries of such religious and political devastation the  architectural energy of Gascony was expended in replacing churches which  had been destroyed, and were again to be destroyed or injured. It would  be unfair to expect of this province the great magnificence which its  brave, cheerful, and extravagant little people believe it \"once  possessed,\" or to look, amid such unrest, for the calm growth of any  architectural style. It is a country of few Cathedrals, of curious  churches built for war and prayer, and of such occasional outbursts of  magnificence as is seen in the Romanesque portal of Saint-Pierre of  Moissac and in the stately Gothic splendour of the Cathedrals at Condom  and at Bayonne. It is a country where Cathedrals are surrounded by the  most beautiful of landscapes, and where each has some legend or story of  the English, the League, of the Black"]]]
