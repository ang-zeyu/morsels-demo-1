That there are carnivorous animals which take heavy toll in every  generation of the progeny of the animals on which they prey, and that  there are herbivores which decimate the plants in every generation had  long been known, but it is only since Darwin's time that sufficient  attention has been paid to the facts that, in addition to this regular  destruction, there exists between the members of a species a keen  competition for space and food, which limits multiplication, and that  numerous individuals of each species perish because of unfavourable  climatic conditions. The \"struggle for existence,\" which Darwin  regarded as taking the place of the human breeder in free nature, is  not a direct struggle between carnivores and their prey, but is the  assumed competition for survival between individuals _of the same_  species, of which, on an average, only those survive to reproduce  which have the greatest power of resistance, while the others, less  favourably constituted, perish early. This struggle is so keen, that,  within a limited area, where the conditions of life have long remained  unchanged, of every species, whatever be the degree of fertility, only  two, _on an average_, of the descendants of each pair survive; the  others succumb either to enemies, or to disadvantages of climate, or  to accident. A high degree of fertility is thus not an indication of  the special success of a species, but of the numerous dangers that  have attended its evolution. Of the six young brought forth by a pair  of elephants in the course of their lives only two survive in a given  area; similarly, of the millions of eggs which two thread-worms leave  behind them only two survive. It is thus possible to estimate the  dangers which threaten a species by its ratio of elimination, or,  since this cannot be done directly, by its fertility.    Although a great number of the descendants of each generation fall  victims to accident, among those that remain it is still the greater  or less fitness of the organism that determines the \"selection for  breeding purposes,\" and it would be incomprehensible if, in this  competition, it were not ultimately, that is, on an average, the best  equipped which survive, in the sense of living long enough to  reproduce.    Thus the principle of natural selection is _the selection of the best  for reproduction_, whether the \"best\" refers to the whole  constitution, to one or more parts of the organism, or to one or more  stages of development. Every organ, every part, every character of an  animal, fertility and intelligence included, must be improved in this  manner, and be gradually brought up in the course of generations to  its highest attainable state of perfection. And not only may  improvement of parts be brought about in this way, but new parts and  organs may arise, since, through the slow and minute steps of  individual or \"fluctuating\" variations, a part may be added here or  dropped out there, and thus something new is produced.    The principle of selection solved the riddle as to how what was  purposive could conceivably be brought about without the intervention  of a directing power, the riddle which animate nature presents to our  intelligence at every turn, and in face of which the mind of a Kant  could find no way out, for he regarded a solution of it as not to be  hoped for. For, even if we were to assume an evolutionary force that  is continually transforming the most primitive and the simplest forms  of life into ever higher forms, and the homogeneity of primitive times  into the infinite variety of the present, we should still be unable to  infer from this alone how each of the numberless forms adapted to  particular conditions of life should have appeared _precisely at the  right moment in the history of the earth_ to which their adaptations  were appropriate, and precisely at the proper place in which all the  conditions of life to which they were adapted occurred: the  humming-birds at the same time as the flowers; the trichina at the  same time as the pig; the bark-coloured moth at the same time as the  oak, and the wasp-like moth at the same time as the wasp which  protects it. Without processes of selection we should be obliged to  assume a \"pre-established harmony\" after the famous Leibnitzian model,  by means of which the clock of the evolution of organisms is so  regulated as to strike in exact synchronism with that of the history  of the earth! All forms of life are strictly adapted to the conditions  of their life, and can persist under these conditions alone.    There must therefore be an intrinsic connection between the conditions  and the structural adaptations of the organism, and, _since the  conditions of life cannot be determined by the animal itself, the  adaptations must be called forth by the conditions_.    The selection theory teaches us how this is conceivable, since it  enables us to understand that there is a continual production of what  is non-purposive as well as of what is purposive, but the purposive  alone survives, while the non-purposive perishes in the very act of  arising. This is the old wisdom taught long ago by Empedocles.      II. THE LAMARCKIAN PRINCIPLE    Lamarck, as is well known, formulated a definite theory of evolution  at the beginning of the nineteenth century, exactly fifty years before  the Darwin-Wallace principle of selection was given to the world. This  brilliant investigator also endeavoured to support his theory by  demonstrating forces which might have brought about the  transformations of the organic world in the course of the ages. In  addition to other factors, he laid special emphasis on the increased  or diminished use of the parts of the body, assuming that the  strengthening or weakening which takes place from this cause during  the individual life, could be handed on to the offspring, and thus  intensified and raised to the rank of a specific character. Darwin  also regarded this _Lamarckian principle_, as it is now generally  called, as a factor in evolution, but he was not fully convinced of  the transmissibility of acquired characters.    As I have here to deal only with the theory of selection, I need not  discuss the Lamarckian hypothesis, but I must express my opinion that  there is room for much doubt as to the cooeperation of this principle  in evolution. Not only is it difficult to imagine how the transmission  of functional modifications could take place, but, up to the present  time, notwithstanding the endeavours of many excellent investigators,  not a single actual proof of such inheritance has been brought  forward. Semon's experiments on plants are, according to the botanist  Pfeffer, not to be relied on, and even the recent, beautiful  experiments made by Dr. Kammerer on salamanders, cannot, as I hope to  show elsewhere, be regarded as proof, if only because they do not deal  at all with functional modifications, that is, with modifications  brought about by use, and it is to these _alone_ that the Lamarckian  principle refers.      III. OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF SELECTION      (_a_) _Saltatory evolution_    The Darwinian doctrine of evolution depends essentially on _the  cumulative augmentation_ of minute variations in the direction of  utility. But can such minute variations, which are undoubtedly  continually appearing among the individuals of the same species,  possess any selection-value; can they determine which individuals are  to survive, and which are to succumb; can they be increased by natural  selection till they attain to the highest development of a purposive  variation?    To many this seems so improbable that they have urged a theory of  evolution by leaps from species to species. Koelliker, in 1872,  compared the evolution of species with the processes which we can  observe in the individual life in cases of alternation of generations.  But a polyp only gives rise to a medusa because it has itself arisen  from one, and there can be no question of a medusa ever having arisen  suddenly and _de novo_ from a polyp-bud, if only because both forms  are adapted in their structure as a whole, and in every detail to the  conditions of their life. A sudden origin, in a natural way, of  numerous adaptations is inconceivable. Even the degeneration of a  medusoid from a free-swimming animal to a mere brood-sac (gonophore)  is not sudden and saltatory, but occurs by imperceptible modifications  throughout hundreds of years, as we can learn from the numerous stages  of the process of degeneration persisting at the same time in  different species.    If, then, the degeneration to a simple brood-sac takes place only by  very slow transitions, each stage of which may last for centuries, how  could the much more complex _ascending_ evolution possibly have taken  place by sudden leaps? I regard this argument as capable of further  extension, for wherever in nature we come upon degeneration, it is  taking place by minute steps and with a slowness that makes it not  directly perceptible, and I believe that this in itself justifies us  in concluding that _the same must be true of ascending_ evolution. But  in the latter case the goal can seldom be distinctly recognised while  in cases of degeneration the starting-point of the process can often  be inferred, because several nearly related species may represent  different stages.    In recent years Bateson in particular has championed the idea of  saltatory, or so-called discontinuous evolution, and has collected a  number of cases in which more or less marked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#6)"],[1," sell, munitions since modern war began.  England sympathized with the South in our civil war, yet sold to the  North. She did the same in 1870 to France.    If the trade in munitions is to be forbidden, then every state must  accumulate its own supply or greatly enlarge its arms manufacturing  capacity, both wasteful processes. To say that a moderate trade is  lawful which a big trade is not is like the excuse of the lady who  thought her baby born out of wedlock did not matter because it was  such a little one.    The critics of the munitions trade must note furthermore that in our  own country that trade cannot be forbidden without explicit  legislation.    At the outset of the Spanish war such legislation was passed, as a war  measure, forbidding the export of coal or other war material at the  discretion of the President. But by resolution of Congress of March  14, 1912, the 1898 resolution was so amended as to apply to American  countries only. The reason for this distinction was, of course, to  limit the danger of such exports of arms to our neighbor states,  particularly to Mexico, as might endanger our own peace and safety.  The general right to trade was left undisturbed.    But let us argue the question on ethical grounds alone. I can see no  difference between a peace trade and a war trade from the humanitarian  standpoint; between arming a neighbor by our exports in preparation  for war and rearming him during war. In both cases we help him to  kill. Now, if one regards all war as wrong, aid in waging war by trade  in munitions, whether in peace time or war time, should be abhorrent  to one's conscience. A Quaker gun is not only a paradox, but a sinful  one.    Most of us, however, believe that a defensive war, against aggression  threatening the life and liberties of a nation, is just and right. In  the present war both parties claim to be fighting in self-defense. We  are not their judge; we must take both at their word; what we owe  both, ethically, is simply equality of treatment.    We help both alike in waging a just war. To do otherwise is to take  part in their war. With the flux and flow of the contest which makes  our trade valuable or worthless now to one side, now to the other,  both ethically and legally we have nothing to do.          Armenian, Orduna, and Others      _The diplomatic significance of the sinking of the Leyland liner  Armenian on June 28 off the northwest coast of Cornwall is thus dwelt  upon in a Washington dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _dated July 2,  1915:_    The lessons to be derived from the destruction of the Leyland liner  Armenian off the English coast are expected to have a most important  bearing upon the diplomatic controversy between Germany and the United  States over the safety of human life in the submarine warfare.    It is believed here that the Armenian affair demonstrates that it is  possible for German submarines of the latest types, when equipped with  outside rapid-fire guns, to comply with the demand of President Wilson  that the belligerent right of visit and search must be complied with  before merchantmen and passenger ships are torpedoed.    Whatever the facts as to minor detail, the outstanding lesson of the  affair is that a merchantman tried to escape capture and was finally  forced to halt and surrender by a pursuing submarine, and the  destruction of the liner by torpedo was not attempted until after  those on board who survived the chase had an opportunity to take to  the boats. It is evident that if the Armenian's Captain had heeded the  warning shots of the submarine and halted the steamer he could have  submitted to visit and search and in all probability the destruction  of the Armenian could have been effected without loss of life. All  international law experts agree that a vessel that refuses to halt  when challenged by warning shots from a properly commissioned  belligerent war vessel proceeds at her own peril.    In its broader aspects, the Armenian incident presents the most  important lesson that has come out of the German undersea campaign for  consideration by those engaged in the diplomatic controversy over the  various acts of the German submarines--and the lesson is considered  extremely vital in its bearing on the pending negotiations, because,  if it is at all possible for submarines to exercise the right of visit  and search and they actually proceed in accordance with that rule, the  Germans may proceed with their warfare against merchantmen carrying  contraband without running counter to the expectations of the United  States Government. Occasional merchantmen may try to escape capture or  destruction by disregarding warning shots, but that will be their  affair and the responsibility for loss of life due to efforts to elude  submarines, and caused during the period of continued efforts to  escape, would not then rest upon the submarines.    The effective use of rapid-fire guns mounted on submarines in bona  fide efforts to halt merchant steamers for purpose of visit and search  is the important factor in the situation. A submarine not so equipped  would find it difficult, if not impossible, to apply the rule of visit  and search. Without the outside guns such a submarine would possess no  other effective weapon than the torpedo. The submarine that carried no  exterior armament could not compel obedience to its mandate for the  merchant Captain to stop without firing a torpedo and thus risking the  destruction of life with the sinking of the steamer, and a submarine  with no outside armament might run the risk, as frequently contended  by the German Admiralty, of bomb attack from the rails of the merchant  steamer when going alongside of such a vessel.    [Illustration: GENERAL CARLO CANEVA    One of the Most Conspicuous of Italian Military Commanders    (_Photo from Central News._)]    [Illustration: H.I.M. FRANCIS JOSEPH I.    Latest Portrait of the Venerable Sovereign of the Austro-Hungarian  Empire    (_Photo from Bain._)]    A submarine like the U-38, which sank the Armenian, carrying one or  more outside guns, capable of discharging various kinds of shell, from  blank shots to shrapnel, represents an important evolution in the  development of marine warfare. Such a craft has the equipment to  enable her to visit and search a passing merchantman, and to provide  for the safe removal of officers, crew or passengers from a challenged  steamer, before the destruction of the vessel. It is only necessary  for such a submarine to fire her torpedoes as a last resort for the  destruction of the steamer. With her exterior guns a submarine like  the U-38, upon meeting a merchant vessel, may fire one or more warning  shots, as Captain Trickey of the Armenian says the U-38 did.[1] The  raider, he said, fired two warning shots, and when he turned away from  her and put on speed, the submarine's guns opened fire on him with  shrapnel.    [Footnote 1: Captain Trickey, describing the destruction of his  vessel, through which several Americans lost their lives, said on July  1 in Liverpool:    \"We sighted the submarine about 6.48 o'clock Monday night, June 28,  when we were about twenty miles west of Trevose Head, on the northwest  coast of Cornwall. We were then about four miles away. She drew  closer. She fired two shots across our bows. I then turned my stern to  her and ran for all I was worth. The submarine shelled us all the  time, killing several of the crew and cutting away several of our  boats. The boats had already been swung out, and some of the men had  taken up positions in them ready for the order to lower away. In some  cases the falls were cut by shrapnel, and several of the men fell into  the sea.    \"A stern chase ensued, lasting for about an hour, the German shelling  us unceasingly. My steering gear was cut and knocked out of order. One  shell came through the engine-room skylight, and another knocked the  Marconi house away. Still another shell went down the funnel,  disabling the stokehole and making it impossible to keep up a full  head of steam. Thirteen of my crew were lying dead on the deck, and  the ship was on fire in three places. Then I decided to surrender. It  was the only thing I could do. By this time the submarine had  decreased the distance between us to about a mile.    \"From the moment we surrendered the Germans acted fairly toward us and  gave us ample time to get out of the ship. They even rescued some of  the men--three, I think--who had previously fallen from the boats and  were still afloat aided by their lifebelts. When we had got away from  the ship the submarine fired two torpedoes into her and she sank at  8.07 o'clock. We remained in the boats all night and were picked up  the next morning by the Belgian steam trawler President Stevens.\"]      THE ANGLO-CALIFORNIAN    _Like the Armenian, the British merchantman Anglo-Californian refused  to lie-to when signaled by a German submarine on July 2. Her crew of  ninety-five included fifty Americans and Canadians. A Queenstown  dispatch of July 5 gave the following account of the action:_    The Anglo-Californian left Montreal for the British Isles on June 24.  The submarine was sighted at 8 o'clock last Sunday morning. Captain  Parslow ordered full steam ahead and wireless calls for aid were sent  out. The submarine on the surface proved to be a far speedier craft  than the steamer and rapidly overhauled her, meanwhile deluging her  with shells. One shot put the wireless apparatus on the  Anglo-Californian out of action. Finding that he could not escape by  running for it Captain Parslow devoted his attention to manoeuvring  his ship so as to prevent the submarine from using torpedoes  effectively.    \"Our Captain was a brave man,\" said one of the narrators. \"He kept at  his post on the bridge, coolly giving orders as the submarine circled  around us vainly seeking to get a position from which it could give us  a death blow with"]]]
