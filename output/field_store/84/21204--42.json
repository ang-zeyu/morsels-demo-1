He was sure to be back to-morrow, as he had taken  so little food with him. Drayton said nothing at the time, but  after dinner, when we were smoking on the stoep, he began to  quote to me:    'I met a lady in the meads,  Full beautiful a faery's child;  Her hair was long, her foot was light,  And her eyes were wild.'    'What do you mean to insinuate?' I said.    'Oh, I don't mean anything libelous. Browne hasn't gone off with  a comely Mashona. But, for all that, I believe he's taken Africa  much too seriously. She has a grim fascination for me, but she  doesn't stop at that with him. She grips him and orders him to  come along.'    'Tell me about today,' I said.    'Browne acknowledged a little to me three days ago,' Drayton  said. 'He told me that this huge Tamburlaine (or rather  Zenocrate) of a country was giving him too heady a welcome. He  said she was still in the Middle Ages, and not only there, but  more than half outside the pale of Christendom, such as it was  then. So she had strange forces at work in her, and used  incantations to allure, in prodigal variety. He talked about  Lapland, and some footling researches he had made into the magic  of the north. He also told me a horrible tale or two of the South  that he had found in the Bodleian. One was a real curdler, I can  tell you. Jerry Browne's own moustache seemed to turn up like a  German's as he imparted it to me. You know he's romantic enough  in his way, though he does lead such a repressed life. You should  see him at home.'    'But do tell me why he's gone off so suddenly,' said I, with some  impatience.    'I can't tell you very much,' said Drayton. 'We rode out, and  Jerry seemed tremendously cheerful quite sportive. Anyone who'd  only known him in Park Crescent would have been much surprised to  watch him and listen to the things he said. Mrs. Browne seemed a  bit puzzled, I thought, at last. Then we came to the kopjes where  there was a consummate view. You could see a long way to the  north across a hugely wide plain. Browne climbed up on the  highest rock with me a sort of flat slab, whereon you might  immolate a hecatomb. He seemed more exhilarated than ever just  then. Soon he slipped away down the rocks and left me smoking my  pipe on high. About five minutes after I observed him making  tracks across the northern plain. He was cantering his dappled  mule for all it was worth; he was carrying nothing so far as I  could see.    'I made haste down. I found that boy you said we could trust. I  gave him two or three picnic rugs and what was left of our food  to carry. I asked him to follow the rideaway, to stick to him,  and to bring him back as soon as ever he could. Then I went to  Mrs. Browne. She was sitting behind some bushes crying. She said  Browne had said such a curious good-bye to her. He had spoken of  riding on to see more of the country he had said he would be back  in the morning. She had tried to dissuade him, but he seemed  hardly to listen. She could scarcely believe that he had really  gone without blankets or food. I reassured her, telling her that  I had sent the boy and that you had said the boy was a good  'un. But if she thinks, or you think, that the old man will come  back tomorrow, I don't.'    Tuesday passed anxiously both for Mrs. Browne and for me. Drayton  was anxious in the wrong way, unless I misjudged him. I seemed to  read triumph in his face as the hours went by and brought no  Browne.    I grew haggard when evening drew on. What was I to do? But about  sunset tidings came. A native, who had traveled into town from  the north, brought me a penciled note from Johannes: 'My father,  I ask you to come to us. Let your horse make haste. The white man  will not turn. He has finished his food. He goes to the hills, he  says. I think that he is mad. Pray for us! Johannes.'    I went to Mrs. Browne at once. I remember I found her sitting  under a flaming hibiscus bush. She looked very pale and washed-out  against it. I told her that her husband wanted to extend his  tour. She burst into tears, and said she could not understand it.  Then I told her that I meant going after him in the morning to  try to hasten his return. She brightened up at that, and fell to  planning what I should take with me. What comforts could she send  Gerald in the comfortless desert without overloading me? I showed  Johannes' note to Drayton after dinner. He whistled, and, to his  credit, looked grave.    'I'm to go after him to-morrow,' I said. 'I've thought over it,  and I think you may as well come too. You may be useful, as  knowing his ways.'    He nodded. 'Rather bad about his running out of skoff, isn't it?'  he asked. 'I wonder if he's out of baccy and just breaking his  heart.' His plump face was pitiful.    'Don't you fret,' I answered. 'It only means he's run out of our  food. They'll surely buy monkey-nuts or sweet-potatoes or rice in  the kraals. He's probably developed a passion for native food by  now, also for native snuff. He'll be able to buy some of that,  surely.'    'Just so,' said Drayton. He began to quote again in a sort of  droning chant as if he were a chorus recording the onsweep of a  tragedy:    'I set her on my pacing steed, And nothing else saw all day long,  For sidelong would she lean, and sing A faery's song.    'She found me roots of relish sweet, And honey wild, and manna-dew,  And sure in language strange she said I love thee true.'    In the morning we got a flying start after all, though Drayton  was in bed when I came back from church. We went away at eight,  and soon found, to our joy, that we were really well mounted. It  was joy, too, to remember what a stubborn mule Browne had for  pacing steed. He had not got away far, we assured ourselves. But  we did not catch him that night.    We asked at kraals as we went along, and struck a hot scent about  three in the afternoon. A white man had passed that morning a  white man riding a dappled mule, with a boy carrying blankets  behind him. Straightway we gave our ponies an off-saddle.    Afterwards we rode on hard in what we deemed to be the right  direction till darkness fell: We sought shelter at a village  then. There was no village gossip, alas! about the passing of a  white man that day! They were good to us, though, those  villagers, and gave us beans and monkey-nuts for supper and  mealies for our ponies. After we had finished eating we spread  out the rush-mat they had lent us and lay down to smoke and  meditate and surmise as to our passionate pilgrim. They had given  us a hut that was old and grimy with fires. Its floor teemed with  life.    Therefore we changed our resting-place and went out to camp under  a rocky eminence. There with a bedrock of austere granite we  slept in peace. At glimmer of dawn we were saddling up. We rode  to another kraal, but the folk there had no news for us.    We were close on the hills now at last. We came to a low river at  the foot of them. We chose a landlocked pool that seemed to be  immune from crocodiles, for a plunge. Next I girded myself for  Sacrifice, and he served me. Then we made a fire and cooked a  huge breakfast in the hungry morning air. Drayton grew quite  lyrical as to the charm of the country before the meal was over.    'Browne's not far wrong about her,' he said; 'but there's reason  in all things.'    That whole day we heard no news and found no spoor or sign. The  hill-country gave us stiff climbing and rocky paths to ride.  Kraals and clusters of gardens places where we might hope to hear  tidings how few they were in that hill-country! We camped  disconsolately at last in a forlorn garden among grey boulders  where stumps of trees were burning. We found no trouble in  building up a good night fire of half-burnt logs. We gave our  ponies their nosebags and ate our own bread and bully rather  silently. Then we surmised with some weariness and gloom over our  pipes. At last we slept under the many eyes of the heavens.    About first cock-crow, when a chill struck through my blanket, I  opened my eyes and looked towards the fire. Someone was sitting  beside it watching me. Now that he saw me stirring he greeted me.    It was Johannes. 'I saw your fire but just now,' he said. 'Our  fire is up there beyond great rocks. The white man has been very  sick. I think he will come home now.'    I sprang to my feet and roused Drayton. He would not get up for a  long time. I suspect he combined breakfast and lunch fairly often  at Oxford. But I roused him mercilessly. I told him the news.    He argued in desperate fashion at first. 'How far's the sick  bed,' he asked.    'Not more than a mile or so,' said I.    'Need we go till morning?' said he.    'Shame!' said I.    At last he sprang up.    As we clambered among the boulders, piloted by Johannes, he  droned away at his chorus part:    'She took me to her elfin grot, And there she wept, and sighed  full sore, And there I shut her wild, sad eyes With kisses four.    'And there she lulled me asleep, And there I dream'd Ah woe  betide! The latest dream I ever dream'd On the cold hill's side.'    We found Browne in a nook among the rocks. A fire was burning  beside him. He seemed to be sleeping.    'He looks as if he'd been sick,' I said. 'We'd better let him  sleep on!'    'Yes; let's go to bed ourselves,' said Drayton, yawning.    So we lay down on opposite sides of the fire. Such a red and  splendid fire that cold cock-crow time!    Browne kept giving sharp little moans in his sleep, just as a dog  will do of nights.    'He's started a nightmare,' said I. 'I wish we could help him to  better dreams. I'd like to see what he sees just now.'    Drayton began to drone from his side of the fire:    'I saw pale kings and princes, too; Pale warriors death-pale were  they all. They cried, \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" hath thee in  thrall.

The Rhetorical part of his Discourse, though it make  not the least part of it, I shall say nothing to, designing to examine  only the Argumentative part, and leaving it to _Philoponus_ to answer  those passages wherein either _Paracelsus_ or _Chymists_ are  concern'd: I shall observe to You, that in what he has said besides,  he makes it his Business to do these two things. The one to propose  and make out an Experiment to demonstrate the common Opinion about the  four Elements; And the other, to insinuate divers things which he  thinks may repair the weakness of his Argument, from Experience, and  upon other Accounts bring some credit to the otherwise defenceless  Doctrine he maintains.    To begin then with his Experiment of the burning Wood, it seems to me  to be obnoxious to not a few considerable Exceptions.    And first, if I would now deal rigidly with my Adversary, I might here  make a great Question of the very way of Probation which he and others  employ, without the least scruple, to evince, that the Bodies commonly  call'd mixt, are made up of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, which they  are pleas'd also to call Elements; namely that upon the suppos'd  _Analysis_ made by the fire, of the former sort of _Concretes_, there  are wont to emerge Bodies resembling those which they take for the  Elements. For not to Anticipate here what I foresee I shall have  occasion to insist on, when I come to discourse with _Philoponus_  concerning the right that fire has to pass for the proper and  Universal Instrument of Analysing mixt Bodies, not to Anticipate that,  I say, if I were dispos'd to wrangle, I might alledge, that by  _Themistius_ his Experiment it would appear rather that those he calls  Elements, are made of those he calls mixt Bodies, then mix'd Bodies of  the Elements. For in _Themistius's_ Analyz'd Wood, and in other Bodies  dissipated and alter'd by the fire, it appears, and he confesses, that  which he takes for Elementary Fire and Water, are made out of the  Concrete; but it appears not that the Concrete was made up of Fire and  Water. Nor has either He, or any Man, for ought I know, of his  perswasion, yet prov'd that nothing can be obtained from a Body by the  fire that was not _Pre-existent_ in it.    At this unexpected objection, not only _Themistius_, but the rest of  the company appear'd not a little surpriz'd; but after a while  _Philoponus_ conceiving his opinion, as well as that of _Aristotle_,  concern'd in that Objection, You cannot sure (sayes he to  _Carneades_) propose this Difficulty; not to call it Cavill, otherwise  then as an Exercise of wit, and not as laying any weight upon it. For  how can that be separated from a thing that was not existent in it.  When, for instance, a Refiner mingles Gold and Lead, and exposing this  Mixture upon a Cuppell to the violence of the fire, thereby separates  it into pure and refulgent Gold and Lead (which driven off together  with the Dross of the Gold is thence call'd _Lithargyrium Auri_) can  any man doubt that sees these two so differing substances separated  from the Mass, that they were existent in it before it was committed  to the fire.    I should (replies _Carneades_) allow your Argument to prove something,  if, as Men see the Refiners commonly take before hand both Lead and  Gold to make the Mass you speak of, so we did see Nature pull down a  parcell of the Element of Fire, that is fancy'd to be plac'd I know  not how many thousand Leagues off, contiguous to the Orb of the Moon,  and to blend it with a quantity of each of the three other Elements,  to compose every mixt Body, upon whose Resolution the Fire presents  us with Fire, and Earth, and the rest. And let me add, _Philoponus_,  that to make your Reasoning cogent, it must be first prov'd, that the  fire do's only take the Elementary Ingredients asunder, without  otherwise altering them. For else 'tis obvious, that Bodies may afford  substances which were not pre-existent in them; as Flesh too long kept  produces Magots, and old Cheese Mites, which I suppose you will not  affirm to be Ingredients of those Bodies. Now that fire do's not  alwayes barely separate the Elementary parts, but sometimes at least  alter also the Ingredients of Bodies, if I did not expect ere long a  better occasion to prove it, I might make probable out of your very  Instance, wherein there is nothing Elementary separated by the great  violence of the Refiners fire: the Gold and Lead which are the two  Ingredients separated upon the _Analysis_ being confessedly yet  perfectly mixt Bodies, and the Litharge being Lead indeed; but such  Lead as is differing in consistence and other Qualities from what it  was before. To which I must add that I have sometimes seen, and so  questionlesse have you much oftener, some parcells of Glasse adhering  to the Test or Cuppel, and this Glass though Emergent as well as the  Gold or Litharge upon your Analysis, you will not I hope allow to have  been a third Ingredient of the Mass out of which the fire produc'd it.    Both _Philoponus_ and _Themistius_ were about to reply, when  _Eleutherius_ apprehending that the Prosecution of this Dispute would  take up time, which might be better employ'd, thought fit to prevent  them by saying to _Carneades_: You made at least half a Promise, when  you first propos'd this Objection, that you would not (now at least)  insist on it, nor indeed does it seem to be of absolute necessity to  your cause, that you should. For though you should grant that there  are Elements, it would not follow that there must be precisely four.  And therefore I hope you will proceed to acquaint us with your other  and more considerable Objections against _Themistius's_ Opinion,  especially since there is so great a Disproportion in Bulke betwixt  the Earth, Water and Air, on the one part, and those little parcells  of resembling substances, that the fire separates from _Concretes_ on  the other part, that I can scarce think that you are serious, when to  lose no advantage against your Adversary, you seem to deny it to be  rational, to conclude these great simple Bodies to be the Elements,  and not the Products of compounded ones.    What you alledge (replies _Carneades_) of the Vastness of the Earth  and Water, has long since made me willing to allow them to be the  greatest and chief Masses of Matter to be met with here below: But I  think I could shew You, if You would give me leave, that this will  prove only that the Elements, as You call them, are the chief Bodies  that make up the neighbouring part of the World, but not that they are  such Ingredients as every mixt Body must consist of. But since You  challenge me of something of a Promise, though it be not an entire  one, Yet I shall willingly perform it. And indeed I intended not when  I first mention'd this Objection, to insist on it at present against  _Themistius_, (as I plainly intimated in my way of proposing it:)  being only desirous to let you see, that though I discern'd my  Advantages, yet I was willing to forego some of them, rather then  appear a rigid Adversary of a Cause so weak, that it may with safety  be favourably dealt with. But I must here profess, and desire You to  take Notice of it, that though I pass on to another Argument, it is  not because I think this first invalid. For You will find in the  Progress of our Dispute, that I had some reason to question the very  way of Probation imploy'd both by Peripateticks and Chymists, to  evince the being and number of the Elements. For that there are such,  and that they are wont to be separated by the Analysis made by Fire,  is indeed taken for granted by both Parties, but has not (for ought I  know) been so much as plausibly attempted to be proved by either.  Hoping then that when we come to that part of our Debate, wherein  Considerations relating to this Matter are to be treated of, you will  remember what I have now said, and that I do rather for a while  suppose, then absolutely grant the truth of what I have question'd, I  will proceed to another Objection.    And hereupon _Eleutherius_ having promis'd him not to be unmindfull,  when time should serve, of what he had declar'd.    I consider then (sayes _Carneades_) in the next place, that there are  divers Bodies out of which _Themistius_ will not prove in haste, that  there can be so many Elements as four extracted by the Fire. And I  should perchance trouble him if I should ask him what Peripatetick can  shew us, (I say not, all the four Elements, for that would be too  rigid a Question, but) any one of them extracted out of Gold by any  degree of Fire whatsoever. Nor is Gold the only Bodie in Nature that  would puzzle an _Aristotelian_, that is no more [Errata: (that is no  more)] to analyze by the Fire into Elementary Bodies, since, for ought  I have yet observ'd, both Silver and calcin'd _Venetian_ Talck, and  some other Concretes, not necessary here to be nam'd, are so fixt,  that to reduce any of them into four Heterogeneous Substances has  hitherto prov'd a Task much too hard, not only for the Disciples of  _Aristotle_, but those of _Vulcan_, at least, whilst the latter have  employ'd only Fire to make the"]]]
