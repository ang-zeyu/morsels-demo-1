The men behind  him do not at first get into the altered swing, and for a moment or two  the rowing is scrambling, and our boat rolls unsteadily, a spectacle  hailed with increased joy by the partisans of the Old Boys' boat.    \"Steady now!\" cries Blades, over his shoulder, and next moment the boat  rights itself; the four oars dip and feather simultaneously.  I, sitting  in the stern, can feel the swing as of one man, and the boat dashes  forward like a machine.  Our fellows on the banks mark the change and  cheer tremendously.    \"Well spurted, Parkhurst!\"  \"Put it on now!\"  \"You're gaining!\"  \"Rowed  indeed!\"  Such were the cries which, as I heard them, set my blood  tingling with excitement.    It was a long time before any perceptible gain was noticeable from where  I sat.  The Old Boys had taken advantage of their lead to come across  into our water, and all I could see of them was the blades of their oars  on in front, which rose and fell swiftly and with a regular beat.    Still the shout from the bank was, \"You're gaining!\" and presently I saw  their boat edging off again into their own water, by which I concluded  we had pulled up sufficiently to make this necessary to avoid a foul.    Our men pulled splendidly.  Cool, determined, and plucky, each rowed his  best, his eyes fixed on the back of the man before him, keeping perfect  time, and pulling each stroke through with terrible energy.  I could see  by their pale looks that they shared the common excitement, but there  was no sign of flurry or distress, nothing but a quiet determination,  which augured better for the result of their efforts than all the shouts  of the onlookers.    Where are we now?  Those willows on my left are, I know, just half a  mile from the winning-post.  Shall we, in that distance, be able to pull  up the length which now divides us and our rivals?  There is a chance  yet!  The leading boat is not going as fast as it was a minute ago.  I  can tell that by the eddies from their oars which sweep past.    \"How much?\" inquired Blades again, as he swung forward.    \"One!\"  I replied.    I could see by the gleam in his eyes that he had hope still of making  that one length nothing before the winning-post was reached.    That shout from the bank means something, surely!    \"Well rowed indeed, Parkhurst!\"    \"They're overlapped!\"    Yes, those who could see it were watching the little pink flag at the  prow of our boat creeping, inch by inch, up the stern of our rivals'.  The eddies from their oars came past nearer now, and the \"thud\" of their  outriggers sounded closer.    Yes, we are gaining without doubt; but shall we overtake them in time to  avoid defeat?  I can see a mass of people ahead on the banks, and know  that they are gathered opposite the winning-post.  It can't be a quarter  of a mile off now!    Again that shout from the bank.  Ah, yes, our bow oar is level with  their stroke.  \"Now you have it!\" shout our fellows.    Blades turns his head for half a second, and cries to his men as he  quickens up to his final spurt.    What a shout then rent the air!  Our boat no longer crawled up beside  the Old Boys, but began to fly.  On, on!  Their coxswain seems to be  gliding backwards towards me.  In vain they attempt to answer our spurt;  they have not the rowing left in them to do it.  Nothing can stop us!  In another moment we are abreast, and almost instantly there come such  cheers after cheers from the bank that even the dash of the oars was  drowned in it.    \"Parkhurst's ahead!\"    \"Ah, well rowed!\"    \"Now, Old Boys!\"    \"It's a win!\"    On, on!  What sensation so glorious, so madly exciting, as that of one  of the crew of a winning boat within twenty yards of the goal?  I am  tempted to shout, to wave my hat, to do something ridiculous, but I set  my teeth and sit still, holding my breath.  Four strokes more will do  it.  One!  I am level with the stroke of the Old Boys' boat.  Two!  Our  fellows pull as if they had another half-mile to go still.  Three!  The  judge at the winning-post is lifting his hand and cocking his pistol.  Four!  Crack goes the signal! and as our men cease rowing, and the boat  shoots forward with the impetus of that last terrific stroke, amid the  cheers and shouts of the assembled crowd, I breathe again, knowing that  the Parkhurst boat has won, by three yards, the grandest race in which  it was ever my lot to take part.        CHAPTER FOUR.    PARKHURST VERSUS WESTFIELD.    \"Now, Parkhurst, turn out sharp!  They are going in first.\"  So shouted  Steel, the captain of our eleven, putting his head in at the door of the  tent in which we were arraying ourselves in flannels and spiked shoes,  and otherwise arming for the great match against Westfield School, which  was now about to commence.    We always looked upon these Westfield fellows as our most dangerous  rivals on the cricket field (much in the light in which we esteemed  Craven where football was concerned), and the match in which our  respective pretensions were yearly settled was, I need hardly say,  regarded as _the_ match of the season, and made the object of untiring  practice and feverish excitement.    Year after year, for twelve years, our rival elevens had met, always on  the last Saturday of June, one year at Parkhurst and the next at  Westfield, and so far the result had been that each school had won six  matches.  Fancy then the state of our feelings this year, as we started  off in the early morning on our omnibus from Parkhurst, to engage in the  decisive contest which (unless it ended in a draw) must turn the balance  either in favour of our school, or to the glorification of our rivals.  We could not bear to think of the possibility of a defeat; it would be  too tragical, too shameful.  So as we drove over to Westfield that  morning, we talked of nothing but victory, and felt very like those  determined old Spartans who, when they went to the wars, made a vow they  would return either with their shields or on them.    Of course there was a regular swarm of people to see the match.  Old  Parkhurst \"bats,\" who had played in the first match, thirteen years ago,  were there, with big beards, and very majestic to look at; Old Boys, now  settled in life, were there with their wives and children; carriages  full of our own and Westfield's fathers and mothers; and shoals of young  brothers and sisters, crammed the space beyond the flags; the \"doctors,\"  as usual, had driven over; and almost gave offence to some of our most  enthusiastic partisans by \"chumming up\" publicly with the head master of  our rivals!  And then, besides, there was a host of outsiders, drawn  together by simple curiosity or love of cricket; so that altogether, as  we emerged from our tent in our snow-white flannels and pink belts, we  felt that the eyes of the world were upon us, and were more convinced  than ever that anything short of victory would be the most terrible of  all calamities which could fall on our youthful heads.    Our great hope was in Steel, our captain, one of the best cricketers  Parkhurst had ever produced; and for coolness and self-confidence  without his equal anywhere.  We all adored him, for he never snubbed  youngsters, or made light of their doings.  If, during practice, a  fellow bowled, batted, or fielded well, Steel took care to encourage  him; but if any one played carelessly, or bungled, Steel scowled, and  that unlucky man's name disappeared for a season from the list of  candidates for a place in the first eleven.    See him now stroll up to the wickets, with his wicket-keeping pads on,  talking on the way to one of the two men who are to officiate first with  their bats on behalf of Westfield.    We youngsters can't understand such coolness, and keep our eyes on him,  as if every moment we expected to see him fell his rival to the earth.  It's a great matter to be used to a thing.  I, who was now making my  first appearance in the first eleven, felt as if the world began,  continued, and ended within the area of this Westfield meadow; but here  was some one who, to all appearances, made no more of the great match  than he would of his dinner.    But away now with all thoughts but cricket!  The ball we have been  tossing about idly is taken into custody by the umpire; Steel is behind  the wickets, looking round to see if we fielders are all in our places,  and motioning one or two of us to stand deeper or closer in, as he deems  advisable.  The Westfield batsman who is to receive the first over is  getting \"middle\"; our bowler is tucking up his sleeves, and gripping the  brand-new ball in his hand; the ground-keeper is chasing a few small  boys back behind the ropes; and the scorers in the big tent are dipping  their pens in the ink.    Altogether, it is a critical moment in my life--a moment that seems as  long as a whole day.    \"Play!\" cries the umpire; and our bowler delivers his first ball--not a  very alarming one, and evidently meant more as a test of the ball and  the pitch than as a serious attack on the enemy's wicket.  My readers of  course do not expect me to give a full, true, and particular account of  every ball bowled on that eventful day.  That would be as tedious for  them as for me.  But I shall do my best to recall the chief features of  the game as they presented themselves to me from my post, first at  cover-point, and (while our side was batting) from the tent and the  wickets.    The first few overs were not eventful.  They rarely are.  Our men had to  get used to the ground and the ball; and the batsmen chose to be  exceedingly careful how they hit out at first.  In the third over a  single run was made, and of course the Westfield fellows cheered as if  the match were already won.  Then gradually came one or two more  singles, a two, another one, a three, and then, just as the two batsmen  were getting into good humour and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#6)"],[1," space. The popinjay is always prominent; and I want some of  you to help me (for I have not time at present for the chase) in  hunting the parrot down on his first appearance in Europe. Just at this  particular time he contested favor even with the falcon; and I think it  a piece of good fortune that I chanced to draw for you, thinking only  of its brilliant color, the popinjay, which Carpaccio allows to be  present on the grave occasion of St. George's baptizing the princess  and her father.    38. And, indeed, as soon as the Christian poets begin to speak of the  singing of the birds, they show themselves in quite a different mood  from any that ever occurs to a Greek. Aristophanes, with infinitely  more skill, describes, and partly imitates, the singing of the  nightingale; but simply as beautiful sound. It \"fills the thickets  with honey;\" and if in the often-quoted--just because it is _not_  characteristic of Greek literature--passage of the Coloneus, a deeper  sentiment is shown, that feeling is dependent on association of the  bird-voices with deeply pathetic circumstances. But this troubadour  finds his heart in heaven by the power of the singing only:--        Trop parfoisaient beau servise      Ciz oiselles que je vous devise.      Il chantaient un chant ytel      Com fussent angle esperitel.    We want a moment more of word-chasing to enjoy this. \"Oiseau,\" as you  know, comes from \"avis;\" but it had at this time got \"oisel\" for its  singular number, of which the terminating \"sel\" confused itself with  the \"selle,\" from \"ancilla\" in domisella and demoiselle; and the  feminine form \"oiselle\" thus snatched for itself some of the  delightfulness belonging to the title of a young lady. Then note that  \"esperitel\" does not here mean merely spiritual, (because all angels  are spiritual) but an \"angle esperitel\" is an angel of the air. So  that, in English, we could only express the meaning in some such  fashion as this:--        They perfected all their service of love,      These maiden birds that I tell you of.      They sang such a song, so finished-fair,      As if they were angels, born of the air.    39. Such were the fancies, then, and the scenes, in which Englishmen  took delight in Chaucer's time. England was then a simple country; we  boasted, for the best kind of riches, our birds and trees, and our  wives and children. We had now grown to be a rich one; and our first  pleasure is in shooting our birds; but it has become too expensive for  us to keep our trees. Lord Derby, whose crest is the eagle and  child--you will find the northern name for it, the bird and bantling,  made classical by Scott--is the first to propose that wood-birds should  have no more nests. We must cut down all our trees, he says, that we  may effectively use the steam-plow; and the effect of the steam-plow, I  find by a recent article in the _Cornhill Magazine_, is that an English  laborer must not any more have a nest, nor bantlings, neither; but may  only expect to get on prosperously in life, if he be perfectly  skillful, sober, and honest, and dispenses, at least until he is  forty-five, with the \"luxury of marriage.\"    40. Gentlemen, you may perhaps have heard me blamed for making no  effort here to teach in the artisans' schools. But I can only say that,  since the future life of the English laborer or artisan (summing the  benefits to him of recent philosophy and economy) is to be passed in a  country without angels and without birds, without prayers and without  songs, without trees and without flowers, in a state of exemplary  sobriety, and (extending the Catholic celibacy of the clergy into  celibacy of the laity) in a state of dispensation with the luxury of  marriage, I do not believe he will derive either profit or  entertainment from lectures on the Fine Arts.          LECTURE II.[8]    THE SWALLOW.      41. We are to-day to take note of the form of a creature which gives us  a singular example of the unity of what artists call beauty, with the  fineness of mechanical structure, often mistaken for it. You cannot but  have noticed how little, during the years of my past professorship, I  have introduced any questions as to the nature of beauty. I avoided  them, partly because they are treated of at length in my books; and  partly because they are, in the last degree, unpractical. We are born  to like or dislike certain aspects of things; nor could I, by any  arguments, alter the defined tastes which you received at your birth,  and which the surrounding circumstances of life have enforced, without  any possibility of your voluntary resistance to them. And the result of  those surrounding circumstances, to-day, is that most English youths  would have more pleasure in looking at a locomotive than at a swallow;  and that many English philosophers would suppose the pleasure so  received to be through a new sense of beauty. But the meaning of the  word \"beauty\" in the fine arts, and in classical literature, is  properly restricted to those very qualities in which the locomotion of  a swallow differs from that of an engine.          [8] Delivered at Oxford, May 2d, 1873.    42. Not only from that of an engine; but also from that of animals in  whose members the mechanism is so complex as to give them a resemblance  to engines. The dart of the common house-fly, for instance, in full  strength, is a more wonderful movement than that of a swallow. The  mechanism of it is not only more minute, but the swiftness of the  action so much greater, that the vibration of the wing is invisible.  But though a school-boy might prefer the locomotive to the swallow, he  would not carry his admiration of finely mechanical velocity into  unqualified sympathy with the workmanship of the God of Ekron; and  would generally suppose that flies were made only to be food for the  more graceful fly-catcher,--whose finer grace you will discover, upon  reflection, to be owing to the very moderation and simplicity of its  structure, and to the subduing of that infinitude of joints, claws,  tissues, veins, and fibers which inconceivably vibrate in the  microscopic[9] creature's motion, to a quite intelligible and simple  balance of rounded body upon edged plume, maintained not without  visible, and sometimes fatigued, exertion, and raising the lower  creature into fellowship with the volition and the virtue of humanity.          [9] I call it so because the members and action of it cannot be        seen with the unaided eye.    43. With the virtue, I say, in an exceedingly qualified sense; meaning  rather the strength and art displayed in overcoming difficulties, than  any distinct morality of disposition. The bird has kindly and homely  qualities; but its principal \"virtue\" for _us_, is its being an  incarnate voracity, and that it moves as a consuming and cleansing  power. You sometimes hear it said of a humane person that they would  not kill a fly: from 700 to 1,000 flies a day are a moderate allowance  for a baby swallow.    44. Perhaps, as I say this, it may occur to some of you to think, for  the first time, of the reason of the bird's name. For it is very  interesting, as a piece of language study, to consider the different  power on our minds,--nay, the different sweetness to the ear,--which,  from association, these same two syllables receive, when we read them  as a noun, or as a verb. Also, the word is a curious instance of the  traps which are continually open for rash etymologists. At first,  nothing would appear more natural than that the name should have been  given to the bird from its reckless function of devouring. But if you  look to your Johnson, you will find, to your better satisfaction, that  the name means \"bird of porticos,\" or porches, from the Gothic \"swale;\"  \"subdivale,\"--so that he goes back in thought as far as Virgil's, \"Et  nunc porticibus vacuis, nunc humida circum, stagna sonat.\" Notice, in  passing, how a simile of Virgil's, or any other great master's, will  probably tell in two or more ways at once. Juturna is compared to the  swallow, not merely as winding and turning swiftly in her chariot, but  as being a water-nymph by birth,--\"Stagnis quae, fluminibusque sonoris,  praesidet.\" How many different creatures in one the swallow is by  birth, as a Virgilian simile is many thoughts in one, it would take  many more lectures than one to show you clearly; but I will indicate  them with such rough sketch as is possible.    45. It belongs, as most of you know, to a family of birds called  Fissirostres, or, literally, split-beaks. Split heads would be a better  term, for it is the enormous width of mouth and power of gaping which  the epithet is meant to express. A dull sermon, for instance, makes  half the congregation \"fissirostres.\" The bird, however, is most  vigilant when its mouth is widest, for it opens as a net to catch  whatever comes in its way,--hence the French, giving the whole family  the more literal name, \"Gobble-fly\"--Gobe-mouche, extend the term to  the open-mouthed and too acceptant appearance of a simpleton.    46. Partly in order to provide for this width of mouth, but more for  the advantage in flight, the head of the swallow is rounded into a  bullet shape, and sunk down on the shoulders, with no neck whatever  between, so as to give nearly the aspect of a conical rifle bullet to  the entire front of the body; and, indeed, the bird moves more like a  bullet than an arrow--dependent on a certain impetus of weight rather  than on sharp penetration of the air. I say dependent on, but I have  not yet been able to trace distinct relation between the shapes of  birds and their powers of flight. I suppose the form of the body is  first determined by the general habits and food, and that nature can  make any form she chooses volatile; only one point I think is always  notable, that a complete master of the art of flight must be  short-necked, so that he turns altogether, if he turns at all.
