But the Provencals who  wrought against him are not smiling; and forsooth he goes an ill  road who makes harm for himself of another's good deed.[1] Four  daughters, and each a queen, had Raymond Berenger, and Romeo, a  humble person and a pilgrim, did this[2] for him. And then  crooked words moved him to demand a reckoning of this just man,  who rendered to him seven and five for ten. Then he departed,  poor and old, and if the world but knew the heart he had, while  begging his livelihood bit by bit, much as it lauds him it would  laud him more.\"    [1] According to Giovanni Villani (vi. 90), one Romeo, a pilgrim,  came to the court of Raymond Berenger IV., Count of Provence (who  died, in 1245), and winning the count's favor, served him with  such wisdom and fidelity that by his means his master's revenues  were greatly increased, and his four daughters married to four  kings,--Margaret, to Louis IX. of France, St. Louis; Eleanor, to  Henry III. of England; Sanzia, to Richard, Earl of Cornwall  (brother of Henry III.), elected King of the Romans; and  Beatrice, to Charles of Anjou (brother of Louis IX.), King of  Apulia and Sicily. The Provencal nobles, jealous of Romeo,  procured his dismissal, and he departed, with his mule and his  pilgrim's staff and scrip, and was never seen more.    [2] The making each a queen.

And it and the others moved  with their dance, and like swiftest sparks veiled themselves to  me with sudden distance. I was in doubt, and was saying to  myself, \"Tell her, tell her,\" I was saying, \"tell her, my Lady,  who slakes my thirst with her sweet distillings;\" but that  reverence which lords it altogether over me, only by BE and by  ICE,[4] bowed me again like one who drowses. Little did Beatrice  endure me thus, and she began, irradiating me with a smile such  as would make a man in the fire happy, \"According to my  infallible advisement, how a just vengeance could be justly  avenged has set thee thinking. But I will quickly loose thy mind:  and do thou listen, for my words will make thee a present of a  great doctrine.    [1] \"Hosanna!

This  nature, united with its Maker, became sincere and good, as it had  been created; but by itself it had been banished from Paradise,  because it turned aside from the way of truth and from its own  life. The punishment therefore which the cross afforded, if it be  measured by the nature assumed, none ever so justly stung; and,  likewise, none was ever of such great wrong, regarding the Person  who suffered, with whom this nature was united. Therefore from  one act issued things diverse; for unto God and unto the Jews one  death was pleasing: by it earth trembled and the heavens were  opened. No more henceforth ought it to seem perplexing to thee,  when it is said that a just vengeance was afterward avenged by a  just court,    \"But I see now thy mind tied up, from thought to thought, within  a knot the loosing of which is awaited with great desire, Thou  sayest, 'I discern clearly that which I bear; but it is occult to  we why God should will only this mode for our redemption.' This  decree, brother, stands buried to the eyes of every one whose wit  is not full grown in the flame of love. Truly, inasmuch as on  this mark there is much gazing, and little is discerned, I will  tell why such mode was most worthy. The Divine Goodness, which  from Itself spurns all rancor, burning in Itself so sparkles that  It displays the eternal beauties. That which distils  immediately[1] from It, thereafter has no end, for when It  seals, Its imprint is not removed. That which from It immediately  rains down is wholly free, because it is not subject unto the  power of the new things.[2] It is the most conformed to It, and  therefore pleases It the most; for the Holy Ardor which  irradiates every thing is most living in what is most resemblance  to Itself. With all these things[3] the human creature is  advantaged, and if one fail, he needs must fall from his  nobility. Sin alone is that which disfranchises him, and makes  him unlike the Supreme Good, so that by Its light he is little  illumined. And to his dignity he never returns, unless, where sin  makes void, he fill up for evil pleasures with just penalties.  Your nature, when it sinned totally in its seed,[4] was removed  from these dignities, even as from Paradise; nor could they be  recovered, if thou considerest full subtly, by any way, without  passing by one of these fords:--either that God alone by His  courtesy should forgive, or that man by himself  should make satisfaction for his folly. Fix now thine eye within  the abyss of the eternal counsel, fixed as closely on my speech  as thou art able. Man within his own limits could never make  satisfaction, through not being able to descend so far with  humility in subsequent obedience, as disobeying he intended to  ascend; and this is the reason why man was excluded from power  to make satisfaction by himself. Therefore it behoved God by His  own paths[5] to restore man to his entire life, I mean by one, or  else by both. But because the work of the workman is so much the  more pleasing, the more it represents of the goodness of the  heart whence it issues, the Divine Goodness which imprints the  world was content to proceed by all Its paths to lift you up  again; nor between the last night and the first day has there  been or will there be so lofty and so magnificent a procedure  either by one or by the other; for God was more liberal in giving  Himself to make man sufficient to lift himself up again, than if  only of Himself He had pardoned him. And all the other modes were  scanty in respect to justice, if the Son of God had not humbled  himself to become incarnate.    [1] Without the intervention of a second cause.    [2] That is, of the heavens, new as compared with the First  Cause.    [3] That is, with immediate creation, with immortality, with free  will, with likeness to God, and the love of God for it.

Truth may be here interpreted, according to St. Thomas  Aquinas, as justice.      \"Now to fill completely every desire of thine, I return to a  certain place to clear it up, in order that thou mayest see there  even, as I do. Thou sayest, 'I see the water, I see the fire,  the air; and the earth, and all their mixtures come to  corruption, and endure short while, and yet these things were  created;' so that, if what I have said has been true, they ought  to be secure against corruption.

Elizabeth continued the old tradition, but they are only mentioned and  known by the Expenses books. It is said that at Christmas 1559 she was  displeased with something in the play performed before her, and  commanded the players to leave off. There was also a masque for her  amusement on Twelfth Night.    Of James I.'s first Christ-tide in England we have the following in a  letter from the Lady Arabella Stuart to the Earl of Shrewsbury, 3rd  December 1603:--    \"The Queen intendeth to make a mask this Christmass, to which my lady  of Suffolk and my lady Walsingham have warrants to take of the late  Queen's apparell out of the Tower at their discretion. Certain  gentlemen, whom I may not yet name, have made me of theyr counsell,  intend another. Certain gentlemen of good sort another. It is said  there shall be 30 playes. The king will feast all the Embassadours  this Christmass.\"    The death of the infant Princess Mary in September 1607 did not  interfere with James I. keeping Christmas right royally in that year.  There were masques and theatricals--nay, the king wanted a play acted  on Christmas night--and card-playing went on for high sums, the queen  losing L300 on the eve of Twelfth night.    It was, probably, the exceeding license of Christ-tide that made the  sour Puritans look upon its being kept in remembrance, as vain and  superstitious; at all events, whenever in their power, they did their  best to crush it. Take, for instance, the first Christmas day after  the landing of the so-called \"Pilgrim Fathers\" at Plymouth Rock in  1620, and read the deliberate chilliness and studied slight of the  whole affair, which was evidently more than the ship's master could  bear.    \"Munday, the 25 Day, we went on shore, some to fell tymber, some to  saw, some to riue, and some to carry, so that no man rested all that  day, but towards night, some, as they were at worke, heard a noyse of  some Indians, which caused vs all to goe to our Muskets, but we heard  no further, so we came aboord againe, and left some twentie to keepe  the court of gard; that night we had a sore storme of winde and raine.  Munday the 25 being Christmas day, we began to drinke water aboord,  but at night, the Master caused vs to have some Beere, and so on board  we had diverse times now and then some Beere, but on shore none at  all.\"    That this working on Christmas day was meant as an intentional  slight--for these pious gentlemen would not work on the Sunday--is, I  think, made patent by the notice by William Bradford, of how they kept  the following Christmas.    \"One ye day called Christmas-day, ye Gov'r caled them out to worke (as  was used), but ye most of this new company excused themselves, and  said it went against their consciences to worke on ye day. So ye Gov'r  tould them that if they made it a mater of conscience, he would spare  them till they were better informed. So he led away y^{e} rest, and  left them: but when they came home at noone from their worke, he found  them in ye streete at play, openly; some pitching ye barr, and some at  stoole ball, and such like sports. So he went to them and tooke away  their implements, and told them it was against his conscience that  they should play, and others worke. If they made ye keeping of it  matter of devotion, let them kepe their houses, but there should be no  gameing or revelling in ye streets. Since which time nothing hath been  attempted that way, at least, openly.\"    But we shall hear more of the Puritans and Christ-tide, only my scheme  is to treat the season chronologically, and, consequently, there must  be a slight digression; and the following ballad, which must have been  published in the time of James I., because of the allusion to yellow  starch (Mrs. Turner having been executed for the poisoning of Sir  Thomas Overbury in 1615), gives us         CHRISTMAS'S LAMENTATION         Christmas is my name, far have I gone,         Without regard; without regard.       Whereas great men by flocks there be flown,         To London-ward--to London Ward.       There they in pomp and pleasure do waste       That which Old Christmas was wonted to feast,           Well a day!       Houses where music was wont for to ring,       Nothing but bats and owlets do sing.           Well a day, Well a day.             Well a day, where should I stay?         Christmas beef and bread is turn'd into stones,         Into stones and silken rags;       And Lady Money sleeps and makes moans,         And makes moans in misers' bags;       Houses where pleasures once did abound,       Nought but a dog and a shepherd is found,           Well a day!       Places where Christmas revels did keep,       Now are become habitations for sheep.           Well a day, Well a day,             Well a day, where should I stay?         Pan, the shepherds' god, doth deface,         Doth deface Lady Ceres' crown,       And the tillage doth go to decay,         To decay in every town;       Landlords their rents so highly enhance,       That Pierce, the ploughman, barefoot may dance;           Well a day!       Farmers that Christmas would still entertain,       Scarce have wherewith themselves to maintain,           Well a day, etc.         Come to the countryman, he will protest,         Will protest, and of bull-beef boast;       And, for the citizen, he is so hot,         Is so hot, he will burn the roast.       The courtier, sure good deeds will not scorn,       Nor will he see poor Christmas forlorn?           Well a day!       Since none of these good deeds will do,       Christmas had best turn courtier too,           Well a day, etc.         Pride and luxury they do devour,         Do devour house keeping quite;       And soon beggary they do beget,         Do beget in many a knight.       Madam, forsooth, in her coach must wheel       Although she wear her hose out at heel,           Well a day!       And on her back wear that for a weed,       Which me and all my fellows would feed.           Well a day, etc.         Since pride came up with the yellow starch,         Yellow starch--poor folks do want,       And nothing the rich men will to them give,         To them give, but do them taunt;       For Charity from the country is fled,       And in her place hath nought left but need;           Well a day!       And corn is grown to so high a price,       It makes poor men cry with weeping eyes.           Well a day, etc.         Briefly for to end, here do I find,         I do find so great a vocation,       That most great houses seem to attain,         To attain a strong purgation;       Where purging pills such effects they have shew'd,       That forth of doors they their owners have spued;           Well a day!       And where'er Christmas comes by, and calls,       Nought now but solitary and naked walls.           Well a day, etc.         Philemon's cottage was turn'd into gold,         Into gold, for harbouring Jove:       Rich men their houses up for to keep,         For to keep, might their greatness move;       But, in the city, they say, they do live,       Where gold by handfulls away they do give;--           I'll away,       And thither, therefore, I purpose to pass,       Hoping at London to find the Golden Ass.           I'll away, I'll away,             I'll away, for here's no stay.    A little light upon this ballad may possibly be found in a letter from  John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton (21st December 1627):--\"Divers  lords and personages of quality have made means to be dispensed  withall for going into the Country this Christmas according to the  proclamation; but it will not be granted, so that they pack away on  all sides for fear of the worst.\"    As we are now getting near the attempted suppression of Christmas  under the Puritan _regime_, it may be as well to notice the extreme  licence to which the season's holiday and festivities had reached--and  perhaps a more flagrant case than the following can scarcely be given.  On 13th January 1626 the Commissioners of the Navy write to the Duke  of Buckingham that they have received information from persons who  have been on board the _Happy Entrance_ in the Downs, and the  _Nonsuch_ and _Garland_ at Gore-end, that for these Christmas  holidays, the captains, masters, boatswains, gunners, and carpenters,  were not aboard their ships, nor gave any attendance to the service,  leaving the ships a prey to any who might have assaulted them. The  Commissioners sent down clothes for the sailors, and there were no  officers to take charge of them, and the pressed men ran away as fast  as the Commissioners sent them down. If they had beaten up and down,  they might have prevented the loss of two English ships taken by the  Dunkirkers off Yarmouth.    This, naturally, was a state of things which could not be allowed, and  on January 15 the Duke of Buckingham wrote to Sir Henry Palmer as to  the officers and men quitting their ships at Christmas time, and  called upon him \"presently to repair on board his own ship, and to  charge the officers of all the ships composing his fleet, not to  depart from their ships without order.\"          CHAPTER IV         Attempts of Puritans to put down Christ-tide--Attitude of       the people--Preaching before Parliament--\"The Arraignment,       etc., of Christmas.\"      As soon as the Puritans became at all powerful, their iconoclastic  zeal naturally attacked Christmas, and the Scotchmen, such as Baillie,  Rutherford, Gillespie, and Henderson, in the Westminster Assembly of  Divines, tried in 1643 to get "]]]
