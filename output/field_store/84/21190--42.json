As to Bulgaria, our diplomacy harboured a different project:  the reconstruction of the Balkan League of 1912 in our favour, on the  basis of territorial concessions to be made to Bulgaria by Servia and  Greece, who were to be compensated by dividing Albania between them.  Greece also had from England an alternative suggestion--expansion in Asia  Minor: a vague and {20} unofficial hint, destined to assume imposing  dimensions later on.  At this stage, however, the whole project lacked  precise outline.  One plan of the reconstructed League included  Rumania--who also was to make concessions to Bulgaria and to receive  compensations at the expense of Austria; and the League was to be brought  into the field on the side of the Entente.  Another plan had less  ambitious aims: Servia and Greece by conciliating Bulgaria were to  prevent a combination of Rumania, Bulgaria, and Turkey, or of Bulgaria  and Turkey, on the side of the Central Powers.  The more sanguine plan  was especially cherished by Great Britain; the other by Russia, who  feared a Rumano-Bulgaro-Turkish combination against her.  But the  key-stone in both was Bulgaria, whose co-operation, or at least  neutrality, was to be purchased at the cost of Servia and Greece.[8]  Meanwhile, the less serious the Entente Powers' hopes for Turkey's  neutrality, the more lively their anxiety must have been about Bulgaria's  attitude; and it is not improbable that in repelling King Constantine's  offer, they were actuated not so much by the wish to avoid Turkish  hostility--the reason given--as by the fear lest the stipulation which  accompanied his offer, if accepted, should provoke Bulgaria.    Highly speculative as this project was, it might have materialized if  Serbs and Greeks were willing to pay the price.  But neither Serbs nor  Greeks would think of such a thing.  At the mere report that they were  about to be asked to cede Cavalla, the Greeks went mad, and M.  Venizelos  himself, though he favoured the reconstruction of the Balkan League,  loudly threatened, if the demand was formulated, to resign.  Whereupon,  his consternation having been transmitted to the Entente capitals, he  received an assurance that no demand of the sort would be made[9]--for  the present.

Both enterprises  were \"under consideration\"--which means that the Entente Cabinets were  busy discussing both and unable to decide on either.  Distracted by  conflicting aims and hampered by inadequate resources, they could not act  except tentatively and in an experimental fashion.    At the beginning of November the representatives of France, England, and  Russia at Athens collectively seconded a Servian appeal for assistance to  M. Venizelos, which the Greek Premier met with a flat refusal.  He gave  his reasons: such action, he said, would infallibly expose Greece to  aggression from Bulgaria, and it was more than probable that an automatic  agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey might engage the Greek army in a  struggle with the forces of three Powers at once.  Even if the attack  came from Bulgaria alone, he added, the Greek army needed three weeks to  concentrate at Salonica and another month to reach the theatre of the  Austro-Servian conflict, and in that interval the Bulgarian army,  invading Servia, would render impossible all contact between the Greek  and Servian armies.  The Entente Ministers endeavoured to overcome these  objections by assuring M. Venizelos that Bulgaria could not possibly  range herself against Russia, France, and England; and besides, they  said, their Governments could ask Rumania to guarantee Bulgarian  neutrality.  M. Venizelos replied that, if the co-operation of Bulgaria  with Rumania and Greece were secured, then the Greeks could safely assist  Servia in an effective manner; or the next best thing might be an  undertaking by Rumania to guarantee the neutrality of Bulgaria; and he  proceeded to ascertain the Rumanian Government's views on the subject.  He learnt that, in {22} answer to a question put to the Rumanian Premier  by the Entente Ministers at Bucharest, \"whether he would undertake to  guarantee the neutrality of Bulgaria towards Greece if the latter Power  sent succour to the Serbs,\" M. Bratiano, while professing the greatest  goodwill towards Greece and the Entente, declined to give any such  undertaking.[1]  Add another important fact to which the Greek Government  had its attention very earnestly drawn about this time--that not only  Servia, but even Belgium, experienced the greatest difficulty in  procuring from France the munitions and money necessary for continuing  the struggle.[2]    In the circumstances, there was no alternative for M. Venizelos but to  adopt the prudent attitude which on other occasions he was pleased to  stigmatize as \"pro-German.\"  True, his refusal to move in November was  hardly consistent with his eagerness to do so in August; but, taking into  account his temperament, we must assume that he had made that rash _a  titre gracieux_ offer blindfold.  Events had not borne out his  predictions of a speedy victory, and, though his faith in the ultimate  triumph of the Entente remained unshaken, he had come to realize that,  for the present at any rate, it behoved Hellas to walk warily.[3]    Some ten weeks passed, and then (23 January, 1915) Sir Edward Grey again  asked M. Venizelos for assistance to Servia in the common interest; as  Austria and Germany seemed bent on crushing her, it was essential that  all who could should lend her their support.  If Greece ranged herself by  Servia's side as her ally, the Entente Powers would willingly accord her  very important territorial concessions on the Asia Minor Coast.  The  matter was {23} urgent, for, were Servia crushed, though the ultimate  defeat of Austria and Germany would not be thereby affected, there would  during the War come about in the Balkans accomplished facts which would  make it difficult or even impossible for either Servia or Greece to  obtain afterwards arrangements as favourable as those actually in view.  Conversely, the immediate participation of Greece and Rumania in the War  would, by bringing about the defeat of Austria, secure the realization of  Greek, Rumanian and Servian aspirations.  To render such participation  effective, it was desirable that Bulgaria should be assured that, if  Servian and Greek aspirations elsewhere were realized, she would obtain  satisfactory compensations in Macedonia, on condition that she came in or  at least maintained a not malevolent neutrality.  But the question of  compensations affected chiefly Servia: all he asked of M. Venizelos on  that point was not to oppose any concessions that Servia might be  inclined to make to Bulgaria.    Whether this semi-official request amounted to a proposal or was merely  in the nature of a suggestion is hard to determine.  But M. Venizelos  seems to have understood it in the latter sense, for in speaking of it he  made use of the very informal adjective \"absurd.\"  No one, indeed, could  seriously believe that Bulgaria would be induced to co-operate, or even  to remain neutral, by the hypothetical and partial promises which Sir  Edward Grey indicated; and with a potentially hostile Bulgaria in her  flank Greece could not march to Servia's aid.  So M. Venizelos, under the  impulse of ambition, set his energetic brain to work, and within a few  hours produced a scheme calculated to correct the \"absurdity\" of the  British notion, to earn the gratitude of the Entente to himself, and an  Asiatic Empire for his country.  It was nothing less than a complete  reversal of his former attitude: that Greece should not only withdraw her  opposition to concessions on the part of Servia, but should voluntarily  sacrifice Cavalla to the Bulgars, provided they joined the Allies  forthwith.  This scheme he embodied in a lengthy memorandum which he  submitted to the King.    M. Venizelos recognized how painful a sacrifice the cession of Cavalla  would be, and therefore he had to use very strong arguments to commend it  to his Majesty.  In the {24} first place, he emphasized the imperative  need of helping Servia, since, should Servia be crushed, the  Austro-German armies might be tempted to advance on Salonica, or Bulgaria  might be invited to take possession of Servian Macedonia, in which case  Greece would have either to let the Balkan balance of power go by the  board, or, in accordance with her Treaty, go to Servia's assistance under  much more disadvantageous conditions.  In the second place, he argued  that the sacrifice of Cavalla was well worth making, since Greece would  eventually receive in Asia Minor compensations which would render her  greater and more powerful than the most sanguine Greek could even have  dreamt a few years before; and in Macedonia itself the loss of Cavalla  could be partially compensated for by a rectification of frontiers  involving the acquisition from Servia of the Doiran-Ghevgheli district.    In the event of Bulgaria accepting Cavalla and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#6)"],[1,"approaches Raffaelle nearer than any of the Flemish or Dutch  painters. Of course, as a colourist and master of light and shade, he  is all powerful; but I allude, at present, to the mere conception and  embodying of his subjects on this head.    Fuseli says,--\"Rembrandt was, in my opinion, a genius of the first  class in whatever relates not to form. In spite of the most portentous  deformity, and without considering the spell of his _chiaro-scuro_, such  were his powers of nature, such the grandeur, pathos, or simplicity of  his composition, from the most elevated or extensive arrangement to  the meanest and most homely, that the best cultivated eye, the purest  sensibility, and the most refined taste, dwell on them equally  enthralled. Shakspere alone excepted, no one combined with so much  transcendent excellence so many, in all other men unpardonable,  faults,--and reconciled us to them. He possessed the full empire of  light and shade, and of all the tints that float between them; he tinged  his pencil with equal success in the cool of dawn, in the noon-day ray,  in the livid flash, in evanescent twilight, and rendered darkness  visible. Though made to bend a steadfast eye on the bolder phenomena of  nature, yet he knew how to follow her into her calmest abodes, gave  interest to insipidity and baldness, and plucked a flower in every  desert. None ever, like Rembrandt, knew how to improve an accident into  a beauty, or give importance to a trifle. If ever he had a master, he  had no followers; Holland was not made to comprehend his power.\"    And in another lecture, speaking of the advantage of a low horizon, he  says:--\"What gives sublimity to Rembrandt's Ecce Homo more than this  principle? a composition which, though complete, hides in its grandeur  the limits of its scenery. Its form is a pyramid, whose top is lost in  the sky, as its base in tumultuous murky waves. From the fluctuating  crowds who inundate the base of the tribunal, we rise to Pilate,  surrounded and perplexed by the varied ferocity of the sanguinary  synod to whose remorseless gripe he surrenders his wand, and from  him we ascend to the sublime resignation of innocence in Christ, and,  regardless of the roar, securely repose on his countenance. Such is the  grandeur of a conception, which in its blaze absorbs the abominable  detail of materials too vulgar to be mentioned. Had the materials been  equal to the conception and composition, the Ecce Homo of Rembrandt,  even unsupported by the magic of its light and shade, or his spell of  colours, would have been an assemblage of superhuman powers.\"    Reynolds, in his Eighth Discourse, speaking of the annoyance the mind  feels at the display of too much variety and contrast, proceeds to  say:--\"To apply these general observations, which belong equally to all  arts, to ours in particular. In a composition, where the objects are  scattered and divided into many equal parts, the eye is perplexed and  fatigued, from not knowing where to find the principal action, or which  is the principal figure; for where all are making equal pretensions to  notice, all are in equal danger of neglect. The expression which is used  very often on these occasions is, the piece wants repose--a word which  perfectly expresses a relief of the mind from that state of hurry and  anxiety which it suffers when looking at a work of this character. On  the other hand, absolute unity, that is, a large work consisting of one  group or mass of light only, would be as defective as an heroic poem  without episode, or any collateral incidents to recreate the mind with  that variety which it requires. An instance occurs to me of two painters  (Rembrandt and Poussin) of characters totally opposite to each other in  every respect, but in nothing more than in their mode of composition and  management of light and shadow. Rembrandt's manner is absolute unity; he  often has but one group, and exhibits little more than one spot of light  in the midst of a large quantity of shadow: if he has a second mass that  second bears no proportion to the principal. Poussin, on the contrary,  has scarcely any principle mass of light at all, and his figures are  often too much dispersed, without sufficient attention to place them in  groups. The conduct of these two painters is entirely the reverse of  what might be expected from their general style and character, the works  of Poussin being as much distinguished for simplicity as those of  Rembrandt for combination. Even this conduct of Poussin might proceed  from too great affection to simplicity of another kind, too great a  desire to avoid the ostentation of art with regard to light and shadow,  on which Rembrandt so much wished to draw the attention; however, each  of them ran into contrary extremes, and it is difficult to determine  which is the most reprehensible, both being equally distant from the  demands of nature and the purposes of art.\"    This unity is observable in the composition of Rembrandt; even where  a multiplicity of figures are employed, they are so grouped that the  masses of light and shade are interrupted as little as possible; and it  is only in his earlier works, such as those now in the Munich Gallery,  where this isolated light is carried to extravagance. In many of his  later pictures, we have not only subordinate groups, but a repetition  of the principal lights; also a greater breadth of half-tint.  \"Composition,\" says Reynolds, \"which is the principal part of the  invention of a painter, is by far the greatest difficulty he has to  encounter. Every man that can paint at all, can execute individual  parts; but to keep these parts in due subordination as relative to a  whole, requires a comprehensive view of the art, that more strongly  implies genius than perhaps any other quality whatever.\" Now Rembrandt  possessed this power in an eminent degree. At the revival of painting  in Italy, the compositions consisted entirely of subjects taken from  Sacred Writ--subjects that imposed a purity of thought and a primitive  simplicity upon the artists; these qualities were, however, in a great  measure lost in passing through the Venetian and German schools, where  either the love for pictorial effect or the introduction of catholic  ceremonies took precedence of every other arrangement. The prolific  genius of Rubens spread this infectious mode of treatment through  Flanders and Holland, till at length, in the hands of the painters of  smoking and drinking scenes, historical subjects, even of a sacred  character, became quite ridiculous. Yet, with all these examples of bad  and vulgar taste around him, we find many compositions of Rembrandt less  degraded by mean representation than many of the best of the works of  the Venetian and Flemish painters. Take, for example, his design of  Christ and his Disciples at Emmaus, the principal figure in which is  certainly more refined than the Christ either in the pictures of Titian  or Rubens of the same subject; in fact, the idea of it is taken from the  Last Supper, by Raffaelle, (the Mark Antonio print of which he must have  had.) Raffaelle is indebted for the figure to Leonardo da Vinci; and if  we were to trace back, I have no doubt we should find that the Milanese  borrowed it from an earlier master; indeed, we perceive in the progress  of painting much of the primitive simplicity and uniformity preserved  in the best works of the Italian school. It was only when composition  passed through the prolific minds of such artists as Paul Veronese,  Tintoret, and Rubens, that it was made subservient to the bustle,  animation, and picturesque effect of their works. When we find,  therefore, any remains revived in the pictures of Rembrandt, who was  surrounded by compositions of a vulgar and low cast, we can only ascribe  it to the taste and genius of this great painter. In the design just  mentioned, the idea of the Disciples, as if struck with astonishment  and awe at the bursting forth of the divinity of Christ, is admirably  conceived. As the heads are taken from the people of his country, they  of necessity partake of the character of the people. This cannot be  justified, though it is excusable. Reynolds, on this head, speaking  of the ennobling of the characters in an historical picture, says,  \"How much the great style exacts from its professors to conceive and  represent their subjects in a poetical manner, not confined to mere  matter of fact, may be seen in the Cartoons of Raffaelle. In all the  pictures in which the painter has represented the apostles, he has  drawn them with great nobleness; he has given them as much dignity as  the human figure is capable of receiving. Yet we are expressly told in  Scripture they had no such respectable appearance; and of St. Paul  in particular we are told by himself that his _bodily_ presence was  _mean_. In conformity to custom, I call this part of the art History  Painting: it ought to be called Poetical, as in reality it is.\" He  further adds, \"The painter has no other means of giving an idea of the  mind but by that external appearance which grandeur of thought does  generally, though not always, impress on the countenance, and by that  correspondence of figure to sentiment and situation which all men wish,  but cannot command.\" As I cannot defend the mean appearance of the  disciples, neither shall I exculpate our great artist from blame in  introducing a dog into so grand a subject; we can only excuse him on  the plea of following the practice of his predecessors. Titian, in his  celebrated picture, has not only introduced a dog, but a cat also, which  is quarrelling with the former for a bone under the table. To this love  for the introduction of animals into their compositions, for the sake of  picturesque variety, many of the greatest painters must plead guilty;  and though the incongruity has been pointed out over and over again by  the writers on art, it "]]]
