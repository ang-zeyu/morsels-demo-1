Here the first experience of sleeping in a waggon was gone through, and  very comical it seemed to boys who were accustomed to the comforts of a  well-regulated home.    Dick laughed, and said that it was like sleeping in the attic, while the  servants slept in the kitchen, for the drivers and the three Zulus made  themselves snug under the waggon, Dinny joining them very unwillingly,  after a verbal encounter with Dick, who, however much he might be  wanting in bodily strength, was pretty apt with his tongue.    \"Sure, Masther Dick, sir, Dinny's the last boy in the world to grumble;  but I'm a good Christian, and the blacks are as haythen as can be.\"    \"Well, Dinny, and what of that?\"    \"Why, ye see, Masther Dick, I'm a white man, and they are all blacks;  and,\" he added with a grin, \"I shouldn't like to catch the complaint.\"    \"What complaint, Dinny?\"    \"Why, sure, sir, it would be very painful to you and Masther Jack there,  and the masther himself, if you found poor Dinny get up some fine  morning as black as a crow.\"    \"Get along with you,\" cried Jack.    \"Oh, be easy, Masther Jack, dear,\" cried Dinny; \"and how would you like  to slape under a waggon wid five sacks of smoking and living coals like  them Zulus and Kaffirs is?\"    \"I wouldn't mind,\" replied Jack.  \"We are on a hunting expedition, and  we must take things in the rough.\"    \"Sure an' it is rough indade,\" grumbled Dinny.  \"I'm thinking I'd rather  go sthraight home to my poor owld mother's cabin, and slape there dacent  like, wid nothing worse in it than the poor owld pig.\"        CHAPTER SIX.    A FALSE ALARM.    Mr Rogers had felt a little hesitation in giving the fierce-looking  Zulu permission to make one of the party, but as they journeyed on  across the apparently interminable plains between the Vaal and the Great  Crocodile rivers, he awoke more and more to the fact that he had secured  a valuable ally.  For the old warrior entered into the spirit of the  expedition at once, helping with the oxen or to extricate the waggons in  difficult places, showing himself quite at home in the management of  horses, and being evidently an excellent guide, and above all a hunter  of profound knowledge and experience.    As soon as he realised the intentions of Mr Rogers, he became most  earnest in his endeavours to get the party well on their way farther and  farther into the wilds, making the eyes of the boys dilate as he told  them in fair English of the herds of antelope and other game he would  soon show them in the plains; the giraffes, buffaloes, elephants, and,  above all, the lions, whose haunts he knew, and to which he promised to  take them.    Whenever the father began to talk in this strain his two sons grew  excited, and started to perform hunting dances, in which the number of  imaginary lions and buffaloes they slew was something enormous.  Every  now and then, too, the boys killed some imaginary elephant, out of whose  unwieldy head they made believe to hack the tusks, which they invariably  brought and laid at their young masters' feet, grunting the while with  the exertion.    Dick soon grew tired of it however.    \"It's all very well,\" he said; \"but if that is the way we are to load  the waggons with ivory, we shall be a long time getting enough to pay  the expenses of the journey.\"    Mr Rogers joined them one day as they were walking along in advance of  the slow-moving waggon, and began to question the Zulu about the game in  the wilds north of where they were; and in his broken English he gave so  glowing an account that his hearers began to doubt its truth.    He said that when he had had to flee from his own people for his life,  he had at first gone right away into the hunting country, and stayed  there for a year, finding out, in his wanderings, places where hunting  and shooting people had never been.  Here, he declared, the wild  creatures had taken refuge as in a sanctuary; and he declared that he  should take the boss who had been so kind to his boys, and both the  young bosses, to a wild place where they would find game in abundance,  and where the forests held the great rhinoceros, plenty of elephants,  and amongst whose open glades the tall giraffe browse the leafage of the  high trees.  There in the plains were herds of buffalo too numerous to  count, quagga, zebra, gnu, eland, and bok of all kinds.  There was a  great river there, he said, full of fish, and with great crocodiles  ready to seize upon the unwary.  The hippopotamus was there too, big and  massive, ready to upset boats or to attack all he could see.    Mr Rogers watched his sons attentively as the Zulu narrated his  experience of the land, and he was delighted to see how much Dick was  already leaving off his dull languid ways, and taking an interest in  what was projected.  One thing the father wished to arrive at, and that  was whether Dick would be frightened through his weakness, and the  hunting parties consequently do him more harm than good.  But just then  a question put by his son showed him that he was as eager as his brother  for an encounter with the wild creatures of the forest and plains.    \"And do you say there are lions?\" said Dick.    \"Yes, plenty lion,\" said the Zulu.  \"They come to camp at night, and try  to get the ox and horse.\"    \"Oomph! oomph! oomph!\" growled Coffee, in an admirable imitation of the  lion's roar.    \"Keep big fire,\" said the Zulu, \"then no lion come.\"    \"Well, Dick,\" said Mr Rogers, \"how do you feel?  Ready for the fray?\"    \"Yes, father, I am longing for the time when we shall get amongst the  wild beasts.  I want to try my gun; and I want to grow strong and manly,  like Jack.\"    \"All in good time, my boy,\" replied Mr Rogers, smiling.  \"We shall soon  be leaving civilisation almost entirely behind, and then you shall make  your first attempts at becoming a mighty hunter.\"    Comparatively uninteresting as the journey was, they still had plenty to  take their attention--grand views of distant mountains; wondrous  sunsets; great flights of birds; but the absence of game was remarkable;  and twice over, in spite of their being so well armed and provided, Mr  Rogers was glad to purchase a freshly-killed springbok of a Boer, at one  of the outlying farms that they passed.    On the seventh night out though, their fortune was better, for they had  out-spanned, or loosened their oxen from the waggon, just by a clump of  trees in a wide plain, and the Zulu went off the moment they stopped.    Both Peter and Dirk began to complain, for they expected help from their  black companion; but upon this occasion they had their work to do  without aid, Coffee and Chicory having also gone off with their kiris in  search of game.    Mr Rogers and his sons started off to see if they could provide  anything palatable for supper; but though there was a swampy lagoon  about a mile away, they did not catch sight of a single duck, and were  returning tired and disappointed when they caught sight of the Zulu  signalling to them to come.    \"He has found something,\" cried Jack eagerly; and they hastened over the  rugged intervening space, to find that the father of Coffee and Chicory  was evidently a keen hunter, and ready enough in knowing where to look  for creatures that would do for food.    With almost unerring instinct he had found out this clump of trees,  evidently one where guinea-fowl came to roost; and full of hope that  they would now obtain a good addition to the larder, or, in plain  English, a few birds to roast for supper, guns were supplied with  cartridges, and the little party waited for the coming of the spotted  birds.    The pleasurable anticipations of the boys, who had a lively recollection  of the toothsome bird with a flavour half-way between roast fowl and  pheasant, seemed likely to be damped, for they had been waiting quite  half an hour without hearing or seeing anything, when suddenly the Zulu  laid his hand upon Jack's arm, and pointed in a direction opposite to  the waggon.    \"Well, what are you pointing at?\" said Jack.  \"I can't see anything.  Yes, I can; there they are, father.  Look out!\"    Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!    Half-a-dozen rapid shots, and then, amidst the whizzing of wings and  cries of the birds, some of which flew off, while others ran through the  short grass at an astounding rate, Coffee, Chicory, and their father ran  out beneath the trees; and the result of the firing was brought in--ten  fine plump birds for their supper.    This was the first night that they had passed in the open, the previous  halts having been made at some farm; so after the supper the blacks were  set to gather in more wood, the fire was well made up, and the oxen  secured, it being decided to begin at once upon the regular plan that  they would have to adopt in the enemy's country, the enemy being formed  of the various wild creatures against whom they were having their  campaign.    Years back the spot where they were encamped had been famous for lions,  but from what Mr Rogers had heard, none had been seen here now for a  considerable time.  Still he thought it better to take precautions, the  party being divided into three watches, the first of which he took  himself, with Chicory for a companion; Jack was to take the second, with  the Zulu; and Dick, Coffee, and Dinny were to form the third.    The oxen and horses having been all secured, the fire was piled up, and  those who were to rest gladly availed themselves of the opportunity, and  in a very short time nothing was to be heard but the fluttering noise  made by the burning fire, and the snorting sigh of one or the other of  the horses.    In due time Jack was aroused, to sit up and stare at his father.    \"What's matter?\" he said sleepily.    \"Nothing, only that it is your turn to watch,\" said his father.    \"Why, I've only just lain down,\" replied Jack.  \"It can't be time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#6)"],[1,"greatly, in their way of life, during that  long Indian war of forty years. They were of the hardy English, Welsh,  and Scotch-Irish stock which a generation or two in the wilderness had  toughened and strengthened. They had not yet ciphered it out that one  red hunter and trapper must waste the fifty thousand acres which  would support the families of a hundred white farmers in comfort and  prosperity; but they knew that to the westward there was a region, vast  and rich beyond anything words could say, and they longed to possess  it, with a hunger that was sometimes a pitiless greed, and always a  resistless desire. Yet it was not until the French gave up this region  that they could even venture lawlessly into it, and it was not until it  fell from Great Britain to the new power of the United States that the  borderers began openly to press into the backwoods, singly as hunters  and trappers, in families as neighborhoods as the founders of villages  and towns. The pioneers felt that they were going to take their own  wherever they found it, from the savages who could not and would not use  it, and they were right, for the land truly belongs to him who will use  it. The savages felt that the pioneers were coming to take their own  from them, for in their way they were using the land; and they were  right, too. All that is left for us to ask at this late day is which  could use the land best and most; and there can hardly be any doubt of  the answer.    [Illustration: Pioneers 049L]    To understand the situation clearly, the reader must keep in mind  certain dates. Celoron de Bienville visited the Miamis in 1749, and  the French kept the Ohio Indians on the warpath against the English  settlements to the eastward until 1763, when they gave up the West to  Great Britain. Then, until 1775, the savages alone fought the settlers  as the subjects of the English king. The Revolutionary War broke out,  and the Indians became the allies of the British. Then, in 1783, their  country was given up to the United States, and they still fought their  old enemies, who had not changed their nature by changing their name to  Americans. In 1794, the great battle of Fallen Timbers was fought on the  banks of the Maumee, and the long struggle was ended.    It had grown more and more fierce and cruel as time passed, and only  three years before General Wayne won his lasting victory, General St.  Clair had suffered his terrible defeat by the Indians. Through this  defeat, the power of the whites in the West was shaken as it had never  been before; the savages were filled with pride and hope by the greatest  triumph they had achieved over their enemies; and all the settlements in  the Northwestern Territory were endangered.    Perhaps I had better say seemed endangered. The Indians were really less  to be feared than at any time before. They were weaker, and the whites  were stronger. They were striving against destiny; and though their fate  was sealed with the blood of their enemies, their fate was sealed. All  the chances that had favored them had favored them in vain, and neither  their wily courage nor their pitiless despair availed them against the  people who outnumbered them, as the stems of the harvest field outnumber  the trees of the forest.          V. THE CAPTIVITY OF JAMES SMITH    The stories of captivity among the Ohio Indians during the war that  ended in 1794 would of themselves fill a much larger book than this is  meant to be. Most of them were never set down, but some of them were  very thrillingly told, and others very touchingly, either by the  captives themselves, or by such of their friends as were better able to  write them out. One, at least, is charming, and the narrative of  Colonel James Smith deserves a chapter by itself, not only because it is  charming, but because it shows the Indians in a truer and kindlier light  than they were often able to show themselves.    Smith was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, which in 1737 was the  frontier of the white settlement, and he was taken prisoner in 1755, by  a small party of Delawares, near Bedford, while he was helping to cut a  road for the passage of General Braddock's ill-fated expedition against  the French. The Indians hurried from the English border, and forced him  to run with them nearly the whole way to Fort Duquesne, which afterwards  became Fort Pitt, and is now Pittsburg. A large body of savages was  encamped outside the post, and there Smith expected to be burned to  death with the tortures he afterwards saw inflicted upon many other  prisoners; but he was only made to run the gantlet. Two lines of Indians  were drawn up, with sticks in their hands, and Smith dashed at the top  of his speed between their ranks. He was cruelly beaten, and before he  reached the goal he fell senseless. When he came to himself he was in  the hands of a French surgeon. He was well cared for, and he lived in  hopes of rescue by Braddock's army, which was marching against Fort  Duquesne in greater force than had ever been sent into the wilderness.  But while he was still so broken and bruised as to be scarcely able to  walk, the Indians came in with plunder and prisoners from the scene of  their bloody victory over the British troops.    A little later, Smith's captors claimed him from the French, and carried  him to an Indian town on the Muskingum. The day after their arrival a  number of the Indians came to him, and one of them began to pull out his  hair, dipping his fingers in ashes to get a better hold, and plucking it  away hair by hair till it was all gone except a lock on the crown. This  they plaited with strings of beadwork and silver brooches, and then they  bored his ears and nose and put rings in them. They painted his face  and body in different colors, hung a band of wampum about his neck, and  fitted his arm with bracelets of silver. An old chief led him into  the street of the village, and gave the alarm halloo, when all the  Delawares, Caughnewagas, and Mohicans of the place came running, and  formed round the chief, who held Smith by the hand, and made them a long  speech. He then gave Smith over to three young squaws, who pulled him  into the river waist-deep, and made signs to him that he should plunge  his head into the water. But Smith's head was full of the tortures of  the prisoners whom he had seen burnt at Fort Duquesne; he believed  all these ceremonies were the preparations for his death, and he would  neither duck.    He struggled with them, amidst the shouts and laughter of the Indians on  the shore, until one of them managed to say in English, \"No hurt you,\"  when he suffered them to plunge him under the water and rub at him as  long as they chose.    [Illustration: Indian baptism of James Smith 053]    By this means they washed away his white blood, and he was adopted into  the tribe in place of a great chief who had lately died. He seems never  to have known why this honor was done him; but he was then a lusty young  fellow of eighteen who might well have taken the fancy of some of his  captors; and he probably fell into their hands at a moment which their  superstition rendered fortunate for him.    When the squaws had done with him, he was taken up into the council  house of the village, where he was dressed in a new ruffled shirt,  leggins trimmed with ribbons and wrought with beads, and moccasins  embroidered with porcupine quills. His face was painted afresh, and his  scalp lock tied up with red feathers; he was given a pipe and tobacco  pouch and seated upon a bear skin, while one of the chiefs addressed him  in the presence of the assembled warriors. \"My son,\" so the speech was  interpreted to Smith, \"you are now flesh of our flesh and bone of our  bone. You are taken into the Caughnewaga nation, and initiated into a  warlike tribe; you are adopted into a great family... in the room and  place of a great man. After what has passed this day, you are now one  of us by an old strong law and custom. My son, you have now nothing to  fear; we are now under the same obligations to love, support, and defend  you, that we are to love and defend one another; therefore you are to  consider yourself as one of our people.\"    A grand feast of boiled venison and green corn followed, and Smith took  part in it on the same terms as all the rest of his tribe and family. In  due time he found out that no word the chief had addressed him was  idly spoken, and he began to live the life of the savages like one of  themselves, under the affectionate care and constant instruction of his  brethren. He was given a gun, at first, and sent to hunt turkeys, but he  came upon the trace of buffalo, and was lured on by the hope of larger  game, and so lost his way. The Indians found him again easily enough,  but as a punishment for his rashness his gun was taken from him, and for  two years he was allowed to carry only a bow and arrows. Once when the  hunters had killed a bear and he went out with a party to bring in the  meat, Smith complained of the weight of his load; the Indians laughed at  him, and to shame him they gave part of his burden to a young squaw  who already had as much as he to carry. At another time, he went to the  fields with some other young men to watch the squaws hoeing corn; one of  these challenged him to take her hoe, and he did so, and hoed for some  time with the women. They were delighted and praised his skill, but when  he came back to the village, the old chiefs rebuked him, telling him  that he was adopted in the place of a great man, and it was unworthy of  him to hoe corn like a squaw.    Smith owns that he never gave them a chance to chide him a second time  for such unseemly behavior. After that he left all the hard work to the  squaws like a true Indian, and guarded his dignity as a hunter. He was  never trusted, or at least he was never asked, to take part in any of  the forays against the white frontier,"]]]
