Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,  He now a full possession takes,  He who economy abhorred,  Delighted much his former ways  To vary for a few brief days.    XLVIII    For two whole days it seemed a change  To wander through the meadows still,  The cool dark oaken grove to range,  To listen to the rippling rill.  But on the third of grove and mead  He took no more the slightest heed;  They made him feel inclined to doze;  And the conviction soon arose,  Ennui can in the country dwell  Though without palaces and streets,  Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;  On him spleen mounted sentinel  And like his shadow dogged his life,  Or better,--like a faithful wife.    XLIX    I was for calm existence made,  For rural solitude and dreams,  My lyre sings sweeter in the shade  And more imagination teems.  On innocent delights I dote,  Upon my lake I love to float,  For law I _far niente_ take  And every morning I awake  The child of sloth and liberty.  I slumber much, a little read,  Of fleeting glory take no heed.  In former years thus did not I  In idleness and tranquil joy  The happiest days of life employ?    L    Love, flowers, the country, idleness  And fields my joys have ever been;  I like the difference to express  Between myself and my Eugene,  Lest the malicious reader or  Some one or other editor  Of keen sarcastic intellect  Herein my portrait should detect,  And impiously should declare,  To sketch myself that I have tried  Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,  As if impossible it were  To write of any other elf  Than one's own fascinating self.    LI    Here I remark all poets are  Love to idealize inclined;  I have dreamed many a vision fair  And the recesses of my mind  Retained the image, though short-lived,  Which afterwards the muse revived.  Thus carelessly I once portrayed  Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,  The captives of the Salguir's shore.(22)  But now a question in this wise  Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:  Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?  To whom amongst the jealous throng  Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?    [Note 22: Refers to two of the most interesting productions of  the poet. The former line indicates the _Prisoner of the  Caucasus_, the latter, _The Fountain of Baktchiserai_. The  Salguir is a river of the Crimea.]    LII    Whose glance reflecting inspiration  With tenderness hath recognized  Thy meditative incantation--  Whom hath thy strain immortalized?  None, be my witness Heaven above!  The malady of hopeless love  I have endured without respite.  Happy who thereto can unite  Poetic transport. They impart  A double force unto their song  Who following Petrarch move along  And ease the tortures of the heart--  Perchance they laurels also cull--  But I, in love, was mute and dull.    LIII    The Muse appeared, when love passed by  And my dark soul to light was brought;  Free, I renewed the idolatry  Of harmony enshrining thought.  I write, and anguish flies away,  Nor doth my absent pen portray  Around my stanzas incomplete  Young ladies' faces and their feet.  Extinguished ashes do not blaze--  I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--  Soon, of the tempest which hath fled  Time will the ravages efface--  When that time comes, a poem I'll strive  To write in cantos twenty-five.    LIV    I've thought well o'er the general plan,  The hero's name too in advance,  Meantime I'll finish whilst I can  Canto the First of this romance.  I've scanned it with a jealous eye,  Discovered much absurdity,  But will not modify a tittle--  I owe the censorship a little.  For journalistic deglutition  I yield the fruit of work severe.  Go, on the Neva's bank appear,  My very latest composition!  Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows--  Misunderstanding, words and blows.      END OF CANTO THE FIRST        CANTO THE SECOND    The Poet    \"O Rus!\"--Horace    Canto The Second    [Note: Odessa, December 1823.]    I    The village wherein yawned Eugene  Was a delightful little spot,  There friends of pure delight had been  Grateful to Heaven for their lot.  The lonely mansion-house to screen  From gales a hill behind was seen;  Before it ran a stream. Behold!  Afar, where clothed in green and gold  Meadows and cornfields are displayed,  Villages in the distance show  And herds of oxen wandering low;  Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,  A thick immense neglected grove  Extended--haunt which Dryads love.    II    'Twas built, the venerable pile,  As lordly mansions ought to be,  In solid, unpretentious style,  The style of wise antiquity.  Lofty the chambers one and all,  Silk tapestry upon the wall,  Imperial portraits hang around  And stoves of various shapes abound.  All this I know is out of date,  I cannot tell the reason why,  But Eugene, incontestably,  The matter did not agitate,  Because he yawned at the bare view  Of drawing-rooms or old or new.    III    He took the room wherein the old  Man--forty years long in this wise--  His housekeeper was wont to scold,  Look through the window and kill flies.  'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,  Two cupboards, table, soft divan,  And not a speck of dirt descried.  Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.  In one he doth accounts behold,  Here bottles stand in close array,  There jars of cider block the way,  An almanac but eight years old.  His uncle, busy man indeed,  No other book had time to read.    IV    Alone amid possessions great,  Eugene at first began to dream,  If but to lighten Time's dull rate,  Of many an economic scheme;  This anchorite amid his waste  The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced  By an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:(23)  The peasant blessed his happy fate.  But this a heinous crime appeared  Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,  Who secretly denounced the gift,  And many another slily sneered;  And all with one accord agreed,  He was a dangerous fool indeed.    [Note 23: The _barshtchina_ was the corvee, or forced labour  of three days per week rendered previous to the emancipation  of 1861 by the serfs to their lord.    The _obrok_ was a species of poll-tax paid by a serf, either  in lieu of the forced labour or in consideration of being  permitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very  heavy obroks have at times been levied on serfs possessed of  skill or accomplishments, or who had amassed wealth; and  circumstances may be easily imagined which, under such a  system, might lead to great abuses.]    V    All visited him at first, of course;  But since to the backdoor they led  Most usually a Cossack horse  Upon the Don's broad pastures bred  If they but heard domestic loads  Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,  Most by this circumstance offended  All overtures of friendship ended.  \"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!  He's a freemason, so we think.  Alone he doth his claret drink,  A lady's hand doth never kiss.  'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_\"(24)  This was his social character.    [Note 24: The neighbours complained of Oneguine's want of courtesy.  He always replied \"da\" or \"nyet,\" yes or no, instead of \"das\"  or \"nyets\"--the final s being a contraction of \"sudar\" or  \"sudarinia,\" i.e. sir or madam.]    VI    Into the district then to boot  A new proprietor arrived,  From whose analysis minute  The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.  Vladimir Lenski was his name,  From Gottingen inspired he came,  A worshipper of Kant, a bard,  A young and handsome galliard.  He brought from mystic Germany  The fruits of learning and combined  A fiery and eccentric mind,  Idolatry of liberty,  A wild enthusiastic tongue,  Black curls which to his shoulders hung.    VII    The pervert world with icy chill  Had not yet withered his young breast.  His heart reciprocated still  When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.  He was a dear delightful fool--  A nursling yet for Hope to school.  The riot of the world and glare  Still sovereigns of his spirit were,  And by a sweet delusion he  Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,  He deemed of human life the goal  To be a charming mystery:  He racked his brains to find its clue  And marvels deemed he thus should view.    VIII    This he believed: a kindred spirit  Impelled to union with his own  Lay languishing both day and night--  Waiting his coming--his alone!  He deemed his friends but longed to make  Great sacrifices for his sake!  That a friend's arm in every case  Felled a calumniator base!  That chosen heroes consecrate,  Friends of the sons of every land,  Exist--that their immortal band  Shall surely, be it soon or late,  Pour on this orb a dazzling light  And bless mankind with full delight.    IX    Compassion now or wrath inspires  And now philanthropy his soul,  And now his youthful heart desires  The path which leads to glory's goal.  His harp beneath that sky had rung  Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,  And at the altar of their fame  He kindled his poetic flame.  But from the Muses' loftiest height  The gifted songster never swerved,  But proudly in his song preserved  An ever transcendental flight;  His transports were quite maidenly,  Charming with grave simplicity.    X    He sang of love--to love a slave.  His ditties were as pure and bright  As thoughts which gentle maidens have,  As a babe's slumber, or the light  Of the moon in the tranquil skies,  Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.  He sang of separation grim,  Of what not, and of distant dim,  Of roses to romancers dear;  To foreign lands he would allude,  Where long time he in solitude  Had let fall many a bitter tear:  He sang of life's fresh colours stained  Before he eighteen years attained.    XI    Since Eugene in that solitude  Gifts such as these alone could prize,  A scant attendance Lenski showed  At neighbouring hospitalities.  He shunned those parties boisterous;  The conversation tedious  About the crop of hay, the wine,  The kennel or a kindred line,  Was certainly not erudite  Nor sparkled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2400"],[0,"Vikram and the Vampire: Classic Hindu Tales of Adventure, Magic, and Romance (#6)"],[1,"oilman's son, has  suspended him head downwards from a mimosa tree in a cemetery. He is now  anxiously plotting thy destruction. He hath murdered his own child--\"    \"And how came an anchorite to have a child?\" asked Raja Vikram,  incredulously.    \"That is what I am about to tell thee,\" replied the giant. \"In the good  days of thy generous father, Gandharba-Sena, as the court was taking its  pleasure in the forest, they saw a devotee, or rather a devotee's head,  protruding from a hole in the ground. The white ants had surrounded his  body with a case of earth, and had made their home upon his skin. All  kinds of insects and small animals crawled up and down the face, yet not  a muscle moved. Wasps had hung their nests to its temples, and scorpions  wandered in and out of the matted and clotted hair; yet the hermit felt  them not. He spoke to no one; he received no gifts; and had it not been  for the opening of his nostrils, as he continually inhaled the pungent  smoke of a thorn fire, man would have deemed him dead. Such were his  religious austerities.    \"Thy father marvelled much at the sight, and rode home in profound  thought. That evening, as he sat in the hall of audience, he could speak  of nothing but the devotee; and his curiosity soon rose to such a pitch,  that he proclaimed about the city a reward of one hundred gold pieces to  any one that could bring to court this anchorite of his own free will.    \"Shortly afterwards, Vasantasena, a singing and dancing girl more  celebrated for wit and beauty than for sagesse or discretion, appeared  before thy sire, and offered for the petty inducement of a gold bangle  to bring the anchorite into the palace, carrying a baby on his shoulder.    \"The king hearing her speak was astonished, gave her a betel leaf in  token that he held her to her promise, and permitted her to depart,  which she did with a laugh of triumph.    \"Vasantasena went directly to the jungle, where she found the pious man  faint with thirst, shriveled with hunger, and half dead with heat  and cold. She cautiously put out the fire. Then, having prepared a  confection, she approached from behind and rubbed upon his lips a little  of the sweetmeat, which he licked up with great relish. Thereupon she  made more and gave it to him. After two days of this generous diet he  gained some strength, and on the third, as he felt a finger upon his  mouth, he opened his eyes and said, 'Why hast thou come here?'    \"The girl, who had her story in readiness, replied: \"I am the daughter  of a deity, and have practiced religious observances in the heavenly  regions. I have now come into this forest!\" And the devotee, who began  to think how much more pleasant is such society than solitude, asked her  where her hut was, and requested to be led there.    \"Then Vasantasena, having unearthed the holy man and compelled him to  purify himself, led him to the abode which she had caused to be built  for herself in the wood. She explained its luxuries by the nature of  her vow, which bound her to indulge in costly apparel, in food with six  flavours, and in every kind of indulgence.[30] In course of time the  hermit learned to follow her example; he gave up inhaling smoke, and he  began to eat and drink as a daily occupation.    \"At length Kama began to trouble him. Briefly the saint and saintess  were made man and wife, by the simple form of matrimony called the  Gandharba-vivaha,[31] and about ten months afterwards a son was born to  them. Thus the anchorite came to have a child.    \"Remained Vasantasena's last feat. Some months passed: then she said  to the devotee her husband, 'Oh saint! let us now, having finished our  devotions, perform a pilgrimage to some sacred place, that all the sins  of our bodies may be washed away, after which we will die and depart  into everlasting happiness.' Cajoled by these speeches, the hermit  mounted his child upon his shoulder and followed her where she  went--directly into Raja Gandharba-Sena's palace.    \"When the king and the ministers and the officers and the courtiers saw  Vasantasena, and her spouse carrying the baby, they recognized her from  afar. The Raja exclaimed, 'Lo! this is the very singing girl who went  forth to bring back the devotee. 'And all replied: 'O great monarch!  thou speakest truly; this is the very same woman. And be pleased to  observe that whatever things she, having asked leave to undertake, went  forth to do, all these she hath done!' Then gathering around her they  asked her all manner of questions, as if the whole matter had been the  lightest and the most laughable thing in the world.    \"But the anchorite, having heard the speeches of the king and his  courtiers, thought to himself, 'They have done this for the purpose of  taking away the fruits of my penance.' Cursing them all with terrible  curses, and taking up his child, he left the hall. Thence he went to the  forest, slaughtered the innocent, and began to practice austerities with  a view to revenge that hour, and having slain his child, he will attempt  thy life. His prayers have been heard. In the first place they deprived  thee of thy father. Secondly, they cast enmity between thee and thy  brother, thus dooming him to an untimely end. Thirdly, they are now  working thy ruin. The anchorite's design is to offer up a king and a  king's son to his patroness Durga, and by virtue of such devotional act  he will obtain the sovereignty of the whole world!    \"But I have promised, O Vikram, to save thee, if such be the will of  Fortune, from impending destruction. Therefore hearken well unto my  words. Distrust them that dwell amongst the dead, and remember that  it is lawful and right to strike off his head that would slay thee. So  shalt thou rule the universal earth, and leave behind thee an immortal  name!\"    Suddenly Prithwi Pala, the giant, ceased speaking, and disappeared.  Vikram and his son then passed through the city gates, feeling their  limbs to be certain that no bones were broken, and thinking over the  scene that had occurred.          *     *     *     *     *     *    We now are informed how the valiant King Vikram met with the Vampire.    It was the spring season when the Raja returned, and the Holi  festival[32] caused dancing and singing in every house. Ujjayani was  extraordinarily happy and joyful at the return of her ruler, who joined  in her gladness with all his kingly heart. The faces and dresses of  the public were red and yellow with gulal and abir,--perfumed  powders,[33]--which were sprinkled upon one another in token of  merriment. Musicians deafened the citizens' ears, dancing girls  performed till ready to faint with fatigue, the manufacturers of  comfits made their fortunes, and the Nine Gems of Science celebrated the  auspicious day with the most long-winded odes. The royal hero, decked  in regal attire, and attended by many thousands of state palanquins  glittering with their various ornaments, and escorted by a suite of a  hundred kingly personages, with their martial array of the four hosts,  of cavalry, elephants, chariots, and infantry, and accompanied by Amazon  girls, lovely as the suite of the gods, himself a personification of  majesty, bearing the white parasol of dominion, with a golden staff and  tassels, began once more to reign.    After the first pleasures of return, the king applied himself  unremittingly to good government and to eradicating the abuses which had  crept into the administration during the period of his wanderings.    Mindful of the wise saying, \"if the Rajadid not punish the guilty, the  stronger would roast the weaker like a fish on the spit,\" he began  the work of reform with an iron hand. He confiscated the property of  a councillor who had the reputation of taking bribes; he branded the  forehead of a sudra or servile man whose breath smelt of ardent spirits,  and a goldsmith having been detected in fraud he ordered him to be cut  in shreds with razors as the law in its mercy directs. In the case of a  notorious evil-speaker he opened the back of his head and had his tongue  drawn through the wound. A few murderers he burned alive on iron beds,  praying the while that Vishnu might have mercy upon their souls. His  spies were ordered, as the shastra called \"The Prince\" advises, to mix  with robbers and thieves with a view of leading them into situations  where they might most easily be entrapped, and once or twice when the  fellows were too wary, he seized them and their relations and impaled  them all, thereby conclusively proving, without any mistake, that he was  king of earth.    With the sex feminine he was equally severe. A woman convicted of having  poisoned an elderly husband in order to marry a younger man was thrown  to the dogs, which speedily devoured her. He punished simple infidelity  by cutting off the offender's nose--an admirable practice, which is not  only a severe penalty to the culprit, but also a standing warning to  others, and an efficient preventative to any recurrence of the fault.  Faithlessness combined with bad example or brazen-facedness was further  treated by being led in solemn procession through the bazar mounted on  a diminutive and crop-eared donkey, with the face turned towards the  crupper. After a few such examples the women of Ujjayani became almost  modest; it is the fault of man when they are not tolerably well behaved  in one point at least.    Every day as Vikram sat upon the judgment-seat, trying causes and  punishing offenses, he narrowly observed the speech, the gestures,  and the countenances of the various criminals and litigants and their  witnesses. Ever suspecting women, as I have said, and holding them to  be the root of all evil, he never failed when some sin or crime more  horrible than usual came before him, to ask the accused, \"Who is she?\"  and the suddenness of the question often elicited the truth by accident.  For there can be nothing thoroughly and"]]]
