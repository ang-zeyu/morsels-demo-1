Jesus fathomed the deep meaning  of the religion of his people, and its original fitness to become,  through higher development, the religion of the world. Jesus devoted  himself to the end of forming the human race into one great society (the  kingdom of heaven), of which religion should be the soul and life, and,  convinced of his calling, proclaimed himself as the Son of man, who, as  such, belonged not to Israel alone, but to mankind. Jesus combated both  the formalism and exclusiveness of the Pharisees, and the unbelief of  the Sadducees, and with word and deed preached a religion which,  independent of all outward form, took hold of the human heart, and  which, developing into an independent principle in man, was to find its  commission, not in the authority of Scripture or tradition, not even in  that of his name, but in its own power and truth. In him religion  appeared as the power of self-sacrificing love, which fears not even  death, and to which dying is not the losing of life, but the development  of life. In distinction from other religions, in which either God and  man are strangers to each other, and opposed to each other, or man's  personality is, as it were, sunk in God, Christianity is the religion by  which man, in the full enjoyment of individual development, and with the  sense of his own strength, lives in the consciousness of the most entire  dependence upon God. Religion in its highest form, conceived as the  oneness of man with God, is realized in Christianity.[53]      4. ISLAMISM.    The religion of the ancient nomadic tribes of the Arabian peninsula  originally exhibited a polytheistical character, in the form of the  worship, in part of sacred stones, in part of the powers of nature,  especially of the stars, whose position and motion were thought to exert  an influence, beneficent or baneful, upon the destinies of men. With  these conceptions was combined a certain leaning toward monotheism,  which manifested itself especially in the common worship of Allah taala  (equivalent to El Eljon), which was afterwards quickened and  strengthened by association with the Jewish tribes, with whom they held  themselves to be related by descent from Abraham. The Parsee doctrine of  demons, also, was not unknown in Arabia, after the conquest of the  Persians in the fifth century. After the third, fourth, and fifth  centuries, Christianity also, though in a corrupt form, or, definitely,  in the form of Monophysitism and Nestorianism, which had been condemned  by the church, became established in Arabia.    Amid such diverse elements, there was need of unity in the domain of  religion, a need for which Mohammed, after the example of others of his  family, sought to provide.    He was born at Mecca (571) of an honorable family, belonging to the  Koreish tribe. Finding no satisfaction for his restless spirit in the  trade to which after his parents' death he had at first devoted himself,  he gave himself up, in solitary retirement, to quiet meditation, and  became more and more convinced of his calling to put an end, by means of  a better religion, to the confusion existing among his countrymen with  regard to religion. The religious idea which overmastered him presented  itself to his powerful Oriental imagination in the form of a vision as a  revelation of Allah taala, made to him in the fortieth year of his life  by mediation of the angel Gabriel. His conviction, thus acquired, was  confirmed by revelations afterwards received; and, shared at first with  a small circle of trusted friends, gradually spread wider, until at last  Mohammed came forward in the ancient sanctuary, the Kaaba, at Mecca, as  prophet of Allah. For this he was pursued by his countrymen, and fled  from thence to Medina, in the year 622, the beginning of the Moslem era.  The number of his followers increasing, he had recourse to arms. He  conquered Mecca in 630, and made the Kaaba, after destroying the idols  in it, the sanctuary of the new religion.    The doctrine of Mohammed (Islam, submission to God, whence his followers  take the name of Moslems), is contained in the Koran. The various  Suras, or divisions, originally the revelations received by the prophet  at different periods of his life reduced to writing, were, soon after  his death, united by Abu Bekr into one holy book, under the name of the  Koran (al Kitab, the book), which, like the Bible among the later Jews  and Christians, was clothed with divine authority. The central doctrine  of Mohammed is the belief in one God, Allah, who, as the Creator and  Lord of all things, in strictest isolation from the world, is throned in  heaven. All that takes place upon the earth befalls according to the  eternal decree of God, a conception in which, at least among the  Orthodox Moslems, the Sunnites, who are distinguished in this respect,  as in others, from the dissenting Shiites, there is no place left for  human freedom. This God has from the earliest times revealed himself to  some privileged men, Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus (Isa). To the  last is due the honor of having been the reformer of degenerate Judaism.  He is not, as the Christians of Mohammed's time taught, the Son of God  in a metaphysical sense, much less God himself,--Allah is one, he  neither begets nor is begotten,--but a prophet of human descent. The  greatest and last prophet is Mohammed himself, in whom prophetism  reached its fulfillment. Along with the doctrine regarding God and his  relation to the world, prayer, hospitality, and benevolence occupy a  prominent place in the teaching of Mohammed, looked at from its  practical side, and also the belief in a future life, in the  Jewish-Parsee form of the resurrection of the dead, the judgment of the  world, future reward and punishment, paradise and hell. The truth of  this divine revelation rests upon the very fact of its having been  revealed, and, according to Mohammed, it no more needs scientific proof  than confirmation by miracles, to which Islamism did not appeal until  later.    The opinion which formerly prevailed among Christians that Mohammed was  an impostor, a false prophet, was bound up with the conception that God,  to the exclusion of other nations, had revealed himself immediately and  supernaturally first to Israel, and afterwards through Christ to all  mankind. Hence it followed that Christianity was not prized as the  highest religion, existing along with less developed forms of religion,  but was opposed as the only true religion to all others, which were  regarded as the fruit of imposture and error, an opinion to which the  religious and political struggles in which Islam and Christendom have  been involved also richly contributed. Mohammed was seer and prophet,  filled with fiery zeal for religion, and, while he stands indeed in this  respect, both personally and with regard to the contents of his  preaching and the means by which he sought to gain admission for his  doctrine, below the seers of Israel, and far below the founder of  Christianity, yet, on the other hand, his monotheism, abstract as it is,  must be regarded as a wholesome reaction against the ever-increasing  polytheistical superstition to which in his time the Christian church of  the East especially had sunk. Islamism stands, however, below original  Christianity, the religion of Jesus and the Apostles, in that, by  separating God, as the abstract one Supreme Being, from the world, it  leaves no place for the doctrine of God's immanence, or the indwelling  of the Spirit of God in man. Hence in Islamism the divine revelation  remains purely mechanical, with no natural point of connection in man,  and therefore there is no possibility of an enduring prophetism, which  is the fundamental principle of Christianity. From this separation of  God and man, the Mohammedan doctrine of predestination, in distinction  from the Christian, acquires its abstract and fatalistic character,  whereby man, instead of being regarded as a being in whose free activity  God's power and life are glorified, is conceived as a passive instrument  of a higher power. To true moral independence, therefore, the Moslem  does not attain. His religion is legal and external, and therefore  intolerant and exclusive; and when Islamism, led by excited passion and  a heated imagination, disregarded the sanctity of marriage, and held up  as a reward before the faithful Moslem a paradise characterized by  sensual enjoyment, it missed at once the deep moral and spiritual  character of Christianity. To these defects must be ascribed the fact  that Islamism, adapted to the need of the East, and therefore spread  over a large part of Asia and Africa, has not, with the exception of the  empire of Turkey, and for a time also of Spain, penetrated Europe; and,  overshadowed by a higher development of humanity, has reached its  highest bloom, while Christianity, brought back to its original purity,  remains the religion of the civilized world.

This seems to me insufficient           reason for assuming that [Greek: archaios neôs] means sometimes           one temple and sometimes another.]             [Footnote 19: _Mitth._, xv, p. 427 ff.]             [Footnote 20: LOLLING (p. 644) thinks the expression [Greek: en           tô neô tô Ecatompedô] could not be used of a part of a building           of which [Greek: proneôs] and [Greek: Parthenôn] were parts,           _i.e._, that a part of a temple could not be called [Greek:           neôs]. Yet in the inscription published by Lolling the [Greek:           proneion] and the [Greek: neôs] are mentioned in apparent           contradistinction to [Greek: apan to Ecatompedon]. It seems, as           Dörpfeld says, only natural that the [Greek: neôs] should belong           to the same building as the [Greek: proneôs].]             Among the objects mentioned in the lists of treasure handed           over by one board of [Greek: tamiai] to the next           (_Ueberyab-Urkunden_ or \"transmission-lists\") are parts of a           statue of Athena with a base and a [Greek Nike] and a shield           [Greek: en tô Ekatompedô]. The material of this statue is gold           and ivory. The only gold and ivory statue of Athena on the           Acropolis was, so far as is known, the so-called _Parthenos_ of           Pheidias. Those inscriptions therefore prove that the Parthenos           stood in the Hekatompedos (or Hekatompedon); that is, that the           eastern cella of the Parthenon was called [Greek: Ecatompedos           (ov)] in the fifth century.[21] Certainly, if there had been a           second chryselephantine statue of Athena on the Acropolis, we           should know of its existence.             [Footnote 21: This was shown by U. KÖHLER. _Mitth_., v, p. 89           ff., and again by DÖRPFELD, xv, 480 ff, who quote the           inscriptions. LOLLING'S distinction between [Greek: to agalma]           and [Greek: to chrusoun agalma] cannot be maintained. _cf. U.           Köhler, Sitzungsber, d. Berlin. Akad._, 1889, p. 223.]             When the Athenians built the great western room of the           Parthenon, they certainly did not intend it to serve merely as           a store-room for the objects described in the           transmission-lists as [Greek: en tô Parthenôn] or [ek tou           Parthenônos], these being mostly of little value or broken.[22]           Now the treasury of Athens was the opisthodomos, and the western           room of the Parthenon was, from the moment of the completion of           the  building, the greatest opisthodomos in Athens. It is  Page 11  natural to regard this (with Lolling) as the opisthodomos where           the treasure was kept. This room was doubtless divided into           three parts by two partitions of some sort, probably of           metal,[23] running from the eastern and western wall to the           nearest columns and connecting the columns. This arrangement           agrees with the provision (_CIA_, I, 32) that the monies of           Athena be cared for [Greek: en tô dexi tou opisthodomou], those           of the other gods [Greek: en tô ep dexeia tou opisthodomou].           Until the completion of the Parthenon, the opisthodomos of the           pre-Persian temple might properly be _the_ opisthodomos [Greek:           cat exochen], but so soon as the Parthenon was finished, the new           treasure-house would naturally usurp the name as well as the           functions of its predecessor.             [Footnote 22: A general view of these transmission-lists may be           found at the back of MICHAELIS' _der Parthenon_: See also H.           LEHNER, _Ueber die attischen Schatzverzeichnisse des vierten           Jahrhunderts_ (which Lolling cites. I have not seen it.)]             [Footnote 23: See plans of the Parthenon, for instance, the one           in the plan of the Acropolis accompanying Dörpfeld's article,           _Mitth._, XII, _Taf. 1_.]             But, if the western room of the Periclean temple was the           opisthodomos, where was the [Greek: Parthenôn] proper? It cannot           be identical with the [Greek: neôs o Ecatompedos] nor with the           opisthodomos, for the three appellations occur at the same date           evidently designating three different places. It would be           easier to tell where the [Greek: Parthenôn] proper was, if we           knew why it was called [Greek: Parthenôn]. The name was in all           probability not derived from the Parthenos, but rather the           statue was named from the _Parthenon_ after the latter           appellation had been extended to the whole building, for there           is no evidence that the great statue was called Parthenos from           the first. Its official title was, so far as is known, never           Parthenos.[24] The Parthenon was not so named because it           contained the Parthenos, but why it was so named we do not know.           The [Greek: proneôs] is certainly the front porch, the [Greek:           Ecatompedos neôs] is certainly the cella, 100 feet long, the           [Greek: opisthodomos] is the rear apartment of some building,           (even if I have not made it seem probable that it is the rear           apartment of the Parthenon). These names carry their explanation           with them. But the name [Greek: Parthenôn] gives us no           information. It was a part of the great Periclean temple, for           the name was in later times applied to the whole building, and           the only part of the building not named is the western porch. It  Page 12  is, however, incredible that the Athenians should use this           porch, so prominently exposed to the eyes of every sight-seer,           as a storehouse for festival apparatus, _etc_. It is more           probable that the [Greek: Parthenôn] proper was within the walls           of the building but separated from the other parts in some way.           The middle division of the western room, separated by columns           and metal partitions from the treasury of Athena on the right           and that of the other gods on the left, was large enough and,           being directly in front of the western door, prominent enough,           to deserve a name of its own. If this room was the [Greek:           Parthenôn] proper, it is evident that a fire in the opisthodomos           would cause the [Greek: Parthenôn] to be emptied of its           contents, which would then naturally be inventoried as [Greek:           ek tou Parthenônos], while another list could properly be headed           [Greek: ek tou opisthodomon] referring to the           treasure-chambers.[25] The name Parthenon might then be extended           first to the entire western part of the building and then to the           whole edifice. This is not a _proof_ that the [Greek: Parthenôn]           was the central part of the western room of the great temple. A           complete proof is impossible. All I claim is that this           hypothesis fulfils all the necessary conditions.             [Footnote 24: DÖRPFELD, XV, p. 480.]             [Footnote 25: DÖRPFELD, XII, p. 203 f., argues that these           headings show that the treasure was moved after the fire of 406           from the opisthodomos of the old temple into the [Greek:           Parthenôn] proper, which was emptied of its contents to make           room. But the explanation given above seems equally possible.           Dörpfeld, (Mitth., vi, p. 283, ff.) proved conclusively that the           [Greek: Parthenôn] was not the eastern cella of the Parthenon.           His proof that it was the great western room is based primarily           upon the assumption (p. 300) that _Der Name Opisthodom           bezeichnet hei alien Tempeln die dem Pronaos entsprechende           Hinterhalle_. But for that assumption the [Greek: Parthenôn]           might just as well be the western porch. Since the discovery of           the pre-Persian temple, however, Dörpfeld maintains that the           opisthodomos [Greek: kat exochen] was the entire western portion           of that temple, consisting of three rooms besides the porch           (though he does not expressly include the porch). There is,           then, no reason in the nature of things why the whole western           part of the Parthenon should not be called opisthodomos.]             Let us now compare the nomenclature of the pre-Persian and           Periclean temples. Both were temples of Athena and more           especially of Athena as guardian of the city, Athena Polias; a           _pronaos_ or _proneion_ formed part of each; one temple was           called [Greek: to Ecatomedon], and the main cella of the other           was called [Greek: o Ecatompedos][26], and this name was           extended to the whole building. An opisthodomos was a part of  Page 13  each building, and, if I was right in my observations above, the           new one, like the old, was called simply [Greek: o           opisthodomos]. As soon as the great Periclean temple was           completed, the temple burnt by the Persians was quietly removed           as had been intended from the first, the treasure was deposited           in the great new opisthodomos, the old ceremonies which might           still cling to the temple of the sixth century were transferred,           along with the old names, to the splendid new building; the           greatest temple on the Acropolis was now"]]]
