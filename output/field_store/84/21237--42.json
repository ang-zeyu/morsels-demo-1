[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#6)"],[1," platform with much grave interest. The moment it was completed, he  trotted down it on a tour of investigation. At its lower edge he  slipped and rolled into the pool. There he floundered, with no thought  at all of climbing out as he had got in, until the Master rescued him  and spread a wire net over the whole pool to avert future accidents.    Thenceforth, Bruce met with no worse mischance, there, than the  perpetual catching of his toe-pads in the meshes of the wire. Thus  ensnared he would stand, howling most lamentably, until his yells  brought rescue.    Though the pool could be covered with a net, the wide lake at the foot  of the lawn could not be. Into the lake Bruce would wade till the water  reached his shoulders. Then with a squeal of venturesome joy, he would  launch himself outward for a swim; and, once facing away from shore, he  never had sense enough to turn around.    After a half-hour of steady swimming, his soft young strength would  collapse. A howl of terror would apprise the world at large that he was  about to drown. Whereat some passing boatman would pick him up and hold  him for ransom, or else some one from The Place must jump into skiff or  canoe and hie with all speed to the rescue. The same thing would be  repeated day after day.    The local S.P.C.A. threatened to bring action against the Master for  letting his dog risk death, in this way, from drowning. Morbidly, the  Master wished the risk might verge into a certainty.    The puppy's ravenous appetite was the wonder of all. He stopped eating  only when there was nothing edible in reach. And as his ideas of edible  food embraced everything that was chewable,--from bath-towels to  axle-grease--he was seldom fasting and was frequently ill.    Nature does more for animals than for humans. By a single experience  she warns them, as a rule, what they may safely eat and what they may  not. Bruce was the exception. He would pounce upon and devour a  luscious bit of laundry-soap with just as much relish as though a  similar bit of soap had not made him horribly sick the day before.    Once he munched, relishfully, a two-pound box of starch, box and all;  on his recovery, he began upon a second box, and was unhappy when it  was taken from him.    He would greet members of the family with falsetto-thunderous barks of  challenge as they came down the drive from the highway. But he would  frisk out in joyous welcome to meet and fawn upon tramps or peddlers  who sought to invade The Place. He could scarce learn his own name. He  could hardly be taught to obey the simplest command. As for shaking  hands or lying down at order (those two earliest bits of any dog's  education), they meant no more to Bruce than did the theory of  quadratic equations.    At three months he launched forth merrily as a chicken-killer;  gleefully running down and beheading The Place's biggest Orpington  rooster. But his first kill was his last. The Master saw to that.    There is no use in thrashing a dog for killing poultry. There is but  one practically sure cure for the habit. And this one cure the Master  applied.    He tied the slain rooster firmly around Bruce's furry throat, and made  the puppy wear it, as a heavy and increasingly malodorous pendant, for  three warm days and nights.    Before the end of this seventy-two-hour period, Bruce had grown to  loathe the sight and scent of chicken. Stupid as he was, he learned  this lesson with absolute thoroughness,--as will almost any  chicken-killing pup,--and it seemed to be the only teaching that his  unawakened young brain had the power to grasp.    In looks, too, Bruce was a failure. His yellowish-and-white body was  all but shapeless. His coat was thick and heavy enough, but it showed a  tendency to curl--almost to kink--instead of waving crisply, as a  collie's ought. The head was coarse and blurred in line. The body was  gaunt, in spite of its incessant feedings. As for contour or style--    It was when the Master, in disgust, pointed out these diverse failings  of the pup, that the Mistress was wont to draw on historic precedent  for other instances of slow development, and to take in vain the names  of Thackeray, Lincoln, Washington and Bismarck and the rest.    \"Give him time!\" she urged once. \"He isn't quite six months old yet;  and he has grown so terribly fast. Why, he's over two feet tall, at the  shoulder, even now--much bigger than most full-grown collies. Champion  Howgill Rival is spoken of as a 'big' dog; yet he is only twenty-four  inches at the shoulder, Mr. Leighton says. Surely it's something to own  a dog that is so big.\"    \"It IS 'something,'\" gloomily conceded the Master. \"In our case it is a  catastrophe. I don't set up to be an expert judge of collies, so maybe  I am all wrong about him. I'm going to get professional opinion,  though. Next week they are going to have the spring dogshow at Hampton.  It's a little hole-in-a-corner show, of course. But Symonds is to be  the all-around judge, except for the toy breeds. And Symonds knows  collies, from the ground up. I am going to take Bruce over there and  enter him for the puppy class. If he is any good, Symonds will know it.  If the dog is as worthless as I think he is, I'll get rid of him. If  Symonds gives any hope for him, I'll keep him on a while longer.\"    \"But,\" ventured the Mistress, \"if Symonds says 'Thumbs down,' then--\"    \"Then I'll buy a pet armadillo or an ornithorhynchus instead,\"  threatened the Master. \"Either of them will look more like a collie  than Bruce does.\"    \"I--I wonder if Mr. Symonds smokes,\" mused the Mistress under her  breath.    \"Smokes?\" echoed the Master. \"What's that got to do with it?\"    \"I was only wondering,\" she made hesitant answer, \"if a box of very  wonderful cigars, sent to him with our cards, mightn't perhaps--\"    \"It's a fine sportsmanly proposition!\" laughed the Master. \"When women  get to ruling the world of sport, there'll be no need of comic  cartoons. Genuine photographs will do as well. If it's just the same to  you, dear girl, we'll let Symonds buy his own cigars, for the present.  The dog-show game is almost the only one I know of where a judge is  practically always on the square. People doubt his judgment, sometimes,  but there is practically never any doubt of his honesty. Besides, we  want to get the exact dope on Bruce. (Not that I haven't got it,  already!) If Symonds 'gates' him, I'm going to offer him for sale at  the show. If nobody buys him there, I'm going--\"    \"He hasn't been 'gated' yet,\" answered the Mistress in calm confidence.    At the little spring show, at Hampton, a meager eighty dogs were  exhibited, of which only nine were collies. This collie division  contained no specimens to startle the dog-world. Most of the exhibits  were pets. And like nearly all pets, they were \"seconds\"--in other  words, the less desirable dogs of thoroughbred litters.    Hampton's town hall auditorium was filled to overcrowding, with a mass  of visitors who paraded interestedly along the aisles between the  raised rows of stall-like benches where the dogs were tied; or who  grouped densely around all four sides of the roped judging-ring in the  center of the hall.    For a dogshow has a wel-nigh universal appeal to humanity at large;  even as the love for dogs is one of the primal and firm-rooted human  emotions. Not only the actual exhibitor and their countless friends  flock to such shows; but the public at large is drawn thither as to no  other function of the kind.    Horse-racing, it is true, brings out a crowd many times larger than  does a dogshow. But only because of the thrill of winning or losing  money. For where one's spare cash is, there is his heart and his  all-absorbing interest. Yet it is a matter of record that grass is  growing high, on the race-tracks, in such states as have been able to  enforce the anti-betting laws. The \"sport of kings\" flourishes only  where wagers may accompany it. Remove the betting element, and you turn  your racetrack into a huge and untrodden lot.    There is practically no betting connected with any dogshow. People go  there to see the dogs and to watch their judging, and for nothing else.  As a rule, the show is not even a social event. Nevertheless, the  average dogshow is thronged with spectators. (Try to cross Madison  Square Garden, on Washington's Birthday afternoon, while the  Westminster Kennel Club's Show is in progress. If you can work your way  through the press of visitors in less than half an hour, then Nature  intended you for a football champion.)    The fortunate absence of a betting-interest alone keeps such affairs  from becoming among the foremost sporting features of the world. Many  of the dogs on view are fools, of course. Because many of them have  been bred solely with a view to show-points. And their owners and  handlers have done nothing to awaken in their exhibits the half-human  brain and heart that is a dog's heritage. All has been sacrificed to  \"points\"--to points which are arbitrary and which change as freakily as  do fashions in dress.    For example, a few years ago, a financial giant collected and exhibited  one of the finest bunches of collies on earth. He had a competent  manager and an army of kennel-men to handle them. He took inordinate  pride in these priceless collies of his. Once I watched him, at the  Garden Show, displaying them to some Wall Street friends. Three times  he made errors in naming his dogs. Once, when he leaned too close to  the star collie of his kennels, the dog mistook him for a stranger and  resented the intrusion by snapping at him. He did not know his own  pets, one from another. And they did not know their owner, by sight or  by scent.    At the small shows, there is an atmosphere wholly different. Few of the  big breeders bother to compete at such contests. The dogs are for the  most part pets, for which their owners feel a keen personal affection,  and which have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#6)"],[1,"it.    But, next morning, there was quite another phase of life awaiting him.  Like most Great Moments, this exploit of Lad's was not on the free  list. And Trouble set in;--grim and sinister trouble.    Breakfast was over. The Mistress and the Master were taking their  wonted morning stroll through the grounds. Lad cantered along, ahead of  them. The light bullet-scratch on his foreleg did not lame or annoy  him. He inspected everything of canine interest; sniffing expert  inquiry at holes which might prove to be rabbit warrens; glaring in  truculent threat up some tree which might or might not harbor an  impudent squirrel; affecting to see objects of mysterious import in  bush clumps; crouching in dramatic threat at a fat stag-beetle which  scuttled across his path.    There are an immense number of worth-while details for a very young  collie, in even the most casual morning walk; especially if his  Mistress and his Master chance to be under his escort. And Laddie  neglected none of these things. If a troop of bears or a band of  Indians or a man-eating elephant were lurking anywhere in the shrubbery  or behind tree-trunks, Lad was not going to fail in discovering and  routing out such possible dangers to the peace of mind of his two  adored deities.    Scent and sight presently were attracted by a feeble fluttering under a  low-limbed catalpa tree in whose branches a pair of hysterical robins  were screeching. Lad paused, his tulip ears at attention, his plumed  tail swaying. Then he pushed his long muzzle through a clump of grass  and emerged carrying a flapping and piping morsel between his mighty  jaws. The birds, on the limb above, redoubled their frenzied chirping;  and made little futile dashes at the collie's head.    Unheeding, Lad walked back to the Mistress and laid gently at her feet  the baby robin he had found. His keen teeth had not so much as ruffled  its pinfeather plumage. Having done his share toward settling the  bird's dilemma, Laddie stood back and watched in grave interest while  the Mistress lifted the fluttering infant and put it back in the nest  whence it had fallen.    \"That makes the fifth baby bird Laddie has brought to me in a month,\"  she commented, as she and the Master turned back toward the house. \"To  say nothing of two field mice and a broken-winged bat. He seems to  think I'll know what to do for them.\"    \"I only hope he won't happen upon a newborn rattlesnake or copperhead  and bring it to you for refuge,\" answered the Master. \"I never saw  another dog, except a trained pointer or setter, that could handle  birds so tenderly. He--\"    The bumping of a badly handled rowboat, against the dock, at the foot  of the lawn, a hundred yards below, checked his rambling words. Lad, at  sudden attention, by his master's side, watched the boat's occupant  clamber clumsily out of his scow; then stamp along the dock and up the  lawn toward the house. The arrival was a long and lean and lank and  lantern-jawed man with a set of the most fiery red whiskers ever seen  outside a musical comedy. The Master had seen him several times, in the  village; and recognized him as Homer Wefers, the newly-appointed  Township Head Constable. The Mistress recognized him, too, as the  vehement official whose volley of pistol-bullets had ended the  sufferings of the black mongrel. She shivered, in reminiscence, as she  looked at him. The memory he evoked was not pleasant.    \"Morning!\" Wefers observed, curtly, as the Master, with Lad beside him,  stepped forward to greet the scarlet-bearded guest. \"I tried to get  over here, last night. But I guess it's soon enough, today. Has he  showed any signs, yet?\" He nodded inquiringly at the impassive Lad, as  he spoke.    \"'Soon enough' for what?\" queried the puzzled Master.    \"And what sort of 'signs' are you talking about?\"    \"Soon enough to shoot that big brown collie of yours,\" explained  Wefers, with businesslike briskness. \"And I'm asking if he's showed any  signs of hydrophoby. Has he?\"    \"Are you speaking of Laddie?\" asked the Mistress, in dismay; as the  slower-witted Master, stared and gulped. \"Why should he show any signs  of hydrophobia? He--\"    \"If he hasn't, he will,\" rapped out the visitor. \"Or he would, if he  wasn't put out of the way. That's what I'm here for. But I kind of  hoped maybe you folks might have done it, yourselves. Can't be too  careful, you know. 'Specially--\"    \"What in blue blazes are you blithering about?\" roared the Master,  finding his voice and marshaling his startled wits. \"Do you mean--\"    \"I mean,\" said Wefers, rebuking with a cold glare the Master's  disrespectful manner, \"I mean I'm here to shoot that big collie of  yours. He was bit by a mad dog, yesterday. So was three other dogs over  in the village. I shot 'em all; before they had time to d'velop  symptoms and things; or bite anybody. One of 'em,\" he added,  unctuously, \"one of 'em b'longed to that little crippled Posthanger  girl. She cried and begged, something pitiful, when I come for him. But  dooty is dooty. So I--\"    \"OH!\"    The Mistress's horrified monosyllable broke in on the smug recital. She  caught Lad protectingly by the ruff and stared in mute dread at the  lanky and red-whiskered officer. Lad, reading her voice as always,  divined this nasal-toned caller had said or done something to make her  unhappy. His ruff bristled. One corner of his lip lifted in something  which looked like a smile, but which was not. And, very far down in his  throat a growl was born.    But the Master stepped in front of his wife and his dog, and confronted  the constable. Fighting for calmness, he asked:    \"Do I understand that you shot those harmless little pups just because  a dog that was sick, and not rabid, happened to nip them? And that  you've come across here with an idea of doing the same thing to Lad? Is  that it?\"    \"That's the idea,\" assented Wefers. \"I said so, right off, as soon as I  got here. Only, you're wrong about the dog being 'sick.' He was mad.  Had rabies. I'd ought to know. I--\"    \"How and why ought you to know?\" demanded the Master, still battling  for perfect calm, and succeeding none too well. \"How ought you to know?  Are you a veterinary? Have you ever made a study of dogs and of their  maladies? Have you ever read up, carefully, on the subject of rabies?  Have you read Eberhardt or Dr. Bennett or Skinner or any of a dozen  other authorities on the disease? Have you consulted such eminent vets  as Hopper and Finch, for instance? If you have, you certainly must know  that a dog, afflicted with genuine rabies, will no more turn out of his  way to bite anyone than a typhoid patient will jump out of bed to chase  a doctor. I'm not saying that the bite of any sick animal (or of any  sick human, for that matter) isn't more or less dangerous; unless it's  carefully washed out and painted with iodine. But that's no excuse to  go around the country, shooting every dog that some sick mongrel has  snapped at. Put such dogs under observation, if necessary; and then--\"    \"You talk like a fool!\" snorted Wefers, in lofty contempt. \"I--\"    \"But I am going to keep you from acting like a fool,\" returned the  Master, his hard-held temper beginning to fray. \"You say you've come  over here to shoot my dog. If ever anyone shoots Lad, I'll be the man  to do it. And I'll have to have lots better reason for it than--\"    \"Go ahead, then!\" vouchsafed the constable, fishing out a rusty service  pistol from his coat-tail pocket. \"Go ahead and do it yourself, then;  if you'd rather. It's all one to me, so long's it's done.\"    With sardonic politeness, he proffered the bulky weapon. The Master  caught it from his hand and flung it a hundred feet away, into the  center of a clump of lilacs.    \"So much for the gun!\" he blazed, advancing an the astounded Wefers.  \"Now, unless you want to follow it--\"    \"Dear!\" expostulated the Mistress, her sweet voice atremble.    \"I'm an of'cer of the law!\" blustered the offended constable; in the  same breath adding:    \"And resisting an of'cer in the p'soot of his dooty is a misde--\"    He checked himself, unconsciously turning to observe the odd actions of  Lad.    As the Master had hurled the pistol far from him, the collie had sped  in breakneck pursuit of it. Thus, always, did he delight to retrieve  any object the Mistress or the Master might toss for his amusement. It  was one of Laddie's favorite games, this fetching back of anything  thrown. The farther it might be flung and the more difficult its  landing place, the more zest to the sport.    This time, Lad was especially glad at the diversion. From the voices of  these deities of his, Lad had gathered that the Master was furiously  angry and that the Mistress was correspondingly unhappy. Also, that the  lanky and red-bearded visitor was directly responsible for their stress  of feeling. He had been eyeing alternately the Master and Wefers;  tensely awaiting some overt act or some word of permission which should  warrant him in launching himself on the intruder.    And now, it seemed, the whole thing was a game;--a game wherein he  himself had been invited to play a merry and spectacular part.  Joyously, he flew after the hurtling lump of steel and rubber.    The Master, facing the constable, did not see his pet's performance. He  took up the thread of speech where Wefers dropped it.    \"I don't know what the law does or doesn't empower you to do, in such  cases,\" he said, trying to force his way back to the earlier semblance  of calm. \"But I doubt if it permits you to trespass on my land, without  a warrant or a court order of some sort; or to shoot a dog of mine.  And, until I find out the law in the matter, you'll get off this place  and keep off of it. As for the dog, I'll be legally responsible for  him; and I'll guarantee he'll do no damage. So--\"    Like Wefers, the Master came to an abrupt halt in his harangue.    For Lad was cantering gleefully toward "]]]
