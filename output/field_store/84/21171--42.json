When they looked to see where they  stood, they found that Arthur had penned them upon a little bluff of  land that ended steeply over a deep river, and that no way was open for  them to escape from the death of swords, unless they chose to leap on  the rocks below the cliff.    'See!' said Uriens, with a laugh, 'while we fought like wild boars, and  thought of nothing but the killing, this base-born king kept his wits  and moved us like pawns on a chessboard, we all unwitting. First, he  drew us into ambush, and now he thrusts us into a chasm. We war-wise  fighters, grown grey in battle, checkmated by a boy!'    Nevertheless, though wearied, full of dread and shame, and looking  death in the eyes, the little band of men withdrew backwards, waiting  until Arthur should command his lines of glittering knights to dash  upon the remnant of the rebel kings.    'The proud evil men!' said Arthur in anger, looking upon them. 'Though  they know death is upon them, they will not crave mercy of me, a  base-born king, as they name me!'    'Ah, sir king,' said King Ban, 'blame them not, for they do as brave  men ought to do, and they are the best fighting men and the knights of  most prowess that ever I saw. And if they were belonging unto you,  there would be no king under heaven to compare with you for power and  fame and majesty.'    'I cannot love them,' said Arthur sadly, 'for they would destroy me.'    'Now, this is my counsel,' said King Lot to his ten fellows, as he  looked over the field strewn with the dead: 'that we stand together in  a circle and swear to die together--we and our few knights. We have  aimed at a kingdom and a crown, and we have failed. But we will die  like kings and warriors. When they press upon us at the last, let no  one of us break away. If any see another dress him to flee or to yield,  let him slay him. How say ye?'    'It is good!' said they all.    Then, for all their aching wounds, they mended their broken harness  hurriedly, and righted their shields, took new spears from the hands of  their squires, and set them upright on their thighs, and thus, with the  low red light of the westering sun behind them, they stood still and  grim, like a clump of tall leafless trees.    Arthur gave the order to advance, and his knights leaped forward over  the heap of the slain. But just then Sir Kay came to the king, bringing  a knight from the north who had just been captured, bearing messages to  the eleven kings, and Arthur asked him who he was and why he came.    'Sir king,' said the man, 'I am Sir Eliot of the March Tower, and I  have ill tidings for my master, King Uriens, and his friends, but it  seems my news is no worse than their fate. If my great lord is to die,  I would lief die with him. Therefore, lord, despatch me now, or let me  go stand beside my lord in the last rally.'    'What is thy news?' asked King Arthur.    'It is that the pagans, the savage Saxons, have landed in three places  beyond Humber, and all the lands of my lord and his ten fellows shall  suffer fire and sword again.'    'But if I slay your master and his fellow-rebels, whose lands are those  the pagans overrun?'    'Yours, lord, of a truth, if you can dash the pagans from them.'    'If I and my host have swept these rebel kings from before me, think  you I cannot sweep the Saxons from the land?'    'I trow you could, sir king, for on my way hither I have heard of the  marvellous deeds this day of yourself and your knights. But, lord, I  see the press of knights about my dear lord. Ah, that I might strike a  blow for him before I die!'    'Thou shalt strike a-many yet,' said Arthur, and Sir Eliot marvelled.    Arthur commanded his trumpets to blow the retreat, and the knights,  wondering and half unbelieving, withdrew them from about the eleven  kings.    Then, surrounded by his chief lords, Arthur rode to the group of  wearied kings, who, with dented and broken harness, from which the  blood oozed in many places, still kept their seats with undaunted mien.    At King Arthur's command Sir Eliot told his news to King Uriens.    'Now this I have to say to ye,' said Arthur, lifting his vizor and  showing a stern countenance. 'Ye are in my hands, to slay or spare as I  choose. But ye have fought like brave men, and I would that, for your  prowess, ye were my friends rather than mine enemies. Now this I have  to offer ye. Swear here and now to be my lieges, as ye were to King  Uther before me, and I will aid thee to thrust the pagans from your  land, and thenceforth we will aid and cherish each other as true  subjects and true lords should do. But if ye refuse, then your folly be  on your own heads, for then I take your lives and your lands both.'    With that King Uriens threw down his sword and put up his vizor, and  turning to the others, said:    'Fellow-rebels, we should be mad to refuse gifts so kingly and kindly  offered. We have tried a throw with this young king, and we have been  worsted. Better now to own ourselves lesser men than this wise lad  here, and try to live in peace with him henceforth.'    The other kings agreed, but King Lot, mean and revengeful, and the  Kings Nentres and Brandegoris, suspicious that, as had been too often  with themselves, fair words had covered foul intent, held back a  little, until the others swore to leave them to the penalty of their  folly. Whereupon they all knelt down upon the stricken field, and each  put his hands between the hands of King Arthur, and swore upon the  honour of their knighthood to be his true and faithful men while they  lived.    As they rose from rendering their homage, Merlin came riding on a great  black horse.    'Ye have done wisely well, my king,' he said. 'For by this kingly deed  you shall rivet the hearts of the good men among these former rebels  closer to your own than with rivets of steel. Thus well and wisely have  ye won your kingdom and the fealty of these brave men.'    'Now,' he went on to the eleven kings, 'ye doubted whether Arthur was  of noble birth, and rightful king. Know ye that he is the son of the  noble King Uther, who by my counsel hid him away on his birth. Ye will  remember how Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, hated Uther for taking Igraine  for wife, whom Gorlois had captured and sworn to wed for her beauty and  her wealth. And how all the turbulent lords did cling to Gorlois, and  how for years King Uther had much ado to keep those rebels from  dismembering the kingdom. Gorlois had vowed to slay by poison or  treachery any son of Uther's, and so I took young Arthur into safe  keeping. None knew of him until King Uther named him as his rightful  heir upon his deathbed in the presence of you all. So, therefore, ye do  well to give your homage to this your king, for Arthur is the son right  worshipful of the great Pendragon, and the lovely lady, Igraine of  Lyonesse.'    All that stood by marvelled, and most of the eleven kings were glad  that they had a king so noble in birth and doing as Arthur, the son of  Uther Pendragon.          II    SIR BALIN AND THE STROKE DOLOROUS      It happened that on a day King Arthur, wandering from his court, had  fought and vanquished a valiant knight, but he himself had been sore  wounded. Merlin, coming to his aid, had taken him to a hermit's cave,  and there with many marvellous salves had searched his wounds, so that  in three days the king was whole again.    Riding forth together, Merlin led the king deeper and deeper into a  wild and desolate country where he had never been before, and where  there were no pathways. Arthur looked to and fro over the waste, but  saw no sign of man or beast, and no bird flitted or piped. Great gaunt  stones stood upright on the hillsides, solitary or in long lines as if  they marched, or else they leaned together as if conspiring; while  great heaps or cairns of stone rose here and there from the  lichen-covered and rocky soil, in which the grass grew weakly in small  crevices.    The mists now rose and drifted before them as they rode, the light was  low and sallow, and the wind began to whisper shrilly among the great  stones, and in the crannies of the cairns.    The king crossed himself, and looked at the white, old, and wrinkled  face of Merlin; but the wizard seemed sunk in thought. Then Arthur  bethought him that, in case some fiend-shape or wizard-knight should  assail him in that desolate waste, he could not defend himself,  inasmuch as his sword--the sword he had drawn from the stone--had  snapped when he fought the knight, and he had no other weapon with him.    'Merlin,' he said, 'this is a place of ancient death and terror, and if  aught should assail us of evil, I have no sword.'    'For that reason I bring thee here,' replied Merlin, and would not  utter another word.    Then, through the mists, which writhed and twisted as if they were fell  shapes that would tear down the passing riders, Arthur became aware  that their way was leading downwards, and soon the smell of water rose  up to him.    He heard the beat and suck of waves upon a shore, and in a little while  the mists cleared as if at a word, and there before him Arthur saw a  lonely lake or sea, hedged round with salt-rimed reeds and sedges, and  stretching out its waters, dull and leaden-hued, to so great a distance  that his eye could see no end.    'What is this place?' he asked of Merlin.    'It is the Lake of the Endless Waters,' said the wizard.    'Why bring ye me to this desolate lake in the wilderness?'    'You shall visit it once more--ere you die!' replied Merlin. 'But look  you there in the midmost of the lake.'    Looking to where the wizard pointed, Arthur saw a great hand, clothed  in white samite, stretched above the lapsing waves, and in its grasp  was a long two-handed sword in a rich scabbard.    With that they saw a barge riding over the water, and it came without  oars or any sail, and in the prow sat a woman, tall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#6)"],[1,"  Leicester's excellent troupe.    [Footnote 31: Deposition by Robert Myles, 1592, printed in Wallace's  _The First London Theatre_, p. 141.]    Having in 1575 conceived the notion of erecting a building specially  designed for dramatic entertainments, he was at once confronted with  the problem of a suitable location. Two conditions narrowed his  choice: first, the site had to be outside the jurisdiction of the  Common Council; secondly, it had to be as near as possible to the  city.    No doubt he at once thought of the two suburbs that were specially  devoted to recreation, the Bankside to the south, and Finsbury Field  to the north of the city. The Bankside had for many years been  associated in the minds of Londoners with \"sports and pastimes.\"  Thither the citizens were accustomed to go to witness bear-baiting  and bull-baiting, to practice archery, and to engage in various  athletic sports. Thither, too, for many years the actors had gone to  present their plays. In 1545 King Henry VIII had issued a proclamation  against vagabonds, ruffians, idle persons, and common players,[32] in  which he referred to their \"fashions commonly used at the Bank.\" The  Bankside, however, was associated with the lowest and most vicious  pleasures of London, for here were situated the stews, bordering the  river's edge. Since the players were at this time subject to the  bitterest attacks from the London preachers, Burbage wisely decided  not to erect the first permanent home of the drama in a locality  already a common target for puritan invective.    [Footnote 32: See page 134.]    The second locality, Finsbury Field, had nearly all the advantages,  and none of the disadvantages, of the Bankside. Since 1315 the Field  had been in the possession of the city,[33] and had been used as a  public playground, where families could hold picnics, falconers could  fly their hawks, archers could exercise their sport, and the militia  on holidays could drill with all \"the pomp and circumstance of  glorious war.\" In short, the Field was eminently respectable, was  accessible to the city, and was definitely associated with the idea of  entertainment. The locality, therefore, was almost ideal for the  purpose Burbage had in mind.[34]    [Footnote 33: See _The Remembrancia_, p. 274; Stow, _Survey_. The  Corporation of London held the manor on lease from St. Paul's  Cathedral until 1867.]    [Footnote 34: Doubtless, too, Burbage was influenced in his choice by  the fact that he had already made his home in the Liberty of  Shoreditch, near Finsbury Field.]    The new playhouse, of course, could not be erected in the Field  itself, which was under the control of the city; but just to the east  of the Field certain vacant land, part of the dissolved Priory of  Holywell, offered a site in every way suitable to the purpose. The  Holywell property, at the dissolution of the Priory, had passed under  the jurisdiction of the Crown, and hence the Lord Mayor and the  Aldermen could not enforce municipal ordinances there. Moreover, it  was distant from the city wall not much more than half a mile. The old  conventual church had been demolished, the Priory buildings had been  converted into residences, and the land near the Shoreditch highway  had been built up with numerous houses. The land next to the Field,  however, was for the most part undeveloped. It contained some  dilapidated tenements, a few old barns formerly belonging to the  Priory, and small garden plots, conspicuous objects in the early maps.    [Illustration: THE SITE OF THE FIRST PLAYHOUSES    Finsbury Field lies to the north (beyond Moor Field, the small  rectangular space next to the city wall), and the Holywell Property  lies to the right of Finsbury Field, between the Field and the  highway. Holywell Lane divides the garden plots; the Theatre was  erected just to the north, and the Curtain just to the south of this  lane, facing the Field. (From the _Map of London_ by Braun and  Hogenbergius representing the city as it was in 1554-1558.)]    Burbage learned that a large portion of this land lying next to the  Field was in the possession of a well-to-do gentleman named Gyles  Alleyn,[35] and that Alleyn was willing to lease a part of his  holding on the conditions of development customary in this section of  London. These conditions are clearly revealed in a chancery suit of  1591:         The ground there was for the most part converted first into       garden plots, and then leasing the same to diverse tenants       caused them to covenant or promise to build upon the same,       by occasion whereof the buildings which are there were for       the most part erected and the rents increased.[36]    [Footnote 35: For a detailed history of the property from the year  1128, and for the changes in the ownership of Alleyn's portion after  the dissolution, see Braines, _Holywell Priory_.]    [Footnote 36: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 365. The suit  concerns the Curtain property, somewhat south of the Alleyn property,  but a part of the Priory.]    The part of Alleyn's property on which Burbage had his eye was in sore  need of improvement. It consisted of five \"paltry tenements,\"  described as \"old, decayed, and ruinated for want of reparation, and  the best of them was but of two stories high,\" and a long barn \"very  ruinous and decayed and ready to have fallen down,\" one half of which  was used as a storage-room, the other half as a slaughter-house. Three  of the tenements had small gardens extending back to the Field, and  just north of the barn was a bit of \"void ground,\" also adjoining the  Field. It was this bit of \"void ground\" that Burbage had selected as a  suitable location for his proposed playhouse. The accompanying map of  the property[37] will make clear the position of this \"void ground\"  and of the barns and tenements about it. Moreover, it will serve to  indicate the exact site of the Theatre. If one will bear in mind the  fact that in the London of to-day Curtain Road marks the eastern  boundary of Finsbury Field, and New Inn Yard cuts off the lower half  of the Great Barn, he will be able to place Burbage's structure within  a few yards.[38]    [Footnote 37: I have based this map in large measure on the documents  presented by Braines in his excellent pamphlet, _Holywell Priory_.]    [Footnote 38: For proof see Braines, _op. cit._]    [Illustration: A PLAN OF BURBAGE'S HOLYWELL PROPERTY    Based on the lease, and on the miscellaneous documents printed by  Halliwell-Phillipps and by Braines. The \"common sewer\" is now marked  by Curtain Road, and the \"ditch from the horse-pond\" by New Inn Yard.]    The property is carefully described in the lease--quoted below--which  Burbage secured from Alleyn, but the reader will need to refer to the  map in order to follow with ease the several paragraphs of  description:[39]         All those two houses or tenements, with appurtenances, which       at the time of the said former demise made were in the       several tenures or occupations of Joan Harrison, widow, and       John Dragon.
