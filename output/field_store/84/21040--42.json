Still higher  forms are marvelously intricate and graceful, yet not less geometric and  symmetrical.    [Illustration: FIG. 489.--Theoretical development of scroll work.]    Let us turn to the primitive artisan, and observe him at work with rude  brush and stylus upon the rounded and irregular forms of his  utensils and weapons, or upon skins, bark, and rock surfaces. Is it  probable that with his free hand directed by the eye alone he will be  able to achieve these rythmic geometric forms. It seems to me that the  whole tendency is in the opposite direction. I venture to surmise that  if there had been no other resources than those named above the typical  rectilinear fret would never have been known, at least to the primitive  world; for, notwithstanding the contrary statement by Professor Hartt,  the fret is in its more highly-developed forms extremely difficult to  follow with the eye and to delineate with the hand. Until arts,  geometric in their construction, arose to create and to combine  mechanically the necessary elements and motives, and lead the way by a  long series of object-lessons to ideas of geometric combination, our  typical border ornament would not be possible. Such arts are the textile  arts and architecture. These brought into existence forms and ideas not  met with in nature and not primarily thought of by man, and combined  them in defiance of human, conceptions of grace. Geometric ornament is  the offspring of technique.      INDEX.

And I, \"My lord, let us go on with greater speed, for now I mu  not weary as before; and behold now how the bill casts its  shadow.\" \"We will go forward with this day,\" he answered, \"as  much further as we shall yet be able; but the fact is of other  form than thou supposest. Before thou art there-above thou wilt  see him return, who is now hidden by the hill-side so that thou  dost not make his rays to break. But see there a soul which  seated all alone is looking toward us; it will point out to us  the speediest way.\" We came to it. O Lombard soul, how lofty and  scornful wast thou; and in the movement of thine eyes grave and  slow! It said not anything to us, but let us go on, looking only  in manner of a lion when he couches. Virgil, however, drew near  to it, praying that it would show to us the best ascent; and it  answered not to his request, but of our country and life it asked  us. And the sweet Leader began, \"Mantua,\"--and the shade, all in  itself recluse, rose toward him from the place where erst it was,  saying, \"O Mantuan, I am Sordello of thy city,\"[1]--and they  embraced each other.    [1] Sordello, who lived early in the thirteenth century, was of  the family of the Visconti of Mantua. He left his native land and  gave up his native tongue to live and write as a troubadour in  Provence, but his fame belonged to Italy.      Ah, servile Italy, hostel of grief! ship without pilot in great  tempest! not lady of provinces, but a brothel! that gentle soul  was so ready, only at the sweet sound of his native land, to give  glad welcome here unto his fellow-citizen: and now in thee thy  living men exist not without war, and of those whom one wall and  one moat shut in one doth gnaw the other. Search, wretched one,  around the shores, thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,  if any part in thee enjoyeth peace! What avails it that for thee  Justinian should mend the bridle, if the saddle be empty? Without  this, the shame would be less. Ah folk,[1] that oughtest to be  devout and let Caesar sit in the saddle, if thou rightly  understandest what God notes for thee! Look how fell this wild  beast has become, through not being corrected by the spurs, since  thou didst put thy hand upon the bridle. O German Albert, who  abandonest her who has become untamed and savage, and oughtest to  bestride her saddle-bows, may a just judgment from the stars fall  upon thy blood, and may it be strange and manifest, so that thy  successor may have fear of it! [2] For thou and thy father,  retained up there by greed, have suffered the garden of the  empire to become desert. Come thou to see Montecchi and  Cappelletti, Monaldi and Filippeschi,[3] thou man without care:  those already wretched, and these in dread. Come, cruel one,  come, and see the distress of thy nobility, and cure their hurts;  and thou shalt see Santafiora[4] how safe it is. Come to see thy  Rome, that weeps, widowed and alone, and day and night cries, \"My  Caesar, wherefore dost thou not keep me company?\" Come to see the  people, how loving it is; and, if no pity for us move thee, come  to be shamed by thine own renown! And if it be lawful for me, O  Supreme Jove that wast on earth crucified for us, are thy just  eyes turned aside elsewhere? Or is it preparation, that in the  abyss of thy counsel thou art making for some good utterly cut  off from our perception? For the cities of Italy are all full of  tyrants, and every churl that comes playing the partisan becomes  a Marcellus?[5]    [1] The Church-folk, the clergy, for whom God has ordained, --  \"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's.\"    [2] Albert of Hapsburg, son of the Emperor Rudolph, was elected  King of the Romans in 1298, but like his father never went to  Italy to he crowned. He was murdered by his nephew, John, called  the parricide, in 1308, at Konigsfelden. The successor of Albert  was Henry VII. of Luxemborg, who came to Italy in 1311, was  crowned at Rome in 1312, and died at Buonconvento the next year.  His death ended the hopes of Dante.    [3] Famous families, the first two of Verona, the last two of  Orvieto, at enmity with each other in their respective  cities,--types of a common condition.    [4]The Counts of Santafiora were once the most powerful  Ghibelline nobles in the Sienese territory. Their power had  declined since the Hohenstaufen Emperors had been succeeded by  the Hapsburgs, and they were now subjected to the Guelphs of  Siena.    [5] That is, a hitter opponent of the empire, as the Consul M.  Claudius Marcellus was of Caesar.      My Florence! surely thou mayst be content with this digression,  which toucheth thee not, thanks to thy people that for itself  takes heed. Many have justice at heart but shoot slowly, in order  not to come without counsel to the bow; but thy people has it on  the edge of its lips. Many reject the common burden, but thy  people, eager, replies without being called on, and cries, \"I  load myself.\" Now be thou glad, for thou hast truly wherefore:  thou rich, thou in peace, thou wise. If I speak the truth, the  result hides it not. Athens and Lacedaemon, that made the ancient  laws and were so civilized, made toward living well a little  sign, compared with thee that makest such finespun provisions,  that to mid November reaches not, what thou in October spinnest.  How often in the time that thou rememberest, law, money, office,  and custom, hast thou changed, and renewed thy members! And if  thou mind thee well and see the light, thou wilt see thyself  resembling a sick woman, who cannot find repose upon the  feathers, but with her tossing seeks to relieve her pain.        CANTO VII. Virgil makes himself known to Sordello.--Sordello  leads the Poets to the Valley of the Princes who have been  negligent of salvation.--He points them out by name.      After the becoming and glad salutations had been repeated three  and four times, Sordello drew back and said, \"Ye, who are ye?\"  \"Before the souls worthy to ascend to God were turned unto this  mountain, my bones had been buried by Octavian; I am Virgil, and  for no other sin did I lose heaven, but for not having faith,\"  thus then replied my Leader.    As is he who suddenly sees a thing before him whereat he marvels,  and doth and doth not believe, saying, \"It is, it is not,\"--so  seemed that shade, and then he bent down his brow, and humbly  turned again toward him and embraced him where the inferior takes  hold.    \"O glory of the Latins,\" said he, \"through whom our language  showed what it could do, O honor eternal of the place wherefrom I  was, what merit or what grace shows thee to me? If I am worthy to  hear thy words, tell me if thou comest from Hell, and from what  cloister.\" \"Through all the circles of the realm of woe,\" replied  he to him, \"am I come hither; Power of Heaven moved me, and with  it I come. Not by doing, but by not doing have I lost the sight  of the high Sun whom thou desirest, and who by me was known late.  A place there is below not sad with torments but with darkness  only, where the lamentations sound not as wailings, but are  sighs; there stay I with the little innocents bitten by the teeth  of death before they were exempt from human sin; there stay I  with those who were not vested with the three holy virtues, and  without vice knew the others and followed all of them.[1] But if  thou knowest and canst, give us some direction whereby we may  come more speedily there where Purgatory has its true beginning.\"  He replied, \"A certain place is not set for us; it is permitted  me to go upward and around; so far as I can go I join myself to  thee as guide. But see how already the day declines, and to go up  by night is not possible; therefore it is well to think of some  fair sojourn. There are souls here on the right apart; if thou  consentest to me I will lead thee to them, and not without  delight will they be known to thee.\" \"How is this?\" was answered,  \"he who might wish to ascend by night, would he be hindered by  another, or would he not be able to ascend?\" And the good  Sordello drew his finger on the ground, saying, \"See, only this  line thou couldst not pass after set of sun; not because aught  else save the nocturnal darkness would give hindrance to going  up; that hampers the will with impotence.[2] One could, indeed,  in it[3] turn downward and walk the hillside wandering around,  while the horizon holds the day shut up.\" Then my Lord, as if  wondering, said, \"Lead us, then, there where thou sayest one may  have delight while waiting.\"    [1] The virtuous Heathen did not possess the so-called  theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity; but they  practiced the four cardinal virtues of Prudence, Temperance,  Fortitude and Justice.    [2] The allegory is plain: the soul can mount the steep of  purification only when illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace.    [3] In the darkness.      Little way had we gone from that place, when I perceived that the  mountain was hollowed out in like fashion as the valleys hollow  them here on earth. \"Yonder,\" said that shade, \"will we go, where  the hillside makes a lap of itself, and there will we await the  new day.\" Between steep and level was a winding path that led us  into a side of the dale, where more than by half the edge dies  away. Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and white, Indian wood  lucid and clear,[1] fresh emerald at the instant it is split,  would each be vanquished in color by the herbage and by the  flowers set within that valley, as by its greater the less is  vanquished. Nature had not only painted there, but with sweetness  of a thousand odors she made there one unknown and blended.    [1] The blue of indigo.      Upon the green and upon the flowers I saw souls who, because of  the valley,"]]]
