My battered and broken  trunk, which, at the hands of the English customs officials had suffered  much, had now to be repaired and put to a good long test. This box was  in a state of total collapse; rollers all gone, covering torn and bent,  screws and nails lost, sides split, bottom entirely dropped out, but it  must go; so my big brother was wheedled into putting it into some kind  of shape again, and it came out stronger than before.    No lunches were needed. The cuisine of the Hannah was said to be as  perfect as could be in this far away corner of the globe, and we trusted  to that.    On September sixteenth the Hannah sounded her whistle--all was hurry and  bustle, and such a sight! If hundreds had stood on the docks to welcome  us as we entered the city, there were thousands now. It was pleasant. We  felt flattered, especially as the band struck up our own national airs,  giving us a medley of \"Yankee Doodle,\" \"America,\" \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp,\"  and \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home.\" They felt constrained, however,  to wind up with \"Sweet Marie,\" and rag-time dances, one old fellow in  slouch hat and with a few drinks too many, stepping the jigs off in  lively and comical fashion.    Our pride was perceptibly lessened afterward, when we learned that we  had on board a dance hall outfit, and the band belonged to the Monte  Carlo saloon!    We were now in the midst of a group, cosmopolitan beyond our wildest  dreams. Pushing their way through the crowd to the gangplank came men,  women and dogs, carrying grips, kodaks, tin cash boxes, musical  instruments, army sacks, fur robes, and rolls of blankets. Struggling  under the weight of canvas tents, poles, Yukon stoves and sleds, as well  as every conceivable thing, they climbed the stairway to the deck. Here,  and in the main saloon, all was deposited for the time being.    There was a woman with a fine grey cat, for which she had been offered  fifty dollars, wrapped in a warm shawl, much to pussy's disgust. A  number of women had dogs and were weeping, probably at leaving other  canines behind. Several persons carried little grips so heavy that they  tugged along--evidently \"Chechako,\" or paper money, was more scarce with  them than dust and nuggets.    As freight, there was a piano, many iron-bound boxes containing gold  bullion, securely sealed and labeled, and tons of supplies for the  consumption of the passengers, of whom there were now five hundred.    Then the whistle again sounded--the gangplank was hauled in,  handkerchiefs fluttered, the band struck up \"Home Sweet Home\"--we were  headed down the Yukon River and toward the Arctic Circle.           *       *       *       *       *    We had now a journey of seventeen hundred miles before us. We were to  traverse a country almost unknown to man. We were two of a party of five  hundred persons, the majority of whom, if not actually desperadoes, were  reckless and given over to the pursuit of gold regardless of the manner  of its getting. There were loose characters of the town by hundreds;  there were gamblers running a variety of games both day and night; there  were dance house girls and musicians; there were drunks and toughs, and  one prize fighter. No firearms or knives were seen, though many, no  doubt, had them.    With the enormous amount of gold on board (for the steamer's safe was  overflowing, and the purser's room well packed with the precious stuff),  with the numbers of hard characters we carried, and the now increasing  remoteness from centres of government, there were dangers, we were  forced to confess, but which we only admitted in whispers.    Three hours after leaving Dawson we were taking on wood at Forty Mile.  This is the oldest camp on the Yukon River, and the early home of Jack  McQuestion. The river banks were lined with canoes; many natives stood  looking at us from the shore, and while stevedores handled the wood,  many passengers visited the town. It was not long before they came back  with hands full of turnips, just pulled from the ground, which, had they  been the most luscious fruit, could not have been eaten with more  relish.    I then tried to buy one of a young man, but he had evidently been long  away from such luxuries, for he refused to sell; afterward, his  gallantry getting the better of him, he politely offered me one-half of  the vegetable, which I took with thanks.    As my brother peeled the precious turnip, I asked him how long since he  had eaten one. \"Two years,\" he promptly replied. Knowing that he was  especially fond of such things, I ate a small slice, and gave him the  remainder. It is needless to say he enjoyed it.    To the right of the landing at Forty Mile, just across a small stream  which runs into the Yukon, is Fort Cudahy, containing the stores and  warehouses of one of the large companies, as well as a post-office.    [Illustration: EAGLE CITY, ON THE YUKON, IN 1899.]    But we were soon off again, steaming along between hills yellow with  fading poplar leaves and green streaked with pines. Many rocky spurs  towered grandly heavenward, with tops, like silvered heads, covered with  newly fallen snow. The Yukon is here very crooked and narrow, and abrupt  banks hedged our steamer in on all sides.    Next morning early we arrived at Eagle City, Alaska. We were now in  Uncle Sam's land, and breathed more freely. We felt at home. We cheered  and waved our handkerchiefs to the blue uniformed soldiers on the river  bank who had come to see us.    We went ashore and called upon lieutenant L., lately from his home in  Connecticut and campaigning in Cuba. Taking us into a log house near by,  he pointed out forty thousand rounds of ammunition and one hundred and  fifteen Krag-Jorgensen rifles of the latest pattern.    Here were stationed one hundred and fifteen men, some of them at that  time out moose hunting and fishing. Captain Ray, an old white-haired  gentleman, stood outside his cabin door. At Eagle we saw the new  government barracks just being finished, the logs and shingles having  been sawed at the government saw-mill near by, at the mouth of Mission  Creek.    We were particularly struck with the very youthful appearance of our  soldiers, and their wistful faces as they watched our preparations for  departure.    The lieutenant had said that life in Cuba, or in almost any old place  was preferable to that at Eagle, with the long winter staring them in  the face, and we could see that the poor fellow longed for home. We were  quite touched, but tried to cheer him as best we could.    Circle City, on a big bend of the river from which it derives its name,  was reached the following evening. Here all hands crowded over the  gangplank and into the stores. In less time than it takes to write it,  these places were filled with miners, each man pulling away at his  strong, old pipe, the companion of many weary months perhaps; while over  the counters they handed their gold dust in payment for the \"best plug  cut,\" chewing gum, candy, or whatever else they saw that looked  tempting. Here we bought two pairs of beaded moccasins for seven  dollars.    As a heavy fog settled down upon us, our captain thought best to tie up  the steamer over night, and did so. Next morning by daylight we saw the  offices of the United States marshal; both log cabins with dirt roofs,  upon which bunches of tall weeds were going to seed. We hoped this was  not symbolical of the state of Uncle Sam's affairs in the interior, but  feared it might be, as the places seemed deserted.    Many of the one thousand cabins at Circle were now vacant, but it is the  largest town next to Dawson on the Yukon River.    During the whole of the next day our pilots steered cautiously over the  Yukon Flats.    This is a stretch of about four hundred miles of low, swampy country,  where the Yukon evidently loses its courage to run swiftly, for it  spreads out indolently in all directions between treacherous and  shifting sand-bars, fairly disheartening to all not familiar with its  many peculiarities.    We now learned for the first time that we were practically in the hands  of three pilots, two of whom were Eskimos, one of them on a salary of  five hundred dollars per month. This man was perfectly familiar with the  entire river, being an expert pilot, as he proved during this trip to  the satisfaction of all.    Owing to the near approach of winter, and the extremely low water at  this point, the captain, crew, and many others, wore anxious faces until  the Flats were well passed. Should our steamer stick fast on a sand-bar,  or take fire, we might easily be landed; but to be left in such a bleak  and barren place, with cold weather approaching, snow beginning to fall,  no shelter, and only provisions for a few days, with traveling  companions of the very worst type, and no passing steamers to pick us  up, we would indeed meet a hard fate, and one even the prospect of which  was well calculated to make strong men shudder.          CHAPTER V    AT THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.      We were now at the Arctic Circle. For three days we had no sunshine, and  flurries of snow were frequent. The mountain tops, as well as the banks  and sand-bars of the river, were spread with a thin covering of snow;  enough at least to give a wintry aspect. This added to the leaden sky  above, made the warmth of big coal fires acceptable indoors, and fur  coats comfortable on the decks.    At Fort Yukon the low water prevented our landing. We were told,  however, that the place contained one hundred log houses, as well as an  old Episcopal Mission, in which Mrs. Bumpus had lived and taught the  natives for twenty years. Many of the Eskimo girls are trained as  children's nurses and make very satisfactory ones.    Into the Yukon Flats empty the Porcupine River, Birch Creek and other  streams. Fort Yukon was established by the Hudson Bay Company many years "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#6)"],[1,"punish the parrot?\" they asked the thief.    \"I think we will no longer let him live in our homes,\" answered the  thief.    \"Yes,\" said the others, \"he must fly away to the forest, and even when  there is a storm, he can no longer come to our homes, because we know  now that he is a bird of a lying tongue.\"    [Illustration: \"THIS BIRD HAS ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH\"]    So the parrot flew away sorrowfully into the lonely forest. He met a  mocking-bird and told him what had happened.    \"Why did you not repeat men's words as I do?\" asked the mocking-bird.  \"Men always think their own words are good.\"    \"But the man's words were not true,\" said the parrot.    \"That is nothing,\" replied the mocking-bird, laughing. \"Say what they  say, and they will think you are a wonderful bird.\"    \"Yes, I see,\" said the parrot thoughtfully, \"and I will never again be  punished for telling the truth. I will only repeat the words of others.\"          THE STORY OF THE FIRST MOCKING-BIRD.      Far away in the forest there once lived the most cruel man on all the  earth. He did not like the Indians, and he said to himself, \"Some day I  will be ruler of them all.\" Then he thought, \"There are many brave  warriors among the Indians, and I must first put them to death.\"    He was cunning as well as cruel, and he soon found a way to kill the  warriors. He built some wigwams and made fires before them as if people  lived in each one.    One day a hunter on his way home heard a baby crying in one of the  wigwams. He went in, but he never came out again. Another day a hunter  heard a child laughing. He went in, but he never came out again. So it  was day after day. One hunter heard a woman talking, and went to see who  it was; another heard a man calling to people in the other wigwams, and  went to see who they were; and no one who once went into a wigwam ever  came out.    One young brave had heard the voices, but he feared there was magic  about them, and so he had never gone into the wigwams; but when he saw  that his friends did not come back, he went to the wigwams and called,  \"Where are all the people that I have heard talk and laugh?\"    \"Talk and laugh,\" said the cunning man mockingly.    \"Where are they? Do you know?\" cried the brave, and the cunning man  called, \"Do you know?\" and laughed.    \"Whose voices have I heard?\"    \"Have I heard?\" mocked the cunning man.    \"I heard a baby cry.\"    \"Cry,\" said the cunning man.    \"Who is with you?\"    \"You.\"    Then the young brave was angry. He ran into the first wigwam, and there  he found the man who had cried like a baby and talked in a voice like a  woman's and made all the other sounds. The brave caught him by the leg  and threw him down upon the earth.    \"It was you who cried and talked and laughed,\" he said. \"I heard your  voice and now you are going to be punished for killing our braves. Where  is my brother, and where are our friends?\"    \"How do I know?\" cried the man. \"Ask the sun or the moon or the fire if  you will, but do not ask me;\" and all the time he was trying to pull the  young brave into the flames.    \"I will ask the fire,\" said the brave. \"Fire, you are a good friend to  us Indians. What has this cruel man done with our warriors?\"    The fire had no voice, so it could not answer, but it sprang as far away  from the hunter as it could, and there where the flames had been he saw  two stone arrowheads.    \"I know who owned the two arrowheads,\" said the brave. \"You have thrown  my friends into your fire. Now I will do to you what you have done to  them.\"    He threw the cunning man into the fire. His head burst into two pieces,  and from between them a bird flew forth. Its voice was loud and clear,  but it had no song of its own. It could only mock the songs of other  birds, and that is why it is called the mocking-bird.          WHY THE TAIL OF THE FOX HAS A WHITE TIP.      \"I must have a boy to watch my sheep and my cows,\" thought an old woman,  and so she went out to look for a boy. She looked first in the fields  and then in the forest, but nowhere could she find a boy. As she was  walking down the path to her home, she met a bear.    \"Where are you going?\" asked the bear.    \"I am looking for a boy to watch my cows and my sheep,\" she answered.    \"Will you have me?\"    \"Yes, if you know how to call my animals gently.\"    \"Ugh, ugh,\" called the bear. He tried to call softly, but he had always  growled before, and now he could do nothing but growl.    \"No, no,\" said the old woman, \"your voice is too loud. Every cow in the  field would run, and every sheep would hide, if you should growl like  that. I will not have you.\"    Then the old woman went on till she met a wolf.    \"Where are you going, grandmother?\" he asked.    \"I am looking for a boy to watch my cows and my sheep,\" she answered.    \"Will you have me?\" asked the wolf.    \"Yes,\" she said, \"if you know how to call my animals gently.\"    \"Ho-y, ho-y,\" called the wolf.    \"Your voice is too high,\" said the old woman. \"My cows and my sheep  would tremble whenever they heard it. I will not have you.\"    Then the old woman went on till she met a fox.    \"I am so glad to meet you,\" said the fox. \"Where are you going this  bright morning?\"    \"I am going home now,\" she said, \"for I cannot find a boy to watch my  cows and my sheep. The bear growls and the wolf calls in too high a  voice. I do not know what I can do, for I am too old to watch cows and  sheep.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said the cunning fox, \"you are not old, but any one as  beautiful as you must not watch sheep in the fields. I shall be very  glad to do the work for you if you will let me.\"    \"I know that my sheep will like you,\" said she.    \"And I know that I shall like them dearly,\" said the fox.    \"Can you call them gently, Mr. Fox?\" she asked.    \"Del-dal-halow, del-dal-halow,\" called the fox, in so gentle a voice  that it was like a whisper.    \"That is good, Mr. Fox,\" said the old woman. \"Come home with me, and I  will take you to the fields where my animals go.\"    Each day one of the cows or one of the sheep was gone when the fox came  home at night. \"Mr. Fox, where is my cow?\" the old woman would ask, or,  \"Mr. Fox, where is my sheep?\" and the fox would answer with a sorrowful  look, \"The bear came out of the woods, and he has eaten it,\" or, \"The  wolf came running through the fields, and he has eaten it.\"    The old woman was sorry to lose her sheep and her cows, but she thought,  \"Mr. Fox must be even more sorry than I. I will go out to the field and  carry him a drink of cream.\"    [Illustration]    She went to the field, and there stood the fox with the body of a sheep,  for it was he who had killed and eaten every one that was gone. When he  saw the old woman coming, he started to run away.    \"You cruel, cunning fox!\" she cried.    She had nothing to throw at him but the cream, so she threw that. It  struck the tip of his tail, and from that day to this, the tip of the  fox's tail has been as white as cream.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST FROG.      Once upon a time there was a man who had two children, a boy and a girl,  whom he treated cruelly. The boy and the girl talked together one day,  and the boy, Wah-wah-hoo, said to his sister, \"Dear little sister, are  you happy with our father?\"    \"No,\" answered the girl, whose name was Hah-hah. \"He scolds me and beats  me, and I can never please him.\"    \"He was angry with me this morning,\" said the boy, \"and he beat me till  the blood came. See there!\"    \"Let us run away,\" said Hah-hah. \"The beasts and the birds will be good  to us. They really love us, and we can be very happy together.\"    That night the two children ran away from their cruel father. They went  far into the forest, and at last they found a wigwam in which no one  lived.    When the father found that Wah-wah-hoo and his sister were gone, he was  very unhappy. He went out into the forest to see if he could find them.  \"If they would only come again,\" he said aloud, \"I would do everything I  could to please them.\"    \"Do you think he tells the truth?\" asked the wolf.    \"I do not know,\" answered the mosquito. \"He never treated them well when  they were with him.\"    \"Wolf,\" called the father, \"will you tell me where my children are?\"    Wah-wah-hoo had once told the wolf when a man was coming to shoot him,  and so the wolf would not tell where they were.    \"Mosquito,\" said the father, \"where are my children?\"    Hah-hah had once helped the mosquito to go home when the wind was too  strong for him, and so the mosquito would not tell.    For a long time Wah-wah-hoo and his sister were really happy in the  forest, for there was no one to scold them and to beat them, but at last  there was a cold, cold winter. All the earth was covered with snow. The  animals had gone, and Wah-wah-hoo could find no food. Death came and  bore away the gentle Hah-hah. Wah-wah-hoo sat alone in the gloomy wigwam  wailing for his sister. Then in his sadness he threw himself down from a  high mountain and was killed.    All this time the father had been looking for his children, and at last  he saw his son lying at the foot of the mountain. Then he too wailed and  cried aloud, for he was really sorry that he had treated them so  cruelly. He was a magician, and he could make his son live, but he could  not make him a boy again.    \"You shall be a frog,\" said he, \"and you shall make your home in the  marsh with the reeds and the rushes. There you shall wail as loud as you  will for your sister, and once every moon I will come and wail for her  with you. I was cruel to you and to her, and so I must live alone in my  gloomy wigwam.\"    Every summer night one can hear the frog in the marsh wailing for his  dear sister Hah-hah. Sometimes a louder voice is heard, and that is the  voice of the father wailing because he was so cruel.    [Illustration]          WHY THE RABBIT IS TIMID.
