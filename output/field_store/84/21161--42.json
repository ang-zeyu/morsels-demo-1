A head presently peeped out of the  water to see who it was that disturbed them.    \"My friend,\" said Grasshopper, in his most persuasive manner, \"could you  not oblige me by turning me into a beaver like yourself. Nothing would  please me so much as to make your acquaintance, I can assure you;\" for  Grasshopper was curious to know how these watery creatures lived, and  what kind of notions they had.    \"I do not know,\" replied the beaver, who was rather short-nosed and  surly. \"I will go and ask the others. Meanwhile stay where you are, if  you please.\"    \"To be sure,\" answered Grasshopper, stealing down the bank several paces  as soon as the beaver's back was turned.    Presently there was a great splashing of the water, and all the beavers  showed their heads, and looked warily to where he stood, to see if he  was armed; but he had knowingly left his bow and arrows in a hollow tree  at a short distance.    After a long conversation, which they conducted in a whisper so that  Grasshopper could not catch a word, strain his ears as he would, they  all advanced in a body toward the spot where he stood; the chief  approaching the nearest, and lifting his head highest out of the water.    \"Can you not,\" said Grasshopper, noticing that they waited for him to  speak first, \"turn me into a beaver? I wish to live among you.\"    \"Yes,\" answered their chief; \"lie down.\" And Grasshopper in a moment  found himself a beaver, and was gliding into the water, when a thought  seemed to strike him, and he paused at the edge of the lake. \"I am very  small,\" he said, to the beaver, in a sorrowful tone. \"You must make me  large,\" he said; for Grasshopper was terribly ambitious, and wanted  always to be the first person in every company. \"Larger than any of you;  in my present size it's hardly worth my while to go into the water.\"    \"Yes, yes!\" said they. \"By and by, when we get into the lodge it shall  be done.\"    They all dived into the lake, and in passing great heaps of limbs and  logs at the bottom, he asked the use of them; they answered, \"It is for  our winter's provisions.\"    When they all got into the lodge their number was about one hundred. The  lodge was large and warm.    \"Now we will make you large,\" said they. \"Will _that_ do?\"    \"Yes,\" he answered; for he found that he was ten times the size of the  largest.    \"You need not go out,\" said the others; \"we will bring you food into  the lodge, and you will be our chief.\"    \"Very well,\" Grasshopper answered. He thought, \"I will stay here and  grow fat at their expense.\" But, soon after, one ran into the lodge, out  of breath, crying out, \"We are visited by the Indians!\"    All huddled together in great fear. The water began to lower, for the  hunters had broken down the dam, and they soon heard them on the roof of  the lodge, breaking it up. Out jumped all the beavers into the water,  and so escaped.    Grasshopper tried to follow them; but, unfortunately, to gratify his  ambition, they had made him so large that he could not creep out at the  hole. He tried to call them back, but either they did not hear or would  not attend to him; he worried himself so much in searching for a door to  let him out, that he looked like a great bladder, swollen and blistering  in the sun, and the sweat stood out upon his forehead in knobs and huge  bubbles.    Although he heard and understood every word that the hunters spoke--and  some of their expressions suggested terrible ideas--he could not turn  himself back into a man. He had chosen to be a beaver, and a beaver he  must be. One of the hunters, a prying little man, with a single lock  dangling over one eye--this inquisitive little fellow put his head in at  the top of the lodge. \"_Ty-au!_\" cried he. \"_Tut ty-au!_  Me-shau-mik--king of beavers is in.\" Whereupon the whole crowd of  hunters began upon him with their clubs, and knocked his scull about  until it was no harder than a morass in the middle of summer.  Grasshopper thought as well as ever he did, although he was a beaver;  and he felt that he was in a rather foolish scrape, inhabiting the  carcass of a beaver.    Presently seven or eight of the hunters hoisted his body upon long  poles, and marched away home with him. As they went, he reflected in  this manner: \"What will become of me? My ghost or shadow will not die  after they get me to their lodges.\"    Invitations were immediately sent out for a grand feast; but as soon as  his body got cold, his soul being uncomfortable in a house without heat,  flew off.    Having reassumed his mortal shape, Grasshopper found himself standing  near a prairie. After walking a distance, he saw a herd of elk feeding.  He admired their apparent ease and enjoyment of life, and thought there  could be nothing more pleasant than the liberty of running about and  feeding on the prairies. He had been a water animal and now he wished to  become a land animal, to learn what passed in an elk's head as he roved  about. He asked them if they could not turn him into one of themselves.    \"Yes,\" they answered, after a pause. \"Get down on your hands and feet.\"    He obeyed their directions, and forthwith found himself to be an elk.    \"I want big horns, big feet,\" said he; \"I wish to be very large;\" for  all the conceit and vain-glory had not been knocked out of Grasshopper,  even by the sturdy thwacks of the hunters' clubs.    \"Yes, yes,\" they answered. \"There,\" exerting their power, \"are you big  enough?\"    \"That will do,\" he replied; for, looking into a lake hard by,  Grasshopper saw that he was very large. They spent their time in grazing  and running to and fro; but what astonished Grasshopper, although he  often lifted up his head and directed his eyes that way, he could never  see the stars, which he had so admired as a human being.    Being rather cold, one day, Grasshopper went into a thick wood for  shelter, whither he was followed by most of the herd. They had not been  long there when some elks from behind passed the others like a strong  wind, calling out:    \"The hunters are after us!\"    All took the alarm, and off they ran, Grasshopper with the rest.    \"Keep out on the plains,\" they said. But it was too late to profit by  this advice, for they had already got entangled in the thick woods.  Grasshopper soon scented the hunters, who were closely following his  trail for they had left all the others and were making after him in  full cry. He jumped furiously, dashed through the underwood, and broke  down whole groves of saplings in his flight. But this only made it the  harder for him to get on, such a huge and lusty elk was he by his own  request.    Presently, as he dashed past an open space, he felt an arrow in his  side. They could not well miss it, he presented so wide a mark to the  shot. He bounded over trees under the smart, but the shafts clattered  thicker and thicker at his ribs, and at last one entered his heart. He  fell to the ground, and heard the whoop of triumph sounded by the  hunters. On coming up, they looked on the carcass with astonishment, and  with their hands up to their mouths, exclaimed: \"_Ty-au! ty-au!_\"    There were about sixty in the party, who had come out on a special hunt,  as one of their number had, the day before, observed his large tracks on  the plains. When they had skinned him his flesh grew cold, and his  spirit took its flight from the dead body, and Grasshopper found himself  in human shape, with a bow and arrows.    But his passion for adventure was not yet cooled; for on coming to a  large lake with a sandy beach, he saw a large flock of brant, and  speaking to them in the brant language, he requested them to make a  brant of him.    \"Yes,\" they replied, at once; for the brant is a bird of a very obliging  disposition.    \"But I want to be very large,\" he said. There was no end to the ambition  of little Grasshopper.    \"Very well,\" they answered; and he soon found himself a large brant, all  the others standing gazing in astonishment at his great size.    \"You must fly as leader,\" they said.    \"No,\" answered Grasshopper; \"I will fly behind.\"    \"Very well,\" rejoined the brant; \"one thing more we have to say to you,  brother Grasshopper\" (for he had told them his name). \"You must be  careful, in flying, not to look down, for something may happen to you.\"    \"Well, it is so,\" said he; and soon the flock rose up into the air, for  they were bound north. They flew very fast--he behind. One day, while  going with a strong wind, and as swift as their wings could flap, as  they passed over a large village the Indians raised a great shout on  seeing them, particularly on Grasshopper's account, for his wings were  broader than two large mats. The village people made such a frightful  noise that he forgot what had been told him about looking down. They  were now scudding along as swift as arrows; and as soon as he brought  his neck in and stretched it down to look at the shouters, his huge tail  was caught by the wind, and over and over he was blown. He tried to  right himself, but without success, for he had no sooner got out of one  heavy air-current than he fell into another, which treated him even more  rudely than that he had escaped from. Down, down he went, making more  turns than he wished for, from a height of several miles.    The first moment he had to look about him, Grasshopper, in the shape of  a big brant, was aware that he was jammed into a large hollow tree. To  get backward or forward was out of the question, and there, in spite of  himself, was Grasshopper forced to tarry till his brant life was ended  by starvation, when, his spirit being at liberty, he was once more a  human being.    As he journeyed on in search of further adventures, Grasshopper came to  a lodge in which were two old men, with heads white from extreme age.  They were very fine old men to look at. There was such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2225"],[0,"\"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks (#6)"],[1," steady undertune to the  \"click-nick\" of the knives in the pen; the wrench and schloop of torn  heads, dropped liver, and flying offal; the \"caraaah\" of Uncle  Salters's knife scooping away backbones; and the flap of wet, opened  bodies falling into the tub.    At the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest; for  fresh, wet cod weigh more than you would think, and his back ached with  the steady pitching. But he felt for the first time in his life that he  was one of a working gang of men, took pride in the thought, and held  on sullenly.    \"Knife oh!\" shouted Uncle Salters, at last. Penn doubled up, gasping  among the fish, Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself, and Long  Jack leaned over the bulwarks. The cook appeared, noiseless as a black  shadow, collected a mass of backbones and heads, and retreated.    \"Blood-ends for breakfast an' head-chowder,\" said Long Jack, smacking  his lips.    \"Knife oh!\" repeated Uncle Salters, waving the flat, curved splitter's  weapon.    \"Look by your foot, Harve,\" cried Dan, below.    Harvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing.  He dealt these around, taking over the dulled ones.    \"Water!\" said Disko Troop.    \"Scuttle-butt's for'ard, an' the dipper's alongside. Hurry, Harve,\"  said Dan.    He was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which  tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.    \"These are cod,\" said Disko. \"They ain't Damarskus figs, Tom Platt, nor  yet silver bars. I've told you that every single time sence we've  sailed together.\"    \"A matter o' seven seasons,\" returned Tom Platt, coolly. \"Good stowin's  good stowin' all the same, an' there's a right an' a wrong way o'  stowin' ballast even. If you'd ever seen four hundred ton o' iron set  into the--\"    \"Hi!\" With a yell from Manuel the work began again, and never stopped  till the pen was empty. The instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop  rolled aft to the cabin with his brother; Manuel and Long Jack went  forward; Tom Platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere  he too disappeared. In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the  cabin, and he was staring blankly at Dan and Penn.    \"I did a little better that time, Danny,\" said Penn, whose eyelids were  heavy with sleep. \"But I think it is my duty to help clean.\"    \"'Wouldn't hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal,\" said Dan. \"Turn  in, Penn. You've no call to do boy's work. Draw a bucket, Harvey. Oh,  Penn, dump these in the gurry-butt 'fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake  that long?\"    Penn took up the heavy basket of fish-livers, emptied them into a cask  with a hinged top lashed by the fo'c'sle; then he too dropped out of  sight in the cabin.    \"Boys clean up after dressin' down, an' first watch in ca'am weather is  boy's watch on the 'We're Here'.\" Dan sluiced the pen energetically,  unshipped the table, set it up to dry in the moonlight, ran the red  knife-blades through a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a  tiny grindstone, as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under  his direction.    At the first splash a silvery-white ghost rose bolt upright from the  oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started back with  a shout, but Dan only laughed. \"Grampus,\" said he. \"Beggin' fer  fish-heads. They up-eend thet way when they're hungry. Breath on him  like the doleful tombs, hain't he?\" A horrible stench of decayed fish  filled the air as the pillar of white sank, and the water bubbled  oilily. \"Hain't ye never seen a grampus up-eend before? You'll see 'em  by hundreds 'fore ye're through. Say, it's good to hev a boy aboard  again. Otto was too old, an' a Dutchy at that. Him an' me we fought  consid'ble. 'Wouldn't ha' keered fer thet ef he'd hed a Christian  tongue in his head. Sleepy?\"    \"Dead sleepy,\" said Harvey, nodding forward.    \"'Mustn't sleep on watch. Rouse up an' see ef our anchor-light's bright  an' shinin'. You're on watch now, Harve.\"    \"Pshaw! What's to hurt us? Bright's day. Sn-orrr!    \"Jest when things happen, dad says. Fine weather's good sleepin', an'  'fore you know, mebbe, you're cut in two by a liner, an' seventeen  brass-bound officers, all gen'elmen, lift their hand to it that your  lights was aout an' there was a thick fog. Harve, I've kinder took to  you, but ef you nod onct more I'll lay into you with a rope's end.\"    The moon, who sees many strange things on the Banks, looked down on a  slim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, staggering around the  cluttered decks of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him, waving a  knotted rope, walked, after the manner of an executioner, a boy who  yawned and nodded between the blows he dealt.    The lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly, the riding-sail slatted a  little in the shifts of the light wind, the windlass creaked, and the  miserable procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened,  whimpered, and at last wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on  his tongue, spoke of the beauty of watchfulness, and slashed away with  the rope's end, punishing the dories as often as he hit Harvey. At last  the clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the tenth stroke little  Penn crept on deck. He found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side  on the main-hatch, so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to  their berths.        CHAPTER III    It was the forty-fathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart,  and sends you to breakfast ravening. They emptied a big tin dish of  juicy fragments of fish--the blood-ends the cook had collected  overnight. They cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess, who  were out fishing, sliced pork for the midday meal, swabbed down the  fo'c'sle, filled the lamps, drew coal and water for the cook, and  investigated the fore-hold, where the boat's stores were stacked. It  was another perfect day--soft, mild, and clear; and Harvey breathed to  the very bottom of his lungs.    More schooners had crept up in the night, and the long blue seas were  full of sails and dories. Far away on the horizon, the smoke of some  liner, her hull invisible, smudged the blue, and to eastward a big  ship's topgallantsails, just lifting, made a square nick in it. Disko  Troop was smoking by the roof of the cabin--one eye on the craft  around, and the other on the little fly at the mainmast-head.    \"When dad kerflummoxes that way,\" said Dan, in a whisper, \"he's doin'  some high-line thinkin' fer all hands. I'll lay my wage an' share we'll  make berth soon. Dad he knows the cod, an' the fleet they know dad  knows. 'See 'em comin' up one by one, lookin' fer nothin' in  particular, o' course, but scrowgin' on us all the time? There's the  Prince Leboa; she's a Chat-ham boat. She's crep' up sence last night.  An' see that big one with a patch in her foresail an' a new jib? She's  the Carrie Pitman from West Chatham. She won't keep her canvas long on  less her luck's changed since last season. She don't do much 'cep'  drift. There ain't an anchor made'll hold her. . . . When the smoke  puffs up in little rings like that, dad's studyin' the fish. Ef we  speak to him now, he'll git mad. Las' time I did, he jest took an' hove  a boot at me.\"    Disko Troop stared forward, the pipe between his teeth, with eyes that  saw nothing. As his son said, he was studying the fish--pitting his  knowledge and experience on the Banks against the roving cod in his own  sea. He accepted the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the  horizon as a compliment to his powers. But now that it was paid, he  wished to draw away and make his berth alone, till it was time to go up  to the Virgin and fish in the streets of that roaring town upon the  waters. So Disko Troop thought of recent weather, and gales, currents,  food-supplies, and other domestic arrangements, from the point of view  of a twenty-pound cod; was, in fact, for an hour a cod himself, and  looked remarkably like one. Then he removed the pipe from his teeth.    \"Dad,\" said Dan, \"we've done our chores. Can't we go overside a piece?  It's good catch-in' weather.\"    \"Not in that cherry-coloured rig ner them ha'afbaked brown shoes. Give  him suthin' fit to wear.\"    \"Dad's pleased--that settles it,\" said Dan, delightedly, dragging  Harvey into the cabin, while Troop pitched a key down the steps. \"Dad  keeps my spare rig where he kin overhaul it, 'cause ma sez I'm  keerless.\" He rummaged through a locker, and in less than three minutes  Harvey was adorned with fisherman's rubber boots that came half up his  thigh, a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows, a pair of  flippers, and a sou'wester.    \"Naow ye look somethin' like,\" said Dan. \"Hurry!\"    \"Keep nigh an' handy,\" said Troop, \"an' don't go visitin' raound the  fleet. Ef any one asks you what I'm cal'latin' to do, speak the  truth--fer ye don't know.\"    A little red dory, labelled Hattie S., lay astern of the schooner. Dan  hauled in the painter, and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards,  while Harvey tumbled clumsily after.    \"That's no way o' gettin' into a boat,\" said Dan. \"Ef there was any sea  you'd go to the bottom, sure. You got to learn to meet her.\"    Dan fitted the thole-pins, took the forward thwart, and watched  Harvey's work. The boy had rowed, in a ladylike fashion, on the  Adirondack ponds; but there is a difference between squeaking pins and  well-balanced rowlocks--light sculls and stubby, eight-foot sea-oars.  They stuck in the gentle swell, and Harvey grunted.    \"Short! Row short!\" said Dan. \"Ef you cramp your oar in any kind o' sea  you're liable to turn her over. Ain't she a daisy? Mine, too.\"    The little dory was specklessly clean. In her bows lay a tiny anchor,  two jugs of water, and some seventy fathoms of thin, brown dory-roding.  A tin dinner-horn rested in cleats just under Harvey's right hand,  beside an ugly-looking maul, a short gaff, and a shorter wooden"]]]
