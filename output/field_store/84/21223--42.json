[Illustration: PLATE V. (Fig. 8.)]    The first tower of which we hear as built upon the earth, was certainly  built in a species of aspiration; but I do not suppose that any one here  will think it was a religious one. \"Go to now. Let us build a tower  whose top may reach unto heaven.\" From that day to this, whenever men  have become skillful architects at all, there has been a tendency in  them to build high; not in any religious feeling, but in mere exuberance  of spirit and power--as they dance or sing--with a certain mingling of  vanity--like the feeling in which a child builds a tower of cards; and,  in nobler instances, with also a strong sense of, and delight in the  majesty, height, and strength of the building itself, such as we have in  that of a lofty tree or a peaked mountain. Add to this instinct the  frequent necessity of points of elevation for watch-towers, or of points  of offense, as in towers built on the ramparts of cities, and, finally,  the need of elevations for the transmission of sound, as in the Turkish  minaret and Christian belfry, and you have, I think, a sufficient  explanation of the tower-building of the world in general. Look through  your Bibles only, and collect the various expressions with reference to  tower-building there, and you will have a very complete idea of the  spirit in which it is for the most part undertaken. You begin with that  of Babel; then you remember Gideon beating down the tower of Penuel, in  order more completely to humble the pride of the men of the city; you  remember the defense of the tower of Shechem against Abimelech, and the  death of Abimelech by the casting of a stone from it by a woman's hand;  you recollect the husbandman building a tower in his vineyard, and the  beautiful expressions in Solomon's song,--\"The tower of Lebanon, which  looketh towards Damascus;\" \"I am a wall, and my breasts like  towers;\"--you recollect the Psalmist's expressions of love and delight,  \"Go ye round about Jerusalem; tell the towers thereof: mark ye well her  bulwarks; consider her palaces, that ye may tell it to the generation  following.\" You see in all these cases how completely the tower is a  subject of human pride, or delight, or defense, not in any wise  associated with religious sentiment; the towers of Jerusalem being named  in the same sentence, not with her temple, but with her bulwarks and  palaces. And thus, when the tower is in reality connected with a place  of worship, it was generally done to add to its magnificence, but not to  add to its religious expression. And over the whole of the world, you  have various species of elevated buildings, the Egyptian pyramid, the  Indian and Chinese pagoda, the Turkish minaret, and the Christian  belfry,--all of them raised either to make a show from a distance, or to  cry from, or swing bells in, or hang them round, or for some other very  human reason. Thus, when the good people of Beauvais were building their  cathedral, that of Amiens, then just completed, had excited the  admiration of all France; and the people of Beauvais, in their jealousy  and determination to beat the people of Amiens, set to work to build a  tower to their own cathedral as high as they possibly could. They built  it so high that it tumbled down, and they were never able to finish  their cathedral at all--it stands a wreck to this day. But you will not,  I should think, imagine this to have been done in heavenward aspiration.  Mind, however, I don't blame the people of Beauvais, except for their  bad building. I think their desire to beat the citizens of Amiens a most  amiable weakness, and only wish I could see the citizens of Edinburgh  and Glasgow inflamed with the same emulation, building Gothic towers[7]  instead of manufactory chimneys. Only do not confound a feeling which,  though healthy and right, may be nearly analogous to that in which you  play a cricket-match, with any feeling allied to your hope of heaven.    [Footnote 7: I did not, at the time of the delivery of these lectures,  know how many Gothic towers the worthy Glaswegians _have_ lately built:  that of St. Peter's, in particular, being a most meritorious effort.]    20. Such being the state of the case with respect to tower-building in  general, let me follow for a few minutes the changes which occur in the  towers of northern and southern architects.    Many of us are familiar with the ordinary form of the Italian bell-tower  or campanile. From the eighth century to the thirteenth there was little  change in that form:[8] four-square, rising high and without tapering  into the air, story above story, they stood like giants in the quiet  fields beside the piles of the basilica or the Lombardic church, in this  form (_fig._ 9), tiled at the top in a flat gable, with open arches  below, and fewer and fewer arches on each inferior story, down to the  bottom. It is worth while noting the difference in form between these  and the towers built for military service. The latter were built as in  _fig._ 10, projecting vigorously at the top over a series of brackets or  machicolations, with very small windows, and no decoration below. Such  towers as these were attached to every important palace in the cities of  Italy, and stood in great circles--troops of towers--around their  external walls: their ruins still frown along the crests of every  promontory of the Apennines, and are seen from far away in the great  Lombardic plain, from distances of half-a-day's journey, dark against  the amber sky of the horizon. These are of course now built no more, the  changed methods of modern warfare having cast them into entire disuse;  but the belfry or campanile has had a very different influence on  European architecture. Its form in the plains of Italy and South France  being that just shown you, the moment we enter the valleys of the Alps,  where there is snow to be sustained, we find its form of roof altered by  the substitution of a steep gable for a flat one.[9] There are probably  few in the room who have not been in some parts of South Switzerland,  and who do not remember the beautiful effect of the gray mountain  churches, many of them hardly changed since the tenth and eleventh  centuries, whose pointed towers stand up through the green level of the  vines, or crown the jutting rocks that border the valley.    [Footnote 8: There is a good abstract of the forms of the Italian  campanile, by Mr. Papworth, in the Journal of the Archaeological  Institute, March 1850.]    [Footnote 9: The form establishes itself afterwards in the plains, in  sympathy with other Gothic conditions, as in the campanile of St. Mark's  at Venice.]    [Illustration: PLATE VI. (Fig. 10., Fig. 9.)]    21. From this form to the true spire the change is slight, and consists  in little more than various decoration; generally in putting small  pinnacles at the angles, and piercing the central pyramid with traceried  windows; sometimes, as at Fribourg and Burgos, throwing it into tracery  altogether: but to do this is invariably the sign of a vicious style, as  it takes away from the spire its character of a true roof, and turns it  nearly into an ornamental excrescence. At Antwerp and Brussels, the  celebrated towers (one, observe, ecclesiastical, being the tower of the  cathedral, and the other secular), are formed by successions of  diminishing towers, set one above the other, and each supported by  buttresses thrown to the angles of the one beneath. At the English  cathedrals of Lichfield and Salisbury, the spire is seen in great  purity, only decorated by sculpture; but I am aware of no example so  striking in its entire simplicity as that of the towers of the cathedral  of Coutances in Normandy. There is a dispute between French and English  antiquaries as to the date of the building, the English being unwilling  to admit its complete priority to all their own Gothic. I have no doubt  of this priority myself; and I hope that the time will soon come when  men will cease to confound vanity with patriotism, and will think the  honor of their nation more advanced by their own sincerity and courtesy,  than by claims, however learnedly contested, to the invention of  pinnacles and arches. I believe the French nation was, in the twelfth  and thirteenth centuries, the greatest in the world; and that the French  not only invented Gothic architecture, but carried it to a perfection  which no other nation has approached, then or since: but, however this  may be, there can be no doubt that the towers of Coutances, if not the  earliest, are among the very earliest, examples of the fully developed  spire. I have drawn one of them carefully for you (_fig._ 11), and you  will see immediately that they are literally domestic roofs, with garret  windows, executed on a large scale, and in stone. Their only ornament is  a kind of scaly mail, which is nothing more than the copying in stone of  the common wooden shingles of the house-roof; and their security is  provided for by strong gabled dormer windows, of massy masonry, which,  though supported on detached shafts, have weight enough completely to  balance the lateral thrusts of the spires. Nothing can surpass the  boldness or the simplicity of the plan; and yet, in spite of this  simplicity, the clear detaching of the shafts from the slope of the  spire, and their great height, strengthened by rude cross-bars of stone,  carried back to the wall behind, occasion so great a complexity and play  of cast shadows, that I remember no architectural composition of  which the aspect is so completely varied at different hours of the  day.[10] But the main thing I wish you to observe is, the complete  _domesticity_ of the work; the evident treatment of the church spire  merely as a magnified house-roof; and the proof herein of the great  truth of which I have been endeavoring to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#6)"],[1,". But we do not  notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads.\"    He had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down  through the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and  angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.    \"The Monkey-People are forbidden,\" said Baloo, \"forbidden to the  Jungle-People. Remember.\"    \"Forbidden,\" said Bagheera, \"but I still think Baloo should have warned  thee against them.\"    \"I--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey  People! Faugh!\"    A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking  Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly  true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look  up, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross  each other's path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded  tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks  and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then  they would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People  to climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles  over nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the  Jungle-People could see them. They were always just going to have a  leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because  their memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they  compromised things by making up a saying, \"What the Bandar-log think now  the jungle will think later,\" and that comforted them a great deal. None  of the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts  would notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli  came to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was.    They never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at  all; but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea, and  he told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in  the tribe, because he could weave sticks together for protection from  the wind; so, if they caught him, they could make him teach them.  Of course Mowgli, as a woodcutter's child, inherited all sorts of  instincts, and used to make little huts of fallen branches without  thinking how he came to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees,  considered his play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were  really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the  jungle--so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them. Therefore  they followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very  quietly till it was time for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was  very much ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear,  resolving to have no more to do with the Monkey People.    The next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and  arms--hard, strong, little hands--and then a swash of branches in his  face, and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo  woke the jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk  with every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled  away to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting:  \"He has noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us. All the Jungle-People  admire us for our skill and our cunning.\" Then they began their flight;  and the flight of the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of  the things nobody can describe. They have their regular roads and  crossroads, up hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty to seventy  or a hundred feet above ground, and by these they can travel even at  night if necessary. Two of the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under  the arms and swung off with him through the treetops, twenty feet at a  bound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast, but the  boy's weight held them back. Sick and giddy as Mowgli was he could not  help enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down below  frightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing  over nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth. His  escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost  branches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a whoop  would fling themselves into the air outward and downward, and bring  up, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next  tree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green  jungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea,  and then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face, and he  and his two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and  crashing and whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept  along the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.    For a time he was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew  better than to struggle, and then he began to think. The first thing was  to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys  were going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless  to look down, for he could only see the topsides of the branches, so he  stared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing  and wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die.  Rann saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a  few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He  whistled with surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop  and heard him give the Kite call for--\"We be of one blood, thou and I.\"  The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to  the next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again. \"Mark  my trail!\" Mowgli shouted. \"Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera  of the Council Rock.\"    \"In whose name, Brother?\" Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of  course he had heard of him.    \"Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!\"    The last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but  Rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust,  and there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the  treetops as Mowgli's escort whirled along.    \"They never go far,\" he said with a chuckle. \"They never do what they  set out to do. Always pecking at new things are the Bandar-log. This  time, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for  themselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill  more than goats.\"    So he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and waited.    Meantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera  climbed as he had never climbed before, but the thin branches broke  beneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws full of bark.    \"Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?\" he roared to poor Baloo, who had  set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys. \"What  was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him?\"    \"Haste! O haste! We--we may catch them yet!\" Baloo panted.    \"At that speed! It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the  Law--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee  open. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is no time for chasing.  They may drop him if we follow too close.\"    \"Arrula! Whoo! They may have dropped him already, being tired of  carrying him. Who can trust the Bandar-log? Put dead bats on my head!  Give me black bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the wild bees  that I may be stung to death, and bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most  miserable of bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli, Mowgli! Why did I not  warn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head? Now  perhaps I may have knocked the day's lesson out of his mind, and he will  be alone in the jungle without the Master Words.\"    Baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning.    \"At least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago,\" said  Bagheera impatiently. \"Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect. What  would the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like  Ikki the Porcupine, and howled?\"    \"What do I care what the jungle thinks? He may be dead by now.\"    \"Unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport, or kill him  out of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub. He is wise and well  taught, and above all he has the eyes that make the Jungle-People  afraid. But (and it is a great evil) he is in the power of the  Bandar-log, and they, because they live in trees, have no fear of any of  our people.\" Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully.    \"Fool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I am,\" said  Baloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk, \"it is true what Hathi the Wild  Elephant says: `To each his own fear'; and they, the Bandar-log, fear  Kaa the Rock Snake. He can climb as well as they can. He steals the  young monkeys in the night. The whisper of his name makes their wicked  tails cold. Let us go to Kaa.\"    \"What will he do for us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and  with most evil eyes,\" said Bagheera.    \"He is very old and very cunning. Above all, he is always hungry,\" said  Baloo hopefully. \"Promise him many goats.\"    \"He sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep  now, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats?\"  Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.    \"Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see  reason.\" Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the Panther,  and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.    They found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun,  admiring his beautiful new coat, for he had been in retirement"]]]
