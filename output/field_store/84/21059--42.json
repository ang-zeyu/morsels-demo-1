[Illustration: EDINGDON'S WINDOWS IN NORTH-WEST BAYS.  North West Bay.  Winchester Cathedral.  H.P. Clifford    From a Drawing by H.P. Clifford.]    The original west front may very probably have been similar to that of  Lincoln Cathedral, \"unornamental,\" says a writer in _Architecture_,  \"save for some interlacing arches and dwarf blind arcades, and with no  windows to reflect the setting sun, or to light the cavernous interior.\"    The two westernmost bays of the #North side# are due to Edingdon, and we  get here well contrasted the work of Edingdon and of Wykeham. In  Willis's plan the difference can be clearly seen. The two windows to the  right are heavier, lower, and broader, and display much deeper exterior  mouldings, with \"a most cavernous and gloomy appearance,\" while the  window on the left hand is much narrower and lighter. The left-hand  buttress is like the others on the north side of the church, whereas the  other three are different from it and from one another, that on the  extreme right, together with its pinnacle, being apparently just as  Edingdon left it. The pinnacles and upper set-off of the two centre  buttresses in the figure were added by Wykeham to Edingdon's underwork.  The mouldings of Wykeham's windows are more elaborate than those of  Edingdon's, where the tracery is similar to that of the west window. Of  the bays on the north side the nine next to Edingdon's two, together  with the three beyond the northern transept, are Wykeham's work, as are  the three bays beyond the transept on the southern side and the  extension of the Lady Chapel. Edingdon claims, beside what has been  already mentioned, one bay on the south, next the west front. De Lucy's  work consists of the three easterly bays on either side, and part of the  Lady Chapel exterior. The rest of the bays are Norman, and the  prevailing note is simplicity, not to say rudeness. The #South side# of  the nave is almost devoid of decoration, the bays being merely divided  by flat buttresses which do not reach below the bottoms of the aisle  windows. The eleven windows in the clerestory above are all alike,  divided only by flat buttresses. Aisle and clerestory both show a plain  parapet and corbels. The bold buttresses on the north side, with their  panelled and crocketted pinnacles, save it from the monotony of the  south side, which, however, was once greatly concealed by cloisters and  convent buildings, and is even now far more enclosed than the northern  side.    The low #Central Tower#, the coping of which is only 35 feet above the  ridge of the transept roof, is Norman, though, as explained before, of  later date than the transepts. It is of a simple square form, 150 feet  high by 50 wide, and is divided by a string course into two storeys, the  lower of which is plain with small round-headed windows; the larger  upper storey has on each side three narrow round-headed windows, which  form a kind of arcade round the upper part of the tower, surmounted by a  zig-zag string course. At the angles are engaged shafts. The massive  manner in which the tower was rebuilt in the eleventh century can be  better appreciated from within, when we come to the piers which support  it. The building has been said to prove that the Normans of the period  were \"still bad masons and imperfectly acquainted with the principles of  construction,\" the masses of masonry employed showing an enormous waste  of both labour and materials. But the architects at any rate gained  their end, since the tower has stood to the present day. The strength of  the original Norman work, indeed, is so great that for all the 250 feet  of nave no flying-buttresses were required to support the later  vaulting.    The gables of the #Transepts# are not so high as those of the nave, but  the clerestory parapets are on the same level. The side aisles are much  lower than those in the nave or the presbytery. The parapets are plain,  over a series of small arches supported by corbels; except that in the  eastern aisle of the south transept the parapet rests on plain corbels,  and above the western clerestory of the other transept is a cornice with  Perpendicular bosses. In this clerestory, again, the buttresses are  Perpendicular, whereas otherwise throughout the transepts they are flat  Norman. Over the eastern aisle of the north there is no cornice or  corbel; \"the parapet,\" says Woodward, \"with no more than a water-table  under it, is carried across the gable of the north transept, so as to  form an _alura_ above the buttress, in front of the circular window  there.\" The Perpendicular rose-window in the northern gable cannot now  be seen from the interior, being hidden by the transept ceiling, but in  the illustration from _Britton_, on page 59, it is visible. The  corresponding gable on the south shows panelling with interlacing Norman  arches, but there are only two narrow lights. Many symptoms show that  square towers were to have been erected flanking the transept gables.  There is an unfinished turret at the north-east corner of the north  transept, while the springing of an arcade and the generally incomplete  appearance prove that a side tower was intended. The other three extreme  angles of the transepts also bear out this view. The width from east to  west of the transepts is enormous as compared with the height of the  central tower above. It rather looks from the presence (barely  perceptible from outside) of the westernmost windows of the presbytery  aisles as if those who carried on Wykeham's work had meant to reduce  this great width, and give more importance to the presbytery and  retro-choir externally. It is certain, at any rate, that the Norman  transepts narrowly escaped a complete transformation. That on the north  side of the cathedral shows very considerable alterations, in the  majority of its windows, from the old Norman pattern. A built-up doorway  may be noticed under the first window from the west of this transept.    The exterior of the #Presbytery# has only three compartments on each  side, but in each there are four lights in aisle and clerestory alike.  The windows are of the Wykeham pattern, though probably a little later  in date than his work. The buttresses, which rise above the aisle roof,  culminate in square panelled pinnacles, surmounted by crocketted ogee  canopies. From these buttresses spring graceful flying-buttresses, with  pierced spandrels running to the clerestory walls. On the northern side  the plain parapet has over it a pierced battlement.    The #East End#, as it now stands, is some 110 feet beyond the original  Norman termination, and presents a square face, projecting with a flat  parapet beyond the high gable over the actual east window. The Norman  apse was demolished about 1320 in all probability, and the present  polygonal end substituted for it. It seems that originally the aisles of  the Norman presbytery continued round this apse, which was flanked by  two small towers. The eastern chapel may have been dedicated to the Holy  Trinity as at Canterbury, and probably extended as far as the western  arch of the present Lady Chapel. The central gable of the old  termination, rather acute in form, is richly decorated with panels and  crocketting, and is crowned by a tabernacle wherein Bishop Fox is  represented leaning on the pelican. \"Three of the panels in the centre  are pierced and glazed, forming a small square-headed window; and under  it is a door opening upon an _alura_, behind a crenelated, panelled, and  pierced parapet, over a cornice with bosses, at the base of the gable,  and just above the east window\" (Woodward). The Perpendicular east  window has seven lights, and resembles, in the form of its head,  Wykeham's windows. A portrait bust of Fox has been discovered on the  north corbel of the hood-mould of this window, and the flying-buttresses  (which, as Willis pointed out, the jointing of the masonry proves to be  later insertions into the clerestory walls) have the pelican carved on  them. The whole gable is flanked by richly canopied octagonal turrets,  on which the flying-buttresses abut. The lower part of the east window  cannot be seen from below, being lost behind the roof of the chantry  aisles.    [Illustration: THE EAST END--EXTERIOR. _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    The whole of the eastern arm of the cathedral is curiously mixed in  style, furnishing examples of Early English, Decorated, and  Perpendicular architecture. Beyond the main east gable just described  projects a low Early English structure of three nearly equally high  aisles, of which the central or Lady Chapel has received a further  Perpendicular addition. There has been apparently a slight subsidence of  the Early English walls, which has caused the irregular look of the  arches in the interior of the southern retro-choir aisle (see page 69).  Above the plain string-course of the retro-choir there is in each  compartment, under a level parapet, an arcade of narrow pointed arches,  four in number, the central couple of each set being pierced and glazed,  so as to form pairs of lancet windows. The Langton and Guardian Angels'  chapels, which project not quite half as far as the Lady Chapel from the  old eastern limit of the church, show a triple series of arcades,  diminishing in size as they mount. The central arcade is much cut into  on the eastern face by the large three-light windows of the lateral  chapels. There is no parapet above the arcades. At the angles between  these chapels and the retro-choir aisles are staircases enclosed in  small octagonal turrets rising slightly above the adjoining parts with  merely a plain parapet at the top.    The #Lady Chapel# has at the end and at each side a fine seven-light  Perpendicular window, the heads of the lights below the transom being  cinquefoiled, while above each window is a cornice supported by small  arches resting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#6)"],[1," their mounts. As has been said,  special accommodations had been erected where they were to stay during  the weeks they would be needed. There were more men than women among the  extra people, though a number of women and girls were needed in the  \"town\" scenes.    Most of the men were former members of the militia, cowboys and  adventurers, all of whom were used to hard, rough riding. This was  necessary, for when battle scenes are shown there must be some \"killed,\"  and when a man has a horse shot from under him, or is shot himself,  riding at full speed, even though the cartridges are blank, the action  calls for a heavy fall, sudden and abrupt, to make it look real. And  this is not easy to do, nor is it altogether safe with a mob of riders  thundering along behind one.    Yet the men who take part in these battle scenes do it with scarcely a  thought of danger, though often many of them are hurt, as are the  horses.    In brief the story of the play in which Ruth was to take the part of a  girl in Blue, and Alice of a girl in Gray, was this. They were cousins,  and Ruth was visiting Alice's home in the South when the war broke out.  Alice, of course, sided with her people, and loved the gray uniforms,  while Ruth's sympathies were with the North.    Ruth determined to go back North and become a nurse, while Alice,  longing for more active work, offered her services as a spy to help the  Confederacy. Though on opposite sides, the girls' love for one another  did not wane.    Then came the scenes of the war. Battles were to be shown, and there  were plots and counter-plots, in some of which Ruth and Alice had no  part. Mr. DeVere was cast for a Northern General, and the character  became him well. Later on Alice and Ruth were to meet in a hospital  among the wounded. Alice was supposed to get certain papers of value to  her side from a wounded Union officer. As she was escaping with them  Ruth was to intercept her, and the two were to have a \"strong\" scene  together.    Alice, ignoring the pleadings of her cousin and about to depart with  the papers, learns that the officer from whom she took them was the same  one that had saved her father's life on the battlefield. She decides to  forego her mission as a spy, even though it may mean the betrayal of her  own cause, when the news comes in of Lee's surrender, and her sacrifice  is not demanded. Then \"all live happily for ever after.\"    That is but a mere outline of the play, which was to be an elaborate  production. And it was the rehearsal for the preliminary battles and  skirmishes that the girls were now witnessing.    \"Tell that battery to get ready to fire!\" cried Mr. Pertell, and this  word went over the telephone.    \"Come on now with that Union charge!\" was the next command.    Then hundreds of horses thundered down the slopes of Oak Farm, while the  hidden guns thundered. Down went horses and men while the girls screamed  involuntarily, it all seemed so real.    \"It's a good thing we didn't plant no corn in that there field this  season,\" observed Belix Apgar, Sandy's father, as he saw the charge.    \"That's right,\" agreed his wife. \"There wouldn't have been 'nuff left to  make a hominy cake.\"    \"Do it over again!\" ordered the manager. \"Some of you fellows ride your  horses as if you were going to a croquet game. Get some action into it!\"    Once more the battery thundered its harmless shots and the men charged.  This time the scene was satisfactory, and preparations were made to film  it. Again the men thundered down the slope, and when they were almost at  the battery a single rider--a girl--dashed out toward the approaching  Union soldiers.    \"Oh, she'll be killed!\" cried Ruth. \"They'll ride right over her!\"    It did seem so, for she was headed straight toward the approaching  horsemen.    \"She's all right,\" said Paul. \"She's quite a rider, I believe. Her part,  as a Union sympathizer, is to rush out and warn them of the hidden  battery, but she is delayed by a Southerner until it is too late, and  she takes a desperate chance. There go the guns!\"    Horses and riders were lost in a cloud of smoke. This time the film was  being taken. When that charge was over, and men and horses, some  limping, had gone back to their quarters, Mr. Pertell signaled to the  daring woman rider to come to him.    \"That was very well done, Miss Brown,\" he said. \"You certainly showed  nerve.\"    \"I am glad you liked it,\" was the answer in a quiet, well-bred voice.  \"Shall you want me again to-day?\"    \"Not until later, and it will be an interior. Is your horse all right?\"    \"Oh, yes. I am in love with him!\" and she patted the arching neck of the  handsome creature. \"He is so speedy.\"    \"He sure is speedy, all right,\" agreed Paul, and the girl--she was  scarcely more than that--who had been addressed as Miss Brown by the  director smiled at the young actor. Then she let her friendly gaze rest  on Ruth and Alice.    \"Isn't she fine!\" murmured Alice.    \"Like to meet her?\" whispered Paul.    \"Yes!\" exclaimed Alice eagerly, paying no attention to Ruth's plucking  of her sleeve.    \"Miss Brown, allow me to present----\" and Paul introduced the two DeVere  girls.    \"That was a daring ride of yours!\" remarked Alice, with enthusiasm.    \"Indeed it was,\" agreed Ruth, more quietly.    \"Do you think so? I'm glad you like it. I have been riding ever since I  was a little girl.\"    \"Did you learn in the West?\" asked Alice.    \"Why, yes--that is I--I really--oh, there goes that wild black horse  again!\" and Miss Brown turned to point to an animal ridden by one of  the Confederate soldiers. The horse seemed unmanageable, and dashed  some distance across the field before it was brought under control.    Then the talk turned to moving picture work, though Ruth could not help  wondering, even in the midst of it, why Miss Brown had not been more  certain of where she had learned to ride.    \"It isn't something one would forget,\" mused Ruth.          CHAPTER VI    A NEEDED LESSON      Rehearsals, the filming of scenes, retakes and the studying of their  parts kept busy not only the moving picture girls, but all the members  of Mr. Pertell's company. There was work for all, and from the smallest  girls and boys, including Tommie and Nellie Maguire, to Mr. DeVere  himself, little spare time was to be had.    Ruth and Alice had important parts, and they were given a general  outline of what was expected of them. They would be in many scenes, and  a variety of action would be required. In order that they do themselves  and the film justice, since they were to be \"featured,\" the girls spent  much time studying in their rooms and practising to get the best results  from the various registerings.    \"That is going to be a very strong scene for you and Alice,\" said Mr.  DeVere to Ruth one day. \"I refer to that scene where Alice takes the  paper and afterwards discovers the identity of the man to whom she owes  so much--the life of her father. Now let me see how you would play it,  Alice.\"    Alice did so, and she did well, but her father was not satisfied. The  stage traditions meant much to him, and though he had been forced to  give up many of them when he went into the motion pictures, still he  knew what good dramatic action was, and he knew that it would \"get over\"  just as certainly in the silent drama as it did in the legitimate. So he  made Alice go over the scene again, and Ruth also, until he was  satisfied.    \"Now, when the time comes, you'll know how to do it,\" he said. \"Don't be  satisfied with anything but the best you can do, even if it is only a  moving picture show. I am convinced, more and more, that the silent  drama is going to take a larger place than ever before the public.\"    It was on one afternoon following a rather hard day's work before the  cameras, that Ruth and Alice, with Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon, sat  on the porch of the farmhouse, waiting for the supper bell. Russ and  Paul were off to one side, talking, and Mr. DeVere and Mr. Bunn were  discussing their early days in the legitimate. Mr. Pertell came up the  walk, a worried look on his face, seeing which Mr. Switzer called out:    \"Did a cow step on some of the actors, Herr Director, or did one of our  worthy farmer's rams knock over a camera after it had filmed one of the  battle scenes?\"    \"Neither one, Mr. Switzer,\" was the answer. \"This is merely a domestic  trouble I have on my mind.\"    \"Domestic!\" exclaimed Alice. \"You don't mean that some of your pretty  extra girls have eloped with some of your dashing cowboy soldiers, do  you? I wouldn't blame them if they----\"    \"Alice!\" chided her sister.    \"Oh, well, you know what I mean!\"    \"No, it isn't quite that,\" laughed the director, \"though you have very  nearly hit it,\" and he took a chair near Alice and her sister, and near  where Pearl Pennington and Laura Dixon were rocking and chewing gum.    \"Tell us, and perhaps we can help you,\" Alice suggested.    \"Well, maybe you can. It's about Miss Estelle Brown, the young lady who  made that daring ride in front of the masked battery the other day.\"    \"What! Has she left?\" asked Ruth. \"She was such a wonderful rider!\"    \"No, she hasn't left, but she threatens to; and I can't let her go, as  she's in some of the films and I'd have to switch the whole plot around  to explain why she didn't come in on the later scenes.\"    \"Why is she going to leave?\" Alice queried.    \"Because she has been subjected to some annoyance on the part of a young  man who is one of the extras. You know the extras all live down in the  big bungalow I had built for them. I have a man and his wife to look  after them, and I try to make it as nearly like a happy family as I can.  But Miss Brown says she can't stay there any longer. This young man--a  decent enough chap he had seemed to me--is pestering her with his  attentions. He is quite in love with her, it seems.\"    \"Oh, how romantic!\" gurgled Miss Dixon.    \"Miss"]]]
