In the British army \"brevet rank\" exists only  above the rank of captain, but in the United States army it is possible to  obtain a brevet as first lieutenant. In France the term _brevete_ is  particularly used with respect to the General Staff, to express the  equivalent of the English \"passed Staff College\" (p.s.c.).    BREVIARY (Lat. _breviarium_, abridgment, epitome), the book which contains  the offices for the canonical hours, _i.e._ the daily service of the Roman  Catholic Church. As compared with the Anglican Book of Common Prayer it is  both more and less comprehensive; more, in that it includes lessons and  hymns for every day in the year; less, because it excludes the Eucharistic  office (contained in the Missal), and the special offices connected with  baptism, marriage, burial, ordination, &c., which are found in the Ritual  or the Pontifical. In the early days of Christian worship, when Jewish  custom was followed, the Bible furnished all that was thought necessary,  containing as it did the books from which the lessons were read and the  psalms that were recited. The first step in the evolution of the Breviary  was the separation of the Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president  of the local church (bishop) or the leader of the choir chose a particular  psalm as he thought appropriate. From about the 4th century certain psalms  began to be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic  practice of daily reciting the 150 psalms. This took so much time that the  monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours, and  allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the 6th  century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not certainly, on the  basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is the one  in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter choir-books  additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or short prayers,  for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and metrical  compositions. Jean Beleth, a 12th-century liturgical author, gives the  following list of books necessary for the right conduct of the canonical  office:--the _Antiphonarium_, the Old and New Testaments, the  _Passionarius_ (_liber_) and the _Legendarius_ (dealing respectively with  martyrs and saints), the _Homiliarius_ (homilies on the Gospels), the  _Sermologus_ (collection of sermons) and the works of the Fathers, besides,  of course, the _Psalterium_ and the _Collectarium_. To overcome the  inconvenience of using such a library the Breviary came into existence and  use. Already in the 8th century Prudentius, bishop of Troyes, had in a  _Breviarium Psalterii_ made an abridgment of the Psalter for the laity,  giving a few psalms for each day, and Alcuin had rendered a similar service  by including a prayer for each day and some other prayers, but no lessons  or homilies. The Breviary rightly so called, however, only dates from the  11th century; the earliest MS. containing the whole canonical office is of  the year 1099 and is in the Mazarin library. Gregory VII. (pope 1073-1085),  too, simplified the liturgy as performed at the Roman court, and gave his  abridgment the name of Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which  from another point of view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did  the collection of several works into one. There are several extant  specimens of 12th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent  III. (pope 1198-1216) their use was extended, especially by the newly  founded and active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the  authorization of Gregory IX., adopted (with some modifications, _e.g._ the  substitution of the \"Gallican\" for the \"Roman\" version of the Psalter) the  Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it  gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books (Legendaries,  Responsories), &c., and to some extent the local Breviaries, like that of  Sarum. Finally, Nicholas III. (pope 1277-1280) adopted this version both  for the curia and for the basilicas of Rome, and thus made its position  secure. The Benedictines and Dominicans have Breviaries of their own. The  only other types that merit notice are:--(1) the Mozarabic Breviary, once  in use throughout all Spain, but now confined to a single foundation at  Toledo; it is remarkable for the number and length of its hymns, and for  the fact that the majority of its collects are addressed to God the Son;  (2) the Ambrosian, now confined to Milan, where it owes its retention to  the attachment of the clergy and people to their traditionary rites, which  they derive from St Ambrose (see LITURGY).    [v.04 p.0504] Till the council of Trent every bishop had full power to  regulate the Breviary of his own diocese; and this was acted upon almost  everywhere. Each monastic community, also, had one of its own. Pius V.  (pope 1566-1572), however, while sanctioning those which could show at  least 200 years of existence, made the Roman obligatory in all other  places. But the influence of the court of Rome has gradually gone much  beyond this, and has superseded almost all the local \"uses.\" The Roman has  thus become nearly universal, with the allowance only of additional offices  for saints specially venerated in each particular diocese. The Roman  Breviary has undergone several revisions: The most remarkable of these is  that by Francis Quignonez, cardinal of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (1536),  which, though not accepted by Rome,[1] formed the model for the still more  thorough reform made in 1549 by the Church of England, whose daily morning  and evening services are but a condensation and simplification of the  Breviary offices. Some parts of the prefaces at the beginning of the  English Prayer-Book are free translations of those of Quignonez. The Pian  Breviary was again altered by Sixtus V. in 1588, who introduced the revised  Vulgate text; by Clement VIII. in 1602 (through Baronius and Bellarmine),  especially as concerns the rubrics; and by Urban VIII. (1623-1644), a  purist who unfortunately tampered with the text of the hymns, injuring both  their literary charm and their historic worth.    In the 17th and 18th centuries a movement of revision took place in France,  and succeeded in modifying about half the Breviaries of that country.  Historically, this proceeded from the labours of Jean de Launoy  (1603-1678), \"le denicheur des saints,\" and Louis Sebastien le Nain de  Tillemont, who had shown the falsity of numerous lives of the saints; while  theologically it was produced by the Port Royal school, which led men to  dwell more on communion with God as contrasted with the invocation of the  saints. This was mainly carried out by the adoption of a rule that all  antiphons and responses should be in the exact words of Scripture, which,  of course, cut out the whole class of appeals to created beings. The  services were at the same time simplified and shortened, and the use of the  whole Psalter every week (which had become a mere theory in the Roman  Breviary, owing to its frequent supersession by saints' day services) was  made a reality. These reformed French Breviaries--_e.g._ the Paris Breviary  of 1680 by Archbishop Francois de Harlay (1625-1695) and that of 1736 by  Archbishop Charles Gaspard Guillaume de Vintimille (1655-1746)--show a deep  knowledge of Holy Scripture, and much careful adaptation of different  texts; but during the pontificate of Pius IX. a strong Ultramontane  movement arose against them. This was inaugurated by Montalembert, but its  literary advocates were chiefly Dom Gueranger, a learned Benedictine monk,  abbot of Solesmes, and Louis Francois Veuillot (1813-1883) of the  _Univers_; and it succeeded in suppressing them everywhere, the last  diocese to surrender being Orleans in 1875. The Jansenist and Gallican  influence was also strongly felt in Italy and in Germany, where Breviaries  based on the French models were published at Cologne, Muenster, Mainz and  other towns. Meanwhile, under the direction of Benedict XIV. (pope  1740-1758), a special congregation collected many materials for an official  revision, but nothing was published. Subsequent changes have been very few  and minute. In 1902, under Leo XIII., a commission under the presidency of  Monsignor Louis Duchesne was appointed to consider the Breviary, the  Missal, the Pontifical and the Ritual.    The beauty and value of many of the Latin Breviaries were brought to the  notice of English churchmen by one of the numbers of the Oxford _Tracts for  the Times_, since which time they have been much more studied, both for  their own sake and for the light they throw upon the English Prayer-Book.    From a bibliographical point of view some of the early printed Breviaries  are among the rarest of literary curiosities, being merely local. The  copies were not spread far, and were soon worn out by the daily use made of  them. Doubtless many editions have perished without leaving a trace of  their existence, while others are known by unique copies. In Scotland the  only one which has survived the convulsions of the 16th century is that of  Aberdeen, a Scottish form of the Sarum Office,[2] revised by William  Elphinstone (bishop 1483-1514), and printed at Edinburgh by Walter Chapman  and Andrew Myllar in 1509-1510. Four copies have been preserved of it, of  which only one is complete; but it was reprinted in facsimile in 1854 for  the Bannatyne Club by the munificence of the duke of Buccleuch. It is  particularly valuable for the trustworthy notices of the early history of  Scotland which are embedded in the lives of the national saints.

Others there had been who had felt its touch, who had been  drawn to the heart of the unclean labyrinth--and devoured. In the mind  of Cairn, the figure of Antony Ferrara assumed the shape of a monster,  a ghoul, an elemental spirit of evil.    And now he was ascending the marble steps. Before the gates of the  lift he stood and pressed the bell.    Ferrara's proved to be a first-floor suite, and the doors were opened  by an Eastern servant dressed in white.    \"His beastly theatrical affectation again!\" muttered Cairn. \"The man  should have been a music-hall illusionist!\"    The visitor was salaamed into a small reception room. Of this  apartment the walls and ceiling were entirely covered by a fretwork in  sandalwood, evidently Oriental in workmanship. In niches, or doorless  cup-boards; stood curious-looking vases and pots. Heavy curtains of  rich fabric draped the doors. The floor was of mosaic, and a small  fountain played in the centre. A cushioned divan occupied one side of  the place, from which natural light was entirely excluded and which  was illuminated only by an ornate lantern swung from the ceiling. This  lantern had panes of blue glass, producing a singular effect. A silver  _mibkharah_, or incense-burner, stood near to one corner of the divan  and emitted a subtle perfume. As the servant withdrew:    \"Good heavens!\" muttered Cairn, disgustedly; \"poor Sir Michael's  fortune won't last long at this rate!\" He glanced at the smoking  _mibkharah_. \"Phew! effeminate beast! Ambergris!\"    No more singular anomaly could well be pictured than that afforded by  the lean, neatly-groomed Scotsman, with his fresh, clean-shaven face  and typically British air, in this setting of Eastern voluptuousness.    The dusky servitor drew back a curtain and waved him to enter, bowing  low as the visitor passed. Cairn found himself in Antony Ferrara's  study. A huge fire was blazing in the grate, rendering the heat of the  study almost insufferable.    It was, he perceived, an elaborated copy of Ferrara's room at Oxford;  infinitely more spacious, of course, and by reason of the rugs,  cushions and carpets with which its floor was strewn, suggestive of  great opulence. But the littered table was there, with its nameless  instruments and its extraordinary silver lamp; the mummies were there;  the antique volumes, rolls of papyrus, preserved snakes and cats and  ibises, statuettes of Isis, Osiris and other Nile deities were there;  the many photographs of women, too (Cairn had dubbed it at Oxford \"the  zenana\"); above all, there was Antony Ferrara.    He wore the silver-grey dressing-gown trimmed with white swansdown in  which Cairn had seen him before. His statuesque ivory face was set in  a smile, which yet was no smile of welcome; the over-red lips smiled  alone; the long, glittering dark eyes were joyless; almost, beneath  the straightly-pencilled brows, sinister. Save for the short,  lustreless hair it was the face of a handsome, evil woman.    \"My dear Cairn--what a welcome interruption. How good of you!\"    There was strange music in his husky tones. He spoke unemotionally,  falsely, but Cairn could not deny the charm of that unique voice. It  was possible to understand how women--some women--would be as clay in  the hands of the man who had such a voice as that.    His visitor nodded shortly. Cairn was a poor actor; already his _role_  was oppressing him. Whilst Ferrara was speaking one found a sort of  fascination in listening, but when he was silent he repelled. Ferrara  may have been conscious of this, for he spoke much, and well.    \"You have made yourself jolly comfortable,\" said Cairn.    \"Why not, my dear Cairn? Every man has within him something of the  Sybarite. Why crush a propensity so delightful? The Spartan philosophy  is palpably absurd; it is that of one who finds himself in a garden  filled with roses and who holds his nostrils; who perceives there  shady bowers, but chooses to burn in the sun; who, ignoring the choice  fruits which tempt his hand and court his palate, stoops to pluck  bitter herbs from the wayside!\"    \"I see!\" snapped Cairn. \"Aren't you thinking of doing any more work,  then?\"    \"Work!\" Antony Ferrara smiled and sank upon a heap of cushions.  \"Forgive me, Cairn, but I leave it, gladly and confidently, to more  robust characters such as your own.\"    He proffered a silver box of cigarettes, but Cairn shook his head,  balancing himself on a corner of the table.    \"No; thanks. I have smoked too much already; my tongue is parched.\"    \"My dear fellow!\" Ferrara rose. \"I have a wine which, I declare, you  will never have tasted but which you will pronounce to be nectar. It  is made in Cyprus--\"    Cairn raised his hand in a way that might have reminded a nice  observer of his father.    \"Thank you, nevertheless. Some other time, Ferrara; I am no wine man.\"    \"A whisky and soda, or a burly British B. and S., even a sporty  'Scotch and Polly'?\"    There was a suggestion of laughter in the husky voice, now, of a sort  of contemptuous banter. But Cairn stolidly shook his head and forced a  smile.    \"Many thanks; but it's too early.\"    He stood up and began to walk about the room, inspecting the  numberless oddities which it contained. The photographs he examined  with supercilious curiosity. Then, passing to a huge cabinet, he began  to peer in at the rows of amulets, statuettes and other,  unclassifiable, objects with which it was laden. Ferrara's voice came.    \"That head of a priestess on the left, Cairn, is of great interest.  The brain had not been removed, and quite a colony of Dermestes  Beetles had propagated in the cavity. Those creatures never saw the  light, Cairn. Yet I assure you that they had eyes. I have nearly forty  of them in the small glass case on the table there. You might like to  examine them.\"    Cairn shuddered, but felt impelled to turn and look at these gruesome  relics. In a square, glass case he saw the creatures. They lay in rows  on a bed of moss; one might almost have supposed that unclean life yet  survived in the little black insects. They were an unfamiliar species  to Cairn, being covered with unusually long, black hair, except upon  the root of the wing-cases where they were of brilliant orange.    \"The perfect pupae of this insect are extremely rare,\" added Ferrara  informatively.    \"Indeed?\" replied Cairn.    He found something physically revolting in that group of beetles whose  history had begun and ended in the skull of a mummy.    \"Filthy things!\" he said. \"Why do you keep them?\"    Ferrara shrugged his shoulders.    \"Who knows?\" he answered enigmatically. \"They might prove useful, some  day.\"    A bell rang; and from Ferrara's attitude it occurred to Cairn that he  was expecting a visitor.    \"I must be off,\" he said accordingly.    And indeed he was conscious of a craving for the cool and  comparatively clean air of Piccadilly. He knew something of the great  evil which dwelt within this man whom he was compelled, by singular  circumstances, to tolerate. But the duty began to irk.    \"If you must,\" was the reply. \"Of course, your press work no doubt is  very exacting.\"    The note of badinage was discernible again, but Cairn passed out into  the _mandarah_ without replying, where the fountain plashed coolly and  the silver _mibkharah_ sent up its pencils of vapour. The outer door  was opened by the Oriental servant, and Ferrara stood and bowed to his  departing visitor. He did not proffer his hand.    \"Until our next meeting. Cairn, _es-selam aleykum_!\" (peace be with  you) he murmured, \"as the Moslems say. But indeed I shall be with you  in spirit, dear Cairn.\"    There was something in the tone wherein he spoke those last words that  brought Cairn up short. He turned, but the doors closed silently. A  faint breath of ambergris was borne to his nostrils.          CHAPTER V    THE RUSTLING SHADOWS      Cairn stepped out of the lift, crossed the hall, and was about to walk  out on to Piccadilly, when he stopped, staring hard at a taxi-cab  which had slowed down upon the opposite side whilst the driver awaited  a suitable opportunity to pull across.    The occupant of the cab was invisible now, but a moment before Cairn  had had a glimpse of her as she glanced out, apparently towards the  very doorway in which he stood. Perhaps his imagination was playing  him tricks. He stood and waited, until at last the cab drew up within  a few yards of him.    Myra Duquesne got out.    Having paid the cabman, she crossed the pavement and entered the  hall-way. Cairn stepped forward so that she almost ran into his arms.    \"Mr. Cairn!\" she cried. \"Why! have you been to see Antony?\"    \"I have,\" he replied, and paused, at a loss for words.    It had suddenly occurred to him that Antony Ferrara and Myra Duquesne  had known one another from childhood; that the girl probably regarded  Ferrara in the light of a brother.    \"There are so many things I want to talk to him about,\" she said. \"He  seems to know everything, and I am afraid I know very little.\"    Cairn noted with dismay the shadows under her eyes--the grey eyes that  he would have wished to see ever full of light and laughter. She was  pale, too, or seemed unusually so in her black dress; but the tragic  death of her guardian, Sir Michael Ferrara, had been a dreadful blow  to this convent-bred girl who had no other kin in the world. A longing  swept into Cairn's heart and set it ablaze; a longing to take all her  sorrows, all her cares, upon his own broad shoulders, to take her and  hold her, shielded from whatever of trouble or menace the future might  bring.    \"Have you seen his rooms here?\" he asked, trying to speak casually;  but his soul was up in arms against the"]]]
