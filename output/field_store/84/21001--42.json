Truth has already been stood on its  head when the obvious attorney of mere emptiness is mistaken for its  representative....      9.    Upon this theological instinct I make war: I find the tracks of it  everywhere. Whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and  dishonourable in all things. The pathetic thing that grows out of this  condition is called _faith_: in other words, closing one's eyes upon  one's self once for all, to avoid suffering the sight of incurable  falsehood. People erect a concept of morality, of virtue, of holiness  upon this false view of all things; they ground good conscience upon  faulty vision; they argue that no _other_ sort of vision has value any  more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of \"God,\"  \"salvation\" and \"eternity.\" I unearth this theological instinct in all  directions: it is the most widespread and the most _subterranean_ form  of falsehood to be found on earth. Whatever a theologian regards as true  _must_ be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth. His  profound instinct of self-preservation stands against truth ever coming  into honour in any way, or even getting stated. Wherever the influence  of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values, and the  concepts \"true\" and \"false\" are forced to change places: whatever is  most damaging to life is there called \"true,\" and whatever exalts it,  intensifies it, approves it, justifies it and makes it triumphant is  there called \"false.\"... When theologians, working through the  \"consciences\" of princes (or of peoples--), stretch out their hands for  _power_, there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue: the will  to make an end, the _nihilistic_ will exerts that power....      10.    Among Germans I am immediately understood when I say that theological  blood is the ruin of philosophy. The Protestant pastor is the  grandfather of German philosophy; Protestantism itself is its _peccatum  originale_. Definition of Protestantism: hemiplegic paralysis of  Christianity--_and_ of reason.... One need only utter the words  \"Tuebingen School\" to get an understanding of what German philosophy is  at bottom--a very artful form of theology.... The Suabians are the best  liars in Germany; they lie innocently.... Why all the rejoicing over  the appearance of Kant that went through the learned world of Germany,  three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and  teachers--why the German conviction still echoing, that with Kant came a  change for the _better_? The theological instinct of German scholars  made them see clearly just _what_ had become possible again.... A  backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open; the concept of the \"true  world,\" the concept of morality as the _essence_ of the world (--the two  most vicious errors that ever existed!), were once more, thanks to a  subtle and wily scepticism, if not actually demonstrable, then _at  least_ no longer _refutable_.... _Reason_, the _prerogative_ of reason,  does not go so far.... Out of reality there had been made \"appearance\";  an absolutely false world, that of being, had been turned into  reality.... The success of Kant is merely a theological success; he was,  like Luther and Leibnitz, but one more impediment to German integrity,  already far from steady.--      11.    A word now against Kant as a moralist. A virtue must be _our_ invention;  it must spring out of _our_ personal need and defence. In every other  case it is a source of danger. That which does not belong to our life  _menaces_ it; a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the  concept of \"virtue,\" as Kant would have it, is pernicious. \"Virtue,\"  \"duty,\" \"good for its own sake,\" goodness grounded upon impersonality or  a notion of universal validity--these are all chimeras, and in them one  finds only an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life, the  Chinese spirit of Koenigsberg. Quite the contrary is demanded by the most  profound laws of self-preservation and of growth: to wit, that every man  find his _own_ virtue, his _own_ categorical imperative. A nation goes  to pieces when it confounds _its_ duty with the general concept of duty.  Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every  \"impersonal\" duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction.--To  think that no one has thought of Kant's categorical imperative as  _dangerous to life_!... The theological instinct alone took it under  protection!--An action prompted by the life-instinct proves that it is a  _right_ action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it: and yet that  Nihilist, with his bowels of Christian dogmatism, regarded pleasure as  an _objection_.... What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think  and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire,  without pleasure--as a mere automaton of duty? That is the recipe for  _decadence_, and no less for idiocy.... Kant became an idiot.--And such  a man was the contemporary of Goethe! This calamitous spinner of cobwebs  passed for _the_ German philosopher--still passes today!... I forbid  myself to say what I think of the Germans.... Didn't Kant see in the  French Revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic  form to the _organic_? Didn't he ask himself if there was a single event  that could be explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in  man, so that on the basis of it, \"the tendency of mankind toward the  good\" could be _explained_, once and for all time? Kant's answer: \"That  is revolution.\" Instinct at fault in everything and anything, instinct  as a revolt against nature, German _decadence_ as a philosophy--_that is  Kant_!--      12.    I put aside a few sceptics, the types of decency in the history of  philosophy: the rest haven't the slightest conception of intellectual  integrity. They behave like women, all these great enthusiasts and  prodigies--they regard \"beautiful feelings\" as arguments, the \"heaving  breast\" as the bellows of divine inspiration, conviction as the  _criterion_ of truth. In the end, with \"German\" innocence, Kant tried to  give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption, this dearth of  intellectual conscience, by calling it \"practical reason.\" He  deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it  was desirable not to trouble with reason--that is, when morality, when  the sublime command \"thou shalt,\" was heard. When one recalls the fact  that, among all peoples, the philosopher is no more than a development  from the old type of priest, this inheritance from the priest, this  _fraud upon self_, ceases to be remarkable. When a man feels that he has  a divine mission, say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind--when a  man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the  mouthpiece of supernatural imperatives--when such a mission inflames  him, it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely  reasonable standards of judgment. He feels that he is _himself_  sanctified by this mission, that he is himself a type of a higher  order!... What has a priest to do with philosophy! He stands far above  it!--And hitherto the priest has _ruled_!--He has determined the meaning  of \"true\" and \"not true\"!...      13.    Let us not underestimate this fact: that _we  ourselves_, we free spirits, are already a \"transvaluation of all  values,\" a _visualized_ declaration of war and victory against all the  old concepts of \"true\" and \"not true.\" The most valuable intuitions are  the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which  determine _methods_. All the methods, all the principles of the  scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of  the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded  from the society of \"decent\" people--he passed as \"an enemy of God,\" as  a scoffer at the truth, as one \"possessed.\" As a man of science, he  belonged to the Chandala[2].... We have had the whole pathetic stupidity  of mankind against us--their every notion of what the truth _ought_ to  be, of what the service of the truth _ought_ to be--their every \"thou  shalt\" was launched against us.... Our objectives, our methods, our  quiet, cautious, distrustful manner--all appeared to them as absolutely  discreditable and contemptible.--Looking back, one may almost ask one's  self with reason if it was not actually an _aesthetic_ sense that kept  men blind so long: what they demanded of the truth was picturesque  effectiveness, and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses. It  was our _modesty_ that stood out longest against their taste.... How  well they guessed that, these turkey-cocks of God!    [2] The lowest of the Hindu castes.      14.    We have unlearned something. We have become more modest in every way. We  no longer derive man from the \"spirit,\" from the \"godhead\"; we have  dropped him back among the beasts. We regard him as the strongest of the  beasts because he is the craftiest; one of the results thereof is his  intellectuality. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a conceit  which would assert itself even here: that man is the great second  thought in the process of organic evolution. He is, in truth, anything  but the crown of creation: beside him stand many other animals, all at  similar stages of development.... And even when we say that we say a bit  too much, for man, relatively speaking, is the most botched of all the  animals and the sickliest, and he has wandered the most dangerously from  his instincts--though for all that, to be sure, he remains the most  _interesting_!--As regards the lower animals, it was Descartes who first  had the really admirable daring to describe them as _machina_; the whole  of our physiology is directed toward proving the truth of this doctrine.  Moreover, it is illogical "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#6)"],[1,"in length, except that cut by the  attendant who sat at the north, who made his about 1-1/4 inches long.  Being asked why he cut his shorter than the rest, he replied, \"All men are  not the same size.\" The sticks were sharpened at one end and cut squarely  off at the other. In order that all of the sticks should be of the same  length they were measured by placing the three first fingers across the  stick. The fifth man sat immediately to the right of the song priest, who  took a hollow reed from the large medicine bag from which he cut four  pieces, each piece the breadth of his three fingers. The reed, which was  cut with a stone knife, was afterwards rubbed with native tobacco. Six  sticks of each of the piles had their square ends beveled; these  represented females. The attendant on the east side of the rug having  completed his twelve sticks, painted them white with kaolin finely ground  and mixed with water. The flat ends of the sticks were colored black; the  beveled parts were painted blue; around the lower end of the blue was a  bit of yellow which represented the jaw painted with corn pollen. Three  black dots were painted upon the blue for the eyes and mouth; the ground  color was laid on with the finger; the other decorations were made with  yucca brushes. The man on the south side colored his sticks blue. The tops  of six sticks were painted yellow, and six were black. The black ends were  those having the beveled spots. These spots were blue with a chin of  yellow; they also had the three black dots for eyes and mouth. The man to  the west colored his sticks yellow with the flat ends black; the beveled  spots of six of them were blue with a yellow chin and three black dots for  eyes and mouth. The sticks to the north were colored black; six of them  had the beveled parts colored blue with a yellow jaw, and three spots for  eyes and mouth; the six sticks that were not beveled had their flat tops  painted blue. All these sticks were laid on the rug with their flat ends  outward. The attendants who prepared the reeds, each reed being colored  for a cardinal point, filled them with balls of humming-bird feathers and  tobacco and lighted them with a crystal, when they were touched with corn  pollen. The reed for the east was white, the one for the south blue, that  for the west yellow, and that for the north black. Each reed was placed at  its appropriate point in line with the sticks. (See Pl. CXVIII.) The  theurgist then advanced, carrying a basket half filled with corn meal.  This he placed in the center of the rug; when kneeling on the edge of the  rug and beginning with the white sticks, he placed first the white reed in  the east side of the basket, and passing from this point around to the  right he placed the six offerings to the gods, then the six to the  goddesses. Next taking the blue tube at the south end he placed it to the  left of the white line of sticks, leaving sufficient space for the sticks  between it and the white tube; all the blue ones were placed in position  corresponding to the white. The yellow followed next, and then the black.  All were placed with their flat ends or heads pointed to the rim of the  basket. The theurgist deposited the basket in the niche on a pile of  turkey feather wands, the wands resting upon a large medicine bag. The  sticks and scraps left after making the tubes were carried out and  deposited without ceremony.                                  [Illustration]          FIFTH CEREMONY.      The rug which was spread in front of the song priest was composed of two  blankets whose edges met, and upon this rug there were two lines of masks  running north and south; the tops of the masks were to the east. There  were sixteen masks; those representing the gods cover the head, and those  representing goddesses cover the face only. They were decorated with  ribbons, plumes, etc. During the forenoon prayers were said over them and  meal sprinkled upon them.          SIXTH CEREMONY.      Just after dark those who were to take part in the ceremony prepared to  personate one of the Hostjobokon and two of the Hostjoboard  (goddesses)--Hostjoghon and Hasjelti. Hostjobokon's body and limbs were  painted, and he wore a mountain lion's skin doubled lengthwise and  fastened around the loins at the back, and a silver belt encircled his  waist. Hasjelti wore knee breeches and a shirt of black velvet, ornamented  with silver buttons. His face and hands were covered with white kaolin.  Hostjoghon's body was painted white, and he wore a red silk scarf around  the loins, caught on with a silver belt. The two men personating the  goddesses had their limbs painted white; one wore a black sash around his  loins, held by a silver belt. The other had a red woolen scarf and silver  belt; gray foxskins hung from the back of the belts. The masks were  fastened to their heads before leaving the lodge by means of a string and  a lock of their hair, and they were then thrown back from the head. After  a little indulgence in their hoots they all left the lodge. The invalid  entered the lodge and, stepping upon a piece of white cotton which had  been laid diagonally across the rug to the northeast and southwest, took  off his clothing. The lodge had now become very crowded. The fire, which  had burned brightly during the day, was mere coals. The attendant at the  left of the song priest opened the choir with the rattle. The invalid sat  upon the cotton cloth. Hasjelti, entering with his favorite hoot amidst  rattle and song, placed the square (representing the concentrated winds)  four times over the head of the invalid and ran out of the lodge. He  entered again and received from the theurgist one of the twelve white  sticks which during the forenoon had been placed in the basket. The white  stick farthest from the white reed was handed him. This Hasjelti placed to  the soles of the feet, knees, palms, etc., of the invalid, amid hoots and  antics, after which he dashed out and hurled the stick to the east. One of  the Hostjoboard entered and received the next white stick, and after the  same ceremony ran out and cast it to the east. Hostjobokon returned and  the theurgist handed him the next white stick, when he repeated the  ceremony, hurried from the lodge, and threw the stick to the east.  Hostjoboard again entered, received a stick, repeated the ceremony, and  ran out and threw it to the east; and thus Hostjobokon and Hostjoboard  alternated until all the white sticks were disposed of, when Hasjelti  reappeared and received from the song priest the white reed (cigarette)  and carried it from the lodge. When he returned the theurgist handed him  one of the blue sticks, with which he repeated the ceremony and, leaving  the lodge, threw it to the south, when Hostjoghon and Hostjoboard  alternately disposed of the blue sticks in the same order in which the  white sticks had been distributed. The yellow and black sticks were  disposed of in a similar manner, Hasjelti officiating with the first stick  of each color and the reeds. The yellow sticks were thrown to the west;  the black to the north. This was all done amidst the wildest hoots and  song of the choir, accompanied by the rattle.    Hasjelti again appeared and placed the square four times over the  invalid's head with wild hoots. The four cigarettes to be smoked by the  gods were afterwards taken by four of the personators of the gods and  deposited in a secluded spot under a tree and sprinkled with corn pollen;  after their return Hasjelti again placed the square over the invalid's  head. The song priest placed two live coals in front of the invalid, and  upon the coals he put a pinch of tobacco, the smoke of which the invalid  inhaled. The attendant poured water over the coals, when they were thrown  out at the fire opening of the lodge. The personators of the gods returned  to the lodge bearing their masks in their hands. The invalid put on his  clothing and took his seat upon the rug, but in a short time he returned  to his former seat on the northwest side of the lodge. The sweat-house  priest appeared with a large buffalo robe which he spread before the song  priest, the head pointing north, and upon this various kinds of calico  were laid, carefully folded the length of the robe. There were many yards  of this. Upon the calico was spread a fine large buckskin, and on this  white muslin; these were all gifts from the invalid to the song priest.  The masks were then laid upon the cotton (see Pl. CXV, 7, 8); the mask of  Hasjelti was on the east side to the north end, that of Hostjoghon at the  south end, and between these the six masks of the Hostjobokon were placed.  Immediately under these were the six Hostjoboard, and beneath the latter  were the masks of Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni at the north end. Three  other masks of the Etsethle followed in line running south. After all the  masks had been properly arranged the song priest sprinkled them with  pollen. Beginning with Hasjelti he sprinkled every mask of the upper line  thus: Over the top of the head down the center of the face, then forming a  kind of half-circle he passed over the right cheek, then passing his hand  backward to the left he sprinkled the same line up the left cheek. The  second and third rows had simply a line of the pollen run across the  masks, beginning at the north end. The theurgist repeated a prayer during  the sprinkling of the pollen, then handed the bag of pollen to the priest  of the sweat house, who repeated the sprinkling of the masks, when  everyone in the lodge, each having his individual bag of pollen, hastened  forward and sprinkled the masks, at the same time offering prayers. The  theurgist and priest of the sweat house again sprinkled pollen on the  masks as heretofore described.    Baskets and bowls in unlimited quantity, filled with food, were placed in  a circle around the fire which now burned brightly. The guests"]]]
