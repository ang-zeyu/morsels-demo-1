[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#6)"],[1," Mormons all preached there when they desired to do so.    In 1837 a man by the name of King, from Indiana, passed by, or  came to my place, on his way to Missouri to join the Mormons. He  had been a New Light, or Campbellite preacher. I invited him to  stay at my place until the next spring. I gave him provisions for  his family, and he consented to and did stay with me some time.    Soon after that there was a Methodist meeting at my house. After  the Methodist services were through I invited King to speak. He  talked about half an hour on the first principles of the gospel  as taught by Christ and his apostles, denouncing all other  doctrines as spurious. This put an end to other denominations  preaching in my house.    That was the first sermon I ever heard concerning Mormonism. The  winter before, two elders, Durphy and Peter Dustan, stayed a few  days with Hanford Stewart, a cousin of Levi Stewart, the bishop  of Kanab. They preached in the neighborhood, but I did not attend  or hear them preach. My wife and her mother went to hear them,  and were much pleased with their doctrine. I was not a member of  any Church, and considered the religion of the day as merely the  opinions of men who preached for hire and worldly gain. I  believed in God and in Christ, but I did not see any denomination  that taught the apostolic doctrine as set forth in the New  Testament. I read in the New Testament where the apostle Paul  recommended his people to prove all things, then hold fast to  that which is good; also that he taught that though an angel from  heaven should preach any other gospel than this which ye have  received, let him be accursed. This forbid me believing any  doctrine that differed from that taught by Christ and his  apostles. I wanted to belong to the true Church, or none.    When King began to preach at my house I noticed that every other  denomination opposed him. I was surprised at this. I could not  see how he could injure them if they were right. I had been  brought up as a strict Catholic. I was taught to look upon all  sects, except the Catholic, with disfavor, and my opinion was  that the Mormons and all others were apostates from the true  Church; that the Mormon Church was made up of the off-scourings  of hell, or of apostates from the true Church. I then had not the  most distant idea that the Mormons believed in the Old and New  Testaments. I was astonished to hear King prove his religion from  the Scriptures. I reflected. I determined, as every honest man  should do, to fairly investigate his doctrines, and to do so with  a prayerful heart.    The more I studied the question, the more interested I became. I  talked of the doctrine to nearly every man I met. The excitement  soon became general, and King was invited to preach in many  places.    In the meantime Levi Stewart, one of my near neighbors, became  interested in this religion, and went to Far West, Missouri, to  investigate the question of Mormonism at headquarters. He joined  the Church there, and when he returned he brought with him the  Book of Mormon and a monthly periodical called the Elder's  Journal.    By this time my anxiety was very great, and I determined to  fathom the question to the bottom. My frequent conversations with  Elder King served to carry me on to a conviction that the  dispensation of the fullness of time would soon usher in upon the  world. If such was the case I wished to know it; for the  salvation of my never-dying soul was of far more importance to me  than all other earthly considerations. I regarded the heavenly  boon of eternal life as a treasure of great price. I left off my  frivolity and commenced to lead a moral life. I began trying to  lay up treasure in heaven, in my Father's rich storehouse, and  wished to become an heir of righteousness, to inherit in common  with the faithful children the rich legacy of our Father's  Kingdom.    During that year our child, Elizabeth Adaline, died of scarlet  fever. The night she lay a corpse I finished reading the Book of  Mormon. I never closed my eyes in sleep from the time I commenced  until I finished the book. I read it after asking God to give me  knowledge to know if it was genuine and of Divine authority. By  careful examination I found that it was in strict accord with the  Bible and the gospel therein contained; that it purported to have  been given to another people, who then lived on this continent,  as the Old and New Testaments had been given to the Israelites in  Asia. I also found many passages in the Bible in support of the  forthcoming of such a work, preparatory to the gathering of the  remnant of the House of Israel, and the opening glory of the  Latter-day work, and the setting up of the Kingdom of God upon  the earth for the reception of the Son of Man, and the millennial  reign of Christ upon the earth a thousand years; all of which, to  me, was of great moment. My whole soul was absorbed in these  things.    My neighbor Stewart, who had just returned from Missouri, brought  the most cheering and thrilling accounts of the power and  manifestations of the Holy Spirit working with that people; that  the spiritual gifts of the true believers in Christ were enjoyed  by all who lived faithfully and sought them; that there was no  deception about it; that everyone had a testimony for himself,  and was not dependent upon another; that they had the gift of  tongues, the interpretation of those tongues, the power of  healing the sick by the laying on of hands, prophesying, casting  out devils and evil spirits. All of which he declared, with words  of soberness, to be true.    Stewart had been my playmate and my companion in former years.  His word had great influence on me, and strengthened my  conviction that the Book of Mormon was true - that it was a star  opening the dispensation of the fullness of time. I believed the  Book of Mormon was true, and, if so, everything but my soul's  salvation was a matter of secondary consideration to me. I had a  small fortune, a nice home, kind neighbors, and numerous friends,  but nothing could shake the determination I then formed to break  up, sell out, and leave Illinois and go to the Saints at Far  West, Missouri.    My friends used every known argument to change my determination,  but these words came into my mind, \"First seek the righteousness  of the Kingdom of God, then all things necessary will be added  unto you \"; and again, \"What would it profit a man to gain the  whole world and lose his own soul?\" or, \"What could a man gain in  exchange for his soul?\" I was here brought to the test, and my  action was to decide on which I placed the most value - my  earthly possessions and enjoyments or my reward in future, the  salvation of my never-dying soul. I took up my cross and chose  the latter. I sold out and moved to Far West. I took leave of my  friends and made my way to where the Saints had gathered in Zion.  Our journey was one full of events interesting to us, but not of  sufficient importance to relate to the public. While on the  journey I sold most of my cattle on time to an old man, a friend  of Stewart's - took his notes, and let him keep them, which, as  the sequel shows, was fortunate for me.    We arrived at Far West, the then headquarters of the Mormon  Church, about the 4th day of June, 1838. The country around there  for some fifteen or twenty miles, each way, was settled by  Mormons. I do not think any others lived within that distance.  The Mormons who had been driven from Jackson, Ray, and Clay  counties, in 1833, settled in Caldwell and Daviess counties.    The night after our arrival at Far West there was a meeting to be  held there. Stewart said to me:    \"Let us go up and hear them speak with new tongues and interpret  the same, and enjoy the gifts of the gospel generally, for this  is to be a prayer and testimony meeting.\"    \"I want no signs,\" I said. \"I believe the gospel they preach on  principle and reason, not upon signs - its consistency is all I  ask. All I want are natural, logical, and reasonable arguments,  to make up my mind from.\"    The Sunday after, I attended church in Far West Hall. The hall  was crowded with people, so much so that I, with others, could  not gain admittance to the building. I obtained standing room in  one of the windows. I saw a man enter the house without  uncovering his head. The Prophet ordered the Brother of Gideon to  put that man out, for his presumption in daring to enter and  stand in the house of God without uncovering his head. This  looked to me like drawing the lines pretty snug and close;  however, I knew but little of the etiquette of high life, and  much less about that of the Kingdom of Heaven. I looked upon  Joseph Smith as a prophet of God - as one who held the keys of  this last dispensation, and I hardly knew what to think about the  violent manner in which the man was treated who had entered the  house of God without taking his hat off. But this did not lessen  my faith; it served to confirm it. I was fearful that I might in  some way unintentionally offend the great and good man who stood  as God's prophet on the earth to point out the way of salvation.    We remained at the house of Elder Joseph Hunt, in Far West,  several days. He was then a strong Mormon, and was afterwards  first captain in the Mormon Battalion. He, as an elder in the  Church, was a preacher of the gospel; all of his family were firm  in the faith.    Elder Hunt preached to me the necessity of humility and a strict  obedience to the gospel requirements through the servants of God.  He informed me that the apostles and elders were our true  teachers, and it was our duty to hear, learn, and obey; that the  spirit of God was very fine and delicate, and was easily grieved  and driven from us: that the more humble we were, the more of the  Holy Spirit we would enjoy.    After staying in Far West about a week we moved about twenty  miles, and settled "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23533"],[0,"A War-time Journal, Germany 1914 and German Travel Notes (#6)"],[1,"from a most unexpected quarter! I can never  cease to be grateful for the goodness and kindness which relieved my  distress. The Germans look downcast, the Russians jubilant. How  paternal this Government is no one who has not lived in Germany can  imagine. For instance, above the nearest pillar box I saw a notice  written \"Don't forget address and stamps!\"    _September 20th._--Our passports are now in the hands of the military  authorities at Frankfort, and Mr. Ives, the American Vice-Consul, is  doing all in his power to get us leave to go. The Superintendent of  the Inhalatorium is most kind and sympathetic. She inquired why I had  not been there for three days, and when I told her \"Gar kein Geld\" (no  money) was the cause, she cried with real feeling, \"Schrecklich!\"  (terrible). Any thing to do with money or the want of it appeals to  the Teutonic mind, although the Germans sneer at us for being a nation  of shopkeepers. There are two words we hope never to hear again,  \"Kultur\" and \"Unser.\" \"Unser Deutschland,\" \"Unser Kaiser,\" \"Unser  Kultur.\" How weary and trite are these! What an extraordinary mixture  the Germans are, brave, conceited, sentimental, prosaic, patriotic,  and yet no people so soon lose their national characteristics, and  become citizens of another country as Germans. Many of their  intellectual poses are absolutely morbid. They adore Ibsen as a  playwright and despise Goldsmith and Sheridan; they worship Gauguin,  and the school of Impressionists, and have little appreciation  nowadays for pre-Raphaelitism. They are intensely and truly musical,  and it is amazing, taking into consideration their extraordinary lack  of humour, that they should be such accomplished students of  Shakespeare, but of real wit or humour the German possesses not an  atom. Take, for instance, the modern novels of Suderman, of Rudolph  Herzog, of Rudolph Stratz, of Bernard Kellerman, of Paul Heyse, and  you will find intense seriousness, tragedy, pathos, masterly drawing  of character, and absolutely no fun from cover to cover. As for the  \"Fliegende Blaetter,\" the German \"Punch,\" it is the sickliest imitation  of humour possible to conceive. Foremost in science, the German is yet  a neophyte in the graces and arts of life. What cooking! what clothes!    _September 22nd._--If we may believe such good news we are to be  released from this irksome life, and set at liberty next Saturday. Our  joy is much damped, however, by hearing that none of the men are to be  allowed to leave, and, of course, their wives stay with them. Mr. Ives  has made a special journey to Berlin on behalf of our poor men, but  the authorities are obdurate.    People say that the loss of life in this terrible war is beyond belief  as far as the Germans are concerned. To hide this the Emperor requests  that no one shall wear mourning for the dead until the war is over.  Also, no complete catalogues of casualties are issued, only lists for  each kingdom, or duchy, so that the bulk of the people have no idea of  the waste of life. The wounded being so numerous, the doctors now have  little time to attend to them on the spot, and therefore they are put  into trains and sent off to \"Lazaretts\" sometimes before even their  wounds are washed. A Belgian lady who had a special police permit to  go to Frankfort, returned this afternoon in a train full of wounded  soldiers. One of these was put into her carriage. He had been badly  shot in the arm; his sleeve was soaked with blood, and that had  coagulated; his wound had never been washed, and French earth was  still on his boots, and yet he had been sent in this condition from  Rheims to Giessen!    _September 23rd._--Terrible news! A telegram was posted up in the town  this morning, saying that three English \"Panzerkreuzers\" had been sunk  by one German submarine. Of course the church bells pealed, and the  flags came out, and the children sang \"Nun danket alle Gott,\" because  950 brave Englishmen had gone under. We are much depressed, and our  depression is aggravated by the want of occupation here. We dare not  sketch for fear of being \"verhaftet\" (arrested). It is no good writing  because every scrap of paper will be taken from us on the frontier;  nobody I know plays bridge, and so I read and walk all day long. Miss  H---- tells me that a rude young clerk in the \"Loewen-Apotheke\" refused  to talk English to her this morning, \"You will have to learn German  now, because we shall be in London within a fortnight,\" said he! No  German I have yet known foresees any other result of this war but  success. The Fatherland Commissariat, according to the Italian papers,  leaves much to be desired. The unfortunate soldiers are almost  starving, and often live for days together on raw carrots, turnips,  herbs, or any other vegetable they can root up out of the ground. The  doctors are puzzled because men have died of such seemingly slight  wounds. One case seemed so incomprehensible that an autopsy was  decided on, and a raw root with fragments of earth upon it was found  in the poor creature's stomach. The Russians left at 5 a.m. this  morning, men and women. It is more than hard that our poor men should  be left behind. Lady M----, who has been ill, and her daughter, an  invalid lady, and her maid, were given special passes to go a couple  of days ago. Miss M---- and Miss G---- went to the police station  armed with these passes, and requested to have their passports back.  \"The Demon\" curtly refused. \"But you _must_ give them to us,\" said  Miss M----. \"Don't say _muessen_ to me!\" said \"the Demon,\" \"_bitten_  is the word!\" (Don't say _must_ to me, _beg_ is the word).    _September 24th._--Joyfully packing! A last meeting was held at the  \"Prince of Wales' Hotel\" where kind Mr. S---- presided, and we all  received instructions for our journey, and our long detained  passports!    Fifty women and children go. We sleep in Frankfort, and cross from  Flushing to Folkestone. Oh! that terrible mined sea, and the  \"untersuchung\" of the Frontier. I tremble for this Diary, all letters  I have destroyed.    FRANKFORT, _September 25th._--We are still in the enemy's country of  course, but have come out of our prison Altheim. All were early at the  Bahn-Hof. There for the last time, please God! we found our old horror  the Chief of Police. He had a long paper in his hand, and read out our  names; \"Hamilton?\" \"Here!\" \"Your passport?\" (which he scrutinised as  if he had never seen such a thing before), and so on. As we got our  precious papers back we passed through the barrier, where our tickets  were clipped, and on to the platform above. The train when it came in  was crammed with soldiers, and we were advised to wait two hours for  the next, but (to a woman) we all preferred travelling third, or even  fourth class, rather than remain another hour where we had suffered so  much. Miss G---- told me afterwards that she had travelled with two  German men, who cursed England up and down, using the most horrible  language about her.    Presently a wounded soldier came into the carriage, and they asked him  where he had been fighting. \"On the Western Frontier,\" said he.    \"With the French?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Did you see the English?\"    \"No.\"    \"Of course not! They had all run away. Cowards, cowards!\"    These are the things which make life so unendurable in an enemy's  land. I was sent here to the \"Hessicher-Hof,\" which, although it  masquerades under another name, I had no difficulty in recognising as  the former \"Englischer-Hof.\" Miss H---- went to the \"Hotel Bristol,\"  and when she got there found over the door the one word \"Hotel.\" What  we women should have done without the able committee who arranged all  details for us with such kindness and thoroughness, I cannot imagine.    _September 28th._--There were few tears shed when we steamed out of  Frankfort two days ago on our way to home and freedom. It was  wonderful to feel that we might talk above a whisper in the  railway-carriage; amazing that we had not to scrutinize carefully  every corner to be sure no spies lurked there, and most delightful of  all to know that we had got beyond the reach of the Demon of the  Burg-Strasse. Egotistically enough we went over in retrospect our  anxieties, disappointments and miseries. Should we ever get rid of  that evil shadow, we wondered, which had darkened so cruelly two weary  months of our lives!    Now and then we looked out of the windows with distaste--agreed that  the outskirts of Frankfort were hideous with their obtrusive and  insistent collection of factory chimneys; and shuddered at the distant  and beautiful background of mountain and forest, to us so teeming  with painful memories. We exclaimed at the unsightliness of the huge  skeleton lettering proclaiming to all the world that a _maschinen-Fabrik_  was below. Even when we entered a bucolic region of modest gardens and  saw nothing more aggressive than cabbages and turnips, we turned away  from the sight with aversion. Yet the villages are picturesque enough,  and so are the towns. Timber-framed and gabled houses, steeply pitched  red roofs and stunted grey and mossy church spires, certainly make no  unpleasing picture. In happier days I have admired the grape-vines  meandering over the whitewashed cottages, and marvelled at the  monotony of taste which furnished every window-ledge with exactly four  pots of scarlet geraniums. Now, nothing pleased us that was German;  scenery, architecture or people! \"This,\" we said to ourselves, is \"the  sunny Rhineland through which we are passing, and we see no obvious  signs as we go by of the struggle which is devastating Belgium and  menacing France.\" At the first station, however, we realised that  Germany was indeed at war. Red Cross nurses seemed everywhere. Long  tables were spread with snowy cloths and bore coffee urns, zwiebacks,  hoernchen and huge bowls of steaming soup ready for the poor wounded as  they pass"]]]
