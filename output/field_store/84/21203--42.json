This conclusion is amply supported by facts. The common principles which  affect the minds of nations towards each other; the reprisals, which are  vindicated in civilised war, only differ in circumstance. A thousand  injuries, never recorded, if stated in a connexion with these results,  would enable us to see how often the harmless settler was sacrificed to  passions, provoked by his robber countrymen.    In 1826, a remarkable instance was brought under the notice of  government. Dunne, who at length met the punishment he deserved, seized  a woman, and forced her to the hut of Mr. Thompson, on the Shannon,  where he detained her with violence; she, however, escaped to her  people, and roused them to avenge her. Dunne, next morning, suddenly  found himself in their midst: his musket protected him, and after hours  of such torture as his conscience and fears might inflict, he managed to  get off. On the following day, the woman led her tribe, vociferating  threats, to the hut in which she had been maltreated, where they  massacred James Scott, a man with whom they had lived in friendship for  many years, and who, when warned a few days before to be on his guard,  smiled at the notion of danger.    The treatment of some of these women was such, as no one can be expected  to credit, until prepared by extensive acquaintance with human  depravation. A monster boasted that, having captured a native woman,  whose husband he had killed, he strung the bleeding head to her neck,  and drove her before him as his prize. Had not this fact been guaranteed  by formal enquiry, it could only have been admitted as a specimen of  brutal gasconade, and in proof of how much a cruel fancy could exceed  the actual guilt of mankind. It sometimes happened, that an unfortunate  servant would receive the spear intended for his predecessor in the same  employ, to whom it was justly due. Among the whites, there were men  distinguished for the malicious vigour with which they tracked and  murdered the native people. A lad, on his arrival from England, was sent  into the interior, and warned never to wander from his dwelling; but he  forgot the danger he did not see, and straying a short distance, he was  murdered. He had never injured his destroyers; but then he lived on the  lands just before in charge of a villain, and who, like a Roman warrior,  took his name of \"Abyssinian Tom,\" from the locality of his exploits.    The infliction of judicial punishments, interrupted the friendly  intercourse of the tribe that visited Hobart Town, and who were  encouraged to resort to Kangaroo Point, where huts were erected for  their use. The arrest of two of their number filled them with  apprehension. The aborigines, Jack and Dick, were executed on the 16th  September, 1826, an event which terminated all present hope of amicable  relations. The murder of a shepherd at Oyster Bay, Great Swan Port, was  proved against them by the evidence of convict stock-keepers; a topic of  contemporary complaint: but the courts regularly relied on the same  class of witnesses, and in this case there is no special reason for  suspicion. The fact was not questioned: the culprits had been treated  with kindness by the government, and efforts had been made by Colonel  Arthur to acquaint them with the obligations of British subjects. He  asserts that, by personal interviews, he was fully convinced that they  understood the benevolent views of the crown. One of these blacks was so  far civilised, as to be admitted to the sacrament of the English church.  His companion was a youth, and denied his guilt. The old black was  carried to the scaffold, and resisted the execution: the younger,  disentangled his arms, and struggled for his life. It was, indeed, a  melancholy spectacle. Successive Governors had witnessed crimes against  their race, atrocious and unpunished: hundreds had fallen unavenged by  that public justice which treated them as murderers.    On the day of their execution, the Governor addressed the colony. He  vindicated this act of severity, as requisite to intimidate the blacks;  but he solemnly pledged his government to equal justice, and that the  law should take its course on individuals of either race, who might  violate \"the common law of mankind.\"    The discussions which followed, proved the division of public opinion on  the propriety of this measure. It was not clear, to many, that the  natives were legally accountable, or that their punishment was just.  Grotius and Vattel were quoted; writers, who have discoursed upon the  relations of man, and distinguished the felon from the enemy. It was,  however, simply a question between judicial and private vengeance: the  interference of the court could alone prevent a general proscription. In  the heat of anger, no provocation would be weighed--no palliative  admitted; and the innocent would perish with the guilty.[9]    The impression on the aborigines was unfavorable: they saw only the  death of an unfortunate countryman, and, perhaps, the last act of the  white man's warfare. Its moral influence was not great on either race:  it neither softened the resentment of the British, nor intimidated the  blacks: it was a mere variety in the forms of destruction. The brother  of one of these men led the Oyster Bay tribe, and prompted the murders  which, in 1830, filled the colony with wailing.    The rapid colonisation of the island from 1821 to 1824, and the  diffusion of settlers and servants through districts hitherto  unlocated, added to the irritation of the natives, and multiplied the  agents of destruction. Land unfenced, and flocks and herds moving on  hill and dale, left the motions of the native hunters free; but hedges  and homesteads were signals which even the least rationality could not  fail to understand, and on every re-appearance the natives found some  favorite spot surrounded by new enclosures, and no longer theirs.    The proclamations of the government assumed the fixed relations of the  different tribes to particular districts. Oyster Bay and the Big River  were deemed sufficiently precise definitions of those tribes, exposed to  public jealousy and prosecution. It is true, they had no permanent  villages, and accordingly no individual property in land; but the  boundaries of each horde were known, and trespass was a declaration of  war.    The English, of modern times, will not comprehend joint ownership,  notwithstanding the once \"common\" property of the nation has been only  lately distributed by law. The rights of the aborigines were never  recognised by the crown; yet it is not less certain that they saw with  intelligence the progress of occupation, and felt that the gradual  alienation of their hunting grounds implied their expulsion and  extinction.    Native topography is, indeed, limited; but it is exact. Every mountain,  valley, and river, is distinguished and named. The English have often  been indebted to these primitive surveyors, for guidance through the  forests which they came to divide. The tribes took up their periodical  stations, and moved with intervals so regular, that their migrations  were anticipated, as well as the season of their return. The person  employed in their pursuit, by the aid of his native allies, was able to  predict at what period and place he should find a tribe, the object of  his mission; and though months intervened, he found them in the valley,  and at the time he had foretold. Expectations of this sort could only be  justified by the regularity of their movements, and the exact knowledge  of the guides.[10] Nor were they indifferent to the charms of a native  land. A visitor enquired of a native woman at Flinders, whether she  preferred that place to several others mentioned, where she had lived at  times, and she answered with indifference; but when, to test her  attachment to her early haunts, the querist said, \"and not Ringarooma?\"  she exclaimed, with touching animation, \"Oh yes! Ringarooma!  Ringarooma!\"    A chief accompanied the commandant to Launceston in 1847. At his own  earnest request, he was taken to see the Cataract Basin of the South  Esk, a river which foams and dashes through a narrow channel of  precipitous rocks, until a wider space affords it tranquillity. It was a  station of his people; precisely the kind of spot which gypsies, on the  \"business of Egypt,\" would choose for their tents. As he drew nigh, his  excitement was intense: he leaped from rock to rock, with the gestures  and exclamations of delight. So powerful were his emotions, that the lad  with him became alarmed, lest the associations of the scene should  destroy the discipline of twelve years exile: but the woods were silent:  he heard no voice save his own, and he returned pensively with his young  companion. These examples shew, that the native was not an indifferent  spectator of that rapid occupation, which must have appeared prodigious  to scattered tribes.    A further cause of exasperation, consequent on the preceding, was the  destruction of game. The extent to which it was carried was enormous.  The skin of the kangaroo sold for a few pence, was the perquisite of the  stock-keepers, and long the chief object of their daily enterprise.  Their rugs, their clothing, were composed often of these spoils, and the  pursuit did not slacken until the persecuted animal retired. Jeffery,  describing the field sports of his day (1810), tells us that flocks of  emu and kangaroo were found at short intervals, and that a cart might be  loaded with their flesh by the sport of a morning; but he remained long  enough, to observe a sensible diminution, and proposed limitations by  law to the havoc of the whites; an idea, subsequently entertained by the  _Aborigines'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#6)"],[1,"sacrifice has put forth its mystic energy the  god cannot strike his blow. We are told also that Vishnu cooks  buffaloes and boils milk for Indra,[17] for buffaloes were no doubt  anciently offered to Indra. The vivid reality of Indra's character has  clothed Vishnu with some of its own flesh and blood; originally a  priestly abstraction, he has become through association with Indra a  living being, a real god. The blood which has thus been poured into  his veins will enable him to live through a critical period of his  life, until by combination with another deity he will rise to new and  supreme sovereignty. But of that more anon. Meanwhile let us note the  significance of this union of Vishnu and Indra in the Veda. Vishnu,  the spirit of Sacrifice, is in a sense representative of the Brahman  priesthood, and Indra, as I have shown, is commonly regarded as  typical of the warrior order. In the Rig-veda Indra is powerless  without Vishnu's mystic service, and Vishnu labours to aid Indra in  his heroic works for the welfare of men and gods. Surely this is an  allegory, though the priests may so far be only dimly conscious of its  full meaning--an allegory bodying forth the priestly ideal of the  reign of righteousness, in which the King is strong by the mystic  power of the Priest, and the Priest lives for the service of the King.    [Footnote 17: RV. VI. xvii. 11, VIII. lxvi. 10; the myth in RV. I.  lxi. 7, VIII. lxvi. 10, and TS. VI. ii. 4, 2-3 is expanded from this  original idea. Cf. Macdonell, _Vedic Myth._, p. 41.]    There is another god who is destined to become in future ages Vishnu's  chief rival--Rudra, \"The Tawny,\" or Siva, \"The Gracious.\" He belongs  to the realm of popular superstition, a spiteful demon ever ready to  smite men and cattle with disease, but likewise dispensing healing  balms and medicines to those that win his favour. The Rigvedic priests  as yet do not take much interest in him, and for the most part they  leave him to their somewhat despised kinsmen the Atharvans, who do a  thriving trade in hymns and spells to secure the common folk against  his wrath.    There are many more gods, godlings, and spirits in the Vedic religion;  but we must pass over them. We have seen enough, I hope, to give us a  fair idea of the nature and value of that religion in general. What  then is its value?    The Rigveda is essentially a priestly book; but it is not entirely a  priestly book. Much of the thought to which it gives utterance is  popular in origin and sentiment, and is by no means of the lowest  order. On this groundwork the priests have built up a system of  hieratic thought and ritual of their own, in which there is much that  deserves a certain respect. There is a good deal of fine poetry in  it. There is also in it some idea of a law of righteousness: in spite  of much wild and unmoral myth and fancy, its gods for the most part  are not capricious demons but spirits who act in accordance with  established laws, majestic and wise beings in whom are embodied the  highest ideals to which men have risen as yet. Moreover, the priests  in the later books have given us some mystic hymns containing vigorous  and pregnant speculations on the deepest questions of existence,  speculations which are indeed fanciful and unscientific, but which  nevertheless have in them the germs of the powerful idealism that is  destined to arise in centuries to come. On the other hand, the priests  have cast their system in the mould of ritualism. Ritual, ceremony,  sacrifice, professional benefit--these are their predominant  interests. The priestly ceremonies are conceived to possess a magical  power of their own; and the fixed laws of ritual by which these  ceremonies are regulated tend to eclipse, and finally even to swallow  up, the laws of moral righteousness under which the gods live. A few  generations more, and the priesthood will frankly announce its ritual  to be the supreme law of the universe. Meanwhile they are becoming  more and more indifferent to the personalities of the gods, when they  have preserved any; they are quite ready to ascribe attributes of one  deity to another, even attributes of nominal supremacy, with  unscrupulous inconsistency and dubious sincerity; for the  personalities of the different gods are beginning to fade away in  their eyes, and in their mind is arising the conception of a single  universal Godhead.          CHAPTER II    THE AGE OF THE BRAHMANAS AND UPANISHADS      Centuries have passed since the hymns of the Rig-veda were composed.  The Aryans have now crossed the fateful ridge on the east of their  former settlements, and have spread themselves over the lands of  Northern Hindostan around the upper basins of the Ganges and Jamna,  reaching eastward as far as Bihar and southward down to the Vindhya  Mountains, and in the course of their growth they have absorbed not a  little of the blood of the dark-skinned natives. The old organisation  of society by tribes has come to an end, though the names of many  ancient tribes are still heard; the Aryans are now divided laterally  by the principle of what we call \"caste,\" which is based upon a  combination of religious and professional distinctions, and vertically  by the rule of kings, while a few oligarchic governments still survive  to remind them of Vedic days. In these kingdoms the old tribes are  beginning to be fused together; from these combinations new States are  arising, warring with one another, constantly waxing and waning.  Society is ruled politically by kings, spiritually by Brahmans. With  the rise of the kingdom an Established Church has come into existence,  and the Brahman priesthood works out its principles to the bitterest  end of logic.    The Brahmans are now, more than they ever were before, a close  corporation of race, religion, and profession, a religious fraternity  in the strict sense of the words. While other classes of the Aryans  have mixed their blood to a greater or less degree with that of the  natives, the Brahmans have preserved much of the pure Aryan strain.  They, moreover, have maintained the knowledge of the ancient Vedic  language in which the sacred hymns of their forefathers were composed,  of the traditions associated with them, and of the priestly lore of  Vedic ritual. Proud of this heritage and resolved to maintain it  undiminished, they have knitted themselves into a close spiritual and  intellectual aristocracy, which stands fast like a lighthouse amidst  the darkness and storms of political changes. They employ all the arts  of the priest, the thinker, the statesman, and even the magician to  preserve their primacy; and around them the manifold variety of the  other castes, in all their divisions and subdivisions, groups itself  to make up the multi-coloured web of Indian life.    In course of time this priesthood will spread out octopus-like  tentacles over the whole of India. Becoming all things to all men, it  will find a place in its pantheon for all gods and all ideas,  baptising them by orthodox names or justifying them by ingenious  fictions. It will send forth apostles and colonies even to the  furthermost regions of the distant South, which, alien in blood and in  tradition, will nevertheless accept them and surrender its best  intellect to their control. It will even admit into the lower ranks of  its own body men of foreign birth by means of legal fictions, in order  to maintain its control of religion. Though itself splitting up into  scores of divisions varying in purity of blood and tradition, it will  still as a whole maintain its position as against all other classes of  society. That the Brahman is the Deity on earth, and other classes  shall accept this dogma and agree to take their rank in accordance  with it, will become the principle holding together a vast  agglomeration of utterly diverse elements within the elastic bounds of  Catholic Brahmanism.    But as yet this condition of things has not arrived. The Brahmans are  still comparatively pure in blood and homogeneous in doctrine, and  they have as yet sent forth no colonies south of the Vindhya. They are  established in the lands of the Ganges and Jamna as far to the east as  Benares, and they look with some contempt on their kinsmen in the  western country that they have left behind. They are busily employed  in working out to logical conclusions the ideas and principles of  their Rigvedic forefathers. They have now three Vedas; for to the old  Rig-veda they have added a Yajur-veda for the use of the sacrificant  orders of priests and a Sama-veda or hymnal containing Rigvedic hymns  arranged for the chanting of choristers. The result of these labours  is that they have created a vast and intricate system of sacrificial  ritual, perhaps the most colossal of its kind that the world has ever  seen or ever will see. What is still more remarkable, the logical  result of this immense development of ritualism is that the priesthood  in theory is practically atheistic, while on the other hand a certain  number of its members have arrived at a philosophy of complete  idealism which is beginning to turn its back upon ritualism.    The atheist is not so much the man who denies the existence of any god  as the man to whom God is not God, who looks upon the Deity as  subordinate to powers void of holiness and nobility, the man who will  not see in God the highest force in the world of nature and in the  realm of the spirit. In this sense the Brahmans are thorough atheists.  According to them, the universe with all that is in it--gods, men, and  lower things--is created and governed by an iron law of soulless  natural necessity. It has arisen by emanation from a cosmic Principle,  Prajapati, \"the Lord of Creatures,\" an impersonal being who shows no  trace of moral purpose in his activity. Prajapati himself is not  absolutely the first in the course of nature. The Brahmanas, the  priestly books composed"]]]
