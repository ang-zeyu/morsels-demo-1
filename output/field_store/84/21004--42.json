He never gathered honey or made wax, yet he could not bear to see a  Worker lose any time.    The Worker did not hang herself up and make wax, however. She never did  that except on cloudy days, and she was one of those Bees who seem to  think that nothing will come out right unless they stop working to see  about it. There was plenty waiting to be done, but she was too sad and  anxious to do it. She might have known that since her friends were only  minding the law, it was right to keep the new Queen in her cell.    The Queen Mother was restless and fussy. She could not think of her  work, and half the time she did not know whether she was laying a Drone  egg or a Worker egg. In spite of that, she did not make any mistake, or  put one into the wrong kind of cell. \"I cannot stay here with a young  Queen,\" said she. \"I will not stay here. I will take my friends with me  and fly away.\"    Whenever she met a Worker, she struck her feelers on those of her  friend, and then this friend knew exactly how she felt about it. In this  way the news was passed around, and soon many of the Workers were as  restless as their Queen Mother. They were so excited over it at times  that the air of the hive grew very hot. After a while they would become  quiet and gather honey once more. They whispered often to each other.  \"Do you know where we are going?\" one said.    \"Sh!\" was the answer. \"The guides are looking for a good place now.\"    \"I wish the Queen Mother knew where we are going,\" said the first.    \"How could she?\" replied the second. \"You know very well that she has  not left the hive since she began to lay eggs. Here she comes now.\"    \"Oh dear!\" exclaimed the Queen Mother. \"I can never stand this. I  certainly cannot. To think I am not allowed to rule in my own hive! The  Workers who are guarding the royal cells drive me away whenever I go  near them. I will not stay any longer.\"    \"Then,\" said a Drone, as though he had thought of it for the first time,  \"why don't you go away?\"    \"I shall,\" said she. \"Will you go with me?\"    \"No,\" said the Drone. \"I hate moving and furnishing a new house.  Besides, somebody must stay here to take care of the Workers and the  young Queen.\"    The Queen Mother walked away. \"When we were both young,\" she said to  herself, \"he would have gone anywhere with me.\"    And the Drone said to himself, \"Now, isn't that just like a Queen  Mother! She has known all the time that there would be young Queens  coming on, and that she would have to leave, yet here she is, making the  biggest kind of fuss about it. She ought to remember that it is the  law.\"    Indeed she should have remembered that it was the law, for everything is  done by law in the hive, and no one person should find fault. The law  looks after them all, and will not let any one have more than his  rightful share.    That same afternoon there was a sudden quiet in their home. The Workers  who had been outside returned and visited with the rest. While they were  waiting, a few who were to be their guides came to the door of the hive,  struck their wings together, and gave the signal for starting. Then all  who were going with the Queen Mother hurried out of the door and flew  with her in circles overhead. \"Good-bye!\" they called. \"Raise all the  young Queens you wish. We shall never come back. We are going far, far  away, and we shall not tell you where. It is a lovely place, a very  lovely place.\"    \"Let them go,\" said the Drones who stayed behind. \"Now, isn't it time to  let out the young Queen?\"    \"Not yet,\" answered a Worker, who stood near the door. \"Not one feeler  shall she put outside her cell until that swarm is out of sight.\"    The tender-hearted Worker came up wiping her eyes. \"Oh, that poor Queen  Mother!\" said she. \"I am so sorry for her. I positively cannot gather  honey to-day, I feel so badly about her going.\"    \"Better keep on working,\" said her friend. \"It's the best thing in the  world for that sad feeling. Besides, you should try to keep strong.\"    \"Oh, I will try to eat something from the comb,\" was the answer, \"but I  don't feel like working.\"    \"Zzzt!\" said the other Worker. \"I think if you can eat, you can hunt  your food outside, and not take honey we have laid up for winter or food  that will be needed for the children.\"    The Drones chuckled. It was all right for them to be lazy, they thought,  but they never could bear to see a Worker waste time. \"Ah,\" cried one of  them suddenly, \"what is the new swarm doing now?\"    The words were hardly out of his mouth when the Queen Mother crawled  into the hive again. \"Such dreadful luck!\" said she. \"A cloud passed  over the sun just as we were alighting on a tree to rest.\"    \"I wouldn't have come back for that,\" said a Drone.    \"No,\" said she, in her airiest way, \"I dare say you wouldn't, but I  would. I dare not go to a new home after a cloud has passed over the  sun. I think it is a sign of bad luck. I should never expect a single  egg to hatch if I went on. We shall try it again to-morrow.\"    All the others came back with her, and the hive was once more crowded  and hot. \"Oh dear!\" said the tender-hearted Worker, \"isn't it too bad to  think they couldn't go?\"    The next morning they started again and were quite as excited over it as  before. The Queen Mother had fussed and fidgeted all the time, although  she had laid nine hundred and seventy-three eggs while waiting, and that  in spite of interruptions. \"Being busy keeps me from thinking,\" said  she, \"and I must do something.\" This time the Queen Mother lighted on an  apple-tree branch, and the others clung to her until all who had left  the hive were in a great mass on the branch,--a mass as large as a small  cabbage. They meant to rest a little while and then fly away to the new  home chosen by their guides.    While they were hanging here, the farmer came under the tree, carrying  a long pole with a wire basket fastened to the upper end. He shook the  clustered Bees gently into it, and then changed them into an empty hive  that stood beside their old home.    \"Now,\" said the Workers who had stayed in the old hive, \"we will let out  the new Queen, for the Queen Mother will never return.\"    It did not take long to bite away the waxen wall and let her out. Then  they gathered around and caressed her, and touched their feelers to her  and waited upon her, and explained why they could not let her out  sooner. She was still a soft gray color, like all young Bees when they  first come from the cell, but this soon changed to the black worn by her  people.    The Workers flew in and out, and brought news from the hive next door.  They could not go there, for the law does not allow a Bee who lives in  one home to visit in another, but they met their old friends in the air  or when they were sipping honey. They found that the Queen Mother had  quite given up the idea of living elsewhere and was as busy as ever. The  farmer had put a piece of comb into the new hive so that she could begin  housekeeping at once.    The new Queen was petted and kept at home until she was strong and used  to moving about. That was not long. Then she said she wanted to see the  world outside. \"We will go with you,\" said the Drones, who were always  glad of an excuse for flying away in pleasant weather. They said there  was so much noise and hurrying around in the hive that they could never  get any real rest there during the daytime.    So the young Queen flew far away and saw the beautiful world for the  first time. Such a blue sky! Such green grass! Such fine trees covered  with sweet-smelling blossoms! She loved it all as soon as she saw it.  \"Ah,\" she cried, \"what a wonderful thing it is to live and see all this!  I am so glad that I was hatched. But now I must hurry home, for there is  so much to be done.\"    She was a fine young Queen, and the Bees were all proud of her. They let  her do anything she wished as long as she kept away from the royal  cells. She soon began to work as the old Queen Mother had done, and was  very happy in her own way. She would have liked to open the royal cells  and prevent more Queens from hatching, and when they told her it was the  law which made them keep her away, she still wanted to bite into them.    \"That poor young Queen Mother!\" sighed the tender-hearted Worker. \"I am  so sorry for her when she is kept away from the royal cells. This is a  sad, sad world!\" But this isn't a sad world by any means. It is a  beautiful, sunshiny, happy world, and neither Queen Bees nor anybody  else should think it hard if they cannot do every single thing they  wish. The law looks after great and small, and there is no use in  pouting because we cannot do one certain thing, when there is any amount  of delightful work and play awaiting us. And the young Queen Mother knew  this.          THE BAY COLT LEARNS TO MIND      The span of Bays were talking together in their stalls, and the other  Horses were listening. That was one trouble with living in the barn, you  could not say anything to your next-door neighbor without somebody else  hearing. The farmer had solid walls between the stalls, with openings so  far back that no Horse could get his head to them without breaking his  halter. This had been done to keep them from biting each other, and as  nobody but the Dappled Gray ever thought of doing such a thing, it was  rather hard on the rest. It made it difficult for the mothers to bring  up their children properly, for after a Colt was old enough to have a  stall to himself, his mother had to call out her advice and warnings so  loudly that everybody could hear, and you know it is not well to reprove  a child before company if it can be helped. Indeed, it was this very  question that was troubling the span of Bays now. Each of them had a  two-year-old Colt, and they knew that it was nearly time for the farmer  to put these Colts "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19389"],[0,"Child Songs of Cheer (#6)"],[1," The friendship of the fairy folks        To fold thee from all harm.

THE THREE CANDLES          When the Christmas-tide drew nigh,      On a shelf three candles bright,      Two were red and one was white,      Waited for who came to buy.        Said the first one, \"I shall be      Chosen for a Christmas-tree!\"      Said the second, \"I shall light      Christ Jesus on His way to-night!\"      Then the third one sighed, \"Ah me,      I know not what my lot will be!\"        When the dark fell, bright and gay      The first candle burned away,      Red as all the berries red      On the holly overhead,      While the children in their glee      Danced around the Christmas-tree.        And the second, twinkling bright,      Poured forth all its golden light      Through a window decked with green      Garlands and red ribbons' sheen,      So the Christ-child when He came      Might be guided by its flame.        But the third one in the gloom      Of a bare and cheerless room      Softly burned where long had lain      A poor little child in pain,      And the baby in its bed      By the light was comforted.        When the Christ-child passed that night      All three candles gave Him light,      But the brightest was the spark      By the baby in the dark."]]]
