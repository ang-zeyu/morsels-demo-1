We were given a special exhibition and saw as many as thirty of the  aeroplanes go through maneuvers. I was struck by the deafening noise  made when the machines arose. One accident occurred while we were there;  a machine got out of order and fell to the ground, seriously injuring  two of the aviators in charge. The average is one death daily. During  the maneuvers a real war call came from the front and four of the  largest machines started off. These aeroplanes travel at the rate of  over one hundred miles an hour and can reach the front in from twelve to  fifteen minutes from Paris. Since these aviators have been guarding  Paris, the Germans have given up sending their machines over that city.  The plant at the camp manufactures fifty aeroplanes daily.    After this notable aviation exhibition, we called on Robert Bliss,  Charge de'affaires at the American Embassy, Mr. Sharp being absent.    On this day we had our first experience in government automobiles. Five  military automobiles were placed at our disposal with soldiers for  chauffeurs, two in charge of each machine. These automobiles are large  and powerful and hold seven persons. In them we saw many interesting  sights about Paris and in that section of France, only a few of which  may be described.          IV.    MEETING ENGLAND'S PREMIER      On Sunday, September 10th, I had the good fortune to meet Lloyd George.  He had been paying a visit to General Joffre, and was registered at the  same hotel as the Commission. Through his secretary, and through the  persistence of some of the commissioners, arrangements were made to meet  this celebrated man. I happened to be the first one of the commissioners  introduced. During my youthful days, while a clerk in a company store at  Niles, Ohio, I had learned some Welsh, and in this language I greeted  Lloyd George. He seemed surprised and was kind enough to remark \"That is  very good Welsh\". This put me in close touch with him and I had quite a  conversation. He fired questions quite rapidly. He asked me what  business I was in and at the same time what chances Hughes had for being  elected. I told him I had been in the steel business for a great many  years, and that I was a delegate to the convention which nominated  Hughes. I told him I had heard Mr. Hughes' father preach at Mineral  Ridge, a suburb of Niles. All the other commissioners were introduced.  During the interview, Mr. George made this remark:    \"I hope your mission will be successful and help France; I hope you  can also help England, and when we have settled our little  difficulties, help Germany. The world is big enough for us all.\"    Mr. George spoke very kindly to me of both Hughes and Roosevelt, and at  the close of the interview said with earnestness:    \"We are fighting the battle for all civilization. We are fighting  for you as well as for ourselves, and you are deeply interested.\"    I had the impression that the famous Englishman was of large stature,  but was mistaken. He is a man about five feet, five inches tall, of  slender build, with keen, penetrating eye and somewhat nervous manner;  he is certainly one of the great men of the world.    In the afternoon with Dr. Mailloux, a member of the Commission, I paid a  visit to General Gosselin, formerly chief of munitions, who had been in  America on business for the French Government. He spoke very highly of  the steel material furnished by the various American manufacturing  plants, and said it would have been impossible for the French to succeed  as they had without this help. He urged the shipping of steel on  contracts with all possible dispatch. General Gosselin is an important  personage, quiet and modest. I was told he had already been of great  service to his country.    [Illustration: Lloyd George, Who Says \"England is Fighting a Battle for  Civilization.\"]    In the evening we visited \"Le Phare de France,\" or \"The Light House of  France.\" This is one of the noblest of the many humane institutions  being maintained in France by American means. It is under the management  of Miss Winifred Holt, who represents the New York Association for the  Blind, and is doing an angel's work among the men blinded in battle, of  whom there are more in this war than in any other in history, owing to  the many new methods employed and the manner in which battles are  fought. Miss Holt is known as \"Keeper of the Light House,\" and is much  beloved in France. She is a most engaging young woman and deserves all  the kind things said about her by the admiring French. Miss Holt is ably  assisted by Miss Cleveland, the charming daughter of the late President  Cleveland.    This institution is under the direct patronage of the President of  France and a committee composed of the highest officials of that  country, although the funds to support it are contributed by wealthy  Americans, prominent among whom are the Crockers, of San Francisco. In  it the men whose sight has been destroyed are being taught useful  occupations and cheered with the hope that they will be able to earn a  living. They are also taught to read letters for the blind and thus some  of the everlasting darkness to which they had been condemned by the  horrors of war is dispelled. It is said that many men who could with  difficulty be kept from committing suicide in their despair have become  cheerful since entering this institution.    [Illustration: Miss Winifred Holt, \"Keeper of the Light House of  France.\"]    On Monday we visited the famous china establishment Sevres. This is one  of the oldest works of the kind in France and its product is known  everywhere. The plant has now been taken over by the government and used  for making gas containers and other accessories used by the army.    Following the visit to Sevres we were entertained in Paris at luncheon  by the Circle Republican. On my right sat David Mennet, President of the  Paris Chamber of Commerce; on my left sat Monsieur Laffere, Deputy  Minister of Labor. Much valuable information was obtained from both of  these gentlemen, but it was not of a nature to be recorded.    In the afternoon we visited the famous Renault automobile plant. This  plant has been taken over by the government and is employed in making  war materials, automobile trucks, automobiles for military use and  munitions. The plant employs twelve thousand men and five thousand  women. They are engaged twelve hours daily, with one hour off at noon  for luncheon. This was our first visit to a munition plant and we were  cautioned to be careful in what we might record concerning what we saw.  I was struck by the earnestness of the workmen; the expression on their  countenances could be universally interpreted, \"We are working for  France\". After this visit to the Renault plant we inspected the plant of  Andre Citroon, a Hollander, but a generalle in Paris. He manufactures  munitions only, employing seven thousand, five hundred women and  twenty-five hundred men. In both of these plants we saw piles of steel  made in America and labeled \"Youngstown\", \"Pittsburgh\", \"Harrisburg\" or  \"Cleveland\".    In the evening we were given a banquet by the American Chamber of  Commerce at the Hotel Palais d'Orsay. On my right sat Consul General  Thackara, whom I had known for a great many years. His wife was a  daughter of the late General Sherman, who said, it will be remembered,  \"War is Hell\". In view of what we saw later I think he was quite right.  On my left was First Secretary of Legation, American Embassy, Arthur  Hugh Frazier.    The Herald gives an account of this banquet as follows:    Between ninety and a hundred members of the American colony in  Paris met at the Hotel Palais d'Orsay yesterday evening at a  banquet given by the American Chamber of Commerce for the  delegation of the American Manufacturers' Export Association, which  has just arrived in France.    The large dining-hall of the hotel was tastefully decorated with  roses, carnations and dahlias, and hardly a seat was vacant when  dinner was served, about eight o'clock.    After an excellent dinner, which began with \"Tortue clair\" and went on  by easy stages from \"Langouste muscovite\" and an excellent \"Baron de  Pauillac\" to the \"Parfait glace Palais d'Orsay\", and dessert, Judge  Walter V. R. Berry, Vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce in Paris,  and acting as chairman in the absence of the president, Mr. Percy  Peixotto, addressed the company, as follows:    We have all heard so often about the caravels of Columbus and about  the Mayflower that, perhaps a hundred years from now, in a  brand-new Palais d'Orsay Hotel, an eloquent member of the Chamber  of Commerce will refer to nineteen hundred and sixteen as the year  in which the good ship Lafayette brought over for the first time a  great American Industrial Commission to explore Darkest France.    Anyone who views with a philosophic mind the tremendous cataclysm  that is convulsing the world must reach this conclusion: that its  results will be more profound, more far-reaching, more epoch-making  than were the results of the Revolution of 1789.    Where, under the new conditions, will the United States find  itself?    It is a difficult problem to solve; but if one cannot answer, it  will be at least a step forward to put the right questions.  Gentlemen of the Commission, it is for you, on your return to  America, to formulate these questions.    Heretofore it has been impossible to get together in Europe a  delegation of Americans, each one of whom was ready to sink his  private interests. This is the first time that an American  Commission has come abroad, forgetting the individual, looking  only to the welfare of the State.    Gentlemen, I congratulate you on your public spirit and your  patriotism. I congratulate you, too, on your opportunity, the  magnificent opportunity of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20467"],[0,"Handbook of the Trees of New England (#6)"],[1,"insects or disease; difficult to transplant and not common  in nurseries.

Indigenous in the northern parts of Scotland and in the Alps, and from  Sweden and Norway, where it forms large forests eastward throughout  northern Europe and Asia.    At Southington, Conn., many of these trees, probably originating from an  introduced pine in the vicinity, were formerly scattered over a rocky  pasture and in the adjoining woods, a tract of about two acres in  extent. Most of these were cut down in 1898, but the survivors, if left  to themselves, will doubtless multiply rapidly, as the conditions have  proved very favorable (C. H. Bissell _in lit._, 1899).    Like _P. resinosa_ and _P. Banksiana_, it has its foliage leaves in  twos, with neither of which, however, is it likely to be confounded;  aside from the habit, which is quite different, it may be distinguished  from the former by the shortness of its leaves, which are less than 2  inches long, while those of _P. resinosa_ are 5 or 6; and from the  latter by the position of its cones, which point outward and downward at  maturity, while those of _P. Banksiana_ follow the direction of the  twig.      Picea nigra, Link.    _Picea Mariana, B. S. P. (including Picea brevifolia, Peck)._    BLACK SPRUCE. SWAMP SPRUCE. DOUBLE SPRUCE. WATER SPRUCE.    =Habitat and Range.=--Swamps, sphagnum bogs, shores of rivers and ponds,  wet, rocky hillsides; not uncommon, especially northward, on dry uplands  and mountain slopes.         Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, westward beyond the Rocky       mountains, extending northward along the tributaries of the Yukon       in Alaska.    Maine,--common throughout, covering extensive areas almost to the  exclusion of other trees in the central and northern sections,  occasional on the top of Katahdin (5215 feet); New Hampshire and  Vermont,--common in sphagnum swamps of low and high altitudes; the dwarf  form, var. _semi-prostrata_, occurs on the summit of Mt. Mansfield  (_Flora of Vermont_, 1900); Massachusetts,--frequent; Rhode Island,--not  reported; Connecticut,--rare; on north shore of Spectacle ponds in Kent  (Litchfield county), at an elevation of 1200 feet; Newton (Fairfield  county), a few scattered trees in a swamp at an altitude of 400 feet:  (New Haven county) a few small trees at Bethany; at Middlebury abundant  in a swamp of five acres (E. B. Harger, _Rhodora_, II, 126).         South along the mountains to North Carolina and Tennessee; west       through the northern tier of states to Minnesota.    =Habit.=--In New England, usually a small, slender tree, 10-30 feet high  and 5-8 inches in diameter; attaining northward and westward much  greater dimensions; reduced at high elevation to a shrub or dwarf tree,  2 or 3 feet high; trunk tapering very slowly, forming a narrow-based,  conical, more or less irregular head; branches rather short, scarcely  whorled, horizontal or more frequently declining with an upward tendency  at the ends, often growing in open swamps almost to the ground, the  lowest prostrate, sometimes rooting at their tips and sending up shoots;  spray stiff and rather slender; foliage dark bluish-green or glaucous.  This tree often begins to blossom after attaining a height of 2-5 feet,  the terminal cones each season remaining persistent at the base of the  branches, sometimes for many years.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk grayish-brown, separating into rather close, thin  scales; branchlets roughened with the footstalks of the fallen leaves;  twigs in autumn dull reddish-brown with a minute, erect, pale, rusty  pubescence, or nearly smooth.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds scaly, ovate, pointed, reddish-brown.  Leaves scattered, needle-shaped, dark bluish-green, the upper sides  becoming yellowish in the sunlight, the faces marked by parallel rows of  minute bluish dots which sometimes give a glaucous effect to the lower  surface or even the whole leaf on the new shoots, 4-angled, 1/4-3/4 of  an inch long, straight or slightly incurved, blunt at the apex, abruptly  tipped or mucronate, sessile on persistent, decurrent footstalks.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May, a week or two earlier than the red  spruce; sterile flowers terminal or axillary, on wood of the preceding  year; about 3/8 inch long, ovate; anthers madder-red: fertile flowers at  or near end of season's shoots, erect; scales madder-red, spirally  imbricated, broader than long, margin erose, rarely entire.    =Fruit.=--Cones, single or clustered at or near ends of the season's  shoots, attached to the upper side of the twig, but turning downward by  the twisting of the stout stalk, often persistent for years; 1/2-1-1/2  inches long; purplish or grayish brown at the end of the first season,  finally becoming dull reddish or grayish brown, ovate, ovate-oval, or  nearly globular when open; scales rigid, thin, reddish on the inner  surface; margin rounded, uneven, eroded, bifid, or rarely entire.    =Horticultural Value.=--Best adapted to cool, moist soils; of little  value under cultivation; young plants seldom preserving the broad-based,  cone-like, symmetrical heads common in the spruce swamps, the lower  branches dying out and the whole tree becoming scraggly and unsightly.  Seldom offered by nurserymen.    [Illustration: PLATE VI.--Picea nigra.]      1. Branch with sterile flowers.    2. Stamen, front view.    3. Stamen, side view.    4. Stamen, top view.    5.

Picea nigra, var. rubra, Engelm._    RED SPRUCE.    =Habitat and Range.=--Cool, rich woods, well-drained valleys, slopes of  mountains, not infrequently extending down to the borders of swamps.         Prince Edward island and Nova Scotia, along the valley of the St.       Lawrence.    Maine,--throughout: most common towards the coast and in the  extreme north, thus forming a belt around the central area, where  it is often quite wanting except on cool or elevated slopes; New  Hampshire,--throughout; the most abundant conifer of upper Coos, the  White mountain region where it climbs to the alpine area, and the higher  parts of the Connecticut-Merrimac watershed; Vermont,--throughout; the  common spruce of the Green mountains, often in dense groves on rocky  slopes with thin soil; Massachusetts,--common in the mountainous regions  of Berkshire county and on uplands in the northern sections, occasional  southward; Rhode Island and Connecticut,--not reported.         South along the Alleghanies to Georgia, ascending to an altitude of       4500 feet in the Adirondacks, and 4000-5000 feet in West Virginia;       west through the northern tier of states to Minnesota.    =Habit.=--A hardy tree, 40-75 feet high; trunk 1-2-1/2 feet in diameter,  straight, tapering very slowly; branches longer than those of the black  spruce, irregularly whorled or scattered, the lower often declined,  sometimes resting on the ground, the upper rising toward the light,  forming while the tree is young a rather regular, narrow, conical head,  which in old age and in bleak mountain regions becomes, by the loss of  branches, less symmetrical but more picturesque; foliage dark  yellowish-green.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk smoothish and mottled on young trees, at length  separating into small, thin, flat, reddish scales; in old trees striate  with shallow sinuses, separating into ashen-white plates, often  partially detached; spray reddish or yellowish white in autumn with  minute, erect, pale rusty pubescence.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds scaly, conical, brownish, 1/3 inch long.  Leaves solitary, at first closely appressed around the young shoots,  ultimately pointing outward, those on the underside often twisting  upward, giving a brush-like appearance to the twig, 1/2-3/4 inch long,  straight or curved (curvature more marked than in _P. nigra_),  needle-shaped, dark yellowish-green, 4-angled; apex blunt or more or  less pointed, often mucronate; base blunt; sessile on persistent  leaf-cushions.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Sterile flowers terminal or axillary on wood of  the preceding year, 1/2-3/4 inch long, cylindrical; anthers pinkish-red:  fertile flowers lateral along previous season's shoots, erect; scales  madder-purple, spirally imbricated, broader than long, margin entire or  slightly erose.    =Fruit.=--Cones; single or clustered, lateral along the previous  season's shoots, recurved, mostly pointing downward at various angles,  on short stalks, falling the first autumn but sometimes persistent a  year longer, 1-2 inches long (usually larger than those of _P. nigra_),  reddish-brown, mostly ovate; scales thin, stiff, rounded; margin entire  or slightly irregular.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; adapts itself to a  great variety of soils and lives to a great age. Its narrow-based  conical form, dense foliage, and yellow green coloring form an effective  contrast with most other evergreens. It grows, however, slowly, is  subject to the loss of its lower branches and to disfigurement by  insects. Seldom offered in nurseries.    [Illustration: PLATE VII.--Picea rubra.]      1.
