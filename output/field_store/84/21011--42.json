The interval between the two tones may therefore  be either a half-step or a whole-step.         Whether the trill is to begin with the principal tone       (represented by the printed note) or with the one above is a       matter of some dispute among theorists and performers, but it       may safely be said that the majority of modern writers on the       subject would have it begin on the principal tone rather than       on the tone above. Fig. 40.         When the principal note is preceded by a small note on the       degree above, it is of course understood that the trill begins       on the tone above. Fig. 41.    The trill is indicated by the sign [trill symbol].    [Illustration: Fig. 40.]    [Illustration: Fig. 41.]    The above examples would be termed _perfect trills_ because they close  with a turn. By inference, an _imperfect trill_ is one closing without a  turn.    66. The _mordent_ [mordent symbol] consists of three tones; first the  one represented by the printed note; second the one next below it in the  diatonic scale; third the one represented by the printed note again.    [Illustration: Fig. 42.]    67. The _double (or long) mordent_ has five tones (sometimes seven)  instead of three, the first two of the three tones of the regular  mordent being repeated once or more. (See Fig. 43.)    In the case of both mordent and double-mordent the tones are sounded as  quickly as possible, the time taken by the embellishment being  subtracted from the value of the principal note as printed.    [Illustration: Fig. 43.]    68. The _inverted mordent_ [inverted mordent symbol] (note the absence  of the vertical line) is like the mordent except that the tone below is  replaced by the tone above in each case. This ornament is sometimes  called a \"transient shake\" because it is really only a part of the more  elaborate grace called \"trill.\" (See Fig. 44.)    [Illustration: Fig. 44.]         The confusion at present attending the interpretation of the       last two embellishments described, might be largely obviated       if the suggestion of a recent writer[11] to call the one the       _upward mordent_, and the other the _downward mordent_ were to       be universally adopted.    [Footnote 11: Elson--Dictionary of Music, article _mordent_.]    69. The _turn_ consists of four tones; first, the diatonic scale-tone  above the principal tone; second, the principal tone itself; third, the  tone below the principal tone; and fourth, the principal tone again.    When the sign ([turn symbol] or [fancy turn symbol]) occurs over a note  of small value in rapid tempo (Fig. 45) the turn consists of four tones  of equal value; but if it occurs over a note of greater value, or in a  slow tempo, the tones are usually played quickly (like the mordent), and  the fourth tone is then held until the time-value of the note has  expired. (Fig. 46.)    [Illustration: Fig. 45.]    [Illustration: Fig. 46.]    70. _When the turn-sign is placed a little to the right of the note_ the  principal tone is sounded first and held to almost its full time-value,  then the turn is played just before the next tone of the melody. In this  case the four tones are of equal length as in the first example. (See  Fig. 47.)    [Illustration: Fig. 47.]         The student should note the difference between these two       effects; in the case of a turn _over_ the note the turn comes       at the beginning, but in the case of the sign _after_ the note       the turn comes at the very end. But in both cases the time       taken by the embellishment is taken from the time-value of       the principal note. For further details see Grove's Dictionary       of Music and Musicians, Vol. V, p. 184. Also Elson, op. cit.       p. 274.    71. Sometimes an accidental occurs with the turn, and in this case when  written above the sign it refers to the highest tone of the turn, but  when written below, to the lowest (Fig. 48).    [Illustration: Fig. 48.]    72. In the _inverted turn_ the order of tones is reversed, the lowest  one coming first, the principal tone next, the highest tone third, and  the principal tone again, last.    [Illustration: Fig. 49.]    73. The _appoggiatura_ (lit. _leaning note_) consists of an ornamental  tone introduced before a tone of a melody, thus delaying the melody tone  until the ornamental tone has been heard. The time taken for this  ornamental tone is taken from that of the melody tone.         The appoggiatura was formerly classified into _long       appoggiatura_ and _short appoggiatura_, but modern writers       seem to consider the term \"short appoggiatura\" to be       synonymous with acciaccatura[12], and to avoid confusion the       word _acciaccatura_ will be used in this sense, and defined       under its own heading.    [Footnote 12: In organ music the acciaccatura is still taken to mean  that the embellishing tone and the melody tone are to be sounded  together, the former being then instantly released, while the latter is  held to its full time-value.]    74. Three rules for the interpretation of the appoggiatura are commonly  cited, viz.:         (1) When it is possible to divide the principal tone into       halves, then the appoggiatura receives one-half the value of       the printed note. (Fig. 50.)         (2) When the principal note is dotted (division into halves       being therefore not possible), the appoggiatura receives       two-thirds of the value. (Fig. 51.)         (3) When the principal note is tied to a note of smaller       denomination the appoggiatura receives the value of the first       of the two notes. (Fig. 52.)    [Illustration: Fig. 50.]    [Illustration: Fig. 51.]    [Illustration: Fig. 52.]    75. The _acciaccatura_ (or short appoggiatura) is written like the  appoggiatura except that it has a light stroke across its stem.  [Illustration] It has no definite duration-value, but is sounded as  quickly as possible, taking its time from that of the principal tone.  The appoggiatura is always accented, but the acciaccatura never is, the  stress always falling on the melody tone. (See Grove, op. cit. Vol. I,  p. 96.)         The use of embellishments is on the wane, and the student of       to-day needs the above information only to aid him in the       interpretation of music written in previous centuries. In the       early days of instrumental music it was necessary to introduce       graces of all sorts because the instruments in use were not       capable of sustaining tone for any length of time; but with       the advent of the modern piano with its comparatively great       sustaining power, and also with the advent in vocal music of a       new style of singing (German Lieder singing as contrasted with       Italian coloratura singing), ornamental tones were used less       and less, and when found now are usually written out in full       in the score instead of being indicated by signs.          CHAPTER VII    SCALES      76. A _scale_ (from _scala_, a Latin word meaning _ladder_; Ger.  _Ton-leiter_) is an ascending or descending series of tones, progressing  according to some definite system, and all bearing (in the case of  tonality scales at least) a very intimate relation to the first  tone--the _key-tone_ or _tonic_. (See p. 28, Sec. 78; also note 1 at  bottom of p. 38.)         Many different kinds of scales have existed in various musical       eras, the point of resemblance among them all being the fact       that they have all more or less recognized the _octave_ as the       natural limit of the series. The difference among the various       scales has been in the selection of intervals between the       scale-tones, and, consequently, in the number of tones within       the octave. Thus _e.g._, in our major scale the intervals       between the tones are all whole-steps except two (which are       half-steps), and the result is a scale of _eight_ tones       (including in this number both the key-tone and its octave):       but in the so-called _pentatonic_ scale of the Chinese and       other older civilizations we find larger intervals (_e.g._,       the step-and-a-half), and consequently a smaller number of       tones within the octave. Thus in the scale upon which many of       the older Scotch folk songs are based the intervals are       arranged as follows:         1  whole  2  whole  3  step-and-  4  whole  5  step-and-  6          step      step      a-half        step      a-half         The result is a scale of six tones, corresponding       approximately with C--D--E--G--A--C in our modern system.         The term _pentatonic_ is thus seen to be a misnomer since the       sixth tone is necessary for the completion of the series, just       as the eighth tone is essential in our diatonic scales.         The following Chinese tune (called \"Jasmine\") is based on the       pentatonic scale.         [Illustration]    77. In studying the theory of the scale the student should bear in mind  the fact that a scale is not an arbitrary series of tones which some one  has invented, and which others are required to make use of. It is rather  the result of accustoming the ear to certain melodic combinations (which  were originally hit upon by accident), and finally analyzing and  systematizing these combinations into a certain definite order or  arrangement. The application of this idea may be verified when it is  recalled that most primitive peoples have invented melodies of some  sort, but that only in modern times, and particularly since the  development of instrumental music, have these melodies been analyzed,  and the scale upon which they have been based, discovered, the inventors  of the melodies being themselves wholly ignorant of the existence of  such scales.    78. A _key_ is a number of tones grouping themselves naturally (both  melodically and harmonically) about a central tone--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#6)"],[1," who had brought  the rope and grappling-hooks to the house in which I had been first  received, and which, as I afterwards learned, was the residence of  the chief magistrate of the tribe. The child, whose name was Taee  (pronounced Tar-ee), was the magistrate's eldest son. I found that  during my last sleep or trance I had made still greater advance in the  language of the country, and could converse with comparative ease and  fluency.    This child was singularly handsome, even for the beautiful race to which  he belonged, with a countenance very manly in aspect for his years, and  with a more vivacious and energetic expression than I had hitherto seen  in the serene and passionless faces of the men. He brought me the tablet  on which I had drawn the mode of my descent, and had also sketched the  head of the horrible reptile that had scared me from my friend's corpse.  Pointing to that part of the drawing, Taee put to me a few questions  respecting the size and form of the monster, and the cave or chasm from  which it had emerged. His interest in my answers seemed so grave as  to divert him for a while from any curiosity as to myself or my  antecedents. But to my great embarrassment, seeing how I was pledged to  my host, he was just beginning to ask me where I came from, when Zee,  fortunately entered, and, overhearing him, said, \"Taee, give to our  guest any information he may desire, but ask none from him in return. To  question him who he is, whence he comes, or wherefore he is here, would  be a breach of the law which my father has laid down in this house.\"    \"So be it,\" said Taee, pressing his hand to his breast; and from that  moment, till the one in which I saw him last, this child, with whom I  became very intimate, never once put to me any of the questions thus  interdicted.        Chapter IX.      It was not for some time, and until, by repeated trances, if they are to  be so called, my mind became better prepared to interchange ideas with  my entertainers, and more fully to comprehend differences of manners  and customs, at first too strange to my experience to be seized by my  reason, that I was enabled to gather the following details respecting  the origin and history of the subterranean population, as portion of one  great family race called the Ana.    According to the earliest traditions, the remote progenitors of the  race had once tenanted a world above the surface of that in which their  descendants dwelt. Myths of that world were still preserved in their  archives, and in those myths were legends of a vaulted dome in which the  lamps were lighted by no human hand. But such legends were considered by  most commentators as allegorical fables. According to these traditions  the earth itself, at the date to which the traditions ascend, was not  indeed in its infancy, but in the throes and travail of transition  from one form of development to another, and subject to many violent  revolutions of nature. By one of such revolutions, that portion of the  upper world inhabited by the ancestors of this race had been subjected  to inundations, not rapid, but gradual and uncontrollable, in which all,  save a scanty remnant, were submerged and perished. Whether this be  a record of our historical and sacred Deluge, or of some earlier one  contended for by geologists, I do not pretend to conjecture; though,  according to the chronology of this people as compared with that of  Newton, it must have been many thousands of years before the time of  Noah. On the other hand, the account of these writers does not harmonise  with the opinions most in vogue among geological authorities, inasmuch  as it places the existence of a human race upon earth at dates long  anterior to that assigned to the terrestrial formation adapted to the  introduction of mammalia. A band of the ill-fated race, thus invaded by  the Flood, had, during the march of the waters, taken refuge in caverns  amidst the loftier rocks, and, wandering through these hollows, they  lost sight of the upper world forever. Indeed, the whole face of the  earth had been changed by this great revulsion; land had been turned  into sea--sea into land. In the bowels of the inner earth, even now,  I was informed as a positive fact, might be discovered the remains of  human habitation--habitation not in huts and caverns, but in vast cities  whose ruins attest the civilisation of races which flourished before  the age of Noah, and are not to be classified with those genera to which  philosophy ascribes the use of flint and the ignorance of iron.    The fugitives had carried with them the knowledge of the arts they had  practised above ground--arts of culture and civilisation. Their earliest  want must have been that of supplying below the earth the light they had  lost above it; and at no time, even in the traditional period, do the  races, of which the one I now sojourned with formed a tribe, seem to  have been unacquainted with the art of extracting light from gases, or  manganese, or petroleum. They had been accustomed in their former state  to contend with the rude forces of nature; and indeed the lengthened  battle they had fought with their conqueror Ocean, which had taken  centuries in its spread, had quickened their skill in curbing waters  into dikes and channels. To this skill they owed their preservation in  their new abode. \"For many generations,\" said my host, with a sort  of contempt and horror, \"these primitive forefathers are said to have  degraded their rank and shortened their lives by eating the flesh of  animals, many varieties of which had, like themselves, escaped the  Deluge, and sought shelter in the hollows of the earth; other animals,  supposed to be unknown to the upper world, those hollows themselves  produced.\"    When what we should term the historical age emerged from the twilight  of tradition, the Ana were already established in different communities,  and had attained to a degree of civilisation very analogous to that  which the more advanced nations above the earth now enjoy. They  were familiar with most of our mechanical inventions, including the  application of steam as well as gas. The communities were in fierce  competition with each other. They had their rich and their poor; they  had orators and conquerors; they made war either for a domain or  an idea. Though the various states acknowledged various forms of  government, free institutions were beginning to preponderate; popular  assemblies increased in power; republics soon became general; the  democracy to which the most enlightened European politicians look  forward as the extreme goal of political advancement, and which  still prevailed among other subterranean races, whom they despised as  barbarians, the loftier family of Ana, to which belonged the tribe I was  visiting, looked back to as one of the crude and ignorant experiments  which belong to the infancy of political science. It was the age of envy  and hate, of fierce passions, of constant social changes more or less  violent, of strife between classes, of war between state and state. This  phase of society lasted, however, for some ages, and was finally brought  to a close, at least among the nobler and more intellectual  populations, by the gradual discovery of the latent powers stored in the  all-permeating fluid which they denominate Vril.    According to the account I received from Zee, who, as an erudite  professor of the College of Sages, had studied such matters more  diligently than any other member of my host's family, this fluid is  capable of being raised and disciplined into the mightiest agency over  all forms of matter, animate or inanimate. It can destroy like the flash  of lightning; yet, differently applied, it can replenish or invigorate  life, heal, and preserve, and on it they chiefly rely for the cure  of disease, or rather for enabling the physical organisation to  re-establish the due equilibrium of its natural powers, and thereby  to cure itself. By this agency they rend way through the most solid  substances, and open valleys for culture through the rocks of their  subterranean wilderness. From it they extract the light which supplies  their lamps, finding it steadier, softer, and healthier than the other  inflammable materials they had formerly used.    But the effects of the alleged discovery of the means to direct the more  terrible force of vril were chiefly remarkable in their influence upon  social polity. As these effects became familiarly known and skillfully  administered, war between the vril-discoverers ceased, for they brought  the art of destruction to such perfection as to annul all superiority in  numbers, discipline, or military skill. The fire lodged in the hollow  of a rod directed by the hand of a child could shatter the strongest  fortress, or cleave its burning way from the van to the rear of an  embattled host. If army met army, and both had command of this agency,  it could be but to the annihilation of each. The age of war was  therefore gone, but with the cessation of war other effects bearing  upon the social state soon became apparent. Man was so completely at  the mercy of man, each whom he encountered being able, if so willing,  to slay him on the instant, that all notions of government by force  gradually vanished from political systems and forms of law. It is only  by force that vast communities, dispersed through great distances of  space, can be kept together; but now there was no longer either the  necessity of self-preservation or the pride of aggrandisement to make  one state desire to preponderate in population over another.    The Vril-discoverers thus, in the course of a few generations,  peacefully split into communities of moderate size. The tribe amongst  which I had fallen was limited to 12,000 families. Each tribe occupied  a territory sufficient for all its wants, and at stated periods the  surplus population departed to seek a realm"]]]
