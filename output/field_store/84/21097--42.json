But Striped Chipmunk just flirted his funny little tail and winked with  both his bright eyes at them.    \"Busy!  busy!  busy!\" said Striped Chipmunk, hurrying along as fast as  his short legs could take him.    The Merry Little Breezes laughed, and one of them, dancing ahead,  pulled the funny little tail of Striped Chipmunk.    \"It's a beautiful day; do come and play with us,\" cried the Merry  Little Breeze.    But Striped Chipmunk flirted his tail over his back once more.    \"Busy! busy! busy!\" he shouted over his shoulder and ran faster than  ever.    In a few minutes he was back again, but such a queer-looking fellow as  he was!  His head was twice as big as it had been before and you would  hardly have known that it was Striped Chipmunk but for the saucy way he  twitched his funny little tail and the spry way he scampered along the  old stone wall.    \"Oh, Striped Chipmunk's got the mumps!\" shouted the Merry Little  Breezes.    But Striped Chipmunk said never a word.  He couldn't.  He ran faster  than ever until he disappeared under the big stone.  When he popped his  head out again he was just his usual saucy little self.    \"Say, Striped Chipmunk,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, rushing over  to him, \"tell us how you happen to have pockets in your cheeks.\"    But Striped Chipmunk just snapped his bright eyes at them and said  \"Busy! busy! busy!\" as he scuttled over to the hollow chestnut tree.    The Merry Little Breezes saw that it was no use at all to try to tempt  Striped Chipmunk to play with them or to answer questions.    \"I tell you what,\" cried one, \"let's go ask Great-Grandfather Frog how  Striped Chipmunk happens to have pockets in his cheeks.  He'll know.\"    So away they started, after they had raced over to the big hollow  chestnut tree and sent a shower of brown nuts rattling down to Striped  Chipmunk from the burrs that Jack Frost had opened the night before.    \"Good-bye, Striped Chipmunk,\" they shouted as they romped across the  Green Meadows.  And Striped Chipmunk stopped long enough to shout  \"Good-bye\" before he filled his pockets with the brown nuts.    Old Grandfather Frog sat on his big green lily pad blinking in the sun.  It was very still, very, very still indeed.  Suddenly out of the brown  bulrushes burst the Merry Little Breezes and surrounded old Grandfather  Frog.  And every one of them had brought to him a fat, foolish, green  fly.    Grandfather's big goggly eyes sparkled and he gave a funny little hop  up into the air as he caught each foolish green fly.  When the last one  was safely inside his white and yellow waistcoat he settled himself  comfortably on the big green lily pad and folded his hands over the  foolish green flies.    \"Chug-a-rum!\"  said  Grandfather Frog.  \"What is it you want this  morning?\"    \"Oh, Grandfather Frog,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, \"tell us how it  happens that Striped Chipmunk has pockets in his cheeks.  Do tell us,  Grandfather Frog.  Please do!\"    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"How should I know?\"    \"But you do know, Grandfather Frog, you know you do.  Please tell us!\"  cried the Merry Little Breezes as they settled themselves among the  rushes.    And presently Grandfather Frog began:    \"Once upon a time--a long, long while ago--\"    \"When the world was young?\" asked a mischievous little Breeze.    Grandfather Frog pretended to be very much put out by the interruption,  and tried to look very severe.  But the Merry Little Breezes were all  giggling, so that presently he had to smile too.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"it was when the world was young, before old  King Bear became king.  Mr. Chipmunk, Striped Chipmunk's  great-great-great-grandfather a thousand times removed, was the  smallest of the squirrels, just as Striped Chipmunk is now.  But he  didn't mind that, not the least little bit.  Mr. Gray Squirrel was four  times as big and had a handsome tail, Mr. Fox Squirrel was four times  as big and he also had a handsome tail, Mr. Red Squirrel was twice as  big and he thought his tail was very good to see.  But Mr. Chipmunk  didn't envy his big cousins their fine tails; not he!  You see he had  himself a beautiful striped coat of which he was very proud and which  he thought much more to be desired than a big tail.    \"So Mr. Chipmunk went his way happy and contented and he was such a  merry little fellow and so full of fun and cut such funny capers that  everybody loved Mr. Chipmunk.    \"One day, when the nights were cool and all the trees had put on their  brilliant colors, old Mother Nature sent word down across the Green  Meadows that every squirrel should gather for her and store away until  she came a thousand nuts.  Now the squirrels had grown fat and lazy  through the long summer, all but Mr. Chipmunk, who frisked about so  much that he had no chance to grow fat.    \"Mr. Gray Squirrel grumbled.  Mr. Fox Squirrel grumbled.  Mr. Red  Squirrel grumbled.  But they didn't dare disobey old Mother Nature, so  they all set out, each to gather a thousand nuts.  And Mr. Chipmunk  alone was pleasant and cheerful.    \"When they reached the nut trees, what do you suppose they discovered?  Why, that they had been so greedy that they had eaten most of the nuts  and it was going to be hard work to find and store a thousand nuts for  old Mother Nature.  Then they began to hurry, did Mr. Gray Squirrel and  Mr. Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel, each trying to make sure of his  thousand nuts.  They quarreled and they fought over the nuts on the  ground and even up in the trees.  And because they were so big and so  strong, they pushed Mr. Chipmunk this way and they pushed him that way  and often just as he was going to pick up a fat nut one of them would  knock him over and make off with the prize.    \"Poor Mr. Chipmunk kept his temper and was as polite as ever, but how  he did work!  His cousins are great climbers and could get the nuts  still left on the trees, but Mr. Chipmunk is a poor climber, so he had  to be content with those on the ground.  Of course he could carry only  one nut at a time and his legs were so short that he had to run as fast  as ever he could to store each nut in his secret store-house and get  back for another.  And while the others quarreled and fought, he  hurried back and forth, back and forth, from early morning until jolly,  round, red Mr. Sun pulled his night cap on behind the Purple Hills,  hunting for nuts and putting them away in his secret store-house.    \"But the nuts grew scarcer and scarcer on the ground and harder to  find, for the other squirrels were picking them up too, and then they  did not have so far to carry them.    \"Sometimes one of his cousins up in the trees would drop a nut, but Mr.  Chipmunk never would take it, not even when he was having hard work to  find any, 'for,' said he to himself, 'if my cousin drops a nut, it is  his nut just the same.'    \"Finally Mr. Gray Squirrel announced that he had got his thousand nuts.  Then Mr. Fox Squirrel announced that he had got his thousand nuts.  The  next day Mr. Red Squirrel stopped hunting because he had his thousand  nuts.    \"But Mr. Chipmunk had hardly more than half as many.  And that night he  made a dreadful discovery--some one had found his secret store-house  and had _stolen_ some of his precious nuts.    \"'It's of no use to cry over what can't be helped,' said Mr. Chipmunk,  and the next morning he bravely started out again.  He had worked so  hard that he had grown thinner and thinner until now he was only a  shadow of his old self.  But he was as cheerful as ever and kept right  on hunting and hunting for stray nuts.  Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr. Fox  Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel sat around and rested and made fun of  him.  Way up in the tops of the tallest trees a few nuts still clung,  but his cousins did not once offer to go up and shake them down for Mr.  Chipmunk.    \"And then old Mother Nature came down across the Green Meadows.  First  Mr. Gray Squirrel took her to his storehouse and she counted his  thousand nuts.  Then Mr. Fox Squirrel led her to his storehouse and she  counted his thousand nuts.  Then Mr. Red Squirrel showed her his  store-house and she counted his thousand nuts.    \"Last of all Mr. Chipmunk led her to his secret store-house and showed  her the pile of nuts he had worked so hard to get.  Old Mother Nature  didn't need to count them to see that there were not a thousand there.    \"'I've done the best I could,' said Mr. Chipmunk bravely, and he  trembled all over, he was so tired.    \"Old Mother Nature said never a word but went out on the Green Meadows  and sent the Merry Little Breezes to call together all the little  meadow people and all the little forest folks.  When they had all  gathered before her she suddenly turned to Mr. Gray Squirrel.    \"'Go bring me a hundred nuts from your store-house,' said she.    \"Then she turned to Mr. Fox Squirrel.    \"'Go bring me a hundred nuts from your store-house,' said she.    \"Last of all she called Mr. Red Squirrel out where all could see him.  Mr. Red Squirrel crept out very slowly.  His teeth chattered and his  tail, of which he was so proud, dragged on the ground, for you see Mr.  Red Squirrel had something on his mind.    \"Then old Mother Nature told how she had ordered each squirrel to get  and store for her a thousand nuts.  She told just how selfish Mr. Gray  Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel had been.  She told just how hard Mr.  Chipmunk had worked and then she told how part of his precious store  had been stolen.    \"'And there,' said old Mother Nature in a loud voice so that every one  should hear, 'there is the thief!'    \"Then she commanded Mr. Red Squirrel to go to his store-house and bring  her half of the biggest and best nuts he had there!    \"Mr. Red Squirrel sneaked off with his head hanging, and began to bring  the nuts.  And as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#6)"],[1,"one could make a living.    Merchants fared like the artisans. They, too, could buy the right of  residence outside the Pale, permanent or temporary, on conditions that  gave them no real security. I was proud to have an uncle who was a  merchant of the First Guild, but it was very expensive for my uncle.  He had to pay so much a year for the title, and a certain percentage  on the profits from his business. This gave him the right to travel on  business outside the Pale, twice a year, for not more than six months  in all. If he were found outside the Pale after his permit expired, he  had to pay a fine that exceeded all he had gained by his journey,  perhaps. I used to picture my uncle on his Russian travels, hurrying,  hurrying to finish his business in the limited time; while a policeman  marched behind him, ticking off the days and counting up the hours.  That was a foolish fancy, but some of the things that were done in  Russia really were very funny.    There were things in Polotzk that made you laugh with one eye and weep  with the other, like a clown. During an epidemic of cholera, the city  officials, suddenly becoming energetic, opened stations for the  distribution of disinfectants to the people. A quarter of the  population was dead when they began, and most of the dead were buried,  while some lay decaying in deserted houses. The survivors, some of  them crazy from horror, stole through the empty streets, avoiding one  another, till they came to the appointed stations, where they pushed  and crowded to get their little bottles of carbolic acid. Many died  from fear in those horrible days, but some must have died from  laughter. For only the Gentiles were allowed to receive the  disinfectant. Poor Jews who had nothing but their new-made graves were  driven away from the stations.    Perhaps it was wrong of us to think of our Gentile neighbors as a  different species of beings from ourselves, but such madness as that  did not help to make them more human in our eyes. It was easier to be  friends with the beasts in the barn than with some of the Gentiles.  The cow and the goat and the cat responded to kindness, and  remembered which of the housemaids was generous and which was cross.  The Gentiles made no distinctions. A Jew was a Jew, to be hated and  spat upon and used spitefully.    The only Gentiles, besides the few of the intelligent kind, who did  not habitually look upon us with hate and contempt, were the stupid  peasants from the country, who were hardly human themselves. They  lived in filthy huts together with their swine, and all they cared for  was how to get something to eat. It was not their fault. The land laws  made them so poor that they had to sell themselves to fill their  bellies. What help was there for us in the good will of such wretched  slaves? For a cask of vodka you could buy up a whole village of them.  They trembled before the meanest townsman, and at a sign from a  long-haired priest they would sharpen their axes against us.    The Gentiles had their excuse for their malice. They said our  merchants and money-lenders preyed upon them, and our shopkeepers gave  false measure. People who want to defend the Jews ought never to deny  this. Yes, I say, we cheated the Gentiles whenever we dared, because  it was the only thing to do. Remember how the Czar was always sending  us commands,--you shall not do this and you shall not do that, until  there was little left that we might honestly do, except pay tribute  and die. There he had us cooped up, thousands of us where only  hundreds could live, and every means of living taxed to the utmost.  When there are too many wolves in the prairie, they begin to prey upon  each other. We starving captives of the Pale--we did as do the hungry  brutes. But our humanity showed in our discrimination between our  victims. Whenever we could, we spared our own kind, directing against  our racial foes the cunning wiles which our bitter need invented. Is  not that the code of war? Encamped in the midst of the enemy, we could  practice no other. A Jew could hardly exist in business unless he  developed a dual conscience, which allowed him to do to the Gentile  what he would call a sin against a fellow Jew. Such spiritual  deformities are self-explained in the step-children of the Czar. A  glance over the statutes of the Pale leaves you wondering that the  Russian Jews have not lost all semblance to humanity.       [Illustration: THE GRAVE DIGGER OF POLOTZK]    A favorite complaint against us was that we were greedy for gold. Why  could not the Gentiles see the whole truth where they saw half? Greedy  for profits we were, eager for bargains, for savings, intent on  squeezing the utmost out of every business transaction. But why? Did  not the Gentiles know the reason? Did they not know what price we had  to pay for the air we breathed? If a Jew and a Gentile kept store side  by side, the Gentile could content himself with smaller profits. He  did not have to buy permission to travel in the interests of his  business. He did not have to pay three hundred rubles fine if his son  evaded military service. He was saved the expense of hushing inciters  of pogroms. Police favor was retailed at a lower price to him than to  the Jew. His nature did not compel him to support schools and  charities. It cost nothing to be a Christian; on the contrary, it  brought rewards and immunities. To be a Jew was a costly luxury, the  price of which was either money or blood. Is it any wonder that we  hoarded our pennies? What his shield is to the soldier in battle, that  was the ruble to the Jew in the Pale.    The knowledge of such things as I am telling leaves marks upon the  flesh and spirit. I remember little children in Polotzk with old, old  faces and eyes glazed with secrets. I knew how to dodge and cringe and  dissemble before I knew the names of the seasons. And I had plenty of  time to ponder on these things, because I was so idle. If they had let  me go to school, now--But of course they didn't.    There was no free school for girls, and even if your parents were rich  enough to send you to a private school, you could not go very far. At  the high school, which was under government control, Jewish children  were admitted in limited numbers,--only ten to every hundred,--and  even if you were among the lucky ones, you had your troubles. The  tutor who prepared you talked all the time about the examinations you  would have to pass, till you were scared. You heard on all sides that  the brightest Jewish children were turned down if the examining  officers did not like the turn of their noses. You went up to be  examined with the other Jewish children, your heart heavy about that  matter of your nose. There was a special examination for the Jewish  candidates, of course; a nine-year-old Jewish child had to answer  questions that a thirteen-year-old Gentile was hardly expected to  understand. But that did not matter so much. You had been prepared for  the thirteen-year-old test; you found the questions quite easy. You  wrote your answers triumphantly--and you received a low rating, and  there was no appeal.    I used to stand in the doorway of my father's store, munching an apple  that did not taste good any more, and watch the pupils going home from  school in twos and threes; the girls in neat brown dresses and black  aprons and little stiff hats, the boys in trim uniforms with many  buttons. They had ever so many books in the satchels on their backs.  They would take them out at home, and read and write, and learn all  sorts of interesting things. They looked to me like beings from  another world than mine. But those whom I envied had their own  troubles, as I often heard. Their school life was one struggle against  injustice from instructors, spiteful treatment from fellow students,  and insults from everybody. Those who, by heroic efforts and  transcendent good luck, successfully finished the course, found  themselves against a new wall, if they wished to go on. They were  turned down at the universities, which admitted them in the ratio of  three Jews to a hundred Gentiles, under the same debarring entrance  conditions as at the high school,--especially rigorous examinations,  dishonest marking, or arbitrary rulings without disguise. No, the Czar  did not want us in the schools.    I heard from my mother of a different state of affairs, at the time  when her brothers were little boys. The Czar of those days had a  bright idea. He said to his ministers: \"Let us educate the people. Let  us win over those Jews through the public schools, instead of allowing  them to persist in their narrow Hebrew learning, which teaches them no  love for their monarch. Force has failed with them; the unwilling  converts return to their old ways whenever they dare. Let us try  education.\"    Perhaps peaceable conversion of the Jews was not the Czar's only  motive when he opened public schools everywhere and compelled parents  to send their boys for instruction. Perhaps he just wanted to be good,  and really hoped to benefit the country. But to the Jews the public  schools appeared as a trap door to the abyss of apostasy. The  instructors were always Christians, the teaching was Christian, and  the regulations of the schoolroom, as to hours, costume, and manners,  were often in opposition to Jewish practices. The public school  interrupted the boy's sacred studies in the Hebrew school. Where would  you look for pious Jews, after a few generations of boys brought up by  Christian teachers? Plainly the Czar was after the souls of the Jewish  children. The church door gaped for them at the end of the school  course. And all good Jews rose up against the schools, and by every  means, fair or foul, kept their boys away. The official appointed to  keep the register of boys for school purposes waxed rich on the bribes  paid him by anxious parents who kept their sons in hiding."]]]
