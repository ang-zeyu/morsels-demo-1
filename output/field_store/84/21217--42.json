She was like one walking in her sleep, but  when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and  struggled.  They pushed her into the carriage.  She fought her way out  again.  I took her part, got her into a cab, and here we are.  I shan't  forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away. I'd have a  short life if he had his way--the black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.\"    We carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa, and a couple of cups of  the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug.  Baynes had been summoned by Holmes, and the situation rapidly explained  to him.    \"Why, sir, you've got me the very evidence I want,\" said the inspector  warmly, shaking my friend by the hand.  \"I was on the same scent as you  from the first.\"    \"What!  You were after Henderson?\"    \"Why, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable  I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below.  It  was just who would get his evidence first.\"    \"Then why did you arrest the mulatto?\"    Baynes chuckled.    \"I was sure Henderson, as he calls himself, felt that he was suspected,  and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was  in any danger.  I arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our  eyes were off him.  I knew he would be likely to clear off then and  give us a chance of getting at Miss Burnet.\"    Holmes laid his hand upon the inspector's shoulder.    \"You will rise high in your profession.  You have instinct and  intuition,\" said he.    Baynes flushed with pleasure.    \"I've had a plain-clothes man waiting at the station all the week.  Wherever the High Gable folk go he will keep them in sight.  But he  must have been hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away.  However,  your man picked her up, and it all ends well.  We can't arrest without  her evidence, that is clear, so the sooner we get a statement the  better.\"    \"Every minute she gets stronger,\" said Holmes, glancing at the  governess.  \"But tell me, Baynes, who is this man Henderson?\"    \"Henderson,\" the inspector answered, \"is Don Murillo, once called the  Tiger of San Pedro.\"    The Tiger of San Pedro!  The whole history of the man came back to me  in a flash.  He had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty  tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to  civilization.  Strong, fearless, and energetic, he had sufficient  virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people  for ten or twelve years.  His name was a terror through all Central  America.  At the end of that time there was a universal rising against  him.  But he was as cunning as he was cruel, and at the first whisper  of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship  which was manned by devoted adherents.  It was an empty palace which  was stormed by the insurgents next day.  The dictator, his two  children, his secretary, and his wealth had all escaped them. From that  moment he had vanished from the world, and his identity had been a  frequent subject for comment in the European press.    \"Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,\" said Baynes. \"If you  look it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and  white, same as in the note, Mr. Holmes.  Henderson he called himself,  but I traced him back, Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona, where  his ship came in in '86.  They've been looking for him all the time for  their revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find him out.\"    \"They discovered him a year ago,\" said Miss Burnet, who had sat up and  was now intently following the conversation.  \"Once already his life  has been attempted, but some evil spirit shielded him.  Now, again, it  is the noble, chivalrous Garcia who has fallen, while the monster goes  safe.  But another will come, and yet another, until some day justice  will be done; that is as certain as the rise of to-morrow's sun.\"  Her  thin hands clenched, and her worn face blanched with the passion of her  hatred.    \"But how come you into this matter, Miss Burnet?\" asked Holmes. \"How  can an English lady join in such a murderous affair?\"    \"I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which  justice can be gained.  What does the law of England care for the  rivers of blood shed years ago in San Pedro, or for the shipload of  treasure which this man has stolen?  To you they are like crimes  committed in some other planet.  But _we_ know.  We have learned the  truth in sorrow and in suffering.  To us there is no fiend in hell like  Juan Murillo, and no peace in life while his victims still cry for  vengeance.\"    \"No doubt,\" said Holmes, \"he was as you say. I have heard that he was  atrocious.  But how are you affected?\"    \"I will tell you it all. This villain's policy was to murder, on one  pretext or another, every man who showed such promise that he might in  time come to be a dangerous rival.  My husband--yes, my real name is  Signora Victor Durando--was the San Pedro minister in London.  He met  me and married me there.  A nobler man never lived upon earth.  Unhappily, Murillo heard of his excellence, recalled him on some  pretext, and had him shot.  With a premonition of his fate he had  refused to take me with him.  His estates were confiscated, and I was  left with a pittance and a broken heart.    \"Then came the downfall of the tyrant.  He escaped as you have just  described.  But the many whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest and  dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands, would not let the  matter rest.  They banded themselves into a society which should never  be dissolved until the work was done. It was my part after we had  discovered in the transformed Henderson the fallen despot, to attach  myself to his household and keep the others in touch with his  movements.  This I was able to do by securing the position of governess  in his family.  He little knew that the woman who faced him at every  meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hour's notice  into eternity.  I smiled on him, did my duty to his children, and bided  my time.  An attempt was made in Paris and failed.  We zig-zagged  swiftly here and there over Europe to throw off the pursuers and  finally returned to this house, which he had taken upon his first  arrival in England.    \"But here also the ministers of justice were waiting.  Knowing that he  would return there, Garcia, who is the son of the former highest  dignitary in San Pedro, was waiting with two trusty companions of  humble station, all three fired with the same reasons for revenge. He  could do little during the day, for Murillo took every precaution and  never went out save with his satellite Lucas, or Lopez as he was known  in the days of his greatness.  At night, however, he slept alone, and  the avenger might find him.  On a certain evening, which had been  prearranged, I sent my friend final instructions, for the man was  forever on the alert and continually changed his room.  I was to see  that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a  window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if  the attempt had better be postponed.    \"But everything went wrong with us.  In some way I had excited the  suspicion of Lopez, the secretary.  He crept up behind me and sprang  upon me just as I had finished the note.  He and his master dragged me  to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress.  Then  and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they have  seen how to escape the consequences of the deed.  Finally, after much  debate, they concluded that my murder was too dangerous.  But they  determined to get rid forever of Garcia.  They had gagged me, and  Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address.  I swear  that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean  to Garcia.  Lopez addressed the note which I had written, sealed it  with his sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, Jose.  How they murdered him I do not know, save that it was Murillo's hand  who struck him down, for Lopez had remained to guard me.  I believe he  must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds  and struck him down as he passed. At first they were of a mind to let  him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar; but they  argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity  would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further  attacks. With the death of Garcia, the pursuit might cease, since such  a death might frighten others from the task.    \"All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge  of what they had done.  I have no doubt that there were times when my  life hung in the balance.  I was confined to my room, terrorized by the  most horrible threats, cruelly ill-used to break my spirit--see this  stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms--and a  gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call  from the window.  For five days this cruel imprisonment continued, with  hardly enough food to hold body and soul together.  This afternoon a  good lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I  had been drugged.  In a sort of dream I remember being half-led,  half-carried to the carriage; in the same state I was conveyed to the  train.  Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did I suddenly  realize that my liberty lay in my own hands.  I sprang out, they tried  to drag me back, and had it not been for the help of this good man, who  led me to the cab, I should never had broken away.  Now, thank God, I  am beyond their power forever.\"    We had all listened intently to this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23434"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Insects (#6)"],[1," of large green flies  which bask in the March sun on the south sides of buildings. They are  not with us long, however, until we notice flashes of white quickly  moving about from one early weed to another. These are the advance  guards of the cabbage millers or butterflies. All through the cold  winter they remained in the chrysalis stage stuck to the sides of  houses, fence posts and in other protected places, awaiting the first  breath of spring. The first adults to emerge find no cabbage on which  to lay their eggs so they are compelled to use other plants such as  pepper grass.    [Illustration: Egg of cabbage miller much enlarged.]    The eggs are very small and are usually placed on the lower edge of the  leaf. These hatch and the small green worms appear. Throughout the  summer there are a number of broods produced and an enormous amount of  damage is done. Just before frost the last caterpillars search for  protected places where they pass to the pupal or resting stage for the  winter. No cocoon is spun by this caterpillar.    Where measures are not taken to control the cabbage worms they destroy  much of the cabbage crop each season. The white butterflies can be seen  any day during the summer visiting cabbage, mustard, radishes and other  similar plants. By destroying all of the worms and millers in the early  spring one has less trouble later. This can be done by hand picking, or  where the patch is large by spraying with a poison solution to which  soap is added to keep the solution from rolling off in large drops.  Poison can be used until the heads are well formed, but if the first  worms in the spring are destroyed, later spraying is unnecessary though  an occasional handpicking will help.      OBSERVATIONS AND STUDY    [Illustration: Cabbage worm feeding, slightly enlarged.]    Go into the garden and examine the cabbage for small green worms which  vary from one fourth to a little over an inch in length. What is the  nature of their work on the leaf? Where do they feed most, on the outer  or inner leaves? Do they eat the entire leaf? How does the work of the  young worms differ from that of the larger ones? Do they spin silk? Are  they on the top or under side of the leaf? Examine under the dead and  dried leaves at the ground and see if you can find small, hard, gray  objects which have sharp angles and which are tied to the leaf with a  cord of silk. What are these objects? Watch the miller as she visits the  cabbage and see if you can find the small eggs which she lays on the  under side of the leaves. When she visits a cabbage plant she bends her  body up under the outer leaves and stops but a moment, fluttering all  the while as she sticks the small egg to the leaf. It is about the size  of a small crumb of bread. What does the miller feed on? Does she visit  flowers? If so, what flowers?    [Illustration: Pupa or chrysalis of cabbage miller.]      BREEDING WORK    Collect a few of the worms and put them in a glass jar with a piece of  cabbage leaf. Examine them carefully and watch them crawl. How many legs  do they have? Where are they placed on the body? How can they use so  many legs while crawling? How many joints are there to the body? Note  the short fine hair all over the body which gives it the appearance of  green velvet. What color is the head? How does the caterpillar feed?  Write a brief description of the worm. Do not mistake it for the cabbage  span-worm which is also green, but which walks by humping up its back.    [Illustration: Cabbage miller on red clover blossom.]    Keep the cabbage worms in the jar for a few days and watch them  disappear. After they have disappeared, what is left in the jar? These  are the chrysalids or pupae of the insect and later from them will come  the millers. Take one of the pupae in your hand and see if it can move.  If it is in the summer the miller will appear in a week, but if it is in  the late fall it will simply pass the winter in the pupa stage. Watch  the miller escape from the pupal case and describe it. Examine the  miller carefully and describe briefly the number of legs, wings,  segments of body, sucking tube and color markings. Make careful drawings  of the caterpillar, chrysalis and butterfly. What gives the color to the  wings? Rub the wings between your fingers and see if the color comes  off. The wings are covered with very small scales of different colors  which combine to give the beautiful markings. The wings of all  butterflies and moths are covered with scales and hairs in this way. In  this insect we find both chewing and sucking mouth parts. The  caterpillar chews while the parent butterfly has a long tube for sucking  up nectar from flowers and water from puddles in the road.           *       *       *       *       *        \"_Far out at sea--the sun was high,        While veered the wind and flapped the sail;      We saw a snow-white butterfly        Dancing before the fitful gale            Far out at sea._        \"_The little wanderer, who had lost        His way, of danger nothing knew;      Settled a while upon the mast;        Then fluttered o'er the waters blue            Far out at sea._        \"_Above, there gleamed the boundless sky;        Beneath, the boundless ocean sheen;      Between them danced the butterfly,        The spirit-life of this vast scene,            Far out at sea._        \"_The tiny soul that soared away,        Seeking the clouds on fragile wings,      Lured by the brighter, purer ray        Which hope's ecstatic morning brings--            Far out at sea._        \"_Away he sped, with shimmering glee,        Scarce seen, now lost, yet onward borne!

H. HORNE.          CHAPTER VII    THE APPLE WORM      [Illustration: Apple worms in core of apple. Usually only one worm  appears in an apple. Note the decaying of the apple.]    This is perhaps the most destructive insect pest attacking the apple.  Every year, that we have a good apple crop, there are thousands of  bushels of wormy apples which are practically worthless. This means an  actual loss of thousands of dollars a year to the apple growers of this  country. For this reason alone each child should come to know the life  history, habits and injury of this pest. It is most destructive to the  apple though the pear comes in for its share.    [Illustration: The codling moth slightly enlarged. (From Slingerland).]    Every country child and many of those of the cities, are familiar with  this worm for they often bite into it while eating apples. The small  worms crawl down in the blossom end of the young developing apple and  from there bore into the pulp and eventually reach the core of the  fruit. They stay in the apple about six weeks when they eat a hole out  to the surface and crawl down to the trunk where loose bark offers a  hiding place. Here they spin their cocoons and change to a small,  brown, plump pupa and after a few days the winged moth emerges. The moth  is very small and is not often found by one not acquainted with it. They  come out during late June and early July when they lay eggs for a second  colony of worms which again enter the fruit and destroy more of it.  These worms of the second brood are usually mature and leave the fruit  about the time apples are picked in the fall in central Missouri. They  escape and soon spin cocoons in which they pass the winter. Early in the  spring these change to pupae and later the moths come out. They appear  about the time apples bloom in the spring and lay the eggs for the first  worms which enter in great numbers at the blossom end.    This in short, is the life story of the pest through the year. Little  can be done to destroy the pest after it gets into the fruit, therefore  remedies must be applied to destroy the worm before it gets into the  fruit. All orchards should be sprayed with a poison in the spring  before the worms appear. Since most of them enter by way of the blossom  end, it is necessary that the poison be put into the blossom end. To do  this spray at once after the blossoms fall, repeat after two weeks and  spray again in July to kill the second brood of worms. The protection of  woodpeckers and sapsuckers will also help as they feed on the worms  under the bark.    [Illustration: Apple blossoms at about the right stage for receiving the  first and most important arsenical spray for the control of the apple  worm.]      OBSERVATIONS AND BREEDING WORK    Go into the orchard and examine for apples with masses of sawdust-like  material projecting from the sides or blossom end. By removing this  brown deposit which is the excrement of the worm, you will find a hole  leading into the apple. Cut open one of these and determine the course  of the tunnel. Where do you find the worm? Do all such apples contain  worms? Where have they gone? How does the feeding of the worms injure  the fruit? Do any of the wormy apples show rot? Are any of the windfalls  in the orchard wormy and if so what proportion?    Remove a worm from one of the apples and examine it. How many legs has  it? What color is it and does it have hair upon its body? Can it crawl  fast? Does it spin silk? Put a number of the large worms in a jar and  examine from day to day and keep records of what happens. Collect a  number in the fall and keep them in a box outdoors during the winter. In  the spring watch them change to the pupa in the cocoon and a little  later the mature insect or codling moth, as it is commonly called, will  emerge. Describe the moth and pin a number of them for your collection.  What time in the spring do the caterpillars"]]]
