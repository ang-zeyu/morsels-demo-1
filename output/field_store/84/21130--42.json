[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/216"],[0,"The Tao Teh King, or the Tao and its Characteristics (#6)"],[1,"streams, is their skill in being lower  than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all.  So it is  that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his  words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person  behind them.    2. In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his  weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an  injury to them.    3. Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of  him.  Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive  with him.      67. 1. All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears  to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).   Now it is just its  greatness that makes it seem to be inferior.  If it were like any  other (system), for long would its smallness have been known!    2. But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast.  The  first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking  from taking precedence of others.    3. With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be  liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a  vessel of the highest honour.  Now-a-days they give up gentleness and  are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the  hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end  is) death.    4. Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to  maintain its ground.  Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very)  gentleness protecting him.      68.        He who in (Tao's) wars has skill        Assumes no martial port;      He who fights with most good will        To rage makes no resort.      He who vanquishes yet still        Keeps from his foes apart;      He whose hests men most fulfil        Yet humbly plies his art.        Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends,        And therein is his might.'      Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends,        That they with him unite.'      Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends,        No sage of old more bright.'      69. 1. A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the  host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the  defensive).  I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a  foot.'  This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks;  baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping  the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the  enemy where there is no enemy.    2. There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war.  To do  that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious.  Thus it is  that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores  (the situation) conquers.      70. 1. My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but  there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise  them.    2. There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my  words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce).  It  is because they do not know these, that men do not know me.    3. They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be  prized.  It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth,  while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom.      71. 1. To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest  (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease.    2. It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this  disease that we are preserved from it.  The sage has not the disease.  He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he  does not have it.      72. 1. When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which  is their great dread will come on them.    2. Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary  life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on.    3. It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not  arise.    4. Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not  parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value  on, himself.  And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes  choice of the former.      73. 1. He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in  defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in  his not daring (to do so) lives on.  Of these two cases the one  appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious.  But       When Heaven's anger smites a man,     Who the cause shall truly scan?    On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the  former case).    2. It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully  overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in obtaining a reply;  does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves.  Its  demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective.  The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting  nothing escape.      74. 1. The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to)  frighten them with death?  If the people were always in awe of death,  and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death,  who would dare to do wrong?    2. There is always One who presides over the infliction of death.  He who  would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be  described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter.  Seldom is it  that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter,  does not cut his own hands!      75. 1. The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes  consumed by their superiors.  It is through this that they suffer  famine.    2. The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive)  agency of their superiors (in governing them).  It is through this  that they are difficult to govern.    3. The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their  labours in seeking for the means of living.  It is this which makes  them think light of dying.  Thus it is that to leave the subject of  living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on  it.      76. 1. Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and  strong.  (So it is with) all things.  Trees and plants, in their early  growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered.    2. Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of  death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life.    3. Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not  conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms,  (and thereby invites the feller.)    4. Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that  of what is soft and weak is above.      77. 1. May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method  of) bending a bow?  The (part of the bow) which was high is brought  low, and what was low is raised up.  (So Heaven) diminishes where  there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency.    2. It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to  supplement deficiency.  It is not so with the way of man.  He takes  away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.    3. Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under  heaven?  Only he who is in possession of the Tao!    4. Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as  his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he  does not wish to display his superiority.      78. 1. There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water,  and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing  that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual)  for which it can be changed.    2. Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and  the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.    3.       Therefore a sage has said,    'He who accepts his state's reproach,       Is hailed therefore its altars' lord;     To him who bears men's direful woes       They all the name of King accord.'    4. Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.      79. 1. When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a  great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind  of the one who was wrong).  And how can this be beneficial (to the  other)?    2. Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand  portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the  (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party.  (So), he who has the  attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the  engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the  conditions favourable to himself.    3. In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always  on the side of the good man.      80. 1. In a little state with a small population, I would so order it,  that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a  hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the  people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove  elsewhere (to avoid it).    2. Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion  to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they  should have no occasion to don or use them.    3. I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead  of the written characters).    4. They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes  beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common  (simple) ways sources of enjoyment.    5. There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices  of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I  would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any  intercourse with it.      81. 1.

For my own part, I have had an hospital these fourteen years  within myself, and studied my own case with the most painful attention;  consequently may be supposed to know something of the matter, although  I have not taken regular courses of physiology et cetera et cetera.--  In short, I have for some time been of opinion (no offence, dear Doctor)  that the sum of all your medical discoveries amounts to this, that the  more you study the less you know.--I have read all that has been written  on the Hot Wells, and what I can collect from the whole, is, that the  water contains nothing but a little salt, and calcarious earth, mixed in  such inconsiderable proportion, as can have very little, if any, effect  on the animal economy. This being the case, I think the man deserves to  be fitted with a cap and bells, who for such a paultry advantage as this  spring affords, sacrifices his precious time, which might be employed  in taking more effectual remedies, and exposes himself to the dirt, the  stench, the chilling blasts, and perpetual rains, that render this place  to me intolerable. If these waters, from a small degree of astringency,  are of some service in the diabetes, diarrhoea, and night sweats, when  the secretions are too much increased, must not they do harm in the same  proportion, where the humours are obstructed, as in the asthma,  scurvy, gout and dropsy?--Now we talk of the dropsy, here is a strange  fantastical oddity, one of your brethren, who harangues every day in  the Pump-room, as if he was hired to give lectures on all subjects  whatsoever--I know not what to make of him--Sometimes he makes  shrewd remarks; at other times he talks like the greatest simpleton in  nature--He has read a great deal; but without method or judgment, and  digested nothing. He believes every thing he has read; especially if  it has any thing of the marvellous in it and his conversation is a  surprizing hotch-potch of erudition and extravagance. He told me t'other  day, with great confidence, that my case was dropsical; or, as he called  it, leucophlegmatic: A sure sign, that his want of experience is equal  to his presumption--for, you know, there is nothing analogous to the  dropsy in my disorder--I wish those impertinent fellows, with their  ricketty understandings, would keep their advice for those that ask it.  Dropsy, indeed! Sure I have not lived to the age of fifty-five, and had  such experience of my own disorder, and consulted you and other eminent  physicians, so often, and so long, to be undeceived by such a--But,  without all doubt, the man is mad; and, therefore, what he says is of  no consequence. I had, yesterday, a visit from Higgins, who came hither  under the terror of your threats, and brought me in a present a brace of  hares, which he owned he took in my ground; and I could not persuade  the fellow that he did wrong, or that I would ever prosecute him for  poaching--I must desire you will wink hard at the practices of this  rascallion, otherwise I shall be plagued with his presents, which cost  me more than they are worth.--If I could wonder at any thing Fitzowen  does, I should be surprized at his assurance in desiring you to solicit  my vote for him at the next election for the county: for him, who  opposed me, on the like occasion, with the most illiberal competition.  You may tell him civilly, that I beg to be excused. Direct your next for  me at Bath, whither I propose to remove to-morrow; not only on my own  account, but for the sake of my niece, Liddy, who is like to relapse.  The poor creature fell into a fit yesterday, while I was cheapening a  pair of spectacles, with a Jew-pedlar. I am afraid there is something  still lurking in that little heart of hers, which I hope a change of  objects will remove. Let me know what you think of this half-witted  Doctor's impertinent, ridiculous, and absurd notion of my disorder--So  far from being dropsical, I am as lank in the belly as a grey-hound;  and, by measuring my ancle with a pack-thread, I find the swelling  subsides every day. From such doctors, good Lord deliver us!--I have not  yet taken any lodgings in Bath; because there we can be accommodated at  a minute's warning, and I shall choose for myself--I need not say your  directions for drinking and bathing will be agreeable to,    Dear Lewis, Yours ever, MAT. BRAMBLE    P.S. I forgot to tell you, that my right ancle pits, a symptom, as I  take it, of its being oedematous, not leucophlegmatic.          To Miss LETTY WILLIS, at Gloucester    HOT WELL, April 21.    MY DEAR LETTY,    I did not intend to trouble you again, till we should be settled at  Bath; but having the occasion of Jarvis, I could not let it slip,  especially as I have something extraordinary to communicate. O, my dear  companion! What shall I tell you? for several days past there was a  Jew-looking man, that plied at the Wells with a box of spectacles; and  he always eyed me so earnestly, that I began to be very uneasy. At last,  he came to our lodgings at Clifton, and lingered about the door, as  if he wanted to speak to somebody--I was seized with an odd kind of  fluttering, and begged Win to throw herself in his way: but the poor  girl has weak nerves, and was afraid of his beard. My uncle, having  occasion for new glasses, called him up stairs, and was trying a pair  of spectacles, when the man, advancing to me, said in a whisper--O  gracious! what d'ye think he said?--'I am Wilson!' His features struck  me that very moment it was Wilson, sure enough! but so disguised, that  it would have been impossible to know him, if my heart had not assisted  in the discovery. I was so surprised, and so frightened that I fainted  away, but soon recovered; and found myself supported by him on the  chair, while my uncle was running about the room, with the spectacles  on his nose, calling for help. I had no opportunity to speak to him; but  looks were sufficiently expressive. He was payed for his glasses, and  went away. Then I told Win who he was, and sent her after him to the  Pump-room; where she spoke to him, and begged him in my name to withdraw  from the place, that he might not incur the suspicion of my uncle or my  brother, if he did not want to see me die of terror and vexation. The  poor youth declared, with tears in his eyes, that he had something  extraordinary to communicate; and asked, if she would deliver a letter  to me: but this she absolutely refused, by my order.--Finding her  obstinate in her refusal, he desired she would tell me that he was no  longer a player, but a gentleman; in which character he would very soon  avow his passion for me, without fear of censure or reproach--Nay,  he even discovered his name and family, which, to my great grief,  the simple girl forgot, in the confusion occasioned by her being seen  talking to him by my brother, who stopt her on the road, and asked  what business she had with that rascally Jew. She pretended she was  cheapening a stay-hook, but was thrown into such a quandary, that she  forgot the most material part of the information; and when she came  home, went into an hysteric fit of laughing. This transaction happened  three days ago, during which he has not appeared, so that I suppose he  has gone. Dear Letty! you see how Fortune takes pleasure in persecuting  your poor friend. If you should see him at Gloucester--or if you have  seen him, and know his real name and family, pray keep me no longer in  suspence--And yet, if he is under no obligation to keep himself longer  concealed, and has a real affection for me, I should hope he will, in a  little time, declare himself to my relations. Sure, if there is  nothing unsuitable in the match, they won't be so cruel as to thwart my  inclinations--O what happiness would then be my portion! I can't help  indulging the thought, and pleasing my fancy with such agreeable ideas;  which after all, perhaps, will never be realized--But, why should I  despair? who knows what will happen?--We set out for Bath to-morrow, and  I am almost sorry for it; as I begin to be in love with solitude, and  this is a charming romantic place. The air is so pure; the Downs are so  agreeable; the furz in full blossom; the ground enamelled with daisies,  and primroses, and cowslips; all the trees bursting into leaves, and the  hedges already clothed with their vernal livery; the mountains covered  with flocks of sheep and tender bleating wanton lambkins playing,  frisking, and skipping from side to side; the groves resound with  the notes of blackbird, thrush, and linnet; and all night long sweet  Philomel pours forth her ravishingly delightful song. Then, for  variety, we go down to the nymph of Bristol spring, where the company is  assembled before dinner; so good natured, so free, so easy; and there we  drink the water so clear, so pure, so mild, so charmingly maukish. There  the fun is so chearful and reviving; the weather so soft; the walk so  agreeable; the prospect so amusing; and the ships and boats going up and  down the river, close under the windows of the Pump-room, afford such an  enchanting variety of Moving Pictures, as require a much abler pen than  mine to describe. To make this place a perfect paradise to me, nothing  is wanting but an agreeable companion and sincere friend; such as  my dear miss Willis hath been, and I hope still will be, to her ever  faithful.    LYDIA MELFORD    Direct for me, still under cover, to Win; and Jarvis will take care to  convey it safe. Adieu.          To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.    BATH, April 24.    DEAR PHILLIPS,    You have, indeed, reason to be surprised, that I should have concealed  my correspondence with miss Blackerby from you, to whom I disclosed all  my other connexions of that nature; but the truth is, I never dreamed  of any such commerce, till your last informed me, that it had"]]]
