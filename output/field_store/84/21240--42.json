To some the latter life would be intolerable  while strength and human passion last; but these poor yet happy people,  being nearer to Nature, are often nearer also to Nature's God.    We now pass through groves of olive trees, whose sombre and silver  tinted foliage, and wonderfully gnarled and twisted trunks, give quite a  foreign tone to the landscape. Also the orange trees, with their green  and golden fruit and enchantingly fragrant white blossoms; and the  lordly palm, with its graceful outline clearly defined against the blue  sky.    It has frequently been a question with me which tree is the most useful  to man, especially in the east--the olive, bamboo, palm, or cocoa-nut.  The first carries my mind back to pleasant memories of the Holy Land and  Mount Olivet, where a single tree is said to bear fruit for more than a  thousand years. We know the fine and wholesome oil it yields. Its fruit  is used as food, and its beautifully grained wood is highly valued for  cabinet purposes. Then the bamboo, which, growing by the water-side, is  so refreshing to hear whispering in the breeze, is used for very many  purposes, being at once so light and strong; for carrying great burdens,  for aqueducts, house-building, musical instruments, and for numerous  other purposes and articles useful and ornamental; while the graceful  palm, or cocoa-nut, provides food, drink, clothing, and building  material. Each doubtless in its region and sphere is equally prized. But  the more we examine and understand the bountiful gifts of God for our  use and happiness, harmonizing so well with our needs, the greater  wonder we feel that there is such an ungrateful animal as an _Atheist_.    At some of the little railway stations we passed, the Gloire de Dijon  and other lovely roses were clustering the walls, and growing almost  wild in the hedges, loading the air with their sweet perfume. The days  were gradually lengthening, and we felt as if fast approaching a warmer  latitude, where--                                \"The green hills        Are clothed with early blossoms, through the grass        The quick-eyed lizard rustles, and the bills        Of summer birds sing welcome as ye pass;        Flowers, fresh in hue, and many in their class,        Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes        Dance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;        The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes,      Kiss'd by the breath of heaven, seems colour'd by its skies.\"    We reached Cannes in the last glow of the setting sun, the crimson,  purple, green and orange contrasting, harmonizing, blending, and slowly  settling into the neutral tints of evening. By six o'clock we were at  the Hotel Windsor, and fortunately secured a bedroom on the fourth  floor, from the windows of which we had a splendid view of the sea.    The \"Windsor\" is beautifully situated on the hillside, some ten minutes'  walk from the shore. It is surrounded by very pretty and tasteful  gardens, well stocked with flowers of all kinds, roses being most  conspicuous, while the perfume of the orange trees ascends from the  valley below. I should think this hotel was much more healthy than those  situate lower down and close to the sea, catching the upper drainage.    The interior is well appointed in every way, with a comfortable, homely  air about it. The landlord, a man of some refinement, is not above  personally looking after the welfare of his visitors. But he is  evidently a little too indulgent, for he allows pianofortes in the  bedrooms, and the young ladies in the room next to ours strummed away  till a very late hour at night, when we wished to sleep, tired with the  day's travel, and anxious to rise early the next morning. We thought two  good pianos in the drawing-room below quite sufficient for the musical  exercise of young ladies, and for the comfort of all at an hotel. We  supposed, however, that its being Christmas-time was probably the cause  of the nocturnal music, of which we were the somewhat reluctant and  suffering listeners.    After engaging our room, we sauntered out on a voyage of discovery and  as an appetizer for dinner, and were so fortunate as to meet an old  friend, who was staying at the same hotel. Under his kind pilotage we  had a very pleasant walk on the sea-shore, listening to the waves  dashing and tumbling against the sea-wall.    At Cannes there is neither harbour nor roadstead, but only a small bay  or cove, appropriately called Gulfe de la Napoul; and it is indeed  worthy of its name, being a miniature Bay of Naples,--but without its  Vesuvius. It is, however, so shallow that the coasting vessels that use  it are obliged to anchor at some distance from the shore, exposed to the  full action of the swell. Yet in spite of this disadvantage, Cannes is  for its size a busy and populous little town.    Immediately opposite are the Isles de Lerins, St. Honorat and St.  Marguerite. On the latter is Fort Montuy, where the \"man with the iron  mask\" was confined from 1686 to 1698, and which has more recently been  the prison of Marshal Bazaine. St. Honorat has its name from a monastery  founded in the fifth century by St. Honoratius, Bishop of Arles. These  islands abound in rabbits and partridges.    Until modern scientists discovered it to be otherwise, the Mediterranean  was supposed to have no tide, and was called by poets \"the tideless  sea.\" It has but a very slight ebb and flow, and this in most places is  scarcely perceptible. The greatest rise and fall of tide in any part of  this great inland sea does not exceed about six feet. Here it appears  always high water; the long stretches of sand, shingle, and rock that  provide such delightful strolls to those visiting the shores of our own  dear island home at low tide, are nowhere to be found in this part of  the world, and thus on coming to the Mediterranean we lose one of the  usual charms of a visit to the sea coast.    We found it necessary to walk briskly, as the fall in temperature is  very great in one short hour after sunset. Indeed, those who come here  essentially for health generally contrive to get housed about four p.m.    Our olfactory nerves had already told us that in this lovely little  seaside paradise there are such prosaic things as defective drains. This  is more detectable in the evening on the beach, than elsewhere, in the  daytime; but is being rectified as the town grows.    It was Christmas Day, and on returning to the Hotel Windsor we found the  large dining-room tastefully decorated with evergreens and flowers, and,  by the kind and thoughtful attention of the landlord, we felt the  absence from dear home at this joyous time less than we might otherwise  have done. We had our _tete-a-tete_ dinner, and toasted our friends in  Old England, who probably included us in their \"absent friends and dear  ones abroad.\"    My wife admired the handsome net mosquito curtains around our bed, but I  rather shuddered at the memories they awakened, having had some  experience of tropical climates--the river Zambezi, for instance, where  a single tiny insect of the Zebra species nearly drove me out of my  senses when suffering from fever. Probably, however, the mosquito only  visits Cannes in the summer, though my wife declared she heard a buzz,  and experienced a bite. It was certainly consolatory to think that I was  no longer considered tempting enough, by these insatiable torments.    The next morning we realized something of the beauty of Cannes. It was  so pleasant to dress by the open French windows, and enjoy the freshness  of the morning air, the warmth of the sun, and the delicious perfume of  the roses and orange blossoms rising from the gardens beneath. The birds  flitting about, with joyous song; the lovely blue sea in the distance;  and above, the cloudless sky. We felt in no hurry for breakfast, and in  imagination pictured to ourselves dear foggy London, cold and wet as we  had left it. This was indeed a grateful contrast!    When we did descend, however, our tea and toast were thoroughly enjoyed,  thanks to the appetizing air; and it was a pleasure to see our  fellow-guests sunning themselves in the gardens, and making plans for  the day's excursion and pleasure.    Cannes is essentially the beautiful and peaceful abode of the invalid,  whose desire is health. A few years since, it was a very small place  indeed, but can now boast of its sixty large hotels; and new roads and  boulevards are being opened in all directions. The Count de Chambord,[B]  and other lucky owners of property here, must feel highly gratified at  the rise in the value of land.    Cannes stretches along the sea-shore from north to south, and is  protected from the _mistral_ and other cold winds by the fine Esterel  mountain range. There is one long main street running parallel to the  beach, which contains many good shops and _cafes_. Some of the houses  are built in a line facing the sea, and divided from it by gardens and  promenades; others are clustered on the slope of the hill, which is  surmounted by a picturesque old castle. At the north end, high up at the  back of Cannes, is the charming little village of Le Cainet: a new  boulevard is now opened connecting the two. This is the warmest part,  and the most suitable for patients. There are many exceedingly pretty  and luxuriously appointed villas nestled amidst the trees and gardens,  looking refreshingly cool with their green jalousie verandahs. Handsome  carriages roll along, and one is reminded of some of the most  fashionable of our own watering-places. The stabling for the horses is  beautifully clean and neat; roses, jessamine, and flowers of every kind  climbing over and around the walls and trellis-work, affording a  pleasant shade from the scorching heat of the _December_ sun.

[Illustration: Details of China Closet]    Cut the tenons on the front boards back 1/4 in. from the face as shown  in the end view. The boards should be finished on the outside sides and  edges. The end pieces are fitted and finished in a similar manner except  that the inside edge is rabbeted for the glass as shown. The side  pieces are also rabbeted for the glass and the posts have grooves 1/2  in. deep cut in them to hold these side pieces. They are glued in place  and this can be done after the frame is put together.    [Illustration: China Closet Complete]    The two shelves are finished on both sides and the front edges. The  doors are fitted in the usual manner by a tenon and mortise joint at the  ends. They are rabbeted on the inside for the glass and are finished on  all sides.    Before gluing any of the parts together, see that they all fit and go  together perfectly square. The posts, side, and front pieces should be  glued and assembled, then the top and bottom boards put in place to hold  the frame square when the clamps are put on. Leave dry for about 24  hours, then scrape all the surplus glue from about the joints as the  finish will not take when there is any glue. Fasten the top and bottom  boards to the frame by means of screws through cleats as shown in the  drawing. The backing is put on and finished on the front side. A mirror  can be put in the back without much trouble, if it is desired. The  shelves should be put in place and held at the back by screws through  the backing and at the front by two small blocks on the posts as shown.    After the closet is all assembled it should be thoroughly gone over with  fine sandpaper before any finish is applied. It can be finished in any  one of the many mission stains which are supplied by the trade for this  purpose.          A LEATHER-COVERED FOOTSTOOL      The illustration shows a very handy footstool in mission style. The  following list of materials will be needed:      4 oak posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 12 in., S-4-S.    2 sides, 3/4 by 3 by 12 in., soft wood.    2 ends, 3/4 by 3 by 8 in., soft wood.    1 bottom, 3/4 by 8 by 12 in., soft wood.    1 small box of 8 oz. tacks    2-1/2 doz. ornamental head nails.    1 piece of dark leather, 16 by 20 in.    1/2 lb. hair and a small portion of mission stain.    The posts are the only parts made of quarter-sawed oak, the other  parts, being covered with leather, can be made of any kind of soft wood.  Chamfer the top end of each post, and taper the lower ends as shown in  detail. When this is done the mortises can be cut for the sides as shown  in the post detail. When cutting the mortises and tenons take care to  make them fit perfectly, as there is nothing to brace the legs at the  bottom. The strength of the stool depends upon the joints. Make the  surface of the posts smooth by first using No. 1 sandpaper, then  finishing with No. 00.    [Illustration: Footstool Leather Covered]    The parts are now assembled. First clamp the ends together, using plenty  of glue on the joints, and drive some small nails on the inside of the  posts through the tenon ends. When the glue has set, the remaining sides  can be put together the same as the ends. Fit the bottom on the inside  about 1 in. from the top. This can be made fast by driving nails  through the sides and ends of the board. The finishing is done by  putting on the mission stain as the directions state on the can, then  wax the surface to get a dull gloss.    [Illustration: Details of Footstool]    The leather is now put on. Notch out the corners to fit around the  posts, but do not cut the ends off. Lap them under the cover. Before  nailing on the cover fix the hair evenly over the top, about 6 in. deep.  Draw the leather over the hair and fasten the edges with the 8-oz.  tacks. The ornamental nails are driven in last, as shown in the drawing,  to make a good appearance.          ARTS-CRAFTS MANTEL CLOCK      The clock shown in the illustration was designed especially for rooms  furnished in mission style. The clock, however, may be made of mahogany  or other wood to match the furniture in any room where it is to be  placed. If the mission effect is desired, an oxidized or copper sash  should be used. Movements can be bought at the salesroom of a clock  company. A movement should be selected that is wide enough from the  front to the back to allow the clock case to be made sufficiently deep  for standing without being easily upset.    [Illustration: Mantel Clock with Wood and Copper Front]    Quarter-sawed white oak is the best material for this clock, but any  other wood which works easily and takes a stain well may be used. Two  pieces, 3/8 in. thick, 6-1/2 in. wide, and 8-1/2 in. long, will be  needed for the front and back. One piece, 5 in. wide, 6 in. long, and  with a thickness sufficient for the clock movement, is needed for the  middle part. The thickness of this piece depends on the movement  secured.    After the front and back pieces are finished, and a piece of hammered  copper screwed on the front as shown in the drawing, the middle piece  must be made just thick enough to make the whole distance from the front  of the copper to the back of the clock equal to the depth of the  movement. Plane one edge on both front and back pieces. Lay out the  design and the centers for the circular holes from this planed edge.  Use a plane and chisel to cut the outside design. The hole can be bored  out with an expansive bit, or sawed out with a scroll saw, and filed  perfectly round with a half-round wood file. The bit will give the best  results. If the bit is used, bore holes in a piece of scrap wood until  the exact size is found.    [Illustration: Details of Mantel Clock]    The outside design of the piece of copper is made to correspond to the  design of the clock. The circular hole in the copper can be cut with the  expansive bit by first punching a hole in the center to receive the spur  of the bit, placing on a block of wood and boring through a little way.  The spur on the cutter will cut out the copper. Fasten the copper to the  front with copper nails or round-headed screws.    If good glue can be had, the three pieces of wood may be glued together.  If the glue cannot be relied upon, put in two flat-headed screws from  the back.    The clock can be finished with a dark stain and waxed, or, as it is  small, it can be easily fumed. If stain is used, stain and wax the  pieces before putting them together. The fuming process is more easily  done after the clock is assembled. Secure a bucket, a peck measure, or  any receptacle large enough, when inverted, to put over the clock. Pour  about 2 oz. of strong ammonia into a saucer or small pan. Support the  clock above the saucer and cover both with the inverted bucket. Allow it  to stand for three or four days--the longer it stands the darker the  fumed finish will be. Finish with two coats of bleached wax. Do not use  ordinary uncolored wax, as it will show in the unfilled pores of the  wood. The works of the clock should not be in the frame while fuming.          A MUSIC STAND      The attractive and useful piece of mission furniture shown in the  accompanying illustration is made of quarter-sawed oak. Considerable  labor can be saved in its construction if the stock is ordered from the  mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. The stock list consists of  the following pieces:      1 top, 3/4 by 16 by 20 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 11-1/2 by 15 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 12 by 15 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 14-1/2 by 15 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 16 by 15 in., S-1-S.    4 legs, 3/4 by 5 by 41 in., S-2-S.    2 lower crosspieces, 3/4 by 3 by 9 in., S-2-S.    2 upper crosspieces, 3/4 by 2 by 9 in., S-2-S.    4 end slats, 5/8 by 2 by 34 in., S-2-S.    20 R.H. screws, 2 in. long.    The four shelves and the top are so wide that it will be necessary to  make them from two or more pieces glued together. The top should have a  1/4-in. bevel cut around the upper edge as shown in the drawing.    [Illustration: Details of Music Stand]    [Illustration: Music Stand Complete]    The curve of the legs can be cut with a bracket saw or a drawknife,  care being taken to get the edges square and smooth. The four  crosspieces are fastened to the legs by means of tenons and mortises.  The end slats are joined to the crosspieces in the same manner. The legs  can be assembled in pairs with the slats and crosspieces in place. They  can be glued in this position, and when dry they should be carefully  gone over with fine sandpaper to remove all rough spots. The shelves  can now be put in place. They should be fastened to the legs with  round-headed screws. The top is also fastened on with screws. When  applying the finish, remove the top board and the shelves and finish  them separately. The stand can be finished in any one of the many  mission stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.    This handsome piece of furniture can be used as a magazine stand as well  as a music stand, if desired, and, if it is made and finished well, it  will prove an ornament to any home.          MAKING SCREWS HOLD IN THE END GRAIN OF WOOD      [Illustration: MAKING SCREWS HOLD IN END GRAIN]    It is often necessary to fasten one piece of wood to the end of another  by means of screws. Wood being a fibrous material, it can be readily  understood that when a screw having sharp threads is put in the end  grain parallel to these fibers the threads cut them in such a way that,  when an extra strain is put upon the parts, the screw pulls out,  bringing with it the severed fibers. The accompanying sketch shows how  this difficulty may be overcome, and at the same time make the screw  hold firmly. A hole is bored and a dowel, preferably of hardwood, glued  in it, the grain at right angles to that of the piece.    The size of the dowel, and its location, can be determined by the "]]]
