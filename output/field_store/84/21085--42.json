I will tell you all I know of Him, for my mistress frequently spoke  to me of Him; and hoped, I think, that in time I should accept Him,  as she did. When you join your people, it is as necessary that you  should be of their religion, as of their race;\" and so, in time,  Harry learned at least the elements of Christianity.    As usual he had been, at the age of six, marked, like Soyera, with  three perpendicular lines on the forehead--the sign of the  worshippers of Vishnu.    \"You are twelve years old now, Harry,\" Soyera said to the boy, one  day. \"Now I must do what I have concluded, after a talk with  Ramdass and Sufder, is the best thing for you. We have agreed that  it will be better that you should not join your countrymen, and  claim to be the son of Major Lindsay, until you are a man. I do not  know what they would do with you. They might send you back to  England, but I cannot say what would become of you there; but we  have agreed that, when you do join them, you must be like other  young English gentlemen, and not be looked down upon as one who,  though he has a white skin, is but a Mahratta peasant.    \"In the first place, you must learn to speak English.\"    \"But I do speak English!\" Harry said, in surprise.    \"Yes, such English as I do; but that is not as the white sahibs  speak it. We who have learned it speak the right word, but not in  the right way. I have seen young white ladies, when they first came  out here, and came to the house of your mother, sometimes smile and  scarcely understand what I said to them. It is not like that that  you must talk English--good enough for an ayah, not good enough for  a sahib--so we have decided, Sufder, Ramdass and I, that you must  go down to Bombay, and learn to talk proper English.    \"We have thought much how this shall be done, and have settled that  our thinking, here, is no good. I must wait till I get to Bombay,  where I can get advice from people I know.\"    \"Will you stay there with me, Soyera?\"    \"I cannot say what will be best,\" she answered, gravely; \"I must  wait till I get there. Ramdass will go down with me. It is a good  time for him to go. The harvest work is done, he can be spared for  a month. He would like to go. He has never seen Bombay. We shall go  in the wagon.\"    The distance from Jooneer to Bombay was but about eighty miles, and  the journey was performed in five days, and Ramdass took down a  light load of maize, whose sale would pay the expenses of their  journey. Soyera rode and slept on the maize, except in two  villages, where she was able to procure a lodging for the night.  Ramdass and Harry walked by the bullocks, and slept at night by the  roadside, wrapped in their blankets.    On arriving at Bombay they put up at a khan, in the native town  and, the next morning, leaving Ramdass and Harry to wander about  and look at the wonders of the city, Soyera went to the shop of a  Parsee merchant, who was in the habit of supplying the canteen of  the troops, contracted for supplies of forage and other matters,  and carried on the business of a native banker. She had often been  to his place with Mrs. Lindsay; and had, from the time that she  entered her service, deposited her savings with him. She had, in  the first place, asked her master to keep them for her; but he had  advised her to go to Jeemajee.    The Parsee was, himself, in his shop. She went up to him.    \"You do not remember me, sahib?\" she said. \"I was the ayah of Major  Lindsay. I was often here with the mem-sahib.\"    \"I remember you, now,\" he said. \"I do not often forget those I have  known. Yes; your master and mistress were killed, at their little  camp on the Concan. Nothing was heard of you, if I remember  rightly. I have some money of yours in my hands. Have you the  receipts?\"    \"I have them, sahib; but it is not for that that I come to see you.  I wish to ask your advice on a private matter.\"    The Parsee looked a little surprised.    \"Come in here with me,\" he said, leading the way to his private  room, behind the shop.    \"Now, what is it?\" he asked, as he closed the door behind them.    \"It was believed, sahib, that Major Lindsay's infant boy was  killed, at that time, like all others in the camp. It was not so. I  saved him. It is about him that I want to speak to you.\"    The Parsee thought for a moment.    \"Yes, there was a child. Its body was not found, and was supposed  to have been eaten by the jackals. Is it alive still?\"    \"Yes, sahib, I have brought him up as my own. His skin has been  always stained; and none but my brother--with whom I live--his  wife, and one other, know that he is English. I love him as my own  child. I have taught him English, as I speak it; but I want him, in  time, to be an English sahib, and for that he must learn proper  English.\"    \"But why have you not brought him down here?\" the Parsee said.    \"Who would have looked after him, and cared for him, sahib, as I,  his nurse, have done? Who could have taken him? What would have  become of him? I am a poor woman, and do not know how these things  would be. I said to myself:    \"'It will be better that he should live with me, till he is old  enough to go down as a young man, and say to the Governor:    \"'\"I am the son of Major Lindsay. I can talk Mahratti like a  native. I can ride and use my sword. I can speak English well. I  can be useful.\"    \"'Then, perhaps for his father's sake, the Governor will say:    \"'\"I will make you an officer. If there are troubles in the Deccan,  you will be more useful than those sahibs who do not know the  language.\"'    \"I can do all that for him, but I cannot teach him to speak as  English sahibs speak; and that is why I have come to you. You have  twelve hundred rupees of mine, in your hands; for I laid out  nothing while I was in the sahib's service, and my mistress was  very kind, and often gave me presents. My brother, Ramdass, had  five hundred rupees saved; and this he has given to me, for he,  too, loves the boy. Thus there are seventeen hundred rupees, and  this I would pay for him to be, for two years, with someone where  he would learn to speak English as sahibs do, so that none can say  this white boy is not English.    \"Then he will go back, for two or three years, to Jooneer. He will  learn to use his arms, and to ride, and to be a man, until he is of  an age to come down and say:    \"'I am the son of Major Lindsay.'\"    \"But if you were to tell this, at once,\" the Parsee said, \"they  would doubtless send him home, to England, to be educated.\"    \"And what would he do there, sahib? He would have no friends, none  to care for him; and while his Mahratti tongue would be of great  service to him, here, it would be useless to him in his own  country.    \"Do not say that my plan cannot be carried out, sahib. For twelve  years I have thought it over. I have taught him all that I could,  so far; and convinced myself that it would be the best. The boy  loves me, and is happy: he would be miserable among strangers, who  would laugh at his English, and would make him unhappy.\"    Jeemajee sat for some time in thought.    \"I am not sure that your plan is not the best,\" he said, \"and after  saving his life, and caring for him, at the risk of your own, for  all these years, you have assuredly a better right than any other  to say what shall be done now. I will think over what you have  asked of me. It is not very easy to find just such a home as you  want, but I should consider the sum you offer is sufficient to  induce many Englishmen living here to take him; but it is not  everyone from whom he would learn English, as you would wish him to  do, or who could teach him the manners of white officers.    \"Come to me tomorrow evening, but you must not expect that I shall  be able to answer you then. I must think it over, and make  enquiries.\"    It was three days, indeed, before anything came of Soyera's visits  to the Parsee trader; then he said:    \"I think that I have found out just the place of which you are in  search. I spoke to a friend yesterday, and he at once mentioned one  whom I wonder I had not thought of, at once. Some years ago a  cadet, who came out here with a young wife, died shortly after his  arrival. As he had only been four years in the service, the pension  of his wife was but a small one. She did not go back to England, as  widows generally do. I know not why, except that I once heard two  officers speaking of her. They said that they believed her family  had quarrelled with her, for her marriage, and that she was too  proud to go back again. She had two girls, who must be about the  age of this boy. Her pension was not sufficient for her to live  upon comfortably, and she opened a little school for the children  of officers here.    \"There are not many, you know, for they are generally sent home to  England, when they are quite young. But she has always had four or  five, sometimes eight or ten. They come to her every morning, and  go home in the middle of the day, and she sees no more of them.    \"After I had heard this, I went to her. I supply her with many  things, for she gets her books and other things from me. I said to  her:    \"'I have a white boy whose father and mother are dead. He is twelve  years old. There are reasons why I cannot tell you who they were,  but I can say that the boy's father was an English officer. He has  been brought up by natives, and speaks English in the way that  natives speak it. Those who have brought him up desire that he  should learn to talk English well, and learn to have good manners,  so that some day, when he goes to England, people should not say of  him:    \"'\"This is not an English gentleman, or he would not speak like  that.\"'    \"I said that I had interested myself in the matter, and knew that  it was right, and had come to her to ask her if she would take him  into her house, which was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#6)"],[1,"to the honour of the second rank. Those who had failed must  perforce continue as Wood-gatherers for another period of three months.    There remained one further and higher rank, only attainable after six  months' ardent and trustworthy service as Fire-makers. To-night three  girls were to be admitted to its privileges, and Helen Cooper, Doris  Deane, and Ulyth Stanton presented themselves. With grave faces they  repeated the Torch-bearer's desire:         \"That light which has been given to me I desire to pass undimmed to       others.\"    Ulyth kissed Mrs. Arnold's pretty hand as the long-coveted yellow badge  was fastened on to her dress, side by side with the Union Jack. She was  so glad to be a Torch-bearer at last. She had become a candidate when  the League was first founded three years ago, and all that time she had  been slowly working towards the desired end of the third rank. One or  two slips had hindered her progress, but last term she had made a very  special effort, and it was sweet to meet with her reward. Torch-bearers  were mostly to be found among the Sixth and Upper Fifth; she was the  only girl in V B who had won so high a place. She touched the yellow  ribbon tenderly. It meant so much to her.    Now that the serious business of the meeting was over, the fun was about  to begin. The big camp-kettle was produced and filled at the stream, and  then set to boil upon the embers. Cups and spoons made their appearance.  Cocoa and biscuits were to be the order of the evening, followed by as  many songs, dances, and games as time permitted. Squatting on the grass,  the girls made a circle round their council-fire. Marjorie Earnshaw, one  of the Sixth, had brought her guitar, and struck the strings every now  and then as an earnest of the music she intended to bring from it later  on. Everybody was in a jolly mood, and inclined to laugh at any pun,  however feeble. Mrs. Arnold, always bright and animated, surpassed  herself, and waxed so amusing that the circle grew almost hysterical.  The Wood-gatherers, whose office it was to mix the cocoa, supplied cup  after cup, and refilled the kettle so often that they ventured to air  the time-honoured joke that the stream would run dry, for which ancient  chestnut they were pelted with pebbles.    When at last nobody could even pretend to be thirsty any longer, the  cups were rinsed in the pool and stacked under a tree, and the concert  commenced. Part-songs and catches sounded delightful in the open air,  and solos, sung to the accompaniment of Marjorie's guitar, were equally  effective. The girls roared the choruses to popular national ditties,  and special favourites were repeated again and again. Several  step-dances were executed, and had a weird effect in the unsteady light  of the waning fire. Mrs. Arnold, who was a splendid elocutionist, gave a  recitation on an incident in the American War, and was enthusiastically  encored. The moon had risen high in the sky, and was peeping through the  tree-tops as if curious to see who had invaded so sylvan a spot as the  glade. The silver beams caught the ripples of the stream and made the  shadows seem all the darker.    It was a glorious beginning for the new term, as everybody agreed, and  an earnest of the fun that was in store later on.    \"We shan't be able to camp out next meeting, but we'll have high jinks  in the hall,\" purred Beth Broadway.    \"Yes; Mrs. Arnold says she has a lovely programme for the winter, and  we're to have candles instead of fuel,\" agreed Lizzie Lonsdale, who had  been raised that evening to the rank of Fire-maker.    \"Trust Mrs. Arnold to find something new for us to do!\" murmured Ulyth,  looking fondly in the direction of her ideal.    \"My gracious, I call this meeting no end!\" piped a cheerful voice in her  ear; and Rona, smiling with all-too-obtrusive friendliness, plumped down  by her side. \"You've good times here, and no mistake! I think I'll be a  candidate myself next, if that's the game to play. You're a  high-and-mighty one, aren't you? Let's have a look at your badge!\"    \"If you dare to touch it!\" flared Ulyth, putting up her hand to guard  her cherished token.    \"Why, I wouldn't do it any harm, I promise you; I wouldn't finger it! It  means something, doesn't it? I didn't quite catch what it was. You might  tell me. How'm I ever to get to know if you won't?\"    Rona's clear blue eyes, unconsciously wistful, looked straight into  Ulyth's. The latter sprang to her feet without a word. The force of her  own motto seemed suddenly to be revealed to her. She rushed away into  the shadow of the trees to think it over for herself.         \"That light which has been given to me I desire to pass undimmed to       others.\"    Those were the words she had repeated so earnestly less than an hour  ago. And she was already about to make them a mockery! Yes, that was  what Mrs. Arnold had meant. She had known it all the time, but she would  not acknowledge it even to her innermost heart. Was this what was  required from a Torch-bearer--to pass on her own refinement and culture  to a girl whose crudities offended every particle of her fastidious  taste? Ulyth sat down on a stone and wept hot, bitter, rebellious tears.  She understood only too well why she had been so miserable for the last  three days. She had disliked Miss Bowes for hinting that she was not  keeping her word, and had told herself that she was a much-tried and  ill-used person.    \"I must do it, I must, or fail at the very beginning!\" she sobbed. \"I  know what Mother would say. It's got to be; if for nothing else, for the  sake of the school. A Torch-bearer mustn't shirk and break her pledge.  Oh, how I shall loathe it, hate it! Ulyth Stanton, do you realize what  you're undertaking? Your whole term's going to be spoilt.\"    The big bell in the tower was clanging its summons to return, with  short, impatient strokes. Everybody joined hands in a circle round the  ashes of the camp-fire, to sing in a low chant the good-night song of  the League and \"God Save the Queen\". Mr. Arnold, who had come to fetch  his wife, was sounding his hooter as a signal on the drive. The  evening's fun was over. Regretfully the girls collected cups, spoons,  and kettle, and made their way back to the house.    On Sunday morning Ulyth, with a very red face, marched into the study,  and announced:    \"Miss Bowes, I've been having a tussle. One-half of me said: 'Don't  have Rona in your room at any price!' and the other half said: 'Let her  stop!' I've decided to keep her.\"    \"I knew you would, when you'd thought it over,\" beamed Miss Bowes.    \"Are all New Zealanders the same?\" asked Ulyth. \"I've not met one  before.\"    \"Certainly not. Most of them are quite as cultured and up-to-date as  ourselves. There are splendid schools in New Zealand, and excellent  opportunities for study of every kind. Poor Rona, unfortunately, has had  to live on a farm far away from civilization, and her education and  welfare in every respect seem to have been utterly neglected. Don't take  her as a type of New Zealand! But she'll soon improve if we're all  prepared to help her. I'm glad you're ready to be her real friend.\"    \"I'll try my best!\" sighed Ulyth.          CHAPTER IV    A Blackberry Foray      Having made up her mind to accept the responsibility which fate, through  the agency of the magazine editor, had thrust upon her, Ulyth,  metaphorically speaking, set her teeth, and began to take Rona seriously  in hand. Being ten months older than her protegee, in a higher form,  and, moreover, armed with full authority from Miss Bowes, she assumed  command of the bedroom, and tried to regulate the chaos that reigned on  her comrade's side of it. Rona submitted with an air of amused good  nature to have her clothes arranged in order in her drawers, her shoes  put away in the cupboard, and her toilet articles allotted places on her  washstand and dressing-table. She even consented to give some thought to  her personal appearance, and borrowed Ulyth's new manicure set.    \"You're mighty particular,\" she objected. \"What does it all matter? Miss  Bowes gave me such a talking-to, and said I'd got to do exactly what you  told me; and before I came, Dad rubbed it into me to copy you for all I  was worth, so I suppose I'll have to try. I guess you'll find it a job  to civilize me though.\" And her eyes twinkled.    Ulyth thought, with a mental sigh, that she probably would find it \"a  job\".    \"No one bothered about it at home,\" Rona continued cheerfully. \"Dad did  say sometimes I was growing up a savage, but Mrs. Barker never cared.  She let me do what I liked, so long as I didn't trouble her. She was no  lady! We couldn't get a lady to stay at our out-of-the-way block. Dad  used to be a swell in England once, but that was before I was born.\"    Ulyth began to understand, and her disgust changed to a profound pity. A  motherless girl who had run wild in the backwoods, her father probably  out all day, her only female guide a woman of the backwoods, whose  manners were presumably of the roughest--this had been Rona's training.  No wonder she lacked polish!    \"When I compare her home with my home and my lovely mother,\" thought  Ulyth, \"yes--there's certainly a vast amount to be passed on.\"    The other girls, who had never expected her to keep Rona in her bedroom,  were inclined to poke fun at the proceeding.    \"Your bear cub will need training before you teach her to dance,\" said  Stephanie Radford tauntingly.    \"She has no parlour tricks at present,\" sniggered Addie Knighton.    \"Are you posing as Valentine and Orson?\" laughed Gertie Oliver. Gertrude  had been Ulyth's room-mate last term, and felt aggrieved to be  superseded.    \"I call her the cuckoo,\" said Mary Acton. \"Do you remember the young one  we found last spring, sprawling all over the nest, and opening its huge,  gaping beak?\"    In spite of her ignorance and angularities there was a certain"]]]
