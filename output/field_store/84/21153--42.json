But the hawks themselves were more interesting than their unbidden  guests. Ismaques, honest fellow that he is, mates for life, and comes  back to the same nest year after year. The only exception to this rule  that I know is in the case of a fishhawk, whom I knew well as a boy, and  who lost his mate one summer by an accident. The accident came from a  gun in the hands of an unthinking sportsman. The grief of Ismaques was  evident, even to the unthinking. One could hear it in the lonely,  questioning cry that he sent out over the still summer woods; and see it  in the sweep of his wings as he went far afield to other ponds, not to  fish, for Ismaques never fishes on his neighbor's preserves, but to  search for his lost mate. For weeks he lingered in the old haunts,  calling and searching everywhere; but at last the loneliness and the  memories were too much for him. He left the place long before the time  of migration had come; and the next spring a strange couple came to the  spot, repaired the old nest, and went fishing in the pond. Ordinarily  the birds respect each other's fishing grounds, and especially the old  nests; but this pair came and took possession without hesitation, as if  they had some understanding with the former owner, who never came back  again.    The old spruce on the mountain side had been occupied many years by my  fishing friends. As is usually the case, it had given up its life to its  bird masters. The oil from their frequent feastings had soaked into the  bark, following down and down, checking the sap's rising, till at last  it grew discouraged and ceased to climb. Then the tree died and gave up  its branches, one by one, to repair the nest above. The jagged, broken  ends showed everywhere how they had been broken off to supply the hawks'  necessities.    There is a curious bit of building lore suggested by these broken  branches, that one may learn for himself any springtime by watching the  birds at their nest building. Large sticks are required for a  foundation. The ground is strewed with such; but Ismaques never comes  down to the ground if he can avoid it. Even when he drops an unusually  heavy fish, in his flight above the trees, he looks after it  regretfully, but never follows. He may be hungry, but he will not set  his huge hooked talons on the earth. He cannot walk, and loses all his  power there. So he goes off and fishes patiently, hours long, to replace  his lost catch.    When he needs sticks for his nest, he searches out a tree and breaks off  the dead branches by his weight. If the stick be stubborn, he rises far  above it and drops like a cannon ball, gripping it in his claws and  snapping it short off at the same instant by the force of his blow.  Twice I have been guided to where Ismaques and his mate were collecting  material by reports like pistol shots ringing through the wood, as the  great birds fell upon the dead branches and snapped them off. Once, when  he came down too hard, I saw him fall almost to the ground, flapping  lustily, before he found his wings and sailed away with his four-foot  stick triumphantly.    There is another curious bit of bird lore that I discovered here in the  autumn, when, much later than usual, I came back through the lake.  Ismaques, when he goes away for the long winter at the South, does not  leave his house to the mercy of the winter storms until he has first  repaired it. Large fresh sticks are wedged in firmly across the top of  the nest; doubtful ones are pulled out and carefully replaced, and the  whole structure made shipshape for stormy weather. This careful repair,  together with the fact that the nest is always well soaked in oil, which  preserves it from the rain, saves a deal of trouble for Ismaques. He  builds for life and knows, when he goes away in the fall, that, barring  untoward accidents, his house will be waiting for him with the quiet  welcome of old associations when he comes back in the spring. Whether  this is a habit of all ospreys, or only of the two on Big Squatuk  Lake--who were very wise birds in other ways--I am unable to say.    What becomes of the young birds is also, to me, a mystery. The home ties  are very strong, and the little ones stay with the parents much longer  than most other birds do; but when the spring comes you will see only  the old birds at the home nest. The young come back to the same general  neighborhood, I think; but where the lake is small they never build nor  trespass on the same waters. As with the kingfishers and sheldrakes,  each pair of birds seem to have their own pond or portion; but by what  old law of the waters they find and stake their claim is yet to be  discovered.    There were two little ones in the nest when I first found it; and I used  to watch them in the intervals when nothing was stirring in the  underbrush near my hiding place. They were happy, whistling, little  fellows, well fed and contented with the world. At times they would  stand for hours on the edge of the nest, looking down over the slanting  tree-tops to the lake, finding the great rustling green world, and the  passing birds, and the glinting of light on the sparkling water, and the  hazy blue of the distant mountains marvelously interesting, if one could  judge from their attitude and their pipings. Then a pair of broad wings  would sweep into sight, and they would stretch their wings wide and  break into eager whistlings,--_Pip, pip, ch'wee? chip, ch'weeeeee?_ \"did  you get him? is he a big one, mother?\" And they would stand tiptoeing  gingerly about the edge of the great nest, stretching their necks  eagerly for a first glimpse of the catch.    At times only one of the old birds would go a-fishing, while the other  watched the nest. But when luck was poor both birds would seek the lake.  At such times the mother bird, larger and stronger than the male, would  fish along the shore, within sight and hearing of her little ones. The  male, meanwhile, would go sweeping down the lake to the trout pools at  the outlet, where the big chub lived, in search of better fishing  grounds. If the wind were strong, you would see a curious bit of sea  lore as he came back with his fish. He would never fly straight against  the wind, but tack back and forth, as if he had learned the trick from  watching the sailor fishermen of the coast beating back into harbor.  And, watching him through your glass, you would see that he always  carried his fish endwise and head first, so as to present the least  possible resistance to the breeze.    While the young were being fed, you were certain to gain new respect for  Ismaques by seeing how well he brought up his little ones. If the fish  were large, it was torn into shreds and given piecemeal to the young,  each of whom waited for his turn with exemplary patience. There was no  crowding or pushing for the first and biggest bite, such as you see in a  nest of robins. If the fish were small, it was given entire to one of  the young, who worried it down as best he could, while the mother bird  swept back to the lake for another. The second nestling stood on the  edge of the nest meanwhile, whistling good luck and waiting his turn,  without a thought, apparently, of seizing a share from his mate beside  him.           *       *       *       *       *    Just under the hawks a pair of jays had built their nest among the  sticks of Ismaques' dwelling, and raised their young on the abundant  crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. It was curious and  intensely interesting to watch the change which seemed to be going on  in the jays' disposition by reason of the unusual friendship. Deedeeaskh  the jay has not a friend among the wood folk. They all know he is a  thief and a meddler, and hunt him away without mercy if they find him  near their nests. But the great fishhawks welcomed him, trusted him; and  he responded nobly to the unusual confidence. He never tried to steal  from the young, not even when the mother bird was away, but contented  himself with picking up the stray bits that they had left. And he more  than repaid Ismaques by the sharp watch which he kept over the nest, and  indeed over all the mountain side. Nothing passes in the woods without  the jay's knowledge; and here he seemed, for all the world, like a  watchful terrier, knowing that he had only to bark to bring a power of  wing and claw sufficient to repel any danger. When prowlers came down  from the mountain to feast on the heads and bones scattered about the  foot of the tree, Deedeeaskh dropped down among them and went dodging  about, whistling his insatiable curiosity. So long as they took only  what was their own, he made no fuss about it; but he was there to watch,  and he let them know sharply their mistake, if they showed any desire to  cast evil eyes at the nest above.    [Illustration: \"PRESENTLY THEY BEGAN TO SWOOP FIERCELY AT SOME ANIMAL\"]    Once, as my canoe was gliding along the shore, I heard the jays'  unmistakable cry of danger. The fishhawks were wheeling in great circles  over the lake, watching for the glint of fish near the surface, when the  cry came, and they darted away for the nest. Pushing out into the lake,  I saw them sweeping above the tree-tops in swift circles, uttering  short, sharp cries of anger. Presently they began to swoop fiercely at  some animal--a fisher, probably--that was climbing the tree below. I  stole up to see what it was; but ere I reached the place they had driven  the intruder away. I heard one of the jays far off in the woods,  following the robber and screaming to let the fishhawks know just where  he was. The other jay sat close by her own little ones, cowering under  the shadow of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#6)"],[1,"should be. We  shall take the chisel No. 10 and sharpen that first, as it is the  easiest to do, and so get a little practise before we try the gouges.  The oilstone and oil have already been described. The first thing is to  well oil the stone and lay it on the bench in a position with its end  toward the operator.    [Illustration: A. ANGLE FOR SOFTWOOD    B. ANGLE FOR HARDWOOD    FIG. 8.]    Tools which are going to be used in soft wood require rather a longer  bevel and more acute edge than when they are wanted for hard wood. Both  angles are shown in Fig. 8. Lay the flat of the tool on the stone at an  angle of about 15 deg., with the handle in the hollow of the right hand, and  two fingers of the left pressed upon the blade as near to the stone as  possible. Then begin rubbing the tool from end to end of the stone,  taking care not to rock the right hand up and down, but to keep it as  level as possible throughout the stroke, bearing heavily on the blade  with the left hand, to keep it well in contact with the stone. Rocking  produces a rounded edge which is fatal to keenness. C (Fig. 9) gives  approximately, to an enlarged scale, the sections of a good edge, and D  that of an imperfect one.    [Illustration: C. GOOD CUTTING EDGE D. BADLY FORMED EDGE. FIG. 9.]    Practise alone will familiarize the muscles of the wrist with the proper  motion, but it is important to acquire this in order to form the correct  habit early. It should be practised very slowly at first, until the  hands get accustomed to the movements. When one side of the tool has  been rubbed bright as far as the cutting edge, turn it over and treat  the other in the same way. Carvers' tools, unlike joiners', are rubbed  on both sides, in the proportion of about two-thirds outside to  one-third inside. When a keen edge has been formed, which can easily be  tested by gently applying the finger, it should be stropped on a piece  of stout leather. It will be found, if the finger is passed down the  tool and over its edge, that the stoning has turned up a burr. This must  be removed by stropping on both sides alternately. A paste composed of  emery and crocus powders mixed with grease is used to smear the leather  before stropping; this can either be procured at the tool shop, or made  by the carver. When the tool has been sufficiently stropped, and all  burr removed, it is ready for use, but it is as well to try it on a  piece of wood first, and test it for burr, and if necessary strop it  again.    Before we leave this tool, however, we shall anticipate a little, and  look at it after it has been used for some time and become blunt. Its  cutting edge and the bevel above it are now polished to a high degree,  owing to friction with the wood. We lay it on the stone, taking care to  preserve the original angle (15 deg.). We find on looking at the tool after  a little rubbing that this time it presents a bright rim along the edge  in contrast with the gray steel which has been in contact with the  stone. This bright rim is part of the polished surface the whole bevel  had before we began this second sharpening, which proves that the actual  edge has not yet touched the stone. We are tempted to lift the right  hand ever so little, and so get rid of this bright rim (sometimes called  the \"candle\"); we shall thus get an edge quicker than if we have to rub  away all the steel behind it. We do this, and soon get our edge; the  bright rim has disappeared, but we have done an unwise thing, and have  not saved much time, because we have begun to make a rounded edge,  which, if carried a little farther, will make the tool useless until it  is reground. There is no help for it: time must be spent and trouble  taken in sharpening tools; with method and care there need be very  little grinding, unless tools are actually broken.    To resume our lesson in tool-sharpening: we can not do much carving with  one chisel, so we shall now take up gouge No. 2 as being the least  difficult. This being a rounded tool, we must turn the stone over and  use the side we have determined to keep for gouges, etc. We commence  rubbing it up and down the stone in the same manner as described for the  chisel, but, in addition, we have now another motion. To bring all the  parts of the edge into contact with the stone the gouge must be rolled  from side to side as it goes up and down. To accomplish this the wrist  should be slowly practised until it gets into step with the up and down  motions; it matters very little whether one turn of the tool is given to  one passage along the stone, or only one turn to many up and down  rubbings. The main thing is evenness of rubbing all along the circular  edge, as if one part gets more than its share the edge becomes wavy,  which is a thing to be avoided as much as possible. When the outside has  been cleanly rubbed up to the edge, the inside is to be rubbed out with  the Washita slip and oil to the extent of about half as much as the  outside. The handle of the tool should be grasped in the left hand,  while its blade rests on a block of wood, or on the oilstone. Hold the  slip between the fingers and thumb, slanting a little over the inner  edge; and work it in a series of short downward strokes, beginning the  stroke at one corner of the gouge and leaving off at the other (see Fig.  10). Strop the outside of the tool, and test for burr, then lay the  leather over the handle of another tool and strop the inside, repeating  the operation until all burr has been removed, when probably the tool  will be ready for use.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    The Veiner requires the same kind of treatment, only as this tool is not  part of a circle in its section (having straight sides), only one-half  must be done at a time; and it is as well to give the straight sides one  stroke or so in every half-dozen all to itself to keep it in shape. Care  must be taken with this tool as it is easily rubbed out of shape. The  inside must be finished off with the Arkansas knife-edged slip, one side  at a time, as it is impossible to sweep out the whole section of these  deep tools at one stroke. Stropping must follow as before, but as this  tool is so small that the leather will not enter its hollow, the leather  must be laid down flat and the hollow of the tool drawn along its edge  until it makes a little ridge for itself which fills the hollow and  clears off burr (see Fig. 11); if any such adheres outside, a slight rub  on the Arkansas stone will probably remove it. When the edges of the  tools begin to get dull, it often happens that they only require to be  stropped, which should be frequently done. As the treatment of all  gouges is more or less like what has been described, practise will  enable the student to adapt it to the shape of the tool which requires  his attention. There remains only the V tool, the Spoon tools, and the  Maccaroni, which all require special attention. The point of the V tool  is so acute that it becomes difficult to clear the inside. A knife-edged  slip is used for this purpose, and it is well also to cut a slip of wood  to a thin edge, and after rubbing it with paste and oil, pass it down  frequently over the point between the sides. Unless a very sharp point  is obtained, this tool is practically useless; the least speck of burr  or dullness will stop its progress or tear up the wood. In sharpening  it, the sides should be pressed firmly on the stone, watching it every  now and then to see what effect is being produced. If a gap begins to  appear on one side, as it often does, then rub the other side until it  disappears, taking care to bear more heavily on the point of the tool  than elsewhere. If the sides get out of shape, pass the tool along the  stone, holding it at right angles to the side of the stone, but at the  proper angle of elevation; in this case the tool is held near its end,  between fingers and thumb. Spoon tools must be held to the stone at a  much higher angle until the cutting edge is in the right relation to the  surface, or they may be drawn sidewise along it, taking care that every  part of the edge comes in contact and receives an equal amount of  rubbing. These may be treated half at a time, or all round, according to  the size and depth of the tool. However it is produced, the one thing  essential is a long straight-sectioned cutting bevel, not a rounded or  obtuse one. Strop the inside by folding up the leather into a little  roll or ball until it fills the hollow of the tool.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    For the small set of tools described in Chapter II one flat oilstone and  two slips will be found sufficient for a beginning, but as a matter of  fact, it will be advisable, as the number of tools is enlarged, to  obtain slips of curves corresponding to the hollows of all gouges as  nearly as possible. Many professional carvers have sets of these slips  for the insides of tools, varying in curves which exactly fit every  hollow tool they possess, including a triangular one for the inside of  the V tool. The same rule sometimes applies to the sweeps of the  outsides of gouges, for these, corresponding channels are ground out in  flat stones, a process which is both difficult and laborious. If the  insides are dealt with on fitting slips, which may be easily adapted to  the purpose by application to a grindstone, the outsides are not so  difficult to manage, so that grooved stones may be dispensed with.    Before we leave the subject of sharpening tools it will be well to  impress upon the beginner the extreme importance of keeping his tools in  good order. When a tool is really sharp it whistles as it works; a dull  tool makes dull work, and the carver loses both time and temper. There  can be no doubt that the great technical skill shown in the works of  Grinling Gibbons and his followers could not have been arrived at  without the help of extraordinarily sharp tools.
