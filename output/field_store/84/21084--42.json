Full of fanatical religious hatred, swarms  of black-bearded Turks rush up to the figure of the crucified Redeemer.  A Mohammedan presses his janissary's cap over the crown of thorns. The  image is carried with wild shrieks round the church, and presumptuous  voices call out scornfully, \"Here you see the God of the Christians.\"    At the high altar a Greek bishop stood in pontifical robes and read mass  over the Christians in a loud and clear voice. His voice never trembled  for a moment. He wished to give his flock heavenly consolation in  earthly troubles. At last he remained alone. Then he broke off the mass  in the middle of a sentence, took the chalice, and ascended the steps  leading to the upper galleries. The Turks caught sight of him and rushed  after him like hungry hyaenas.    He is already up in the gallery. He is surrounded on all sides by  soldiers with drawn swords and lowered spears. Next moment he must fall  dead over the communion chalice. No escape, no rescue is possible.  Before him stands the grey stone wall.    But, lo! a door opens in the wall, and when the bishop has gone in the  wall closes up again. The soldiers stand still in astonishment. Then  they begin to attack the wall with spears and axes. But it is no use.  They renew their efforts, but still in vain.    Four centuries and a half have passed since then, and still the Greeks  cherish a blind faith that the day will come when St. Sophia will be  restored to Christian uses, when the wall will open again and the bishop  will walk out with the chalice in his hand. Calm and dignified he will  descend the stairs, cross the church, and mount up to the high altar to  continue the mass from the point where he was interrupted by the Turks.    Let us return to the savage soldiery. All the doors stand open, and the  midday sun shines in through the arched windows. The pillage and tumult  have reached their height when a fiery horse carries a rider up to the  main entrance. He is attended by Mohammedan princes, generals, and  pashas.[1] His name is Mohammed II., the Conqueror, the Sultan of the  Turks. He is young and proud and has a will of iron, but he is solemn  and melancholy. He dismounts and passes on foot over this floor, over  the marble slabs trodden a thousand years ago by the Emperor Justinian.    The first thing he sees is a janissary maliciously aiming his axe at the  marble pavement. The Sultan goes up to him and asks, \"Why?\" \"In the  cause of the faith,\" answers the soldier. Then the Sultan draws his  sabre, and, cutting the man down, exclaims, \"Dogs, have you not loot  enough? The buildings of the city are my property.\" And, kicking the  dying man aside, he ascends a Christian pulpit, and in a thundering  voice dedicates the Church of the Holy Wisdom to Islam.    Four and a half centuries have passed down the stream of time since the  day when the cross was removed and the crescent raised its horn above  the Church of the Holy Wisdom. The Turks have erected four minarets  round the dome, and every evening from the platforms of these minarets  sounds the voice of the muezzin, summoning the faithful to prayer. He  wears a white turban and a long mantle down to his feet. To all four  quarters of the city the call rings out with long, silvery _a_-sounds  and full, liquid _l_'s: \"God is great (four times repeated). I bear  witness that there is no god but God (twice repeated). I bear witness  that Mohammed is the Apostle of God (twice repeated). Come to prayers!  Come to prayers! Come to salvation! Come to salvation! God is great.  There is no god but God.\"    Now the sun sinks below the horizon, and a cannon shot thunders forth.  We are in the month of fasting, during which the Mohammedans do not eat,  drink, or smoke each day so long as the sun is up. Thus the Prophet  commands in the Koran, their holy book. The firing of the gun proclaims  the end of the fast for to-day, and when the faithful have refreshed  themselves with the smoking rissoles and rice puddings, or fruit,  coffee, and water-pipes which stand ready, they turn their steps to the  old Church of the Divine Wisdom, which still retains its Greek name.  Round the minarets thousands of lamps are lighted, and between the  towers the sacred names hang in flaming lights. Inside the mosque, on  chains fifty feet long, hang chandeliers, full of innumerable oil-lamps  in small round glass bowls, and on extended lines hang other lamps as  close as the beads of a rosary. The floor of the mosque is a sea of  light, but the interior of the dome is hid in gloom. Huge green shields  affixed to the columns bear in golden letters the names of Allah,  Mohammed and the saints, and the characters are thirty feet high.    The faithful have already filled the floor, which is covered with straw  matting. Shoes must be left outside on entering the mosque, and a man  must wash his arms, hands, and face before he goes in. Now the Turks  stand in long rows, white and green turbans and red fezes with black  tassels all mixed together. All turn their faces towards Mecca. All  hands go up together to the height of the face and are stretched out  flat, the thumbs touching the tip of the ear. Then they bend the body  forward, resting their hands on their knees. Next they fall on their  knees and touch the floor with their foreheads. \"Prayer is the key to  Paradise,\" says the Koran, and every section of the prayer requires a  certain posture.    A priest stands in a pulpit and breaks in on the solemn silence with his  clear musical voice. The last word dies away on his lips, but the echo  lingers long in the dome, hovering like a restless spirit among the  statues of the cherubim.    Among us at home there are people who are ashamed of going to church. A  Mohammedan may neglect his religious duties, but he always regards it as  an honour to fulfil them. When we come to Persia or Turkestan we shall  often see a caravan leader leave his camels in the middle of the march,  spread out his prayer-mat on the ground, and recite his prayers. They do  not do it thoughtlessly or slovenly: you might yell in the ear of a  Mohammedan at prayer and he would take no notice.    \"There is no god but God!\" The words sound like a trumpet-blast, as a  summons over boundless regions of the Old World. From its cradle in  Arabia, Islam has spread over all the west and centre of Asia, over the  southern parts of the continent, over certain regions in south-eastern  Europe, and over half Africa. It is no wonder that Mohammedan  missionaries find it easy to convert the blacks of Africa. Mohammed  promises them Paradise after death, and Paradise is only a continuation  of worldly pleasures--a place where the blessed dwell under palms which  continually bear fruit, where clear springs leap forth, and where flutes  and stringed instruments make music in eternal summer.      THE BAZAARS OF STAMBUL    As a child Fatima Hanum played in one of the narrow streets of Stambul.  When she was old enough, her parents betrothed and married her to Emin  Effendi, the son of an influential pasha. She knew little of him beyond  that he was rich and was considered a good match. His house was situated  in one of the larger streets of Scutari, and consisted of two wings  completely cut off from each other. In the one the husband had his  apartments, in the other lived the women. For Fatima is not alone; her  husband has three other wives, and all four have male and female slaves  who guard them strictly.    Poor Fatima is thus unfortunate from the first. She cannot live happily  with a man whose affection is not hers alone, and it is difficult for  her to live in peace with the three other women who have the same rights  as herself. Her life is empty and wearisome, and her days are passed in  idleness. For hours she stands behind the lattice in the oriel window  which projects over the street and watches the movement going on below.  When she is tired of this she goes in again. Her room is not large. In  the middle splashes a small fountain. Round the walls extend divans. She  sinks moodily on to one of them and calls a female slave, who brings a  small table, more like a stool. Fatima rolls a cigarette, and with  dreamy eyes watches the blue rings as they rise to the ceiling. Again  she calls the slave. A bowl of sweets is brought, she yawns, takes a bit  of sweetmeat, and throws herself on the soft cushions.    Then she drinks a glass of lemonade and crosses the room to a leather  trunk, which she unlocks. In the trunk lie her ornaments: bracelets of  gold, pearl necklaces, earrings of turquoise, and many cloths of  coloured silk. She puts a necklace round her neck, adorns her fingers  with rings, and winds thin silken veils round her head. When she is  ready she goes up to the mirror and admires her own beauty. She is  really handsome. Her skin is white and soft, her eyes are black, her  hair falls in dark waves over her shoulders. She is not pleased with the  colour of her lips. The slave brings out a small pot of porcelain and  with a pencil paints Fatima's lips redder than the coral which the Hindu  dealers sell in the bazaar. Then the eyebrows are not dark enough, so  they are blackened with Indian ink.    When Fatima is tired of examining her own features in the mirror she  puts back her ornaments into the chest and locks it securely. A  staircase leads down from her room to the garden. There she saunters for  a time, enjoying the perfume of roses and jasmine, and stands before the  cage of singing birds to amuse herself with them. One of the other wives  comes down to the harem garden and calls out to her: \"You are as ugly as  a monkey, Fatima; you are old and wrinkled and your eyes are red. Not a  man in all Stambul would care to look at you.\" Fatima answers: \"If"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#6)"],[1,"his bones, they meddled with his papers, and made general havoc. So,  in truth, he was not very willing to have Gertrude van Floote as a  permanent member of his household, and he said so.    But Koosje had taken a fancy to the girl; and having an eye to her own  departure at no very distant date,--for she had been betrothed more than  two years,--she pleaded so hard to keep her, promising to train her  in all the professor's ways, to teach her the value of old china and  osteologic specimens, that eventually, with a good deal of grumbling,  the old gentleman gave way, and, being a wise as well as an old  gentleman, went back to his studies, dismissing Koosje and the girl  alike from his thoughts.    Just at first Truide, poor child, was charmed.    She put away her splendid ornaments, and some lilac frocks and black  skirts were purchased for her. Her box, which she had left at the  station, supplied all that was necessary for Sunday.    It was great fun! For a whole week this young person danced about the  rambling old house, playing at being a servant. Then she began to grow  a little weary of it all. She had been accustomed, of course, to  performing such offices as all Dutch ladies fulfil--the care of china,  of linen, the dusting of rooms, and the like; but she had done them as  a mistress, not as an underling. And that was not the worst; it was when  it came to her pretty feet having to be thrust into klompen, and her  having to take a pail and syringe and mop and clean the windows and the  pathway and the front of the house, that the game of maid-servant began  to assume a very different aspect. When, after having been as free  as air to come and go as she chose, she was only permitted to attend  service on Sundays, and to take an hour's promenade with Dortje, who was  dull and heavy and stupid, she began to feel positively desperate; and  the result of it all was that when Jan van der Welde came, as he was  accustomed to do nearly every evening, to see Koosje, Miss Truide, from  sheer longing for excitement and change, began to make eyes at him, with  what effect I will endeavour to show.    Just at first Koosje noticed nothing. She herself was of so faithful a  nature that an idea, a suspicion, of Jan's faithlessness never entered  her mind. When the girl laughed and blushed and dimpled and smiled,  when she cast her great blue eyes at the big young fellow, Koosje only  thought how pretty she was, and it was just a thousand pities she had  not been born a great lady.    And thus weeks slipped over. Never very demonstrative herself, Koosje  saw nothing, Dortje, for her part, saw a great deal; but Dortje was a  woman of few words, one who quite believed in the saying, \"If speech is  silver, silence is gold;\" so she held her peace.    Now Truide, rendered fairly frantic by her enforced confinement to  the house, grew to look upon Jan as her only chance of excitement and  distraction; and Jan, poor, thick-headed noodle of six feet high, was  thoroughly wretched. What to do he knew not. A strange, mad, fierce  passion for Truide had taken possession of him, and an utter distaste,  almost dislike, had come in place of the old love for Koosje. Truide  was unlike anything he had ever come in contact with before; she was so  fairy-like, so light, so delicate, so dainty. Against Koosje's plumper,  maturer charms, she appeared to the infatuated young man like--if he had  ever heard of it he would probably have said like a Dresden china image;  but since he had not, he compared her in his own foolish heart to an  angel. Her feet were so tiny, her hands so soft, her eyes so expressive,  her waist so slim, her manner so bewitching! Somehow Koosje was  altogether different; he could not endure the touch of her heavy hand,  the tones of her less refined voice; he grew impatient at the denser  perceptions of her mind. It was very foolish, very short-sighted; for  the hands, though heavy, were clever and willing; the voice, though a  trifle coarser in accent than Truide's childish tones, would never tell  him a lie; the perceptions, though not brilliant, were the perceptions  of good, every-day common sense. It really was very foolish, for what  charmed him most in Truide was the merest outside polish, a certain ease  of manner which doubtless she had caught from the English aristocrats  whom she had known in her native place. She had not half the sterling  good qualities and steadfastness of Koosje; but Jan was in love, and  did not stop to argue the matter as you or I are able to do. Men in  love--very wise and great men, too--are often like Jan van der Welde.  They lay aside pro tem. the whole amount, be it great or small, of  wisdom they possess. And it must be remembered that Jan van der Welde  was neither a wise nor a great man.    Well, in the end there came what the French call _un denouement_,--what  we in forcible modern English would call a _smash_,--and it happened  thus. It was one evening toward the summer that Koosje's eyes were  suddenly opened, and she became aware of the free-and-easy familiarity  of Truide's manner toward her betrothed lover, Jan. It was some very  slight and trivial thing that led her to notice it, but in an instant  the whole truth flashed across her mind.    \"Leave the kitchen!\" she said, in a tone of authority.    But it happened that, at the very instant she spoke, Jan was furtively  holding Truide's fingers under the cover of the table-cloth; and when,  on hearing the sharp words, the girl would have snatched them away, he,  with true masculine instinct of opposition, held them fast.    \"What do you mean by speaking to her like that?\" he demanded, an angry  flush overspreading his dark face.    \"What is the maid to you?\" Koosje asked, indignantly.    \"Maybe more than you are,\" he retorted; in answer to which Koosje  deliberately marched out of the kitchen, leaving them alone.    To say she was indignant would be but very mildly to express the state  of her feelings; she was _furious_. She knew that the end of her romance  had come. No thoughts of making friends with Jan entered her mind; only  a great storm filled her heart till it was ready to burst with pain and  anguish.    As she went along the passage the professor's bell sounded, and Koosje,  being close to the door, went abruptly in. The professor looked up in  mild astonishment, quickly enough changed to dismay as he caught sight  of his valued Koosje's face, from out of which anger seemed in a moment  to have thrust all the bright, comely beauty.    \"How now, my good Koosje?\" said the old gentleman. \"Is aught amiss?\"    \"Yes, professor, there is,\" returned Koosje, all in a blaze of anger,  and moving, as she spoke, the tea-tray, which she set down upon the  oaken buffet with a bang, which made its fair and delicate freight  fairly jingle again.    \"But you needn't break my china, Koosje,\" suggested the old gentleman,  mildly, rising from his chair and getting into his favourite attitude  before the stove.    \"You are quite right, professor,\" returned Koosje, curtly; she was  sensible even in her trouble.    \"And what is the trouble?\" he asked, gently.    \"It's just this, professor,\" cried Koosje, setting her arms akimbo and  speaking in a high-pitched, shrill voice; \"you and I have been warming  a viper in our bosoms, and, viper-like, she has turned round and bitten  me.\"    \"Is it Truide?\"    \"Truide,\" she affirmed, disdainfully. \"Yes, it is Truide, who but for  me would be dead now of hunger and cold--or _worse_. And she has been  making love to that great fool, Jan van der Welde,--great oaf that he  is,--after all I have done for her; after my dragging her in out of the  cold and rain; after all I have taught her. Ah, professor, but it is a  vile, venomous viper that we have been warming in our bosoms!\"    \"I must beg, Koosje,\" said the old gentleman, sedately, \"that you will  exonerate me from any such proceeding. If you remember rightly, I was  altogether against your plan for keeping her in the house.\" He could not  resist giving her that little dig, kind of heart as he was.    \"Serves me right for being so soft-hearted!\" thundered Koosje. \"I'll be  wiser next time I fall over a bundle, and leave it where I find it.\"    \"No, no, Koosje; don't say that,\" the old gentleman remonstrated,  gently. \"After all, it may be but a blessing in disguise. God sends all  our trials for some good and wise purpose. Our heaviest afflictions are  often, nay, most times, Koosje, means to some great end which, while the  cloud of adversity hangs over us, we are unable to discern.\"    \"Ah!\" sniffed Koosje, scornfully.    \"This oaf--as I must say you justly term him, for you are a good clever  woman, Koosje, as I can testify after the experience of years--has  proved that he can be false; he has shown that he can throw away  substance for shadow (for, of a truth, that poor, pretty child would  make a sad wife for a poor man); yet it is better you should know it now  than at some future date, when--when there might be other ties to make  the knowledge more bitter to you.\"    \"Yes, that is true,\" said Koosje, passing the back of her hand across  her trembling lips. She could not shed tears over her trouble; her eyes  were dry and burning, as if anger had scorched the blessed drops up ere  they should fall. She went on washing up the cups and saucers, or at  least _the_ cup and saucer, and other articles the professor had used  for his tea; and after a few minutes' silence he spoke again.    \"What are you going to do? Punish her, or turn her out, or what?\"    \"I shall let him--_marry_ her,\" replied Koosje, with a portentous nod.    The old gentleman couldn't help laughing. \"You think he will pay off  your old scores?\"    \"Before long,\" answered Koosje, grimly, \"she will find him out--as I  have done.\"    Then, having finished washing the tea-things, which the professor had  shuddered to behold in her angry hands, she whirled"]]]
