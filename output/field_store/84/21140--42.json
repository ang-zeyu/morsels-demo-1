The wish of the genuine painter must be more extensive: instead of  endeavouring to amuse mankind with the minute neatness of his imitations,  he must endeavour to improve them by the grandeur of his ideas; instead  of seeking praise, by deceiving the superficial sense of the spectator,  he must strive for fame, by captivating the imagination.    The principle now laid down, that the perfection of this art does not  consist in mere imitation, is far from being new or singular.  It is,  indeed, supported by the general opinion of the enlightened part of  mankind.  The poets, orators, and rhetoricians of antiquity, are  continually enforcing this position, that all the arts receive their  perfection from an ideal beauty, superior to what is to be found in  individual nature.  They are ever referring to the practice of the  painters and sculptors of their times, particularly Phidias (the  favourite artist of antiquity), to illustrate their assertions.  As if  they could not sufficiently express their admiration of his genius by  what they knew, they have recourse to poetical enthusiasm.  They call it  inspiration; a gift from heaven.  The artist is supposed to have ascended  the celestial regions, to furnish his mind with this perfect idea of  beauty.  \"He,\" says Proclus, \"who takes for his model such forms as  nature produces, and confines himself to an exact imitation of them, will  never attain to what is perfectly beautiful.  For the works of nature are  full of disproportion, and fall very short of the true standard of  beauty.  So that Phidias, when he formed his Jupiter, did not copy any  object ever presents to his sight; but contemplated only that image which  he had conceived in his mind from Homer's description.\"  And thus Cicero,  speaking of the same Phidias: \"Neither did this artist,\" says he, \"when  he carved the image of Jupiter or Minerva, set before him any one human  figure as a pattern, which he was to copy; but having a more perfect idea  of beauty fixed in his mind, this he steadily contemplated, and to the  imitation of this all his skill and labour were directed.\"    The moderns are not less convinced than the ancients of this superior  power existing in the art; nor less conscious of its effects.  Every  language has adopted terms expressive of this excellence.  The _Gusto  grande_ of the Italians; the _Beau ideal_ of the French and the _great  style_, _genius_, and _taste_ among the English, are but different  appellations of the same thing.  It is this intellectual dignity, they  say, that ennobles the painter's art; that lays the line between him and  the mere mechanic; and produces those great effects in an instant, which  eloquence and poetry, by slow and repeated efforts, are scarcely able to  attain.    Such is the warmth with which both the ancients and moderns speak of this  divine principle of the art; but, as I have formerly observed,  enthusiastic admiration seldom promotes knowledge.  Though a student by  such praise may have his attention roused, and a desire excited, of  running in this great career, yet it is possible that what has been said  to excite, may only serve to deter him.  He examines his own mind, and  perceives there nothing of that divine inspiration with which he is told  so many others have been favoured.  He never travelled to heaven to  gather new ideas; and he finds himself possessed of no other  qualifications than what mere common observation and a plain  understanding can confer.  Thus he becomes gloomy amidst the splendour of  figurative declamation, and thinks it hopeless to pursue an object which  he supposes out of the reach of human industry.    But on this, as upon many other occasions, we ought to distinguish how  much is to be given to enthusiasm, and how much to reason.  We ought to  allow for, and we ought to commend, that strength of vivid expression  which is necessary to convey, in its full force, the highest sense of the  most complete effect of art; taking care at the same time not to lose in  terms of vague admiration that solidity and truth of principle upon which  alone we can reason, and may be enabled to practise.    It is not easy to define in what this great style consists; nor to  describe, by words, the proper means of acquiring it, if the mind of the  student should be at all capable of such an acquisition.  Could we teach  taste or genius by rules, they would be no longer taste and genius.  But  though there neither are, nor can be, any precise invariable rules for  the exercise or the acquisition of those great qualities, yet we may as  truly say that they always operate in proportion to our attention in  observing the works of nature, to our skill in selecting, and to our care  in digesting, methodising, and comparing our observations.  There are  many beauties in our art, that seem, at first, to lie without the reach  of precept, and yet may easily be reduced to practical principles.  Experience is all in all; but it is not every one who profits by  experience; and most people err, not so much from want of capacity to  find their object, as from not knowing what object to pursue.  This great  ideal perfection and beauty are not to be sought in the heavens, but upon  the earth.  They are about us, and upon every side of us.  But the power  of discovering what is deformed in nature, or in other words, what is  particular and uncommon, can be acquired only by experience; and the  whole beauty and grandeur of the art consists, in my opinion, in being  able to get above all singular forms, local customs, particularities, and  details of every kind.    All the objects which are exhibited to our view by nature, upon close  examination will be found to have their blemishes and defects.  The most  beautiful forms have something about them like weakness, minuteness, or  imperfection.  But it is not every eye that perceives these blemishes.  It  must be an eye long used to the contemplation and comparison of these  forms; and which, by a long habit of observing what any set of objects of  the same kind have in common, that alone can acquire the power of  discerning what each wants in particular.  This long laborious comparison  should be the first study of the painter who aims at the greatest style.  By this means, he acquires a just idea of beautiful forms; he corrects  nature by herself, her imperfect state by her more perfect.  His eye  being enabled to distinguish the accidental deficiencies, excrescences,  and deformities of things from their general figures, he makes out an  abstract idea of their forms more perfect than any one original; and what  may seem a paradox, he learns to design naturally by drawing his figures  unlike to any one object.  This idea of the perfect state of nature,  which the artist calls the ideal beauty, is the great leading principle  by which works of genius are conducted.  By this Phidias acquired his  fame.  He wrought upon a sober principle what has so much excited the  enthusiasm of the world; and by this method you, who have courage to  tread the same path, may acquire equal reputation.    This is the idea which has acquired, and which seems to have a right to  the epithet of Divine; as it may be said to preside, like a supreme  judge, over all the productions of nature; appearing to be possessed of  the will and intention of the Creator, as far as they regard the external  form of living beings.    When a man once possesses this idea in its perfection, there is no danger  but that he will he sufficiently warmed by it himself, and be able to  warm and ravish every one else.    Thus it is from a reiterated experience, and a close comparison of the  objects in nature, that an artist becomes possessed of the idea of that  central form, if I may so express it, from which every deviation is  deformity.  But the investigation of this form I grant is painful, and I  know but of one method of shortening the road; this is, by a careful  study of the works of the ancient sculptors; who, being indefatigable in  the school of nature, have left models of that perfect form behind them,  which an artist would prefer as supremely beautiful, who had spent his  whole life in that single contemplation.  But if industry carried them  thus far, may not you also hope for the same reward from the same labour?  We have the same school opened to us that was opened to them; for nature  denies her instructions to none who desire to become her pupils.    To the principle I have laid down, that the idea of beauty in each  species of beings is invariably one, it may be objected that in every  particular species there are various central forms, which are separate  and distinct from each other, and yet are undeniably beautiful; that in  the human figure, for instance, the beauty of the Hercules is one, of the  gladiator another, of the Apollo another, which makes so many different  ideas of beauty.    It is true, indeed, that these figures are each perfect in their kind,  though of different characters and proportions; but still none of them is  the representation of an individual, but of a class.  And as there is one  general form, which, as I have said, belongs to the human kind at large,  so in each of these classes there is one common idea and central form,  which is the abstract of the various individual forms belonging to that  class.  Thus, though the forms of childhood and age differ exceedingly,  there is a common form in childhood, and a common form in age,--which is  the more perfect, as it is more remote from all peculiarities.  But I  must add further, that though the most perfect forms of each of the  general divisions of the human figure are ideal, and superior to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#6)"],[1,"ventricle than the left.      Section 45. The following are the chief branches of the aorta. The  student should be able to follow them with certainty in dissection;  they are all displayed in the Figure; but it must not be imagined for a  moment that familiarity with this diagram will obviate the necessity  for the practical work; (in.) is the innominate artery; it forks into  (s.cl.a.) the right subclavian, and (r.c.c.) the right common carotid.  Each carotid splits at the angle of the jaw into an internal and an  external branch. The left common carotid, (l.c.c.) arises from the  base of the innominate,* (l.s.cl.a.) the left subclavian, directly from  the aorta. The aorta now curves round to the dorsal middle line, and  runs down as seen in Figure 1, Sheet 1 (d.ao.) and Figure 1, Sheet  2 (d.ao.). Small branches are given off to the ribs, and then comes  the median coeliac (coe.a.) to the stomach and spleen, the median  superior mesenteric (s.mes.a.) to the main portion of the intestine,  and the inferior mesenteric (p.m.a.) to the rectum. Note that no veins  to the inferior vena cava correspond to these arteries-- the blood they  supply going back by the portal vein (p.v.). The paired renal arteries  (r.a.) supply the kidneys, and the common iliacs (c.il.a.) the hind  legs, splitting into the internal iliacs (i.il.a.) and the femoral (f.).       {Lines from Second Edition only.}     [The student should note that the only arteries in the middle line     are those supplying the alimentary canal.]       {Lines from First Edition only.}     * -The figure is inaccurate, and represents the left common carotid     as arising from the aortic arch.-      Section 46. The distribution of the veins of the rabbit has only a  superficial parallelism with arteries. The chief factors of vena cava  inferior are the hepatic vein (h.v.), which receives the liver blood,  the renal veins (r.v.), from the kidneys, the ilaeo-lumbar, from the  abdominal wall, and the external (e.il.v.) and internal ilias (i.il.v.);  with the exception of the renal veins none of these run side by side  with arteries. The superior cavae (r. and l.v.c.s.) are formed by the  union of internal (i.j.) and external jugular (e.j.) veins with a  subclavian (s.cl.v.) from the fore limb. The term pre-caval vein is  sometimes used for superior cava. The attention, of the student is called  to the small azygos vein (az.) running into the right vena cava superior,  and forming the only asymmetrical (not-balancing) feature of the veins  in front of the heart; it brings blood back from the ribs of the thorax  wall, and is of interest mainly because it answers to an enormous  main vessel, the right post-cardinal sinus, in fishes. There are  spermatic arteries and veins (s.v. and a.) to the genital organs. All  these vessels should be patiently dissected out by the student, and  drawn.      Section 47. Between the final branches of the arteries and the first  fine factors of the veins, and joining them, come the systemic  capillaries. These smallest and ultimate ramifications of the  circulation penetrate every living part of the animal, so that if we  could isolate the vascular system we should have the complete form  of the rabbit in a closely-meshed network. It is in the capillaries that  the exchange of gases occurs and that nutritive material passes out  to the tissues and katastases in from them; they are the essential  factor in the circulatory system of the mammal-- veins, arteries, and  heart simply exist to remove and replace their contents. The details of  the branching of the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins need  not detain us now.      Section 48. Summarising the course of the circulation, starting from  the right ventricle, we have-- pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillaries,  pulmonary vein, left auricle, left ventricle, aorta, arteries, and systemic  capillaries. After this, from all parts except the spleen and alimentary  canal, the blood returns to systemic veins, superior or inferior cavae,  right auricle, and right ventricle. The blood from the stomach spleen,  and intestines however, passes via {through} the portal vein to the liver  capillaries and then through the hepatic vein to inferior cava, and so  on. Material leaves the blood to be excreted in lungs, kidneys, by the  skin (as perspiration), and elsewhere. New material enters most  conspicuously;       (a) by the portal veins portal veins and       (b) by the thoracic duct and left superior cava.      Section 49.

Cells, and Tissue_    Section 50. We have thus seen how the nutritive material is taken into  the animal's system and distributed over its body, and incidentally, we  have noted how the resultant products of the creature's activity are  removed. The essence of the whole process, as we have already  stated, is the decomposition and partial oxydation of certain complex  chemical compounds to water, carbon dioxide, a low nitrogenous  body, which finally takes the form of urea, and other substances. We  may now go on to a more detailed study, the microscopic study, or  histology, of the tissues in which metaboly and kataboly occur, but  before we do this it will be convenient to glance for a moment at  another of our animal types-- the Amoeba, the lowest as the rabbit is  the highest, in our series.      Section 51. This is shown in Figure III., Sheet 3, as it would appear  under the low power of the microscope. We have a mass of a clear,  transparent, greyish substance called protoplasm, granular in  places, and with a clearer border; within this is a denser portion called  the nucleus, or endoplast (n.), which, under the microscope, by  transmitted light, appear brighter, and within that a still denser spot,  the nucleolus (ns.) or endoplastule. The protoplasm is more or less  extensively excavated by fluid spaces, vacuoles; one clearer circular  space or vacuole, which is invariably present, appears at intervals,  enlarges gradually, and then vanishes abruptly, to reappear after a  brief interval; this is called the contractile vacuole (c.v.). The  amoeba is constantly changing its shape, whence its older name of  the Proteus animalcule, thrusting out masses of its substance in  one direction, and withdrawing from another, and hence slowly  creeping about. These thrust-out parts, in its outline, are called  pseudopodia (ps.). By means of them it gradually creeps round and  encloses its food. Little particles of nutritive matter are usually to be  detected in the homogeneous protoplasm of its body; commonly  these are surrounded by a drop of water taken in with them, and the  drop of water is then called a food vacuole. The process of taking in  food is called ingestion. The amoeba, in all probability, performs  essentially the same chemical process as we have summarised in  Sections 10, 11, 12; it ingests food, digests it in the food vacuoles  and builds it up into its body protoplasm, to undergo kataboly and  furnish the force of its motion-- the contractile vacuole, is probably  respiratory and perhaps excretory, accumulating and then, by its  \"systole\" (compare Section 44), forcing out of its body, the water,  carbon dioxide, urea, and other katastases, which are formed  concomitantly with its activity. The amoeba reproduces itself in the  simplest way; the nucleus occasionally divides into two portions and  a widening fissure in the protoplasm of the animal's body separates  one from the other. It is impossible to say that one is the parent cell,  and the other the offspring; the amoeba we merely perceive, was one  and is now two. It is curious to note, therefore, that the amoeba is,  in a sense, immortal-- that the living nucleus of one of these minute  creatures that we examine to-day under a microscope may have  conceivably drawn, out an unbroken thread of life since the remotest  epochs of the world's history. Although no sexual intercourse can be  observed, there is reason to believe that a process of supposed  \"cannabalism,\" in which a larger amoeba may occasionally engulph  a smaller one, is really a conjugative reproductive process, and  followed by increased vitality and division.      Section 52. Now if the student will compare Section 35, he will see  that in the white blood corpuscles we have a very remarkable  resemblance to the amoeba; the contractile vacuole is absent, but we  have the protoplasmic body, the nucleus and nucleolus, and those  creeping fluctuations of shape through the thrusting out and  withdrawal of pseudopodia, which constitute \"amoeboid\" motion. They  also multiply, in the same way, by division.      Section 53. It is not only in the white corpuscle of the blood that we  find this resemblance; in all the firmer parts of the body we find, on  microscopic examination, similar little blebs of protoplasm, and at an  early stage of development the young"]]]
