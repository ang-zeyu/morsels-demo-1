Has her sorrow come  on her already?\" He slipped it into his own waistcoat pocket. \"I think  I'm justified,\" he said, \"till I know a little more.\"    He gazed painfully at the girl, at that moment being raised out of the  flowers by Muscari, who was saying: \"We have fallen into heaven; it is  a sign. Mortals climb up and they fall down; but it is only gods and  goddesses who can fall upwards.\"    And indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and happy  a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted. \"After  all,\" he thought, \"perhaps the poison isn't hers; perhaps it's one of  Muscari's melodramatic tricks.\"    Muscari set the lady lightly on her feet, made her an absurdly  theatrical bow, and then, drawing his cutlass, hacked hard at the taut  reins of the horses, so that they scrambled to their feet and stood  in the grass trembling. When he had done so, a most remarkable thing  occurred. A very quiet man, very poorly dressed and extremely sunburnt,  came out of the bushes and took hold of the horses' heads. He had a  queer-shaped knife, very broad and crooked, buckled on his belt; there  was nothing else remarkable about him, except his sudden and silent  appearance. The poet asked him who he was, and he did not answer.    Looking around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow,  Muscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man, with a  short gun under his arm, was looking at them from the ledge just below,  leaning his elbows on the edge of the turf. Then he looked up at the  road from which they had fallen and saw, looking down on them, the  muzzles of four other carbines and four other brown faces with bright  but quite motionless eyes.    \"The brigands!\" cried Muscari, with a kind of monstrous gaiety. \"This  was a trap. Ezza, if you will oblige me by shooting the coachman first,  we can cut our way out yet. There are only six of them.\"    \"The coachman,\" said Ezza, who was standing grimly with his hands in his  pockets, \"happens to be a servant of Mr Harrogate's.\"    \"Then shoot him all the more,\" cried the poet impatiently; \"he was  bribed to upset his master. Then put the lady in the middle, and we will  break the line up there--with a rush.\"    And, wading in wild grass and flowers, he advanced fearlessly on the  four carbines; but finding that no one followed except young Harrogate,  he turned, brandishing his cutlass to wave the others on. He beheld  the courier still standing slightly astride in the centre of the grassy  ring, his hands in his pockets; and his lean, ironical Italian face  seemed to grow longer and longer in the evening light.    \"You thought, Muscari, I was the failure among our schoolfellows,\" he  said, \"and you thought you were the success. But I have succeeded more  than you and fill a bigger place in history. I have been acting epics  while you have been writing them.\"    \"Come on, I tell you!\" thundered Muscari from above. \"Will you stand  there talking nonsense about yourself with a woman to save and three  strong men to help you? What do you call yourself?\"    \"I call myself Montano,\" cried the strange courier in a voice equally  loud and full. \"I am the King of Thieves, and I welcome you all to my  summer palace.\"    And even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready came out of  the bushes, and looked towards him for their orders. One of them held a  large paper in his hand.    \"This pretty little nest where we are all picnicking,\" went on the  courier-brigand, with the same easy yet sinister smile, \"is, together  with some caves underneath it, known by the name of the Paradise of  Thieves. It is my principal stronghold on these hills; for (as you have  doubtless noticed) the eyrie is invisible both from the road above and  from the valley below. It is something better than impregnable; it is  unnoticeable. Here I mostly live, and here I shall certainly die, if  the gendarmes ever track me here. I am not the kind of criminal that  'reserves his defence,' but the better kind that reserves his last  bullet.\"    All were staring at him thunderstruck and still, except Father Brown,  who heaved a huge sigh as of relief and fingered the little phial in his  pocket. \"Thank God!\" he muttered; \"that's much more probable. The poison  belongs to this robber-chief, of course. He carries it so that he may  never be captured, like Cato.\"    The King of Thieves was, however, continuing his address with the same  kind of dangerous politeness. \"It only remains for me,\" he said,  \"to explain to my guests the social conditions upon which I have the  pleasure of entertaining them. I need not expound the quaint old ritual  of ransom, which it is incumbent upon me to keep up; and even this only  applies to a part of the company. The Reverend Father Brown and the  celebrated Signor Muscari I shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort  to my outposts. Poets and priests, if you will pardon my simplicity  of speech, never have any money. And so (since it is impossible to  get anything out of them), let us, seize the opportunity to show our  admiration for classic literature and our reverence for Holy Church.\"    He paused with an unpleasing smile; and Father Brown blinked repeatedly  at him, and seemed suddenly to be listening with great attention. The  brigand captain took the large paper from the attendant brigand and,  glancing over it, continued: \"My other intentions are clearly set forth  in this public document, which I will hand round in a moment; and which  after that will be posted on a tree by every village in the valley, and  every cross-road in the hills. I will not weary you with the verbalism,  since you will be able to check it; the substance of my proclamation is  this: I announce first that I have captured the English millionaire, the  colossus of finance, Mr Samuel Harrogate. I next announce that I have  found on his person notes and bonds for two thousand pounds, which he  has given up to me. Now since it would be really immoral to announce  such a thing to a credulous public if it had not occurred, I suggest it  should occur without further delay. I suggest that Mr Harrogate senior  should now give me the two thousand pounds in his pocket.\"    The banker looked at him under lowering brows, red-faced and sulky, but  seemingly cowed. That leap from the failing carriage seemed to have used  up his last virility. He had held back in a hang-dog style when his son  and Muscari had made a bold movement to break out of the brigand  trap. And now his red and trembling hand went reluctantly to his  breast-pocket, and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes to the  brigand.    \"Excellent!\" cried that outlaw gaily; \"so far we are all cosy. I resume  the points of my proclamation, so soon to be published to all Italy.  The third item is that of ransom. I am asking from the friends of the  Harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds, which I am sure  is almost insulting to that family in its moderate estimate of their  importance. Who would not pay triple this sum for another day's  association with such a domestic circle? I will not conceal from you  that the document ends with certain legal phrases about the unpleasant  things that may happen if the money is not paid; but meanwhile, ladies  and gentlemen, let me assure you that I am comfortably off here  for accommodation, wine and cigars, and bid you for the present a  sportsman-like welcome to the luxuries of the Paradise of Thieves.\"    All the time that he had been speaking, the dubious-looking men with  carbines and dirty slouch hats had been gathering silently in such  preponderating numbers that even Muscari was compelled to recognize his  sally with the sword as hopeless. He glanced around him; but the girl  had already gone over to soothe and comfort her father, for her natural  affection for his person was as strong or stronger than her somewhat  snobbish pride in his success. Muscari, with the illogicality of a  lover, admired this filial devotion, and yet was irritated by it.  He slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself  somewhat sulkily on one of the green banks. The priest sat down within  a yard or two, and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him in an  instantaneous irritation.    \"Well,\" said the poet tartly, \"do people still think me too romantic?  Are there, I wonder, any brigands left in the mountains?\"    \"There may be,\" said Father Brown agnostically.    \"What do you mean?\" asked the other sharply.    \"I mean I am puzzled,\" replied the priest. \"I am puzzled about Ezza or  Montano, or whatever his name is. He seems to me much more inexplicable  as a brigand even than he was as a courier.\"    \"But in what way?\" persisted his companion. \"Santa Maria! I should have  thought the brigand was plain enough.\"    \"I find three curious difficulties,\" said the priest in a quiet voice.  \"I should like to have your opinion on them. First of all I must tell  you I was lunching in that restaurant at the seaside. As four of you  left the room, you and Miss Harrogate went ahead, talking and laughing;  the banker and the courier came behind, speaking sparely and rather low.  But I could not help hearing Ezza say these words--'Well, let her have  a little fun; you know the blow may smash her any minute.' Mr Harrogate  answered nothing; so the words must have had some meaning. On the  impulse of the moment I warned her brother that she might be in peril;  I said nothing of its nature, for I did not know. But if it meant  this capture in the hills, the thing is nonsense. Why should the  brigand-courier warn his patron, even by a hint, when it was his whole  purpose to lure him into the mountain-mousetrap? It could not have  meant that.

While it was chiefly in expeditions against the buccaneers, or in the  defence of merchantmen against these predatory gentry, that the  American colonists gained their experience in naval warfare, there  were, nevertheless, some few naval expeditions fitted out by the  colonists against the forces of a hostile government. Both to the  north and south lay the territory of France and Spain,--England's  traditional enemies; and so soon as the colonies began to give  evidence of their value to the mother country, so soon were they  dragged into the quarrels in which the haughty mistress of the seas  was ever plunged. Of the southern colonies, South Carolina was  continually embroiled with Spain, owing to the conviction of the  Spanish that the boundaries of Florida--at that time a Spanish  colony--included the greater part of the Carolinas. For the purpose of  enforcing this idea, the Spaniards, in 1706, fitted out an expedition  of four ships-of-war and a galley, which, under the command of a  celebrated French admiral, was despatched to take Charleston. The  people of Charleston were in no whit daunted, and on the receipt of  the news of the expedition began preparations for resistance. They had  no naval vessels; but several large merchantmen, being in port, were  hastily provided with batteries, and a large galley was converted into  a flag-ship. Having no trained naval officers, the command of the  improvised squadron was tendered to a certain Lieut.-Col. Rhett, who  possessed the confidence of the colonists. Rhett accepted the command;  and when the attacking party cast anchor some miles below the city,  and landed their shore forces, he weighed anchor, and set out to  attack them. But the Spaniards avoided the conflict, and fled out to  sea, leaving their land forces to bear the brunt of battle. In this  action, more than half of the invaders were killed or taken prisoners.  Some days later, one of the Spanish vessels, having been separated  from her consorts, was discovered by Rhett, who attacked her, and  after a sharp fight captured her, bringing her with ninety prisoners  to Charleston.    But it was chiefly in expeditions against the French colonies to the  northward that the naval strength of the English colonies was exerted.  Particularly were the colonies of Port Royal, in Acadia, and the  French stronghold of Quebec coveted by the British, and they proved  fertile sources of contention in the opening years of the eighteenth  century. Although the movement for the capture of these colonies was  incited by the ruling authorities of Great Britain, its execution was  left largely to the colonists. One of the earliest of these  expeditions was that which sailed from Nantasket, near Boston, in  April, 1690, bound for the conquest of Port Royal.    This expedition was under the command of Sir William Phipps, a sturdy  colonist, whose life was not devoid of romantic episodes. Though his  ambitions were of the lowliest,--his dearest wish being \"to command a  king's ship, and own a fair brick house in the Green Lane of North  Boston,\"--he managed to win for himself no small amount of fame and  respect in the colonies. His first achievement was characteristic of  that time, when Spanish galleons, freighted with golden ingots, still  sailed the seas, when pirates buried their booty, and when the  treasures carried down in sunken ships were not brought up the next  day by divers clad in patented submarine armor. From a weather-beaten  old seaman, with whom he became acquainted while pursuing his trade  of ship-carpentering Phipps learned of a sunken wreck lying on the  sandy bottom many fathoms beneath the blue surface of the Gulf of  Mexico. The vessel had gone down fifty years before, and had carried  with her great store of gold and silver, which she was carrying from  the rich mines of Central and South America to the Court of Spain.  Phipps, laboriously toiling with adze and saw in his ship-yard,  listened to the story of the sailor, his blood coursing quicker in his  veins, and his ambition for wealth and position aroused to its fullest  extent. Here, then, thought he, was the opportunity of a lifetime.  Could he but recover the treasures carried down with the sunken ship,  he would have wealth and position in the colony. With these two allies  at his command, the task of securing a command in the king's navy  would be an easy one. But to seek out the sunken treasure required a  ship and seamen. Clearly his own slender means could never meet the  demands of so great an undertaking. Therefore, gathering together all  his small savings, William Phipps set sail for England, in the hopes  of interesting capitalists there in his scheme. By dint of indomitable  persistence, the unknown American ship-carpenter managed to secure the  influence of certain officials of high station in England, and finally  managed to get the assistance of the British admiralty. A frigate,  fully manned, was given him, and he set sail for the West Indies.    Once arrived in the waters of the Spanish Main, he began his search.  Cruising about the spot indicated by his seafaring informant as the  location of the sunken vessel, sounding and dredging occupied the time  of the treasure-seekers for months. The crew, wearying of the  fruitless search, began to murmur, and signs of mutiny were rife.  Phipps, filled with thoughts of the treasure for which he sought, saw  not at all the lowering looks, nor heard the half-uttered threats, of  the crew as he passed them. But finally the mutiny so developed that  he could no longer ignore its existence.    It was then the era of the buccaneers. Doubtless some of the crew had  visited the outlaws' rendezvous at New Providence, and had told their  comrades of the revelry and ease in which the sea robbers spent their  days. And so it happened that one day, as Phipps stood on the  quarter-deck vainly trying to choke down the nameless fear that had  begun to oppress him,--the fear that his life's venture had proved a  failure,--his crew came crowding aft, armed to the teeth, and loudly  demanded that the captain should abandon his foolish search, and lead  them on a fearless buccaneering cruise along the Spanish Main. The  mutiny was one which might well have dismayed the boldest sea captain.  The men were desperate, and well armed. Phipps was almost without  support; for his officers, by their irresolute and timid demeanor,  gave him little assurance of aid.    Standing on the quarter-deck, Phipps listened impatiently to the  complaints of the mutineers; but, when their spokesman called upon him  to lead them upon a piratical cruise, he lost all control of himself,  and, throwing all prudence to the winds, sprung into the midst of the  malcontents, and laid about him right manfully with his bare fists.  The mutineers were all well armed, but seemed loath to use their  weapons; and the captain, a tall, powerful man, soon awed them all  into submission.    Though he showed indomitable energy in overcoming obstacles, Phipps  was not destined to discover the object of his search at this time;  and, after several months' cruising, he was forced, by the leaky  condition of his vessel, to abandon the search. But, before leaving  the waters of the Spanish Main, he obtained enough information to  convince him that his plan was a practicable one, and no mere  visionary scheme. On reaching England, he went at once to some wealthy  noblemen, and, laying before them all the facts in his possession, so  interested them in the project that they readily agreed to supply him  with a fresh outfit. After a few weeks spent in organizing his  expedition, the treasure-seeker was again on the ocean, making his way  toward the Mexican Gulf. This time his search was successful, and a  few days' work with divers and dredges about the sunken ship brought  to light bullion and specie to the amount of more than a million and a  half dollars. As his ill success in the first expedition had embroiled  him with his crew, so his good fortune this time aroused the cupidity  of the sailors. Vague rumors of plotting against his life reached the  ears of Phipps. Examining further into the matter, he learned that the  crew was plotting to seize the vessel, divide the treasure, and set  out upon a buccaneering cruise. Alarmed at this intelligence, Phipps  strove to conciliate the seamen by offering them a share of the  treasure. Each man should receive a portion, he promised, even if he  himself had to pay it. The men agreed to this proposition; and so  well did Phipps keep his word with them on returning to England, that,  of the whole treasure, only about eighty thousand dollars remained to  him as his share. This, however, was an ample fortune for those times;  and with it Phipps returned to Boston, and began to devote himself to  the task of securing a command in the royal navy.    His first opportunity to distinguish himself came in the expedition of  1690 against Port Royal. Throughout the wars between France and  England, the French settlement of Port Royal had been a thorn in the  flesh of Massachusetts. From Port Royal, the trim-built speedy French  privateers put to sea, and seldom returned without bringing in their  wake some captured coaster or luckless fisherman hailing from the  colony of the Puritans. When the depredations of the privateers became  unbearable, Massachusetts bestirred herself, and the doughty Phipps  was sent with an expedition to reduce their unneighborly neighbor to  subjection. Seven vessels and two hundred and eighty-eight men were  put under the command of the lucky treasure-hunter. The expedition was  devoid of exciting or novel features. Port Royal was reached without  disaster, and the governor surrendered with a promptitude which should  have won immunity for the people of the village. But the"]]]
