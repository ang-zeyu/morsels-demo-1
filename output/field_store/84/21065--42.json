[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2042"],[0,"Something New (#6)"],[1,"such large mouthfuls, Adams?\"    Adams refrained from expressing an opinion, but inwardly he was  thrilling with artistic fervor. Mr. Simmonds eating, was one of  his best imitations, though Mrs. Adams was inclined to object to  it on the score that it was a bad example for the children. To be  privileged to witness Lord Emsworth watching and criticizing Mr.  Simmonds was to collect material for a double-barreled character  study that would assuredly make the hit of the evening.    \"That man,\" went on Lord Emsworth, \"is digging his grave with his  teeth. Digging his grave with his teeth, Adams! Do you take large  mouthfuls, Adams?\"    \"No, your lordship.\"    \"Quite right. Very sensible of you, Adams--very sensible of you.  Very sen---- What was I saying, Adams?\"    \"About my not taking large mouthfuls, your lordship.\"    \"Quite right--quite right! Never take large mouthfuls, Adams.  Never gobble. Have you any children, Adams?\"    \"Two, your lordship.\"    \"I hope you teach them not to gobble. They pay for it in later  life. Americans gobble when young and ruin their digestions. My  American friend, Mr. Peters, suffers terribly from indigestion.\"    Adams lowered his voice to a confidential murmur: \"If you will  pardon the liberty, your lordship--I saw it in the paper--\"    \"About Mr. Peters' indigestion?\"    \"About Miss Peters, your lordship, and the Honorable Frederick.  May I be permitted to offer my congratulations?\"    \"Eh, Oh, yes--the engagement. Yes, yes, yes! Yes--to be sure.  Yes; very satisfactory in every respect. High time he settled  down and got a little sense. I put it to him straight. I cut off  his allowance and made him stay at home. That made him  think--lazy young devil!\"    Lord Emsworth had his lucid moments; and in the one that occurred  now it came home to him that he was not talking to himself, as he  had imagined, but confiding intimate family secrets to the head  steward of his club's dining-room. He checked himself abruptly,  and with a slight decrease of amiability fixed his gaze on the  bill of fare and ordered cold beef. For an instant he felt  resentful against Adams for luring him on to soliloquize; but the  next moment his whole mind was gripped by the fascinating  spectacle of Mr. Simmonds dealing with a wedge of Stilton cheese,  and Adams was forgotten.    The cold beef had the effect of restoring his lordship to  complete amiability, and when Adams in the course of his  wanderings again found himself at the table he was once more  disposed for light conversation.    \"So you saw the news of the engagement in the paper, did you,  Adams?\"    \"Yes, your lordship, in the Mail. It had quite a long piece about  it. And the Honorable Frederick's photograph and the young lady's  were in the Mirror. Mrs. Adams clipped them out and put them in  an album, knowing that your lordship was a member of ours. If I  may say so, your lordship--a beautiful young lady.\"    \"Devilish attractive, Adams--and devilish rich. Mr. Peters is a  millionaire, Adams.\"    \"So I read in the paper, your lordship.\"    \"Damme! They all seem to be millionaires in America. Wish I knew  how they managed it. Honestly, I hope. Mr. Peters is an honest  man, but his digestion is bad. He used to bolt his food. You  don't bolt your food, I hope, Adams?\"    \"No, your lordship; I am most careful.\"    \"The late Mr. Gladstone used to chew each mouthful thirty-three  times. Deuced good notion if you aren't in a hurry. What cheese  would you recommend, Adams?\"    \"The gentlemen are speaking well of the Gorgonzola.\"    \"All right, bring me some. You know, Adams, what I admire about  Americans is their resource. Mr. Peters tells me that as a boy of  eleven he earned twenty dollars a week selling mint to saloon  keepers, as they call publicans over there. Why they wanted mint  I cannot recollect. Mr. Peters explained the reason to me and it  seemed highly plausible at the time; but I have forgotten it.  Possibly for mint sauce. It impressed me, Adams. Twenty dollars  is four pounds. I never earned four pounds a week when I was a  boy of eleven; in fact, I don't think I ever earned four pounds a  week. His story impressed me, Adams. Every man ought to have an  earning capacity. I was so struck with what he told me that I  began to paint.\"    \"Landscapes, your lordship?\"    \"Furniture. It is unlikely that I shall ever be compelled to  paint furniture for a living, but it is a consolation to me to  feel that I could do so if called on. There is a fascination  about painting furniture, Adams. I have painted the whole of my  bedroom at Blandings and am now engaged on the museum. You would  be surprised at the fascination of it. It suddenly came back to  me the other day that I had been inwardly longing to mess about  with paints and things since I was a boy. They stopped me when I  was a boy. I recollect my old father beating me with a walking  stick--Tell me, Adams, have I eaten my cheese?\"    \"Not yet, your lordship. I was about to send the waiter for it.\"    \"Never mind. Tell him to bring the bill instead. I remember that  I have an appointment. I must not be late.\"    \"Shall I take the fork, your lordship?\"    \"The fork?\"    \"Your lordship has inadvertently put a fork in your coat pocket.\"    Lord Emsworth felt in the pocket indicated, and with the air of  an inexpert conjurer whose trick has succeeded contrary to his  expectations produced a silver-plated fork. He regarded it with  surprise; then he looked wonderingly at Adams.    \"Adams, I'm getting absent-minded. Have you ever noticed any  traces of absent-mindedness in me before?\"    \"Oh, no, your lordship.\"    \"Well, it's deuced peculiar! I have no recollection whatsoever of  placing that fork in my pocket . . . Adams, I want a taxicab.\" He  glanced round the room, as though expecting to locate one by the  fireplace.    \"The hall porter will whistle one for you, your lordship.\"    \"So he will, by George!--so he will! Good day, Adams.\"    \"Good day, your lordship.\"    The Earl of Emsworth ambled benevolently to the door, leaving  Adams with the feeling that his day had been well-spent. He gazed  almost with reverence after the slow-moving figure.    \"What a nut!\" said Adams to his immortal soul.    Wafted through the sunlit streets in his taxicab, the Earl of  Emsworth smiled benevolently on London's teeming millions. He was  as completely happy as only a fluffy-minded old man with  excellent health and a large income can be. Other people worried  about all sorts of things--strikes, wars, suffragettes, the  diminishing birth rate, the growing materialism of the age, a  score of similar subjects.    Worrying, indeed, seemed to be the twentieth-century specialty.  Lord Emsworth never worried. Nature had equipped him with a mind  so admirably constructed for withstanding the disagreeableness of  life that if an unpleasant thought entered it, it passed out  again a moment later. Except for a few of life's fundamental  facts, such as that his check book was in the right-hand top  drawer of his desk; that the Honorable Freddie Threepwood was a  young idiot who required perpetual restraint; and that when in  doubt about anything he had merely to apply to his secretary,  Rupert Baxter--except for these basic things, he never remembered  anything for more than a few minutes.    At Eton, in the sixties, they had called him Fathead.    His was a life that lacked, perhaps, the sublimer emotions which  raise man to the level of the gods; but undeniably it was an  extremely happy one. He never experienced the thrill of ambition  fulfilled; but, on the other hand, he never knew the agony of  ambition frustrated. His name, when he died, would not live  forever in England's annals; he was spared the pain of worrying  about this by the fact that he had no desire to live forever in  England's annals. He was possibly as nearly contented as a human  being could be in this century of alarms and excursions.    Indeed, as he bowled along in his cab and reflected that a really  charming girl, not in the chorus of any West End theater, a girl  with plenty of money and excellent breeding, had--in a moment,  doubtless, of mental aberration--become engaged to be married to  the Honorable Freddie, he told himself that life at last was  absolutely without a crumpled rose leaf.    The cab drew up before a house gay with flowered window boxes.  Lord Emsworth paid the driver and stood on the sidewalk looking  up at this cheerful house, trying to remember why on earth he had  told the man to drive there.    A few moments' steady thought gave him the answer to the riddle.  This was Mr. Peters' town house, and he had come to it by  invitation to look at Mr. Peters' collection of scarabs. To be  sure! He remembered now--his collection of scarabs. Or was it  Arabs?    Lord Emsworth smiled. Scarabs, of course. You couldn't collect  Arabs. He wondered idly, as he rang the bell, what scarabs might  be; but he was interested in a fluffy kind of way in all forms of  collecting, and he was very pleased to have the opportunity of  examining these objects; whatever they were. He rather thought  they were a kind of fish.    There are men in this world who cannot rest; who are so  constituted that they can only take their leisure in the shape of  a change of work. To this fairly numerous class belonged Mr. J.  Preston Peters, father of Freddie's Aline. And to this merit--or  defect--is to be attributed his almost maniacal devotion to that  rather unattractive species of curio, the Egyptian scarab.    Five years before, a nervous breakdown had sent Mr. Peters to a  New York specialist. The specialist had grown rich on similar  cases and his advice was always the same. He insisted on Mr.  Peters taking up a hobby.    \"What sort of a hobby?\" inquired Mr. Peters irritably. His  digestion had just begun to trouble him at the time, and his  temper now was not of the best.    \"Now my hobby,\" said the specialist, \"is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#6)"],[1,"becomes enormous and far beyond my powers.\"[21] There is  something fine in this life of broad outlines, devoted whole-heartedly  to an idea, to a plan of research, which required a lifetime to carry  out.    An important histological discovery dating from this time is that of  the finer structure of muscle, made by Stensen (or Steno) in 1664. He  described the structure of muscle-fibres, resolving them into their  constituent fibrils.    To the microscope we owe not only histology but the comparative  anatomy of the lower animals. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries  the discovery of structure in the lower animals went on continuously,  as may be read in any history of Zoology.[22] We content ourselves here  with mentioning only some representative names.    In the 17th century Leeuenhoek, applying the microscope almost at  random, discovered fact after fact, his most famous, discovery being  that of the \"spermatic animalcules.\"    Swammerdam studied the metamorphoses of insects and made wonderfully  minute dissections of all sorts of animals, snails and insects  particularly. He described also the development of the frog. It is  curious to see what a grip his conception of metamorphosis had upon  him when he homologises the stages of the frog's development with the  Egg, the Worm, and the Nymph of insects (_Book of Nature_, p. 104,  Eng. trans., 1785). He even speaks of the human embryo as being at a  certain stage a Man-Vermicle.    In the 18th century, Reaumur and Bonnet continued the minute study of  insects, laying more stress, however, on their habits and physiology  than upon their anatomy. Lyonnet made a most laborious investigation  of the anatomy of the willow-caterpillar (1762). John Hunter (1728-93)  dissected all kinds of animals, from holothurians to whales. His  interest was, however, that of the physiologist, and he was not  specially interested in problems of form. It is interesting to note a  formulation in somewhat confused language of the recapitulation  theory. The passage occurs in his description of the drawings he made  to illustrate the development of the chick. It is quoted in full by  Owen (J. Hunter, _Observations on certain Parts of the Animal  OEconomy_, with Notes by Richard Owen. London, 1837. Preface, p.  xxvi). We give here the last and clearest sentence--\"If we were to  take a series of animals from the more imperfect to the perfect, we  should probably find an imperfect animal corresponding with some stage  of the most perfect.\"    The tendency of the time was not towards morphology, but rather to  general natural history and to systematics, the latter under the  powerful influence of Linnaeus (1707-1778). The former tendency is  well represented by Reaumur (1683-1757) with his observations on  insects, the digestion of birds, the regeneration of the crayfish's  legs, and a hundred other matters. To this tendency belong also  Trembley's famous experiments on Hydra (1744), and Roesel von  Rosenhof's _Insektenbelustigungen_ (1746-1761).    Bonnet (1720-1793) deserves special mention here, since in his _Traite  d'Insectologie_ (1745), and more fully in his _Contemplation de la  Nature_ (1764), he gives the most complete expression to the idea of  the _Echelle des etres_.    This idea seems to have taken complete possession of his imagination.  He extends it to the universe. Every world has its own scale of  beings, and all the scales when joined together form but one, which  then contains all the possible orders of perfection. At the end of the  Preface to his _Traite_ _d'Insectologie_ (OEuvres, i., 1779) he  gives a long table, headed \"Idee d'une Echelle des etres naturels,\"  and rather resembling a ladder, on the rungs of which the following  names appear:--    MAN.  Orang-utan.  Ape.    QUADRUPEDS.  Flying squirrel.  Bat.  Ostrich.    BIRDS.  Aquatic birds.  Amphibious birds.  Flying Fish.    FISH.  Creeping fish.  Eels.  Water serpents.    SERPENTS.  Slugs.  Snails.    SHELL FISH.  Tube-worms.  Clothes-moths.    INSECTS.  Gall insects.  Taenia.  Polyps.  Sea Nettles.  Sensitive plant.    PLANTS.  Lichens.  Moulds.  Fungi, Agarics.  Truffles.  Corals, and Coralloids.  Lithophytes.  Asbestos.  Talcs, Gypsums.  Selenites, Slates.    STONES.  Figured stones.  Crystals.    SALTS.  Vitriols.    METALS.    HALF-METALS.    SULPHURS.  Bitumens.    EARTHS.  Pure earth.    WATER.    AIR.    FIRE.    More subtile matter.    The nature of the transitional forms which he inserts between his  principal classes show very clearly his entire lack of morphological  insight--the transitions are functional. The positions assigned to  clothes-moths and corals are very curious! The whole scheme, so  fantastic in its details, was largely influenced by Leibniz's  continuity philosophy, and is in no way an improvement on the older  and saner Aristotelian scheme.    Robinet, in the fifth volume of his book _De la nature_ (1761-6),  foreshadows the somewhat similar views of the German  transcendentalists. \"All beings,\" he writes, \"have been conceived and  formed on one single plan, of which they are the endlessly graduated  variations: this prototype is the human form, the metamorphoses of  which are to be considered as so many steps towards the most excellent  form of being.\"[23]    The idea of a gradation of beings appears also in Buffon (1707-1788),  but here it takes more definitely its true character as a functional  gradation.[24] \"Since everything in Nature shades into everything  else,\" he says, \"it is possible to establish a scale for judging of  the degrees of the intrinsic qualities of every animal.\"[25]    He is quite well aware that the groups of Invertebrates are different  in structural plan from the Vertebrates--\"The animal kingdom includes  various animated beings, whose organisation is very different from our  own and from that of the animals whose body is similarly constructed  to ours.\"[26]    He limits himself to a consideration of the Vertebrates, deeming that  the economy of an oyster ought not to form part of his subject matter!  He has a clear perception of the unity of plan which reigns throughout  the vertebrate series.[27] What is new in Buffon is his interpretation  of the unity of plan. For the first time we find clearly expressed the  thought that unity of plan is to be explained by community of origin.    Buffon's utterances on this point are, as is well known, somewhat  vacillating. The famous passage, however, which occurs in his account  of the Ass shows pretty clearly that Buffon saw no theoretical  objection to the descent of all the varied species of animals from one  single form. Once admit, he argues, that within the bounds of a single  family one species may originate from the type species by  \"degeneration,\" then one might reasonably suppose that from a single  being Nature could in time produce all the other organised beings.[28]  Elsewhere, _e.g._, in the discourse _De la Degeneration des  Animaux_,[29] Buffon expresses himself with more caution. He finds that  it is possible to reduce the two hundred species of quadrupeds which  he has described to quite a small number of families \"from which it is  not impossible that all the rest are derived.\"[30] Within each of the  families the species branch off from a parent or type species. This we  may note is a great advance on the linear arrangement implied in the  idea of an _Echelle des etres_.[31]    It is a mistake to suppose that Buffon was par excellence a maker of  hypotheses. On the contrary he saw things very sanely and with a very  open mind. He expressly mentions the great difficulties which one  encounters in supposing that one species may arise from another by  \"degeneration.\" How does it happen that two individuals \"degenerate\"  just in the right direction and to the right stage so as to be capable  of breeding together? How is it that one does not find intermediate  links between species? One is reminded of the objections, not  altogether without validity, which were made to the Darwinian theory  in its early days. I cannot agree with those who think that Buffon was  an out-and-out evolutionist, who concealed his opinions for fear of  the Church. No doubt he did trim his sails--the palpably insincere  \"Mais non, il est certain, par la revelation, que tous les animaux ont  egalement participe a la grace de la creation,\"[32] following hard upon  the too bold hypothesis of the origin of all species from a single  one, is proof of it. But he was too sane and matter-of-fact a thinker  to go much beyond his facts, and his evolution doctrine remained  always tentative. One thing, however, he was sure of, that evolution  would give a rational foundation to the classification which, almost  in spite of himself, he recognised in Nature. If, and only if, the  species of one family originated from a single type species, could  families, be founded rationally, _avec raison_.    Buffon was, curiously enough, rather unwilling to recognise any  systematic unit higher than the species. Strictly; speaking there are  only individuals in Nature; but there are also groups of individuals  which resemble one another from generation to generation and are able  to breed together. These are species--Buffon adheres to the genetic  definition of species--and the species is a much more definite unit  than the genus, the order, the class, which are not divisions imposed  by us upon Nature. Species are definitely discontinuous,[33] and this  is the only discontinuity which Nature shows us. Buffon put his views  into practice in his _Histoire Naturelle_, where he describes species  after species, never uniting them into larger groups. We have seen,  however, how the facts forced upon him the conception of the \"family.\"    Buffon was no morphologist. He left to Daubenton what one might call  the \"dirty work\" of his book, the dissection and minute description of  the animals treated.    But Buffon was a man of genius, and"]]]
