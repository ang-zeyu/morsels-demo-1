If it is anyone,  I expect it's Tom Thorne. He has never been friends with me, since  that affair of the school window.\"    \"I will go at once and speak to his father,\" Mrs. Whitney said,  taking down her bonnet from the wall.    \"No, mother, you can't do that,\" Reuben exclaimed. \"We have got  nothing against him. The squire has ten times as good reason to  suspect me, as I have to suspect Tom Thorne; so as we know the  squire's wrong, it's ten times as likely we shall be wrong.  Besides, if he did it, of course he would deny it, he is the worst  liar in the village; and then folks would say I wasn't satisfied  with doing it myself, but I wanted to throw the blame on to him,  just as he did on me before. No, it won't do, mother.\"    Mrs. Whitney saw that it wouldn't do, and sat down again. Reuben  sat thinking, for some time.    \"I must go away, mother,\" he said at last. \"I can't stop here.  Every one in the village will get to know of it, and they will  point at me as the boy as poisoned the squire's dog, and then lied  about it. I couldn't stand that, mother.\"    \"And you sha'n't stand it, my boy,\" Mrs. Whitney said, \"not a day.  I will give up the cottage and move into Lewes, at once. I didn't  go there before, for I am known there, and don't like folk to see  how much I have come down in the world.\"    \"No, mother, you stop here, and I will go up to London. They say  there is lots of work there, and I suppose I can get on as well as  another.\"    \"I will not hear of your doing such a thing. I should never expect  to hear of you again. I should always be thinking that you had got  run over, or were starving in the streets, or dying in a workhouse.  No, Reuben, my plan's best. It's just silliness my not liking to  settle in Lewes; for of course it's better going where one is  known, and I should be lost in a strange place. No; I daresay I  shall find a cottage there, and I shall manage to get a living  somehow--perhaps open a little shop like this, and then you can be  apprenticed, and live at home.\"    An hour later, Mrs. Ellison called. Reuben had gone upstairs to lie  down, for his leg was very painful. Mrs. Whitney did not give her  visitor time to begin.    \"I know what you have called about, Mrs. Ellison, and I don't want  to talk about it with you. The squire has grievously wronged my  boy. I wouldn't have believed it of him, but he's done it; so now,  ma'm, I give a week's notice of this house, and here's my rent up  to that time, and I will send you the key when I go. And now, ma'm,  as I don't want any words about it, I think it will be better if  you go, at once.\"    Mrs. Ellison hesitated a moment. Never, from the time she entered  the village as the squire's wife, had she been thus spoken to; but  she saw at once, in Mrs. Whitney's face, that it were better not to  reply to her; and that her authority as the squire's wife had, for  once, altogether vanished. She therefore took up the money which  Mrs. Whitney had laid on the counter and, without a word, left the  shop.    \"I do believe, William,\" she said as, greatly ruffled and  indignant, she gave an account of the interview to the squire,  \"that the woman would have slapped my face, if I had said anything.  She is the most insolent creature I ever met.\"    \"Well, my dear,\" the squire said seriously, \"I can hardly wonder at  the poor woman's indignation. She has had a hard time of it, and  this must be a sad blow. Naturally she believes in her son's  innocence, and we must not altogether blame her, if she resents his  dismissal. It's a sad business altogether, and I know it will be a  worry and trouble to me for months. Mind, I don't doubt that the  boy did it; it does not seem possible that it should be otherwise.  Still, it is not absolutely proved; and upon my word, I wish now I  had said nothing at all about it. I like the boy, and I liked his  father before him; and as this story must get about, it cannot but  do him serious damage. Altogether it is a most tiresome business,  and I would give a hundred pounds if it hadn't taken place.\"    \"I really do not see why you should worry about it, William. The  boy has always been a troublesome boy, and perhaps this lesson may  do him good.\"    The squire did not attempt to argue the question. He felt really  annoyed and put out and, after wandering over the ground and  stables, he went down to the schoolhouse after the children had  been dismissed.    \"Have you heard, Shrewsbury, about that boy Whitney?\"    \"No, sir, I have heard nothing about him,\" the schoolmaster said.  \"He was here yesterday evening, as usual. His leg is no worse, I  hope. Those dog bites are always nasty things.\"    \"I wish it had been worse,\" the squire said testily; \"then he would  have been laid up quietly at home, instead of being about  mischief.\"    \"Why, what has he done, sir?\" the schoolmaster asked, in surprise.    The squire related the history of the dog's death, and of his  interview with Reuben. The schoolmaster looked serious, and  grieved.    \"What do you think of the matter, Shrewsbury?\" the squire asked,  when he had finished.    \"I would rather not give any opinion,\" the schoolmaster replied  quietly.    \"That means you think I am wrong,\" the squire said quickly. \"Well,  say it out, man; you won't offend me. I am half inclined to think I  was wrong, myself; and I would as lief be told so, as not.\"    \"I don't say you are wrong, sir,\" the schoolmaster said, \"except  that I think you assumed the boy's guilt too much as a matter of  course. Now, I have seen a great deal of him. I have a great liking  for him, and believe him to be not only a singularly intelligent  and hard-working lad, but a perfectly truthful and open one. I  allow that the circumstances are much against him; but the evidence  is, to my mind, completely overbalanced by his absolute denial. You  must remember that he saw that you were quite convinced of his  guilt; and that, in your eyes, his denial would be an aggravation  of the offence. Therefore you see he had no strong motive for  telling a lie.    \"Who killed your dog I do not know but, from my knowledge of his  character and assurance of his truthfulness, I am perfectly  convinced that Reuben Whitney did not do it. The boy is, in some  ways, very superior to the other lads I teach. I hear that his  father was in a good position, as a miller; and his mother is of a  different class, altogether, to the other women of the village. The  boy has a certain refinement about him, a thoughtfulness and  consideration which set him apart from the others. Mischievous and  somewhat inclined to be noisy as he generally is, on days when I  have not felt quite equal to my work he would notice it at once  and, without saying a word, would, by his quietness and attention  to his work, try to save me trouble; and I have heard him try to  quiet the others, as they trooped out. The boy has a good heart as  well as a good intellect, and nothing save his own confession would  make me believe that he poisoned your dog.\"    \"But he said he wished it was killed,\" the squire urged, as in  defence of his own opinion.    \"He said so, squire, at the time he was smarting with the pain of a  severe bite; and I think probably he meant no more than a man who,  under the same circumstances, would say, 'Confound the dog!' or  even a stronger oath.\"    Mr. Ellison was silenced, for when in wrath he was, himself, given  to use strong expressions.    \"I don't know what to say, Shrewsbury,\" he said at last. \"I am  afraid I have made a mess of it; but certainly, as I first heard  it, the case seemed to admit of no doubt. 'Pon my word, I don't  know what to do. My wife has just been up to see Mrs. Whitney, and  the woman blazed out at her, and wouldn't let her say a word, but  gave notice that she should give up the house at the end of the  week. If it hadn't been for that, I might have done something; but  Mrs. Ellison was very much aggrieved at her manner. Altogether,  it's one of the most annoying things I ever had to do with.\"    In the evening the schoolmaster put on his hat and went up, with  his wife, to Mrs. Whitney. The women had seen a good deal of each  other, as they both stood somewhat apart from the rest of the  village and, in thought and speech, differed widely from the  labourers' wives; and on evenings when the sewing class did not  meet, the schoolmaster's wife often went up for an hour or two to  Mrs. Whitney's, or the latter came down to the Shrewsburys'  cottage.    \"We have come up, Mrs. Whitney,\" the schoolmaster said as they  entered, \"to tell you how sorry we are to hear that you are going  to leave, and that we are still more sorry for the cause. Of  course, neither my wife nor myself believe for a moment that Reuben  poisoned the squire's dog. The idea is preposterous. I told the  squire as much, today.\"    Mrs. Whitney burst into tears. She had kept up all day, sustained  partly by indignation, and partly by the desire that Reuben should  not see that she felt it; but the thought that all the village  would believe Reuben guilty had cut her to the heart, and she had  felt so unwilling to face anyone that, as soon as Mrs. Ellison had  left, she had closed the shutters of her little shop; but she broke  down, now, from her relief at hearing that someone besides herself  believed the boy to be innocent.    \"I don't know what I shall do without you, Mrs. Whitney,\" Mrs.  Shrewsbury said, when the widow recovered her composure. \"I shall  miss you dreadfully. Is it quite settled that you will go?\"    \"Quite settled, Mrs. Shrewsbury. I wouldn't stop in the squire's  house for an hour longer than I could help, after his believing  Reuben to be guilty of poisoning his dog, and not believing the boy  when he said he had nothing to do with it. He ought to have known  my boy better than that. And he coming up only the other day, and  pretending he felt a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#6)"],[1," that innumerable unseen  eyes were malignantly rejoicing in her terror. At last, the climax to  her suspense seemed at hand. The unknown thing, until now too busy  with the clock to take heed of her, paused for a moment or so, as if  undecided what to do next, and then slowly began to veer round. But  the faint echo of a voice below, calling her by name, broke the  hypnotic spell that bound Diana to the floor, and with a frantic  spring she cleared the threshold of the room. She then tore madly  downstairs, never halting till she reached the dining-room, where she  sank on a sofa, and, more dead than alive, panted out to her amazed  sisters a full account of all that had transpired.    That night she shared her sister's bedroom, but neither she nor her  sister slept.    From this time till the return of Mrs. Gordon, nothing happened. It  was one evening after she came back, when she was preparing to get  into bed, that the door of her own room unexpectedly opened, and she  saw standing, on the threshold, the unmistakable figure of a man,  short and broad, with a great width of shoulders, and very long arms.  He was clad in a peajacket, blue serge trousers, and jack-boots. He  had a big, round, brutal head, covered with a tangled mass of yellow  hair, but where his face ought to have been there was only a blotch,  underlying which Mrs. Gordon detected the semblance to something  fiendishly vindictive and immeasurably nasty. But, in spite of the  horror his appearance produced, her curiosity was aroused with regard  to the two objects he carried in his hands, one of which looked like  a very bizarre bundle of red and white rags, and the other a small  bladder of lard. Whilst she was staring at them in dumb awe, he swung  round, and, hitching them savagely under his armpits, rushed across  the landing, and, with a series of apish bounds, sprang up the  staircase and disappeared in the gloom.    This was the climax; Mrs. Gordon felt another such encounter would  kill her. So, in spite of the fact that she had taken the flat for a  year, and had only just commenced her tenancy, she packed up her goods  and left the very next day. The report that the building was haunted  spread rapidly, and Mrs. Gordon had many indignant letters from the  landlord. She naturally made inquiries as to the early history of the  house, but of the many tales she listened to, only one, the  authenticity of which she could not guarantee, seemed to suggest any  clue to the haunting.    It was said that a retired Captain in the Merchant Service, many years  previously, had rented the rooms she had occupied.    He was an extraordinary individual, and, despite the fact that he had  lived so far inland, would never wear any but nautical clothes--blue  jersey and trousers, reefer coat and jack-boots. But this was not his  only peculiarity. His love of grog eventually brought on delirium  tremens, and his excessive irritability in the interval between each  attack was a source of anxiety to all who came in contact with him. At  that time there happened to be a baby in the rooms overhead, whose  crying so annoyed the Captain that he savagely informed its mother  that if she did not keep it quiet, he would not be answerable for the  consequences. His warnings having no effect, he flew upstairs one day,  when she was temporarily absent, and, snatching up the bread knife  from the table, decapitated the infant. He then stuffed both its head  and body into a grandfather's clock which stood in one corner of the  room, and, retiring to his own quarters, drank till he was insensible.    He was, of course, arrested on a charge of murder, but being found  \"insane\" he was committed during His Majesty's pleasure to a lunatic  asylum.    He eventually committed suicide by opening an artery in his leg with  one of his finger-nails.    As the details of this tragedy filled in so well with the phenomena  they had witnessed, the Gordons could not help regarding the story as  a very probable explanation of the hauntings. But, remember, its  authenticity is dubious.                                   CASE IV        JANE OF GEORGE STREET, EDINBURGH      \"The news that, for several years at any rate, George Street,  Edinburgh, was haunted,\" wrote a correspondent of mine some short time  ago, \"might cause no little surprise to many of its inhabitants.\" And  my friend proceeded to relate his experience of the haunting, which I  will reproduce as nearly as possible in his own words. I quote from  memory, having foolishly destroyed the letter.           *       *       *       *       *    I was walking in a leisurely way along George Street the other day,  towards Strunalls, where I get my cigars, and had arrived opposite No.  --, when I suddenly noticed, just ahead of me, a tall lady of  remarkably graceful figure, clad in a costume which, even to an  ignoramus in fashions like myself, seemed extraordinarily out of date.  In my untechnical language it consisted of a dark blue coat and  skirt, trimmed with black braid. The coat had a very high collar,  turned over to show a facing of blue velvet, its sleeves were very  full at the shoulders, and a band of blue velvet drew it tightly in at  the waist. Moreover, unlike every other lady I saw, she wore a small  hat, which I subsequently learned was a toque, with one white and one  blue plume placed moderately high at the side. The only other  conspicuous items of her dress, the effect of which was, on the whole,  quiet, were white glace gloves,--over which dangled gold curb  bracelets with innumerable pendants,--shoes, which were of patent  leather with silver buckles and rather high Louis heels, and fine,  blue silk openwork stockings. So much for her dress. Now for her  herself. She was a strikingly fair woman with very pale yellow hair  and a startlingly white complexion; and this latter peculiarity so  impressed me that I hastened my steps, determining to get a full view  of her. Passing her with rapid strides, I looked back, and as I did so  a cold chill ran through me,--what I looked at was--the face of the  dead. I slowed down and allowed her to take the lead.    I now observed that, startling as she was, no one else seemed to  notice her. One or two people obviously, though probably  unconsciously, possessing the germs of psychism, shivered when they  passed her, but as they neither slackened their pace nor turned to  steal a second look, I concluded they had not seen her. Without  glancing either to the right or left, she moved steadily on, past  Molton's the confectioner's, past Perrin's the hatter's. Once, I  thought she was coming to a halt, and that she intended crossing the  road, but no--on, on, on, till we came to D---- Street. There we were  preparing to cross over, when an elderly gentleman walked deliberately  into her. I half expected to hear him apologise, but naturally nothing  of the sort happened; she was only too obviously a phantom, and, in  accordance with the nature of a phantom, she passed right through him.  A few yards farther on, she came to an abrupt pause, and then, with a  slight inclination of her head as if meaning me to follow, she glided  into a chemist's shop. She was certainly not more than six feet ahead  of me when she passed through the door, and I was even nearer than  that to her when she suddenly disappeared as she stood before the  counter. I asked the chemist if he could tell me anything about the  lady who had just entered his shop, but he merely turned away and  laughed.    \"Lady!\" he said; \"what are you talking about? You're a bit out of your  reckoning. This isn't the first of April. Come, what do you want?\"    I bought a bottle of formamints, and reluctantly and regretfully  turned away. That night I dreamed I again saw the ghost. I followed  her up George Street just as I had done in reality; but when she came  to the chemist's shop, she turned swiftly round. \"I'm Jane!\" she said  in a hollow voice. \"Jane! Only Jane!\" and with that name ringing in my  ears I awoke.    Some days elapsed before I was in George Street again. The weather had  in the meanwhile undergone one of those sudden and violent changes, so  characteristic of the Scottish climate. The lock-gates of heaven had  been opened and the rain was descending in cataracts. The few  pedestrians I encountered were enveloped in mackintoshes, and carried  huge umbrellas, through which the rain was soaking, and pouring off  from every point. Everything was wet--everywhere was mud. The water,  splashing upwards, saturated the tops of my boots and converted my  trousers into sodden sacks. Some weather isn't fit for dogs, but this  weather wasn't good enough for tadpoles--even fish would have kicked  at it and kept in their holes. Imagine, then, the anomaly! Amidst all  this aqueous inferno, this slippery-sloppery, filth-bespattering  inferno, a spotlessly clean apparition in blue without either  waterproof or umbrella. I refer to Jane. She suddenly appeared, as I  was passing The Ladies' Tea Association Rooms, walking in front of me.  She looked just the same as when I last saw her--spick and span,  and--dry. I repeat the word--dry--for that is what attracted my  attention most. Despite the deluge, not a single raindrop touched  her--the plumes on her toque were splendidly erect and curly, her  shoe-buckles sparkled, her patent leathers were spotless, whilst the  cloth of her coat and skirt looked as sheeny as if they had but just  come from Keeley's.    Anxious to get another look at her face, I quickened my pace, and,  darting past her, gazed straight into her countenance. The result was  a severe shock. The terror of what I saw--the ghastly horror of her  dead white face--sent me reeling across the pavement. I let her pass  me, and, impelled by a sickly fascination, followed in her wake.    Outside a jeweller's stood a hansom--quite a curiosity in these days  of motors--and, as Jane glided past, the horse shied. "]]]
