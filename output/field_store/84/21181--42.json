There would be much propriety in dating the  Revolution from this daring act.    [1774]    Nor was this the only case of Rhode Island's forwardness in the  struggle. December 5, 1774, her General Assembly ordered Colonel  Nightingale to remove to Providence all the cannon and ammunition of  Fort George, except three guns, and this was done before the end of the  next day. More than forty cannon, with much powder and shot, were thus  husbanded for service to come. News of this was carried to New  Hampshire, and resulted in the capture of Fort William and Mary at New  Castle, December 14, 1774, which some have referred to as the opening  act of the Revolution. This deed was accomplished by fourteen men from  Durham, who entered the fort at night when the officers were at a ball  in Portsmouth. The powder which they captured is said to have done duty  at Bunker Hill.    [1776]    Most potent of all as a cause of the resolution to separate was Thomas  Paine's pamphlet, \"Common Sense,\" published in January, 1776, and  circulated widely throughout the colonies. Its lucid style, its homely  way of putting things, and its appeals to Scripture must have given it  at any rate a strong hold upon the masses of the people. It was doubly  and trebly triumphant from the fact that it voiced, in clear, bold  terms, a long-growing popular conviction of the propriety of  independence, stronger than men had dared to admit even to themselves.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Thomas Paine.      On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, rose in Congress, and,  in obedience to the command of his State, moved a resolution \"that the  united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent  States.\" John Adams seconded the motion. It led to great debate, which  evinced that New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and South  Carolina were not yet quite ready for so radical a step. Postponement  was therefore had till July 1st, a committee meantime being appointed to  draft a declaration.    On July 2d, after further long debate, participated in by John Adams,  Dickinson, Wilson, and many other of the ablest men in Congress, not  all, even now, favorable to the measure, the famous Declaration of  Independence was adopted by vote of all the colonies but New York, whose  representatives abstained from voting for lack of sufficiently definite  instructions. We celebrate July 4th because on that day the document was  authenticated by the signatures of the President and Secretary of  Congress, and published, Not until August 2d had all the representatives  affixed their names. Ellery stood at the secretary's side as the various  delegates signed, and declares that he saw only dauntless resolution in  every eye. \"Now we must hang together,\" said Franklin, \"or we shall hang  separately.\"    The honor of writing the Declaration belongs to Thomas Jefferson, of  Virginia, who was to play so prominent a part in the early political  history of the United States. At this time he was thirty-three years  old. He was by profession a lawyer, of elegant tastes, well read in  literature, deeply versed in political history and philosophy. He was  chosen to draft the instrument chiefly because of the great ability of  other state papers from his pen. It is said that he consulted no books  during the composition, but wrote from the overflowing fulness of his  mind.    It is an interesting inquiry how far the language of the document was  determined by utterances of a like kind already put forth by towns and  counties. There had been many of these, and much discussion has occurred  upon the question which of them was first. Perhaps the honor belongs to  the town of Sheffield, Mass., which so early as January 12, 1773,  proclaimed the grievances and the rights of the colonies, among these  the right of self-government. Mendon, in the same State, in the same  year passed resolutions containing three fundamental propositions of the  great Declaration itself: that all men have an equal right to life and  liberty, that this right is inalienable, and that government must  originate in the free consent of the people. It is worthy of note that  the only important change made by Congress in what Jefferson had  prepared was the striking out, in deference to South Carolina and  Georgia, of a clause reflecting on slavery.    Copies of the immortal paper were carried post-haste up and down the  land, and Congress's bold deed was everywhere hailed with enthusiastic  demonstrations of joy. The stand for independence wrought powerfully for  good, both at home and abroad. At home it assisted vacillating minds to  a decision, as well as bound all the colonies more firmly together by  committing them irreconcilably to an aggressive policy. Abroad it tended  to lift the colonies out of the position of rebels and to gain them  recognition among the nations of the earth.    Let us now inquire into the political character of these bodies of  people which this Declaration by their delegates had erected into \"free  and independent States.\"    Five colonies had adopted constitutions, revolutionary of course, before  the decisive manifesto. There was urgent need for such action. The few  remaining fragments of royal governments were powerless and decadent.  Anarchy was threatening everywhere. Some of the royal governors had  fled. In South Carolina the judges refused to act. In other places, as  western Massachusetts, they had been forcibly prevented from acting. In  most of the colonies only small parts of the old assemblies could be  gotten together.    New Hampshire led off with a new constitution in January, 1776. South  Carolina followed in March. By the close of the year nearly all the  colonies had established governments of their own. New York and Georgia  did not formally adopt new constitutions until the next year. In  Massachusetts a popular assembly assumed legislative and executive  powers from July, 1775, till 1780, when a new constitution went into  force. Connecticut and Rhode Island, as we have seen already, continued  to use their royal charters--the former till 1818, the latter till 1842.    Nowhere was the general framework of government greatly changed by  independence. The governors were of course now elected by the people,  and they suffered some diminution of power. Legislatures were composed  of two houses, both elective, no hereditary legislators being  recognized. All the States still had Sunday laws; most of them had  religious tests. In South Carolina only members of a church could vote.  In New Jersey an office-holder must profess belief in the faith of some  Protestant sect. Pennsylvania required members of the legislature to  avow faith in God, a future state, and the inspiration of the  Scriptures. The new Massachusetts constitution provided that laws  against plays, extravagance in dress, diet, etc., should be passed.  Property qualifications continued to limit suffrage. Virginia and  Georgia changed their land laws, abolishing entails and primogeniture.    The sole momentous novelty was that everyone of the new constitutions  proceeded upon the theory of popular sovereignty. The new governments  derived their authority solely and directly from the people. And this  authority, too, was not surrendered to the government, but simply--and  this only in part--intrusted to it as the temporary agent of the  sovereign people, who remained throughout the exclusive source of  political power.    The new instruments of government were necessarily faulty and imperfect.  All have since been amended, and several entirely remodelled. But they  rescued the colonies from impending anarchy and carried them safely  through the throes of the Revolution.        CHAPTER IV.    OUTBREAK OF WAR: WASHINGTON'S MOVEMENTS    [1775]    By the spring of 1775 Massachusetts was practically in rebellion. Every  village green was a drill-ground, every church a town arsenal. General  Gage occupied Boston with 3,000 British regulars. The flames were  smouldering; at the slightest puff they would flash out into open war.    On the night of April 18th people along the road from Boston to Concord  were roused from sleep by the cry of flying couriers--\"To arms! The  redcoats are coming!\" When the British advance reached Lexington at  early dawn, it found sixty or seventy minute-men drawn up on the green.  \"Disperse, ye rebels!\" shouted the British officer. A volley was fired,  and seven Americans fell dead. The king's troops, with a shout, pushed  on to Concord. Most of the military stores, however, which they had come  to destroy had been removed. A British detachment advanced to Concord  Bridge, and in the skirmish here the Americans returned the British  fire.      [Illustration: Map from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, Great Lakes to  the Gulf of Mexico.]  Map of the United Colonies at the Beginning of the Revolution.      \"By the rude bridge that arched the flood,    Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,  Here once the embattled farmers stood,    And fired the shot heard round the world.\"    [Footnote: From R. W. Emerson's Concord Hymn, sung at the completion of  the Battle Monument near Concord North Bridge, April 19, 1836.]      [Illustration: Sketch of Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill.]  A Profile View of the Heights of Charlestown.      The whole country was by this time swarming with minute-men. The crack  of the rifle was heard from behind every wall and fence and tree along  the line of march. The redcoats kept falling one by one at the hands of  an invisible foe. The march became a retreat, the retreat almost a rout.  At sunset the panting troops found shelter in Boston. Out of 1,800  nearly 300 were killed, wounded, or missing. The American loss was about  ninety. The war of the rebellion had begun.    All that day and the next night the tramp of minute-men marching to  Boston was heard throughout New"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22581"],[0,"The Child-Voice in Singing (#6)"],[1,"force the voice in  the effort, but a chance is offered to any ambitious youngster to pitch  in and outsing the leader; from all of which follows naturally the idea  that all prominence of individual voice must be discouraged, forbidden  even. The songs and exercises must be led, it is true, but by the  teacher and _silently_. Then, again, unless the teacher is silent she  cannot be a good critic. Think of a voice-trainer singing each solfeggio  and song with his pupil during the lesson.    Certainly it is often necessary for the teacher to sing, but only to  illustrate or correct, or to teach a song. In the last, if the teacher  will remain silent while the class repeat the line sung to them, and  will proceed in the same way until the whole is memorized by the class,  not only will time be economized, but the tone can be kept as soft as is  desired and individual shouters checked. Once more it must be insisted  that soft, very soft singing only, can be allowed. And this applies to  the entire compass used. Children of the ages mentioned can, as has  already been shown, break from the thin to the thick voice at any pitch,  it only requiring a little extra push for the upper tones.    Finally, as an excellent test to settle if the tone is soft enough to  ensure the use of the thin register beyond doubt, require the class to  sing so that no particular voice can be distinguished from the others,  which will make the tone as that of one voice, and perhaps lead you to  doubt if all are singing, until convinced by the movement of their  mouths. The tone will seem pretty light and thin, but will be sweet as  the trill of a bird.      _To Distinguish Registers._    The difficulty which may be experienced in attempting to distinguish  between the two registers must not be disregarded. If the voices of  children were never entrusted to any save professional voice-teachers,  a very few hints upon their management would perhaps suffice, for the  ear of the teacher of voice and singing is presumably trained in the  differentiation in tone-quality occasioned by changes in the action of  the vocal mechanism. When, however, we reflect that of the thousands of  teachers in our public schools very few, indeed, have ever heard of  voice-registers, and much less been accustomed to note distinctions in  tone-timbre between them, the need of a detailed plan of procedure is  seen.    It is safe to assert that anyone with a musical ear can with a little  patience learn to distinguish one register from another. There is no  vocal transition so marked as the change from thick to thin register in  the child-voice, unless it be the change from the chest to the head or  falsetto in the man's voice. Suppose we take a class of say twelve from  the fourth year averaging nine years of age. Give them the pitch of C.        [Music: c']    Require them to sing up the scale loudly. As they reach the upper tone        [Music: c'']    stop them and ask them to sing that, and the two tones above _very  softly_. The change in tone will be quite apparent. The tone used in  ascending the scale of C, singing loudly, will be reedy, thick and  harsh-- the thick register. The tone upon        [Music: c'' d'' e'']    singing very softly, will be flute-like, thin and clear-- the thin  register. Again, let them sing E first line with full strength of voice  and then the octave lightly, or have them sing G second line, first  softly and then loudly, or, again, let them ascend the scale of E  singing as light a tone as possible, and then descend singing as loud as  they can. In each case the change from thick to thin voice, or vice  versa, will be illustrated; and in singing the scale of E as suggested,  the break of voice a little higher or lower in individual cases will be  noticed. It is quite possible that some members of the class may use the  thick voice on each tone of the descending scale beginning with the  highest.    Care must always be taken that in singing softly the mouth be well  opened. The tendency will be to close it when required to sing lightly,  but the tone, then, will be nothing but a humming noise. It may as well  be said here that a great deal of future trouble and labor may be  avoided, if, from the first, pupils are taught to keep the mouth fairly  well opened, and the lips sufficiently apart to permit the free emission  of tone. Let the lower jaw have a loose hinge, so to speak. It is well  enough to point out also that when the lower jaw drops, the tongue goes  down with it, and should remain extended along the floor of the mouth  with the tip against the teeth while vowel-sounds are sung.    There are many other ways than those already suggested, in which the  distinction between the registers may be shown. Let the whole class sing        [Music: d'' c'' b']    softly, and then the next lower tone or tones loudly. The thick quality  will be heard easily enough. Or from the room select a pupil, one of the  class who has, in the phraseology of the schoolroom, a good voice, to  sing the scale of D ascending and descending. If the pupil be not timid,  and the kind referred to are not usually, and if loud singing has been  customary, the tone will be coarse and reedy throughout. Now let another  pupil who has what is called a light voice, and who daily sits modestly  in the shade of his boisterous brother, sing the same scale. The tone in  all likelihood will be pure and flutey, at least upon the higher notes.    Take the scale of E now and have each pupil in the room sing it alone.  There may certainly be some who cannot sing the scale, and if the daily  singing has been harsh, the number may be large, but postponing the  consideration of these so-called monotones and directing the attention  wholly to the quality or timbre of tone used by the different pupils, it  may be observed that some use the thick voice only, some use the thin  voice, others break from the thick voice into the thin at one pitch as  they ascend, and from the thin to thick voice at a lower pitch as they  descend; and if required to sing again, may perhaps pass from one voice  to the other at different pitches. Others again may exhibit a blending  of the two voices at certain pitches. In fact, unless the degree of  power is suddenly changed, a break from the thick tone upon one note to  the thin tone upon the next note or vice versa seldom occurs.    The same illustrative tests may be applied to children of any grade, or  of any age up to the period when the voice changes, only the break will  occur lower with older pupils. Suppose, now, the teacher has obtained a  tolerably clear idea of the differences between the registers; she  should then arouse a perception of tone-quality in her pupils. Let the  beauty of soft, light tone as contrasted with loud, harsh tone be once  clearly demonstrated to a class, and the interest and best efforts of  every girl or boy who has the germ of music within them will be  enlisted. Those who grumble because they may not sing out good and loud  may be disregarded, and with a clear conscience. The future will most  likely reveal such incipient lovers of noisy music as pounders of drums  and blowers of brass.    Select now a number of the class who upon trial have been found to have  light, clear voices and who are not prone to shout. Let them sing        [Music: e'' {or} f'']    and then slowly descend the scale of E or F, singing each tone softly,  and those below C        [Music: c'']    very lightly. This will insure the uninterrupted use of the thin  register to the lowest note. Let them now sing up and down the scale  several times, observing the same caution when notes below C or B are  sung, and also insisting that no push be given to the upper notes. Now,  first excusing monotones, let the other pupils in the room sing first  down the scale and then up, imitating the quality and softness of tone  of the picked class. Recollect, you are asking something of your pupils  which it is perfectly easy for them to do. It may be that the strength  of well-formed habits stands opposed to the change, but, on the other  hand, every musical instinct latent, or partly awakened, is becoming  alert and proving the truth of your teaching better and faster than can  any finespun reasoning. Illustrate the difference in tone-quality  between the thick and thin register as often as it is necessary, to show  your pupils what you wish to avoid and how you wish them to sing. When  in doubt whether or not the thin quality is being sung, require softer  singing until you are sure. It is better to err upon the side of soft  singing than to take any chances.    In time teachers will become quick to detect the change in register, and  in time also the pupils who are trained to sing in the thin voice will  yield to the force of good habit, as they once did to bad habit, and  seldom offend by too loud or too harsh tone.    The inquiry may naturally have arisen ere this: Are syllables, i.e.,  _do_, _re_, _mi_, etc., to be used, or the vowel-sounds? It is  immaterial from the standpoint of tone-production, whether either or  both are used. Until children are thoroughly accustomed to sing softly,  they will be kept upon the thin register more easily when singing with a  vowel-sound, than when using the syllables. The reason is that the  articulation of the initial consonants of the syllables requires  considerable movement of the organs of speech, viz., the tongue, lips,  etc., and these movements are accompanied by a continually-increasing  outrush of air from the lungs, occasioning a corresponding increase in  the volume of sound. Adult voices show the same tendency to increase the  volume of tone when first applying words to a passage practiced  pianissimo with a vowel-sound. It is advisable then to sing scales and  drill upon them with a vowel-sound, and to recur to the same drill for a  corrective, when a tendency to use the thick voice in singing "]]]
