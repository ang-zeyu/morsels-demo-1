These different forms of the same element  are called _allotropic states_ or _forms_ of the element. These forms  differ not only in physical properties but also in their energy  contents. Elements often exist in a variety of forms which look quite  different. These differences may be due to accidental causes, such as  the size or shape of the particles or the way in which the element was  prepared. Only such forms, however, as have different energy contents  are properly called allotropic forms.      MEASUREMENT OF GAS VOLUMES    ~Standard conditions.~ It is a well-known fact that the volume occupied by  a definite weight of any gas can be altered by changing the temperature  of the gas or the pressure to which it is subjected. In measuring the  volume of gases it is therefore necessary, for the sake of accuracy, to  adopt some standard conditions of temperature and pressure. The  conditions agreed upon are (1) a temperature of 0 deg., and (2) a pressure  equal to the average pressure exerted by the atmosphere at the sea  level, that is, 1033.3 g. per square centimeter. These conditions of  temperature and pressure are known as the _standard conditions_, and  when the volume of a gas is given it is understood that the measurement  was made under these conditions, unless it is expressly stated  otherwise. For example, the weight of a liter of oxygen has been given  as 1.4285 g. This means that one liter of oxygen, measured at a  temperature of 0 deg. and under a pressure of 1033.3 g. per square  centimeter, weighs 1.4285 g.    The conditions which prevail in the laboratory are never the standard  conditions. It becomes necessary, therefore, to find a way to calculate  the volume which a gas will occupy under standard conditions from the  volume which it occupies under any other conditions. This may be done in  accordance with the following laws.    ~Law of Charles.~ This law expresses the effect which a change in the  temperature of a gas has upon its volume. It may be stated as follows:  _For every degree the temperature of a gas rises above zero the volume  of the gas is increased by 1/273 of the volume which it occupies at  zero; likewise for every degree the temperature of the gas falls below  zero the volume of the gas is decreased by 1/273 of the volume which it  occupies at zero, provided in both cases that the pressure to which the  gas is subjected remains constant._    If V represents the volume of gas at 0 deg., then the volume at 1 deg. will be  V + 1/273 V; at 2 deg. it will be V + 2/273 V; or, in general, the  volume v, at the temperature t, will be expressed by the formula        (1) v = V + t/273 V,        or (2) v = V(1 + (t/273)).    Since 1/273 = 0.00366, the formula may be written        (3) v = V(1 + 0.00366t).    Since the value of V (volume under standard conditions) is the one  usually sought, it is convenient to transpose the equation to the  following form:        (4) V = v/(1 + 0.00366t).    The following problem will serve as an illustration of the application  of this equation.    The volume of a gas at 20 deg. is 750 cc.; find the volume it will occupy at  0 deg., the pressure remaining constant.    In this case, v = 750 cc. and t = 20. By substituting these values,  equation (4) becomes        V = 750/(1 + 0.00366 x 20) = 698.9 cc.    ~Law of Boyle.~ This law expresses the relation between the volume  occupied by a gas and the pressure to which it is subjected. It may be  stated as follows: _The volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the  pressure under which it is measured, provided the temperature of the gas  remains constant._    If V represents the volume when subjected to a pressure P and v  represents its volume when the pressure is changed to p, then, in  accordance with the above law, V : v :: p : P, or VP = vp.  In other words, for a given weight of a gas the product of the numbers  representing its volume and the pressure to which it is subjected is a  constant.    Since the pressure of the atmosphere at any point is indicated by the  barometric reading, it is convenient in the solution of the problems to  substitute the latter for the pressure measured in grams per square  centimeter. The average reading of the barometer at the sea level is 760  mm., which corresponds to a pressure of 1033.3 g. per square centimeter.  The following problem will serve as an illustration of the application  of Boyle's law.    A gas occupies a volume of 500 cc. in a laboratory where the barometric  reading is 740 mm. What volume would it occupy if the atmospheric  pressure changed so that the reading became 750 mm.?    Substituting the values in the equation VP = vp, we have 500 x 740 =  v x 750, or v = 493.3 cc.    ~Variations in the volume of a gas due to changes both in temperature and  pressure.~ Inasmuch as corrections must be made as a rule for both  temperature and pressure, it is convenient to combine the equations  given above for the corrections for each, so that the two corrections  may be made in one operation. The following equation is thus obtained:        (5) V_{s} = vp/(760(1 + 0.00366t)),    in which V_{s} represents the volume of a gas under standard  conditions and v, p, and t the volume, pressure, and temperature  respectively at which the gas was actually measured.    The following problem will serve to illustrate the application of this  equation.    A gas having a temperature of 20 deg. occupies a volume of 500 cc. when  subjected to a pressure indicated by a barometric reading of 740 mm.  What volume would this gas occupy under standard conditions?    In this problem v = 500, p = 740, and t = 20. Substituting these  values in the above equation, we get        V_{s} = (500 x 740)/(760 (1 + 0.00366 x 20)) = 453.6 cc.    [Illustration: Fig. 8]    ~Variations in the volume of a gas due to the pressure of aqueous vapor.~  In many cases gases are collected over water, as explained under the  preparation of oxygen. In such cases there is present in the gas a  certain amount of water vapor. This vapor exerts a definite pressure,  which acts in opposition to the atmospheric pressure and which therefore  must be subtracted from the latter in determining the effective pressure  upon the gas. Thus, suppose we wish to determine the pressure to which  the gas in tube A (Fig. 8) is subjected. The tube is raised or lowered  until the level of the water inside and outside the tube is the same.  The atmosphere presses down upon the surface of the water (as indicated  by the arrows), thus forcing the water upward within the tube with a  pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure. The full force of this  upward pressure, however, is not spent in compressing the gas within the  tube, for since it is collected over water it contains a certain amount  of water vapor. This water vapor exerts a pressure (as indicated by the  arrow within the tube) in opposition to the upward pressure. It is  plain, therefore, that the effective pressure upon the gas is equal to  the atmospheric pressure less the pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor.  The pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor increases with the  temperature. The figures representing the extent of this pressure (often  called the _tension of aqueous vapor_) are given in the Appendix. They  express the pressure or tension in millimeters of mercury, just as the  atmospheric pressure is expressed in millimeters of mercury.  Representing the pressure of the aqueous vapor by a, formula (5)  becomes        (6) V_{s} = v(p - a)/(760(1 + 0.00366t)).    The following problem will serve to illustrate the method of applying  the correction for the pressure of the aqueous vapor.    The volume of a gas measured over water in a laboratory where the  temperature is 20 deg. and the barometric reading is 740 mm. is 500 cc. What  volume would this occupy under standard conditions?    The pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor at 20 deg. (see table in Appendix)  is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of mercury 17.4 mm. in  height. Substituting the values of v, t, p, and a in formula  (6), we have        (6) V_{s} = 500(740 - 17.4)/(760(1 + 0.00366 x 20)) = 442.9 cc.    ~Adjustment of tubes before reading gas volumes.~ In measuring the volumes  of gases collected in graduated tubes or other receivers, over a liquid  as illustrated in Fig. 8, the reading should be taken after raising or  lowering the tube containing the gas until the level of the liquid  inside and outside the tube is the same; for it is only under these  conditions that the upward pressure within the tube is the same as the  atmospheric pressure.

I sleep so sound all night, mother, that I shall never wake,      If you do not call me loud when the day begins to break;      But I must gather knots of flowers, and buds and garlands gay,      For I'm to be queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be queen o' the May.    The old year passed away, and the black-eyed rustic maiden was dying.  She hoped to greet the new year before her eyes closed in death, and  bade her mother once again to be sure to call her early; but it was not  now because she slept so soundly. Alas! no.        Good night, sweet mother; call me before the day is born.      All night I lie awake, but I fall asleep at morn;      But I would see the sun rise upon the glad New Year,      So, if you're waking, call me, call me early, mother dear.    The day rose and passed away, but Alice lingered on till March. The  snow-drops had gone before her, and the violets were in bloom. Robin had  dearly loved the child, but the thoughtless village beauty, in her  joyous girlhood, tossed her head at him, and never thought of love, but  now, that she was going to the land of shadows, her dying words were:        And say to Robin a kind word, and tell him not to fret;      There's many worthier than I, would make him happy yet.
