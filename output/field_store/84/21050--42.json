Economic activity is  strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa conducts the  great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing  plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the  primary export. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to  American Samoa's economic well-being. According to one observer,  attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are  restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and  its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a developing sector, may be held  back in 1998 by the financial difficulties in East Asia.    GDP: purchasing power parity-$150 million (1995 est.)

The French posts, military, commercial, and religious, had been  pushed westward to the head of Lake Superior. The Mississippi had been  discovered and explored, and the colonies planted from Canada along its  banks and the banks of its tributaries had been met by the expeditions  proceeding direct from France through the Gulf of Mexico. The claims of  France in America included not only the vast domain of Canada, but a  half of Maine, a half of Vermont, more than a half of New York, the  entire valley of the Mississippi, and Texas as far as the Rio Bravo del  Norte.[21:2] And these claims were asserted by actual and almost  undisputed occupancy.    The seventy years that followed were years of \"storm and stress\" for the  French colonies and missions. The widening areas occupied by the French  and by the English settlers brought the rival establishments into nearer  neighborhood, into sharper competition, and into bloody collision.  Successive European wars--King William's War, Queen Anne's War (of the  Spanish succession), King George's War (of the Austrian  succession)--involved the dependencies of France and those of England in  the conflicts of their sovereigns. These were the years of terror along  the exposed northern frontier of English settlements in New England and  New York, when massacre and burning by bands of savages, under French  instigation and leadership, made the names of Haverhill and Deerfield  and Schenectady memorable in American history, and when, in desperate  campaigns against the Canadian strongholds, the colonists vainly sought  to protect themselves from the savages by attacking the centers from  which the murderous forays were directed. But each successive treaty of  peace between England and France confirmed and reconfirmed the French  claims to the main part of her American domain. The advances of French  missions and settlements continued southward and westward, in spite of  jealousy in European cabinets as the imposing magnitude of the plans of  French empire became more distinctly disclosed, and in spite of the  struggles of the English colonies both North and South. When, on the 4th  of July, 1754, Colonel George Washington surrendered Fort Necessity,  near the fork of the Ohio, to the French, \"in the whole valley of the  Mississippi, to its headsprings in the Alleghanies, no standard floated  but that of France.\"[22:1]    There seemed little reason to doubt that the French empire in America,  which for a century and a half had gone on expanding and strengthening,  would continue to expand and strengthen for centuries to come. Sudden as  lightning, in August, 1756, the Seven Years' War broke out on the other  side of the globe. The treaty with which it ended, in February, 1763,  transferred to Great Britain, together with the Spanish territory of  Florida, all the French possessions in America, from the Arctic Ocean to  the Gulf of Mexico. \"As a dream when one awaketh,\" the magnificent  vision of empire, spiritual and secular, which for so many generations  had occupied the imagination of French statesmen and churchmen, was  rudely and forever dispelled. Of the princely wealth, the brilliant  talents, the unsurpassed audacity of adventure, the unequaled heroism of  toil and martyrdom expended on the great project, how strangely meager  and evanescent the results! In the districts of Lower Canada there  remain, indeed, the institutions of a French Catholic population; and  the aspect of those districts, in which the pledge of full liberty to  the dominant church has been scrupulously fulfilled by the British  government, may reasonably be regarded as an indication of what France  would have done for the continent in general. But within the present  domain of the United States the entire results of a century and a half  of French Catholic colonization and evangelization may be summed up as  follows: In Maine, a thousand Catholic Indians still remain, to remind  one of the time when, as it is boldly claimed, the whole Indian  population of that province were either converted or under Jesuit  training.[23:1] In like manner, a scanty score of thousands of Catholic  Indians on various reservations in the remote West represent the time  when, at the end of the French domination, \"all the North American  Indians were more or less extensively converted\" to Catholic  Christianity, \"all had the gospel preached to them.\"[23:2] The splendid  fruits of the missions among the Iroquois, from soil watered by the  blood of martyrs, were wasted to nothing in savage intertribal wars.  Among the Choctaws and Chickasaws of the South and Southwest, among whom  the gospel was by and by to win some of its fairest trophies, the French  missionaries achieved no great success.[23:3] The French colonies from  Canada, planted so prosperously along the Western rivers, dispersed,  leaving behind them some straggling families. The abundant later growth  of the Catholic Church in that region was to be from other seed and  stock. The region of Louisiana alone, destined a generation later to be  included within the boundaries of the great republic, retained  organized communities of French descent and language; but, living as  they were in utter unbelief and contempt of religion and morality, it  would be an unjust reproach on Catholicism to call them Catholic. The  work of the gospel had got to be begun from the foundation. Nevertheless  it is not to be doubted that remote memories or lingering traditions of  a better age survived to aid the work of those who by and by should  enter in to rebuild the waste places.[24:1]    There are not a few of us, wise after the event, who recognize a final  cause of this surprising and almost dramatic failure, in the manifest  intent of divine Providence that the field of the next great empire in  the world's history should not become the exclusive domain of an  old-world monarchy and hierarchy; but the immediate efficient causes of  it are not so obvious. This, however, may justly be said: some of the  seeming elements of strength in the French colonization proved to be  fatal elements of weakness.    1. The French colonies had the advantage of royal patronage,  endowment,[24:2] and protection, and of unity of counsel and direction.  They were all parts of one system, under one control. And their centers  of vitality, head and heart, were on the other side of the sea.  Subsisting upon the strength of the great monarchy, they must needs  share its fortunes, evil as well as good. When, after the reverses of  France in the Seven Years' War, it became necessary to accept hard terms  of peace, the superb framework of empire in the West fell to the  disposal of the victors. \"America,\" said Pitt, \"was conquered in  Germany.\"    2. The business basis of the French colonies, being that of trade with  the Indians rather than a self-supporting agriculture, favored the swift  expansion of these colonies and their wide influence among the Indians.  Scattered companies of fur-traders would be found here and there,  wherever were favorable points for traffic, penetrating deeply into the  wilderness and establishing friendly business relations with the  savages. It has been observed that the Romanic races show an alacrity  for intermarriage with barbarous tribes that is not to be found in the  Teutonic. The result of such relations is ordinarily less the elevating  of the lower race than the dragging down of the higher; but it tends for  the time to give great advantage in maintaining a powerful political  influence over the barbarians. Thus it was that the French, few in  number, covered almost the breadth of the continent with their  formidable alliances; and these alliances were the offensive and  defensive armor in which they trusted, but they were also their peril.  Close alliance with one savage clan involved war with its enemies. It  was an early misfortune of the French settlers that their close friendly  relations with their Huron neighbors embattled against them the  fiercest, bravest, and ablest of the Indian tribes, the confederacy of  the Six Nations, which held, with full appreciation of its strategic  importance, the command of the exits southward from the valley of the  St. Lawrence. The fierce jealousy of the Iroquois toward the allies of  their hereditary antagonists, rather than any good will toward white  settlers of other races, made them an effectual check upon French  encroachments upon the slender line of English, Dutch, and Swedish  settlements that stretched southward from Maine along the Atlantic  coast.    3. In one aspect it was doubtless an advantage to the French missions in  America that the sharp sectarian competitions between the different  clerical orders resulted finally in the missions coming almost  exclusively under the control of the Jesuit society. This result insured  to the missions the highest ability in administration and direction,  ample resources of various sorts, and a force of missionaries whose  personal virtues have won for them unstinted eulogy even from unfriendly  sources--men the ardor of whose zeal was rigorously controlled by a more  than martial severity of religious discipline. But it would be uncandid  in us to refuse attention to those grave charges against the society  brought by Catholic authorities and Catholic orders, and so enforced as,  after long and acrimonious controversy, to result in the expulsion of  the society from almost every nation of Catholic Europe, in its being  stigmatized by Pope Benedict XIV., in 1741, as made up of \"disobedient,  contumacious, captious, and reprobate persons,\" and at"]]]
