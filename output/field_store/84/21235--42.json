[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#6)"],[1," The last movement begins with a ringing _pomposo_, and I cannot  explain its meaning better than by quoting Mrs. MacDowell's words:  \"Mr. MacDowell's idea was, so to speak, as follows: He wished to  heighten the darkness of tragedy by making it follow closely on the  heels of triumph. Therefore, he attempted to make the last movement a  steadily progressive triumph, which, at its climax, is utterly broken  and shattered. In doing this he has tried to epitomize the whole work.  While in the other movements he aimed at expressing tragic details,  in the last he has tried to generalize; thinking that the most  poignant tragedy is that of catastrophe in the hour of triumph.\"    The third sonata (op. 57) is dedicated to Grieg and to the musical  exploitation of an old-time Skald reciting glorious battles, loves,  and deaths in an ancient castle. The atmosphere of mystery and  barbaric grandeur is obtained and sustained by means new to piano  literature and potent in color and vigor. The sonata formula is warped  to the purpose of the poet, but the themes have the classic ideal of  kinship. The battle-power of the work is tremendous. Huneker calls it  \"an epic of rainbow and thunder,\" and Henry T. Finck, who has for many  years devoted a part of his large ardor to MacDowell's cause, says of  the work: \"It is MacDowellish,--more MacDowellish than anything he has  yet written. It is the work of a musical thinker. There are harmonies  as novel as those we encounter in Schubert, Chopin, or Grieg, yet with  a stamp of their own.\"    The \"Sonata Eroica\" (op. 50) bears the legend \"Flos regum Arthurus.\"  It is also in G minor. The spirit of King Arthur dominates the work  ideally, and justifies not only the ferocious and warlike first  subject with its peculiar and influential rhythm, but the  old-fashioned and unadorned folk-tone of the second subject. In the  working out there is much bustle and much business of trumpets. In the  reprise the folk-song appears in the tonic minor, taken most  unconventionally in the bass under elaborate arpeggiations in the  right hand. The coda, as in the other sonata, is simply a strong  passage of climax. Arthur's supernatural nature doubtless suggested  the second movement, with its elfin airs, its flibbertigibbet  virtuosity, and its magic of color. The third movement might have been  inspired by Tennyson's version of Arthur's farewell to Guinevere, it  is such a rich fabric of grief. The finale seems to me to picture the  Morte d'Arthur, beginning with the fury of a storm along the coast,  and the battle \"on the waste sand by the waste sea.\" Moments of fire  are succeeded by exquisite deeps of quietude, and the death and  apotheosis of Arthur are hinted with daring and complete equivalence  of art with need.    Here is no longer the tinkle and swirl of the elf dances; here is no  more of the tireless search for novelty in movement and color. This is  \"a flash of the soul that can.\" Here is Beethoven _redivivus_. For  half a century we have had so much pioneering and scientific  exploration after piano color and tenderness and fire, that men have  neglected its might and its tragic powers. Where is the piano-piece  since Beethoven that has the depth, the breadth, the height of this  huge solemnity? Chopin's sensuous wailing does not afford it.  Schumann's complex eccentricities have not given it out. Brahms is too  passionless. Wagner neglected the piano. It remained for a Yankee to  find the austere peak again! and that, too, when the sonata was  supposed to be a form as exhausted as the epic poem. But all this is  the praise that one is laughed at for bestowing except on the graves  of genius.    The cautious Ben Jonson, when his erstwhile taproom roisterer, Will  Shakespeare, was dead, defied \"insolent Greece or haughty Rome\" to  show his superior. With such authority, I feel safe in at least  defying the contemporary schools of insolent Russia or haughty Germany  to send forth a better musicwright than our fellow townsman, Edward  MacDowell.      _Edgar Stillman Kelley._    [Illustration: EDGAR STILLMAN KELLEY.]    While his name is known wherever American music is known in its better  aspects, yet, like many another American, his real art can be  discovered only from his manuscripts. In these he shows a very  munificence of enthusiasm, scholarship, invention, humor, and  originality.    [Illustration: Autograph of Edgar Stillman Kelley]    Kelley is as thorough an American by descent as one could ask for, his  maternal ancestors having settled in this country in 1630, his  paternal progenitors in 1640, A.D. Indeed, one of the ancestors of  his father made the dies for the pine-tree shilling, and a  great-great-grandfather fought in the Revolution.    Kelley began his terrestrial career April 14, 1857, in Wisconsin. His  father was a revenue officer; his mother a skilled musician, who  taught him the piano from his eighth year to his seventeenth, when he  went to Chicago and studied harmony and counterpoint under Clarence  Eddy, and the piano under Ledochowski. It is interesting to note that  Kelley was diverted into music from painting by hearing \"Blind Tom\"  play Liszt's transcription of Mendelssohn's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\"  music. I imagine that this idiot-genius had very little other  influence of this sort in his picturesque career.    After two years in Chicago, Kelley went to Germany, where, in  Stuttgart, he studied the piano with Kruger and Speidel, organ with  Finck, composition and orchestration with Seiffritz. While in Germany,  Kelley wrote a brilliant and highly successful concert polonaise for  four hands, and a composition for strings.    In 1880 he was back in America and settled in San Francisco, with  whose musical life he was long and prominently identified as a  teacher and critic. Here he wrote his first large work, the well-known  melodramatic music to \"Macbeth.\" A local benefactor, John Parrot, paid  the expenses of a public performance, the great success of which  persuaded McKee Rankin, the actor, to make an elaborate production of  both play and music. This ran for three weeks in San Francisco to  crowded houses, which is a remarkable record for many reasons. A  shabby New York production at an ill-chosen theatre failed to give the  work an advantageous hearing; but it has been played by orchestras  several times since, and William H. Sherwood has made transcriptions  of parts of it for piano solo.    The \"Macbeth\" music is of such solid value that it reaches the dignity  of a flowing commentary. Beyond and above this it is an interpretation,  making vivid and awesome the deep import of the play, till even the  least imaginative auditor must feel its thrill.    Thus the gathering of the witches begins with a slow horror, which is  surely Shakespeare's idea, and not the comic-opera _can-can_ it is  frequently made. As various other elfs and terrors appear, they are  appropriately characterized in the music, which also adds mightily to  the terror of the murder scene. Throughout, the work is that of a  thinker. Like much of Kelley's other music, it is also the work of a  fearless and skilled programmatist, especially in the battle-scenes,  where it suggests the crash of maces and swords, and the blare of  horns, the galloping of horses, and the general din of huge battle.  Leading-motives are much used, too, with good effect and most  ingenious elaboration, notably the _Banquo_ motive. A certain amount  of Gaelic color also adds interest to the work, particularly a  stirring Gaelic march. The orchestration shows both scholarship and  daring.    An interesting subject is suggested by Kelley's experience in hunting  out a good motif for the galloping horses of \"Macbeth.\" He could find  nothing suitably representative of storm-hoofed chargers till his  dreams came to the rescue with a genuinely inspired theme. Several  other exquisite ideas have come to him in his sleep in this way; one  of them is set down in the facsimile reproduced herewith. On one  occasion he even dreamed an original German poem and a fitting musical  setting.    Dr. Wm. A. Hammond, in his book on \"Sleep and Its Derangements,\" is  inclined to scout the possibility of a really valuable inspiration in  sleep. He finds no satisfactory explanation for Tartini's famous  \"Devil's Sonata\" or Coleridge' proverbial \"Kubla Khan.\" He takes  refuge in saying that at least the result could not be equal to the  dreamer's capabilities when awake; but Kelley's \"Macbeth\" music was  certainly an improvement on what he could invent out of the land of  Nod.    After composing a comic opera, which was refused by the man for whom  it was written because it was too good, he drifted into journalism,  and wrote reviews and critiques which show a very liberal mind capable  of appreciating things both modern and classic.    Kelley was again persuaded to write a comic opera to the artistic  libretto, \"Puritania,\" by C.M.S. McLellan, a brilliant satirist,  who has since won fortune by his highly successful and frequently  artistic burlesquery. The work won excellent praise in Boston, where  it had one hundred performances. The work musically was not only  conscientious, but really graceful and captivating. It received the  most glowing encomiums from people of musical culture, and largely  enhanced Kelley's musical reputation in its run of something over a  year. On its tour Kelley was also the musical conductor, in which  capacity he has frequently served elsewhere.    Kelley plainly deserves preeminence among American composers for his  devotion to, and skill in, the finer sorts of humorous music. No other  American has written so artfully, so happily, or so ambitiously in  this field. A humorous symphony and a Chinese suite are his largest  works on this order.    The symphony follows the life of \"Gulliver in Lilliput.\" In  development and intertwining of themes and in brilliance of  orchestration, it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#6)"],[1,"to do it by compulsion; others by flattery. Some  think it is to be accomplished by set lessons, in spite of example;  others by example alone.    A certain father who was deeply convinced of the importance of forming  his sons to habits of industry, used to employ them whole days in  removing and replacing heaps of stones. This was well intended, and  arose from regarding industry as a high accomplishment; but there is  some danger of defeating our own purpose in this way, and of producing  _disgust_. Besides this, labor enough can usually be obtained which is  obviously profitable.    All persons, without exception, ought to labor more or less, every day  in the open air. Of the truth of this opinion, the public are beginning  to be sensible; and hence we hear much said, lately, about manual labor  schools. Those who, from particular circumstances, cannot labor in the  open air, should substitute in its place some active mechanical  employment, together with suitable calisthenic or gymnastic exercises.    It is a great misfortune of the present day, that almost every one is,  by his own estimate, _raised above his real state of life_. Nearly  every person you meet with is aiming at a situation in which he shall  be exempted from the drudgery of laboring with his hands.    Now we cannot all become '_lords_' and '_gentlemen_,' if we would.  There must be a large part of us, after all, to make and mend clothes  and houses, and carry on trade and commerce, and, in spite of all that  we can do, the far greater part of us must actually _work_ at  something; otherwise we fall under the sentence; 'He who will not  _work_ shall not _eat_.' Yet, so strong is the propensity to be  _thought_ 'gentlemen;' so general is this desire amongst the youth of  this proud money making nation, that thousands upon thousands of them  are, at this moment, in a state which may end in starvation; not so  much because they are too _lazy_ to earn their bread, as because they  are too _proud_!    And what are the _consequences_? A lazy youth becomes a burden to those  parents, whom he ought to comfort, if not support. Always aspiring to  something higher than he can reach, his life is a life of  disappointment and shame. If marriage _befall_ him, it is a real  affliction, involving others as well as himself. His lot is a thousand  times worse than that of the common laborer. Nineteen times out of  twenty a premature death awaits him: and, alas! how numerous are the  cases in which that death is most miserable, not to say ignominious!      SECTION IV. _On Economy._    There is a false, as well as a true economy. I have seen an individual  who, with a view to economy, was in the habit of splitting his wafers.  Sometimes a thick wafer can be split into two, which will answer a very  good purpose; but at others, both parts fall to pieces. Let the success  be ever so complete, however, all who reflect for a moment on the value  of time, must see it to be a losing process.    I knew a laboring man who would hire a horse, and spend the greater  part of a day, in going six or eight miles and purchasing half a dozen  bushels of grain, at sixpence less a bushel than he must have given  near home. Thus to gain fifty cents, he subjected himself to an  expense, in time and money, of one hundred and fifty. These are very  common examples of defective economy; and of that 'withholding' which  the Scripture says 'tends to poverty.'    Economy in time is economy of money--for it needs not Franklin to tell  us that time is equivalent to money. Besides, I never knew a person who  was economical of the one, who was not equally so of the other. Economy  of time will, therefore, be an important branch of study.    But the study is rather difficult. For though every young man of common  sense knows that an hour is _sixty minutes_, very few seem to know that  sixty minutes make an hour. On this account many waste fragments of  time,--of one, two, three or five minutes each--without hesitation, and  apparently without regret;--never thinking that fifteen or twenty such  fragments are equal to a full hour. 'Take care of the pence, the pounds  will take care of themselves,' is not more true, than that hours will  take care of themselves, if you will only secure the minutes.[1]    In order to form economical habits, several important points must be  secured. You must have for every _purpose_ and _thing_ a _time_, and  _place_; and every thing must be done _at the time_, and all things put  _in their place_.    1. _Every thing must be done at the time._ Whether you attempt little  or much, let every hour have its employment, in business, study, social  conversation, or diversion; and unless it be on extraordinary  occasions, you must not suffer your plan to be broken. It is in this  way that many men who perform an incredible amount of business, have  abundant leisure. And it is for want of doing business systematically  that many who effect but little, never find much leisure. They spend  their lives in literally 'doing nothing.'    An eminent prime minister of Holland was asked how he could perform  such a vast amount of business, as it was known he did, and yet have so  much leisure. 'I do every thing at the time;' was the reply.    Some of you will say you have no room for any plan of your own; that  your whole time is at the will of your master, or employer. But this is  not so. There are few persons who are so entirely devoted to others as  not to have minutes, if not hours, every day, which they can call their  own. Now here it is that character is tried and proved. He alone who is  wise in small matters, will be wise in large ones. Whether your  unoccupied moments amount in a day to half an hour, or an hour, or two  hours, have something to do in each of them. If it be social  conversation, the moment your hour arrives, engage in it at once; if  study, engage at once in that. The very fact that you have but a very  few minutes at your command, will create an interest in your employment  during that time.    Perhaps no persons read to better purpose than those who have but very  little leisure. Some of the very best minds have been formed in this  manner. To repeat their names would be to mention a host of self  educated men, in this and in other countries. To show what can be done,  I will mention one fact which fell under my own observation. A young  man, about fifteen years of age, unaccustomed to study, and with a mind  wholly undisciplined, read Rollin's Ancient History through in about  three months, or a fourth of a year; and few persons were ever more  closely confined to a laborious employment than he was during the whole  time. Now to read four such works as Rollin in a year, is by no means a  matter to be despised.    2. _Every thing should have its place._ Going into a shop, the other  day, where a large number of persons were employed, I observed the  following motto, in large letters, pasted on the side of the room; 'Put  every thing in its proper place.' I found the owner of the shop to be a  man of order and economy.    An old gentleman of my acquaintance, who always had a place for every  thing, made it a rule, if any thing was out of its place, and none of  his children could find it, to blame the whole of them. This was an  unreasonable measure, but produced its intended effect. His whole  family follow his example; they have a place for every thing, and they  put every thing in its place.    Unless both the foregoing rules are observed, true economy does not and  cannot exist. But without economy, life is of little comparative value  to ourselves or others. This trait of character is _generally_ claimed,  but more _rarely_ possessed.          [1] A teacher, who has been pleased to say much in behalf of this        work, and to do much to extend its circulation, in a late letter,        very modestly, but properly makes the following inquiry; 'Has not        Dr. Franklin's precept, _time is money_, made many misers? Is it        not used without sufficient qualification?'          There is no good thing, nor any good advice, but what may be        abused, if used or taken _without qualification_. There may be        misers in regard to time, as well as money; and no one can become        miserly in the one respect without soon becoming so in the other.        He who cannot or rather will not give any portion of his time to        promote the happiness of those around him, in the various ways of        doing good, which perpetually offer, lest it should take from his        means of earning property, is as much to be pitied as he who        hoards all his dollars and cents. Still it is true that youth        should husband well their time, and avoid wasting either that or        their money.      SECTION V. _Indolence._    One of the greatest obstacles in the road to excellence, is indolence.  I have known young men who would reason finely on the value of time,  and the necessity of rising early and improving every moment of it.  Yet I have also known these same _aspiring_ young men to lie dozing,  an hour or two in the morning, after the wants of nature had been  reasonably, and more than reasonably gratified. You can no more rouse  them, with all their fine arguments, than you can a log. There they  lie, completely enchained by indolence.    I have known others continually complain of the shortness of time; that  they had no time for business, no time for study, &c. Yet they would  lavish hours in yawning at a public house, or hesitating whether they  had better go to the theatre or stay; or whether they had better get  up, or indulge in 'a little more slumber.' Such people wear the most  galling chains, and as long as they continue to wear them there is no  reasoning with them.    An indolent person is scarcely human; he is half quadruped, and of the  most stupid species too. He may have good intentions of discharging a  duty, while"]]]
