I think you're just the worst ever!\" shrieked Martha,  and then ran downstairs to join those below.    In the meantime, Jack had torn open the letter and was scanning it  hastily.    \"Don't be selfish!\" burst out Fred, curiously. \"If Gif has anything to  say about that school, let us hear it.\"    \"Sure. I'll read it out loud,\" answered his cousin.    The communication, which was a rather long one, was of the usual boyish  type, and much of it was of no particular interest. Several paragraphs,  however, may be quoted here.                         *      *      *      *      *    \"You will be interested to know that besides Spouter Powell there will  be another boy here who may or may not join our set. The fellow's name  is Walter Baxter, and he is the son of Dan Baxter, the man who, years  ago, caused your father and your uncles so much trouble at Putnam Hall  and other places. Baxter is very hot-tempered and willing to fight  almost any time.    \"When I get back to school I am going in for athletics, particularly  football this Fall, and I hope some of you fellows will want to go into  athletics, too, for it will make it more interesting to have some  friends on the eleven. Spouter don't go in for that sort of thing. He  likes to save his wind for talk.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    \"Hum! that's rather interesting,\" was Randy's comment. \"I wonder if  this Walt Baxter will try to make trouble for us like his father did  for our fathers?\"    \"Well, if he does, I guess we can take care of him, just as our folks  took care of his father,\" returned his twin.    \"No use borrowing trouble,\" came from Fred. \"I've heard from my dad  that Mr. Dan Baxter has reformed and is now a first-class business man  and is quite prosperous. It may be that while his son Walt is somewhat  hot-tempered, he may still be a thoroughly good fellow. I wouldn't give  a rap for a boy that didn't show some spirit once in a while.\"    On the following morning Jack was on the point of going over to Fred's  house to return some books he had borrowed, when his father called to  him.    \"I want you to go down to our offices with me this morning, Jack,\" said  Dick Rover. \"I've got a package there that I meant to bring up for your  mother. You can come right back with it.\"    \"All right, Dad. I'll be with you in a minute,\" answered the son, and  ran off to deliver the books and to let Fred, as well as Randy and  Andy, know where he was going.    Jack's temperament was a good deal like that of his father, and, young  as he was, he already took an interest in what was being done in the  offices of The Rover Company. On more than one occasion he had begged  his parent's permission to visit the place on Wall Street, and once had  been granted a \"look-in\" at the Stock Exchange during one of its  busiest sessions. That sight was one he had never forgotten.    When the Rovers had first opened up in Wall Street, they had taken  possession of a set of rather shabby offices formerly occupied by  another firm with which they had had various difficulties, the  particulars of which were related in \"The Rover Boys in New York\" and  \"The Rover Boys in Business.\" Now, however, they occupied the entire  fourth floor of another building in a much better location. There was a  large general office and a counting room, and a private office for each  of the three brothers. Their office help numbered about twenty; and  when business was brisk, the place consequently was a decidedly busy  one.    When the offices of The Rover Company were reached, Dick Rover brought  out the package intended for his wife. It was quite a bundle, and not  wrapped as well as it might have been.    \"You'd better let the office boy put an extra string around that,  Jack,\" said the father.    \"Oh, that's all right, Dad. I can get it home just as it is. There  won't be much of a crowd on the subway train going uptown this time of  day.\"    Jack spent a few minutes in the offices, speaking to the office boy and  to several of the clerks with whom he was acquainted, and then started  off for home, the bundle under his arm. He came down by one of the  several elevators to the lower corridor of the building, and there  stood in the wide-open doorway, contemplating the bustle in the narrow  street beyond. Wall Street is the financial heart of our nation, and  the activity there during business hours is something tremendous.    As Jack stood with his bundle under his arm, his attention was suddenly  attracted to what was going on close by, beyond several columns which  formed a part of the entrance to the building. In a niche of the wall  stood a peddler, a short, sallow-faced and hollow-eyed man, evidently  of foreign birth, trying to sell some cheap wares displayed on a little  three-legged stand which he had set up. In front of the peddler stood a  tall, slim, overbearing boy, loudly dressed and wearing light-colored  spats and gloves to match.    \"You've got no right to plank yourself here!\" cried the overbearing boy  savagely. \"You get out of here or I'll dump that trash of yours into  the street.\"    \"Please, Mister, I am a poor man,\" pleaded the peddler in very broken  English. \"Please, Mister, you buy somet'in'?\"    \"You get out, I tell you!\" went on the tall youth with a very lordly  air. \"Get out, I tell you! You foreigners are all thieves! Get out of  here!\" And without further warning he caught the thin, little peddler  by the shoulder and gave him such a shove that the man had all he could  do to keep from falling and from upsetting his little stock in trade.          CHAPTER V    GETTING READY TO LEAVE      \"The mean fellow!\"    Such was Jack's exclamation as he witnessed the scene between the  hollow-eyed little street peddler and the dudish, overbearing youth who  had attacked him.    \"Get out, I tell you!\" repeated the overbearing boy, as the peddler  straightened up and caught hold of his little stand to keep it from  tumbling over. \"I've a big mind to kick your stuff into the street for  you.\"    \"Let up there, you big boob!\" cried Jack, and without stopping to think  twice he leaped towards the other youth and caught him firmly by the  arm.    The boy who had attacked the peddler had not expected such  interference, and he whirled around greatly surprised, especially when  he saw a boy smaller than himself confronting him.    \"What--what do you mean by catching hold of me this way?\" he stammered.    \"Why can't you leave that poor peddler alone?\" retorted Jack.    \"What business is this of yours?\"    \"That chap wasn't doing any harm here so far as I can see. He's only  trying to earn his living.\"    \"See here, kid! this is none of your affair, and I want you to keep out  of it,\" stormed the dudish-looking youth. \"We don't allow those fellows  around this building.\"    \"Then you tell him to move on in a decent kind of way,\" returned Jack.    \"I'll do as I please.\" The big boy turned again towards the peddler and  made a motion as if to push both the man and his stand down, but,  instantly, Jack caught hold of him again and pulled him back, shoving  him in between two pillars of the building's entrance.    \"You had better go on,\" said Jack to the peddler, and, evidently much  frightened by what was occurring, the little man took up his stand and  disappeared as if by magic in the crowd on the street.    \"Say! you've got gall to interfere with me!\" burst out the big youth,  glaring at Jack. \"I'll teach you a lesson;\" and with a sudden move he  pulled Jack's bundle from under his arm and threw it out into the  street. \"Now you go about your business and don't you interfere with me  again.\"    To have the bundle belonging to his mother treated in that fashion made  the young Rover's blood boil. He jumped at the big youth, and as the  other aimed a blow at him he dodged and then caught his opponent by the  ear.    \"Ouch! Let go!\" screamed the big youth in sudden pain, and then he  landed a blow on Jack's shoulder and received a crack on the chin in  return.    How far this encounter might have gone, it is hard to say, but at that  moment, while a crowd was beginning to gather, there came a sudden  interruption in the appearance of Jack's Uncle Tom, followed by his  Uncle Sam.    \"Hello! What does this mean?\" demanded Tom Rover, as he stepped between  the two boys.    \"It means that I've got an account to settle with that young snip, Mr.  Rover!\" cried the big youth savagely and giving Jack a look full of  hatred.    \"Uncle Tom, that fellow is nothing but a brute,\" declared Jack.    \"A brute? What do you mean?\"    \"He just attacked a poor little peddler who was trying to sell a few  things from a stand here in the corner. He tried to knock the peddler  down and upset his stand. I told him to stop and then he attacked me.\"    \"Humph! Are you this boy's uncle, Mr. Rover?\" asked the big youth, in  surprise.    \"I am, Martell.\"    \"Then I want to tell you that he has no right to interfere with me,\"  went on Napoleon Martell, uglily. \"Those peddlers are always hanging  around here and my opinion is they are all thieves.\"    \"That fellow was no more a thief than you are,\" broke in Jack,  sturdily.    \"Ha! Do you mean to call me a thief?\"    \"Come, Jack, such talk won't do down here in Wall Street,\" remonstrated  his Uncle Sam, who had listened closely to what had been said. Sam  Rover, from a distance, had seen the bundle flung into the gutter and  had picked it up. Both the wrapping and the string were broken, but the  contents of the package seemed to be uninjured.    \"If that kid is your nephew, you had better take him in hand,\" grumbled  Napoleon Martell, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#6)"],[1," fidgeting  as they bunched close together, only a yard or two from where I lay.    I wondered if lions were prowling near, but could hear or see nothing.  The air was hot and stifling, and there was none of the pleasant  coolness usual to even these summer nights in the desert, and on  climbing to the crest of the dune to look vainly towards where Inyati  must be wandering, I saw that the sky in that direction was heavy with  clouds; and even as I looked, flash after flash of lightning rent their  heavy pall.    \"Thank God!\" was my first thought, \"there will be rain there, and if  the pans lie there, we shall find water.\"    I stood and watched for some time, and saw that the storm was traveling  towards me, but it was still far distant, and I returned to the fire  and again tried to sleep, for the moon would not rise for several  hours, and Inyati had said he could not be back before then.    And this time I slept, a heavy sleep full of distorted dreams.    At length I awoke with a start, just as a gust of wind caught the fire  and scattered the embers in all directions. Another and another  followed, each more violent than the preceding one, then came a  terrific blast that whirled the blanket I had been lying on away into  the night: the last firebrand was snatched up as though by an unseen  hand, and borne high over the dune, and before I had time to realize  what was happening I was fighting for my life in the howling darkness  of a terrific sandstorm. The wind was demoniacal; it apparently blew  from all quarters at once, in short, sharp, incessant gusts, lifting  and whirling away everything that came in its path, shifting the loose  sand in such masses, and hurling it with such force that to stand still  would have meant being buried. Luckily the scanty vegetation where we  had rested had somewhat bound the sand, but in a few minutes of the  awful struggle I realized that unless I could reach some firmer spot I  must be overwhelmed. A momentary lull showed me the horses half buried,  and apparently too stupefied to do more than stand passively awaiting  their fate.    The salt pan! That was my only chance: there, at least, the very ground  would not dissolve beneath my feet, as it was doing here! And I must  make for it at once, for the whirling cataclysm of sand was again  closing upon me. Seizing the horses I cut their hobbles, and throwing  one of the packs across the nearest I coaxed and dragged him from the  sand. I had my rifle, and I had no time for anything else, but made off  in the direction of the pan, barely fifty yards away; but so terrible  was now the force of the wind that I was hard put to it to reach it,  and thankful indeed was I when a brief lull showed me the wide expanse  of white spreading dimly before me in the murk.    Even here the ever-recurring whirlwinds bore huge volumes of sand  eddying across the pan, and at times I feared I should be choked and  overwhelmed, but as I gradually neared the centre the air grew clearer,  and I knew that for the time, at least, I was safe.    The horses had struggled out after their leader, and stood trembling  near me; luckily I had left them saddled and bridled in anticipation of  an early start, but the other pack was lying there in the dunes. And  thus I awaited the abatement of the storm, a prey to the most awful  suspense.    Inyati! There in the distant dunes if the storm had caught him in their  midst he must be dead, overwhelmed and buried in the chaos of sand! Or  had he been able to gain one of the pans first; and would the abatement  of the storm see him return to me?    Hour after hour I waited, and still it raged; the time for moonrise was  long since past, though no gleam of its waning light could break  through the whirling pall around me. Moonrise! That had been the time  Inyati had hoped to return by, should he find water in the first pan;  but where was he now, battling for his life among the dunes, or dead  beneath them?    At length day dawned; and with the light the storm ceased as suddenly  as it had begun, though still huge clouds of dust hung all around,  through which the rising sun gleamed red and ray-less, as through a  thick fog.    Soon not a breath of wind remained, and the dust rapidly settling,  disclosed the tossed and distorted wilderness through which the storm  had raged.    At no great distance from me, and, as I judged, in the direction of the  spot at which the storm had overtaken me, a gigantic dune lay piled  high above the others. This was some of the devilish work of the past  night, for it had not been there yesterday!    There appeared no likelihood of a return of the storm; and, full of  anxiety and distress, I made my way to this newly-formed dune, which  apparently covered the exact spot of our camp of overnight; but now no  vestige of bush remained in sight anywhere: it was all buried fathoms  deep in sand. And gone too were many of our belongings, for with the  exception of the one pack-saddle, to which one of the water-skins was  providentially made fast, I had had no time to pick up anything; and  now the half of our precious water, and much of our stores and  ammunition, were covered by the thousands of tons of the gigantic dune.  Search as I could, in all directions, I could find no trace of them,  they had gone irretrievably; and gaze as I could from the highest point  of the new dune I could see no sign of life, and the sad conviction was  forced upon me that Inyati had perished, and that I was alone.        CHAPTER IV        THE PANS AND THE POISON FLOWERS         By this time the sun was high in the heavens, and I realized that if I  would make a bid for life I must do it soon. Buffeted and almost choked  with the battle of the past night, I was parched with thirst, and had  perforce to encroach upon the scanty store left to me a bare quart at  the outside; barely sufficient to keep life in me another day in the  terrible heat. The horses, too, were suffering and would scarcely last  that time, and I was now faced with the terrible problem as to whether  I should attempt to return or to penetrate farther into the desert. To  return would be difficult, for the storm had passed that way and all  our spoors would be obliterated; moreover, we had gone out of our path  so far when following the fire that I was by no means certain as to the  absolute direction. Moreover, a glance that way showed me heavy, dun-  colored clouds on the far horizon: there the storm was raging still,  and I shuddered to think of what my fate might be in the loose bare  dunes we had passed through with such difficulty. Besides, though  Inyati's awful fate appeared but too certain, I felt impelled to follow  the direction he had gone for there might, after all, be a faint hope  that he had lived through the storm. But this alternative was a  terrible one, for even if water had existed in the pans for which he  was searching, it was all too probable that the storm would have filled  up every pit with sand, and to penetrate so far would make return  impossible. However, I could not remain where I was and die without a  struggle; so, dividing the load as well as possible among the almost  exhausted animals, I again entered the maze of dunes and struck due  east, full of forebodings as to my own possible fate, and of sorrow for  that of poor Inyati. For hours I stumbled through the bewildering mass  of broken and barren dunes, finding no trace of vegetation, and full of  apprehension lest the wind should rise before I reached the pan; in  which case I was doomed. At long length, and when the afternoon was  well advanced, a flat dark space showed between two dunes some distance  ahead, and an hour later I stood upon the pan. No salt pan this time,  but a flat, circular floor of dry mud, hard and entirely free from the  surrounding sand. Here and there a few stunted bushes grew, and in the  centre of the circle which was about a mile across stood a huge herd of  gemsbok. They made off at a canter as I rode wearily across to the  depression in the centre where I hoped to find water. But the shallow,  hoof-trampled hollow was bone-dry; there was no sign of Inyati either,  and my heart sank as I realized that my struggle had been in vain.  Anyway, here I must rest and eat, and drink a little of my tiny stock  of water, and on the morrow make my last struggle on foot, for it was  evident that the horses could go no further, and were dying of thirst.  I threw off their light loads, and they stood with drooping heads and  ears, the picture of dejection. A mouthful of water was all I dare  drink, and there remained less than a pint in the water-skin. Almost  stupefied, exhausted, and despondent, I lay down beside a tiny bush, at  whose dry twigs the famished horses were now trying to nibble, and sank  into a state of half sleep, half stupor.    The sound of a shot aroused me from my lethargy had I been dreaming? No  there it was again; and now across the pan came streaming back the herd  of gemsbok, and after them ran and stumbled a nude black figure, that  now and again paused to single out an animal and shoot.    \"Inyati! Inyati! Thank God!\" I cried out, for it could be no other; and  as fast as my aching limbs allowed I hastened towards him. Now he was  down beside one of the fallen animals, and his knife was at work; and  now I realized why he had picked his victims, and had shot so many. It  was not food he wanted, but drink, and he had shot only the cows, whose  udders were full of rich sweet milk. It was time, too, that he drank,  for he could not speak, and his cracked and swollen lips and blood-shot  eyes told a tale of awful suffering.    Soon, however, he was able to talk. \"The storm, master,\" he said; \"near  was I to being buried alive and I thought thee dead! Yet, could I not  return before, for I have found no water. The other pan is dry also,  but now I have seen from far off a spot where water is, and so I  "]]]
