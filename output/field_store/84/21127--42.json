By the time of the actual expulsion (13th       July, 1559) the community had been reduced by deaths and       migrations to \"three priests and one young man,\" who would seem       to have conformed, in preference to leaving the country.       (_Vide_ \"The Elizabethan Religious Settlement,\" ch. iv, by Dom       H. N. Birt, O.S.B.)         For the general history of the Black Friars the reader is       referred to Archbishop Alemany's \"Life of St. Dominic, with a       Sketch of the Dominican Order,\" the \"Etudes sur l'Ordre de St.       Dominique\" by D'Anzas, and \"The Coming of the Friars\" by Dr.       Aug. Jessopp. The \"Chronica Majora\" of Matthew Paris afford       some lively reading on the subject.    [12] It is possible that investigations now pending may involve       a slight rearrangement of this conjectural plan, as those       previously drawn have similarly been modified from time to time       by fresh discoveries.    [13] This suggestion of Bishop Grindal's recalls the case of       Beaulieu Abbey where the beautiful refectory is still preserved       as the parish church.    [14] The church had been \"restored\" in 1789 by Mr. George       Dance, architect to the hospital, in a spirit which may be       inferred from the description of the interior given above. A       more sympathetic restoration was inaugurated by Mr. Philip       Hardwick in 1823.    [15] When the church was repaired by Mr. John Blyth in 1836,       this painting was removed, and a range of columns, bearing       small semicircular arches, substituted for it as a reredos.       During these alterations it was discovered that the stone wall       (erected by de Walden) between the wooden altar-piece and the       original apse, was painted in bright red tempera, sprinkled       with black stars. $$ The above-mentioned letters are attributed       to Mr. John Carter, but are merely signed by \"An Architect.\"    [16] It would probably be unfair to infer any unusual neglect       in spiritual matters from the architectural conditions. In       Paterson's \"Pietas Londinensis\" there is a list of public       services at many London churches, as held in the early part of       the eighteenth century. The services at St.       Bartholomew-the-Great are there quoted as \"Daily in the last       week in the month at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.,\" and at St.       Bartholomew-the-Less as \"Daily at 11 a.m.\"    [17] It should be stated that the fringe factory had covered       the remains of the crypt and Lady Chapel, besides projecting       some twenty feet into the east end of the church. The       architects for these earlier restorations were Professor Hayter       Lewis and Mr. Slater, who deserve credit for their careful       preservation of the old work.    [18] The obstruction on the south side of the triforium has       been already mentioned. The northern side was used for the       parochial boys' school for many years down to 1892, when the       scholars were transferred to the new schools built for them       adjoining the church.           *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: THE PRIORY CHURCH FROM THE WEST                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    [Illustration: VIEW FROM THE WEST                 _From a print of 1810_                 _W. Pearson del. W. Preston sc._]          CHAPTER II    THE EXTERIOR      The church lies in a general east and west direction, and, at the  present day, consists of the Choir and encircling Ambulatory, Lady  Chapel, north and south Transepts, with the lower stage of the central  Tower, one bay of the ancient Nave, three bays of the Cloister, and a  seventeenth-century brick Tower--the whole hidden behind the houses, in  an obscure corner of West Smithfield, by no means easy for a stranger to  discover. It will be well for him, therefore, in the first place, to  make his way to the better known buildings of St. Bartholomew's  Hospital, and then walk across the open square, between them and  Smithfield Market, to its eastern side, where he will find the entrance  close to the narrow street called Cloth Fair.    #The Gateway# is interesting, as a surviving fragment of the Early-English  period, supposed by some authorities to mark the site of the original  west front, of which they regard it as having formed part--the entrance  to the south aisle--which was allowed to stand, after the grand central  porch, and a corresponding doorway on the northern side, were destroyed  with the nave. More probable is the conjecture that it was merely the  entrance to the monastic enclosure, turned to account as a ready-made  structure when the work at the church was the reverse of constructive,  as it seems too large and too high for a mere doorway at the end of an  aisle, besides being rather too far from the church to agree with its  supposed dimensions. The modern iron gate is surmounted by a gilded  cross and the name of the church on a framework in the tympanum. The  arch is acutely pointed, and moulded in four orders, with a tooth  ornament in the hollows, and is in tolerably good condition; but the  supporting shafts have been superseded by a wall on each side, with the  circular moulded capitals (much decayed) above it, the bases either  being destroyed or buried in the earth beneath. The gateway is in a line  with the houses facing the public square, which touch it on both sides,  and are carried on without interruption above the opening.    When the floor of the church was lowered to its original level in  1863-6, the present approach to it was made by an excavation through the  churchyard, which covered the site of the nave, and is now walled off on  the northern side of the passage.    The gravestones are of comparatively modern date, and of no special  interest. A few of them have been left against the wall on the right,  where there is something of more antiquarian value in a collection of  _debris_ from the old building, containing the bases of some of the  Early-English columns in their original place, but hopelessly mutilated.    The existing #West Front# dates from the time when the nave was  destroyed. In 1893 a great improvement was made in its appearance by  refacing the wall with flint and stone, and otherwise ornamenting the  surface, to bring it into uniformity with the porch which was then built  at that end of the church. There are now three round-headed recesses in  the central portion of the wall, those at the extremities containing  narrow windows; a band of chequered stonework is carried across the  space beneath them, and a small circular window inserted above. It may  be mentioned here that the pointed arch has generally been adopted in  the new work, to distinguish it from the old, but the characteristic  massiveness and predominant scale of the original has been preserved  throughout the restoration. A practical illustration of these principles  will be seen in #The Porch#, as an ingenious compromise between the older  and newer types of architecture which are brought together in the main  fabric. It is built of a combination of flint and Portland stone, like  the wall-front just described, with which it is connected by a small  circular tower and an oblong extension on the northern side. The two  storeys of which it consists are divided externally by a band of  chequered diaper. The shallow arch of the doorway is simply moulded and  very slightly pointed, suggesting a transition from the Romanesque to  the Early-English style, while the Perpendicular is represented in the  battlements on the roof and the octagonal turret on the southern side.  In a niche above the apex of the arch, and on a bracket displaying the  Priory arms, upheld by two angels, stands a figure of Rahere, the  founder, with his left hand raised in benediction, and in his right a  model of the church. The design of this little edifice is taken from one  of the ancient seals (see Illustration in the Appendix), and shows the  central tower, with a round turret at each end, and a small building  (probably the original Lady Chapel) projecting from the east. Rahere's  features are copied from the effigy on his tomb, which is believed to be  an authentic portrait. The figure occupies the central position in the  higher storey, with three arched recesses on either side (the middle one  in each case containing a window), diminishing in height outwards, in  harmony with the lines of the roof. The ceiling within the porch is  groined in four divisions; and the \"priest's chamber\" above it makes a  convenient private room for the rector of the parish. This new porch  bears its own date (1893), and the date of the foundation, seven hundred  and seventy years earlier.[1]    #The Brick Tower#, built in 1628, is said to have been altered to some  extent in subsequent repairs, which have not improved its appearance. So  at least say the admirers of King Charles I, who argue that nothing  quite so hideous could have been erected in his reign. It is a plain  square structure, seventy-five feet in height, in four stages, gradually  diminishing in area upwards, the lower part supported by buttresses, and  the summit crowned by battlements, with a small bell-turret and vane.  More interesting than the tower itself--which is, in fact, an  incongruous addition to the church--are the #Bells# which it contains, a  precious inheritance from the Augustinian Canons, and in some respects  the most remarkable in London. The foundry stamp shows them to have been  cast by Thomas Bullisdon, who died about 1510. They are the smaller five  of a ring of twelve, six of which were sold at the Dissolution to the  Church of St. Sepulchre, Holborn, where they have since been re-cast,  and one has disappeared from history.

He had studied for the bar with no less diligence than at the  University; but in consequence of weakness of the chest, was obliged,  after his first circuit, to abandon the profession, in which, had health  allowed him, his success was certain. In 1835 he was placed upon the  commission of inquiry into the relief of the poor, (on the report of  which was founded the Irish Poor-law,) and the state of the Church in  Ireland; and afterward drew up an able report on the condition of the  Irish in Great Britain. In 1836 he was appointed, with Mr. John Austin,  a Commissioner to inquire into the Government of the Island of Malta,  especially as to its tariff and expenditure. The Commission laid an  elaborate report before Parliament, in accordance with the  recommendations of which, such reductions were made as rendered the  tariff of Malta one of the least restrictive in the world, and  materially extended its trade; and they succeeded in establishing the  freedom of the press in the island.    In January, 1839, Mr. Lewis was appointed a Poor-Law Commissioner, and  held the office until July, 1847; when, determining to enter Parliament,  he resigned, and was returned, with Mr. Joseph Bailey, Jr., and Mr.  Francis Wegg Prosser, both Conservatives and Protectionists, without  opposition, for Herefordshire. In November, 1847, he was appointed joint  secretary of the Board of Control, with Mr. James Wilson, M.P. for  Westbury, and early in the following year made his first speech in the  House, in opposition to a motion for the production of papers in the  case of the lately deposed Rajah of Sattara. In April, 1848, Mr. Lewis  was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, and was  succeeded in the secretaryship of the Board of Control by the Hon. John  E. Elliot, M.P. for Roxburghshire. In his present office Mr. Lewis has  served on the Smithfield Market Commission, appointed in November, 1849,  which has just brought up its report; and upon that subject, the Irish  Poor-Law, and Mr. Disraeli's motion as to local burdens, has spoken in  the House. Last year he brought forward a road bill to consolidate the  management of highways, and dispose of the question of turnpike trusts  and their advances. The bill was not proceeded with last session, and  has again been brought forward this year, with reference, however, only  to highways. Mr. Lewis has earned reputation as the translator of  \"Boukli's Public Economy of Athens,\" which, as well as the \"Dorians,\"  has become a textbook, and passed through a second edition; and is known  as author of an able essay on the \"Use and Abuse of Political Terms,\"  published in 1832; on the \"Origin and Formation of the Romance  Languages,\" published in 1835; on \"Local Disturbances in Ireland, and  the Irish Church Question,\" in 1836; on the \"Government of  Dependencies,\" in 1841; and \"On the Influence of Authority in Matters of  Opinion,\" in 1849.          ORIGINAL LETTER FROM DR. LAYARD UPON ANCIENT ART, &c.      We present in this number of the _International_ a communication from  the most celebrated traveler of the nineteenth century, AUSTEN HENRY  LAYARD, upon the sources of _Ancient Art_. It was addressed by the  distinguished author to his friend and ours, Mr. MINOR K. KELLOGG, the  well-known painter, who was for some time with DR. LAYARD in the East.           *       *       *       *       *    MY DEAR FRIEND:    I frequently wish that you were here with me; I could find you subjects  which would astonish you. However, I suppose you are desirous of hearing  something about my proceedings. When I said that the arts may have  passed from Egypt into Greece, I merely alluded to the popular opinion,  without adhering to it. It is not altogether improbable that they came  from another source. Phoenicia was too much of a trading province to  devote any great attention to the higher branches of the arts, and I am  not aware of any monuments existing which can be traced to that people,  and show a very high knowledge of architecture or sculpture. The designs  we have on their early coins, and particularly if the coins called \"the  unknown of Celicia,\" and those belonging to cities on the southern coast  of Asia Minor, were introduced by the Phoenician colonists, evidently  show that Phoenicia had borrowed from the Assyrians and not from the  Egyptians. Indeed, as their language and written character (for the  cuneiform, you must remember, appears only to have been a monumental  character, perhaps Semetic, like the hieroglyphics of Egypt), coincided  with those of the Assyrian, it is most probable that their sympathies  were with that people.    I assume that the language of the two nations was the same; this may  have been the case at one period, but whether throughout the existence  of the Assyrian empire, may be doubtful. At any rate, I believe the real  Assyrians and the Phoenicians, like all the nations occupying Syria  and Mesopotamia, to have been of the pure Semetic stock. I regret that I  have not time to make you a sketch of a bas-relief. A specimen of this  kind would at once show you how much nearer allied the arts of Greece  are with those of Assyria, than with those of Egypt. One thing appears  now to be pretty certain--that all Western Asia, Persia, Susiana, Media,  Asia Minor, &c. were fundamentally indebted to Assyria for their  knowledge of the arts. Persepolis is a mere copy of an Assyrian  monument, as far as the sculpture and ornaments are concerned, with the  addition of external architecture, of which, as far as I am yet able to  judge, the Assyrians appear to have been almost entirely ignorant.    There is no reason, therefore, to reject altogether the supposition that  the Arts may have been transmitted from Assyria, through Phoenicia,  into Greece, or, indeed, that the Arts may have passed into that country  through Asia Minor. The Assyrians, in the extreme elegance and taste  displayed in their ornaments, in their study of anatomy, and in their  evident attempts at composition, had much in common with the Greeks. I  think artists will be surprised when they see the collection of drawings  I have been able to make, and that one of the results of the discoveries  at Nimroud will be new views with regard to the early history of the  arts.    When I first came here, all the Arabs around told me that Nimroud was  built by Athur, or Assur, and that it was the ancient capital of  Assyria. Great faith may generally be placed in such traditions in the  East. In Mesopotamia, and in the country watered by the Tigris and  Euphrates, it is astonishing how names have been preserved, even when,  during Greek, Roman, or other dominion, other cities were built on the  site and named anew. The new names have long been lost, and the old are  this day to be found in the mouth of the Bedouin. I need only mention  Tadmor and Harran. In a religious point of view, there is no doubt that  much important information may be expected from a careful investigation  of the monuments of Assyria. During my labors, without being able to  devote much thought or attention to the subject, I have been continually  struck with the curious illustrations of little understood passages in  the Bible which these records afford. In an historical and archaeological  point of view, I know nothing more interesting and more promising than  the examination of the ruins of Assyria. One of the vastest empires that  ever existed--the power of whose king extended, at one period, over the  greater part of Assyria--whose advance in civilization and knowledge is  the theme of ancient historians--disappeared so suddenly from the face  of the earth, that it has left scarcely a trace, save its name, behind.  Even the names of its kings are not satisfactorily known, and out of the  various dynastic lists preserved, we are unable to select one worthy of  credit. As to their deeds, we have been in the most profound darkness,  and were it not for the record of their strength and greatness which we  find in the Scriptures, we should scarcely credit the few traditions  which the Greeks have preserved to us. After the lapse of two thousand  five hundred years, a mere chance has thrown their history in our way,  and we have now their deeds chronicled in writing and in sculpture.    Were I much given to the explanation of such things by a reference to  superhuman interference, I should be inclined to think that the Almighty  had designedly kept these monuments buried in the Earth, until the time  had arrived when man had sufficient leisure and knowledge to discover  the contents of records, written in an unknown character, that He might  prove to them how great was the power which He so suddenly destroyed,  and how fully the prophecies upon the subject were fulfilled. Had these  sculptures and inscriptions remained above ground, they would have  utterly disappeared long ere any records could have been made of their  former existence. Had they been casually discovered before the present  century, they would most probably have been used for cement in the  construction of the walls of a city. In fact, the moment for their  discovery has, in every way, been most propitious. However, I will not  enter into such speculations, but leave them to those who are that way  inclined. A. H.

MY DEAR FRIEND--It affords me much pleasure to write you from the midst  of the terrestrial paradise into which my romantic wanderings have at  length brought me.
