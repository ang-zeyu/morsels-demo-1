Frontier etiquette was different from Kentucky custom; it was  safer to be quiet when not sure.    \"Wal, thar's aplenty to see tonight, right enough. Me--I'm Crow Fenner; I  ride scout fur th' train. An' these here--they're Rennie's Pimas, what o'  'em is runnin' th' trail this trip.\"    So these were the famous Pima Scouts! No wonder they took their ease in  the Tubacca plaza. Every man, woman, and child in those adobe buildings  had reason to be thankful for their skill and cunning--the web of  protection Rennie's Pima Scouts had woven in this river valley.    \"I'm Kirby, Drew Kirby.\" He hastened to match one introduction with  another. \"This is my first time in the valley--\"    \"From th' east, eh?\"    \"Texas.\"    \"Texas....\" Something in the way Fenner repeated that made it sound not  like a confirmation but a question. Or was Drew overly suspicious? After  all, as Callie had agreed last night, the late Republic of Texas was a  very large strip of country, housing a multitude of native sons, from the  planting families of the Brazos to the ranchers in crude cabins of the  Brasado. There were Texans and Texans, differing greatly in speech,  manners, and background. And one did not ask intimate questions of a man  riding west of the Pecos. Too often he might have come hunting a district  where there was a longer distance between sheriffs. What a man volunteered  about his past was accepted as the truth.    \"Rode a far piece then,\" Fenner commented. \"Me, I've been trailin' round  this here country since th' moon was two-bit size. An' I ain't set my  moccasins on all o' it yet. Thar's parts maybe even an Injun ain't seed  neither. You jus' outta th' army, son?\"    Drew nodded. Apparently he could not escape that part of his past, and  there was no reason to deny it.    \"Iffen you be huntin' a job--_Don_ Cazar, he's always ready to hire on  wagon guards. Any young feller what knows how to handle a gun, he's  welcome--\"    \"Can't leave Tubacca, at least for now. Have me a mare over in the livery  that just foaled. I'm not movin' until she's ready to travel--\"    \"Must be right good stock,\" Fenner observed. \"Me, I has me a ridin' mule  as kin smell Apaches two miles off. Two, three times that thar mule saved  m' skin fur me. Got Old Tar when he turned up in a wild-hoss corral th'  mustangers set over in th' Red River country--\"    \"I saw him when you rode into town. Good-lookin' animal.\"    Crow Fenner nodded vigorously. \"Shore is, shore is. _Don_ Cazar, he's  partial to good stock--favors Tar, too. Th' _Don_ has him a high-steppin'  hoss every hoss thief in this here territory'd like to run off. Bright  yaller--\"    \"Saw that one, too. Unusual colorin' all right.\"    \"He put a white stud--white as milk--to run with some light buckskin mares  back 'fore th' war. First colt out of that thar breedin' was that Oro  hoss. Never got 'nother like him; he's special. Shows his heels good, too.  They's gonna race him out on th' flats tomorrow if anyone is fool 'nough  to say as he has a hoss as can beat Oro. Thar's always some greenhorn as  thinks he has--\"    \"Oh?\" Drew wondered aloud. The black-and-gold horse was beautiful and  plainly of good breeding. That he was also a runner was not out of the  question. But that Oro could best Gray Eagle-Ariel stock on the track,  Drew doubted. There were unbroken records set on eastern tracks by horses  in Shiloh's direct blood line. And the local talent that had been matched  against Oro in the past had probably not been much competition. The  Kentuckian began to speculate about a match between the gray stallion and  the horse foaled on the Arizona range.    \"Yep, we'll see some race, does anyone turn up with a hoss t' match Oro.\"    One of the shirted Indians rose to his feet. With rifle sloped over  forearm, he padded into the dark. Fenner's relaxed posture tensed into  alert readiness. His head turned, his attitude now one of listening  concentration. Drew strained to see or hear what lay beyond. But the noise  from the plaza and torchlight made a barrier for eye and ear.    Fenner's rifle barrel dropped an inch or so; he stood easy again. Drew  heard a jingle of metal, the creak of saddle leather, the pound of shod  hoofs.    \"Soldiers!\" Fenner sniffed. \"Wonder what they's doin', hittin' town now.  Wal, that ain't no hair off m' skull. Me, I'm gonna git Tar his treat.  Promised him some time back he could have a bait o' oats--oats an' salt,  an' jus' a smidgen o' corn cake. That thar mule likes t' favor his  stomach. Kells, he ought t' have them vittles put together right 'bout  now. This mare o' yourn what's so special, young feller.... Me, I'd like  t' see a hoss what's got to be took care of like she was a bang-up lady!\"    He put two fingers to his lips and whistled. A mule head, attached to a  rangy mule body, weaved forward to follow dog-at-heel fashion behind the  scout.    A squad of blue coats was riding in--an officer and six men. They threaded  their way to the cantina where the officer dismounted and went inside. The  troopers continued to sit their saddles and regard the scene about them  wistfully.    \"Looks like a duty patrol,\" Fenner remarked. \"Maybe Cap'n Bayliss. He's  gittin' some biggety idear as how it's up t' him t' police this here town.  Does he start t' crow too loud, _Don_ Cazar or Reese Topham'll cut his  spurs. Maybe he sets up th' war shield an' does th' shoutin' back thar in  front o' all them soldier boys. In this town he ain't no gold-lace  general!\"    \"Troops and the town not friendly?\" Drew asked.    \"Th' soldiers--they ain't no trouble. Some o' 'em have their heads screwed  on straight an' know what they's doin' or tryin' t' do. But a lot o' them  officers now--they come out here wi' biggety idears 'bout how t' handle  Injuns, thinkin' they knows all thar's t' be knowed 'bout fightin'--an'  them never facin' up to a Comanche in war paint, let alone huntin'  'Paches. 'Paches, they know this here country like it was part o' their  own bodies--can say 'Howdy-an'-how's-all-th'-folks, bub?' t' every lizard  an' snake in th' rocks. Ain't no army gonna pull 'em out an' make 'em  fight white-man style.    \"_Don_ Cazar--he goes huntin' 'em when they've come botherin' him an' does  it right. But he knows you think Injun, you live Injun, you eat Injun, you  smell Injun when you do. They don't leave no more trail than an ant  steppin' high, 'less they want you should foller them into a nice ambush  as they has all figgered out. Put Greyfeather an' his Pimas on 'em an'  then leg it till your belly's near meetin' your backbone an' you is all  one big tired ache. Iffen you kin drink sand an' keep on footin' it over  red-hot rocks when you is nigh t' a bag o' bones, then maybe--jus'  maybe--you kin jump an Apache. Comanches, now, an' Cheyenne an' Kiowa an'  Sioux ride out to storm at you--guns an' arrows all shootin'--wantin' to  count coup on a man by hittin' him personal. But th' 'Pache ain't wastin'  hisself that way. Nope--git behind a rock an' ambush ... put th' whole  hell-fired country t' work fur them. That's how th' 'Pache does his  fightin'. An' th' spit-an'-polish officers what come from eastward--they's  got t' larn that. Only sometimes they ain't good at larnin', an' then they  gits larned--good an' proper. Hey, Kells!\"    They were at the stable and Fenner lifted a hand, palm out, in greeting to  the liveryman. \"Here's Ole Tar wantin' his special grub--\"    Drew went on to Shiloh's stall. Reese Topham, the Spaniard _Don_ Lorenzo  who had been in the cantina last night, the stout Mexican Bartolome, and  _Don_ Cazar himself were all there before him.    \"Here he is now.\" Reese Topham waved a hand at Drew. \"This is Mister  Kirby, from Texas.\"    \"You have a fine horse there, Kirby--the mare, too. Eastern stock, I would  judge, perhaps Kentucky breeding?\" Rennie asked.    Drew was taut inside. To say the wrong thing, to admit the line of that  breeding, might be a bad slip. Yet he could only evade, not lie directly.    \"Yes, Kentucky.\" He answered the first words his father had ever addressed  to him.    \"And the line?\"    To be too evasive would invite suspicion. However, the Gray Eagle get was  in more than one Kentucky stable.    \"Eclipse....\" Drew set back the pedigree several equine generations.  Shiloh tossed his head, looked over his shoulder at Drew, who entered the  stall and began quieting the stallion with hands drawn gently over the  back and up the arch of the neck.    \"The mare also?\" _Don_ Cazar continued.    \"Yes.\" The Kentuckian's answer sounded curt in his own ears, but he could  not help it.    \"This Eclipse, _amigo_,\" _Don_ Lorenzo turned to Rennie for  enlightenment--\"he was a notable horse?\"    \"_Si_, of the Messenger line. But a gray of that breeding--\" _Don_ Cazar's  forefinger ran nail point along his lower lip. \"Ariel blood, perhaps?\"    Drew busied himself adjusting Shiloh's hackamore. This was getting close.  Hunt Rennie had lived in Kentucky over a year once. He had visited Red  Springs many times before he had dared to court Alexander Mattock's  daughter and been forbidden the place. His visits to the stable must have  familiarized him with the Gray Eagle-Ariel strain bred there. On the other  hand, horses of the same combination were the pride of several other  families living around Lexington.    \"A racing line of high blood,\" _Don_ Lorenzo said thoughtfully. \"_Si_,  this one has the pride, the appearance. You have raced him, _senor_?\" he  asked Drew with formal courtesy.    \"Not on any real track, _senor_. During the war there were no races.\"    \"He wasn't a cavalry mount?\" _Don_ Cazar looked surprised.    \"No, suh. Too young for that. He was foaled on April sixth in sixty-two.  That's why they called him Shiloh.\"    There was a moment of silence, broken "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20842"],[0,"Dreams (#6)"],[1," that, and by that alone,  that he is distinguished from the waking man.    From this essential difference can be drawn a great many others. We can  come to understand the chief characteristics of the dream. But I can  only outline the scheme of this study. It depends especially upon three  points, which are: the incoherence of dreams, the abolition of the sense  of duration that often appears to be manifested in dreams, and, finally,  the order in which the memories present themselves to the dreamer,  contending for the sensations present where they are to be embodied.    The incoherence of the dream seems to me easy enough to explain. As it  is characteristic of the dream not to demand a complete adjustment  between the memory image and the sensation, but, on the contrary, to  allow some play between them, very different memories can suit the same  sensation. For example, there may be in the field of vision a green spot  with white points. This might be a lawn spangled with white flowers. It  might be a billiard-table with its balls. It might be a host of other  things besides. These different memory images, all capable of utilizing  the same sensation, chase after it. Sometimes they attain it, one after  the other. And so the lawn becomes a billiard-table, and we watch these  extraordinary transformations. Often it is at the same time, and  altogether that these memory images join the sensation, and then the  lawn will be a billiard-table. From this come those absurd dreams where  an object remains as it is and at the same time becomes something else.  As I have just said, the mind, confronted by these absurd visions, seeks  an explanation and often thereby aggravates the incoherence.    As for the abolition of the sense of time in many of our dreams, that is  another effect of the same cause. In a few seconds a dream can present  to us a series of events which will occupy, in the waking state, entire  days. You know the example cited by M. Maury: it has become classic, and  although it has been contested of late, I regard it as probable, because  of the great number of analogous observations that I found scattered  through the literature of dreams. But this precipitation of the images  is not at all mysterious. When we are awake we live a life in common  with our fellows. Our attention to this external and social life is the  great regulator of the succession of our internal states. It is like  the balance wheel of a watch, which moderates and cuts into regular  sections the undivided, almost instantaneous tension of the spring. It  is this balance wheel which is lacking in the dream. Acceleration is no  more than abundance a sign of force in the domain of the mind. It is, I  repeat, the precision of adjustment that requires effort, and this is  exactly what the dreamer lacks. He is no longer capable of that  attention to life which is necessary in order that the inner may be  regulated by the outer, and that the internal duration fit exactly into  the general duration of things.    It remains now to explain how the peculiar relaxation of the mind in the  dream accounts for the preference given by the dreamer to one memory  image rather than others, equally capable of being inserted into the  actual sensations. There is a current prejudice to the effect that we  dream mostly about the events which have especially preoccupied us  during the day. This is sometimes true. But when the psychological life  of the waking state thus prolongs itself into sleep, it is because we  hardly sleep. A sleep filled with dreams of this kind would be a sleep  from which we come out quite fatigued. In normal sleep our dreams  concern themselves rather, other things being equal, with the thoughts  which we have passed through rapidly or upon objects which we have  perceived almost without paying attention to them. If we dream about  events of the same day, it is the most insignificant facts, and not the  most important, which have the best chance of reappearing.    I agree entirely on this point with the observation of W. Robert, of  Delage and of Freud. I was in the street, I was waiting for a  street-car, I stood beside the track and did not run the least risk. But  if, at the moment when the street-car passed, the idea of possible  danger had crossed my mind or even if my body had instinctively recoiled  without my having been conscious of feeling any fear, I might dream that  night that the car had run over my body. I watch at the bedside of an  invalid whose condition is hopeless. If at any moment, perhaps without  even being aware of it, I had hoped against hope, I might dream that the  invalid was cured. I should dream of the cure, in any case, more  probably than that I should dream of the disease. In short, the events  which reappear by preference in the dream are those of which we have  thought most distractedly. What is there astonishing about that? The ego  of the dream is an ego that is relaxed; the memories which it gathers  most readily are the memories of relaxation and distraction, those which  do not bear the mark of effort.    It is true that in very profound slumber the law that regulates the  reappearance of memories may be very different. We know almost nothing  of this profound slumber. The dreams which fill it are, as a general  rule, the dreams which we forget. Sometimes, nevertheless, we recover  something of them. And then it is a very peculiar feeling, strange,  indescribable, that we experience. It seems to us that we have returned  from afar in space and afar in time. These are doubtless very old  scenes, scenes of youth or infancy that we live over then in all their  details, with a mood which colors them with that fresh sensation of  infancy and youth that we seek vainly to revive when awake.    It is upon this profound slumber that psychology ought to direct its  efforts, not only to study the mechanism of unconscious memory, but to  examine the more mysterious phenomena which are raised by \"psychical  research.\" I do not dare express an opinion upon phenomena of this  class, but I cannot avoid attaching some importance to the observations  gathered by so rigorous a method and with such indefatigable zeal by the  Society for Psychical Research. If telepathy influences our dreams, it  is quite likely that in this profound slumber it would have the greatest  chance to manifest itself. But I repeat, I cannot express an opinion  upon this point. I have gone forward with you as far as I can; I stop  upon the threshold of the mystery. To explore the most secret depths of  the unconscious, to labor in what I have just called the subsoil of  consciousness, that will be the principal task of psychology in the  century which is opening. I do not doubt that wonderful discoveries  await it there, as important perhaps as have been in the preceding  centuries the discoveries of the physical and natural sciences. That at  least is the promise which I make for it, that is the wish that in  closing I have for it.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Author's note (1913). This would be the place where  especially will intervene those \"repressed desires\" which Freud and  certain other psychologists, especially in America, have studied with  such penetration and ingenuity. (See in particular the recent volumes of  the _Journal of Abnormal Psychology_, published in Boston by Dr. Morton  Prince.) When the above address was delivered (1901) the work of Freud  on dreams (_Die Traumdeutung_) had been already published, but  \"psycho-analysis\" was far from having the development that it has  to-day.
