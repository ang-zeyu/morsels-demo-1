As the      feathers are long and glittering, this sort of blankets is      not only very warm, but pleasing to the eye.[30]    The extent and importance of the art among the Gulf tribes are indicated  by a number of early observers. The Knight of Elvas speaks of  the use of blankets by the Indians, 83 degrees west longitude, and 32  degrees north latitude, or near the central portion of Georgia:        These are like shawls, some of them are made from the inner      barks of trees, and others from a grass resembling nettle,      which, by threading out, becomes like flax. The women use      them for covering, wearing one about the body from the waist      downward, and another over the shoulder, with the right arm      left free, after the manner of the gypsies: the men wear but      one, which they carry over their shoulders in the same way,      the loins being covered with a bragueiro of deer-skin, after      the fashion of the woolen breech-cloth that was once the      custom of Spain. The skins are well dressed, the color being      given to them that is wished, and in such perfection, that,      when of vermilion, they look like very fine red broadcloth,      and when black, the sort in use for shoes, they are of the      purest. The same hues are given to blankets.[31]    At Cutifachiqui similar fabrics were observed:        In the barbacoas were large quantities of clothing, shawls of      thread, made from the barks of trees and others of feathers,      white gray, vermilion and yellow, rich and proper for      winter.[32]    The frequent mention of fabrics used by the Indians for shawls, mantles,  etc., makes it plain that such were in very general use when the town of  Pacaha was captured, and the Spaniards clothed themselves with mantles,  cassocks, and gowns made from these native garments. Everywhere woven  shawls were a principal feature of the propitiatory gifts of the natives  to the Spaniards.    The extent of this manufacture of hempen garments by the Indians of the  lower Mississippi is well indicated in the account of the adventures of  the expedition on the western side of the Mississippi at Aminoga. The  Spaniards undertook the construction of brigantines by means of which  they hoped to descend the Mississippi and to pass along the gulf coast  to Mexico. A demand was made upon the natives for shawls to be used in  the manufacture of sails, and great numbers were brought. Native hemp  and the ravelings of shawls were used for calking the boats.[33] What a  novel sight must have been this first European fleet on the great river,  consisting of five brigantines impelled by sails of native manufacture!    It is worthy of note that in this region (of the lower Mississippi) the  Spaniards saw shawls of cotton, brought, it was said, from the  west--probably the Pueblo country, as they were accompanied by objects  that from the description may have been ornaments of turquois.[34]    The following is from Du Pratz:        Many of the women wear cloaks of the bark of the      mulberry-tree, or of the feathers of swans, turkies, or India      ducks. The bark they take from young mulberry shoots that      rise from the roots of trees that have been cut down; after      it is dried in the sun they beat it to make all the woody      part fall off, and they give the threads that remain a second      beating, after which they bleach them by exposing them to the      dew. When they are well whitened they spin them about the      coarseness of pack-thread, and weave them in the following      manner: they plant two stakes in the ground about a yard and      a half asunder, and having stretched a cord from the one to      the other, they fasten their threads of bark double to this      cord, and then interweave them in a curious manner into a      cloak of about a yard square with a wrought border round the      edges. * * * The girls at the age of eight or ten put on a      little petticoat, which is a kind of fringe made of threads      of mulberry bark.[35]    This is illustrated farther on.    The manner of weaving in the middle and upper Mississippi country is  described by Hunter, who, speaking of the Osage Indians and their  neighbors, says:        The hair of the buffalo and other animals is sometimes      manufactured into blankets; the hair is first twisted by      hand, and wound into balls. The warp is then laid of a length      to answer the size of the intended blanket, crossed by three      small smooth rods alternately beneath the threads, and      secured at each end to stronger rods supported on forks, at a      short distance above the ground. Thus prepared, the woof is      filled in, thread by thread, and pressed closely together, by      means of a long flattened wooden needle. When the weaving is      finished, the ends of the warp and woof are tied into knots,      and the blanket is ready for use. In the same manner they      construct mats from flags and rushes, on which, particularly      in warm weather, they sleep and sit.[36]    Fabrics of various kinds were employed in burial, although not generally  made for that purpose. The wrappings of dead bodies were often very  elaborate, and the consignment of these to tombs and graves where the  conditions were favorable to preservation has kept them for long periods  in a most perfect state. By exhumation we have obtained most of our  information on this subject. Our knowledge is, however, greatly  increased by descriptions of such burial customs as were witnessed in  early times. Extracts already given refer to the use of fabrics in  mortuary customs. Many others could be cited but the following seems  sufficient:        After the dead person has lain a day and a night in one of      their hurdles of canes, commonly in some out house made for      that purpose, those that officiate about the funeral go into      the town, and the first young men they meet withal, that have      blankets or match coats on, whom they think fit for their      turn, they strip them from their backs, who suffer them so to      do without any resistance. In these they wrap the dead      bodies, and cover them with two or three mats which the      Indians make of rushes or cane; and, last of all, they have a      long web of woven reeds or hollow canes, which is the coffin      of the Indians, and is brought round several times and tied      fast at both ends, which, indeed, looks very decent and well.      Then the corps is brought out of the house into the orchard      of peach trees, where another hurdle is made to receive it,      about which comes all the relations and nation that the dead      person belonged to, besides several from other nations in      alliance with them; all which sit down on the ground upon      mats spread there for that purpose.[37]      NETS.    The manufacture and use of nets by natives in various parts of the  country are recorded by early writers, some of whom have already been  quoted. Speaking of the Iroquois De la Potherie says:        The old men and those who can not or do not wish to go to war      or the chase, make nets and are fishers. This is a plebian      trade among them. Their nets are made of thread of nettles or      of white wood, the bark of which they make into thread by      means of lye which renders it strong and pliable.[38]    In another place the same author says:        The Sauteurs, who are beyond the Missisakis, take their name      from a Saut (waterfall) which flows from Lake Superior into      Lake Huron by a great fall whose rapids are extremely      violent. These people are very skillful in fishery by which      they obtain white fish as large as salmons. They cross all      these terrible rapids into which they cast a net like a sack,      a little more than half an ell in width by one in depth      attached to a forked stick about 15 feet long.[39]    A novel use of nets is recorded by this author as follows:        For taking pigeons in summer in nets, they make a broad path      in the woods and attach to two trees, one on each side, a      large net made in the shape of a sack well opened.[40]    Du Pratz, speaking of the fishing nets of the Louisiana Indians, states  that they \"are meshed like ours and made of lime-tree bark; the large  fish are shot with arrows.\"[41]      FEATHER WORK.    Feather work was one of the most remarkable arts of the natives of  Mexico and other southern countries at the period of the conquest. The  feathers were sometimes woven in with the woof and sometimes applied to  a network base after the fashion of embroidery. Rarely, it may be  imagined, were either spun or unspun fabrics woven of feathers alone.  Very pleasing specimens of ancient Peruvian feather work are recovered  from graves at Ancon and elsewhere, and the method of inserting the  feathers is illustrated in the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of  Ethnology.[42] In few instances has such work been recovered from mounds  or burial places, but there can be no doubt that the mound-building  tribes were experts in this art. Frequent mention is made of the feather  work of the natives by the earliest explorers of the Mississippi valley,  and the character of the work may be gathered from the extracts already  given and from those which follow.    John Smith, speaking of the feather work of the Virginia Indians, says:        We haue seene some vse mantels made of Turky feathers, so      prettily wrought and woven with threads that nothing could be      discerned but the feathers.[43]    Lawson mentions a \"doctor\" of the Santee nation who \"was warmly and  neatly clad with a match coat, made of turkies feathers, which makes a  pretty show, seeming as if it was a garment of the deepest silk  shag.\"[44]    In another place the same author says:        Their feather match coats are very pretty, especially some of      them, which are made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#6)"],[1,"and prerogatives--some exalting the  Teuton supremacy of will, others urging and preparing the mental  ground for an armed attack on the world for a German dictatorship.  This militant literature was introduced here by Rudolph, who was  armed with strategic plans, diagrams, military maps, which the  family frequently of an evening pored over with the enthusiasm of a  parlor game. First it was Russia to be assaulted, then Belgium, and  always France.    \"Italy is already as good as conquered,\" Rudi proclaimed, \"and  England simply needs to be tilted off her worm-eaten perch by a  sudden shock.\"    Kirtley rubbed his eyes. What a widespread, horrible butchery was  being nursed and nourished here in this obscure family of peace?  Surely this good folk did not appreciate the meaning of it all. Was  it not merely something awfully exciting to talk about, argue about,  puzzle over, in the prosaic humdrum at this respectable hearthstone?    Such a strange form of social entertainment! The \"arsenal\" below  always came to Gard's mind. These people acted as if they were  actually thinking of capturing the whole Eastern Hemisphere,  speaking as if they were going to rule it like conquerors, going to  enforce at the point of the blade German \"might,\" \"will,\" \"rights.\"  These were the common expressions used. Kirtley thought the  household must be unbalanced on this topic.    He said to himself, \"No one else whom I have read or heard of is  contemplating such a campaign. Other races are holding forth on the  benefits and glories of peace. These Dresden Germans are talking of  the benefits and glories of war!\"    This example in these simple, every-day Buchers was most pointed.  Their lines were furthest from the military. Teaching diction and  phonetics to women and male singers, studying engineering, religion  and the gentle arts, had nothing to do with such proposed bloody  belligerence.    Only Rudi could be called somewhat martial. Hydraulics was his  branch, and his frequent absences on missions about which he assumed  an important and mystifying air, such as is, for that matter, usual  in bumptious young men, never caused any comment or visible interest  on the part of the others. He gave himself out to be close to the  _militaire_, familiar with its secrets, as he freely blew his  cigarette smoke across the meal table; and to him the family  deferred on these subjects. Surely all this was to Gard very  foreign and interesting.    \"What a different race of beings! What a curious revelation to  observe, what a doughty complex to comprehend!\"    He was more confounded by the attitude of the women. They were even  fiercer than the men. To them the other Europeans were a wholly bad  lot. Those neighbors were so much in the way of the good, all-worthy  Germans. But it was on the English that this feminine hatred vented  itself most turbulently. Frau Bucher shouted that she would be more  than glad--she would be hilarious--if war came.    \"I would wear my last rag for years, see my two boys dead on the  battle front, if Gross Britain could be knocked into the bottom of  the sea.\"    Was all this a part of that national gladness Gard was observing in  Germany and could not gage, could not yet give an explicit and  sufficient reason for? Those old-time Teuton liberals, masters of  prose and verse--how would they feel at home in this modern  Rhineland of hysterical spleen and arms provocative? Was it  possible he had really come on a sort of fool's errand?          CHAPTER VII    GERMAN LOVING      Fraeulein Elsa was a blooming, almost blue-eyed young woman of  twenty. Such a fresh, strawberry and cream complexion under a  plenteous harvest of flaxen hair would not be associated in America  with anyone very serious. _There_ she would have been thought  arrayed by Nature as a tearing blonde, suitable for the equivocal  light stage, or as a frivolous artist's model, or as promenade girl  in a suit and cloak house. But in Fraeulein the extraordinary  combination of volatile comeliness and unimpeachable earnestness  daily worked growing wonders in Kirtley.    It is a luckless young traveler who does not find himself or herself  engaged in some romance, permanent or transient, which ever after  sweetens or gilds the memories of the tour. Moreover Gard was at an  age when youthful susceptibilities were softened by the  lackadaisicalness of his returning state of health and hope.    So his difficulties with the German language, feasting, sleeping and  redoubtable ways in general, were to be complicated by German  loving. The shining object of his tenderness--how she was to lend  brightness to the short dismal days and long black nights of the  Teuton winter! At first he had asked himself:    \"Is a campaign of the heart in Deutschland as portentous, dreadfully  systematic, a proceeding as the other undertakings? Do the Germans  go at that sort of thing, too, hammer and tongs?\"    The glowing Fraeulein was able-bodied, full-chested, with every  golden promise of a rich maternityhood. Did American girls have  any bosoms to speak of? Gard seemed now to have never noticed that  feature in them. Yet bounding breasts are the unashamed pride of  German girls.    While the Yankee miss is often to be identified by complaints of a  physical nature, Elsa had no aches or pains to talk about. She had  a strength competent to support all her energetic, meritorious  endeavors. A thoroughly well woman--what an exceptional being, a  god-send! It is not the fashion with maids beyond the Rhine to be  ailing. Weak backs, nervous prostration, indigestion and similar  indispositions were not topics at the Buchers'. To be coquettishly  delicate or romantically ill is a liability to the Germans. Health,  unenchanting as it may be, is a prime asset. That the Teuton women  are gormands--what is that compared with their willingness to mother  six or more sturdy youngsters?    Had Frau Bucher been an Elsa at twenty? Yes, in the main, yet  impossible to conceive. Would Elsa become at fifty-five like her  parent? Heaven forbid! But Youth ignores such deterrent  probabilities.    The daughter and her manifold achievements easily bowled Gard over.  Was he in love or did he merely imagine he was? Was he filling with  the divine fire or only being smitten? Who could ever tell? And what  is, in fact, the practical difference? Kindly old Rebner had hinted  that it would not be amiss in Gard to bring home one of the  excellent German _maedchens_ with her brimming stock of health and  efficiency.    \"She would be an answer to our American servant girl question, flood  your fireside with invigorating music, and rear a house full of  robust children. It would be a novel and commendable experiment and  experience for you, Kirtley.\"    Of course Heine is the approved route with a German girl. Gard  borrowed from Fraeulein an old copy of the \"Buch der Lieder.\" Very  obliging at times like the rest of the family in the business of  improving his accent, she urged that if he would commit some of  those little prized poems to heart, she would supervise his  intonations. He eagerly betook himself to this charming exercise,  and it was not long before he was inviting her to walk along that  alluring path through the meadow by the persuasive water. Here he  repeated over and over to her the very pertinent lines,        Thou'rt like unto a flower,    and        Thou lov'st me not, thou lov'st me not,    under the conscientious reproofs of her engaging diction.    But never more than for half an hour at a time. This was all she  could spare him. Her days were very strictly divided by her pressing  concerns. A sightly young woman so tremendously busy--it was almost  exasperating.    And he could not establish any tender quality of relationship that  would warm a delectable exchange of rosy intimations or tentative  expressions of budding feelings of delight. It was teacher and  pupil. She unsuspectingly insisted on following her role of  preceptress and very earnest was she about it, too.    She saw nothing comical in his frequent linguistic stumblings that  would naturally lead to melting moods. As the Germans have, of  course, little humor, she found in these faulty exhibitions only  causes for disappointed glances and reprimands approaching severity.  Often you would have thought he was a boy of ten reciting his lesson  at her knee.    \"Now Thursday by half past ten, you must have that line right or I  will _scold_ you.\" And she would sometimes laugh a little in her  discouragement.    She looked upon it as a duty, a voluntary drudgery, but which, she  assured him, she was most pleased to do. For she loved Heine--raved  about him, like sentimental German maids. She could never go over  his verse often enough. And so she encouraged Gard to keep on. It  was a reflected part of her normal disciplined life of acquisition.    After a month of these tactics he realized he was making no headway  toward--he did not acknowledge what. Young men as a type did not  seem to Elsa of special interest any more than a hundred other  objects on earth. And then the cold weather before long put an end  to the little promenades of rime by the shore, and Gard had to try  other lines of attack on this radiant and beflowered German  fortress.    The park of fir trees lay quite beyond the meadow. It was a silent,  evocative spot, unfrequented except for a peasant now and then  trudging along under a bundle of wood or a weather-beaten basket of  provisions. Kirtley had managed to stray that far once with Elsa,  but learned that the mother was expected to accompany at such  distances. It provoked his silent comment,    \"As nearly as I can estimate, about a half a mile from home is all  that is allowed a German miss unchaperoned.\"    It was the same when he invited Fraeulein to the opera or theater.  The parent must attend. As she was equally occupied, it did not  appear easy for him to arrange for"]]]
