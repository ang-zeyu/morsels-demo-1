No, I have never heard of it.\"    \"It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,\" said he, \"for I  believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no  other specimen in Europe.  It has not yet found its way either into the  pharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology.  The root is shaped  like a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given  by a botanical missionary.  It is used as an ordeal poison by the  medicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a  secret among them.  This particular specimen I obtained under very  extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.\"  He opened the  paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like  powder.    \"Well, sir?\" asked Holmes sternly.    \"I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for  you already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you  should know all.  I have already explained the relationship in which I  stood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was  friendly with the brothers.  There was a family quarrel about money  which estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up,  and I afterwards met him as I did the others.  He was a sly, subtle,  scheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of  him, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.    \"One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I  showed him some of my African curiosities.  Among other things I  exhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it  stimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and  how either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is  subjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe.  I told him also  how powerless European science would be to detect it.  How he took it I  cannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it  was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he  managed to abstract some of the devil's-foot root.  I well remember how  he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was  needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a  personal reason for asking.    \"I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me  at Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be at sea before  the news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa.  But I returned at once.  Of course, I could not listen to the details  without feeling assured that my poison had been used.  I came round to  see you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself  to you.  But there could be none.  I was convinced that Mortimer  Tregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the  idea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane  he would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the  devil's-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,  and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever  loved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime; what was to be  his punishment?    \"Should I appeal to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that the  facts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe  so fantastic a story?  I might or I might not. But I could not afford  to fail.  My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once  before, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law,  and that I have come at last to be a law to myself.  So it was even  now.  I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be  shared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my  own hand.  In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon  his own life than I do at the present moment.    \"Now I have told you all.  You have yourself supplied the rest. I did,  as you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage.  I  foresaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from  the pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his  window.  He came down and admitted me through the window of the  sitting-room.  I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had  come both as judge and executioner.  The wretch sank into a chair,  paralyzed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder  above it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to  shoot him should he try to leave the room.  In five minutes he died.  My God! how he died!  But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing  which my innocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story,  Mr. Holmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much  yourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take what steps  you like.  As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear  death less than I do.\"    Holmes sat for some little time in silence.    \"What were your plans?\" he asked at last.    \"I had intended to bury myself in central Africa.  My work there is but  half finished.\"    \"Go and do the other half,\" said Holmes.  \"I, at least, am not prepared  to prevent you.\"    Dr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from  the arbour.  Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.    \"Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\" said  he.  \"I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we  are called upon to interfere.  Our investigation has been independent,  and our action shall be so also.  You would not denounce the man?\"    \"Certainly not,\" I answered.    \"I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had  met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done.  Who knows?  Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by  explaining what is obvious.  The gravel upon the window-sill was, of  course, the starting-point of my research.  It was unlike anything in  the vicarage garden.  Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr.  Sterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart.  The lamp shining  in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were  successive links in a fairly obvious chain.  And now, my dear Watson, I  think we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear  conscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be  traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],[0,"Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#6)"],[1,"respecting it.    While his envoys were absent he had his ships careened and repaired.  During this time reports were brought him of the existence of  cinnamon-trees, nutmegs, and rhubarb; and his native friends, when he  showed them gold and pearls, declared that there were people in an  island called Bohio who wore such things round their necks, arms, and  ankles.    The return of the envoys was eagerly looked forward to, but their report  when they appeared quickly disabused the Admiral's mind.  After  travelling about twelve leagues they arrived at a village of about fifty  houses, containing a thousand inhabitants, who had received them with  every mark of respect, looking upon them as beings of a superior order.  The villagers, however, were as little advanced in civilisation as those  on the coast, nor was gold, cinnamon, nor pepper to be found among them,  although they said such things existed far off to the south-west.    On their return with some of the inhabitants, the Spaniards were  surprised to see them roll up the dried leaves of a plant which they  called \"tobacco,\" and smoke it with a satisfaction which the voyagers  could not comprehend, as it appeared to them an unsavoury nauseous  indulgence, little dreaming what determined smokers their descendants  would become.  The envoys described the country as fertile in the  extreme, the fields produced pepper, sweet potatoes, maize, pulse, and  yuca, while the trees were laden with tempting fruits of delicious  flavour.  There was also a vast quantity of cotton,--some just growing,  some in full growth,--while the houses were stored with it partly  wrought into yarn and nets.    Columbus was, by the misapprehension of terms, led into many errors.  Bohio, meaning simply \"a house,\" and therefore signifying a populous  island, was frequently applied to Hispaniola.  His great object,  however, was to reach some civilised country of the East with which he  might establish commercial relations, and carry home its Oriental  merchandise as a rich trophy of his discovery.  Besides Bohio, he had  heard of another island called Babique, of which he now sailed in  search, hoping that it might prove some civilised island on the coast of  Asia.  Shortly afterwards he altered his course east-south-east,  following back the direction of the coast, and thus did not discover his  mistake in supposing Cuba to be a part of _terra firma_, an error in  which he continued to the day of his death.    Some time was spent in cruising about an archipelago of small and  beautiful islands, which has since afforded a lurking-place for  piratical craft.    In attempting to reach the supposed land of Babique, he met with a  contrary gale, which compelled him to put about, when he made signals to  the other vessels to do likewise.    The _Pinta_ did not obey him, and when morning dawned was nowhere to be  seen.  This circumstance disturbed Columbus, who had reason to fear that  Pinzon, jealous of his success, intended to prosecute the discovery by  himself, or to return to Spain with an account of the success of the  enterprise.    Finding that Pinzon did not rejoin him, he returned to Cuba, and  continued for several days sailing along the coast.  Again and again he  was struck with the magnificence of the scenery and size of the trees,  out of a single trunk of which canoes were formed, capable of holding  one hundred and fifty people.  On the 5th of December he reached the  eastern end of Cuba, and then steering large, away from it, he  discovered land to the south-east.  On approaching, he saw high  mountains towering above the horizon, and found that it was an island of  great extent, being Hagi or Hispaniola.    Again his native friends exclaimed, \"Bohio!\"--by which they meant to say  that it was thickly populated, though, as he understood the expression,  that it abounded with gold.  He was struck with the unrivalled beauty of  its scenery.  On the following day he entered a harbour at the western  end, which he called Saint Nicholas.  It was deep and spacious,  surrounded by trees, many of them loaded with fruit.    Sailing again, he entered another harbour, called Port Concepcion, now  known as the Bay of Moustique.  Wishing to open an intercourse with the  natives, he sent six well-armed men into the interior.  The people fled,  but the sailors captured a young female who was perfectly unclothed,--a  bad omen as to the civilisation of the island,--but an ornament of gold  in her nose gave hope that the precious metal might be found there.    The Admiral soothed her terror by presenting her with beads, brass  rings,--hawks' bells, and other trinkets, and sent her on shore clothed,  accompanied by several of the crew and three Indian interpreters.  She  would, however, willingly have remained with the native women she found  on board.  The party were afraid of venturing to the village, and,  having set her at liberty, returned to the ship.    The following morning nine well-armed men, with an interpreter from  Cuba, again landed and approached a village containing a thousand  houses, but the inhabitants had fled.  The interpreter, however,  overtook them, and telling them that the strangers had descended from  the skies, and went about the world making beautiful presents, they  turned back to the number of a thousand, approaching the Spaniards with  slow and trembling steps, making signs of profound reverence.    While they were conversing another large party of Indians approached,  headed by the husband of the female captive, whom they brought in  triumph on their shoulders.  The husband expressed his gratitude for the  magnificent presents bestowed on his wife.    The Indians, now conducting the Spaniards to their houses, set before  them a banquet of cassava bread, fish, roots, and fruits of various  kinds.  They presented also numbers of tame parrots, freely offering,  indeed, whatever they possessed.    Delighted as they were with all they saw, the Spaniards still bitterly  complained that they found no signs of riches among the natives.  Nature  abundantly supplying all they required, they were without even a  knowledge of artificial wants, and so unbounded was their hospitality,  that they were ready to bestow everything they possessed on their  guests.  The fertile earth producing all they required, they preferred  to live in that Arcadian state of simplicity which poets have delighted  to picture.  Their fields and gardens were without hedges or divisions  of any sort.  They were kind to each other, and required no magistrates  nor laws to keep them in order.  Alas! how soon was this happy state of  existence to be destroyed by the cruel, avaricious, and profligate  Spaniards.  Unlike their pious, high-minded, and sagacious chief, they  resembled the bloodhounds they were wont to let loose in chase of their  victims.    How different might have been the fate of the islands had such men as  the pilgrim fathers or the enlightened Penn been the first to settle  among them!  The bright light of true Christianity might have beamed on  their hearts, with all the advantages of civilisation, and far greater  happiness than they had hitherto enjoyed might have been their lot.  No  blame can be attached to Columbus, no slur can be cast on his fair fame.  He had achieved a glorious undertaking in discovering a new world, but  on its inhabitants he had been thus the instrument of bringing the  direst of curses, and, instead of promulgating the faith he professed,  the blackest disgrace on the Christian name.
