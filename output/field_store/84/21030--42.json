Tom afterward killed him with his assegai. I opened the breech of the  gun and hurriedly pulled out the old case, which, to judge from what  ensued, must, I suppose, have burst and left a portion of its fabric  sticking to the barrel. At any rate, when I tried to get in the new case  it would only enter half-way; and--would you believe it?--this was the  moment that the lioness, attracted no doubt by the outcry of her cub,  chose to put in an appearance. There she stood, twenty paces or so from  me, lashing her tail and looking just as wicked as it is possible to  conceive. Slowly I stepped backward, trying to push in the new case, and  as I did so she moved on in little runs, dropping down after each run.  The danger was imminent, and the case would not go in. At the moment  I oddly enough thought of the cartridge-maker, whose name I will not  mention, and earnestly hoped that if the lion got me some condign  punishment would overtake him. It would not go in, so I tried to pull it  out. It would not come out either, and my gun was useless if I could  not shut it to use the other barrel. I might as well have had no gun.  Meanwhile I was walking backward, keeping my eye on the lioness, who was  creeping forward on her belly without a sound, but lashing her tail  and keeping her eye on me; and in it I saw that she was coming in a  few seconds more. I dashed my wrist and the palm of my hand against the  brass rim of the cartridge till the blood poured from them--look, there  are the scars of it to this day!\"    Here Quatermain held up his right hand to the light and showed us four  or five white cicatrices just where the wrist is set into the hand.    \"But it was not of the slightest use,\" he went on; \"the cartridge would  not move. I only hope that no other man will ever be put in such an  awful position. The lioness gathered herself together, and I gave myself  up for lost, when suddenly Tom shouted out from somewhere in my rear:    \"'You are walking on to the wounded cub; turn to the right.'    \"I had the sense, dazed as I was, to take the hint, and slewing round at  right angles, but still keeping my eyes on the lioness, I continued my  backward walk.    \"To my intense relief, with a low growl she straightened herself,  turned, and bounded off farther up the kloof.    \"'Come on, inkoos,' said Tom, 'let's get back to the waggon.'    \"'All right, Tom,' I answered. 'I will when I have killed those three  other lions,' for by this time I was bent on shooting them as I never  remember being bent on anything before or since. 'You can go if you  like, or you can get up a tree.'    \"He considered the position a little, and then he very wisely got up a  tree. I wish that I had done the same.    \"Meanwhile I had found my knife, which had an extractor in it, and  succeeded after some difficulty in hauling out the case which had so  nearly been the cause of my death, and removing the obstruction in the  barrel. It was very little thicker than a postage-stamp; certainly not  thicker than a piece of writing-paper. This done, I loaded the gun,  bound a handkerchief round my wrist and hand to staunch the flowing of  the blood, and started on again.    \"I had noticed that the lioness went into a thick green bush, or rather  cluster of bushes, growing near the water; for there was a little stream  running down the kloof, about fifty yards higher up and for this I made.  When I got there, however, I could see nothing, so I took up a big stone  and threw it into the bushes. I believe that it hit the other cub, for  out it came with a rush, giving me a broadside shot, of which I promptly  availed myself, knocking it over dead. Out, too, came the lioness like a  flash of light, but quick as she went I managed to put the other bullet  into her ribs, so that she rolled right over three times like a shot  rabbit. I instantly got two more cartridges into the gun, and as I did  so the lioness rose again and came crawling toward me on her fore paws,  roaring and groaning, and with such an expression of diabolical fury on  her countenance as I have not often seen. I shot her again through the  chest, and she fell over on to her side quite dead.    \"That was the first and last time that I ever killed a brace of lions  right and left, and, what is more, I never heard of anybody else doing  it. Naturally I was considerably pleased with myself, and having again  loaded up, I went on to look for the black-maned beauty who had killed  Kaptein. Slowly, and with the greatest care, I proceeded up the kloof,  searching every bush and tuft of grass as I went. It was wonderfully  exciting work, for I never was sure from one moment to another but that  he would be on me. I took comfort, however, from the reflection that  a lion rarely attacks a man,--rarely, I say; sometimes he does, as you  will see,--unless he is cornered or wounded. I must have been nearly an  hour hunting after that lion. Once I thought I saw something move in a  clump of tambouki grass, but I could not be sure, and when I trod out  the grass I could not find him.    \"At last I worked up to the head of the kloof, which made a cul-de-sac.  It was formed of a wall of rock about fifty feet high. Down this rock  trickled a little waterfall, and in front of it, some seventy feet from  its face, was a great piled-up mass of boulders, in the crevices and on  the top of which grew ferns, grasses, and stunted bushes. This mass was  about twenty-five feet high. The sides of the kloof here were also very  steep. Well, I came to the top of the nullah and looked all round. No  signs of the lion. Evidently I had either overlooked him farther down or  he had escaped right away. It was very vexatious; but still three lions  were not a bad bag for one gun before dinner, and I was fain to be  content. Accordingly I departed back again, making my way round the  isolated pillar of boulders, beginning to feel, as I did so, that I was  pretty well done up with excitement and fatigue, and should be more so  before I had skinned those three lions. When I had got, as nearly as I  could judge, about eighteen yards past the pillar or mass of boulders,  I turned to have another look round. I have a pretty sharp eye, but I  could see nothing at all.    \"Then, on a sudden, I saw something sufficiently alarming. On the top  of the mass of boulders, opposite to me, standing out clear against the  rock beyond, was the huge black-maned lion. He had been crouching there,  and now arose as though by magic. There he stood lashing his tail,  just like a living reproduction of the animal on the gateway of  Northumberland House that I have seen a picture of. But he did not stand  long. Before I could fire--before I could do more than get the gun to my  shoulder--he sprang straight up and out from the rock, and driven by the  impetus of that one mighty bound came hurtling through the air toward  me.    \"Heavens! how grand he looked, and how awful! High into the air he flew,  describing a great arch. Just as he touched the highest point of his  spring I fired. I did not dare to wait, for I saw that he would clear  the whole space and land right upon me. Without a sight, almost without  aim, I fired, as one would fire a snap-shot at a snipe. The bullet told,  for I distinctly heard its thud above the rushing sound caused by the  passage of the lion through the air. Next second I was swept to the  ground (luckily I fell into a low, creeper-clad bush, which broke the  shock), and the lion was on the top of me, and the next those great  white teeth of his had met in my thigh--I heard them grate against the  bone. I yelled out in agony, for I did not feel in the least benumbed  and happy, like Dr. Livingstone,--whom, by the way, I knew very  well,--and gave myself up for dead. But suddenly, at that moment, the  lion's grip on my thigh loosened, and he stood over me, swaying to and  fro, his huge mouth, from which the blood was gushing, wide opened. Then  he roared, and the sound shook the rocks.    \"To and fro he swung, and then the great head dropped on me, knocking  all the breath from my body, and he was dead. My bullet had entered in  the centre of his chest and passed out on the right side of the spine  about half way down the back.    \"The pain of my wound kept me from fainting, and as soon as I got my  breath I managed to drag myself from under him. Thank heavens, his great  teeth had not crushed my thigh-bone; but I was losing a great deal of  blood, and had it not been for the timely arrival of Tom, with whose aid  I got the handkerchief from my wrist and tied it round my leg, twisting  it tight with a stick, I think that I should have bled to death.    \"Well, it was a just reward for my folly in trying to tackle a family  of lions single-handed. The odds were too long. I have been lame ever  since, and shall be to my dying day; in the month of March the wound  always troubles me a great deal, and every three years it breaks  out raw. I need scarcely add that I never traded the lot of ivory at  Sikukuni's. Another man got it--a German--and made five hundred pounds  out of it after paying expenses. I spent the next month on the broad of  my back, and was a cripple for six months after that. And now I've told  you the yarn, so I will have a drop of Hollands and go to bed.\"          KING BEMBA'S POINT, A WEST AFRICAN STORY, By J.

His rule was mild,  beneficent and just, recognising no distinction between Dane and  Englishman, and throughout his long reign of nearly twenty years the  citizens of London enjoyed that perfect peace so necessary for the  successful exercise of their commercial pursuits.    (M41)    At the election of Cnut's successor which took place at Oxford in 1035,  the Londoners again played an important part. This time, however, it was  not the \"burhwaru or burgesses\" of the City who attended the gemot which  had been summoned for the purpose of election, but \"lithsmen\" of London.    (M42)    As to who these \"lithsmen\" were, and how they came to represent the City  (if indeed they represented the City at all) on this important occasion  much controversy has arisen. To some they appear as nothing more than the  \"nautic multitude\" or \"sea-faring men\" of London.(63) On the other hand,  there are those who hold that they were merchants who had achieved thane  right under the provisions of Athelstan's day already mentioned;(64)  whilst there are still others who are inclined to look upon them as so  many commercial travellers who had made their way to Oxford by river in  the ordinary course of business, and who happened by good fortune to have  been in that city at the time of a great political crisis.(65) The truth  probably lies somewhere between these extremes. The \"lithsmen\" may not  themselves have been thanes, although they are recorded as having been at  Oxford with almost all the thanes north of the Thames;(66) but that they  were something more than mere watermen, such as we shall see joining with  the apprentices of London at important political crises, and that they  were acting more or less as representatives of the Londoners who had  already acquired a predominant voice in such matters, seems beyond doubt.    (M43)    During the next thirty years London took no prominent part in the affairs  of the country, content if only allowed to have leisure to mind its own  business. The desire for peace is the key-note to the action of the  citizens of London at every important crisis. Without peace, commerce  became paralyzed. Peace could be best secured by a strong government, and  such a government, whether in the person of a king or protector could  count upon their support. \"For it they were ready to devote their money  and their lives, for commerce, the child of opportunity, brought wealth;  wealth power; and power led independence in its train.\" The quarrels of  the half-brothers, Harold and Harthacnut, the attempt by one or both of  the sons of Ethelred and Emma to recover their father's kingdom, and the  question of the innocence or guilt of Earl Godwine in connection with the  murder of one of them, affected the citizens of London only so far as such  disturbances were likely to impede the traffic of the Thames or to make it  dangerous for them to convey their merchandise along the highways of the  country.    (M44)    The payment of Danegelt at the accession of Harthacnut (A.D. 1040),(67)  probably touched the feelings, as it certainly did the pockets, of the  Londoners, more than any other event which happened during this period.    (M45)    Upon the sudden death of Harthacnut (A.D. 1042), who died in a fit \"as he  stood at his drink,\"(68) the choice of the whole nation fell on Edward,  his half-brother--\"before the king buried were, all folk chose Edward to  king at London.\"(69) The share that the Londoners took in this particular  election is not so clear as in other cases. Nevertheless, the importance  of the citizens was daily growing, and by the time of the accession of  Edward the Confessor, the City was recognised as the capital of the  kingdom, the chief seat for the administration of the law, and the place  where the king usually resided.(70)    (M46)    In early Saxon times the witan had met in any town where the king happened  at the time to be; and although theoretically every freeman had a right to  attend its meetings, practically the citizens of the town wherein the  gemot happened at the time to be held, enjoyed an advantage over freemen  coming from a distance. Alfred ordained that the witan should meet in  London for purposes of legislation twice a year.(71) Athelstan, Edmund and  Edgar had held gemots in London, the last mentioned king holding a great  gemot (_mycel gemot_) in St. Paul's Church in 973.    (M47)    During the reign of Edward the Confessor, at least six meetings of the  witan took place in London; the more important of these being held in 1051  and the following year. By the gemot of 1051, which partook of the nature  of a court-martial, Earl Godwine was condemned to banishment; but before a  twelve-month had elapsed, he was welcomed back at a great assembly or  _mycel gemot_ held in the open air without the walls of London.(72) The  nation had become disatisfied owing to the king's increasing favour to  Norman strangers, but the earl desired to learn how stood the City of  London towards him, and for this purpose made a stay at Southwark. He was  soon satisfied on this point. \"The townsfolk of the great city were not a  whit behind their brethren of Kent and Sussex in their zeal for the  national cause. The spirit which had beaten back Swend and Cnut, the  spirit which was in after times to make London ever the stronghold of  English freedom, the spirit which made its citizens foremost in the  patriot armies alike of the thirteenth and of the seventeenth centuries,  was now as warm in the hearts of those gallant burghers as in any earlier  or later age. With a voice all but unanimous, the citizens declared in  favour of the deliverer; a few votes only, the votes, it may be, of  strangers or of courtiers, were given against the emphatic resolution,  that what the earl would the city would.\"(73) Having secured the favour of  London his cause was secure. That the citizens heartily welcomed the earl,  going forth in a body to meet him on his arrival, we learn also from  another source;(74) although, one at least of the ancient chroniclers  strongly hints that the favour of the citizens had been obtained by bribes  and promises.(75) The earl's return was marked by decrees of outlawry  against the king's foreign favourites, whose malign influence he had  endeavoured formerly to counteract, and who had proved themselves strong  enough to procure the banishment of himself and family.    (M48)    The last gemot held under Edward was one specially summoned to meet at  Westminster at the close of the year 1065, for the purpose of witnessing  the dedication of the new abbey church which the king loved so well and to  which his remains were so shortly afterwards to be carried.    (M49)    He died at the opening of the year, and the same witan who had attended  his obsequies elected Harold, the late Earl Godwine's son, as his  successor. This election, however, was doomed to be overthrown by the  powerful sword of William the Norman.            CHAPTER II.          (M50)    As soon as the news of Harold's coronation reached William of Normandy, he  claimed the crown which Edward the Confessor had promised him. According  to every principle of succession recognised in England, at the time, he  had no right to the crown whatever. When the Norman invader landed at  Pevensey, Harold was at York, having recently succeeded in defeating his  brother Tostig, the deposed Earl of Northumbria, who, with the assistance  of Harold Hardrada, had attacked the northern earls, Edwine and Morkere.  On hearing of the Duke's landing, Harold hastened to London. A general  muster of forces was there ordered, and Edwine and Morkere, who were bound  to Harold by family tie--the King having married their sister--were bidden  to march southward with the whole force of their earldoms. But neither  gratitude for their late deliverance at the hands of their brother-in-law,  nor family affection, could hurry the steps of these earls, and they  arrived too late. The battle of Senlac, better known as the battle of  Hastings, had been won and lost (14th Oct., 1066), the Norman was  conqueror, and Harold had perished. For a second time within twelve months  the English throne was vacant.(76)    The times were too critical to hold a formal gemot for the election of a  successor to the throne; but the citizens of London and the sailors or  \"butsecarls\" (whom it is difficult not to associate with the \"lithsmen\" of  former days) showed a marked predilection in favour of Edgar the Atheling,  grandson of Edmund Ironside, and the sole survivor of the old royal line.  The Archbishop, too, as well as the northern earls, were in his favour,  but the latter soon withdrew to their respective earldoms and left London  and the Atheling to their fate.(77) Thus, \"the patriotic zeal of the men  of London was thwarted by the base secession of the northern traitors.\"    (M51)    After waiting awhile at Hastings for the country to make voluntary  submission, and finding that homagers did not come in, William proceeded  to make a further display of force. In this he betrayed no haste, but made  his way through Kent in leisurely fashion, receiving on his way the  submission of Winchester and Canterbury, using no more force than was  absolutely necessary, and endeavouring to allay all fears, until at length  he reached the suburbs of London.(78)    He had been astute enough to give out that he came not to claim a crown,  but only a right to be put in nomination for it. To the mind of the  Londoner, such quibbling failed to commend itself, and the citizens lost  no time in putting their city into a posture of defence, determined not to  surrender it without a"]]]
