The landlord, therefore, had no sooner given them the spirit-rousing  intelligence than everyone, as by instinct, swore his own natural oath,  and grasped his own natural weapon. A few of those of the highest rank  were armed with swords, which they boldly drew; those of the  subordinate orders immediately flew to such weapons as the room,  kitchen, and scullery afforded--such as tongs, pokers, spits, racks,  and shovels; and breathing vengeance on the prelatic party, the  children of Antichrist and the heirs of d--n--t--n! the barterers of  the liberties of their country, and betrayers of the most sacred  trust--thus elevated, and thus armed, in the cause of right, justice,  and liberty, our heroes rushed to the street, and attacked the mob with  such violence that they broke the mass in a moment, and dispersed their  thousands like chaff before the wind. The other party of young  Jacobites, who sat in a room farther from the front, and were those  against whom the fury of the mob was meant to have been directed, knew  nothing of this second uproar, till the noise of the sally made by the  Whigs assailed their ears; being then informed that the mob had  attacked the house on account of the treatment they themselves had  given to a young gentleman of the adverse faction, and that another  jovial party had issued from the house in their defence, and was now  engaged in an unequal combat, the sparks likewise flew, to the field to  back their defenders with all their prowess, without troubling their  heads about who they were.    A mob is like a spring tide in an eastern storm, that retires only to  return with more overwhelming fury. The crowd was taken by surprise  when such a strong and well-armed party issued from the house with so  great fury, laying all prostrate that came in their way. Those who were  next to the door, and were, of course, the first whom the imminent  danger assailed, rushed backwards among the crowd with their whole  force. The Black Bull standing in a small square half-way between the  High Street and the Cowgate, and the entrance to it being by two  closes, into these the pressure outwards was simultaneous, and  thousands were moved to an involuntary flight, they knew not why.    But the High Street of Edinburgh, which they soon reached, is a  dangerous place in which to make an open attack upon a mob. And it  appears that the entrances to the tavern had been somewhere near to the  Cross, on the south side of the street; for the crowd fled with great  expedition, both to the cast and west, and the conquerors, separating  themselves as chance directed, pursued impetuously, wounding and  maiming as they flew. But it so chanced that, before either of the  wings had followed the flying squadrons of their enemies for the space  of a hundred yards each way, the devil an enemy they had to pursue! the  multitude had vanished like so many thousands of phantoms! What could  our heroes do? Why, they faced about to return towards their citadel,  the Black Bull. But that feat was not so easily, nor so readily  accomplished as they divined. The unnumbered alleys on each side of the  street had swallowed up the multitude in a few seconds; but from these  they were busy reconnoitring; and  perceiving the deficiency in the  number of their assailants, the rush from both sides of the street was  as rapid, and as wonderful, as the disappearance of the crowd had been  a few minutes before. Each close vomited out its levies, and these  better armed with missiles than when they sought it for a temporary  retreat. Woe then to our two columns of victorious Whigs! The mob  actually closed around them as they would have swallowed them up; and,  in the meanwhile, shower after shower of the most abominable weapons of  offence were rained in upon them. If the gentlemen were irritated  before, this inflamed them still further; but their danger was now so  apparent they could not shut their eyes on it; therefore, both parties,  as if actuated by the same spirit, made a desperate effort to join, and  the greater part effected it; but some were knocked down, and others  were separated from their friends, and blithe to become silent members  of the mob.    The battle now raged immediately in front of the closes leading to the  Black Bull; the small body of Whig gentlemen was hardly bested, and it  is likely would have been overcome and trampled down every man, had  they not been then and there joined by the young Cavaliers; who, fresh  to arms, broke from the wynd, opened the head of the passage, laid  about them manfully, and thus kept up the spirits of the exasperated  Whigs, who were the men in fact that wrought the most deray among the  populace.    The town-guard was now on the alert; and two companies of the  Cameronian Regiment, with the Hon. Captain Douglas, rushed down from  the Castle to the scene of action; but, for all the noise and hubbub  that these caused in the street, the combat had become so close and  inveterate that numbers of both sides were taken prisoners fighting  hand to hand, and could scarcely be separated when the guardsmen and  soldiers had them by the necks.    Great was the alarm and confusion that night in Edinburgh; for everyone  concluded that it was a party scuffle, and, the two parties being so  equal in power, the most serious consequences were anticipated. The  agitation was so prevailing that every party in town, great and small,  was broken up; and the lord-commissioner thought proper to go to the  Council Chamber himself, even at that late hour, accompanied by the  sheriffs of Edinburgh and Linlithgow, with sundry noblemen besides, in  order to learn something of the origin of the affray.    For a long time the court was completely puzzled. Every gentleman  brought in exclaimed against the treatment he had received, in most  bitter terms, blaming a mob set on him and his friends by the adverse  party, and matters looked extremely ill until at length they began to  perceive that they were examining gentlemen of both parties, and that  they had been doing so from the beginning, almost alternately, so  equally had the prisoners been taken from both parties. Finally, it  turned out that a few gentlemen, two-thirds of whom were strenuous  Whigs themselves, had joined in mauling the whole Whig population of  Edinburgh. The investigation disclosed nothing the effect of which was  not ludicrous; and the Duke of Queensberry, whose aim was at that time  to conciliate the two factions, tried all that he could to turn the  whole fracas into a joke--an unlucky frolic, where no ill was meant on  either side, and which yet had been productive of a great deal.    The greater part of the people went home satisfied; but not so the Rev.  Robert Wringhim. He did all that he could to inflame both judges and  populace against the young Cavaliers, especially against the young  Laird of Dalcastle, whom he represented as an incendiary, set on by an  unnatural parent to slander his mother, and make away with a hapless  and only brother; and, in truth, that declaimer against all human merit  had that sort of powerful, homely, and bitter eloquence which seldom  missed affecting his hearers: the consequence at that time was that he  made the unfortunate affair between the two brothers appear in  extremely bad colours, and the populace retired to their homes  impressed with no very favourable opinion of either the Laird of  Dalcastle or his son George, neither of whom were there present to  speak for themselves.    As for Wringhim himself, he went home to his lodgings, filled with gall  and with spite against the young laird, whom he was made to believe the  aggressor, and that intentionally. But most of all he was filled with  indignation against the father, whom he held in abhorrence at all  times, and blamed solely for this unmannerly attack made on his  favourite ward, namesake, and adopted son; and for the public  imputation of a crime to his own reverence in calling the lad his son,  and thus charging him with a sin against which he was well known to  have levelled all the arrows of church censure with unsparing might.    But, filled as his heart was with some portion of these bad feelings,  to which all flesh is subject, he kept, nevertheless, the fear of the  Lord always before his eyes so far as never to omit any of the external  duties of religion, and farther than that man hath no power to pry. He  lodged with the family of a Mr. Miller, whose lady was originally from  Glasgow, and had been a hearer and, of course, a great admirer of Mr.  Wringhim. In that family he made public worship every evening; and that  night, in his petitions at a throne of grace, he prayed for so many  vials of wrath to be poured on the head of some particular sinner that  the hearers trembled, and stopped their ears. But that he might not  proceed with so violent a measure, amounting to excommunication,  without due scripture warrant, he began the exercise of the evening by  singing the following verses, which it is a pity should ever have been  admitted into a Christian psalmody, being so adverse to all its mild  and benevolent principles:        Set thou the wicked over him,    And upon his right hand    Give thou his greatest enemy,    Even Satan, leave to stand.      And, when by thee he shall be judged,    Let him remembered be;    And let his prayer be turned to sin    When he shall call on thee.      Few be his days; and in his room    His charge another take;    His children let be fatherless;    His wife a widow make:      Let God his father's wickedness    Still to remembrance call;    And never let his mother's sin    Be blotted out at all.      As he in cursing pleasure took    So let it to him fall;    As he delighted not to bless,    So bless him not at all.

[Illustration: _Fig. 20._ VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY]    _Plus and Minus Signs._--It will be noted that the positive or copper  disc has the plus sign (+) while the zinc disc has the minus (-) sign.  These signs denote the positive and the negative sides of the current.    The liquid in the cells, or in the moistened paper, is called the  _electrolyte_ and the plates or discs are called _electrodes_. To define  them more clearly, the positive plate is the _anode_, and the negative  plate the _cathode_.    The current, upon entering the zinc plate, decomposes the water in the  electrolyte, thereby forming oxygen. The hydrogen in the water, which  has also been formed by the decomposition, is carried to the copper  plate, so that the plate finally is so coated with hydrogen that it is  difficult for the current to pass through. This condition is called  \"polarization,\" and to prevent it has been the aim of all inventors. To  it also we may attribute the great variety of primary batteries, each  having some distinctive claim of merit.    THE COMMON PRIMARY CELL.--The most common form of primary cell contains  sulphuric acid, or a sulphuric acid solution, as the electrolyte, with  zinc for the _anode_, and carbon, instead of copper, for the _cathode_.    The ends of the zinc and copper plates are called _terminals_, and while  the zinc is the anode or positive element, its _terminal_ is designated  as the positive pole. In like manner, the carbon is the negative  element or cathode, and its terminal is designated as negative pole.    Fig. 21 will show the relative arrangement of the parts. It is customary  to term that end or element from which the current flows as positive. A  cell is regarded as a whole, and as the current passes out of the cell  from the copper element, the copper terminal becomes positive.    [Illustration: _Fig. 21._ PRIMARY BATTERY]    BATTERY RESISTANCE, ELECTROLYTE AND CURRENT.--The following should be  carefully memorized:    A cell has reference to a single vessel. When two or more cells are  coupled together they form a _battery_.    _Resistance_ is opposition to the movement of the current. If it is  offered by the electrolyte, it is designated \"Internal Resistance.\" If,  on the other hand, the opposition takes place, for instance, through the  wire, it is then called \"External Resistance.\"    The electrolyte must be either acid, or alkaline, or saline, and the  electrodes must be of dissimilar metals, so the electrolyte will attack  one of them.    The current is measured in amperes, and the force with which it is  caused to flow is measured in volts. In practice the word \"current\" is  used to designate ampere flow; and electromotive force, or E. M. F., is  used instead of voltage.    ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ELECTRICITY.--The third method of generating  electricity is by electro-magnets. The value and use of induction will  now be seen, and you will be enabled to utilize the lesson concerning  magnetic action referred to in the previous chapter.    MAGNETIC RADIATION.--You will remember that every piece of metal which  is within the path of an electric current has a space all about its  surface from end to end which is electrified. This electrified field  extends out a certain distance from the metal, and is supposed to  maintain a movement around it. If, now, another piece of metal is  brought within range of this electric or magnetic zone and moved across  it, so as to cut through this field, a current will be generated  thereby, or rather added to the current already exerted, so that if we  start with a feeble current, it can be increased by rapidly \"cutting the  lines of force,\" as it is called.    DIFFERENT KINDS OF DYNAMO.--While there are many kinds of dynamo, they  all, without exception, are constructed in accordance with this  principle. There are also many varieties of current. For instance, a  dynamo may be made to produce a high voltage and a low amperage; another  with high amperage and low voltage; another which gives a direct current  for lighting, heating, power, and electroplating; still another which  generates an alternating current for high tension power, or  transmission, arc-lighting, etc., all of which will be explained  hereafter.    In this place, however, a full description of a direct-current dynamo  will explain the principle involved in all dynamos--that to generate a  current of electricity makes it necessary for us to move a field of  force, like an armature, rapidly and continuously through another field  of force, like a magnetic field.    DIRECT-CURRENT DYNAMO.--We shall now make the simplest form of dynamo,  using for this purpose a pair of permanent magnets.    [Illustration: _Fig. 22._ DYNAMO FIELD AND POLE PIECE]    SIMPLE MAGNET CONSTRUCTION.--A simple way to make a pair of magnets for  this purpose is shown in Fig. 22. A piece of round 3/4-inch steel core  (A), 5-1/2 inches long, is threaded at both ends to receive at one end a  nut (B), which is screwed on a sufficient distance so that the end of  the core (A) projects a half inch beyond the nut. The other end of the  steel core has a pole piece of iron (C) 2\" x 2\" x 4\", with a hole  midway between the ends, threaded entirely through, and provided along  one side with a concave channel, within which the armature is to turn.  Now, before the pole piece (C) is put on, we will slip on a disc (E),  made of hard rubber, then a thin rubber tube (F), and finally a rubber  disc (G), so as to provide a positive insulation for the wire coil which  is wound on the bobbin thus made.    HOW TO WIND.--In practice, and as you go further along in this work, you  will learn the value, first, of winding one layer of insulated wire on  the spool, coating it with shellac, and then putting on the next layer,  and so on; when completely wound, the two wire terminals may be brought  out at one end; but for our present purpose, and to render the  explanation clearer, the wire terminals are at the opposite ends of the  spool (H, H').    THE DYNAMO FIELDS.--Two of these spools are so made and they are called  the _fields_ of the dynamo.    We will next prepare an iron bar (I), 5 inches long and 1/2 inch thick  and 1-1/2 inches wide, then bore two holes through it so the distance  measures 3 inches from center to center. These holes are to be threaded  for the 3/4-inch cores (A). This bar holds together the upper ends of  the cores, as shown in Fig. 23.    [Illustration: _Fig. 23._ BASE AND FIELDS ASSEMBLED]    We then prepare a base (J) of any hard wood, 2 inches thick, 8 inches  long and 8 inches wide, and bore two 3/4-inch holes 3 inches apart on a  middle line, to receive a pair of 3/4-inch cap screws (K), which pass  upwardly through the holes in the base and screw into the pole pieces  (C). A wooden bar (L), 1-1/2\" x 1-1/2\", 8 inches long, is placed under  each pole piece, which is also provided with holes for the cap screws  (K). The lower side of the base (J) should be countersunk, as at M, so  the head of the nut will not project. The fields of the dynamo are now  secured in position to the base.    [Illustration: _Fig. 24._ DETAILS OF THE ARMATURE, CORE    _Fig. 25._ DETAILS OF THE ARMATURE, BODY]    THE ARMATURE.--A bar of iron (Fig. 24), 1\" x 1\" and 2-1/4 inches long,  is next provided. Through this bar (1) are then bored two 5/16-inch  holes 1-3/4 inches apart, and on the opposite sides of this bar are two  half-rounded plates of iron (3) (Fig. 25).    ARMATURE WINDING.--Each plate is 1/2 inch thick, 1-3/4 inches wide and 4  inches long, each plate having holes (4) to coincide with the holes (2)  of the bar (1), so that when the two plates are applied to opposite  sides of the bar, and riveted together, a cylindrical member is formed,  with two channels running longitudinally, and transversely at the ends;  and in these channels the insulated wires are wound from end to end  around the central block (1).    MOUNTING THE ARMATURE.--It is now necessary to provide a means for  revolving this armature. To this end a brass disc (5, Fig. 26) is made,  2 inches in diameter, 1/8 inch thick. Centrally, at one side, is a  projecting stem (6) of round brass, which projects out 2 inches, and the  outer end is turned down, as at 7, to form a small bearing surface.    [Illustration: _Fig. 26._ JOURNALS _Fig. 27._ COMMUTATOR,  ARMATURE MOUNTINGS]    The other end of the armature has a similar disc (8), with a central  stem (9), 1-1/2 inches long, turned down to 1/4-inch diameter up to  within 1/4 inch of the disc (7), so as to form a shoulder.    THE COMMUTATOR.--In Fig. 27 is shown, at 10, a wooden cylinder, 1 inch  long and 1-1/4 inches in diameter, with a hole (11) bored through  axially, so that it will fit tightly on the stem (6) of the disc (5). On  this wooden cylinder is driven a brass or copper tube (12), which has  holes (13) opposite each other. Screws are used to hold the tube to the  wooden cylinder, and after they are properly secured together, the tube  (12) is cut by a saw, as at 14, so as to form two independent tubular  surfaces.    [Illustration: _Fig. 28._ END VIEW ARMATURE, MOUNTED]    These tubular sections are called the commutator plates.    [Illustration: _Fig. 29._ TOP VIEW OF ARMATURE ON BASE]    In order to mount this armature, two bearings are provided, each  comprising a bar of brass (15, Fig. 28), each 1/4 inch thick, 1/2 inch  wide and 4-1/2 inches long. Two holes, 3 inches apart, are formed  through this bar, to receive round-headed wood screws (16), these screws  being 3 inches long, so they will pass through the wooden pieces (I)  and enter the base (J). Midway between the ends, each bar (15) has an  iron bearing block (17), 3/4\" x 1/2\" and 1-1/2 inches high, the 1/4-inch  hole for the journal (7) being midway between its ends.
