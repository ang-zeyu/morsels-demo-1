Like a well-guarded frontier fort, with defences within and  without, so let a man guard himself. Not a moment should escape, for  they who allow the right moment to pass, suffer pain when they are in  hell.    316. They who are ashamed of what they ought not to be ashamed of, and  are not ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of, such men, embracing  false doctrines enter the evil path.    317. They who fear when they ought not to fear, and fear not when they  ought to fear, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path.    318. They who forbid when there is nothing to be forbidden, and forbid  not when there is something to be forbidden, such men, embracing false  doctrines, enter the evil path.    319. They who know what is forbidden as forbidden, and what is not  forbidden as not forbidden, such men, embracing the true doctrine, enter  the good path.          Chapter XXIII. The Elephant    320. Silently shall I endure abuse as the elephant in battle endures the  arrow sent from the bow: for the world is ill-natured.    321. They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king mounts a tamed  elephant; the tamed is the best among men, he who silently endures  abuse.    322. Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses, and elephants  with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better still.    323. For with these animals does no man reach the untrodden country  (Nirvana), where a tamed man goes on a tamed animal, viz. on his own  well-tamed self.    324. The elephant called Dhanapalaka, his temples running with sap, and  difficult to hold, does not eat a morsel when bound; the elephant longs  for the elephant grove.    325. If a man becomes fat and a great eater, if he is sleepy and rolls  himself about, that fool, like a hog fed on wash, is born again and  again.    326. This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as it liked, as  it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in thoroughly, as the  rider who holds the hook holds in the furious elephant.    327. Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw yourself out of the  evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.    328. If a man find a prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and  lives soberly, he may walk with him, overcoming all dangers, happy, but  considerate.    329. If a man find no prudent companion who walks with him, is wise,  and lives soberly, let him walk alone, like a king who has left his  conquered country behind,--like an elephant in the forest.    330. It is better to live alone, there is no companionship with a fool;  let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with few wishes, like an  elephant in the forest.    331. If an occasion arises, friends are pleasant; enjoyment is pleasant,  whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant in the hour of death; the  giving up of all grief is pleasant.    332. Pleasant in the world is the state of a mother, pleasant the state  of a father, pleasant the state of a Samana, pleasant the state of a  Brahmana.    333. Pleasant is virtue lasting to old age, pleasant is a faith firmly  rooted; pleasant is attainment of intelligence, pleasant is avoiding of  sins.          Chapter XXIV. Thirst    334. The thirst of a thoughtless man grows like a creeper; he runs from  life to life, like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.    335. Whomsoever this fierce thirst overcomes, full of poison, in this  world, his sufferings increase like the abounding Birana grass.    336. He who overcomes this fierce thirst, difficult to be conquered in  this world, sufferings fall off from him, like water-drops from a lotus  leaf.    337. This salutary word I tell you, `Do ye, as many as are here  assembled, dig up the root of thirst, as he who wants the sweet-scented  Usira root must dig up the Birana grass, that Mara (the tempter) may not  crush you again and again, as the stream crushes the reeds.'    338. As a tree, even though it has been cut down, is firm so long as its  root is safe, and grows again, thus, unless the feeders of thirst are  destroyed, the pain (of life) will return again and again.    339. He whose thirst running towards pleasure is exceeding strong in the  thirty-six channels, the waves will carry away that misguided man, viz.  his desires which are set on passion.    340. The channels run everywhere, the creeper (of passion) stands  sprouting; if you see the creeper springing up, cut its root by means of  knowledge.    341. A creature's pleasures are extravagant and luxurious; sunk in lust  and looking for pleasure, men undergo (again and again) birth and decay.    342. Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare; held in  fetters and bonds, they undergo pain for a long time, again and again.    343. Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare;  let therefore the mendicant drive out thirst, by striving after  passionlessness for himself.    344. He who having got rid of the forest (of lust) (i.e. after having  reached Nirvana) gives himself over to forest-life (i.e. to lust), and  who, when removed from the forest (i.e. from lust), runs to the forest  (i.e. to lust), look at that man! though free, he runs into bondage.    345. Wise people do not call that a strong fetter which is made of iron,  wood, or hemp; far stronger is the care for precious stones and rings,  for sons and a wife.    346. That fetter wise people call strong which drags down, yields, but  is difficult to undo; after having cut this at last, people leave the  world, free from cares, and leaving desires and pleasures behind.    347. Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the stream (of  desires), as a spider runs down the web which he has made himself;  when they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the world free from  cares, leaving all affection behind.    348. Give up what is before, give up what is behind, give up what is in  the middle, when thou goest to the other shore of existence; if thy mind  is altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into birth and decay.    349. If a man is tossed about by doubts, full of strong passions, and  yearning only for what is delightful, his thirst will grow more and  more, and he will indeed make his fetters strong.    350. If a man delights in quieting doubts, and, always reflecting,  dwells on what is not delightful (the impurity of the body, &c.), he  certainly will remove, nay, he will cut the fetter of Mara.    351. He who has reached the consummation, who does not tremble, who is  without thirst and without sin, he has broken all the thorns of life:  this will be his last body.    352. He who is without thirst and without affection, who understands the  words and their interpretation, who knows the order of letters (those  which are before and which are after), he has received his last body, he  is called the great sage, the great man.    353. `I have conquered all, I know all, in all conditions of life I am  free from taint; I have left all, and through the destruction of thirst  I am free; having learnt myself, whom shall I teach?'    354. The gift of the law exceeds all gifts; the sweetness of the law  exceeds all sweetness; the delight in the law exceeds all delights; the  extinction of thirst overcomes all pain.    355. Pleasures destroy the foolish, if they look not for the other  shore; the foolish by his thirst for pleasures destroys himself, as if  he were his own enemy.    356. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by passion:  therefore a gift bestowed on the passionless brings great reward.    357. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by hatred:  therefore a gift bestowed on those who do not hate brings great reward.    358. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by vanity:  therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from vanity brings great  reward.    359. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by lust:  therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from lust brings great  reward.          Chapter XXV. The Bhikshu (Mendicant)    360. Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear, in the  nose restraint is good, good is restraint in the tongue.    361. In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in  thought restraint is good, good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu,  restrained in all things, is freed from all pain.    362. He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet, he who controls  his speech, he who is well controlled, he who delights inwardly, who is  collected, who is solitary and content, him they call Bhikshu.    363. The Bhikshu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely and calmly,  who teaches the meaning and the law, his word is sweet.    364. He who dwells in the law, delights in the law, meditates on the  law, follows the law, that Bhikshu will never fall away from the true  law.    365. Let him not despise what he has received, nor ever envy others: a  mendicant who envies others does not obtain peace of mind.    366. A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not despise what he  has received, even the gods will praise him, if his life is pure, and if  he is not slothful.    367. He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does not  grieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.    368. The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in the doctrine  of Buddha, will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural  desires, and happiness.    369. O Bhikshu, empty this boat! if emptied, it will go quickly; having  cut off passion and hatred thou wilt go to Nirvana.    370. Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five. A  Bhikshu, who has escaped from the five fetters, he is called Oghatinna,  `saved from the flood.'    371. Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless!

At these Times (at meals) the Master      observed these wholesom and godly Orders, for the continual      instruction of their Youth in Virtue and Learning; that is, one of      the Novices appointed by the Master, read some Part of the Old and      New Testament in Latin, during Dinner, having a convenient place at      the _South_ End of the High Table, within a beautiful Glass Window,      encompass'd with Iron, and certain Stone Steps, with Iron Rails to      go up to an Iron Desk, whereon lay the Holy Bible....        \"This Fabrick retained the Name of the Petty Canons' Hall till _Dr      Sudbury_, Dean of the Cathedral, generously erected a beautiful      Library in its Place; but he not living to finish it compleatly, did      by (a clause) in his Last Will, bind his Heir, _Sir John Sudbury_,      to the due Execution thereof.\"    [Illustration: S. Cuthbert's Chest.]    The contents of the library are both numerous and interesting. There are  several thousands of volumes, many of them being rare and valuable.  Numerous ancient illuminated MSS., among which is a copy of the Gospels  of S. Mark, S. Luke, and S. John, written before the year 700; and  several books given by Bishops Carileph and Pudsey. Among the latter is  a Bible, in four volumes, in its original stamped leather binding. A  collection of ancient copes belonging to the cathedral, and the remains  of the robes of S. Cuthbert, and other relics taken from his coffin when  it was exhumed, in 1827, may also be seen here. Numerous specimens of  Roman altars, tablets, and sculptured stones, from various Roman  stations in Durham and Northumberland, notably from Hexham, are  preserved in this library, which is open to the public on Tuesday and  Friday in each week from eleven to one. The room is finely proportioned,  and has a magnificent open timber roof.    [Illustration: The Chapter-House.]    The #Chapter-House# opens upon the eastern alley of the cloister. The  present building is a very recent restoration of the original, which is  acknowledged to have been the finest existing Norman chapter-house  remaining in England. It was erected, or more probably completed, during  the time of Bishop Galfrid Rufus (1133-1140), and was in existence until  1796, during the episcopate of Bishop Barrington. At that time it was  almost totally destroyed, on the advice of Wyatt, who reported to the  chapter that it was in a ruinous state. The truth of this report is  doubtful, but the partial demolition of the building was ordered in  November 1795, and also the construction of a new room on the site. The  work of destruction was begun by knocking out the keystones of the  vaulting and allowing the roof to fall in. The eastern half of the  building was then altogether removed, and the remaining portion enclosed  by a wall. Its interior was faced with lath and plaster, a plaster  ceiling and a boarded floor being added. Fortunately authentic records  of its original appearance, both exterior and interior, are in  existence. They are the drawings made for the Society of Antiquaries by  John Carter in 1795. Its dimensions were 78 by 35 feet; the east end  being apsidal and the roof a vault of one span. Round the wall of the  interior ran a stone bench raised on two steps, which was surmounted,  except at the west end, by a wall arcade, of round-headed intersecting  arches, similar to that in the aisles of the cathedral, but with single  instead of double shafts. Above the arcade was a string course carved  with zig-zag ornament. The entrance was from the west end, and the east  end was occupied by two seats, one for the bishop and one for the prior.  In the apse were five three-light windows of the Decorated period, and  above the western door a five-light Perpendicular window, which  contained coloured glass, illustrating the \"Root of Jesse.\" On either  side of this was a window of two lights, divided by a shaft and enclosed  under one arch, carved with chevron ornament. There was also a  round-headed Norman window in each of the north and south walls. A  doorway in the south wall led to three chambers, one larger, and two  smaller, which are stated in the \"Rites of Durham\" to have been used as  a prison for the monks. The chapter-house was used in early times as a  burial-place for the bishops, and many of their graves with inscriptions  were in existence previous to the demolition of 1796. During excavations  in 1874, the graves of Bishops Flambard, Galfrid Rufus, S. Barbara, de  Insula, and Kellaw were opened, when various rings and the head of a  crozier were discovered and removed to the dean and chapter library.    The chapter-house has now been entirely restored as a memorial to the  late Bishop Lightfoot.    The #Northern Alley# of the Cloister, running along the south wall of  the church, contains little of interest, except the two doorways  previously described.    The effect of the cloister as a whole, in its original condition, with  the windows glazed, many containing fine stained glass, the oak roof  with its heraldry and colour, and the lavatory in the centre of the  garth, must have been exceptionally fine.    [Illustration: The Exterior, from the South-east.]    A sculptured panel on the north-west turret of the Nine Altar Chapel is  now known as the #Dun Cow#. The original sculpture was replaced in  the last century by the existing panel, but the legend connected with it  is interesting. After their flight from Chester-le-Street, the monks,  bearing the body of S. Cuthbert, remained some time at Ripon. While  trying to return to Chester-le-Street, at a place called Wardlaw, the  coffin stuck fast, and remained absolutely fixed. A fast of three days  was proclaimed and kept, when it was revealed to them that they were to  carry their saint to Dunholme. Still they were in difficulties, not  knowing where Dunholme was, but fortune, or Providence, again favoured  them. A woman, who had lost a cow, passed, calling to a companion to  inquire if she had seen the animal. The reply was that her cow was in  Dunholme; and, to the relief of the monks, they and their precious  charge soon safely arrived there. In grateful commemoration of the  incident Flambard erected this monument of a milkmaid and her cow. (See  p. 9.)    The exterior of Durham Cathedral as a whole may at first sight be  disappointing to the visitor. Seen from a near view there is a certain  flatness of effect and want of light and shade which is, perhaps,  slightly unpleasant. This is, however, largely attributable to the  scaling and scraping process to which the building was subjected during  the last century, when some inches of the outer surface of the stone,  and with it much architectural detail, were removed. The result is the  flatness previously alluded to, and a general newness of appearance  pervades the structure. Seen, however, from a distance, where only the  finely-grouped and proportioned masses of masonry, towers, and turrets  stand against the sky, the result is magnificent, giving an impression  of grandeur and dignity unsurpassed by any other English cathedral.          [Illustration: The Nave, looking West.]    CHAPTER III    DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERIOR      If the exterior of Durham is in any way disappointing, the interior more  than compensates for its shortcomings. The general impression on  entering the church is one of simple dignity and solemnity. The great  massiveness of the structure and absence of elaborate ornament no doubt  contribute to this feeling. The pious builders of old have certainly  contrived to stamp on their work their own feeling of awe in the  presence of the All-Powerful and Eternal God. Whatever has been lost  through vandalism and the restorer, this remains unaltered. The general  design of the church, exclusive of detail, which, of course, changed and  developed with the progress of Gothic art, has undoubtedly been carried  out on the plan intended by Bishop Carileph, the only important  variation being the addition of the transept at the east end, known as  the Nine Altars Chapel. The original plan consists of a nave and aisles,  transepts with aisles on their eastern side, a choir also with aisles,  and the three apses of the east end, with a central tower over the  junction of transepts, nave, and choir, and towers flanking the west  end.    [Illustration: One Bay Of The Nave (Measured Drawing).]    Each bay of the #Nave# is divided into two sub-bays. The main bays  have massive piers with engaged shafts on the recessed faces. The bases  of these are cruciform in plan, though the arms of the cross are very  short. At the height of the springing of the arch the shafts are  surmounted by plain cushion capitals. The division into sub-bays is  effected by the introduction midway of a massive round column on a  square base. These columns are ornamented in various ways, by channels  cut on the face. Some take the form of a zig-zag, some a spiral, others  a spiral in two directions, forming a trellis-like pattern, and others  again are reeded vertically. Their capitals are octagonal cushions. The  arches of the sub-bays are recessed square, with the usual Norman roll  moulding, decorated with chevrons, and on the wall face a square billet.  The chevron ornament is absent in the earlier work in the choir and  transepts. The triforium is almost uniform throughout the whole church.  In each sub-bay it consists of two small arches under one larger one,  with the tympanum solid. Here also the capitals are cushions and  perfectly plain.    [Illustration: Triforium and Clerestory.]    Above the triforium is the clerestory, which contains one light to each  sub-bay, and surmounting all is the vaulting, which springs from the  piers and from grotesquely carved corbels between the triforium arches.  The vaulting ribs are ornamented with chevrons on either side of a bold  semi-circular moulding. So much for the general arrangement of"]]]
