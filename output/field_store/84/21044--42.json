Now you know that Rubens is always  spoken of as a great colorist, _par excellence_ a colorist; and would  you not have expected that--before all things--the first thing he  would have seen in a peacock would have been gold and blue? He sees  nothing of the kind. A peacock, to him, is essentially a dark bird;  serpent-like in the writhing of the neck, cloud-like in the toss and  wave of its plumes. He has dashed out the filaments of every feather  with magnificent drawing; he has not given you one bright gleam of  green or purple in all the two birds.    Well, the reason of that is that Rubens is not _par excellence_ a  colorist; nay, is not even a good colorist. He is a very second-rate  and coarse colorist; and therefore his color catches the lower public,  and gets talked about. But he is _par excellence_ a splendid  draughtsman of the Greek school; and no one else, except Tintoret,  could have drawn with the same ease either the muscles of the dead  body or the plumes of the birds.    48. Farther, that he never became a great colorist does not mean that  he could not, had he chosen. He was warped from color by his lower  Greek instincts, by his animal delight in coarse and violent forms and  scenes--in fighting, in hunting, and in torments of martyrdom and of  hell: but he had the higher gift in him, if the flesh had not subdued  it. There is one part of this picture which he learned how to do at  Venice, the Iris, with the golden hair, in the chariot behind Juno. In  her he has put out his full power, under the teaching of Veronese and  Titian; and he has all the splendid Northern-Gothic, Reynolds or  Gainsborough play of feature with Venetian color. Scarcely anything  more beautiful than that head, or more masterly than the composition  of it, with the inlaid pattern of Juno's robe below, exists in the art  of any country. _Si sic omnia!_--but I know nothing else equal to it  throughout the entire works of Rubens.    49. See, then, how the picture divides itself. In the fleshly  baseness, brutality and stupidity of its main conception, is the Dutch  part of it; that is Rubens' own. In the noble drawing of the dead body  and of the birds you have the Phidias-Greek part of it, brought down  to Rubens through Michael Angelo. In the embroidery of Juno's robe you  have the Daedalus-Greek part of it, brought down to Rubens through  Veronese. In the head of Iris you have the pure Northern-Gothic part  of it, brought down to Rubens through Giorgione and Titian.    50. Now, though--even if we had given ten minutes of digression--the  lessons in this picture would have been well worth it, I have not, in  taking you to it, gone out of my own way. There is a special point for  us to observe in those dark peacocks. If you look at the notes on the  Venetian pictures in the end of my \"Stones of Venice,\" you will find  it especially dwelt upon as singular that Tintoret, in his picture of  \"The Nativity,\" has a peacock without any color in it. And the reason  of it is also that Tintoret belongs, with the full half of his mind,  as Rubens does, to the Greek school. But the two men reach the same  point by opposite paths. Tintoret begins with what Venice taught him,  and adopted what Athens could teach: but Rubens begins with Athens,  and adopts from Venice. Now if you will look back to my fifth  Lecture[9] you will find it said that the colorists can always adopt  as much chiaroscuro as suits them, and so become perfect; but the  chiaroscurists cannot, on their part, adopt color, except partially.  And accordingly, whenever Tintoret chooses, he can laugh Rubens to  scorn in management of light and shade; but Rubens only here and  there--as far as I know myself, only this once--touches Tintoret or  Giorgione in color.    [Footnote 9: \"Lectures on Art\" (the Inaugural Course, 1870), Sec. 138.]    51. But now observe farther. The Greek chiaroscuro, I have just told  you, is by one body of men pursued academically, as a means of  expressing form; by another, tragically, as a mystery of light and  shade, corresponding to--and forming part of--the joy and sorrow of  life. You may, of course, find the two purposes mingled: but pure  formal chiaroscuro--Marc Antonio's and Leonardo's--is inconsistent  with color, and though it is thoroughly necessary as an exercise, it  is only as a correcting and guarding one, never as a basis of art.    52. Let me be sure, now, that you thoroughly understand the relation  of formal shade to color. Here is an egg; here, a green cluster of  leaves; here, a bunch of black grapes. In formal chiaroscuro, all  these are to be considered as white, and drawn as if they were carved  in marble. In the engraving of \"Melancholy,\" what I meant by telling  you it was in formal chiaroscuro was that the ball is white, the  leaves are white, the dress is white; you can't tell what color any of  these stand for. On the contrary, to a colorist the first question  about everything is its color. Is this a white thing, a green thing,  or a blue thing? down must go my touch of white, green, or dark blue  first of all; if afterwards I can make them look round, or like fruit  and leaves, it's all very well; but if I can't, blue or green they at  least shall be.    53. Now here you have exactly the thing done by the two masters we are  speaking of. Here is a copy of Turner's vignette of \"Martigny.\" This  is wholly a design of the colored school. Here is a bit of vine in the  foreground with purple grapes; the grapes, so far from being drawn as  round, are struck in with angular flat spots; but they are vividly  purple spots, their whole vitality and use in the design is in their  Tyrian nature. Here, on the contrary, is Duerer's \"Flight into Egypt,\"  with grapes and palm fruit above. Both are white; but both engraved so  as to look thoroughly round.    54. All the other great chiaroscurists whom I named to you--Reynolds,  Velasquez, and Titian--approached their shadow also on the safe  side--from Venice: they always think of color first. But Turner had to  work his way out of the dark Greek school up to Venice; he always  thinks of his shadow first; and it held him in some degree fatally to  the end. Those pictures which you all laughed at were not what you  fancied, mad endeavors for color; they were agonizing Greek efforts to  get light. He could have got color easily enough if he had rested in  that; which I will show you in next Lecture. Still, he so nearly made  himself a Venetian that, as opposed to the Dutch academical  chiaroscurists, he is to be considered a Venetian altogether. And now  I will show you, in a very simple subject, the exact opposition of the  two schools.    55. Here is a study of swans, from a Dutch book of academical  instruction in Rubens' time. It is a good and valuable book in many  ways, and you are going to have some copies set you from it. But as a  type of academical chiaroscuro it will give you most valuable lessons  on the other side--of warning.    Here, then, is the academical Dutchman's notion of a swan. He has  laboriously engraved every feather, and has rounded the bird into a  ball; and has thought to himself that never swan has been so engraved  before. But he has never with his Dutch eyes perceived two points in a  swan which are vital to it: first, that it is white; and, secondly,  that it is graceful. He has above all things missed the proportion,  and necessarily therefore the bend of its neck.    56. Now take the colorist's view of the matter. To him the first main  facts about the swan are that it is a white thing with black spots.  Turner takes one brush in his right hand, with a little white in it;  another in his left hand, with a little lampblack. He takes a piece of  brown paper, works for about two minutes with his white brush, passes  the black to his right hand, and works half a minute with that, and,  there you are!    You would like to be able to draw two swans in two minutes and a half  yourselves. Perhaps so, and I can show you how; but it will need  twenty years' work all day long. First, in the meantime, you must draw  them rightly, if it takes two hours instead of two minutes; and, above  all, remember that they are black and white.    57. But farther: you see how intensely Turner felt precisely what the  Fleming did not feel--the bend of the neck. Now this is not because  Turner is a colorist, as opposed to the Fleming; but because he is a  pure and highly trained Greek, as opposed to the Fleming's low Greek.  Both, so far as they are aiming at form, are now working in the Greek  school of Phidias; but Turner is true Greek, for he is thinking only  of the truth about the swan; and De Wit is pseudo-Greek, for he is  thinking not of the swan at all, but of his own Dutch self. And so he  has ended in making, with his essentially piggish nature, this  sleeping swan's neck as nearly as possible like a leg of pork.    That is the result of academical work, in the hands of a vulgar  person.    58. And now I will ask you to look carefully at three more pictures in  the London Exhibition.    The first, \"The Nativity,\" by Sandro Botticelli.[10] It is an early  work by him; but a quite perfect example of what the masters of the  pure Greek school did in Florence.    [Footnote 10: Now in the National Gallery, No. 1034.]    One of the Greek main characters, you know, is to be [Greek:  aprosopos], faceless. If you look first at the faces in this picture  you will find them ugly--often without expression, always ill or  carelessly drawn. The entire purpose of the picture is a mystic  symbolism by motion and chiaroscuro. By motion, first. There is a dome  of burning clouds in the upper heaven. Twelve angels half float, half  dance, in a circle, round the lower vault of it. All their drapery is  drifted so as to make you feel the whirlwind of their motion.

We went to Cumberland Lodge, the King  living at the Royal Lodge. Aunt Gloucester was there at the same  time. When we arrived at the Royal Lodge the King took me by the hand,  saying: 'Give me your little paw.' He was large and gouty but with a  wonderful dignity and charm of manner. He wore the wig which was so  much worn in those days. Then he said he would give me something for  me to wear, and that was his picture set in diamonds, which was worn  by the Princesses as an order to a blue ribbon on the left shoulder. I  was very proud of this,--and Lady Conyngham pinned it on my shoulder.  Her husband, the late Marquis of Conyngham, was the Lord  Chamberlain and constantly there, as well as Lord Mt. Charles (as  Vice-Chamberlain), the _present_ Lord Conyngham.    \"None of the Royal Family or general visitors lived at the Royal  Lodge, but only the Conyngham family; all the rest at Cumberland  Lodge. Lady Maria Conyngham (now dead, first wife to Lord Athlumney,  daughter of Lord Conyngham), then quite young, and Lord Graves  (brother-in-law to Lord Anglesey and who afterwards shot himself on  account of his wife's conduct, who was a Lady of the Bedchamber), were  desired to take me a drive to amuse me. I went with them, and Baroness  (then Miss) Lehzen (my governess) in a pony carriage and 4, with 4  grey ponies (like my own), and was driven about the Park and taken to  Sandpit Gate where the King had a Menagerie--with wapitis, gazelles,  chamois, etc., etc. Then we went (I think the next day) to Virginia  Water, and met the King in his phaeton in which he was driving the  Duchess of Gloucester,--and he said 'Pop her in,' and I was lifted  in and placed between him and Aunt Gloucester, who held me round  the waist. (Mamma was much frightened.) I was greatly pleased, and  remember that I looked with great respect at the scarlet liveries,  etc. (the Royal Family had crimson and green liveries and only the  King scarlet and blue in those days). We drove round the nicest part  of Virginia Water and stopped at the Fishing Temple. Here there was  a large barge and every one went on board and fished, while a band  played in another! There were numbers of great people there, amongst  whom was the last Duke of Dorset, then Master of the Horse. The King  paid great attention to my Sister,[2] and some people fancied he  might marry her!! She was very lovely then--about 18--and had charming  manners, about which the King was extremely particular. I afterwards  went with Baroness Lehzen and Lady Maria C. to the Page Whiting's  cottage. Whiting had been at one time in my father's service. He lived  where Mr Walsh now does (and where he died years ago), in the small  cottage close by; and here I had some _fruit_ and amused myself by  cramming one of Whiting's children, a little girl, with peaches. I  came after dinner to hear the band play in the Conservatory, which  is still standing, and which was lit up by coloured lamps--the King,  Royal Family, etc., sitting in a corner of the large saloon, which  still stands.        [Footnote 2: The Princess Feodore of Leiningen, afterwards      Princess of Hohenlohe, Queen Victoria's half-sister.]    \"On the second visit (I _think_) the following year, also in summer,  there was a great encampment of tents (the same which were used at  the Camp at Chobham in '53, and some single ones at the Breakfasts at  Buckingham Palace in '68-9), and which were quite like a house, made  into different compartments. It rained dreadfully on this occasion,  I well remember. The King and party dined there, Prince and Princess  Lieven, the Russian Ambassador and Ambassadress were there.    \"I also remember going to see Aunt Augusta at Frogmore, where she  lived always in the summer.    \"We lived in a very simple, plain manner; breakfast was at half-past  eight, luncheon at half-past one, dinner at seven--to which I came  generally (when it was no regular large dinner party)--eating my bread  and milk out of a small silver basin. Tea was only allowed as a great  treat in later years.      [Pageheading: DUCHESS OF SAXE-COBURG-SAALFELD]    \"In 1826 (I think) my dear Grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of  Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, came to Claremont, in the summer. Mamma and my  sister went on part of the way to meet her, and Uncle Leopold I think  had been to fetch her as far as Dover. I recollect the excitement and  anxiety I was in, at this event,--going down the great flight of steps  to meet her when she got out of the carriage, and hearing her say,  when she sat down in her room, and fixed her fine clear blue eyes on  her little grand-daughter whom she called in her letters 'the flower  of May,' 'Ein schoenes Kind'--'a fine child.' She was very clever and  adored by her children but especially by her sons. She was a good deal  bent and walked with a stick, and frequently with her hands on her  back. She took long drives in an open carriage and I was frequently  sent out with her, which I am sorry to confess I did not like, as,  like most children of that age, I preferred running about. She was  excessively kind to children, but could not bear naughty ones--and I  shall never forget her coming into the room when I had been crying and  naughty at my lessons--from the next room but one, where she had  been with Mamma--and scolding me severely, which had a very salutary  effect. She dined early in the afternoon and Uncle Leopold asked many  of the neighbours and others to dinner to meet her. My brother Prince  Leiningen came over with her, and was at that time paying his court  to one of her ladies, Countess Klebelsberg, whom he afterwards  married--against the wish of his grandmother and mother--but which was  afterwards quite made up. In November (I think, or it may have been  at the end of October) she left, taking my sister with her back to  Coburg. I was very ill at that time, of dysentery, which illness  increased to an alarming degree; many children died of it in the  village of Esher. The Doctor lost his head, having lost his own child  from it, and almost every doctor in London was away. Mr Blagden came  down and showed much energy on the occasion. I recovered, and remember  well being very cross and screaming dreadfully at having to wear, for  a time, flannel next my skin. Up to my 5th year I had been very much  indulged by every one, and set pretty well _all_ at defiance. Old  Baroness de Spaeth, the devoted Lady of my Mother, my Nurse Mrs Brock,  dear old Mrs Louis--_all_ worshipped the poor little fatherless child  whose future then was still very uncertain; my Uncle the Duke of  Clarence's poor little child being alive, and the Duchess of Clarence  had one or two others later. At 5 years old, Miss Lehzen was placed  about me, and though she was most kind, she was very firm and I had  a proper respect for her. I was naturally very passionate, but always  most contrite afterwards. I was taught from the first to beg my maid's  pardon for any naughtiness or rudeness towards her; a feeling I have  ever retained, and think every one should _own_ their fault in a kind  way to any one, be he or she the lowest--if one has been rude to or  injured them by word or deed, especially those below you. People will  readily forget an insult or an injury when others _own_ their fault,  and express sorrow or regret at what they have done.\"      [Pageheading: THE EDUCATION OF THE PRINCESS]    In 1830 the Duchess of Kent wished to be satisfied that the system of  education then being pursued with the Princess was based on the right  lines, and that due moral and intellectual progress was being made.  A memorandum, carefully preserved among the archives, gives an  interesting account of the steps which she took to this end.      [Pageheading: LETTER TO THE BISHOPS]    [Pageheading: RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION]    The Duchess therefore brought the matter under the consideration  of those whom, from their eminent piety, great learning, and high  station, she considered best calculated to afford her valuable advice  upon so important a subject. She stated to the Bishops of London  and Lincoln[3] the particular course which had been followed in the  Princess's education, and requested their Lordships to test the  result by personal examination. The nature and objects of Her Royal  Highness's appeal to these eminent prelates will be best shown by the  following extracts from her letter to the Bishops:--      \"'The Princess will be eleven years of age in May; by the    death of her revered father when she was but eight months old,    her sole care and charge devolved to me. Stranger as I then    was, I became deeply impressed with the absolute necessity of    bringing her up entirely in this country, that every feeling    should be that of Her native land, and proving thereby my    devotion to duty by rejecting all those feelings of home and    kindred that divided my heart.      \"'When the Princess approached her fifth year I considered it    the proper time to begin in a moderate way her education--an    education that was to fit Her to be either the Sovereign of    these realms, or to fill a junior station in the Royal Family,    until the Will of Providence should shew at a later period    what Her destiny was to be.      \"'A revision of the papers I send you herewith will best shew    your Lordships the system pursued, the progress made, etc. I    attend almost always myself every lesson, or a part; and as    the Lady about the Princess is a competent person, she assists    Her in preparing Her lessons for the various masters, as    I resolved to act in that manner so as to be Her Governess    myself.
