My, but you  are a royal personage! One thing will be very satisfactory about this  audience. No matter whether it likes my talk or not it can't run  away.\"    There was a peal of laughter from Theo.    In the meantime Mr. Croyden poked the fire into a blaze and sitting  down in a comfortable chair began his story.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER IV    MR. CROYDEN'S STORY      \"Hundreds and hundreds of years ago,\" said Mr. Croyden, \"while the  Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans were experimenting at  pottery-making, the Chinese, inside their great walled country, were  busy with the same task. In fact as far back as two thousand years  before Christ the Chinese were famous potters, making earthenware of  such fine quality that it was difficult to tell whether it was pottery  or porcelain. For the two are quite different, you must remember,  Theo. It is not enough to say that pottery is thick and porcelain  thin, for much of the Chinese and Japanese pottery is very thin  indeed. The difference lies in the clay itself, of which the ware is  made. Do not forget that. Pottery is an opaque ware composed of  various combinations of clay which afterward may or may not have a  coating of glaze put over it. But genuine porcelain is made from a  mixture of quite different materials--a mixture of decomposed feldspar  known as kaolin, and petuntse.\"    Mr. Croyden paused a moment.    \"There are of course so-called porcelains made from other ingredients;  but we call them soft paste chinas, and do not rate them as true  porcelains. Only a hard paste, or kaolin ware, is acknowledged by  experts to be genuine porcelain. Now all this sounds very simple. By  putting the kaolin and the petuntse together in the right proportions,  moulding the clay, and afterward applying to it a glaze of some sort  the Chinese made their porcelain, and very beautiful porcelain it  was. Some day I will tell you more about it. This porcelain was not  only very hard but was semi-translucent; by that I mean that if it was  held to the light one could see the glow through it. It was not, of  course, transparent like glass. These two qualities of hardness and  translucence help us to distinguish porcelain from pottery.\"    Again Mr. Croyden stopped.    \"For example, Canton ware, commonly known as Canton china, is not  really china at all, but is instead a fine quality of stone, or  earthenware, coated over with a slip or glaze containing porcelain.  Nor is the exquisite Satsuma ware china; that too is a pottery.\"    Theo listened intently.    \"Now all this time the Chinese kept the secret of how they made their  wares to themselves, not sharing their knowledge with any outside  peoples. Many a nation would have given almost anything to know from  what materials the beautiful bowls, vases, and dishes were made. It  would have saved years and years of the toil of patient men. But the  Chinese had no mind to tell any one. Instead, they went on making more  and more pottery and porcelain, improving their work with each  successive generation. It is amusing to recall that while our  ancestors in England were barbarians, and were eating out of the  crudest clay vessels or from trenchers of wood, the Chinese were  enjoying the luxury of the finest pottery and porcelain.\"    Theo's eyes opened very wide.    \"Undoubtedly the Chinese deserved the good results they obtained, for  they selected their clays with extreme care; ground and mixed them  most skilfully; modeled each piece with the keenest feeling for its  beauty and perfection; and decorated it in a truly artistic spirit.    \"In the meantime they constantly became more and more expert. They  began to learn the use of colors, and to perfect them. Some of the  blues or cobalts they employed have never been surpassed. One for  instance is the blue used on their Nankin china, and known as Nankin  blue.\"    \"Did the Japanese make pottery too?\" questioned Theo.    \"Yes, but we do not know exactly how early they began to make  it. Probably some of the Japanese crossed to China and there learned  the art. Some think pottery-making came into Japan through  Korea. However that may be, long before other countries had to any  extent perfected the manufacture of glazed pottery and porcelain  China, Japan, Persia, and India had turned their attention to it. As  far back as 1000 B. C. the Japanese were making porcelains  similar to those of China. Then followed a long stretch of years when,  because of various wars between China and Japan, the art of producing  glazed pottery and porcelain was lost. All those workmen who possessed  any knowledge of their manufacture perished. This was the period when  the Greeks and Romans were making their red and black ware which, you  recall, they did not know how to glaze, and therefore had no means of  preventing liquids from leaking through it.\"    \"I wish they had had the secrets of the Chinese and Japanese!\" Theo  said.    \"I wish so too,\" echoed Mr. Croyden. \"As it was, they struggled along  with their beautiful pottery vases through which the water percolated  just as it does through a flower-pot. And so it was for a time in  China and Japan. It was not until centuries afterward that the Chinese  and Japanese again rediscovered the art they had lost, and by that  time the Greeks and Romans were no more, newer races having taken  their places. Some of the wonderful old enamel work of the Chinese,  however, was never reclaimed, and rare pieces of porcelain of a kind  no one has yet been able to reproduce remain to tell us of the skill  of those ancient Chinese workmen.\"    \"If the Chinese kept everything so secret how did the art of glazed  pottery-making ever get into Europe?\" asked Theo.    Mr. Croyden smiled.    \"It was a marvel that it ever did,\" he answered slowly. \"Of course as  people traveled little in those days one country did not know much  about what another was doing. But there were wars when much booty was  carried from one land to another; the pilgrimages of the Crusaders,  too, helped to spread a knowledge of widely separated sections.  Gradually bits of Chinese pottery and porcelain found their way into  different parts of the East; and as a consequence men began to be  highly dissatisfied with their red and black ware, and with the crude  clay dishes they had previously thought so fine. They wanted to make  white ware like that of the Chinese. But because they did not know  what clays to use, or how to glaze their products, all their  experiments failed. There did nevertheless appear throughout the  Orient a ware of common clay over which a simple covering of white had  been painted, and this slip or engobe of white gave to the variety the  name of Oriental Engobe. This type of ware decorated with a  conventional dull-hued design was many years later revived and  imitated by Theodore Deck of Paris, one of the great French porcelain  makers. But even this was not like the white Chinese ware everybody  wanted so much to make.\"    \"Did they never find out the secret?\"    \"Of that I will tell you some other time. It is a most interesting  story,\" returned Mr. Croyden. \"In the meantime the Moors and Arabs  who had lived in the Orient had in some way learned that tin or lead  could be used for enameling clay surfaces. The discovery  apparently did not particularly interest them because, you see, in the  East minerals were not plentiful. When, however, in the twelfth  century they conquered Spain they found in that country quantities of  lead and tin, and they then recalled that these could be used as a  glaze for pottery. In consequence they promptly set to work making an  enameled ware called Majolica or Maiolica from the Island of Maiorca.  These Moors were a highly cultured race who built in Spain beautiful  temples and palaces, among them the Alhambra, of which perhaps you  have read.\"    Theo's eyes shone.    \"We read about it at school!\" he cried.    \"I am glad to hear that,\" exclaimed Mr. Croyden. \"Then you will  remember what a wonderful structure it was. In its interior have been  found many highly glazed tiles beautifully designed and decorated in  colors and in gold. Within this palace, too, was found the famous  Alhambra Vase, three feet four inches in height, and made in 1320. It  is a piece of work quite different from anything the Greeks made, but  in its way is quite as perfect. It is of earthenware, with a white  ground, and is enameled in two shades of blue with a further  decoration of gold or copper lustre. I speak particularly of this use  of glaze because it is very important. Until people knew how to glaze  their wares many of the comforts and conveniences of living were  impossible. Men carried water or wine in leather gourds, or in clay  vessels coated on the inside with a layer of gum to prevent the  contents from leaking or evaporating.\"    \"I should think the gum would have made the liquid taste,\" said Theo.    \"It did. That was precisely the trouble. Beside that think of the  waste. Suppose you lost half the water you needed for your journey by  having it evaporate. Think in addition what it meant if a large part  of your food dried up in the cooking.\"    Theo looked grave.    \"I should not like that at all.\"    \"Nor did your ancestors,\" laughed Mr. Croyden. \"Well, it was to  these Mohammedan Arabs, or Saracens, as they are termed, that Europe  fundamentally owed its knowledge of the use of glaze, and its  consequent beginning in the art of pottery-making. The Saracens did  not, however, remain in Spain. There was an uprising of the Christians  and they were either driven out or slaughtered, almost every relic of  their civilization being destroyed. A stray temple or palace alone  remains as a monument to them and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19424"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Exeter (#6)"],[1,"rst, the  cathedral was Saxon and remained so for nearly seventy years; then came  a Norman bishop who pulled down the existing building and replaced it by  the foundations and towers of a finer one. For ninety-nine years,  sometimes languishingly, sometimes vigorously, the work continued: so  that by the end of Marshall's episcopate (1206) Warelwast's noble  ambition was realized. Between this date and 1280 the church was  scarcely touched, but a chapter house was built by Bishop Bruere \"to God  and the Church of St. Mary and St. Peter, a sufficient area to make a  Chapter House in our garden near the Tower of St. John.\" A third style,  Early English, was then introduced, to be followed by the almost  complete transformation of the entire building into the Decorated style.  Following on this we get some examples of Perpendicular work. Now, this  series of changes is noticeable in itself, and remarkable because it has  not affected the building in a way that might have been expected. The  first impression, indeed, that a view of the exterior gives one, is that  it is the result of one design, which is largely the case. It is only on  closer inspection that the remnants of the pre-decorated periods are  visible. \"The Church,\" as Professor Freeman neatly puts it, \"grew up  after one general pattern, but with a certain advance in detail as the  work went westward.\"    The second thing that strikes the visitor is that he has never seen a  church quite like it. \"It forms a class by itself, and can be compared  with nothing save its own miniature at Ottery.\"    Putting aside the Saxon cathedral of Leofric it is possible to trace  four distinct styles in what has been wisely called \"the noblest  monument of religious zeal of our forefathers in the west of England.\"  But in discovering these the feeling of wonder increases as the building  is found to be not a mere jumble but a complete whole. Though it is  possible to date the separate parts of the edifice, and recognize the  varying forms of workmanship, the architects laboured with so clear an  understanding of a beautiful result to be attained, that there is no  appearance of patchwork.    The best views of the building are those to be got from a distance. In  some ways this is not without compensation; for the cathedral church  was, and is, not only splendid as a building, but the centre of the  spiritual life of the diocese. It is, therefore, appropriate that it  should seem most beautiful to the dwellers in the villages and hamlets  beyond the city, giving them, as it were, a kind of property in the  building, which they might not have felt had it been less visible.  Nearing Exeter by train, from the Plymouth side, the noble roof and  towers are seen above the red houses of the city. The site, indeed, was  well chosen. Below the hill on which the city stands are gardens gay  with flowers and fair apple orchards. Above, there is a blue sky richer  and deeper than is usual in England. On all sides but one stretches the  beautiful Devonshire country, meadow, hedgerow, and wooded hill. On that  side the Exe flows rapidly, broadening as it goes, towards the sea.  Southward but a few miles, the blue channel waters creep up against the  yellow sand dunes. No cathedral, not even Lincoln, boasts a more lovely  and appropriate position. \"In the minds of all early Christians,\" says  Mr. Ruskin, \"the church itself was most frequently symbolized under the  image of a ship,\" There is no country so saturated with traditions of  the sea as Cornwall and Devon. \"Exe terra\"--out of the earth--is  sometimes declared to be the derivation of the name Exeter. Maybe this  was only the grateful jest of some seaman who found himself, after the  winter storms, gliding up the quiet river with the city walls rising up  before him. Yet the remembrance of such western heroes as Raleigh and  Drake, who bade their followers sit well in order, and strike--        \"The sounding furrows, for my purpose holds      To sail beyond the sunset and the baths      Of all the Western stars until I die,\"[2]    makes one realize how fit it is that the towers of the cathedral should  look across the country to the \"deep waters,\" and be to the mariner as  the masts of a vessel whereon was safety, however fierce the storm.        [2] Tennyson's \"Ulysses.\"    [Illustration: EXETER CATHEDRAL, FROM AN ENGRAVING BY DANIEL KING,                 c. 1650.]    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL--FROM THE SOUTH-EAST.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    From many parts of the surrounding country fine views may be obtained,  from Waddlesdown, Alphington Causeway, and many a canal and river bank.    A closer view may seem at first disappointing. Every writer has echoed  Dr. Oliver's regret that it should be surrounded \"by dwelling-houses of  such disparate character.\" But even a nearer survey is, with patience,  rewarded. The towers, exquisitely traceried windows, sculptured  doorways, and magnificent roof, easily persuade us to forget its mean  surroundings.    #The Towers.#--To many these will be the most interesting portion of the  building. The exterior of no other cathedral boasts so unusual a  feature. Their position is extraordinary and has given rise to endless  controversies. It has been suggested that they were meant to stand as  western towers, and that the building was to stand east of them, and  that, as an afterthought, they were converted into transepts. But Canon  Freeman, in his history,[3] dismisses this view as merely attractive.  They would certainly be more elaborate, he thinks, if they had been  built as western towers, but they have neither portal nor ornamental  work. Indeed, up to more than half their height they have very much the  appearance of fortresses. It may well be that they served as such in  Stephen's time, for the northern one was severely battered. It differs  somewhat in detail from that on the south side, there being an  interlacing arcade half-way up, possibly being so rebuilt when the  devastation caused by the siege was being repaired. There are six stages  on each tower, but only the uppermost four are in any way ornamented.  These have blind arcades and window openings of circular form; but the  details differ slightly on each. The turrets at the angles of the  summits, and the battlements were added in the fifteenth century, but  the effect is not inharmonious, and the original details are well  preserved. According to an old seventeenth-century print, the north  tower formerly had an attic with a pyramidal roof. This was probably an  addition when the great bell was first hung (see p. 74). The effect of  these transeptal towers is so fine as to make us regret their rarity. A  case in which they were obviously imitated is to be seen in the fine  parish church of Ottery S. Mary, Devon. There are also most practical  reasons in their favour, and a consideration of them tends to increase  one's wonder that they should not be found more frequently. In the first  place it is possible to get a continuous, uniform, stretch of vault, the  roof being broken by no central tower. Also the plan is simplified, and  nave and choir have more architectural continuity. Again, by building  transeptal towers and discarding the usual central tower, the interior  escapes a danger it is often hard to overcome, the difficulty of holding  up the central tower. It is quite possible that Warelwast was far-seeing  enough to anticipate this trouble. The histories of other cathedrals  prove it to be a very real one. In 1107 the tower of Winchester fell in.  At Salisbury the spire is still a constant source of anxiety, despite \"a  complex arrangement of iron bands and ties,\" which has been reinforced  more than once. The tower of Chichester collapsed in 1861. There is a  legend of the fall of a central tower at Christchurch Priory, and other  warnings could be cited, such as Hereford, Selby, Peterborough, and  Wells.        [3] \"Architectural History of Exeter Cathedral,\" by Philip          Freeman, Archdeacon and Canon of Exeter (Bell), 1888.    Originally these two towers were cut off, by two arches underneath, from  the body of the church. But Quivil, wishing to enlarge the interior, did  so by \"throwing the Tower spaces into it.\"    #The Roof# is one of the most striking features of the building,  especially as it is seen from a distance. The long line of the ridge of  nave and choir, unbroken by a central tower, give it a unique  distinction amongst English cathedrals. The delicate cresting of  fleurs-de-lis, and the pinnacles which crown the supporting buttresses  obviate any impression of heaviness, and together with the long series  of clerestory windows, alike in form yet differing in their admirable  tracery, give a singular impression of beauty.    #The North Porch.#--This was the northern entrance of the Norman church,  and from the outside it is possible to trace the line where the  fifteenth-century front was added to the old structure. It is decorated  with seven canopied niches in the style of that period. These, however,  remained vacant until 1920, when they were filled with statues, by Mr.  H. Read of Exeter, representing the patron saints of England and the  Allies: St. George, St. Denys, St. Joseph; SS. Cyril and Methodius; St.  Vladimir, and St. Ambrose. The roof is vaulted, and on the central boss  is a finely-carved Agnus Dei. Within a recess of the eastern wall are  three headless figures, representing, in the centre, the Crucifixion,  St. Mary and St. John standing on either side. Over the inside doorway  is a niche that probably once held a figure of the Virgin.    [Illustration: THE NORTHERN TOWER.                 The Photochrom Co.
