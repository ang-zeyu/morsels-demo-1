Here families and friends gather, chat in the intervals, and listen to  the music, quietly sipping their beer or chocolate, and supper is  served in the intermission to those who order it. Smoking is  forbidden, but seldom is the hour after supper free from fumes of  smokers who quietly venture to light their cigars unrebuked unless the  room gets _too_ blue. Many entire families seem to make nightly  rendezvous at these concerts, enjoying the music as only Germans do,  and setting many a pretty picture in the minds of strangers. The  concerts are over by nine or ten o'clock, but the performances at  theatre and opera are frequently not concluded before half-past ten or  eleven, and an after-supper at a _cafe_ or at home is a consequent  necessity. In one aspect of behavior at concerts, American audiences  may well imitate our German friends. The beginning of every piece of  music is the signal for instantaneous cessation from conversation. I  do not remember ever having been annoyed during the performance of  music, either in public or private, while in Germany, by the talking  of any except Americans or other foreigners. To the music-loving  Germans this is among the greatest of social sins.            III.    EDUCATION.      The buildings of the Berlin University are somewhat scattered, but the  edifice known by this name is situated opposite the Imperial Palace,  in the finest part of the city. The building was once the palace of  Prince Henry, brother of Frederick the Great. It is built around three  sides of a court open southward to the street, guarded by a high  ornamental iron fence. Before it are the sitting statues of the  brothers Humboldt, in fine white marble, on high pedestals. That of  Alexander von Humboldt, in particular, inspired me with profound  admiration often as I passed it. Few statues are more fortunate in  subject, in execution, or in position. The former reception-room of  the palace is now the great _aula_ of the University, and the old  ball-room is transformed into a Museum. The Cabinet of Minerals and  the Collections of the Zooelogical Museum are each among the most  valuable of their kind in existence. The fine park to the north of the  University is open to the public, and is best seen from the rear  entrance in Dorotheen Strasse. Its quiet shades seem quite the ideal  of an academic grove, if that can be in the middle of a great city.  The Astronomical Observatory is upwards of half a mile south, in a  park at the end of Charlotten Strasse; and the Medical Colleges are  mostly to the northwest, near the great hospital.    This University, with its hundreds of professors, and nearly six  thousand students annually in attendance, is now one of the foremost  in Europe. Professors who, like Virchow, Helmholtz, and Mommsen, have  a world-wide reputation, draw many to their classes; but there are  other equally learned specialists with a more circumscribed reputation  and influence. Hundreds of American students tarry each year for a  longer or shorter term of study in Berlin, and it is rapidly gaining  upon Leipsic as a centre for musical study also. No woman is allowed  to matriculate in the University at present, although there are not  wanting German women who, in advance of general public sentiment,  affirm that this ought not so to be.    The Academy of Arts and the Academy of Science are housed in the  conspicuous building opposite the palace of Emperor William I. and  adjoining the University. The Science Academy is organized in four  sections, physical, mathematical, philosophical, and historical, and  has valuable endowments and scholarships. The Academy of Arts has one  section devoted to higher instruction in painting, engraving, and  sculpture, and one to music, eminent specialists in each branch  composing the Board of Direction. The imposing building of the  Institute of Technology, near the extremity of the Thiergarten, has a  fine Technological Museum, and accommodation for two thousand  students. Its organization grew out of the union of two previously  existing institutions for the promotion of architecture and trade. It  has now five sections, in which about one thousand students pursue the  study of architecture, civil engineering, machinery, ship-building,  mining, and chemistry.    Instruction in the science of war is given in all its departments, as  might be expected. The War Office of the Government is in the  Leipziger Strasse, adjoining the Reichstag, with one of the finest of  ancient parks behind it, covering a space equal to several squares in  the heart of the city. This park is elaborate and finely kept, but it  is surrounded by high walls, within which the public is rarely  admitted. Even its existence is unsuspected by most visitors. The  large and elegant building of the War Academy in the Dorotheen Strasse  has a war library of eight hundred thousand volumes and magnificent  accessories. Its object is to educate army officers. There are three  courses of study, promotion from which to the General Staff is made by  examinations. The business of the General Staff is, in war, to  regulate the movements of the army and to attend to the correct  registration of material for war history. In peace, the time of the  officers who compose it is devoted to a profound post-graduate study  of the science and the art of warfare.    An important accessory to the privileges of the University is the  Royal Library, opposite the main building and adjacent to the palace  of Emperor William I. in the Opera Platz. It is possible, though not  common, for ladies to be allowed the privileges of this library,  consisting of over a million volumes and thousands of valuable and  curious manuscripts. A card of introduction to the Director from an  influential source gave me the great pleasure of the use both of the  library and the fine reading-rooms. Considerable time was consumed in  the preliminaries, and there was red tape to be untied, but in general  no unnecessary obstacles were thrown in the way even of a woman. On my  first visit, before the requisite permission to use the library had  been obtained, I was treated as a visitor, and most politely shown the  treasures of the institution by intelligent officials. A young man who  spoke excellent English was given me as a guide by the distinguished  Director-in-Chief. Classification of the books is carried to great  minuteness, and it is but the work of a moment, to one familiar with  its principles, to turn to any book of the million. The apartments are  plain and crowded, although some of the rooms of the adjoining palace  had recently been turned into the library, which is fast outgrowing  its accommodations. The young librarian who acted as our guide was  eager for information concerning American libraries, asking  particularly about the size and classification of the Boston Public  Library. It was a pleasure to respond to one so intelligent and  interested, and I felt sure he would make good use of every scrap of  trustworthy information. He showed us his books with pride, and gave  many interesting particulars. He also displayed to us some of the  treasures kept in glass cases and usually covered from the light. Here  were Luther's manuscript translation of the Bible, Gutenberg's Bible,  the first book printed on movable types, the ancient Codex of the time  of Charlemagne, miniatures, illuminated missals, and other things of  much interest. As my dinner-hour approached I begged off for that day  from the cordially offered inspection of the celebrated Hamilton  manuscripts. It is said that the highest-priced book ever sold was the  vellum missal presented to King Henry VIII. by Pope Leo X., which  brought $50,000. The missal was accompanied by a document conferring  on the King the title of \"Defender of the Faith.\" It is now in this  collection, having been given by King Charles II. to an ancestor of  the Duke of Hamilton, whose manuscripts were purchased by the German  Government in 1882.    The tables of the reading-rooms for periodicals are well filled with  magazines in all languages, and equal politeness is shown by  officials. The apartments are in the second story, reached by a  stairway ascending from a paved court off the Behren Strasse, in the  rear of the Imperial Palace. No lovely spring-time memories are to us  more vivid and attractive than those of the library reading-room, in  the second story of the Library building, looking on the Opera Platz.  Here, among many students of all nationalities from the University, I  was wont to spend long delicious afternoons at a table of my own  choosing, to which attentive officials brought the books of my  selection, and where I was free to turn to books of reference on the  shelves beside me. The room would accommodate perhaps two hundred,  similarly employed. Among those I frequently met there were a German  lady and an American gentleman whom I was so happy as to number among  my friends. Intercourse between our tables was by smiles and nods,  seldom crystallizing into words, but these were not wanted. Four  centuries looked down upon us in portraits from the walls, and forty  centuries were ours in the books below them. As the season advanced,  the room was not full, and the long French windows stood open. Before  them was a balcony facing the Platz, with its fountains, its  shrubbery, and its flowers. The breath of spring and early summer was  perfumed by mignonette and English violets, as it floated away from  the murmur and the brightness of the brilliant scenes beyond up  through every alcove of this quiet scholar's retreat.    Books in English, as in other languages, are many and finely selected,  though some departments are incomplete. A month's preparation here for  a trip to Russia and the far North was one of unalloyed pleasure; and  many volumes from the library were, under the rules, kindly permitted  to reach and remain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#6)"],[1," carried  down the cups when they had finished, shook the table-cloth out of the  window, carefully collected crumbs from the floor, so as to preserve  their record for neatness, then gathered round the table again for an  hour's fun before the bell should ring for prep.    \"It's a Valentine party, and I've got a ripping idea,\" said Gowan.  \"We'll put our names on pieces of paper, fold them up, shuffle them and  draw them; then each of us must write a valentine to the one we've  drawn. We'll shuffle these, and one of us must read them all out. Then  we must each guess who's written our valentines.\"    \"Sounds rather brainy, doesn't it?\" objected Noreen. \"I don't think I'm  any hand at poetry!\"    \"Oh! you can make up something if you try. Valentines are generally  doggerel.\"    \"Need it be quite original?\" asked Edith.    \"Well, if you really _can't_ compose anything, we'll allow quotations.\"    \"Cracker mottoes?\" suggested Dulcie.    \"Exactly. They're just about in the right style.\"    \"Are you all getting into a sentimental vein?\" giggled Bertha. \"Remember  'Love' rhymes with 'Dove,' and Cupid with--with--\"    \"Stupid,\" supplied Dulcie laconically.    \"I'm not going to give my rhymes away beforehand,\" said Phillida. \"Is  that shuffling business finished, Gowan? Then bags me first draw.\"    Each girl, having been apportioned the name of her valentine, set to  work to compose a suitable ode in her honor. There was much knitting of  brows and nibbling of pencils, and demands for a few minutes longer,  when Gowan called \"Time!\" At last, however, the effusions were all  finished, folded, shuffled, and laid in a pile. Gowan, as the  originator of the game, was unanimously elected president. She drew one  at a venture, opened it, and read:        \"TO PHILLIDA        \"Fair maiden, who in ancient song       Was wont to flout her swain,       I prithee be not always coy,       But turn your face again.       My heart is true, and it will rue,       That ever you should doubt me,       So sweet, be kind, and change your mind,       And don't for ever flout me.\"    \"Who wrote that?\" asked Phillida, glancing keenly round the circle.  \"Noreen, I believe you're looking conscious! I always suspect people who  say they can't write.\"    \"_I!_ No, indeed!\" declared Noreen.    \"You may make guesses, but nobody's to confess or deny authorship till  the end,\" put in Gowan hastily. \"Remember, valentines are always  supposed to be anonymous. Now I'm going to read another.        \"TO LILIAS        \"Cupid with his fatal dart       Shot me through and made me smart,       So I pray, before we part,       Kiss me once, and heal my heart!\"    \"Short and sweet!\" commented Edith.    \"Very sweet--quite sugary, in fact,\" agreed Lilias. \"It's the sort of  motto you get out of a superior cracker with gelatine paper on the  outside, and trinkets inside. There ought to be a ring with all that. I  believe it's Prissie's, but I'm not sure it isn't by Bertha.\"    \"You mayn't have two guesses!\" reminded Gowan, reaching for another  paper. \"Hallo! this actually to me! I feel quite shy!\"    \"Go on! You're not usually afflicted with shyness,\" urged the others.        \"TO GOWAN        \"Wee modest, crimson-tipped flower,       Thou'st met me in an evil hour;       For I maun gang far frae thy bower,       And leave thee greeting 'mang the stour.       But lassie, thou art no thy lane,       This heart is also brak in twain,       And like to burst with grief and pain       To think I'll see thee ne'er again.\"    \"H'm! He might have signed 'Robbie Burns' at the end of it!\" commented  Gowan. \"Seems to take it for granted I'm doing half of the grieving. No,  thanks! I prefer to 'flout them' like Phillida. He may go away with his  old broken heart if he likes. That's not my idea of a valentine.\"    \"There were bad valentines as well as good ones, weren't there?\"  twinkled Dulcie.    \"Certainly; and if I set this down to you, perhaps I'll not be far out.  Who comes next? Oh! Bertha.        \"TO BERTHA        \"I have a little heart to let,       As nice as nice can be;       It's vacant just at present,       On a yearly tenancy.       It's quite completely furnished       With affection's choicest store,       Sweet nothings by the bushel,       And kisses by the score.       It sadly wants a tenant,       This little heart of mine,       So I beg that you will take it,       And be my Valentine!\"    \"Edith! Dulcie! Phillida!--Oh! I can't guess!\" laughed Bertha. \"There's  not the least clue! Go on, Gowan! I'll plump for Phillida.\"    The next on the list was--        \"TO NOREEN        \"Cupid on his rosy wing       Flits to offer you a ring:       Take it, dear, and happy make       One who'd die for your sweet sake!\"    \"That's the sugary type again, and suggests a cracker!\" decided Noreen.  \"You feel there ought to be a big dish of trifle somewhere near.\"    \"I wish there were!\" chirped Edith. \"You haven't guessed yet!\"    \"Oh, well, I guess you!\"    \"I hope it's my turn next,\" said Prissie.    \"No, it happens to be Dulcie,\" retorted Gowan. \"You'll probably be the  last of all.        \"TO DULCIE        \"Oh, lady fair from Cheverley Chase,       The day when first I saw your face       Put me in such a fearful flutter       I could do naught but moan and mutter.       Whether I'm standing on my head,       Or if I'm on my heels instead,       I scarce can tell, for Cupid's arrows       Have made my brain like any sparrow's.       When you come near, my foolish heart       Goes pit-a-pat with throb and start,       And when I try my love to utter,       My fairest speech is but a stutter.       How to propose is all my task,       Whether to write or just to ask,       And ere I solve the problem knotty       I really fear I shall go dotty.       Oh, lady fair, in pity stop       And list while I the question pop.       'Tis here on paper; think it over,       And let me be your humble lover.\"    \"Quite the longest of them all!\" smiled Dulcie complacently.    \"But not as poetical as mine!\" contended Noreen.    \"Oh, go on!\" said Edith. \"I'm sure I'm next!\"    And so she was.        \"TO EDITH        \"Maiden of the swan-like neck,       I am at your call and beck;       If you will but wave a finger,       In your neighborhood I'll linger,       Praise your eyes, and cheeks of roses,       Bring you presents of sweet posies,       Sweetheart, if you will be mine,       Let me be your Valentine!\"    \"I haven't got a swan neck! It's no longer than other people's, I'm  sure!\" protested Edith indignantly, looking round the circle for the  offender. \"Who wrote such stuff?\"    \"There, don't get excited, child!\" soothed Gowan. \"'Edith of the Swan  Neck' was a historical character. Don't you remember? She ought to have  married King Harold, only she didn't, somehow. It's meant as a  compliment, no doubt!\"    \"I believe you wrote it yourself!\"    \"No, I didn't. At least I mustn't tell just yet. I'm going to read the  last one now.        \"TO PRISSIE        \"I am not sentimental, please,         I cannot write in rhyme,       I beg you'll all ecstatics leave         Until another time.        \"But if I'm lacking in romance,         At least my heart is true,       And in its own prosaic way,         It only beats for you.        \"'Mong damsels all I think you are         The nicest little Missie,       And beg to have for Valentine         That sweetest maid, Miss Prissie.\"    \"Author! Author!\" cried Prissie. \"It's Lilias, I do believe!\"    \"Guessing's been horribly wrong!\" said Gowan. \"Only about one of you was  right. Shall I read the list?        \"To Phillida by Dulcie.       To Lilias by Noreen.       To Gowan by myself.       To Bertha by Phillida.       To Noreen by Prissie.       To Dulcie by Bertha.       To Edith by Lilias.       To Prissie by Edith.\"    \"So you wrote your own, Gowan! What a humbug you are! You quite put us  off the scent!\"    \"Well, I drew my own name, you see. I had to write something! Bertha  ought to have a prize for guessing right, only we've nothing to give  her. Shall we play something else?\"    \"Prissie's brought a pack of cards, and she says she'll tell our  fortunes,\" proclaimed Edith.    \"I learnt how in the holidays,\" confessed Prissie. \"A girl was staying  with us who had a book about it. We used to have ripping fun every  evening over it. Whose fortune shall I tell first? Oh, don't all speak  at once! Look here, you'd better each cut, and the lowest shall win.\"    Dulcie, who turned up an ace, was the lucky one, and was therefore  elected as the first to consult the oracle. By Prissie's orders she  shuffled the cards, then handed them back to the sorceress, who laid  them out face upward in rows, and after a few moments' meditation began  her prophecies.    \"You're fair, and therefore the Queen of Diamonds is your representative  card--all the luck's behind you instead of facing you. I see a  disappointment and great changes. A dark woman is coming into your life.  She's connected somehow with money, but there are hearts behind her.  You'll take a journey by land, and find trouble and perplexity.\"    \"Haven't you anything nicer to tell me than that?\" pouted Dulcie. \"Who's  the dark woman?\"    \"She seems to be a relation, by the way the cards are placed.\"    \"I haven't any dark relations. They're all as fair as fair--the whole  family.\"    \"It's silly nonsense! I don't believe in it!\" declared Lilias  emphatically.    \"I dare say it is, but it's fun, all the same. Do tell mine now,  Prissie!\" urged Noreen, gathering up the cards and reshuffling them.    Before the fates could be further consulted, however, the big bell  clanged for preparation, and the magician was obliged to pocket her  cards, hurry downstairs, get out her lesson books, and write a piece of  French translation, while the inquirers into her mysteries also  separated, some to practise piano or violin, and some to study.    \"A dark woman!\" scoffed Dulcie, spilling the "]]]
