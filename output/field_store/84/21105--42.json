A Spartan was not considered to have reached the full age of manhood  till he had completed his thirtieth year.  He was then allowed to  marry, to take part in the public assembly, and was eligible to the  offices of the state.  But he still continued under the public  discipline, and was not permitted even to reside and take his meals  with his wife.  It was not till he had reached his sixtieth year that  he was released from the public discipline and from military service.    The public mess--called SYSSITIA--is said to have been instituted by  Lycurgus to prevent all indulgence of the appetite.  Public tables were  provided, at which every male citizen was obliged to take his meals.  Each table accommodated fifteen persons, who formed a separate mess,  into which no new member was admitted, except by the unanimous consent  of the whole company.  Each sent monthly to the common stock a  specified quantity of barley-meal, wine, cheese, and figs and a little  money to buy flesh and fish. No distinction of any kind was allowed at  these frugal meals. Meat was only eaten occasionally; and one of the  principal dishes was black broth.  Of what it consisted we do not know.  The tyrant Dionysius found it very unpalatable; but, as the cook told  him, the broth was nothing without the seasoning of fatigue and hunger.    The Spartan women in their earlier years were subjected to a course of  training almost as rigorous as that of the men, and contended with each  other in running, wrestling and boxing.  At the age of twenty a Spartan  woman usually married, and she was no longer subjected to the public  discipline.  Although she enjoyed little of her husband's society, she  was treated by him with deep respect, and was allowed a greater degree  of liberty than was tolerated in other Grecian states.  Hence she took  a lively interest in the welfare and glory of her native land, and was  animated by an earnest and lofty spirit of patriotism.  The Spartan  mother had reason to be proud of herself and of her children.  When a  woman of another country said to Gorgo, the wife of Leonidas, \"The  Spartan women alone rule the men,\" she replied, \"The Spartan women  alone bring forth men.\"  Their husbands and their sons were fired by  their sympathy to deeds of heroism.  \"Return either with your shield,  or upon it,\" was their exhortation to their sons when going to battle.    Lycurgus is said to have divided the land belonging to the Spartans  into 9000 equal lots and the remainder of Laconia into 30,000 equal  lots, and to have assigned to each Spartan citizen one of the former of  these lots, and to each Perioecus one of the latter.    Neither gold nor silver money was allowed in Sparta, and nothing but  bars of iron passed in exchange for every commodity.  As the Spartans  were not permitted to engage in commerce, and all luxury and display in  dress, furniture, and food was forbidden, they had very little occasion  for a circulating medium, and iron money was found sufficient for their  few wants.  But this prohibition of the precious metals only made the  Spartans more anxious to obtain them; and even in the times of their  greatest glory the Spartans were the most venal of the Greeks, and  could rarely resist the temptation of a bribe.    The legislation of Lycurgus was followed by important results. It made  the Spartans a body of professional soldiers, all trained and well  disciplined, at a time when military training and discipline were  little known, and almost unpractised in the other states of Greece.  The consequence was the rapid growth of the political power of Sparta,  and the subjugation of the neighbouring states.  At the time of  Lycurgus the Spartans held only a small portion of Laconia:  they were  merely a garrison in the heart of an enemy's country.  Their first  object was to make themselves masters of Laconia, in which they finally  succeeded after a severe struggle.  They next turned their arms against  the Messenians, Arcadians, and Argives.  Of these wars the two waged  against Messenia were the most celebrated and the most important. They  were both long protracted and obstinately contested.  They both ended  in the victory of Sparta, and in the subjugation of Messenia.  These  facts are beyond dispute; but of the details we have no trustworthy  narrative.    The FIRST MESSENIAN WAR lasted from B.C. 743 to 724.  During the first  four years the Lacedaemonians made little progress; but in the fifth a  great battle was fought, and although its result was indecisive, the  Messenians did not venture to risk another engagement, and retired to  the strongly fortified mountain of Ithome.  In their distress they sent  to consult the oracle at Delphi, and received the appalling answer that  the salvation of Messenia required the sacrifice of a virgin of the  royal house to the gods of the lower world.  Aristodemus, who is the  Messenian hero of the first war, slew his own daughter, which so  disheartened the Spartans, that they abstained from attacking the  Messenians for some years.  In the thirteenth year of the war the  Spartan king marched against Ithome, and a second great battle was  fought, but the result was again indecisive.  The Messenian king fell  in the action; and Aristodemus, who was chosen king in his place,  prosecuted the war with vigour.  In the fifth year of his reign a third  great battle was fought.  This time the Messenians gained a decisive  victory, and the Lacedaemonians were driven back into their own  territory.  They now sent to ask advice of the Delphian oracle, and  were promised success upon using stratagem.  They therefore had  recourse to fraud:  and at the same time various prodigies dismayed the  bold spirit of Aristodemus.  His daughter too appeared to him in a  dream, showed him her wounds, and beckoned him away.  Seeing that his  country was doomed to destruction, Aristodemus slew himself on his  daughter's tomb.  Shortly afterwards, in the twentieth year of the war,  the Messenians abandoned Ithome, which the Lacedaemonians razed to the  ground, and the whole country became subject to Sparta.  Many of the  inhabitants fled into other countries; but those who remained were  reduced to the condition of Helots, and were compelled to pay to their  masters half of the produce of their lands.    For thirty-nine years the Messenians endured this degrading yoke. At  the end of this time they took up arms against their oppressors.  The  SECOND MESSENIAN WAR lasted from B.C. 685 to 668.  Its hero is  Aristomenes, whose wonderful exploits form the great subject of this  war.  It would appear that most of the states in Peloponnesus took part  in the struggle.  The first battle was fought before the arrival of the  allies on either side, and, though it was indecisive, the valour of  Aristomenes struck fear into the hearts of the Spartans.  To frighten  the enemy still more, the hero crossed the frontier, entered Sparta by  night, and affixed a shield to the temple of Athena (Minerva), with the  inscription, \"Dedicated by Aristomenes to the goddess from the Spartan  spoils.\"  The Spartans in alarm sent to Delphi for advice.  The god  bade them apply to Athens for a leader. Fearing to disobey the oracle,  but with the view of rendering no real assistance, the Athenians sent  Tyrtaeus, a lame man and a schoolmaster.  The Spartans received their  new leader with due honour; and he was not long in justifying the  credit of the oracle.  His martial songs roused their fainting courage;  and so efficacious were his poems that to them is mainly ascribed the  final success of the Spartan arms.    Encouraged by the strains of Tyrtaeus, the Spartans again marched  against the Messenians.  But they were not at first successful. A great  battle was fought at the Boar's Grave in the plain of Stenyclerus, in  which they were defeated with great loss.  In the third year of the war  another great battle was fought, in which the Messenians suffered a  signal defeat.  So greet was their loss, that Aristomenes no longer  ventured to meet the Spartans in the open field.  Following the example  of the Messenian leaders in the former war, he retired to the mountain  fortress of Ira. The Spartans encamped at the foot of the mountain; but  Aristomenes frequently sallied from the fortress, and ravaged the lands  of Laconia with fire and sword.  It is unnecessary to relate all the  wonderful exploits of this hero in his various incursions.  Thrice was  he taken prisoner; on two occasions he burst his bonds, but on the  third he was carried to Sparta, and thrown with his fifty companions  into a deep pit, called Ceadas. His comrades were all killed by the  fall; but Aristomenes reached the bottom unhurt.  He saw, however, no  means of escape, and had resigned himself to death; but on the third  day perceiving a fox creeping among the bodies, he grasped its tail,  and, following the animal as it struggled to escape, discovered an  opening in the rock, and on the next day was at Ira to the surprise  alike of friends and foes.  But his single prowess was not sufficient  to avert the ruin of his country.  One night the Spartans surprised  Ira, while Aristomenes was disabled by a wound; but he collected the  bravest of his followers, and forced his way through the enemy.  Many  of the Messenians went to Rhegium, in Italy, under the sons of  Aristomenes, but the hero himself finished his days in Rhodes.    The second Messenian war was terminated by the complete subjugation of  the Messenians, who again became the serfs of their conquerors.  In  this condition they remained till the restoration of their independence  by Epaminondas in the year 369 B.C. During the whole of the intervening  period the Messenians disappear from history.  The country called  Messenia in the map became a portion of Laconia, which thus extended  across the south of Pelponnesus from the eastern to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20967"],[0,"A Guide to Peterborough Cathedral (#6)"],[1,"--a Kirk,  and a tun under it. This gate is a magnificent specimen of  architecture, and should be seen by every person who visits  Peterborough. Abbot Kirton ruled nearly 32 years, and died in 1528.    John Chambers was the last abbot, and was elected in 1528.    Cardinal Wolsey visited the abbey in the 17th year of the reign of  Henry the Eighth, and washed and kissed the feet of fifty-nine poor  people, which ceremony was called \"keeping his maundy.\" He then gave  them twelve pence, three ells of canvas, a pair of shoes, and divided a  barrel of red herrings amongst them: he likewise sang mass himself on  Easter-day, and absolved from their sins all those who heard him.    It was during the rule of Chambers that Queen Catherine, the first wife  of Henry the 8th, died [July 1, 1535], and was buried in the monastery.  Her tomb may be seen in the north side of the choir. The scaff which  covered her pall was originally deposited at the back of the great  altar. It was inwoven with silver, and was very massive and heavy.            [7] This sum made the church dependent upon the monastery, and        the chaplain was required to bring his church key to the sacrist        of the monastery, yearly, as an acknowledgement of it.--_See        Gunton's Hist. Church, Peterborough, p. 24._          [8] Britton says \"he founded a chapel to St. Nicholas _near_        it;\" but Gunton is doubtless correct, when he says that the        chapel was over it.          [9] After Acharius had recovered the marsh of Singlesholt from        the Abbot of Crowland by the law of the land, he let it to him        with the understanding that, instead of his paying four stones of        wax to the Abbot of Crowland, the abbot should pay him a yearly        rental in kind, of the same amount.          [10] These decrees were, that all churches not consecrated with        holy oil, should be dedicated within two years.--_See Britton's        Hist. Cathedral Church, Peterborough, pp. 22-3._          [11] There was at one time an entrance from the Choir into the        Lady Chapel through a door, on the right side of which was a        small oratory, with a stone roof; the remains are yet to be seen.          [12] This hospital was afterwards called Spittle, and some of the        stones are still remaining in Spittle-field. It was left by Agnes        Pudding, with eight acres of arable land adjoining it.          [13] The Prince at first refused the robe offered to him, because        the abbot did not make a similar offer to his companion; Godfrey,        however, soon settled the affair, by presenting one to each.          [14] A gentleman in this city who is an excellent antiquarian,        and has seen the corrody alluded to above, says, \"It was granted        by charter of the abbot, and presents many curiosities--mentioning        particularly the abbot's wine cellar at the over end of the        cloister, under the present passage into the square.\"--_Private        MS._          [15] The abbot was indicted at the sessions at _Peterburgh_        before Guy Woolston.--_Private MS._          [16] It is still commonly, but incorrectly, called The Lady        Chapel. A building of corresponding position at Lincoln is called        the Presbytry.          CHAPTER III.    _From the transformation of the monastery into a Cathedral during the  rule of abbot Chambers, in 1541, to the present time._      The dissolution of the religious houses of England is one of the most  important events recorded in our national history. It changed the whole  aspect of civil and ecclesiastical affairs, and produced an entire  revolution in the scheme of legislation.    John Chambers, who was the abbot of _Peterburgh_ before these changes  commenced, conformed to the new order of things, and was retained in  office by the king,--the monastery being converted into a cathedral,  and the abbot into a bishop. The new establishment consisted of a  Bishop, a Dean, and six canons; besides these the statutes directed  that there should be six Minor Canons chosen, among other good  qualifications, for their skill in singing, by whom the services in the  Cathedral, were to be conducted, according to the usage of the old  Cathedrals. Of these, one was to be chosen as Precentor, to whom the  other Minor Canons, the Organists, Lay Clerks, and Choristers, were to  be subordinate. The chancel of Thomas a Becket's Chapel, already spoken  of, was then converted into a school-room, in which the Choristers, and  a certain number of other boys, were to receive a classical education  at the hands of one of the Minor Canons appointed, for his superior  learning, to the office of schoolmaster. Chambers governed 15 years in  his new office. There is some dispute amongst the historians of this  church about the time of his death, but it is generally agreed that the  tablet to his memory is dated wrong, and that he died in 1556. There  were two monuments erected to him, by his own orders, before his death;  and this circumstance may account for the error in the date upon the  tablets. One of the monuments was a beautifully executed statue of  himself, in white chalk, but it was destroyed in 1643. The bishop  adorned the doors of the church with carved images and hieroglyphics,  one of which at the west front represents a sinner tormented by devils,  though it is now much defaced.    From the death of Bishop Chambers to the accession of Richard Howland,  in 1584, nothing of importance occurred. It was during his rule that  the unhappy queen of Scots fell a victim to the vanity and jealousy of  Elizabeth, in the castle of Fotheringhay.[17]    \"Although that unfortunate Queen had been executed on the 8th of  February, her body was not brought to Peterborough for burial till the  night of the thirtieth of July following, when it was conveyed by  torch-light from Fotheringhay Castle by Garter King at Arms, and other  Heralds, with a guard of horsemen, in a chariot made for the purpose,  covered with black cloth. The corpse was met at the entrance of the  cathedral by the bishop, Richard Howland, and Fletcher, the dean of the  cathedral, with others, who attended it in solemn procession to the  vault appointed for it, in which it was immediately deposited. The  vault was then covered, an opening merely being left through which the  Heralds might deposit their broken staves. No service was said at the  time, as it was agreed that it had better be done on the day fixed for  the solemnization of the funeral. On the day following, there came to  Peterborough all those persons of rank appointed to attend the funeral,  for whom a grand supper was prepared at the bishop's palace. On  Tuesday, the first of August, 1586, being the day fixed for the  funeral, they all marched in order to the church, the Countess of  Bedford being chief mourner. The funeral service was performed by the  Dean of Peterborough; the prebendaries and choir of the Cathedral then  sang an anthem, after which a sermon was preached by Wickham, Bishop of  Lincoln. The officers having broken their staves and cast them into the  vault, and the offerings appointed having been made to the Bishop and  Dean and Chapter of Peterborough, the nobility and officers, who had  attended the funeral, returned to the bishop's palace, where a  sumptuous repast was provided, after which they all returned to their  respective homes.    \"The place where this queen was interred, is now marked by a marble slab  directly under the doorway leading from the choir into its south aisle.  Over this was erected a superb monument to her memory, which remained  perfect until the time of the great rebellion.    \"After the queen's body had lain at Peterborough about 25 years, her  son, James I., wishing to have it removed to Westminster Abbey, wrote  to the Dean and Chapter of Peterborough, requesting them to allow of  the removal.[18] The corpse was accordingly taken from its grave at  Peterborough, and removed to the place where it now lies, at  Westminster, under the care of Richard Neile, Bishop of Coventry and  Lichfield, on October 11th, 1612.\"    The next event of public interest happened during the bishopric of John  Towers, in 1643; namely, the destruction and defacement of all the  monuments and ornamental pictures of the cathedral, through the foolish  prejudices and blinded bigotry of the puritanical followers of  Cromwell, who destroyed every thing valuable within it, and spread  terror over the surrounding country. The stately front, the curious  altar-piece, and beautiful cloister, for which the cathedral was  remarkable, were defaced and injured by them as they passed through the  city, on their way to Croyland, which they were going to besiege, it  having declared in favour of the king. To reduce that town, the  Parliamentarian forces marched through Peterborough about the middle of  the month of April. The first regiment that came did no harm to the  church, for, being commanded by one Hubbart, who seems to have been a  great improvement upon the puritanical leaders of that time, the  soldiers received orders, in no way to injure the Cathedral. But  unfortunately, about two days after, a regiment of horse arrived,  commanded by Colonel Cromwell; and these men the morning after their  arrival, commenced the work of destruction. They broke open the doors  of the church, demolished the monuments, and turned the building into a  stable.    The fury of Cromwell's soldiers is thus described in an old paper  called:--    \"_A short and true narrative of the Rising and Defacing the Cathedral  Church of Peterborough, in the year 1643._\"    \"The next day after their arrival, early in the morning, they break  open the church doors, pull down the organs, of which there were two  pair. The greater pair which stood upon a high loft over the entrance  into the quire, was thence thrown down upon the ground, and then  stamped and trampled on, and broke in"]]]
