INTRODUCTION.      In laying before the public the following history of the Indian  Mammalia, I am actuated by the feeling that a popular work on the  subject is needed, and would be appreciated by many who do not care  to purchase the expensive books that exist, and who also may be more  bothered than enlightened by over-much technical phraseology and  those learned anatomical dissertations which are necessary to the  scientific zoologist.    Another motive in thus venturing is, that the only complete history  of Indian Mammalia is Dr. Jerdon's, which is exhaustive within the  boundaries he has assigned to India proper; but as he has excluded  Assam, Cachar, Tenasserim, Burmah, Arracan, and Ceylon, his book is  incomplete as a Natural History of the Mammals of British India. I  shall have to acknowledge much to Jerdon in the following pages, and  it is to him I owe much encouragement, whilst we were together in  the field during the Indian Mutiny, in the pursuit of the study to  which he devoted his life; and the general arrangement of this work  will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],[0,"The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#6)"],[1,"the bolt back. Guard against this.    Being at inspection arms: 1. Order (or right shoulder, or port), 2.  ARMS.    At the preparatory command (i.e., at the command order), push the bolt  forward, turn the handle down, pull the trigger, and resume port arms.  At the command arms, complete the movement ordered.        TO DISMISS THE SQUAD      Being at a halt: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Port, 4. ARMS, 5.  DISMISSED.    Make a point of becoming sufficiently familiar with the different parts  of the rifle to obey the following general rules governing the manual.    The following rules govern the carrying of the piece:    First. the piece is not carried with cartridges in either the chamber or  the magazine except when specifically ordered. When so loaded, or  supposed to be loaded, it is habitually carried locked; that is, with  the safety lock turned to the \"safe.\" At all other times it is carried  unlocked with the trigger pulled.    Second. Whenever troops are formed under arms, pieces are immediately  inspected at the commands: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Order (right  shoulder, port), 4. ARMS.    A similar inspection is made immediately before dismissal.    If cartridges are found in the chamber or magazine they are removed and  placed in the belt.    Third. The cut-off is kept turned \"off\" except when cartridges are  actually used.    Fourth. The bayonet is not fixed except in bayonet exercise, on guard,  or for combat.    Fifth. Fall in is executed with the piece at the order arms. Fall  out, rest, and at ease are executed as without arms. On resuming  attention the position of order arms is taken.    Sixth. If at the order, unless otherwise prescribed, the piece is  brought to the right shoulder at the command march, the three motions  corresponding with the first three steps. Movements may be executed at  the trail by prefacing the preparatory command with the words at  trail; as, 1. At trail, forward, 2. MARCH; the trail is taken at the  command march.    When the facings, alignments, open and close ranks, taking interval or  distance, and assemblings are executed from the order, raise the piece  to the trail while in motion and resume the order on halting.    Seventh. The piece is brought to the order on halting. The execution of  the order begins when the halt is completed.    Eighth. A disengaged hand in double time is held as when without arms.    The following rules govern the execution of the manual of arms:    First. In all positions of the left hand at the balance (center of  gravity, bayonet unfixed) the thumb clasps the piece; the sling is  included in the grasp of the hand.    Second. In all positions of the piece, \"diagonally across the body\" the  position of the piece, left arm and hand are the same as in port arms.    Third. In resuming the order from any position in the manual, the motion  next to the last concludes with the butt of the piece about 3 inches  from the ground, barrel to the rear, the left hand above and near the  right, steadying the piece, fingers extended and joined, forearm and  wrist straight and inclining downward, all fingers of the right hand  grasping the piece. To complete the order, lower the piece gently to the  ground with the right hand, drop the left quickly by the side, and take  the position of order arms.    Allowing the piece to drop through the right hand to the ground, or  other similar abuse of the rifle to produce effect in executing the  manual, is prohibited.    Fourth. The cadence of the motions is that of quick time; the recruits  are first required to give their whole attention to the details of the  motions, the cadence being gradually acquired as they become accustomed  to handling their pieces. The instructor may require them to count aloud  in cadence with the motions.    Fifth. The manual is taught at a halt and the movements are, for the  purpose of instruction, divided into motions and executed in detail; in  this case the command of execution determines the prompt execution of  the first motion, and the commands, two, three, four, that of the  other motions.    To execute the movements in detail, the instructor first cautions: By  the numbers; all movements divided into motions are then executed as  above explained until he cautions: Without the numbers; or commands  movements other than those in the manual of arms.    Sixth. Whenever circumstances require, the regular positions of the  manual of arms and the firings may be ordered without regard to the  previous position of the piece.    Under exceptional conditions of weather or fatigue the rifle may be  carried in any manner directed.          CHAPTER IV    SCHOOL OF THE SQUAD    Based on the Infantry Drill Regulations        CLOSE ORDER DRILLS      For several days after reporting you will undergo many hours of close  order drill. You will ask yourself, \"Why is all this mental and physical  strain necessary when these exercises are not used in battle?\" The  answer is: they are disciplinary exercises and are designed to inculcate  that prompt and subconscious obedience which is essential to proper  military control and to teach you precise and soldierly movements;  hence, they are executed at attention.        DEFINITIONS      Deploy. To extend the front. A squad deploys when it goes \"As  skirmishers.\" A company likewise deploys when it goes from column into  line.    File. Two men, the front rank man and the corresponding man in the  rear rank. The front rank man is the file leader. A file which has no  rear rank man is a blank file.    Interval. Space between elements of the same line. The interval  between men in ranks is 4 inches and is measured from elbow to elbow. It  is to get this interval that each man is required to raise his arm when  the company is formed.    Distance. Space between elements in the direction of depth. It is  measured from the back of the man in front to the breast of the man in  rear. The rear rank when in line or column is 40 inches from the front  rank.    The guide of a squad in line is right unless otherwise announced.    The guide of a squad deployed, (i.e., skirmishers) is center unless  otherwise announced.        TO FORM THE SQUAD      To form the squad the instructor places himself 3 paces in front of  where the center is to be and commands: Fall in.    The men assemble at attention, pieces at the order, and are arranged by  the corporal in double rank, as nearly as practicable in order of height  from right to left, each man dropping his left hand as soon as the man  on his left has his interval. The rear rank forms with distance of 40  inches.    The instructor then commands: Count off.    At this command all except the right file execute eyes right, and  beginning on the right, the men in each rank count one, two, three,  four--one, two, three, four; each man turns his head and eyes to the  front as he counts.    Pieces are then inspected.    [Illustration]    The purpose of putting the left hand on the hip is to get enough elbow  room. A man should have sufficient space to operate his piece. These  four-inch intervals give it to him.    [Illustration]    Note the space between elbows (interval) is 4 inches. The space between  the front and rear rank (distance) is 40 inches, and is measured from  the back of the man in front to the breast of the man in the rear.        ALIGNMENTS      To align the squad, the base file or files having been established: 1.  Right (left), 2. DRESS, 3. FRONT.    At the command dress, all men place the left hand upon the hip (whether  dressing to the right or left); each man, except the base file, when on  or near the new lines executes eyes right, and, taking steps of 2 or 3  inches, places himself so that his right arm rests lightly against the  elbow of the man on his right (vice versa in left dressing), and so that  his eyes and shoulders are in line with those of the men on his right,  and also that each man can see the eyes of at least two men on his  right.    [Illustration]    The instructor verifies the alignment of both ranks from the right flank  and orders up or back such men as may be in the rear, or in advance, of  the line; only the men designated move.    At the command front, given when the ranks are aligned, each man turns  his head and eyes to the front and drops his left hand by his side.    There are in dressing a number of common errors that we should try to  avoid. Don't jab the man on your left with your elbow. If you are not on  the line, move your feet. Don't lean forward or backward. Be sure to  touch gently the man on your right with your right arm. Be certain to  keep your left elbow forced well to the front. This is a little  uncomfortable at first, but unless we do this our arms will not measure  the 4 inches correctly. Don't hump up the left shoulder, and don't turn  the shoulders to the right. Keep fingers of left hand extended and  joined.    We want to place especial stress on the importance of three movements  in the school of the squad. When you have thoroughly mastered these  three, you will have a splendid basis for the remainder of the School of  the Squad, the full value of which you will later appreciate. These are:  Squad right, Squad right about, and Right turn.    The first line drawing in this chapter shows correct proportions of  interval and distance. To save space and for convenience, the drawings  hereafter are made without regard to proportions (intervals and  distances).        First Movement      SQUAD RIGHT    Being in line, to turn and march: 1. Squad right (left), 2. MARCH.    In this movement many instructors have recruit squads step off on the  7th count. When the drill progresses the squad should step off on the  5th count.    [Illustration: This is what we have    This is what we want]    At the command march, No. 1 in the front rank faces to the right in  marching and marks time; Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of the front rank turn 45  degrees to the right (right"]]]
