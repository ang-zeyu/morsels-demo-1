Jardell.\"    \"Let us go back to town and see if we can catch him by long distance  'phone or by telegraph.\"    Shaking his head sadly, Randolph Rover turned his buggy around and  followed the boys to the central office of the telephone company. Here  all was activity on account of the broken-down wires, but communications  were being gradually resumed. They looked into the telephone book, and  at last got a connection which, a few minutes later, put them into  communication with Andrew D. Jardell's private residence in the city.    \"Is Mr. Jardell at home?\" asked Dick, who was doing the telephoning.    \"Mr. Jardell is away,\" was the answer.    \"Is he at or near Carwell, New York state?\"    \"No, he is in Paris, and has been for two weeks.\"    \"You are sure of this?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Who are you?\"    \"I am Mrs. Jardell. Who are you?\"    \"My name is Richard Rover. My uncle, Randolph Rover, has been swindled  out of some traction company bonds by a man who said he was Mr.  Jardell.\"    \"Mercy me! You don't say so! Well, my husband had nothing to do with it,  you may be sure. He went to London first and then to Paris, and in a day  or two he is to start for Switzerland. His health is very poor and the  doctor said he needed the trip.\"    Some more talk followed, and Mrs. Jardell advised Dick to communicate  with the traction company at once, and he said he would do so.    \"It wasn't Mr. Jardell at all, Uncle Randolph,\" said the youth, as he  hung up the receiver. \"The whole thing was a cleverly-planned swindle,  and unless you can get the bonds back you'll be out the money.\"    At this announcement Mr. Rover nearly collapsed--for he was rather a  retired man, and had had little to do in a business way since his trip  to Africa with the boys, as related in \"The Rover Boys in the Jungle.\"  He did not know what to do, and stood rubbing his hands nervously.    \"The swindlers!\" he murmured. \"Really, it is getting so that nobody can  be trusted!\"    \"The best thing we can do is to send word to the various towns to stop  the runabout with the two men in it on sight and have the rascals held  by the authorities,\" said Dick, who felt he must take charge of affairs.    \"That's the talk!\" cried Tom, \"and the sooner we get at it the better.\"    \"Let us find out where that side road leads to,\" added Sam, \"I mean the  road on which we heard the auto.\"    Inside of an hour various messages had been sent by telephone and  telegraph. It was now growing late and the Rovers hardly knew what to do  next. From their uncle the boys got the whole tale concerning the bonds,  but the new light shed on the subject did not help matters.    They also told the authorities about the cave and the boxes stored  there, and some men were at once sent off to investigate and take  possession of whatever could be found.    \"I think some of us ought to go home,\" said Sam. \"Aunt Martha won't go  to bed until we get back, and she will be greatly worried.\"    It was finally decided that Tom and Dick should remain at the Carwell  hotel over night and Sam and his uncle should go home in the buggy. The  team was put up at the hotel barn, and then all hands went to the dining  room for a late supper.    \"I'm as hungry as two bears,\" announced Tom.    \"Well, I shan't say no to a good feed,\" answered Sam.    Randolph Rover could eat but little. Now that he realized what had  occurred, he upbraided himself bitterly for having been so deluded.    \"They talked about scientific farming just to get me into good humor,\"  he said, bitterly. \"I see it all! Oh, if I can only get my hands on  them!\"    After Mr. Rover and Sam had departed, Dick and Tom wandered around the  hotel and the vicinity for three hours. They anxiously awaited some  message regarding the two swindlers, but nothing came. Then, worn out by  the strenuous day they had put in, they went to bed and slept soundly  until morning.    Before having breakfast they asked for messages. There was one from a  village called Bahan, saying a green runabout with two men had passed  through there about midnight. But the men had not been captured, and it  was not known what had become of them.    At noon the telephone line between Oak Run and Carwell was in working  order once more, and the boys sent word home. Then they left directions  at the hotel, so that any messages coming in might be transmitted to the  Rover farm.    \"Well, I never!\" cried Dick, suddenly.    \"What now?\" asked his brother.    \"That freight thief, and that stuff in the cave----\"    \"Humph! it slipped my mind entirely. I was thinking only of Uncle  Randolph's bonds.\"    \"Let us find out if anything has been done.\"    At the local police headquarters they found that a wagon had just come  in, loaded with the three full boxes of goods located at the cave. A  search was still in progress for Dangler, but so far he had not been  located.    \"This clears up the mystery of the freight thefts,\" said an officer to  the boys. \"I only hope we can get our hands on Bill Dangler.\"    \"You know him?\" asked Dick.    \"Oh, yes. Years ago he used to work for the freight division of the  railroad.\"    \"Do you know anything of this Merrick and the fellow called Pike?\"    \"No, but our idea is that the three men were in the deal together.  Probably this Merrick and this Pike pulled off this affair of the  traction company bonds as a side issue.\"    \"Have the freight robberies been large?\" asked Sam.    \"Not so large at one time, but they have been going on for months, and  the total from four different stations along the line foots up to a good  many thousand dollars.\"    \"Well, I hope we catch all three of the men--and any others who may be  in league with them,\" said Dick, and then he and Tom walked off. A  little later they were on the buckboard and bound for home.    When they arrived at the farm they found that their uncle had sent a  long letter to the officers of the traction company, relating in full  what had occurred. In return the officials of the concern said they  would put a private detective on the case, and this was done. But weeks  went by and nothing was seen or heard of Merrick and Pike, and what had  become of the missing bonds remained a mystery.    \"I am anxious to take a look at that cave where the stolen freight was  stored,\" said Sam one day. \"Supposing we drive to it?\"    \"That will suit me,\" answered Dick. \"I want to learn about something  else--that red tin box I saw hanging from a tree.\"    \"Oh, yes, I had forgotten about that,\" put in Tom. \"Well, shall we walk  or drive over?\"    It was decided to drive as far as the cave, and not knowing how long  they would be gone, the boys took a lunch along.    \"Now, take care of yourselves,\" warned Randolph Rover. \"Don't fall into  any more holes.\"    \"We'll try to watch out!\" sang out Tom.    Then Dick cracked the whip, and off the team started at a good pace, the  eldest Rover, however, holding them well under control. It was a clear  and beautiful day. The boys did not dream of the odd adventure in store  for them.          CHAPTER VII    A STRANGE LETTER BOX      \"It won't be long now before we'll have to get back to Putnam Hall,\"  observed Sam, as they drove along. \"Dear old school! How I love it!\"    \"It's too bad that we are getting too old to go there,\" said Tom. \"But  we can't be boys always.\"    \"I shall be glad to see the other fellows again,\" came from Dick.    \"Do you know what I think?\" declared Tom. \"I think the Putnam Hall  cadets are the finest lot of boys in the world!\"    \"Throwing bouquets at yourself, Tom?\" said Sam, with a laugh.    \"Well, don't you agree with me?\"    \"I certainly do, Sam, and Captain Putnam is the best teacher in the  world. My, but won't we have fun when we get back!\"    \"We'll have to have a feast in honor of our return,\" said Dick, and  smiled that quiet smile of his which meant so much.    The distance to the cave was soon covered, and the boys tied their team  to a tree in that vicinity. They went inside and found that everything,  even to the empty boxes, had been taken away. The place had been  explored by a number of curiosity seekers.    \"It is queer that this cave wasn't discovered before,\" was Dick's  comment, after they had spent half an hour in walking around.    \"Perhaps the opening to the road wasn't so large formerly,\" suggested  Tom. \"Dangler may have enlarged it, so he could drive in.\"    \"That is true. Well, it will be a regular picnic place after this. Its  fame will spread for miles around.\" And Dick was right, and the cave is  a well-known spot in that portion of New York state to this day.    The boys had brought with them two electric pocket lights, as they are  called--lights they had purchased while on their river outing--and with  these turned on they walked to the extreme rear of the cave and along  the various passageways running up the mountainside.    \"Here is where we dropped in,\" said Dick, pointing out the spot.    \"I wish we could drop out--and land up on the mountain outside,\"  returned his youngest brother. \"Then, maybe, you could locate that tin  lunch box, or whatever it was.\"        \"I'd get up,          Very soon      If I had,          A big balloon!\"    sang out Tom, merrily. \"But as there doesn't seem to be a balloon handy,  what's the matter with trying to climb up?\" he added.    \"And pull down several tons of dirt and rock on your head,\" said Dick.  \"Better go slow. We already know how treacherous these holes are.

But first, Mave,\" said  the king, as he drew the blushing princess to him, \"speak, darling, as  becomes the daughter of a king--speak in the presence of the nobles of  Erin, and say if it is your wish to become Enda's bride.\"    The princess flung her white arms around her father's neck, as she  murmured:    \"Father, it was Enda brought me back to you, and before all the princes  and nobles of Erin I am willing to be his bride.\"    And she buried her head upon the king's breast, and as he stroked her  silken hair falling to her feet, the bards struck their golden harps,  but the sound of the joyous music could hardly drown the murmurs of the  jealous nobles.    When the music ceased the king beckoned Enda to him, and was about to  place his hand in Mave's when a Druid, whose white beard almost touched  the ground, and who had been a favorite of the dead stepmother, and hated  Mave for her sake, stepped forward and said:    \"O king of Erin, never yet has the daughter of a king been freely given  in marriage to any save a battle champion; and that stripling there has  never struck his spear against a warrior's shield.\"    A murmur of approbation rose from the jealous princes, and Congal, the  bravest of them all, stepped out from the ranks, and said:    \"The Druid speaks the truth, O king! That stripling has never faced a  battle champion yet, and, speaking for all the nobles of your land, I  challenge him to fight any one of us; and as he is young and unused to  arms, we are willing that the youngest and least experienced amongst us  should be set against him.\"    When Congal had spoken, the nobles, in approval of his words, struck  their shields with their swords, and the brazen sound ascended to the  skies.    The face of the princess, blushing a moment before like a rose, became  as white as a lily; but the color returned to her cheeks when she heard  Enda's voice ringing loud and clear.    \"It is true, O king!\" said he, \"that I have never used my spear in  battle yet. The Prince Congal has challenged me to meet the youngest and  least experienced of the chiefs of Erin. I have risked my life already  for your daughter's sake. I would face death a thousand times for the  chance of winning her for my bride; but I would scorn to claim her hand  if I dared not meet the boldest battle champion of the nobles of Erin,  and here before you, O king, and bards, Druids, and nobles, and chiefs  of Erin, and here, in the presence of the Lady Mave, I challenge the  boldest of them all.\"    The king's eyes flashed with joy as he listened to the brave words of  Enda.    \"It is well,\" said the king; \"the contest shall take place to-morrow on  the lawn outside our palace gates; but before our assembly dissolves I  call on you, nobles and chiefs of Erin, to name your boldest champion.\"    Loud cries of \"Congal! Congal!\" answered the king's speech.    \"Are you willing, Congal?\" asked the king.    \"Willing, O king!\" answered Congal.    \"It is well,\" said the king. \"We shall all meet again to-night in our  banquet-hall.\"    And the king, with the Princess Mave on his arm, attended by his bards  and Druids, entered the palace, and the chiefs and nobles went their  several ways.    At the feast that night the princess sat beside the king, and Enda  beside the princess, and the bards and Druids, nobles and chiefs, took  their places in due order. And the bards sang songs of love and battle,  and never merrier hours were spent than those which passed away that  night in the banquet-hall of Erin's king.    When the feast was over Enda retired to his apartment to spend the night  dreaming of the Princess Mave, and Congal went to his quarters; but not  to sleep or dream, for the Druid who had provoked the contest came to  him bringing his golden wand, and all night long the Druid was weaving  spells to charm the shield and spear and helmet of Congal, to make them  invulnerable in the battle of the morrow.    But while Enda lay dreaming of the Princess Mave, the little fairy woman  who gave him the water-dress, and crystal helmet, and shining spear on  the banks of the Boyne, slid into his room, and she placed beside his  couch a silver helmet and a silver shield. And she rubbed the helmet,  and the shield, and the blue blade and haft of his spear with the juice  of the red rowan berries, and she let a drop fall upon his face and  hands, and then she slid out as silently as she came.    When the morning broke, Enda sprang from his couch, and he could hardly  believe his eyes when he saw the silver shield and helmet. At the sight  of them he longed for the hour of battle, and he watched with eager gaze  the sun climbing the sky; and, after hours of suspense, he heard the  trumpet's sound and the clangor of the hollow shields, struck by the  hard-pointed spears.    Putting on the helmet, and fastening the shield upon his left arm, and  taking the spear in his right hand, he stepped out bravely to the fight.  The edge of the lawn before the palace gates was ringed by the princes,  nobles, and chiefs of Erin. And the palace walls were thronged by all  the beauties of the Court and all the noble ladies of the land. And on  his throne, surrounded by his Druids, his brehons, and his bards, was  the king of Erin, and at his feet sat the lovely Lady Mave.    As Enda stepped out upon the lawn, he saw Congal advancing from the  ranks of the nobles, and the two champions approached each other until  they met right in front of the throne.    Then both turned towards the throne, and bowed to the king and the  Princess Mave; and then facing each other again, they retired a space,  and when their spears were poised, ready for battle, the king gave the  signal, which was answered by the clang of stricken shields, and Congal  and Enda launched their gleaming spears. They flashed like lightning  in the sunlit air, and in a second Congal's had broken against Enda's  shield; but Enda's, piercing Congal's helmet, hurled him senseless on  the plain.    The nobles and chiefs could hardly realize that in that single second  their boldest champion was overthrown; but when they saw him stretched  motionless on the grassy sward, from out their ranks six warriors  advanced to where the chieftain lay, and sadly they bore him away upon  their battle-shields, and Enda remained victor upon the field.    And then the king's voice rang out clear as the sound of a trumpet in  the still morning:    \"Bards and brehons, princes and nobles, and chiefs of Erin, Enda has  proved himself a battle champion, and who amongst you now will dare  gainsay his right to claim my daughter for his bride?\"    And no answer came.    But when he summoned Enda to his throne, and placed the lady's hand in  his, a cheer arose from the great assembly, that proved that jealousy  was extinguished in all hearts, and that all believed that Enda was  worthy of the winsome bride; and never since that day, although a  thousand years have passed, was there in all the world a brighter and  gayer wedding than the wedding of Enda and the Princess Mave.          THE ENCHANTED CAVE      A long, long time ago, Prince Cuglas,[4] master of the hounds to the  high King of Erin, set out from Tara to the chase. As he was leaving the  palace the light mists were drifting away from the hill-tops, and the  rays of the morning sun were falling aslant on the _grinan_ or sunny  bower of the Princess Ailinn. Glancing towards it the prince doffed his  plumed and jeweled hunting-cap, and the princess answered his salute  by a wave of her little hand, that was as white as a wild rose in the  hedges in June, and leaning from her bower, she watched the huntsman  until his tossing plumes were hidden by the green waving branches of  the woods.    The Princess Ailinn was over head and ears in love with Cuglas, and  Cuglas was over head and ears in love with the Princess Ailinn, and he  believed that never was summer morning half as bright, or as sweet, or  as fair as she. The glimpse which he had just caught of her filled his  heart with delight, and almost put all thought of hunting out of his  head, when suddenly the tuneful cries of the hounds, answered by a  hundred echoes from the groves, broke upon his ear.    The dogs had started a dappled deer that bounded away through the  forest. The prince, spurring his gallant steed, pushed on in eager  pursuit.    On through the forest sped the deer, through soft, green, secret ways  and flowery dells, then out from the forest, up heathery hills, and over  long stretches of moorland, and across brown rushing streams, sometimes  in view of the hounds, sometimes lost to sight, but always ahead of  them.    All day long the chase continued, and at last, when the sun was sinking,  the dogs were close upon the panting deer, and the prince believed he  was about to secure his game, when the deer suddenly disappeared through  the mouth of a cave which opened before him. The dogs followed at his  heels, and the prince endeavored to rein in his steed, but the impetuous  animal bore him on, and soon was clattering over the stony floor of the  cave in perfect darkness. Cuglas could hear ahead of him the cries of  the hounds growing fainter and fainter, as they increased the distance  between them and him. Then the cries ceased altogether, and the only  sound the prince heard was the noise of his horse's hoofs sounding in  the hollow cave. Once more he endeavored to check his career, but the  reins broke in his hands, and in that instant the prince felt the horse  had taken a plunge into a gulf, and was sinking down and down, as a  stone cast from the summit of a cliff sinks down to the sea. At last the  horse struck the ground again, and the prince was"]]]
