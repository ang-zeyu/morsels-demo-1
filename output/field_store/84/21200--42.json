The first brigade reached its camping-ground to the north-west of  Kadesh; the tired troops pitched camp; the baggage was unloaded; and the  donkeys, released from their burdens, rolled on the ground in delight.  Just at that moment some of the Egyptian scouts came in, bringing with  them two Arabs whom they had caught, and suspected to belong to the  enemy. King Ramses ordered the Arabs to be soundly beaten with sticks,  and the poor creatures confessed that the Hittite King, with a great  army, was concealed on the other side of Kadesh, watching for an  opportunity to attack the Egyptian army. In great haste Ramses, scolding  his scouts the while for not keeping a better lookout, began to get his  soldiers under arms again, while Menna ran and yoked to the royal  chariot the two noble horses which had been kept fresh for the day of  battle.    But before Pharaoh could leap into his chariot a wild uproar broke out  at the gate of the camp, and the scattered fragments of the second  brigade came pouring in headlong flight into the enclosure. Behind them  the whole Hittite chariot force, 2,500 chariots strong, each chariot  with three men in it, came clattering and leaping upon the heels of the  fugitives. The Hittite King had waited till he saw the first brigade  busy pitching camp, and then, as the second came straggling up, he had  launched his chariots upon the flank of the weary soldiers, who were  swept away in a moment as if by a flood.    The rush of terrified men carried off the first brigade along with it in  hopeless rout. Ramses and Menna were left with only a few picked  chariots of the household troops, and the whole Hittite army was coming  on. But though King Ramses had made a terrible bungle of his  generalship, he was at least a brave man. Leaping into his chariot, and  calling to the handful of faithful soldiers to follow him, he bade Menna  lash his horses and charge the advancing Hittites. Menna was no coward,  but when he saw the thin line of Egyptian troops, and looked at the  dense mass of Hittite chariots, his heart almost failed him. He never  thought of disobedience, but, as he stooped over his plunging horses, he  panted to the King: \"O mighty strength of Egypt in the day of battle, we  are alone in the midst of the enemy. O, save us, Ramses, my good lord!\"  \"Steady, steady, my charioteer,\" said Ramses, \"I am going among them  like a hawk!\"    In a moment the fiery horses were whirling the King and his charioteer  between the files of the Hittite chariots, which drew aside as if  terrified at the glittering figures that dashed upon them so fearlessly.  As they swept through, Menna had enough to do to manage his steeds,  which were wild with excitement; but Ramses' bow was bent again and  again, and at every twang of the bowstring a Hittite champion fell from  his chariot. Behind the King came his household troops, and all together  they burst through the chariot brigade of the enemy, leaving a long  trail marked by dead and wounded men, overturned chariots, and maddened  horses.    Still King Ramses had only gained a breathing-space. The Hittites far  outnumbered his little force, and, though his orderlies were madly  galloping to bring up the third and fourth brigades, it must be some  time yet before even the nearest could come into action. Besides, on the  other bank of the river there hung a great cloud of 8,000 Hittite  spearmen, under the command of the Hittite King himself. If these got  time to cross the river, the Egyptian position, bad enough as it was,  would be hopeless. There was nothing for it but to charge again and  again, and, if possible, drive back the Hittite chariots on the river,  so as to hinder the spearmen from crossing.    So Menna whipped up his horses again, and, with arrow on string, the  Pharaoh dashed upon his enemies once more. Again they burst through the  opposing ranks, scattering death on either side as they passed. Now some  of the fragments of the first and second brigades were beginning to  rally and come back to the field, and the struggle was becoming less  unequal. The Egyptian quivers were nearly all empty now; but lance and  sword still remained, and inch by inch the Hittites were forced back  upon the river. Their King stood ingloriously on the opposite bank,  unable to do anything. It was too late for him to try to move his  spearmen across--they would only have been trampled down by the  retreating chariots. At last a great shout from the rear announced the  arrival of the third Egyptian brigade, and, the little knot of brave men  who had saved the day still leading, the army swept the broken Hittites  down the bank of the Orontes into the river.    Great was the confusion and the slaughter. As the chariots struggled  through the ford, the Egyptian bowmen, spread out along the bank, picked  off the chiefs. The two brothers of the Hittite King, the chief of his  bodyguard, his shield-bearer, and his chief scribe, were all killed. The  King of Aleppo missed the ford, and was swept down the river; but some  of his soldiers dashed into the water, rescued him, and, in rough first  aid, held the half-drowned leader up by the heels, to let the water  drain out of him. The Hittite King picked up his broken fugitives,  covered them with his mass of spearmen, and moved reluctantly off the  field where so splendid a chance of victory had been missed, and turned  into defeat. The Egyptians were too few and too weary to attempt to  cross the river in pursuit, and they retired to the camp of the first  brigade.    Then Pharaoh called his Captains before him. The troops stood around,  leaning on their spears, ashamed of their conduct in the earlier part of  the day, and wondering at the grim signs of conflict that lay on every  side. King Ramses called Menna to him, and, handing the reins to a  groom, the young charioteer came bowing before his master. Pharaoh  stripped from his own royal neck a collar of gold, and fastened it round  the neck of his faithful squire; and, while the Generals and Captains  hung their heads for shame, the King told them how shamefully they had  left him to fight his battle alone, and how none had stood by him but  the young charioteer. \"As for my two horses,\" he said, \"they shall be  fed before me every day in the royal palace.\"    [Illustration: PLATE 5.  ZAZAMANKH AND THE LOST CORONET.]    Both armies had suffered too much loss for any further strife to be  possible, and a truce was agreed upon. The Hittites drew off to the  north, and the Egyptians marched back again to Egypt, well aware that  they had gained little or nothing by all their efforts, but thankful  that they had been saved from the total destruction which had seemed so  near.    A proud man was Menna when he drove the royal chariot up to the bridge  of Zaru. As the troops passed the frontier canal the road was lined on  either side with crowds of nobles, priests, and scribes, strewing  flowers in the way, and bowing before the King. And after the Pharaoh  himself, whose bravery had saved the day, there was no one so honoured  as the young squire who had stood so manfully by his master in the hour  of danger.          CHAPTER VI    CHILD-LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT      How did the boys and girls live in this quaint old land so many hundreds  of years ago? How were they dressed, what sort of games did they play  at, what sort of lessons did they learn, and what kind of school did  they go to? If you could have lived in Egypt in those far-off days, you  would have found many differences between your life of to-day and the  life that the Egyptian children led; but you would also have found that  there were very many things much the same then as they are now. Boys and  girls were boys and girls three thousand years ago, just as they are  now; and you would find that they did very much the same things, and  even played very much the same games as you do to-day.    When you read in your fairy-stories about a little boy or girl, you  often hear that they had fairy godmothers who came to their cradles, and  gave them gifts, and foretold what was going to happen to the little  babies in after years. Well, when little Tahuti or little Sen-senb was  born in Thebes fifteen hundred years before Christ, there were fairy  godmothers too, who presided over the great event; and there were others  called the Hathors, who foretold all that was going to happen to the  little boy or girl as the years went on. The baby was kept a baby much  longer in those days than our little ones are kept. The happy mother  nursed the little thing carefully for three years at all events,  carrying it about with her wherever she went, either on her shoulder, or  astride upon her hip.    If baby took ill, and the doctor was called in, the medicines that were  given were not in the least like the sugar-coated pills and capsules  that make medicine-taking easy nowadays. The Egyptian doctor did not  know a very great deal about medicine and sickness, but he made up for  his ignorance by the nastiness of the doses which he gave to his  patients. I don't think you would like to take pills made up of the  moisture scraped from pig's ears, lizard's blood, bad meat, and decaying  fat, to say nothing of still nastier things. Often the doctor would look  very grave, and say, \"The child is not ill; he is bewitched\"; and then  he would sit down and write out a prescription something like this:  \"Remedy to drive away bewitchment. Take a great beetle; cut off his head  and his wings, boil him, put him in oil, and lay him out. Then cook  his head and his wings; put them in snake-fat, boil, and let the patient  drink the mixture.\" I think you would almost rather take the risk of  being bewitched than drink a dose like that!

Unc' Billy Possum, sticking his head out from a hollow tree,  held _his_ breath. Bobby Coon, looking through a hole in a hollow stump  in which he was hiding, held _his_ breath. Reddy Fox, lying flat down  behind a heap of brush, held _his_ breath. Peter Rabbit, sitting bolt  upright under a thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears wide open, held  _his_ breath. And all the other little people who happened to be where  they could see did the same thing.    You see, it was the most exciting moment ever was in the Green Forest.  Farmer Brown's boy had just stepped out from behind one side of a little  hemlock-tree and Buster Bear had just stepped out from behind the  opposite side of the little hemlock-tree and neither had known that the  other was anywhere near. For a whole minute they stood there face to  face, gazing into each other's eyes, while everybody watched and waited,  and it seemed as if the whole Green Forest was holding its breath.    Then something happened. Yes, Sir, something happened. Farmer Brown's  boy opened his mouth and yelled! It was such a sudden yell and such a  loud yell that it startled Chatterer so that he nearly fell from his  place in the tree, and it made Reddy Fox jump to his feet ready to run.  And that yell was a yell of fright. There was no doubt about it, for  with the yell Farmer Brown's boy turned and ran for home, as no one ever  had seen him run before. He ran just as Peter Rabbit runs when he has  got to reach the dear Old Briar-patch before Reddy Fox can catch him,  which, you know, is as fast as he can run. Once he stumbled and fell,  but he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling, and away he went without  once turning his head to see if Buster Bear was after him. There wasn't  any doubt that he was afraid, very much afraid.    Everybody leaned forward to watch him. \"What did I tell you? Didn't I  say that he was afraid of Buster Bear?\" cried Little Joe Otter, dancing  about with excitement.    \"You were right, Little Joe! I'm sorry that I doubted it. See him go!  Caw, caw, caw!\" shrieked Blacky the Crow.    For a minute or two everybody forgot about Buster Bear. Then there was a  great crash which made everybody turn to look the other way. What do you  think they saw? Why, Buster Bear was running away too, and he was  running twice as fast as Farmer Brown's boy! He bumped into trees and  crashed through bushes and jumped over logs, and in almost no time at  all he was out of sight. Altogether it was the most surprising thing  that the little people of the Green Forest ever had seen.    [Illustration: Buster Bear was running away, too. Page _71_.]    Sammy Jay looked at Blacky the Crow, and Blacky looked at Chatterer,  and Chatterer looked at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Peter  Rabbit, and Peter looked at Unc' Billy Possum, and Unc' Billy looked at  Bobby Coon, and Bobby looked at Johnny Chuck, and Johnny looked at Reddy  Fox, and Reddy looked at Jimmy Skunk, and Jimmy looked at Billy Mink,  and Billy looked at Little Joe Otter, and for a minute nobody could say  a word. Then Little Joe gave a funny little gasp.    \"Why, why-e-e!\" said he, \"I believe Buster Bear is afraid too!\" Unc'  Billy Possum chuckled. \"Ah believe yo' are right again, Brer Otter,\"  said he. \"It cert'nly does look so. If Brer Bear isn't scared, he must  have remembered something impo'tant and has gone to attend to it in a  powerful hurry.\"    Then everybody began to laugh.          XV    BUSTER BEAR IS A FALLEN HERO      A fallen hero is some one to whom every one has looked up as very brave  and then proves to be less brave than he was supposed to be. That was  the way with Buster Bear. When Little Joe Otter had told how Farmer  Brown's boy had been afraid at the mere sight of one of Buster Bear's  big footprints, they had at once made a hero of Buster. At least some of  them had. As this was the first time, the very first time, that they had  ever known any one who lives in the Green Forest to make Farmer Brown's  boy run away, they looked on Buster Bear with a great deal of respect  and were very proud of him.    But now they had seen Buster Bear and Farmer Brown's boy meet face to  face; and while it was true that Farmer Brown's boy had run away as fast  as ever he could, it was also true that Buster Bear had done the same  thing. He had run even faster than Farmer Brown's boy, and had hidden in  the most lonely place he could find in the very deepest part of the  Green Forest. It was hard to believe, but it was true. And right away  everybody lost a great deal of the respect for Buster which they had  felt. It is always that way. They began to say unkind things about him.  They said them among themselves, and some of them even said them to  Buster when they met him, or said them so that he would hear them.    Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, who, because they can fly,  have nothing to fear from Buster, and who always delight in making other  people uncomfortable, never let a chance go by to tell Buster and  everybody else within hearing what they thought of him. They delighted  in flying about through the Green Forest until they had found Buster  Bear and then from the safety of the tree tops screaming at him.      \"Buster Bear is big and strong;    His teeth are big; his claws are long;    In spite of these he runs away    And hides himself the livelong day!\"    A dozen times a day Buster would hear them screaming this. He would  grind his teeth and glare up at them, but that was all he could do. He  couldn't get at them. He just had to stand it and do nothing. But when  impudent little Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted the same thing from  a place just out of reach in a big pine-tree, Buster could stand it no  longer. He gave a deep, angry growl that made little shivers run over  Chatterer, and then suddenly he started up that tree after Chatterer.  With a frightened little shriek Chatterer scampered to the top of the  tree. He hadn't known that Buster could climb. But Buster is a splendid  climber, especially when the tree is big and stout as this one was, and  now he went up after Chatterer, growling angrily.    How Chatterer did wish that he had kept his tongue still! He ran to the  very top of the tree, so frightened that his teeth chattered, and when  he looked down and saw Buster's great mouth coming nearer and nearer, he  nearly tumbled down with terror. The worst of it was there wasn't  another tree near enough for him to jump to. He was in trouble this  time, was Chatterer, sure enough! And there was no one to help him.          XVI    CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL JUMPS FOR HIS LIFE      It isn't very often that Chatterer the Red Squirrel knows fear. That is  one reason that he is so often impudent and saucy. But once in a while a  great fear takes possession of him, as when he knows that Shadow the  Weasel is looking for him. You see, he knows that Shadow can go wherever  he can go. There are very few of the little people of the Green Forest  and the Green Meadows who do not know fear at some time or other, but it  comes to Chatterer as seldom as to any one, because he is very sure of  himself and his ability to hide or run away from danger.    But now as he clung to a little branch near the top of a tall pine-tree  in the Green Forest and looked down at the big sharp teeth of Buster  Bear drawing nearer and nearer, and listened to the deep, angry growls  that made his hair stand on end, Chatterer was too frightened to think.  If only he had kept his tongue still instead of saying hateful things to  Buster Bear! If only he had known that Buster could climb a tree! If  only he had chosen a tree near enough to other trees for him to jump  across! But he _had_ said hateful things, he _had_ chosen to sit in a  tree which stood quite by itself, and Buster Bear _could_ climb!  Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble, and there was no one to  blame but himself. That is usually the case with those who get into  trouble.    Nearer and nearer came Buster Bear, and deeper and angrier sounded his  voice. Chatterer gave a little frightened gasp and looked this way and  looked that way. What should he do? What _could_ he do! The ground  seemed a terrible distance below. If only he had wings like Sammy Jay!  But he hadn't.    \"Gr-r-r-r!\" growled Buster Bear. \"I'll teach you manners! I'll teach you  to treat your betters with respect! I'll swallow you whole, that's what  I'll do. Gr-r-r-r!\"    \"Oh!\" cried Chatterer.    \"Gr-r-r-r! I'll eat you all up to the last hair on your tail!\" growled  Buster, scrambling a little nearer.    \"Oh! Oh!\" cried Chatterer, and ran out to the very tip of the little  branch to which he had been clinging. Now if Chatterer had only known  it, Buster Bear couldn't reach him way up there, because the tree was  too small at the top for such a big fellow as Buster. But Chatterer  didn't think of that. He gave one more frightened look down at those big  teeth, then he shut his eyes and jumped--jumped straight out for the  far-away ground.    It was a long, long, long way down to the ground, and it certainly  looked as if such a little fellow as Chatterer must be killed. But  Chatterer had learned from Old Mother Nature that she had given him  certain things to help him at just such times, and one of them is the  power to spread himself very flat. He did it now. He spread his arms and  legs out just as far as he could, and that kept him from falling as fast  and as hard as he otherwise would have done, because being spread out so  flat that way, the air held him up a little. And then there was his  tail, that funny little tail he is so fond of jerking when he scolds.  This helped him too. It helped him keep his balance and keep from  turning over and over.    Down, down, down he sailed and landed on his feet. Of course, he hit the  ground pretty hard, and for just a second he quite lost his breath."]]]
