At fourteen, I went to  work in the railroad shops; at sixteen, I was firing a freight engine on  a railroad. I remember all the hardships, all the privations, of that  earlier day, and from that time until now, my heart has been with the  working class. I could have been in Congress long ago. I have preferred  to go to prison. The choice has been deliberately made. I could not have  done otherwise. I have no regret.    \"In the struggle--the unceasing struggle--between the toilers and  producers and their exploiters, I have tried, as best I might, to serve  those among whom I was born, with whom I expect to share my lot until  the end of my days.    \"I am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and factories; I am  thinking of the women who, for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out  their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of  their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the  remorseless grasp of mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons,  there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body  and soul. I can see them dwarfed, diseased, stunted, their little lives  broken, and their hopes blasted, because in this high noon of our  twentieth century civilization, money is still so much more important  than human life. Gold is god and rules in the affairs of men. The little  girls, and there are a million of them in this country--this, the most  favored land beneath the bending skies, a land in which we have vast  areas of rich and fertile soil, material resources in inexhaustible  abundance, the most marvelous productive machinery on earth, millions of  eager workers ready to apply their labor to that machinery to produce an  abundance for every man, woman and child--and if there are still many  millions of our people who are the victims of poverty, whose life is a  ceaseless struggle all the way from youth to age, until at last death  comes to their rescue and stills the aching heart, and lulls the victim  to dreamless sleep, it is not the fault of the Almighty, it can't be  charged to nature; it is due entirely to an outgrown social system that  ought to be abolished, not only in the interest of the working class,  but in a higher interest of all humanity.    \"I think of these little children--the girls that are in the textile  mills of all description in the East, in the cotton factories of the  South--I think of them at work in a vitiated atmosphere. I think of them  at work when they ought to be at play or at school; I think that when  they do grow up, if they live long enough to approach the marriage  state, they are unfit for it. Their nerves are worn out, their tissue is  exhausted, their vitality is spent. They have been fed to industry.  Their lives have been coined into gold. Their offspring are born tired.  That is why there are so many failures in our modern life.    \"Your Honor, the five per cent. of the people that I have made reference  to, constitute that element that absolutely rules our country. They  privately own all our public necessities. They wear no crowns; they  wield no sceptres, they sit upon no thrones; and yet they are our  economic masters and our political rulers. They control this Government  and all of its institutions. They control the courts.    \"The five per cent. of our people who own and control all of the sources  of wealth, all of the nation's industries, all of the means of our  common life--it is they who declare war; it is they who make peace; it  is they who control our industry. And so long as this is true, we can  make no just claim to being a democratic government--a self-governing  people.    \"I believe, your Honor, in common with all Socialists, that this nation  ought to own and control its industries. I believe, as all Socialists  do, that all things that are jointly needed and used ought to be jointly  owned--that industry, the basis of life, instead of being the private  property of the few and operated for their enrichment, ought to be the  common property of all, democratically administered in the interest of  all.    \"John D. Rockefeller has today an income of sixty million dollars a  year, five million dollars a month, two hundred thousand dollars a day.  He does not produce a penny of it. I make no attack upon Mr. Rockefeller  personally. I do not in the least dislike him. If he were in need, and  it were in my power to serve him, I should serve him as gladly as I  would any other human being, I have no quarrel with Mr. Rockefeller  personally, nor with any other capitalist. I am simply opposing a social  order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing  that is useful, to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars,  while millions of men and women who work all of the days of their lives  secure barely enough for existence.    \"This order of things cannot always endure. I have registered my protest  against it. I recognize the feebleness of my effort, but fortunately I  am not alone. There are multiplied thousands of others who, like myself,  have come to realize that before we may truly enjoy the blessings of  civilized life, we must reorganize society upon a mutual and  co-operative basis; and to this end we have organized a great economic  and political movement that is spread over the face of all the earth.    \"There are today upwards of sixty million Socialists, loyal, devoted,  adherents to this cause, regardless of nationality, race, creed, color  or sex. They are all making common cause. They are all spreading the  propaganda of the new social order. They are waiting, watching and  working through all the weary hours of the day and night. They are still  in the minority. They have learned how to be patient and abide their  time. They feel--they know indeed--that the time is coming in spite of  all opposition, all persecution, when this emancipating gospel will  spread among all the peoples, and when this minority will become the  triumphant majority and, sweeping into power, inaugurate the greatest  change in history.    \"In that day we will have the universal commonwealth--not the  destruction of the nation, but, on the contrary, the harmonious  co-operation of every nation on earth. In that day war will curse this  earth no more.    \"Your Honor, I ask no mercy. I plead for no immunity. I realize that  finally the right must prevail. I never more clearly comprehended than  now the great struggle between the powers of greed on the one hand and  upon the other the rising hosts of freedom.    \"I can see the dawn of a better day of humanity. The people are  awakening. In due course of time they will come to their own.    \"When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his  weary watch, he turns his eyes toward the southern cross, burning  luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches, the  southern cross begins to bend, and the whirling worlds change their  places, and with starry fingerpoints the Almighty marks the passage of  time upon the dial of the universe, and though no bell may beat the glad  tidings, the look-out knows that the midnight is passing--that relief  and rest are close at hand.    \"Let the people take heart and hope everywhere, for the cross is  bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning....    \"Your Honor, I thank you, and I thank all of this court for their  courtesy, for their kindness, which I shall remember always.    \"I am prepared to receive your sentence.\"    Whereupon the judge sentenced Eugene Debs to ten years in the West  Virginia Penitentiary--the penitentiary at Atlanta being too crowded to  receive him.      6. THE APPEAL    An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States and was  argued on the ground that the Espionage Act was unconstitutional. No act  was charged against Debs, except the Canton speech. In that speech he  had simply stated what he had said a thousand times before, but the  Court held that under the Espionage Act a man who made a speech, the  probable result of which was to create mutiny or to hinder recruiting  and enlistment--was guilty, providing that he did it knowingly and  wilfully. The jury had to decide, first, that he had done something the  probable result of which was to create mutiny or to hinder recruiting  and enlistment, and then if he had done it, that it was done with  intent, knowingly and wilfully. The jury had found Debs guilty under  these circumstances.    Debs was an American, and as an American he relied upon a certain  guarantee contained in the First Amendment to the Constitution:  \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or  prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of  speech or of the press, or the right of the people peacefully to  assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"  Debs, as an American citizen, relied upon that guarantee, and his  lawyers, in making the appeal, relied upon that guarantee.    Over and against that guarantee was the Espionage Act passed originally  in 1917--June 15th--and amended June 16, 1918.    The language of the original act was as follows:    (Title I, Sec. 3.) \"Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall (1)  wilfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to  interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces  of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies, and  whoever, when the United"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2069"],[0,"The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria (#6)"],[1,"gods Anu, Bel, and Ae. Stations for the great gods in the  likeness of constellations, together with what is regarded as the  Zodiac, were his next work. He then designated the year, setting three  constellations for each month, and made a station for  Nibiru--Merodach's own star--as the overseer of all the lights in the  firmament. He then caused the new moon, Nannaru, to shine, and made  him the ruler of the night, indicating his phases, one of which was on  the seventh day, and the other, a /sabattu/, or day of rest, in the  middle of the month. Directions with regard to the moon's movements  seem to follow, but the record is mutilated, and their real nature  consequently doubtful. With regard to other works which were performed  we have no information, as a gap prevents their being ascertained.  Something, however, seems to have been done with Merodach's  net--probably it was placed in the heavens as a constellation, as was his  bow, to which several names were given. Later on, the winds were bound  and assigned to their places, but the account of the arrangement of  other things is mutilated and obscure, though it can be recognised  that the details in this place were of considerable interest.                               The creation of man.    To all appearance the gods, after he had ordered the universe and the  things then existing, urged Merodach to further works of wonder.  Taking up their suggestion, he considered what he should do, and then  communicated to his father Ae his plan for the creation of man with  his own blood, in order that the service and worship of the gods might  be established. This portion is also unfortunately very imperfect, and  the details of the carrying out of the plan are entirely wanting.                        Berosus' narrative fills the gap.    It is noteworthy that this portion of the narrative has been preserved  by Abydenus, George the Syncellus, and Eusebius, in their quotations  from Berosus. According to this Chaldaean writer, there was a woman  named Omoroca, or, in Chaldaean, Thalatth (apparently a mistake for  Thauatth, i.e. Tiawath), whose name was equivalent to the Greek  Thalassa, the sea. It was she who had in her charge all the strange  creatures then existing. At this period, Belus (Bel-Merodach) came,  and cut the woman asunder, forming out of one half the earth, and of  the other the heavens, at the same time destroying all the creatures  which were within her--all this being an allegory, for the whole  universe consists of moisture, and creatures are constantly generated  therein. The deity then cut off his own head, and the other gods mixed  the blood, as it gushed out, with the earth, and from this men were  formed. Hence it is that men are rational, and partake of divine  knowledge.                                A second creation.    This Belsus, \"who is called Zeus,\" divided the darkness, separated the  heavens from the earth, and reduced the universe to order. The animals  which had been created, however, not being able to bear the light,  died. Belus then, seeing the void thus made, ordered one of the gods  to take off his head, and mix the blood with the soil, forming other  men and animals which should be able to bear the light. He also formed  the stars, the sun, the moon, and the five planets. It would thus seem  that there were two creations, the first having been a failure because  Belus had not foreseen that it was needful to produce beings which  should be able to bear the light. Whether this repetition was really  in the Babylonian legend, or whether Berosus (or those who quote him)  has merely inserted and united two varying accounts, will only be  known when the cuneiform text is completed.                              The concluding tablet.    The tablet of the fifty-one names completes the record of the tablets  found at Nineveh and Babylon. In this Merodach receives the titles of  all the other gods, thus identifying him with them, and leading to  that tendency to monotheism of which something will be said later on.  In this text, which is written, like the rest of the legend, in  poetical form, Merodach is repeatedly called /Tutu/, a mystic word  meaning \"creator,\" and \"begetter,\" from the reduplicate root /tu/ or  /utu/--which was to all appearances his name when it was desired to  refer to him especially in that character. Noteworthy in this portion  is the reference to Merodach's creation of mankind:--    Line 25. \"Tuto: Aga-azaga (the glorious crown)--may he make the crowns           glorious.       26. The lord of the glorious incantation bringing the dead to           life;       27. He who had mercy on the gods who had been overpowered;       28.

'The merciful one,' 'he with whom is salvation,'       31. May his word be established, and not forgotten,       32. In the mouth of the black-headed ones[1] whom his hands have           made.\"    [1] I.e. mankind.                                Man the redeemer.    The phrase \"to redeem them\" is, in the original, /ana padi-sunu/, the  verb being from /padu/, \"to spare,\" \"set free,\" and if this rendering  be correct, as seems probable, the Babylonian reasons for the creation  of mankind would be, that they might carry on the service and worship  of the gods, and by their righteousness redeem those enemies of the  gods who were undergoing punishment for their hostility. Whether by  this Tiawath, Apsu, Mummu, Kingu, and the monsters whom she had  created were included, or only the gods of heaven who had joined her,  the record does not say. Naturally, this doctrine depends entirely  upon the correctness of the translation of the words quoted. Jensen,  who first proposed this rendering, makes no attempt to explain it, and  simply asks: \"Does 'them' in 'to redeem(?) them' refer to the gods  named in line 28 or to mankind and then to a future--how  meant?--redemption? Eschatology? Zimmern's 'in their place' unprovable.  Delitzsch refrains from an explanation.\"           The bilingual account of the creation. Aruru aids Merodach.    Whilst dealing with this part of the religious beliefs of the  Babylonians, a few words are needed concerning the creation-story  which is prefixed to an incantation used in a purification ceremony.  The original text is Sumerian (dialectic), and is provided with a  Semitic translation. In this inscription, after stating that nothing  (in the beginning) existed, and even the great cities and temples of  Babylonia were as yet unbuilt, the condition of the world is briefly  indicated by the statement that \"All the lands were sea.\" The renowned  cities of Babylonia seem to have been regarded as being as much  creations of Merodach as the world and its inhabitants--indeed, it is  apparently for the glorification of those cities by attributing their  origin to Merodach, that the bilingual account of the creation was  composed.. \"When within the sea there was a stream\"--that is, when the  veins of Tiawath had been cut through--Eridu (probably = Paradise) and  the temple E-sagila within the Abyss were constructed, and after that  Babylon and the earthly temple of E-sagila within it. Then he made the  gods and the Annunnaki (the gods of the earth), proclaimed a glorious  city as the seat of the joy of their hearts, and afterwards made a  pleasant place in which the gods might dwell. The creation of mankind  followed, in which Merodach was aided by the goddess Aruru, who made  mankind's seed. Finally, plants, trees, and the animals, were  produced, after which Merodach constructed bricks, beams, houses, and  cities, including Niffer and Erech with their renowned temples.    We see here a change in the teaching with regard to Merodach--the gods  are no longer spoken of as \"his fathers,\" but he is the creator of the  gods, as well as of mankind.                  The order of the gods in the principal lists.    It is unfortunate that no lists of gods have been found in a  sufficiently complete state to allow of the scheme after which they  were drawn up to be determined without uncertainty. It may,  nevertheless, be regarded as probable that these lists, at least in  some cases, are arranged in conformity (to a certain extent) with the  appearance of the deities in the so-called creation-story. Some of  them begin with Anu, and give him various names, among them being  Ansar and Kisar, Lahmu and Lahame, etc. More specially interesting,  however, is a well-known trilingual list of gods, which contains the  names of the various deities in the following order:--                      EXTRACTS FROM THE TRILINGUAL LIST                                /Obverse/         Sumer.
