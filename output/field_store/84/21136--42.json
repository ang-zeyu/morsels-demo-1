[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#6)"],[1,"908), when the  Round Tower was probably built;[31] and in 908 it was transferred to  St. Andrews, which retained it until the Reformation. St. Adrian was  probably one of the three bishops of Alban[32] at Abernethy, as chapels  and crosses in the district are all connected with his name; and Cellach  appears as the first Bishop at St. Andrews, and he was succeeded by  eight Culdee bishops, the last of whom was Fothad, who officiated at the  marriage of Malcolm Canmore and Queen Margaret. The next three bishops  all died before consecration, and for about sixteen years after the  death of Malcolm the bishopric would appear to have been vacant. Turgot,  Queen Margaret's friend and confessor, was the thirteenth bishop, and  ruled from 1107-1115--the first bishop not of native birth.    Prior to 1107 the Culdee community had split up into two sections,  dividing the spiritualities and temporalities between them, and Bishop  Robert (1121-1159), with the object of superseding the Culdees, founded  in 1144 a priory for the regular monks of St. Augustine, granting to  them the Hospital of St. Andrews, with portions of the altarage. In the  same year King David granted a charter to the prior and canons of St.  Andrews, in which he provided that they shall receive the Keledei of  Kilrimont into the canonry, with all their possessions and revenues, if  they were willing to become canons-regular; but, if they refused, those  who are now alive are to retain the property during their lives, and,  after their death, as many canons-regular are to be instituted in the  church of St. Andrews as there are now Keledei, and all their  possessions are to be appropriated to the use of the canons. There were  thus two rival ecclesiastical bodies in St. Andrews--the old corporation  of secular priests and the new order of Austin-canons; the former  enjoyed the greater part of the old endowments, and the latter  recovered a considerable portion of the secularised property that had  passed into lay hands. Popes, bishops, and kings endeavoured to end this  rivalry, but their efforts were not crowned with success; although  influence was on the side of the canons-regular, the Keledei clung to  their prescriptive right to take part in the election of a bishop down  to 1273, when they were excluded by protest; in 1332 they were  absolutely excluded, and the formula of their exclusion from taking part  in the election was repeated;[33] we hear of them afterwards not as  Keledei, but as \"the provostry of the Church of St. Mary of the city of  St. Andrews,\" of \"the Church of the Blessed Mary of the Rock,\" and of  \"the provostry of Kirkheugh\"--the society consisting of a provost and  ten prebendaries.[34]    In the reign of Malcolm IV. the bishopric of St. Andrews included the  counties of Fife, Kinross, Clackmannan, the three Lothians,  Berwickshire, Roxburghshire, parts of Perthshire, Forfarshire, and  Kincardineshire; and, although the see was lessened by the creation of  new bishoprics, the importance of St. Andrews was always great, for at  the Reformation the primate's ecclesiastical jurisdiction included 2  archdeaconries, 9 rural deaneries, the patronage of 131 benefices, the  administration of 245 parishes. In 1471 or 1472 the see was erected into  an archbishopric by a bull of Pope Sixtus IV. and at this time the  Archbishop of York surrendered his claim to have the Bishop of St.  Andrews as his suffragan--a claim repeatedly made since the time of  Turgot and as frequently resented. The office of bishop or archbishop  involved great spiritual and temporal power; the primates were lords of  regality and ultimate heirs of all confiscated property within their  domains; they levied customs and at times had the power of coining  money; they presided at synods, controlled the appointment of abbots and  priors, were included with the King in the oath of allegiance, and took  precedence next to the royal family, and before all the Scottish  nobility. There were in all thirty-one bishops and six archbishops, who  held the see in succession from 908 to 1560, and among the more famous  of them may be mentioned Turgot, the friend and biographer of Queen  Margaret (1107-1115); Robert, prior of Scone, who founded the Priory of  St. Andrews, received the gift of the Culdee Monastery of Lochleven, and  built the church and tower of St. Rule (1124-1158); Arnold, Abbot of  Kelso, who started the building of the great cathedral (1158-1159);  William Wishart of Pitarrow, who was lord-chancellor and bishop  (1273-1279), and rebuilt, between 1272 and 1279, the west front, which  was blown down by a tempest of wind; William Lamberton (1298-1328), who  consecrated the cathedral in 1318, in the presence of King Robert the  Bruce; Henry Wardlaw (1404-1440), who founded in 1411 the University of  St. Andrews; James Kennedy (1440-1466)--the greatest of all the  bishops--who founded St. Salvador's College; James Stewart (1497-1503),  second son of James III., Duke of Ross and Marquis of Ormond, who was  made primate at twenty-one; Alexander Stewart (1506-1513), who was the  natural son of James IV., and fell with his father at Flodden; James  Beaton (1522-1539), who founded St. Mary's College and burnt Patrick  Hamilton; David Beaton, nephew of James Beaton (1539-1546), who burnt  Wishart and was murdered; John Hamilton (1549-1571), who was the author  of the Catechism of 1552.[35]    As to the buildings, St. Regulus' or St. Rule's, standing in the ancient  churchyard at a distance of about 120 feet south-east of the east end  of the Cathedral of St. Andrews, was unquestionably the earlier  Cathedral Church, and occupies probably the site of the earlier Celtic  church.    Bishop Robert (1121-1159) introduced the canons-regular of St. Augustine  in 1144, and these gradually absorbed many of the Culdees into their  community. It was during this time also that St. Rule's was built. Dr.  Joseph Robertson says of it:--\"The little Romanesque church and square  tower at St. Andrews, which bear the name of St. Rule, have, so far as  we know, no prototype in the south.... No one acquainted with the  progress of architecture will have much difficulty in identifying the  building with the small 'basilica' reared by Bishop Robert, an English  canon-regular of the order of St. Augustine, between the years 1127 and  1144.\"[36] The Pictish Chronicle states that Robert was elected Bishop  in the reign of Alexander I., but was not consecrated till the reign of  David I. in 1138; that, after his consecration by Thurstan, Archbishop  of York, he expended on this work one-seventh of the altar dues which  fell to him, reserving them for his own use. \"But inasmuch as the outlay  was small, the building made correspondingly small progress, until, by  the Divine favour, and the influence of the King, offerings flowed in,  and the work went on apace. The basilica was thus founded and in great  part constructed.\"[37]    What now remains of this building consists of a square tower, 112 feet  high, and an oblong chamber. Discussion has arisen as to whether there  ever was a nave, and in favour of the positive view it is urged that  marks of three successive roofs may be seen on the tower-wall, and that  the seals of the church, dated 1204 and 1214, show a nave and chancel.  Eminent authorities take this view. Sir Gilbert Scott thinks that the  large size of the western arch, and the mark of the roof on the tower,  suggest a nave;[38] while later authorities, recalling that this church  was once a cathedral, as well as the church of a monastery, and served  the purpose of a parish church, hold it as more than probable that it  must have been a larger building than the simple oblong chamber to the  east of the tower which now survives.[39]    The architecture corresponds with the period of Bishop Robert,[40] so  that there is more than probability in averring that St. Rule's was the  cathedral built by this bishop, and took the place of an earlier Celtic  church, founded by Bishop Acca. The square tower of St. Regulus was  probably designed to fulfil the same purposes as the Round Towers of  Abernethy and Brechin: (1) to serve as a belfry; (2) to be a keep or  place of strength in which the sacred utensils, books, relics, and other  valuables were deposited, and into which the ecclesiastics could retire  for security in case of sudden predatory attack; (3) when occasion  required, to be a beacon or watch-tower.[41]    Besides the Church of St. Regulus, there are still to be seen the ruins  of the great Cathedral of St. Andrews, which consisted of a short  aisleless presbytery, and choir of five bays with side aisles, with an  eastern chapel in each aisle; north and south transepts, each of three  bays with eastern aisles; nave of twelve bays with north and south  aisles, and a large central tower over the crossing. The interior  dimensions were--total length, 355 feet; width of nave, 63 feet; length  of transepts, 167 feet 6 inches; width, 43 feet 2 inches. The older  parts of the Cathedral exhibit traces of the transition from the Norman  architecture, but the principal parts of the structure have been carried  out in the First Pointed style.[42]    The Cathedral Church was also the Conventual Church of the  Austin-canons, and the Bishop was _ex officio_ prior of the monastery.  Of the conventual buildings erected by Bishop Robert nothing remains.    The Cathedral was erected from east to west in about 115 years.[43] The  work was commenced by Bishop Arnold in 1161, was continued by eleven  successive bishops, and was consecrated by Bishop Lamberton in 1318.  During its progress in 1276, the eastern end was greatly injured by a  violent tempest, and in 1378 the Cathedral suffered from fire, which  according to Wyntoun destroyed the south half of the nave from the west  end, and eastward to and including the ninth pillar. The restoration was  begun at once by Bishop Landel (1341-1385),"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#6)"],[1,"said--    \"Get up, Blindi, and come along with me.\"  Laying the head of the old  man gently on the ground, and rising with some wrath, Blindi demanded,  in English so broken that we find difficulty in mending it sufficiently  to be presented to the reader--    \"Wot for you means by dat?\"    \"Speak your mother tongue, you dog, and make haste, for the Minister of  Marine wants you.\"    \"Oh! mos' awfrul,\" exclaimed Blindi, turning pale, and drawing his blue  garment hastily round him, as he meekly followed the officer of  justice--whose chief office, by the way, was to administer injustice.    The man whom we have styled Blindi was a somewhat peculiar character.  He was an Algerine by birth, but had served several years in the British  navy, and had acquired a smattering of the English language--forecastle  English, as a matter of course.  In consequence of this, and of having  lost an eye in the service, he had obtained a pension, and the  appointment of interpreter to all his Britannic Majesty's ships visiting  Algiers.  He dwelt at the harbour, or Marina, where he excited the  wonder and admiration of all the Turks and Moors by his volubility in  talking English.  He was a man of no small importance, in his own  estimation, and was so proud of his powers as a linguist that he  invariably interlarded his converse with English phrases, whether he was  addressing Turk, Jew, or Christian.  Lingua Franca--a compound of nearly  all the languages spoken on the shores of the Mediterranean--was the  tongue most in use at the Marina of Algiers at that time, but as this  would be unintelligible to our reader, we will give Blindi's  conversations in his favourite language.  What his real name was we have  failed to discover.  The loss of his eye had obtained for him in the  navy the name of Blind Bob.  In his native city this was Italianised  into Blindi Bobi.  But Bobi was by no means blind of the other eye.  It  was like seven binocular glasses rolled into one telescope.  Once he had  unfortunately brought it to bear on the Minister of Marine with such a  concentrated stare that he, being also blind of an eye, regarded it as a  personal allusion thereto, and never forgave Blindi Bobi.    \"This is the second time,\" said Omar, when the culprit was brought  before him, \"that I have caught you interfering with the slaves.\"    \"Please, sar, hims was werry bad--dyin', me s'pose.\"    \"Speak your own tongue, dog, else you shall smart for it,\" said the  Minister of Marine, with increasing wrath.    The poor interpreter to his Britannic Majesty's navy repeated his words  in the Lingua Franca, but Omar, again interrupting him, ordered the  sbirro to take him off and give him the bastinado.    \"And have a care, Blindi,\" added Omar, observing that the interpreter  was about to speak; \"if you say that you are under the protection of the  British consul I'll have you flayed alive.--Off with him!\"    The sbirro, with a comrade, led Bobi through several of the narrow  streets of the town to a chamber which was set apart for the infliction  of punishment.  It was a dark, vaulted apartment under a public  building.  The massive pillars of stone which supported its roof looked  pale and ghostlike against the thick darkness which was beyond them,  giving the idea of interminable space.  One of the sbirros lighted a  lantern, and led the way through a massive door, all studded with huge  nails, into a small square chamber, the walls of which looked as if they  had been bespattered with a dark-brown liquid, especially in the  neighbourhood of several iron rings, from which chains depended.  In  addition to these and a number of other characteristic implements, there  was a pile of blood-stained rods in a corner.    Saying a few words to a powerful negro whom they found in attendance,  the sbirros handed Blindi Bobi over to him.  He instantly disrobed him  of his blue gown, and threw him on his back with the aid of an equally  powerful assistant, and began to uncover his stomach.    The interpreter was no coward.  He had prepared himself to endure  manfully the bastinado on the soles of his feet--as it was usually  administered--but when he perceived that they were about to inflict the  blows on a more tender part of his body, he trembled and remonstrated.    \"Sidi Omar no' say you hit 'im dare.  Hims 'peal to British consil--\"    Thus far he spoke, from the force of habit, in his adopted tongue, but  fear speedily drove him to that of his mother.    All tongues, however, were alike to the negroes, who, rendered callous  from long service against their will in a brutalising office, went about  their preparations with calm and slow indifference.    Just as they were about to begin, one of the sbirros, who had a personal  regard for Bobi, spoke a few words to one of the negroes, who  immediately turned Blindi Bobi on his face and firmly raised his feet so  that the naked soles were turned upwards.  The other negro applied one  of the rods thereto with all his might.  For a few seconds the poor  sufferer uttered no sound, but at last he gave vent to an irresistible  yell.  At a sign from the chief sbirro the punishment was stopped, and  Bobi was released and allowed to rise.    Conducting him to the door, the sbirro thrust him into the street, flung  his blue gown after him, and advised him to beware of again rousing the  wrath of Sidi Omar.    Blindi Bobi was far too well acquainted with the cruelties perpetrated  continually in the pirate city to be ignorant of the fact that he had  got off with a light punishment, yet we fear that did not cause him to  entertain much gratitude to Sidi Omar as he limped back to his quarters  at the Marina.    Arrived there, he observed that the sick old man still lay where he had  left him.  Running towards him with a sudden impulse, he drew forth his  flask, knelt down, raised the old man's head and gave him a long hearty  draught, after which he took another to himself.    \"Derre!\" he said, rising and shaking his fist defiantly in the direction  in which Sidi Omar dwelt, \"I's revenged on you--brute! bah! boo-o!\"    After this relief to his feelings Blindi Bobi went home to attend to his  poor feet.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Note 1.  In 1795 the Americans concluded peace with the Algerians by the  payment of half a million piastres, and an annual tribute of 24,000  piastres.        CHAPTER FIVE.    SHOWS THE LIGHT IN WHICH CONSULS WERE REGARDED BY PIRATES, AND TELLS OF  A CRUEL SEPARATION AND A STUNNING BLOW.    Seated on a throne in a recess of the audience-chamber of the palace,  Achmet Pasha at length condescended to receive Don Pedro, the  representative of Spain.    The Dey was robed in barbaric splendour, and absolutely shone with gold  embroidery and precious stones.  Centuries of robbery on the high seas  had filled the treasury of the pirates' nest to overflowing, not only  with hard cash, but with costly gems of all kinds, hence there was a  lavish expenditure of jewellery on the costumes of the Dey and his wives  and courtiers.    The recess in which he sat had a dome-ceiling, of workmanship so  elaborate that there was not a square inch of unadorned stucco on any  part of it.  It was lighted partly from the roof by means of four minute  windows, of yellow, crimson, green, and blue glass.  The walls were  decorated with coloured china tiles, and the floor was paved with white  marble.    In front of the throne or elevated dais couched the magnificent lion  which we have already mentioned.  It was the Dey's whim to use this  animal as a footstool on all public occasions, much to the annoyance of  his courtiers and household, who felt, although they did not dare to  express it, considerable anxiety lest it should take a sudden fancy to  feed on human flesh.    Behind the Dey stood several guards, two of whom were negroes.    Don Pedro bowed low on being admitted, and the lion, raising his head,  uttered a low growl, which had something distantly thunderous in the  tone.  Being apparently satisfied that the Don was a friend, it again  laid its chin on its paws and appeared to go to sleep.    The Spanish consul was a fine-looking, dignified man, with a nose  sufficiently prominent to account for the irreverent reference made to  it by Hadji Baba, the story-teller.    In a few words he stated his case touching the female captives recently  brought in by Sidi Hassan, and claimed that, as Spanish subjects, they  should be set free and placed under his care.    \"What proof can you give,\" demanded the Dey, \"that these ladies are  really the subjects of Spain?\"    \"Alas!\" replied Don Pedro, \"I have no means of verifying what I say; but  I feel assured that your highness will not doubt my word, when I say  that, while in my own land, I knew the family to which they belong.\"    \"That is not sufficient,\" returned the Dey.  \"From all that I can learn,  their father lived and died and they were born, in Sicily, and the  eldest is the wife of an Italian merchant, who will doubtless be glad to  pay a good ransom to get her and his little infant back.  As to the  sister, we can find room for her in the palace, if she be not ransomed.  Besides, Monsieur le Console,\"--here the Dey spoke sternly--\"your word  is not a good guarantee.  Did you not give me your word three months ago  that your government would pay the six thousand dollars which are still  due to us?  Why has not this promise been fulfilled?\"    \"It grieves me, your highness,\" replied Don Pedro, with a mortified  look, \"that this debt has not yet been discharged, but I can assure you  that I have communicated with my Sovereign on the subject and have no  doubt that a satisfactory explanation and reply will be sent to you  without delay.\"    \"It is to be hoped that such may be the case, for I give you _my_ word--  and you may safely rely on _it_--that if the cash is not sent to me  immediately I will "]]]
