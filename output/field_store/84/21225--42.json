[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23625"],[0,"The Magic Pudding (#6)"],[1,"in  Sam's youth, which I will now sing you. The incident, though similar as  regards courage an' darin', is totally different in regard to everythin'  else, and is entitled--    [Illustration]    THE PENGUIN'S BRIDE      ''Twas on the _Saucy Soup Tureen_,      That Sam was foremast hand,    When on the quarter-deck was seen    A maiding fit to be a Queen      With her old Uncle stand.      'And Sam at once was sunk all      In passion deep and grand,    But this here aged Uncle    He was the Hearl of Buncle      And Sam a foremast hand.      'And Sam he chewed salt junk all      Day with grief forlorn,    Because the Hearl of Buncle,      The lovely maiding's Uncle,    Regarded him with scorn.      'When sailin' by Barbado,      The _Saucy Soup Tureen_,    Before she could be stayed-O    Went down in a tornado,      And never more was seen.    [Illustration]      'The passengers were sunk all      Beneath the ragin' wave,    The maiding and her Uncle,    The Noble Hearl of Buncle,      Were saved by Sam the Brave.    [Illustration]      'He saved the Noble Buncle      By divin' off the poop.    The maiding in a funk all    He, saved along with Uncle      Upon a chicken coop.      'And this here niece of Buncle,      When they got safe to land,    For havin' saved her Uncle,    The Noble Hearl of Buncle,      She offered Sam her hand.      'And that old Uncle Buncle,      For joy of his release,    On Burgundy got drunk all    Day in Castle Buncle,      Which hastened his decease.      'The lovely maiding Buncle      Inherited the land;    And, now her aged Uncle    Has gone, the Hearl of Buncle      Is Sam, the foremast hand.'    [Illustration]    'Of course,' said Sam modestly, 'the song goes too far in sayin' as how  I married the Hearl's niece, because, for one thing, I ain't a marryin'  man, and for another thing, what she really sez to me when we got to  land was, \"You're a noble feller, an' here's five shillin's for you, and  any time you happen to be round our way, just give a ring at the  servants' bell, and there'll always be a feed waitin' for you in the  kitchen.\" However, you've got to have songs to fill in the time with,  and when a feller's got a rotten word like Buncle to find rhymes for,  there's no sayin' how a song'll end.'    'The exigencies of rhyme,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'may stand excused from  a too strict insistence on verisimilitude, so that the general gaiety is  thereby promoted. And now,' he added, 'before retiring to rest, let us  all join in song,' and grasping each other's hands they loudly sang--    THE PUDDIN'-OWNERS' EVENSONG      'Let feeble feeders stoop    To plates of oyster soup.      Let pap engage      The gums of age    And appetites that droop;      We much prefer to chew      A Steak-and-kidney stew.      'Let yokels coarse appease    Their appetites with cheese.      Let women dream      Of cakes and cream,    We scorn fal-lals like these;      Our sterner sex extols      The joy of boiled jam rolls.      'We scorn digestive pills;    Give us the food that fills;      Who bravely stuff      Themselves with Duff,    May laugh at Doctor's bills.      For medicine, partake      Of kidney, stewed with steak.      'Then plight our faith anew    Three puddin'-owners true,      Who boldly claim      In Friendship's name    The noble Irish stoo,    Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurroo!'          Third Slice      [Illustration]    'After our experience of yesterday,' said Bill Barnacle as the company  of Puddin'-owners set off along the road with their Puddin', 'we shall  have to be particularly careful. For what with low puddin'-thieves  disguising themselves as firemen, and low Wombats sneakin' our Puddin'  while we're helpin' to put out fires, not to speak of all the worry and  bother of tryin' to get information out of parrots and bandicoots an'  hedgehogs, why, it's enough to make a man suspect his own grandfather of  bein' a puddin'-snatcher.'    'As for me,' said Sam Sawnoff, practising boxing attitudes as he walked  along, 'I feel like laying out the first man we meet on the off-chance  of his being a puddin'-thief.'    'Indeed,' observed Bunyip Bluegum, 'to have one's noblest feelings  outraged by reposing a too great trust in unworthy people, is to end by  regarding all humanity with an equal suspicion.'    'If you ask my opinion,' said the Puddin' cynically, 'them  puddin'-thieves are too clever for you; and, what's more, they're better  eaters than you. Why,' said the Puddin', sneering at Bill, 'I'll back  one puddin'-thief to eat more in a given time than three Puddin'-owners  put together.'    'These are very treacherous sentiments, Albert,' said Bill sternly.  'These are very ignoble and shameless words,' but the Puddin' merely  laughed scornfully, and called Bill a bun-headed old beetle-crusher.    'Very well,' said Bill, enraged, 'we shall see if a low puddin'-thief is  better than a noble Puddin'-owner. When you see the terrible suspicions  I shall indulge in to-day you'll regret them words.'    To prove his words Bill insisted on closely inspecting everybody he met,  in case they should be puddin'-thieves in disguise.    To start off with, they had an unpleasant scene with a Kookaburra, a low  larrikin who resented the way that Bill examined him.    'Who are you starin' at, Poodle's Whiskers?' he asked.    [Illustration]    'Never mind,' said Bill. 'I'm starin' at you for a good an' sufficient  reason.'    'Are yer?' said the Kookaburra. 'Well, all I can say is that if yer  don't take yer dial outer the road I'll bloomin' well take an' bounce a  gibber off yer crust,' and he followed them for quite a long way,  singing out insulting things such as, 'You with the wire whiskers,' and  'Get onter the bloke with the face fringe.'    Bill, of course, treated this conduct with silent contempt. It was his  rule through life, he said, never to fight people with beaks.    The next encounter they had was with a Flying-fox who, though not so  vulgar and rude as the Kookaburra, was equally enraged because, as Bill  had suspicions that he was the Possum disguised, he insisted on  measuring him to see if he was the same length.    'Nice goings on, indeed,' said the Flying-fox, while Bill was measuring  him, 'if a man can't go about his business without being measured by  total strangers. A nice thing, indeed, to happen to Finglebury  Flying-fox, the well-known and respected fruit stealer.'    However, he was found to be six inches too short, so they let him go,  and he hurried off, saying, 'I shall have the Law on you for this,  measuring a man in a public place without being licensed as a tailor.'    [Illustration]    The third disturbance due to Bill's suspicions occurred while Bunyip  Bluegum was in a grocer's shop. They had run out of tea and sugar, and  happening to pass through the town of Bungledoo took the opportunity of  laying in a fresh supply. If Bunyip hadn't been in the shop, as was  pointed out afterwards, the trouble wouldn't have occurred. The first he  heard of it was a scream of 'Help, help, murder is being done!' and  rushing out of the shop, what was his amazement to see no less a person  than his Uncle Wattleberry bounding and plunging about the road with  Bill hanging on to his whiskers, and Sam hanging on to one leg.    [Illustration]    'I've got him,' shouted Bill. 'Catch a hold of his other leg and give me  a chance to get his whiskers off.'    'But why are you taking his whiskers off?' inquired Bunyip Bluegum.    [Illustration]    'Because they're stuck on with glue,' shouted Bill. 'I saw it at a  glance. It's Watkin Wombat, Esq., disguised as a company promoter.'    'Dear me,' said Bunyip, hurriedly, 'you are making a mistake. This is  not a puddin'-thief, this is an Uncle.'    'A what?' exclaimed Bill, letting go the whiskers.    'An Uncle,' replied Bunyip Bluegum.    'An Uncle,' roared Uncle Wattleberry. 'An Uncle of the highest  integrity. You have most disgracefully and unmercifully pulled an  Uncle's whiskers.'    'I can assure you,' said Bill, 'I pulled them under the delusion that  you was a disguised Wombat.'    'That is no excuse, sir,' bellowed Uncle Wattleberry. 'No one but an  unmitigated ruffian would pull an Uncle's whiskers.      'Who but the basest scoundrel, double-eyed,    Would pluck an Uncle's whiskers in their pride,    What baseness, then, doth such a man disclose    Who'd raise a hand to pluck an Uncle's nose?'    'If I've gone too far,' said Bill, 'I apologize. If I'd known you was an  Uncle I wouldn't have done it.'    'Apologies are totally inadequate,' shouted Uncle Wattleberry. 'Nothing  short of felling you to the earth with an umbrella could possibly atone  for the outrage. You are a danger to the whisker-growing public. You  have knocked my hat off, pulled my whiskers, and tried to remove my  nose.'    'Pullin' your nose,' said Bill, solemnly, 'is a mistake any man might  make, for I put it to all present, as man to man, if that nose don't  look as if it's only gummed on.'    All present were forced to admit that it was a mistake that any man  might make. 'Any man,' as Sam remarked, 'would think he was doing you a  kindness by trying to pull it off.'    'Allow me to point out also, my dear Uncle,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'that  your whiskers were responsible for this seeming outrage. Let your anger,  then, be assuaged by the consciousness that you are the victim, not of  malice, but of the misfortune of wearing whiskers.'    'How now,' exclaimed Uncle Wattleberry. 'My nephew Bunyip among these  sacrilegious whisker-pluckers and nose-pullers. My nephew, not only  aiding and abetting these ruffians, but seeking to palliate their  crimes! This is too much. My feelings are such that nothing but bounding  and plunging can relieve them.'    And thereupon did Uncle Wattleberry proceed to bound and plunge with the  greatest activity, shouting all the while--      'You need not think I bound and plunge      Like this in festive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#6)"],[1,"air, it  will become altered in its direction by refraction or reflection, and  polarised, each side or pole having different properties.    Polarised light cannot be made again to pass in a certain direction  through the crystal which has polarised it; nor can it again be  reflected at a particular angle; so that in double-refracting crystals,  these two poles, or polarised beams, are different in colour, some  stones being opaque to one beam but not to the other, whilst some are  opaque to both.    This curious phenomenon, with this brief, though somewhat technical  explanation, shows the cause of many of the great charms in precious  stones, for when viewed at one angle they appear of a definite colour,  whilst at another angle they are just as decided in their colour, which  is then entirely different; and as these angles change as the eye  glances on various facets, the stone assumes a marvellous wealth of the  most brilliant and intense colour of kaleidoscopic variety, even in a  stone which may itself be absolutely clear or colourless to ordinary  light.    Such an effect is called pleochroism, and crystals which show variations  in their colour when viewed from different angles, or by transmitted  light, are called pleochroic, or pleochromatic--from two Greek words  signifying \"to colour more.\" To aid in the examination of this  wonderfully beautiful property possessed by precious stones, a little  instrument has been invented called the dichroscope, its name showing  its Greek derivation, and meaning--\"to see colour twice\" (twice, colour,  to see). It is often a part of a polariscope; frequently a part also of  the polarising attachment to the microscope, and is so simple and  ingenious as to deserve detailed explanation.    In a small, brass tube is fixed a double-image prism of calcite or  Iceland spar, which has been achromatised--that is, clear, devoid of  colour--and is therefore capable of transmitting light without showing  any prismatic effect, or allowing the least trace of any except the  clear light-beam to pass through. At one end of this tube there is a  tiny square hole, the opposite end carrying a small convex lens, of such  a strength or focus as to show the square hole in true focus, that is,  with perfectly sharp definition, even up to the corners of the square.  On looking through the tube, the square hole is duplicated, two squares  being seen. The colours of a gem are tested by the stone being put in  front of this square, when the two colours are seen quite distinctly.  Not only is this a simple means of judging colour, but it enables a  stone to be classified readily. For if the dichroscope shows two images  of _the same_ colour, then it may possibly be a carbuncle, or a diamond,  as the case may be--for single-refracting stones, of the first or cubic  system, show two images of _the same_ colour. But if these two colours  are different, then it must be a double-refracting stone, and according  to the particular colours seen, so is the stone classified, for each  stone has its own identical colour or colours when viewed through this  small but useful instrument.    How clear and distinct are these changes may be viewed without it in  substances strongly dichroic; for instance, if common mica is viewed in  one direction, it is transparent as polished plate-glass, whilst at  another angle, it is totally opaque. Chloride of palladium also is  blood-red when viewed parallel to its axis, and transversely, it is a  remarkably bright green. The beryl also, is sea-green one way and a  beautiful blue another; the yellow chrysoberyl is brown one way and  yellow with a greenish cast when viewed another way. The pink topaz  shows rose-colour in one direction and yellow in another. These are  perhaps the most striking examples, and are mostly self-evident to the  naked eye, whilst in other cases, the changes are so delicate that the  instrument must be used to give certainty; some again show changes of  colour as the stone is revolved in the dichroscope, or the instrument  revolved round the stone.    Some stones, such as the opal, split up the light-beams as does a  prism, and show a wonderful exhibition of prismatic colour, which is  technically known as a \"play of colour.\" The descriptive term  \"opalescence\" is self-suggesting as to its origin, which is the \"noble\"  or \"precious\" opal; this radiates brilliant and rapidly changing  iridescent reflections of blue, green, yellow and red, all blending  with, and coming out of, a curious silky and milky whiteness, which is  altogether characteristic. The moonstone is another example of this  peculiar feature which is possessed in a more or less degree by all the  stones in the class of pellucid jewels, but no stone or gem can in any  way even rival the curious mixture of opaqueness, translucency,  silkiness, milkiness, fire, and the steadfast changeable and prismatic  brilliance of colour of the precious opal. The other six varieties of  opal are much inferior in their strange mixture of these anomalies of  light and colour. Given in order of value, we have as the second, the  \"fire\" opal with a red reflection, and, as a rule, that only. The third  in value is the \"common\" opal, with the colours of green, red, white and  yellow, but this is easily distinguishable from the \"noble\" or  \"precious\" variety in that the common opal does not possess that  wonderful \"play\" of colour. The fourth variety is called the  \"semi-opal,\" which is really like the third variety, the \"common,\" but  of a poorer quality and more opaque. The fifth variety in order of  value, is that known as the \"hydrophane,\" which has an interesting  characteristic in becoming transparent when immersed in water, and only  then. The sixth is the \"hyalite,\" which has but a glassy or vitreous  lustre, and is found almost exclusively in the form of globules, or  clusters of globules, somewhat after the form and size of bunches of  grapes; hence the name \"botryoidal\" is often applied to this variety.  The last and commonest of all the seven varieties of opal is somewhat  after the shape of a kidney (reniform), or other irregular shape,  occasionally almost transparent, but more often somewhat translucent,  and very often opaque. This seventh class is called \"menilite,\" being  really an opaline form of quartz, originally found at Menilmontant,  hence its name (_Menil_, and Greek _lithos_, stone). It is a curious  blue on the exterior of the stone, brown inside.    History records many magnificent and valuable opals, not the least of  which was that of Nonius, who declined to give it to Mark Antony,  choosing exile rather than part with so rare a jewel, which Pliny  describes as being existent in his day, and of a value which, in present  English computation, would exceed one hundred thousand pounds.    Many other stones possess one or more properties of the opal, and are  therefore considered more or less opalescent. This \"play of colour\" and  \"opalescence,\" must not be confused with \"change of colour.\" The two  first appear mostly in spots and in brilliant points or flashes of  coloured light, or \"fire\" as it is termed. This fire is constantly on  the move, or \"playing,\" whereas \"change of colour,\" though not greatly  dissimilar, is when the fire merely travels over broader surfaces, each  colour remaining constant, such as when directly moving the stone, or  turning it, when the broad mass of coloured light slowly changes,  usually to its complementary. Thus in this class of stone, subject to  \"change of colour,\" a green light is usually followed by its  complementary, red, yellow by purple, blue by orange, green by brown,  orange by grey, purple by broken green, with all the intermediary shades  of each.    Thus when the line of sight is altered, or the stone moved, never  otherwise, the colours chase one another over the surface of the gem,  and mostly in broad splashes; but in those gems possessing \"play of  colour,\" strictly speaking, whilst the stone itself remains perfectly  still, and the sight is fixed unwaveringly upon it, the pulsations of  the blood in the eyes, with the natural movements of the eyes and  eyelids, even in a fixed, steady glance, are quite sufficient to create  in the stone a display of sparks and splashes of beautiful fiery light  and colour at every tremor.    The term \"iridescence\" is used when the display of colour is seen on the  surface, rather than coming out of the stone itself. The cause of this  is a natural, or in some cases an accidental, breaking of the surface of  the stone into numerous cobweb-like cracks; these are often of  microscopic fineness, only perceptible under moderately high powers.  Nevertheless they are quite sufficient to interfere with and refract the  light rays and to split them up prismatically. In some inferior stones  this same effect is caused or obtained by the application of a gentle  heat, immersion in chemicals, subjection to \"X rays\" and other strong  electric influence, and in many other ways. As a result, the stone is  very slightly expanded, and as the molecules separate, there appear on  the surface thousands, perhaps millions, of microscopic fissures running  at all angles, so that no matter from what position the stone may be  viewed, a great number of these fissures are certain to split up the  light into prismatic colours causing brilliant iridescence. Similar  fissures may often be seen with the naked eye on glass, especially if  scorched or cooled too rapidly (chilled), and on the surface of clear  spar and mica, their effects being of extreme interest, from a colour  point of view, at least.          CHAPTER VII.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      E--HARDNESS.    Hardness is perhaps one of the most important features in a stone,  especially those of the \"gem\" series, for no matter how colour, lustre,  general beauty and even rarity may entitle a stone to the designation  \"precious,\" unless it possesses great"]]]
