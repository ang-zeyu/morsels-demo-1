Ampere, in his Voyage en Egypte et en Nubie, p.       120, says,--\"May it not be that this name, denoting the place       where the most fertile part of Egypt begins, is a       reminiscence of the Cow Goddess, of Isis, the symbol of       fecundity, and the personification of Egypt?\"         **De Roziere estimated the mean breadth as being only a       little over nine miles.    During the earlier ages, the river filled all this intermediate space,  and the sides of the hills, polished, worn, blackened to their very  summits, still bear unmistakable traces of its action. Wasted, and  shrunken within the deeps of its ancient bed, the stream now makes a way  through its own thick deposits of mud. The bulk of its waters keeps  to the east, and constitutes the true Nile, the \"Great River\" of the  hieroglyphic inscriptions. A second arm flows close to the Libyan  desert, here and there formed into canals, elsewhere left to follow  its own course. From the head of the Delta to the village of Demt it  is called the Bahr-Yusuf; beyond Derut--up to Gebel Silsileh--it is the  Ibrahimiyeh, the Sohagiyeh, the Raian. But the ancient names are unknown  to us. This Western Nile dries up in winter throughout all its upper  courses: where it continues to flow, it is by scanty accessions from  the main Nile. It also divides north of Henassieh, and by the gorge of  Illahun sends out a branch which passes beyond the hills into the basin  of the Fayurn. The true Nile, the Eastern Nile, is less a river than  a sinuous lake encumbered with islets and sandbanks, and its navigable  channel winds capriciously between them, flowing with a strong and  steady current below the steep, black banks cut sheer through the  alluvial earth.    [Illustration: 009.jpg A LINE OF LADEN CAMELS EMERGES FROM A HOLLOW OF  THE UNDULATING ROAD. 1]         1  From a drawing by Boudier, after a photograph by       Insinger, taken in 1884.    There are light groves of the date-palm, groups of acacia trees and  sycamores, square patches of barley or of wheat, fields of beans or of  bersim,[*] and here and there a long bank of sand which the least breeze  raises into whirling clouds. And over all there broods a great silence,  scarcely broken by the cry of birds, or the song of rowers in a passing  boat.         * Bersim is a kind of trefoil, the _Trifolium Alexandrinum_       of LINNAEUS. It is very common in Egypt, and the only plant       of the kind generally cultivated for fodder.    Something of human life may stir on the banks, but it is softened into  poetry by distance. A half-veiled woman, bearing a bundle of herbs upon  her head, is driving her goats before her. An irregular line of asses or  of laden camels emerges from one hollow of the undulating road only to  disappear within another. A group of peasants, crouched upon the shore,  in the ancient posture of knees to chin, patiently awaits the return of  the ferry-boat.    [Illustration: 010.jpg]         1  From a drawing by Boudier, after a photograph by       Insinger, taken in 1886.    A dainty village looks forth smiling from beneath its palm trees. Near  at hand it is all naked filth and ugliness: a cluster of low grey huts  built of mud and laths; two or three taller houses, whitewashed;  an enclosed square shaded by sycamores; a few old men, each seated  peacefully at his own door; a confusion of fowls, children, goats, and  sheep; half a dozen boats made fast ashore. But, as we pass on, the  wretchedness all fades away; meanness of detail is lost in light, and  long before it disappears at a bend of the river, the village is again  clothed with gaiety and serene beauty. Day by day, the landscape repeats  itself. The same groups of trees alternate with the same fields, growing  green or dusty in the sunlight according to the season of the year. With  the same measured flow, the Nile winds beneath its steep banks and about  its scattered islands.    [Illustration: 011.jpg PART OF GEBEL SHEKH HERIDI. 1]         1 From a drawing by Boudier, after a photograph by Insinger,       taken in 1882.    One village succeeds another, each alike smiling and sordid under its  crown of foliage. The terraces of the Libyan hills, away beyond the  Western Nile, scarcely rise above the horizon, and lie like a white  edging between the green of the plain and the blue of the sky. The  Arabian hills do not form one unbroken line, but a series of mountain  masses with their spurs, now approaching the river, and now withdrawing  to the desert at almost regular intervals. At the entrance to the  valley, rise Gebel Mokattam and Gebel el-Ahmar. Gebel Hemur-Shemul and  Gebel Shekh Embarak next stretch in echelon from north to south, and are  succeeded by Gebel et-Ter, where, according to an old legend, all the  birds of the world are annually assembled.[*]         * In Makrizi's _Description of Egypt_ we read: \"Every year,       upon a certain day, all the herons (Boukir, _Ardea bubulcus_       of Cuvier) assemble at this mountain. One after another,       each puts his beak into a cleft of the hill until the cleft       closes upon one of them. And then forthwith all the others       fly away But the bird which has been caught struggles until       he dies, and there his body remains until it has fallen into       dust.\" The same tale is told by other Arab writers, of which       a list may be seen in Etienne Quatremere, _Memoires       historiques et geographiques sur l'Egypte et quelques       contrees voisines_, vol. i. pp. 31-33. It faintly recalls       that ancient tradition of the Cleft at Abydos, whereby souls       must pass, as human-headed birds, in order to reach the       other world.    [Illustration: 12.jpg THE HILL OF KASR ES-SAYYAD. 2]         2  From a drawing by Boudier, after a photograph by       insinger, taken in 1882.    Then follows Gebel Abufeda, dreaded by the sailors for its sudden gusts.  Limestone predominates throughout, white or yellowish, broken by veins  of alabaster, or of red and grey sandstones. Its horizontal strata are  so symmetrically laid one above another as to seem more like the walls  of a town than the side of a mountain. But time has often dismantled  their summits and loosened their foundations. Man has broken into their  facades to cut his quarries and his tombs; while the current is secretly  undermining the base, wherein it has made many a breach. As soon as any  margin of mud has collected between cliffs and river, halfah and wild  plants take hold upon it, and date-palms grow there--whence their seed,  no one knows. Presently a hamlet rises at the mouth of the ravine,  among clusters of trees and fields in miniature. Beyond Siut, the light  becomes more glowing, the air drier and more vibrating, and the green of  cultivation loses its brightness. The angular outline of the dom-palni  mingles more and more with that of the common palm and of the heavy  sycamore, and the castor-oil plant increasingly abounds. But all these  changes come about so gradually that they are effected before we notice  them. The plain continues to contract. At Thebes it is still ten miles  wide; at the gorge of Gebelen it has almost disappeared, and at Gebel  Silsileh it has completely vanished. There, it was crossed by a natural  dyke of sandstone, through which the waters have with difficulty scooped  for themselves a passage. From this point, Egypt is nothing but the bed  of the Nile lying between two escarpments of naked rock.    Further on the cultivable land reappears, but narrowed, and changed  almost beyond recognition. Hills, hewn out of solid sandstone, succeed  each other at distances of about two miles, low, crushed, sombre, and  formless. Presently a forest of palm trees, the last on that side,  announces Aswan and Nubia. Five banks of granite, ranged in lines  between latitude 24 deg. and 18 deg. N., cross Nubia from east to west, and from  north-east to south-west, like so many ramparts thrown up between the  Mediterranean and the heart of Africa. The Nile has attacked them from  behind, and made its way over them one after another in rapids which  have been glorified by the name of cataracts.    [Illustration: 014.jpg ENTRANCE TO THE FIRST CATARACT. 1]         1 View taken from the hills opposite Elephantine, by       Insinger, in 1884.    Classic writers were pleased to describe the river as hurled into the  gulfs of Syne with so great a roar that the people of the neighbourhood  were deafened by it. Even a colony of Persians, sent thither by  Cambyses, could not bear the noise of the falls, and went forth to seek  a quieter situation. The first cataract is a kind of sloping and sinuous  passage six and a quarter miles in length, descending from the island  of Philae to the port of Aswan, the aspect of its approach relieved and  brightened by the ever green groves of Elephantine. Beyond Elephantine  are cliffs and sandy beaches, chains of blackened \"roches moutonnees\"  marking out the beds of the currents, and fantastic reefs, sometimes  bare and sometimes veiled by long grasses and climbing plants, in  which thousands of birds have made their nests. There are islets  too, occasionally large enough to have once supported something of a  population, such as Amerade, Salug, Sehel. The granite threshold of  Nubia, is broken beyond Sehel, but its debris, massed m disorder against  the right bank, still seem to dispute the passage of the waters, dashing  turbulently and roaring as they flow along through tortuous channels,  where every streamlet is broken up into small cascades, ihe channel  running by the left bank is always navigable.    [Illustration: 015.jpg ENTRANCE TO NUBIA.]    During the inundation, the rocks and sandbanks of the right side are  completely under water, and their presence is only betrayed by eddies.  But on the river's reaching its lowest point a fall of some six feet is  established, and there big boats, hugging the shore, are hauled up by  means"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19406"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXXVI., No. 8, February 24, 1877 (#6)"],[1,"that the drum was not holding, and that the speed was  accelerating rapidly. Brakes and steam were both found useless, and  the engine went tearing over the rails at the rate of a mile a minute.  Of the fourteen persons in the vehicles, three were thrown out and  killed, and the rest were more or less seriously injured. The heavily  loaded car left the track, and tore up both central and side rails  until its coupling broke. The engineer, with great intrepidity, clung  to his engine, coolly giving signals to open switches so that the  locomotive might run upon the level track and so expend its momentum;  but the engine left the rails at a sharp curve, destroyed the track  for about a hundred feet, and finally stopped a mass of ruins, with  its brave engineer mortally wounded. Whether the Wetli system can be  made to work as intended by the inventor is regarded as doubtful by  the engineers who have examined into the causes of the disaster.           *       *       *       *       *      LEGHORN HENS.    If a man keeps Leghorns he must have no garden, or he must cover the  top of his hen yards. That Leghorns are great layers and active hens,  there can be no denying, but they are great flyers. We have built our  yard a lath and a half high, says the _Poultry Review_, but what do  these saucy things care for that? Although they have the whole outside  world to range in, yet the garden seems to have a greater attraction  than all the rest. The other day we found it necessary to feed a weak  chicken in the garden by itself, so that it might be sure of its  share. A few minutes afterwards, on looking out of the window, we  discovered the weak chicken in the henyard and two Leghorn hens  finishing up its food. We went out, but the two robbers had fled.  Going around the corner, we found them rolling in a flower bed. A  Leghorn will do as much mischief in a garden in five minutes as  anything we know of.           *       *       *       *       *      SAWDUST IN ROUGH CASTING.    Siehr recommends very highly the use of sawdust in mortar as superior  even to hair for the prevention of cracking and subsequent peeling off  of rough casting under the action of storms and frost. His own house,  exposed to prolonged storms on the seacoast, had patches of mortar to  be renewed each spring, and after trying without effect a number of  substances to prevent it, he found sawdust perfectly satisfactory. It  was first thoroughly dried and sifted through an ordinary grain sieve  to remove the larger particles. The mortar was made by mixing 1 part  cement, 2 lime, 2 sawdust, and 5 sharp sand, the sawdust being first  well mixed dry with the cement and sand.           *       *       *       *       *      SUINT FOR WATERPROOFING FABRICS.--A German chemist has patented the  waterproofing of finely woven fabrics, linen, cotton, etc., by means  of suint composition. He adapts his method to securing the suint to  wool-washing establishments at a small cost.           *       *       *       *       *          ABSENCE OF WHITE COLOR IN ANIMALS.      Some very curious physiological facts bearing upon the presence or  absence of white colors in the higher animals have lately been adduced  by Dr. Ogle. It has been found that a colored or dark pigment in the  olfactory region of the nostrils is essential to perfect smell, and  this pigment is rarely deficient except when the whole animal is pure  white. In these cases the creature is almost without smell or taste.  This, Dr. Ogle believes, explains the curious case of the pigs in  Virginia adduced by Mr. Darwin, white pigs being poisoned by a  poisonous root which does not affect black pigs. Mr. Darwin imputed  this to a constitutional difference accompanying the dark color, which  rendered what was poisonous to the white colored animals quite  innocuous to the black. Dr. Ogle, however, observes that there is no  proof that the black pigs eat the root, and he believes the more  probable explanation to be that it is distasteful to them, while the  white pigs, being deficient in smell and taste, eat it, and are  killed. Analogous facts occur in several distinct families. White  sheep are killed in the Tarentino by eating _hypericum criscum_, while  black sheep escape; white rhinoceros are said to perish from eating  _euphorbia candelabrum_; and white horses are said to suffer from  poisonous food where colored ones escape. Now it is very improbable  that a constitutional immunity from poisoning by so many distinct  plants should, in the case of such widely different animals, be always  correlated with the same difference of color; but the facts are  readily understood if the senses of smell and taste are dependent on  the presence of a pigment which is deficient in wholly white animals.  The explanation has, however, been carried a step further by  experiments showing that the absorption of odors by dead matter, such  as clothing, is greatly affected by color, black being the most  powerful absorbent, then blue, red, yellow, and lastly white. We have  here a physical cause for the sense-inferiority of totally white  animals which may account for their rarity in nature. For few, if any,  wild animals are wholly white. The head, the face, or at least the  muzzle or the nose, are generally black. The ears and eyes are also  often black; and there is reason to believe that dark pigment is  essential to good hearing, as it certainly is to perfect vision. We  can therefore understand why white cats with blue eyes are so often  deaf--a peculiarity we notice more readily than their deficiency of  smell or taste.--_Dr. Wallace, British Association_, 1876.           *       *       *       *       *      IMPROVED TROLLING HOOK.    Mr. Henry C. Brush, of Brush's Mills, N.Y., has patented through the  Scientific American Patent Agency an improved troller, the novel  feature in which consists in attaching a float to the shank of the  implement under the revolving blade, the object being to keep the  troller near the surface of the water, where the fish may see it more  readily, and whereby the liability of catching in weeds and logs is  obviated.    [Illustration]    A is a float, attached to the shank, _a_, of the troller. B is the  spoon, which is swiveled in the usual manner. The device is very  simple, and is claimed to prevent all the annoyance arising from the  hook catching in sunken obstructions.           *       *       *       *       *      PURIFICATION OF WOOL AND WOOLEN STUFF.    The process, patented some time ago, for the removal of straw, burrs,  etc., from wool, by treatment with sulphuric acid, has been modified  by Lisc as follows: The stuff is worked for one to two hours in a bath  consisting of about 26 gallons sulphuric acid, of 3 deg. to 6 deg., 1 lb.  alum, 1/2 lb. salt, and 750 grains borax. It is then treated in a  centrifugal machine, and afterward subjected to a temperature of 212 deg.  to 248 deg.. For removal of the acid it is first washed with pure water  for 11/2 hours, then treated for two hours with fuller's earth, soda,  and lime, and finally washed for two hours with fresh water. As  sulphuric acid can only be employed with uncolored cloths, or such as  have been dyed with indigo, chloride of zinc and chloride of manganese  diluted to 6 deg. are substituted with fabrics otherwise dyed.           *       *       *       *       *      CAFFEONE.    Caffeone, the aromatic principle of coffee, may be isolated by  distilling 5 or 6 lbs. roasted coffee with water, agitating the  aqueous distillate with ether, and afterwards evaporating the ether.  It is a brown oil, heavier than water, in which it is only very  slightly soluble. An almost imponderable quantity of this essential  oil will suffice to aromatize a gallon of water.           *       *       *       *       *          THE HEMI-PLUNGER.      The novel form of vessel, to which the above odd name has been given  by its inventor, M. Donato Tommasi, of Paris, France, is a combination  of a boat wholly submerged with a raft: a connecting link, to borrow  the naturalist's expression, between the submerged torpedo boat and  the monitor. The advantages which are expected to be realized from  this hybrid craft, the inventor describes as follows: \"It is evident  that a vessel, plunged several yards below the surface of the sea, is  no longer influenced by wind or wave. Let the sea be agitated, let  there be the most violent tempest, yet the boat which navigates under  water will never be wrecked, for the same reason that a fish cannot be  drowned. * * * What a beautiful vision, that of traversing the ocean,  as a balloon floats through the air, with the same tranquillity,  without shocks, without the insupportable rolling and pitching!\" etc.  The construction of the invention introduced in this glowing manner  will be understood from Figs. 1 and 2. A is the plunger cylinder,  shown with its side broken away in Fig. 2. In Fig. 1, G is the rudder,  H the propeller, and I the tube through which sea water passes to the  pump. In Fig. 2, C is the smokestack, M M are compartments in which  water may be admitted to increase the weight, and hence the depth of  flotation of the plunger, the same being filled or emptied by the  pump, P. N is the hold for merchandise, partitioned off from the  boiler room as shown.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--TOMMASI'S HEMI-PLUNGER]    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--THE HEMI-PLUNGER, THE SUBMERGED PORTION]    From the plunger, A, rise two hollow columns, E, to which metallic  plates, F, are attached to diminish friction through the water. These  support the upper division or platform, B. The second shaft (not  lettered), which rises above the platform in Fig. 1, serves to  ventilate the plunger. The columns, E, serve as shoots down which  merchandise is lowered to the compartments, N; and their upper ends  are received in two immense inverted cups attached to the bottom of  the part, B.
