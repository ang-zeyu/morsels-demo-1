I used often  to wish I could manage to get up to him, but somehow I never could spare  time; but Easton did, though he was in the college four and was working  pretty hard too. I have known two or three other things he has done on  the quiet. I don't care for his way of dressing nor for his drawling way  of talking, in fact, I don't care for him at all personally; but he is a  good-natured fellow in spite of his nonsense.\"    \"Well, then, we must try him again,\" Skinner said, \"and see how he does  in the trial matches. There is no certainty about him, that is what I  hate; one day he plays up and does uncommonly well, then the next day he  does not seem to take a bit of interest in the game.\"    \"I have noticed several times,\" Scudamore said, \"that Easton's play  depends very much on the state of the game: if we are getting the best  of it he seems to think that there is no occasion to exert himself, but  if the game is going against us he pulls himself together and goes into  it with all his might.\"    \"He does that,\" Skinner agreed; \"that is what riles me in the fellow. He  can play a ripping good game when he likes, but then he does not always  like. However, as I said, we will give him another trial.\"    Half an hour later the subject of the conversation arrived. He was in  the first form on the classical side, and was going up at the next  examination for Sandhurst. Easton was one of the monitors, but seldom  asserted his authority or put himself out in any way to perform the  duties of the office. He was dressed with scrupulous care, and no one  from his appearance would have said that he had just come off a railway  journey. He nodded all round in a careless way as he came in, and there  was none of the boisterous friendliness that had marked the meeting of  most of the others.    \"Affected ass!\" Skinner growled to Rupert who was next to him.    \"You are a prejudiced beggar, Skinner,\" Rupert laughed. \"You know very  well he is not an ass, and I am not at all sure he is affected. I  suppose it is the way he has been brought up. There is no saying what  you might have been yourself if you had had nurses and people about you  who always insisted on your turning out spick-and-span. Well, Easton,  what have you been doing with yourself since we saw you last?\"    \"I have been on the Continent most of the time,\" Easton said, in the  quiet, deliberate tone that was so annoying to Skinner. \"Spent most of  the time in Germany: had a week at Munich, and the same time in Dresden  doing the picture-gallery.\"    \"That must have been a treat,\" Skinner said sarcastically.    \"Yes, it was very pleasant. The worst of it is, standing about so long  makes one's feet ache.\"    \"I wonder you did not have a bath-chair, Easton; delicate people go  about in them, you know.\"    \"It would be a very pleasant way, Skinner, only I don't think I could  bring myself to it.\"    There was a laugh at his taking Skinner's suggestion seriously.    \"What have you been doing, Skinner?\"    \"I have been up in Scotland climbing hills, and getting myself in good  condition for football,\" Skinner replied shortly.    \"Ah, football? Yes, I suppose we shall be playing football this term.\"    There was another laugh, excited principally by the angry growl with  which Skinner greeted this indifference to what was to him the principal  feature of the year.    \"I shouldn't mind football,\" Easton went on, after looking round as if  unable to understand what the others were laughing at, \"if it wasn't for  the dirt. Of course it is annoying to be kicked in the shins and to be  squeezed horribly in the greases, but it is the dirt I object to most.  If one could but get one's flannels and jerseys properly washed every  time it would not matter so much, but it is disgusting to have to put on  things that look as if they had been rolled in mud.\"    \"I wonder you play at all, Easton,\" Skinner said angrily.    \"Well, I wonder myself sometimes,\" Easton said placidly. \"I suppose it  is a relic of our original savage nature, when men did not mind dirt,  and lived by hunting and fighting and that sort of thing.\"    \"And had never learned the nuisance of stiff shirts and collars, and  never heard of such a thing as a tailor, and did not part their hair in  the middle, Easton, and had never used soap,\" Skinner broke in.    \"No; it must have been beastly,\" Easton said gravely. \"I am very glad  that I did not live in those days.\"    \"Ah, you would have suffered horribly if you had, wouldn't you?\"    \"Well, I don't know, Skinner; I suppose I should have done as other  people did. If one does not know the comfort of a wash and a clean  shirt, one would not miss it, you see. I have sometimes thought--\"    \"Oh, never mind what you thought,\" Skinner broke in out of all patience.  \"Come, let us go for a walk; it is no use stopping here all this fine  afternoon. Let us take a good long spin. I can see half you fellows are  out of condition altogether, and the sooner we begin work the better.  Will you come, Easton? After lolling about looking at pictures a  twelve-mile spin will do you good.\"    \"Thank you, Skinner; I don't know that I want any good done to me. I  should not mind a walk, if it is to be a walk; but a walk with you  generally means rushing across ploughed fields and jumping into ditches,  and getting one's self hot and uncomfortable, and splashing one's self  from head to foot. It is bad enough in flannels, but it is downright  misery in one's ordinary clothes. But I don't mind a game at rackets, if  anyone is disposed for it.\"    \"I will play you,\" Mossop said. \"I want to get my hand in before the  racket matches come off.\"    So they went and put on their flannels and racket shoes, while the rest  of the party started for a long walk with Skinner.    \"I am glad he has not come,\" the football captain said as they started;  \"he drives me out of all patience.\"    \"I don't think you have much to drive out of you, Skinner,\" Rupert  Clinton laughed. \"I believe Easton puts about half of it on, on purpose  to excite you. I am sure just now I saw a little amusement in his face  when he was talking so gravely.\"    \"He will find he has got in the wrong box,\" Skinner said angrily, \"if he  tries to chaff me.\"    A quiet smile was exchanged among the others, for Easton was tall and  well built and had the reputation of being the best boxer in the school;  and although Skinner was tough and wiry, he would have stood no chance  in an encounter with him.    \"Well, how did you get on, Mossop?\" Scudamore asked as they sat down to  tea.    \"Easton beat me every game. I had no idea that he was so good. He says  he does not intend to play for the racket, but if he did he would have a  first-rate chance. I was in the last ties last year and I ought to have  a good chance this, but either I am altogether out of practice or he is  wonderfully good. I was asking him, and he said in his lazy way that  they had got a decent racket-court at his place, and that he had been  knocking the balls about a bit since he came home.\"    \"If he is good enough to win,\" Pinkerton, the captain of the house,  said, \"he ought to play for the honour of the house. He has never played  in any matches here before. I did not know he played at all.\"    \"That is the way with Easton,\" Edgar Clinton said; \"he is good all  round, only he never takes trouble to show it. He could have been in the  college cricket eleven last year if he liked, only he said he could not  spare the time. Though Skinner doesn't think so, I believe he is one of  the best in our football team; when he chooses to exert himself he is  out and out the best chess player in the house; and I suppose he is safe  to pass in high for Sandhurst.\"    \"He is a queer fellow,\" Pinkerton said, \"one never knows what he can do  and what he can't. At the last exam Glover said that the papers he sent  in were far and away the best, but that he had only done the difficult  questions and hadn't sent in any answers at all to the easy ones, so  that instead of coming in first he was five or six down the list. I  believe myself he did not want to beat me, because if he had he would  have been head of the house, and that would have been altogether too  much trouble for him. Glover wanted him to go up for the last Indian  Civil, and told him he was sure that he could get in if he tried, but  Easton said he wasn't fond of heat and had no fancy for India.\"    \"I suppose he was afraid to take the starch out of his collars,\" Edgar  laughed. \"Ah! here he is; late as usual.\"    Easton strolled quietly in and took his place, looking annoyingly fresh  and clean by the side of those who had accompanied Skinner on his walk,  and who, in spite of vigorous use of clothes brushes, showed signs of  cross-country running.    \"Have you had a pleasant walk?\" he asked calmly.    \"Very pleasant,\" Skinner said, in a tone that defied contradiction. \"A  delightful walk; just the thing for getting a little into condition.\"    There was a murmur of assent among the boys who had accompanied him, but  there was no great heartiness in the sound; for indeed Skinner had  pressed them all to a much higher rate of speed than was pleasant in  their ordinary clothes, although they would not have minded it in  flannels.    \"You all look as if you had enjoyed it,\" Easton said, regarding them one  by one with an air of innocent approval; \"warmed yourselves up a bit, I  should say. I remark a general disappearance of collars, and Rupert  Clinton's face is scratched as if he had been having a contest with some  old lady's cat."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#6)"],[1,"as showing that Abhira was not originally  an occupational term for a herdsman, nor a caste name, but belonged  to an immigrant tribe. Owing apparently to the fact that the Abhiras,  like the Gujars, devoted themselves to a pastoral mode of life in  India, whereas the previous Aryan immigrants had settled down to  cultivation, they gave their name to the great occupational caste  of herdsmen which was subsequently developed, and of which they may  originally have constituted the nucleus. The Gujars, who came to India  at a later period, form a parallel case; although the Gujar caste,  which is derived from them, is far less important than the Ahir,  the Gujars have also been the parents of several Rajput clans. The  reason why the early Mathura legends of Krishna make no mention of  the Ahirs may be that the deity Krishna is probably compounded of at  least two if not more distinct personalities. One is the hero chief of  the Yadavas, who fought in the battle of the Pandavas and Kauravas,  migrated to Gujarat and was killed there. As he was chief of the  Yadavas this Krishna must stand for the actual or mythical personality  of some leader of the immigrant nomad tribes. The other Krishna,  the boy cowherd, who grazed cattle and sported with the milkmaids of  Brindaban, may very probably be some hero of the indigenous non-Aryan  tribes, who, then as now, lived in the forests and were shepherds  and herdsmen. His lowly birth from a labouring cowherd, and the  fact that his name means black and he is represented in sculpture  as being of a dark colour, lend support to this view. The cult of  Krishna, Mr. Crooke points out, was comparatively late, and probably  connected with the development of the worship of the cow after the  decay of Buddhism. This latter Krishna, who is worshipped with his  mother as a child-god, was especially attractive to women, both actual  and prospective mothers. It is quite probable therefore that as his  worship became very popular in Hindustan in connection with that of  the cow, he was given a more illustrious origin by identification  with the Yadava hero, whose first home was apparently in Gujarat. In  this connection it may also be noted that the episodes connected with  Krishna in the Mahabharata have been considered late interpolations.        5. The modern Ahirs an occupational caste.      But though the Ahir caste takes its name and is perhaps partly  descended from the Abhira tribe, there is no doubt that it is now  and has been for centuries a purely occupational caste, largely  recruited from the indigenous tribes. Thus in Bengal Colonel Dalton  remarks that the features of the Mathuravasi Goalas are high, sharp  and delicate, and they are of light-brown complexion. Those of the  Magadha subcaste, on the other hand, are undefined and coarse. They  are dark-complexioned, and have large hands and feet. \"Seeing the  latter standing in a group with some Singhbhum Kols, there is no  distinguishing one from the other. There has doubtless been much  mixture of blood.\" [24] Similarly in the Central Provinces the Ahirs  are largely recruited from the Gonds and other tribes. In Chanda the  Gowaris are admittedly descended from the unions of Gonds and Ahirs,  and one of their subcastes, the Gond-Gowaris, are often classed as  Gonds. Again, the Kaonra Ahirs of Mandla are descended from the unions  of Ahirs either with the Gonds or Kawars, and many of them are probably  pure Gonds. They have Gond sept-names and eat pork. Members of one  of their subdivisions, the Gond-Kaonra, will take water from Gonds,  and rank below the other Kaonras, from whom they will accept food and  water. As cattle have to go into the thick jungles to graze in the hot  weather, the graziers attending them become intimate with the forest  tribes who live there, and these latter are also often employed to  graze the cattle, and are perhaps after a time admitted to the Ahir  caste. Many Ahirs in Mandla are scarcely considered to be Hindus,  living as they do in Gond villages in sole company with the Gonds.        6. Subcastes.      The principal subcastes of the Ahirs in northern India are the  Jaduvansi, Nandvansi and Gowalvansi. The Jaduvansi claimed to be  descended from the Yadavas, who now form the Yadu and Jadon-Bhatti  clans of Rajputs. The probability of a historical connection between  the Abhiras and Yadavas has already been noticed. The Nandvansi  consider their first ancestor to have been Nand, the cowherd, the  foster-father of Krishna; while the name of the Gowalvansi is simply  Goala or Gauli, a milkman, a common synonym for the caste. The Kaonra  Ahirs of Mandla and the Kamarias of Jubbulpore are considered to belong  to the Nandvansi group. Other subcastes in the northern Districts are  the Jijhotia, who, like the Jijhotia Brahmans, take their name from  Jajhoti, the classical term for Bundelkhand; the Bharotia; and the  Narwaria from Narwar. The Rawats of Chhattisgarh are divided into the  Jhadia, Kosaria and Kanaujia groups. Of these the Jhadia or 'jungly,'  and Kosaria from Kosala, the ancient name of the Chhattisgarh country,  are the oldest settlers, while the Kanaujia are largely employed as  personal servants in Chhattisgarh, and all castes will take water  from their hands. The superior class of them, however, refuse to  clean household cooking vessels, and are hence known as Thethwar,  or exact or pure, as distinguished from the other Rawats, who will  perform this somewhat derogatory work.        7. The Dauwa or wet-nurse Ahirs. Fosterage.      The Dauwa or wet-nurse Ahirs are descended from the illegitimate  offspring of Bundela Rajput fathers by Ahir mothers who were employed  in this capacity in their families. An Ahir woman kept by a Bundela  was known as Pardwarin, or one coming from another house. This is  not considered a disgraceful origin; though the Dauwa Ahirs are not  recognised by the Ahirs proper, they form a separate section of the  caste, and Brahmans will take water from them. The children of such  mothers stood in the relation of foster-brothers to the Rajputs,  whom their mothers had nursed. The giving of milk, in accordance with  the common primitive belief in the virtue attaching to an action  in itself, was held to constitute a relation of quasi-maternity  between the nurse and infant, and hence of fraternity between her own  children and her foster-children. The former were called Dhai-bhais  or foster-brothers by the Rajputs; they were often given permanent  grants of land and employed on confidential missions, as for the  arrangement of marriages. The minister of a Raja of Karauli was  his Dauwa or foster-father, the husband of his nurse. Similarly,  Colonel Tod says that the Dhai-bhai or foster-brother of the Raja  of Boondi, commandant of the fortress of Tanagarh, was, like all  his class, devotion personified. [25] A parallel instance of the  tie of foster-kinship occurs in the case of the foster-brothers of  Conachar or Hector in _The Fair Maid of Perth_. Thus the position  of foster-brother of a Rajput was an honourable one, even though  the child might be illegitimate. Ahir women were often employed as  wet-nurses, because domestic service was a profession in which they  commonly engaged. Owing to the comparatively humble origin of a large  proportion of them they did not object to menial service, while the  purity of their caste made it possible to use them for the supply  of water and food. In Bengal the Uriya Ahirs were a common class of  servants in European houses.    The Gaolis or milkmen appear to form a distinct branch of the caste  with subcastes of their own. Among them are the Nandvans, common to  the Ahirs, the Malwi from Malwa and the Raghuvansi, called after the  Rajput clan of that name. The Ranyas take their designation from _ran_,  forest, like the Jhadia Rawats.        8. Exogamy.      The caste have exogamous sections, which are of the usual low-caste  type, with titular or totemistic names. Those of the Chhattisgarhi  Rawats are generally named after animals. A curious name among the  Mahakul Ahirs is Mathankata, or one who bit his mother's nipples. The  marriage of persons belonging to the same section and of first cousins  is prohibited. A man may marry his wife's younger sister while his  wife is living, but not her elder sister. The practice of exchanging  girls between families is permissible.        9. Marriage customs.      As a rule, girls may be married before or after puberty, but the  Golkars of Chanda insist on infant marriage, and fine the parents if  an unmarried girl becomes adolescent. On the other hand, the Kaonra  Ahirs of Mandla make a practice of not getting a girl married till  the signs of puberty have appeared. It is said that in Mandla if an  unmarried girl becomes pregnant by a man of the caste the _panchayat_  give her to him and fine him Rs. 20 or 30, which they appropriate  themselves, giving nothing to the father. If an Ahir girl is seduced  by an outsider, she is made over to him, and a fine of Rs. 40 or 50  is exacted from him if possible. This is paid to the girl's father,  who has to spend it on a penalty feast to the caste. Generally,  sexual offences within the community are leniently regarded. The  wedding ceremony is of the type prevalent in the locality. The  proposal comes from the boy's family, and a price is usually given  for the bride. The Kaonra Ahirs of Mandla and the Jharia and Kosaria  Rawats of Chhattisgarh employ a Brahman only to write the _lagun_ or  paper fixing the date of the wedding, and the ceremony is conducted  by the _sawasins_ or relatives of the parties. In Chhattisgarh the  bridegroom is dressed as a girl to be taken to the wedding. In Betul  the weddings of most Gaolis are held in Magh (January), and that of  the Ranya subcaste in the bright fortnight of Kartik (October). At  the ceremony the bride is made to stand on a small stone roller; the  bridegroom then"]]]
