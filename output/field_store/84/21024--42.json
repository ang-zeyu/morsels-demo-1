The north side of the cathedral lies within the gardens of the bishop's  palace, which can be entered from the interior of the cathedral, through  a small door in the north aisle of the presbytery; the eastern end of  the cathedral also lies within a private garden, but permission to enter  it can usually be obtained.    #Exterior of Nave.#--Those portions of the precincts near the western  end of the cathedral are known as the Upper Close; and, walking round  the exterior of the cloisters, we come to the Lower Close. The nave on  the south side can be seen well either from the upper or lower Close,  and can be better examined in detail from the interior of the cloisters.  Its elevation consists of fourteen bays divided by flat Norman  buttresses. In height it is composed of what, at first sight, appears a  bewildering confusion of arches, arcades, and windows. Over the aisle  windows, hidden by the north walk of cloisters, comes a Norman wall  arcading; and over this the Norman triforium windows blocked up, and  again, above the later Perpendicular triforium, superimposed on the old,  and finished with a battlemented parapet. Behind this come the triforium  roof, and then beyond the original Norman clerestory, each bay with a  triple arch formation, the centre arch pierced for a window. And then  above all, the lead roof over nave vault.    The radical changes that have taken place since the nave was built by  Bishop Eborard (1121-45) consist of the insertion in the aisles of later  \"Decorated\" traceried windows in place of the original Norman ones, and  of the superimposition, before referred to, at triforium level of a  whole range of \"Perpendicular\" windows over the old Norman work, which  were blocked up at this period. The pristine aspect, then, of this  elevation of the nave would have shown a sloping roof over the aisles  where now the later addition occurs. The battlementing, too, over the  clerestory to the nave is later work, to correspond with battlementing  over the triforium windows. It will be noticed that the two bays next  the transept in the triforium are higher than the others, in order to  throw additional light into the choir.    Also on this same south side, in the seventh and eighth bays from the  west end, two very late windows occur, inserted in the Norman arcading  under the original triforium windows; these were inserted by Bishop  Nykke to light the chapel he built in two bays of the south aisle of the  nave.    The curious raking of the lead rolls to the nave roof is noticeable; the  mediaeval builders did this with a view of counteracting the \"crawl\" of  the lead. Lead, under the variations of temperature of the atmosphere,  expands and contracts considerably; and from its own weight, and the  steepness of the roofs, the contraction takes place in a downward  direction, and starts the joints, letting in the weather. This raking of  the vertical rolls was a device whereby the old builders in some measure  got over their difficulty by inducing a fixed expansion and contraction.    [Illustration: The Clerestory and Triforium of Choir (South Side).]    #The South Transept# projects boldly forward from under the tower;  without aisles, its ridge and parapet correspond in height to those of  the nave; this narrowness, with the tower and spire showing over  behind, gives it an appearance of height, as approached from the lower  close. This effect of height is emphasised by the partition of the  design in its width, by flat Norman buttresses, with shafts in the  angles, and by the flat faces of the flanking turrets. The work,  however, is without interest, from the fact that, though the _ensemble_  in some measure has been retained, the whole of the exterior face of the  stonework was re-cased by Salvin, 1830-40, during which period various  restorations were effected. Before these alterations, the Norman  flanking turrets finished with a \"Perpendicular\" battlementing, enriched  with shields and quatrefoils, and with crocketted pinnacles set at the  four angles; this battlementing was removed, and the present  uninteresting pepper-boxes took their place. No doubt they have it in  their favour that they _may_ be more like the original Norman  terminations than were those they replaced, which were, however, real  \"Perpendicular,\" and these are only sham Norman. Originally, from the  eastward side of the south transept, projected a semi-circular chapel,  shown on plan by dotted lines, and corresponding to that still remaining  on the north side of the cathedral. It was part of the original plan,  and though we believe no record exists of its destruction, it can safely  be premised that its fate came about through the _cultus_ of the saint  to whom it was dedicated declining, and consequent neglect and ruin  following made its destruction cheaper than its reparation. It was  replaced by a sacristy in the fifteenth century, the lines of roof to  which can still be seen over on the stonework. This later sacristy was  destroyed by the fire of 1509, that burned as well the wooden roofs of  the transepts, and necessitated the stone vaults added by Bishop Nykke.    #The Diocesan Registry Offices# now occupy the space on which once stood  the Norman chapel, and later the Sacristy.    The building projecting eastward, south of this space, and marked A on  plan, was once a chapel, said by Blomefield to have been dedicated to  St. Edmund. It is now used as the #Dean's Vestry# in the lower storey,  and as the #Chapter Clerk's Office# in the upper.    At the same time that the later restorations were effected to the south  transept, the groined #Slype# and singing-school above it were  destroyed, and the present door in the south transept from the lower  close was opened. A pre-restoration view is published of the east end  of the cathedral, showing the slype, in Britton's \"Norwich.\" The visitor  should also bear in mind that this space immediately in front of the  south transept was originally occupied by the #Chapter-House#, situated  as shown by dotted lines on plan, and separated from the cathedral by  the slype. The entrance arches to the chapter-house from the east walk  of the cloisters still remain and fix definitely its position; it  projected eastward about eighty feet.    #The Tower and Spire# mark the crossing of the choir and transepts, the  tower only being Norman, and square on plan, with flat Norman  buttresses, covered with vertical shafts on the face of each. These  buttresses start from the level of the parapets to Nave, Transept, and  Presbytery, and rise right up until, well over the parapet of the tower,  they are finished by crocketted pinnacles. Between these buttresses are  horizontal bands of design: the lowest, a Norman arcade of nine arches,  three of which are pierced as windows; then, above this, a smaller wall  arcade with interlaced arches; and then, above again, the principal  feature, an arcading of nine arches, three pierced for windows, and the  others filled with wall tracery of diamonds and circles; then, between  this last and the battlemented parapet, occur five vertical panels, each  comprising two circles, the upper pierced for a window. Above, soaring  upward, rises the later crocketted spire. Herbert, the founder, provided  the foundations of tower, and probably carried up the walls to the level  of the nave roof; the rest of the tower was finished during the reign of  Henry I., and is a beautiful specimen of the work of that time; but here  again our sentiment and sympathy experience a shock when we learn that  the stonework was almost entirely refaced in 1856. The tower was crowned  by a wooden spire from 1297; this was blown down in 1361, and probably  brought away in its fall some part of the Norman turrets of the tower.  It fell eastward, damaging the presbytery so badly that the clerestory  had to be rebuilt. The wooden spire was reconstructed probably at the  same time, though no record exists of such work, and the present Early  Perpendicular turrets were added. The spire, we know, was again  overtaken by misfortune in 1463, when it was struck by lightning, and  again falling eastward, went through the presbytery roof. The present  spire was then constructed in stone by Bishop Lyhart (1446-72), and  was finished by his successor, Bishop Goldwell (1472-99), who added the  battlements.    [Illustration: The Tower in 1816.]    It will hardly be necessary to enlarge on the beauty of this spire of  Norwich, as the dominant feature, seen from the south-east, rising above  the curved sweep of the apse, and strongly buttressed by the south  transept, it stands up, clearly defined against the western sky, and  points upward, significant and symbolical at once of the ends and  aspirations of the church below.    #The Eastern Arm of Cathedral or Presbytery# takes its history from the  tower. Here, as in the nave, there are the original triforium windows  blocked up, and a range of Perpendicular work superimposed on the old.  Above and beyond this, supported between each bay by flying buttresses,  comes the transitional Decorated to Perpendicular clerestory,  considerably higher than the original Norman clerestory remaining to the  nave. At the base of each flying buttress are figures of saints. The  roof and Norman clerestory were damaged by the falling tower in 1361,  but were rebuilt by Bishop Percy, 1355-69. This work is transitional  Decorated to Perpendicular. The presbytery was then re-roofed with a  framed timber construction, which was consumed by the falling of the  burning spire, struck by lightning in 1463. The present stone vault was  added in its place by Bishop Goldwell, 1472-99. This necessitated the  addition as well of flying buttresses to take the thrust of the vault.

One of the best exercises for the mastery of this system is to open the  unabridged dictionary at any point and copy out lists of words, writing the  words as they ordinarily appear in one column, and in an adjoining column  the phonetic form of the word.  When the list is complete, cover one column  and reproduce the other from an application of the principles that have  been learned.  After a few days, reproduce the phonetic forms from the  words as ordinarily written, and again the ordinary word from the phonetic  form.  Avoid memorizing as much as possible, but work solely by the  application of principles.  Never write down a phonetic form without fully  understanding its meaning in every detail.  A key to the various marks will  be found at the bottom of every page of the dictionary, and the student  should refer to this frequently.  In the front part of the dictionary there  will also be found an explanation of all possible sounds that any letter  may have; and every sound that any letter may have may be indicated by a  peculiar mark, so that since several letters may represent the same sound  there are a variety of symbols for the same sound.  For the purposes of  this book it has seemed best to offer only one symbol for each sound, and  that symbol the one most frequently used.  For that reason the following  example will not correspond precisely with the forms given in the  dictionary, but a study of the differences will afford a valuable exercise.    Illustration.*     *In this exercise, vowels before r marked in webster with the double  curve used over the Spanish n, are left unmarked.  Double o with the  short sound is also left unmarked.

Note.  In Webster's dictionary letters which are unmarked have an  obscure sound often not unlike uh, or are silent, and letters printed  in italics are nearly elided, so very slight is the sound they have if  it can be said to exist at all.  In the illustration above, all very  obscure sounds have been replaced by the apostrophe, while no distinction  has been made between short vowels in accented and unaccented syllables.    Studies from the Dictionary.    The following are taken from Webster's Dictionary:    Ab-do`m'-i-nou`s:  The _a_ in _ab_ is only a little shorter than _a_ in  _at,_ and the _i_ is short being unaccented, while the _o_ is silent,  the syllable having the sound nus as indicated by the mark over the _u_.    Le`ss'_e_n, (le`s'n), le`s's_o_n, (le`s'sn), le`ss'er, le`s'sor:  Each of  these words has two distinct syllables, though there is no recognizable  vowel sound in the last syllables of the first two.  This eliding of the  vowel is shown by printing the _e_ and the _o_ of the final syllables  in italics.  In the last two words the vowels of the final syllables are  not marked, but have nearly the sound they would have if marked in the  usual way for _e_ and _o_ before _r_.  As the syllables are not accented  the vowel sound is slightly obscured.  Or in _lessor_ has the sound of  the word _or_ (nearly), not the sound of _or_ in _honor,_ which will be  found re-spelled (o`n'ur).  It will be noted that the double s is  divided in two of the words and not in the other two.  In _lesser_ and  _lessen_ all possible stress is placed on the first syllables,  since the terminations have the least possible value in speaking;  but in _lesson_ and _lessor_ we put a little more stress on the final  syllables, due to the greater dignity of the letter _o,_  and this draws over a part of the s sound.    Hon'-ey-co:mb (hu`n'y-ko:m): The heavy{ second} hyphen indicates that  this is a compound word and the hyphen must always be written.  The hyphens printed lightly in the dictionary merely serve to separate  the syllables and show how a word may be divided at the end of a line.  The student will also note that the _o_ in _-comb_ has its full long  value instead of being slighted.  This slight added stress on the _o_  is the way we have in speaking of indicating that _-comb_ was once a  word by itself, with an accent of its own.    Exercise.  Select other words from the dictionary, and analyse as we have done  above, giving some explanation for every peculiarity found in the  printing and marks.  Continue this until there is no doubt or hesitation  in regard to the meaning of any mark that may be found.      CHAPTER II.    WORD-BUILDING.    English speaking peoples have been inclined to exaggerate the  irregularities of the English word-formation.  The fact is, only a small  number of common words and roots are irregular in formation, while fully  nine tenths of all the words in the language are formed according to  regular principles, or are regularly derived from the small number of  irregular words.  We use the irregular words so much more frequently  that they do indeed constitute the greater part of our speech,  but it is very necessary that we should master the regular principles  of word-building, since they give us a key to the less frequently used,  but far more numerous, class which fills the dictionary, teaching us  both the spelling of words of which we know the sound, and the  pronunciation of words which we meet for the first time in reading.    Accent.  In English, accent is an essential part of every word.  It is something of an art to learn to throw it on to any syllable we  choose, for unless we are able to do this we cannot get the true  pronunciation of a word from the dictionary and we are helpless when we  are called on to pronounce a word we have never heard.    Perhaps the best way to learn the art of throwing accent is by  comparing words in which we are in the habit of shifting the  accent to one syllable or another according to the meaning,  as for instance the following:     1.  Accent.    a.  What _ac'cent_ has this word?    b.  With what _accent'uation_ do you _accent'_ this word?     2.  Concert.    a.  Did you go to the _con'cert_ last night?    b.  By _concert'ed_ action we can do anything.     3.  Contrast.    {a} b.  What a _con'trast_ between the rich man and the poor man!    b.  _Contrast'_ good with bad, black with white, greatness with littleness.     4.  Permit.    a.  I have a building_-per'mit_.    b.  My mother will not _permit'_ me to go.     5.  Present.    a.  He received a beautiful Christmas _pres'ent_.    b.  She was _present'ed_ at court.     6.  Prefix.    a.  Sub is a common _pre'fix_.    b.  _Prefix'_ sub to port and you get support.     7.  Compound.    a.  He can _compound'_ medicine like a druggist.    b.  Nitroglycerine is a dangerous _com'pound_.    As a further illustration, read the following stanza of poetry,  especially accenting the syllables as marked:         Tell' me not' in mourn'ful num'bers,         \"Life' is but' an emp'ty dream'!\"       For' the soul' is dead' that slum'bers,         And' things are' not what' they seem'.    This is called scanning, and all verse may be scanned in the same way.  It is an excellent drill in learning the art of throwing the stress of  the voice on any syllable that may be desired.    Two Laws of Word-Formation.    We are now prepared to consider the two great laws governing  word-formation.  These are:    1.  Law: All vowels in combination with consonants are naturally short  unless the long sound is given by combination with other vowels,  by accent, or by position in the syllable with reference to consonants.    2.  Law: Words derived from other words by the addition of prefixes or  suffixes always retain the original form as far as possible.    1.  We are likely to suppose that the natural or original sound of a  vowel is the long sound, because that is the sound we give it when  naming it in the alphabet.  If we will examine a number of words,  however, we shall soon see that in combination with consonants  all vowels have a tendency to a short or obscure pronunciation.  The sounds of the consonants are naturally obscure, and they  draw the vowels to a similar obscurity.    Since such is the case, when a vowel is given its long sound there is  always a special reason for it.  In the simple words _not, pin, her,  rip, rid, cut, met,_ we"]]]
