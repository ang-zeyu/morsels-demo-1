Motion is a fact seen by the eye, felt by the hand; it enters into us  by the perception we have of the solid masses visible to the naked eye  which exist in our field of observation, of their movements and their  equilibrium and the displacement we ourselves effect with our bodies.  Here is the sensory origin, very humble and very gross, of all the  mechanics of the atoms. Here is the stuff of which our lofty  conception is formed. Our mind can, it is true, by a work of  purification, strip movement of most of its concrete qualities,  separate it even from the perception of the object in motion, and make  of it a something or other ideal and diagrammatic; but there will  still remain a residuum of visual, tactile, and muscular sensations,  and consequently it is still nothing else than a subjective state,  bound to the structure of our organs. We are, for the rest, so  wrapped up in sensations that none of our boldest conceptions can  break through the circle.    But it is not the notion of movement alone which proceeds from  sensation. There is also that of exteriority, of space, of position,  and, by opposition, that of external or psychological events. Without  declaring it to be certain, I will remind you that it is infinitely  probable that these notions are derived from our muscular experience.  Free motion, arrested motion, the effort, the speed, and the direction  of motion, such are the sensorial elements, which, in all probability,  constitute the foundation of our ideas on space and its properties.  And those are so many subjective notions which we have no right to  treat as objects belonging to the outer world.    What is more remarkable, also, is that even the ideas of object, of  body, and of matter, are derived from visual and tactile sensations  which have been illegitimately set up as entities. We have come, in  fact, to consider matter as a being separate from sensations, superior  to our sensations, distinct from the properties which enable us to  know it, and binding together these properties, as it were, in a  sheaf. Here again is a conception at the base of visualisation and  muscularisation; it consists in referring to the visual and other  sensations, raised for the occasion to the dignity of external and  permanent causes, the other sensations which are considered as the  effects of the first named upon our organs of sense.    It demands a great effort to clear our minds of these familiar  conceptions which, it is plain are nothing but naive realism. Yes! the  mechanical conception of the universe is nothing but naive realism.    To recapitulate our idea, and, to make it more plain by an  illustration, here is a tuning-fork on the table before me. With a  vigorous stroke of the bow I set it vibrating. The two prongs  separate, oscillate rapidly, and a sound of a certain tone is heard. I  connect this tuning-fork, by means of electric wires, with a Deprez  recording apparatus which records the vibrations on the blackened  surface of a revolving cylinder; and we can thus, by an examination of  the trace made under our eyes, ascertain all the details of the  movement which animates it. We see, parallel to each other, two  different orders of phenomena; the visual phenomena which show us that  the tuning-fork is vibrating, and the auditory phenomena which convey  to us the fact that it is making a sound.    The physicist, asked for an explanation of all this, will answer: \"It  is the vibration of the tuning-fork which, transmitted by the air, is  carried to our auditory apparatus, causes a vibration in the  tympanum, the movements of which are communicated to the small bones  of the middle ear, thence (abridging details) to the terminations of  the auditory nerve, and so produces in us the subjective sensation of  sound.\" Well, in so saying, the physicist commits an error of  interpretation; outside our ears there exists something we do not know  which excites them; this something cannot be the vibratory movement of  the tuning-fork, for this vibratory movement which we can see is  likewise a subjective sensation; it no more exists outside our sight  than sound exists outside our ears. In any case, it is as absurd to  explain a sensation of sound by one of sight, as a sensation of sight  by one of sound.    One would be neither further from nor nearer to the truth if we  answered that physicist as follows: \"You give the preponderance to  your eye; I myself give it to my ear. This tuning-fork appears to you  to vibrate. Wrong! This is how the thing occurs. This tuning-fork  produces a sound which, by exciting our retina, gives us a sense of  movement. This visual sensation of vibration is a purely subjective  one, the external cause of the phenomenon is the sound. The outer  world is a concert of sounds which rises in the immensity of space.  Matter is noise and nothingness is silence.\"    This theory of the above experiment is not absurd; but, as a matter  of fact, it is probable that no one would or could accept it, except  verbally for amusement, as a challenge, or for the pleasure of talking  metaphysics. The reason is that all our evolution, for causes which  would take too long to detail, has established the hegemony of certain  of our senses over the others. We have, above all, become visual and  manual beings. It is the eye and the hand which give us the  perceptions of the outer world of which we almost exclusively make use  in our sciences; and we are now almost incapable of representing to  ourselves the foundation of phenomena otherwise than by means of these  organs. Thus all the preceding experiment from the stroke of the bow  to the final noise presents itself to us in visual terms, and further,  these terms are not confined to a series of detached sensations.    Visual sensation combines with the tactile and muscular sensations,  and forms sensorial constructions which succeed each, other, continue,  and arrange themselves logically: in lieu of sensations, there are  objects and relations of space between these objects, and the actions  which connect them, and the phenomena which pass from one to the  other. All that is only sensation, if you will; but merely as the  agglutinated molecules of cement and of stone are a palace.    Thus the whole series of visual events which compose our experiment  with the tuning-fork can be coherently explained. One understands that  It is the movement of my hand equipped with the bow which is  communicated to the tuning-fork. One understands that this movement  passing into the fork has changed its form and rhythm, that the waves  produced by the fork transmit themselves, by the oscillations of the  air-molecules, to our tympanum, and so on. There is in all this series  of experiments an admirable continuity which fully satisfies our  minds. However much we might be convinced by the theoretical reasons  given above, that we have quite as much right to represent the same  series of events in an auditory form, we should be incapable of  realising that form to ourselves.    What would be the structure of the ear to any one who only knew it  through the sense of hearing? What would become of the tympanum, the  small bones, the cochlea, and the terminations of the acoustic nerve,  if it were only permitted to represent them in the language of sound?  It is very difficult to imagine.    Since, however, we are theorising, let us not be stopped by a few  difficulties of comprehension. Perhaps a little training might enable  us to overcome them. Perhaps musicians, who discern as much reality in  what one hears as in what one sees, would be more apt than other folk  to understand the necessary transposition. Some of them, in their  autobiographies, have made, by the way, very suggestive remarks on the  importance they attribute to sound: and, moreover, the musical world,  with its notes, its intervals, and its orchestration, lives and  develops in a manner totally independent of vibration.    Perhaps we can here quote one or two examples which may give us a  lead. To measure the length of a body instead of applying to it a  yard-wand, one might listen to its sound; for the pitch of the sound  given by two cords allows us to deduce their difference of length, and  even the absolute length of each. The chemical composition of a body  might be noted by its electric resistance and the latter verified by  the telephone; that is to say, by the ear. Or, to take a more subtle  example. We might make calculations with sounds of which we have  studied the harmonic relations as we do nowadays with figures. A sum  in rule of three might even be solved sonorously; for, given three  sounds, the ear can find a fourth which should have the same relation  to the third as the second to the first. Every musical ear performs  this operation easily; now, this fourth sound, what else is it but the  fourth term in a rule of three? And by taking into consideration the  number of its vibrations a numerical solution would be found to the  problem. This novel form of calculating machine might serve to fix  the price of woollen stuffs, to calculate brokerages and percentages,  and the solution would be obtained without the aid of figures, without  calculation, without visualisation, and by the ear alone.    By following up this idea, also, we might go a little further. We  might arrive at the conviction that our present science is human,  petty, and contingent; that it is closely linked with the structure of  our sensory organs; that this structure results from the evolution  which fashioned these organs; that this evolution has been an accident  of history; that in the future it may be different; and that,  consequently, by the side or in the stead of our modern science, the  work of our eyes and hands--and also of our words--there might have  been constituted, there may still be constituted,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],[0,"The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#6)"],[1,"licked them  all clean.\"    \"That disagreeable Miss Snooper has spoiled everything for us,\" Moses  Mouse declared. And for a fat gentleman he looked oddly unhappy.    \"I don't know what we'll do for our supper,\" he whined. He always whined  when he was hungry.    \"There's that chunk of putty that Farmer Green left in the woodshed,\"  his wife reminded him.    \"Ugh!\" Moses Mouse made a wry face. \"We've dined upon that for the last  three nights. And I never did like putty, anyhow. I wish that snooping  Miss Snooper had to eat it.\" His mournful eyes roved about the cellar  until they rested on something in a dark corner. \"What's in that box  over there?\" he asked Mrs. Mouse.    \"I don't know,\" she answered.    \"Well--go and see, then!\" he snapped. \"I'm so faint I can scarcely  stand.\"    Mrs. Mouse always humored Moses when he was hungry. She knew that he was  never fretful after he had eaten a good meal. So her feet twinkled  across the cellar floor and she disappeared inside the box.    Not hearing anything from her, Moses Mouse soon grew more impatient than  ever.    \"Well!\" he sang out. \"What luck!\"    \"Potatoes!\" came his wife's muffled answer, out of a full mouth. \"I  declare, I forgot to call you.\"          XVII    THE EAVESDROPPER      FOR ANYBODY that was so faint, Moses Mouse ran to the box of potatoes  very spryly. His wife was already inside it, eating.    \"I'll have my supper first,\" he announced, \"while you stay outside on  the cellar bottom and watch for Miss Snooper.\"    \"I'm just as hungry as you are,\" his wife objected. \"I don't want to  wait. You know you'll be a long time at your supper.\" What she really  meant was that Moses Mouse would be sure to overeat.    \"Very well!\" he said. \"But don't blame me if Miss Snooper sneaks up on  us.\"    Thereupon Moses Mouse fell to right greedily. Although there were  delicacies that he liked more than raw potatoes, he was hungry enough to  enjoy them--and not even ask for salt. And his wife, too, ate almost as  heartily as he did. The pale moonlight, streaming through the cellar  window, lighted their banquet hall with its ghostly gleams. They enjoyed  the cool dampness of the place. They liked its musty smell. And Moses  Mouse remarked--between mouthfuls--that they hadn't had such an elegant  feast for weeks. \"It's quite like old times,\" he said.    Mrs. Mouse agreed with him. Indeed, they relished their meal so  thoroughly that they forgot everything else. And if Moses Mouse hadn't  happened to glance up and see two eyes gleaming at him from over the  edge of the box he would have had no reason for leaving his meal  unfinished. At the moment, his mouth was crammed so full of raw potato  that he could scarcely say a word.    \"Miss Snooper!\" he gasped, all but choking over the words. And he  vanished in a twinkling, hoping, of course, that Mrs. Mouse would take  the hint and disappear too, but not waiting to see whether she managed  to get away safely.    A second later Miss Kitty Cat sprang into the box. She reached out a paw  and grabbed at what looked like Mrs. Mouse. But to her great disgust she  found her claws clutching nothing more interesting than a small potato,  with a little knob at one end that looked not unlike a head.    Miss Kitty Cat let go of her prize with a mew of disappointment. She  knew that by that time Mr. and Mrs. Mouse had made their escape. And  Miss Kitty soon learned how they slipped away. In one corner of the box  she found a tiny hole. \"Here's where they went!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't  see how I missed seeing it when I first came sniffing around this box.\"    Though she had lost a midnight supper, Miss Kitty did not feel too sad.  She was too angry for that.    \"At last,\" she cried, \"I've found out what old dog Spot wouldn't tell  me. The mice are calling me 'Miss Snooper' behind my back!\"    In the morning, when Miss Kitty met old dog Spot in the woodshed, she  was still feeling peevish. \"What are you doing in here?\" she snapped.    \"Oh, I'm just snooping around to see what I can find for my breakfast,\"  he told her with a grin.    Miss Kitty Cat bared her teeth in a snarl.    \"_Snooping!_\" she cried. \"You'd better be careful what you say to me! I  heard some mice talking last night.\"    \"Ah!\" said old Spot. \"Now you know that listeners seldom hear anything  good about themselves.\"    Then he decided, suddenly, that he would look elsewhere for his  breakfast.    For Miss Kitty Cat was in a terrible temper.          XVIII    KIDNAPPED      THERE was great rejoicing among all the Mouse family. Pudgy Mr. Moses  Mouse had picked up a bit of news that delighted him and his wife and  all their many relations. Somebody had stolen Miss Snooper--as the Mouse  family always called Miss Kitty Cat! Somebody had taken her away!    Master Meadow Mouse had seen it all; and he had told Moses exactly how  it happened. Master Meadow Mouse knew that a wagon had borne Miss  Snooper up the road and over the hill. He had watched it disappear, with  his own eyes. All those things Moses Mouse repeated as fast as his  short breath would permit. He had hurried back home to tell the news as  soon as he had heard it. He found, however, that no one cared _how_ Miss  Kitty Cat (or Miss Snooper), went, nor where; no one cared who took her;  no one cared when. It was enough to know that she was gone. And  everybody exclaimed that it was the best news ever--and good riddance to  bad rubbish--meaning Miss Kitty Cat.    If it were only true! The Mouse family scarcely dared believe that it  was. But when two days passed, and Moses Mouse himself had even ventured  into the pantry, and the kitchen, and the woodshed, without meeting Miss  Kitty, the Mouse family dared decide that she had indeed gone for good.           *       *       *       *       *    Meanwhile Miss Kitty Cat was having a most unhappy time. It was true  that she had been stolen. A man driving a peddler's wagon up the hill  one evening had noticed her as she lay on top of the stone wall, around  the turn of the road beyond the farmhouse. \"Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!\" he  called, as he stopped his horse. And reaching behind the seat, he  brought out a bit of food, which he held out for her.    Now, it happened that at that very moment Miss Kitty Cat had her mind on  food. She had been hoping that a meal would appear at any moment out of  a chink in the wall. And when it was dangled right before her eyes like  that she couldn't resist it. She climbed up into the wagon. And the next  thing she knew the peddler had clapped her into a basket and fastened  the cover. Miss Kitty Cat was a prisoner.    \"There, my beauty!\" the peddler exclaimed. \"I'll take you home with me.  We need a mouser. And I dare say you're a good one. Unless I'm mistaken,  you were hunting chipmunks on the wall.\"    Miss Kitty Cat made no answer. Naturally, it pleased her to be called a  beauty. But there were other matters that she didn't like in the least.  Her captor had forgotten to toss the scrap of meat into the basket--the  bait with which he had caught her. And it was somewhat breathless inside  her prison. And Miss Kitty Cat had no idea where the peddler was taking  her.    He had clucked to his horse and started him plodding up the hill. Every  time a wheel struck a stone Miss Kitty gritted her teeth. She never did  enjoy riding in a wagon, anyhow. And this one was not at all  comfortable.    \"They'll wonder, back home, what's become of me,\" she thought. \"And one  thing is certain: everybody will miss me!\"          XIX    STRANGE QUARTERS      THE PEDDLER that took Miss Kitty Cat away in his cart drove long into  the night. Inside the basket into which her captor had popped her, Miss  Kitty kept her wits at work. She knew that there were many twists and  turns as they creaked up the hills and rattled down the other side of  them. Then there were level stretches where the peddler held his horse  to a swinging gait that fast put long miles between them and Farmer  Green's place in Pleasant Valley.    \"Dear me!\" Miss Kitty thought. \"What a tramp I'll have getting back  home again!\" For already she was planning to return to the farm. She  didn't care if they did need a good mouser at the stranger's house. They  needed one just as much at Farmer Green's.    \"If Mrs. Green has to depend on traps to take care of the mice she'll  soon be eaten out of house and home,\" Miss Kitty mused. \"The minute that  fat Moses Mouse knows I'm gone he'll be as bold as brass.\"    At last the wagon left the hard road and pulled up in a dooryard. A dog  barked. And Miss Kitty heard voices.    \"I've brought you something in here that you'll like,\" said the peddler  as he handed Miss Kitty's basket to somebody. \"But don't look at it out  of doors or it'll get away.\"    Later, inside the house, a woman let Miss Kitty out of her prison.    \"What a big cat!\" she exclaimed. \"Where did you get her?\"    \"Oh, I picked her up on the road,\" said the peddler. \"She looked as if  she wanted a ride,\" he chuckled. \"I think she was hunting along an old  stone wall.\"    \"She'll find hunting enough here,\" said his wife. \"This house is overrun  with mice. I'll just put her down cellar and let her work for her  supper.\" Then she gave Miss Kitty a toss down the cellar stairs and  slammed the door behind her.    It was no wonder that Miss Kitty Cat was angry.    \"A fine way to treat a guest!\" she spluttered down there in the dark.  \"That woman might have set out a little milk for me. It would have  tasted good, after my long ride in that stuffy basket.\" Miss Kitty  couldn't help thinking what a fine home she had had at Farmer Green's  and how good Mrs. Green had always been to her.    Even Johnnie Green--though he _was_ a boy--had petted her oftener than  he had pulled her tail.    But Miss Kitty was too hungry to sit long at the foot of the cellar  stairs in thought.    She soon heard faint rustlings squeaks, and scratchings around her. And  though she didn't care to"]]]
