He  had picked up a smattering of education in Prague. He had studied the  writings of Wycliffe and of Hus, and often appealed to Wycliffe in his  works. He could quote, when he liked, from the great Church Fathers. He  had a fair working knowledge of the Bible; and, above all, he had the  teaching of Christ and the Apostles engraved upon his conscience and his  heart. As he was not a priest, he could afford to be independent; as he  knew but little Latin, he wrote in Bohemian; and thus, like Stitny and  Hus before him, he appealed to the people in language they could all  understand. Of all the leaders of men in Bohemia, this Peter was the  most original and daring. As he pondered on the woes of his native land,  he came to the firm but sad conclusion that the whole system of religion  and politics was rotten to the core. Not one of the jangling sects was  in the right. Not one was true to the spirit of Christ. Not one was  free from the dark red stain of murder. His chief works were his Net  of Faith, his Reply to Nicholas of Pilgram, his Reply to Rockycana, his  Image of the Beast, his theological treatise On the Body of Christ,  his tract The Foundation of Worldly Laws, his devotional commentary,  Exposition of the Passion according to St. John, and, last, though not  least, his volume of discourses on the Gospel lessons for the year,  entitled Postillia. Of these works the most famous was his masterly Net  of Faith. He explained the title himself. \"Through His disciples,\" said  Peter, \"Christ caught the world in the net of His faith, but the bigger  fishes, breaking the net, escaped. Then others followed through these  same holes made by the big fishes, and the net was left almost empty.\"  His meaning was clear to all. The net was the true Church of Christ; the  two whales who broke it were the Emperor and the Pope; the big fishes  were the mighty \"learned persons, heretics and offenders\"; and the  little fishes were the true followers of Christ.    He opened his bold campaign in dramatic style. When John Ziska and  Nicholas of Husinec declared at Prague that the time had come for the  faithful to take up arms in their own defence, Peter was present at the  debate, and contended that for Christians war was a crime. {1419.}    \"What is war?\" he asked. \"It is a breach of the laws of God! All  soldiers are violent men, murderers, a godless mob!\"    He hated war like a Quaker, and soldiers like Tolstoy himself. He  regarded the terrible Hussite Wars as a disgrace to both sides. As the  fiery Ziska swept the land with his waggons, this Apostle of peace was  sick with horror. \"Where,\" he asked, in his Reply to Rockycana, \"has God  recalled His commands, 'Thou shalt not kill,' 'Thou shalt not steal,'  'Thou shalt not take thy neighbour's goods'? If God has not repealed  these commands, they ought still to be obeyed to-day in Prague and  Tabor. I have learned from Christ, and by Christ I stand; and if the  Apostle Peter himself were to come down from Heaven and say that it was  right for us to take up arms to defend the truth, I should not believe  him.\"    For Peter the teaching of Christ and the Apostles was enough. It was  supreme, final, perfect. If a king made a new law, he was spoiling  the teaching of Christ. If the Pope issued a bull, he was spoiling the  teaching of Christ. If a Council of Bishops drew up a decree, they were  spoiling the teaching of Christ. As God, said Peter, had revealed His  will to full perfection in Jesus Christ, there was no need for laws made  by men. \"Is the law of God sufficient, without worldly laws, to  guide and direct us in the path of the true Christian religion? With  trembling, I answer, it is. It was sufficient for Christ Himself, and it  was sufficient for His disciples.\" And, therefore, the duty of all  true Christians was as clear as the noon-day sun. He never said that  Christian people should break the law of the land. He admitted that  God might use the law for good purposes; and therefore, as Christ had  submitted to Pilate, so Christians must submit to Government. But there  their connection with Government must end. For heathens the State was  a necessary evil; for Christians it was an unclean thing, and the less  they had to do with it the better. They must never allow the State to  interfere in matters within the Church. They must never drag each other  before the law courts. They must never act as judges or magistrates.  They must never take any part whatever in municipal or national  government. They must never, if possible, live in a town at all. If  Christians, said Peter, lived in a town, and paid the usual rates and  taxes, they were simply helping to support a system which existed for  the protection of robbers. He regarded towns as the abodes of vice, and  citizens as rogues and knaves. The first town, he said, was built by the  murderer, Cain. He first murdered his brother Abel; he then gathered his  followers together; he then built a city, surrounded by walls; and thus,  by robbery and violence, he became a well-to-do man. And modern towns,  said Peter, were no whit better. At that time the citizens of some towns  in Bohemia enjoyed certain special rights and privileges; and this, to  Peter, seemed grossly unfair. He condemned those citizens as thieves.  \"They are,\" he said, \"the strength of Anti-Christ; they are adversaries  to Christ; they are an evil rabble; they are bold in wickedness; and  though they pretend to follow the truth, they will sit at tables with  wicked people and knavish followers of Judas.\" For true Christians,  therefore, there was only one course open. Instead of living in godless  towns, they should try to settle in country places, earn their living as  farmers or gardeners, and thus keep as clear of the State as possible.  They were not to try to support the law at all. If they did, they were  supporting a wicked thing, which never tried to make men better, but  only crushed them with cruel and useless punishments. They must never  try to make big profits in business. If they did, they were simply  robbing and cheating their neighbours. They must never take an oath, for  oaths were invented by the devil. They must never, in a word, have any  connection with that unchristian institution called the State.    And here Peter waxed vigorous and eloquent. He objected, like Wycliffe,  to the union of Church and State. Of all the bargains ever struck,  the most wicked, ruinous and pernicious was the bargain struck between  Church and State, when Constantine the Great first took the Christians  under the shadow of his wing. For three hundred years, said Peter,  the Church of Christ had remained true to her Master; and then this  disgusting heathen Emperor, who had not repented of a single sin, came  in with his vile \"Donation,\" and poisoned all the springs of her life.  If the Emperor, said Peter, wanted to be a Christian, he ought first to  have laid down his crown. He was a ravenous beast; he was a wolf in the  fold; he was a lion squatting at the table; and at that fatal moment in  history, when he gave his \"Donation\" to the Pope, an angel in heaven  had spoken the words: \"This day has poison entered the blood of the  Church.\"[4]  \"Since that time,\" said Peter, \"these two powers, Imperial and Papal,  have clung together. They have turned everything to account in Church  and in Christendom for their own impious purposes. Theologians,  professors, and priests are the satraps of the Emperor. They ask the  Emperor to protect them, so that they may sleep as long as possible, and  they create war so that they may have everything under their thumb.\"    If Peter lashed the Church with whips, he lashed her priests with  scorpions. He accused them of various vices. They were immoral; they  were superstitious; they were vain, ignorant and empty-headed; and,  instead of feeding the Church of God, they had almost starved her to  death. He loathed these \"honourable men, who sit in great houses, these  purple men, with their beautiful mantles, their high caps, their fat  stomachs.\" He accused them of fawning on the rich and despising the  poor. \"As for love of pleasure,\" he said, \"immorality, laziness,  greediness, uncharitableness and cruelty--as for these things, the  priests do not hold them as sins when committed by princes, nobles and  rich commoners. They do not tell them plainly, \"You will go to hell if  you live on the fat of the poor, and live a bestial life,\" although they  know that the rich are condemned to eternal death by such behaviour.  Oh, no! They prefer to give them a grand funeral. A crowd of priests,  clergy, and other folk make a long procession. The bells are rung. There  are masses, singings, candles and offerings. The virtues of the dead  man are proclaimed from the pulpit. They enter his soul in the books of  their cloisters and churches to be continually prayed for, and if what  they say be true, that soul cannot possibly perish, for he has been so  kind to the Church, and must, indeed, be well cared for.\"    He accused them, further, of laziness and gluttony. \"They pretend to  follow Christ,\" he said, \"and have plenty to eat every day. They have  fish, spices, brawn, herrings, figs, almonds, Greek wine and other  luxuries. They generally drink good wine and rich beer in large  quantities, and so they go to sleep. When they cannot get luxuries they  fill themselves with vulgar puddings till they nearly burst. And this is  the way the priests fast.\" He wrote in a similar strain of the mendicant  friars. He had no belief in their profession of poverty, and accused  them of gathering as much money as they could.

Fergusson has pointed out  that the roof of the octagon is the only Gothic dome in existence.  Beresford Hope[11] compares the octagonal lanterns of Milan and Antwerp  with that at Ely, which he calls unique in this country.    The building was begun as soon as the space was cleared. The stonework  was finished in 1328, little more than six years after the tower fell.  The woodwork of the vaulting and lantern took longer time; but this also  was quite complete in 1342. Walsingham had become prior in the previous  year. The weight of the lantern, it need hardly be said, is not borne,  though it looks like it from below, by the vaulting that we see. There  is a perfect forest of oak hidden from sight, the eight great angle  posts being no less than 3 feet 4 inches by 2 feet 8 inches in section.  There is also the leaden roof of the octagon (of that part which is  exclusive of the lantern), 18 feet above the vaulting, to be supported.  A glance at Plate 44 in Bentham's \"History\" gives some slight idea of  the method of construction.[12]    [Illustration: THE OCTAGON ABOUT 1825.                _From Wilds' English Cathedrals._]    With such a man as Walsingham on the spot we cannot be wrong in  assigning to him the authorship of all the architectural designs that  were carried out in his lifetime. It is believed--for the date is not  exactly known--that he died in 1364. Besides the lady-chapel and  octagon, he must have designed the singularly beautiful bays of the  presbytery between the octagon and Northwold's work. The exquisite way  in which the main characteristics of the Early English work are adapted  to the Decorated style demands our highest admiration. The arrangement  of the three western bays on each side is exactly like Northwold's work,  while the additional grace and beauty of ornamentation mark the advance  in taste that distinguished the Decorated period. Bishop Hotham  undertook the whole expense of rebuilding this portion of the cathedral.  He did not live to see it completed, as he died in 1337, but he left  money for the purpose. The total expense of this rebuilding is given at  L2034 12_s._ 8-1/4_d._, while the cost of the octagon and lantern amounted  to not very much more--L2406 6_s._ 11_d._ Nearly all this latter cost  was defrayed by the monastery, little more than L200 having been  contributed from external sources. These amounts must be multiplied by  twenty, if not twenty-five, to represent the present value. The  rebuilding of these three bays in the presbytery involved the rebuilding  of the corresponding portions of the aisles.    The domestic buildings were also improved, and some new ones erected by  Walsingham. \"The Sacrist's Office he almost new built, made several  additional apartments in it, and encompassed the whole with a strong  wall; in the North-west corner of which he built a square building of  stone, and covered it with lead; part of this he appropriated to the use  of Goldsmith's work, and for other purposes relative to his Office;  another Building taken notice of as built by him, was contiguous to the  Infirmary; it was of stone, covered with lead, and had convenient  offices under it, chiefly intended for the use of the _Custos_ of the  Infirmary. In his time also, Bells[13] were first put up in the great  Western Tower.\"[14] Of this period the following are enumerated as works  executed in the monastery[15]: Prior Crauden's chapel, the prior's new  hall above the old one, the guest hall, the fair hall, and the residence  of the sub-prior.    On the death of Bishop de Lisle in 1361, Walsingham was elected bishop  by the convent, but the election was set aside by the pope. This eminent  architect was buried in the cathedral, but the precise spot is not  known. The epitaph on his tomb has been preserved, and in it we find  that he was buried \"ante Chorum\" (in front of the choir). This would  mean the ritual choir as then existing, and would fix the place of his  interment approximately at the spot where there is now a large  monumental slab, from which the brass has been removed; and this has  always been traditionally said to be the actual stone placed over his  body. The brass represented an ecclesiastic with mitre and pastoral  staff. The objection to this having been Walsingham's memorial, that  these emblems could not have been correctly placed upon it, has been  thus met: \"On the other hand it is contended that although Alan died a  Prior of the Convent, he had been elected Bishop by the Monks, though  his election was overruled by the Pope, and that seeing to his successor  Prior Powcher the Pope gave permission that he and all future Priors of  Ely should wear the mitre and carry the crozier, it is possible that the  Monks had anticipated somewhat the Pope's edict, and had represented  their beloved Prelate with episcopal mitre on his head and crozier in  his hand.\"[16] He well deserved the description in the epitaph, \"Flos  operatorum\" (\"The Flower of Craftsmen\"). The rich woodwork in the  choir--the stalls with their beautiful canopies--is also certainly  Walsingham's work.    Besides the great operations of this century there were various  alterations and additions made in the cathedral of which the date is not  recorded. The triforium in the presbytery was rearranged; the external  walls were raised, and the Early English windows of Northwold's work  were replaced by much larger ones with Decorated tracery. As the  clerestory windows were not altered, the lean-to roof of the triforium  was of course made much more flat than before. The graceful flying  buttresses, with their elegant pinnacles, are of this same date. The  character of Northwold's triforium windows and the corbel table below  the parapet may be still seen in two bays on the south side. The aisle  windows of the presbytery were also enlarged in the Decorated period;  but they are not of the same design as the triforium windows, and they  were probably not inserted at the same time. Judging by ordinary methods  of discriminating dates by character and style, we should suppose the  aisle windows to be earlier than those above; possibly some of this was  done by Bishop Barnet (1366-1373). The whole designing is so unlike any  of Walsingham's known work that we can hardly suppose that he was the  author.    After the extensive changes of the fourteenth century were completed,  the fabric of the cathedral was left practically as we see it now.  Rearrangements of the interior have taken place on many occasions since,  and the numerous side-chapels have been despoiled of their altars; but  there has been no material structural change.    From the death of Bishop Barnet in 1373 to the suppression of the  monasteries no Bishop of Ely is credited with having done anything  towards the fabric of the cathedral except Bishop Gray (1454-1478). Some  of them were at variance with the prior and convent, and would be little  inclined to spend money on the church. Those that had a taste for  architecture displayed it in beautifying their palaces or manor-houses,  or upon buildings connected with the universities or other places in  which they had private interest. Some were men of great political  influence, and found their time and energies fully occupied in matters  of national importance. One at least spent immense sums upon the  drainage of the fens. Some did indeed erect chapels or shrines in the  cathedral, or left provision that they should be erected after their  deaths, but these were as memorials of themselves. The monastery carried  out whatever was done in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as long  as the monastery existed. The first such work was begun early in the  fifteenth century by Prior Powcher: this was the erection of the upper  portion of the western tower. At the top of the tower, before this  addition, there was a wooden spire covered with lead. The upper story  now is octagonal, and there are also octagonal turrets at the corners,  detached, except at top and bottom, from the main body. These were  clearly built so as to harmonise with the large projecting  turrets--massive enough themselves to be called towers--at the ends of  the west front. This octagon was also itself--but probably at a much  later date--surmounted with some sort of spire. An engraving dated 1786  shows this spire: it was no improvement to the tower. It was happily  removed early in the nineteenth century. This additional story was built  without due preparation. The extra weight was too much for the support  which had been sufficient for the smaller tower; accordingly casing was  added round the four great piers to increase the support. This was in  Bishop Gray's time, and he contributed largely towards the cost. \"The  Prior and Convent were at great charges in repairing the lower part of  the Western Tower; the Arches and Pillars of which, being found  insufficient for its support, were therefore obliged to be strengthened,  by wholly new-casing them with Stone, in the most substantial manner, as  we now see them.\"[17] It has been reasonably conjectured that this extra  weight was the cause of the ruin of the northern part of the west  transept, or that it was then damaged beyond repair. To Bishop Gray is  also assigned in particular the insertion of two windows in the north  aisle of the presbytery, near the place where he was afterwards buried.  The undoubted Decorated character of the upper stage of the west tower  marks it as belonging to the very earliest years of the century. There  is not the least tendency towards any features of the Perpendicular  style. Without reckoning tombs and chapels, there is no structural work  of distinct Perpendicular character to be seen at Ely Cathedral, except  some remains of the cloisters, and the windows in the nave aisles and  clerestory, and those in the upper parts of the great transept, and the  large"]]]
