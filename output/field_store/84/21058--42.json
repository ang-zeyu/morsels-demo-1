We  often hear watchmakers brag of the secrets they possess for hardening  pivot drills, but I fancy they would be somewhat surprised if they  traveled around a little, to find how many watchmakers harden their  drills in exactly the same way that they do. The great secret, so-called,  of making good drills, is to first secure good steel, and then use care  to see that you do not burn it in the subsequent operations. The fewer  times the steel is heated the better. My experience teaches me that you  can do no better than to select some nice pieces of Stubb's steel for  your pivot drills. Many watchmakers make their drills from sewing  needles, say No. 3 or 4, sharps. The steel in these needles is usually of  good quality, but the great drawback is that a drill made from a needle  will not resist any great pressure, and is liable to break just at the  time that you have arrived at the most important point. If your drill is  made from a piece of Stubb's steel wire, or an old French or Swiss  graver, you not only know that the material in it is first-class, but you  can leave the base of the drill solid and substantial, with enough metal  in it to resist considerable pressure. The part of the drill which  actually enters the pivot is very short, and the end can be turned down  to the desired diameter. Turn or reduce your wire by means of a pivot  file so as to be smooth and conical, as shown at _A_, Fig. 24. The  conical form is given to the drill for exactly the same reason that it is  given to the balance pivots, because it gives additional strength. Heat  to a very pale red for about one-half inch from the end, and then spread  the point, as shown at _B_, Fig. 24, by a slight blow of the hammer. We  are now ready to temper our drill, and we must exercise a little care  that the steel is not burnt and that the drill is not bent or warped when  hardening. The flame of the alcohol lamp should be reduced as small as  possible, or otherwise the steel may become overheated and lose all its  good qualities. If needles are used for making drills there is a great  liability of their warping when hardening, but when a larger piece of  wire is used there is not much danger, if care is exercised in  introducing the drill that it goes into the compound straight and point  foremost. If a needle is used, it is well to construct a shield for it,  to be used when heating and hardening. This shield can be made from a  small piece of metal tubing, broached out to fit loosely over the shank  and point of the drill. The drill is introduced into this shield as shown  in Fig. 25, and a little soap may be introduced into the end _a_ before  plunging. Various hardening devices are used, but in my experience  beeswax or sealing wax will be found as good as any. Heat the drill (or  if a needle, the drill and shield both), to a pale red and plunge  straight into the wax. In the latter case, where the shield is used, the  shield, on striking the wax, will run up the shank of the drill, allowing  the point to pierce the wax. Some watchmakers introduce the extreme point  of the drill into mercury first and then plunge into the wax. This  hardens the extreme point of the drill very hard, so hard, in fact, that  it will penetrate the hardest steel, but care must be exercised with such  a drill because the mercury makes it not only very hard but very brittle.  _C_, Fig. 24, shows a drill after it has been finished on the Arkansas  stone. This shape of drill will withstand the pressure necessary to drill  into hard steel. Many watchmakers reduce the temper of every staff before  drilling. This, I think, is quite unnecessary. There are very few cases  in which it is necessary to reduce the temper of the staff, and even then  it should only be reduced as far as it is to be drilled, and then not in  excess of a good spring temper.    [Illustration: _Fig. 24._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 25._]    The centering of a staff in wax has been thoroughly described and in  pivoting the proceeding is the same as in staffing. After accurately  centering your work, make a small cut in the center for the reception of  the drill and make this mark deep enough to take the entire cutting head  of the drill. Keep the drill firmly pressed into this center and kept wet  constantly with turpentine. Do not revolve the work all one way, but give  the lathe an alternating motion. At first give but a third or a half  revolution each way, until the drill begins to bite into the staff, when  you can then safely give it a full revolution each way. Care must be  exercised, however, not to give the work too rapid a motion, for if you  do the friction is apt to draw down the temper of your drill. Many  watchmakers find that their drills cut well for a certain distance and  then refuse to work altogether, and one of the chief reasons is that they  are in too great a hurry with their drilling.    If you find it absolutely necessary to reduce the hardness of your staff  before drilling, do so by drilling a hole in the end of a small piece of  copper wire that will just fit over the part to be softened, and apply  the heat to this copper wire, say one-fourth of an inch from the staff.  The heat will run down the copper wire and heat the staff just where you  wish to draw the temper. Be careful and do not draw the temper too much,  nor let it extend down the staff too far.    The plug for the new pivot should be carefully made, perfectly round,  with a very little taper, and should be draw-filed before being driven  in. Some workmen dip the plug in acid before driving in, as they declare  that the pivot is less liable to be loosened while turning, if so  treated. The acid simply rusts the pivot and the hole, but I cannot see  that this will hold it any more firmly in place while finishing. If the  taper is a gradual one and the pivot a good close fit, there will be  little danger of it loosening while dressing to shape. If too great a  taper is given to the plug, there is danger of splitting the end of the  staff, and this involves the making of an entire new staff.    The turning up of a new pivot does not differ in any way from the  instructions given for turning pivots on a new staff. With a little care  both in turning and finishing, a new pivot can be put in so nicely that  only the initiated can tell it, and then only with the aid of a strong  glass.    In pivoting cylinders there is some danger of breaking them. To avoid  this, select a piece of joint wire, the opening of which is slightly  larger than the diameter of the cylinder at the lower end, and cut off a  piece the length of the cylinder proper, leaving the pivot projecting.  Now fill the cylinder with lathe wax, and while the wax is warm, slip on  the joint wire. You can now proceed to true up the pivot in the usual  manner, and when the wax is quite cold, proceed to turn and polish the  pivot before removing from the lathe. If the joint wire is properly  cemented on the cylinder, it is almost impossible to break it. After all  the work is done, the wax can be dissolved in alcohol. In pivoting  pinions to cylinder escape-wheels and third wheels, it is not necessary  to remove the wheels, but great care should be used in handling. In the  latter case use plenty of wax. Do all your centering by the outside of  the pinion. Perfect centering and sharp tools are requisite to good  pivoting. Do not try to rush your work, especially while drilling.  Proceed deliberately with your work and aim to restore the watch to the  condition it was in originally, and you will find staffing and pivoting  is not half as hard as some workmen would have you believe.

The best  \"Songs From Vagabondia,\" I am told, are written in comfortable  apartments, where there are a bath and a Whitely Exerciser; but patient,  persistent effort and work overtime are necessary to lick the lines into  shape so they will live. Good poets run their machinery in double  shifts.    \"Go away!\" cried Bliss Carman, when he had opened the door in reply to  my sprightly knock. \"Go away! I am giving to airy nothings a local  habitation and a name. This is my busy night--do you not see?\" And fully  understanding the conditions, for I am a poet myself, I went away and  left the author to his labors.    It is a mistake to assume that genius is the capacity for evading hard  work. \"La Vie de Boheme\" is a beautiful myth that was first worked out  with consummate labor by a man of imagination named Murger, and told  again with variations by Balzac and Du Maurier. Boheme is not down on  the map, because it is not a money-order post-office. It is only a Queen  Mab fairy fabric of a warm, transient desire; its walls being  constructed of the stuff that dreams are made of, and its little life is  rounded with a pipe and tabor, two empties and a brass tray. Yet the  semblance of the thing is there and this often deceives the very elect.  Around every art studio are found the young men in velveteen who smoke  infinite cigarettes, and throw off opinions about this great man and  that, and prate prosaically in blase monotone of the Beautiful.  Sometimes these young persons give lectures on \"Art as I Have Found It\";  but do not be deceived by this--the art that lives is probably being  produced by small, shy, red-headed men who work on a top floor, and whom  you can only find with the help of a search-warrant. One sort talks of  art, the other kind produces it. One tells of truth, the other is  living it.    Edgar Allan Poe wrote the most gruesome stories that have ever been  told, just to prove that life is a tragedy and not worth living. But who  ever lived fuller and applied himself to hard work more conscientiously  in order to make his point? Poe wrote and rewrote, and changed and added  and interlined and balanced it all on his actor's tongue, and read it  aloud before the glass. Poe shortened his days and flung away a valuable  fag-end of his life, trying to show that life is not worth living, and  thus proved it is. Gray spent thirteen years writing his \"Elegy,\" and so  made clear the point that the man who does good work does not at the  last lay him down and rest his head upon the lap of earth, a youth to  fortune and to fame unknown. Gray secured both fame and fortune. He was  so successful that he declined the Laureateship, and had the felicity to  die of gout. Gray's immortality is based upon the fact that his life  gave the lie to his logic. The man who thinks out what he wants to do,  and then works and works hard, will win, and no others do, or ever have,  or can--God will not have it so.           *       *       *       *       *    As a violinist Paganini far surpassed all other players who ever lived;  and when one follows the story of his life, the fact is apparent that he  succeeded because he worked.    And yet behold the paradox! The idea existed in his own day, and is  abroad yet, that \"the devil guided his hand,\" for the thought that the  devil is more powerful than God has ever been held by the majority of  men--more especially if a fiddle is concerned.    Such patience, such persistency, such painstaking effort as the man put  forth for a score of years would have made him master at anything. The  public knows nothing of these long years of labor and preparation--it  sees only the result, and this result shows such consummate ease and  naturalness--all done without effort--that it exclaims, \"A genius--the  devil guides his hand!\" The remark was made of Titian and his wonderful  color effects, and then again of Rembrandt with his mysterious limpid  shadows--their competitors could not understand it! And so they disposed  of the subject by attributing it to a supernatural agency.    Things all men can do and explain are natural; things we can not explain  are \"supernatural.\" Progress consists in taking things out of the  supernatural pigeonhole and placing them in the natural. As soon as we  comprehend the supernatural, we are a bit surprised to find it is  perfectly natural.    But the limitations of great men are seen in that when they have  acquired the skill to do a difficult thing well, and the public cries,  \"Genius!\" why the genius humors the superstition and begins to allow the  impression to get out mysteriously that he \"never had a lesson in his  life.\"    Any man who caters to the public is to a great degree spoiled by the  public. Actors act off the stage as well as on, falling victims to their  trade: their lives are stained by pretense and affectation, just as the  dyer's hand is subdued to the medium in which it works. The man of  talent who is much before the public poses because his audience wishes  him to; one step more and the pose becomes natural--he can not divest  himself of it. Paganini by hard work became a consummate player; and  then so the dear public should receive its money's worth, he evolved  into a consummate poseur--but he was still the Artist.           *       *       *       *       *    A large number of writers have described the appearance and playing of  Niccolo Paganini, but none ever did the assignment with the creepy  vividness of Heinrich Heine. The rest of this chapter is Heine's. I make  the explanation because the passage is so well known that it would be  both indiscreet and inexpedient for me to bring my literary jimmy to  bear and claim it as my own--much as I would like to.    Says Heinrich Heine:         I believe that only one man has succeeded in putting Paganini's       true physiognomy upon paper--a deaf painter, Lyser by name, who, in       a frenzy full of genius, has with a few strokes of chalk so well       hit the great violinist's head that one is at the same time amused       and terrified at the truth of the drawing. \"The devil guided my       hand,\" the deaf painter said to me, chuckling mysteriously, and       nodding his head with a good-natured irony in the way he generally       accompanied his genial witticisms. This painter was, however, a       wonderful old fellow; in spite of his deafness he was       enthusiastically fond of music, and he knew how, when near enough       to the orchestra, to read the music in the musicians' faces, and to       judge the more or less skilful execution by the movements of their       fingers; indeed, he wrote critiques on the opera for an excellent       journal at Hamburg. And yet is that peculiarly wonderful? In the       visible symbols of the performance the deaf painter could see the       sounds. There are men to whom the sounds themselves are invisible       symbols in which they hear colors and forms.         I am sorry that I no longer possess Lyser's little drawing; it       would perhaps have given you an idea of Paganini's outward       appearance. Only with black and glaring strokes could those       mysterious features be seized, features which seemed to belong more       to the sulphurous kingdom of shades than to the sunny world of       life. \"Indeed, the devil guided my hand,\" the deaf painter assured       me, as we stood before the pavilion at Hamburg on the day when       Paganini gave his first concert there. \"Yes, my friend, it is true       that he has sold himself to the devil, body and soul, in order to       become the best violinist, to fiddle millions of money, and       principally to escape the damnable galley where he had already       languished many years. For, you see, my friend, when he was       chapel-master at Lucca he fell in love with a princess of the       theater, was jealous of some little abbate, was perhaps deceived by       the faithless amata, stabbed her in approved Italian fashion, came       in the galley to Genoa, and as I said, sold himself to the devil to       escape from it, became the best violin-player, and imposed upon us       this evening a contribution of two thalers each. But, you see, all       good spirits praise God! There in the avenue he comes himself, with       his suspicious impresario.\"         It was Paganini himself whom I then saw for the first time. He wore       a dark gray overcoat, which reached to his heels, and made his       figure seem very tall. His long black hair fell in neglected curls       on his shoulders, and formed a dark frame round the pale,       cadaverous face, on which sorrow, genius and hell had engraved       their lines. Near him danced along a little pleasing figure,       elegantly prosaic--with rosy, wrinkled face, bright gray little       coat with steel buttons, distributing greetings on all sides in an       insupportably friendly way, leering up, nevertheless, with       apprehensive air at the gloomy figure who walked earnest and       thoughtful at his side. It reminded one of Retzsch's presentation       of \"Faust\" and Wagner walking before the gates of Leipzig. The deaf       painter made comments to me in his mad way, and bade me observe       especially the broad, measured walk of Paganini. \"Does it not       seem,\" said he, \"as if he had the iron cross-pole still between his       legs? He has accustomed himself to that walk forever. See, too, in       what a contemptuous, ironical way he sometimes looks at his guide       when the latter wearies him with his prosaic questions. But he can       not separate himself from him; a bloody contract binds him to that       companion, who is no other than Satan. The ignorant multitude,       indeed, believe that this guide is the writer of"]]]
