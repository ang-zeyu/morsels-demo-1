Now, with an ordinary punch and a  hammer, each alternate tooth may be driven down until it rests flat on  the inclined face (A), so that it is impossible to set the teeth  wrongly. When you glance down the end of a properly set saw, you will  see a V-shaped channel, and if you will place a needle in the groove and  hold the saw at an angle, the needle will travel down without falling  out.    [Illustration: _Fig. 14. cross-cut._]    FILING.--The next step is the filing. Two things must be observed: the  pitch and the angle. By pitch is meant the inclination of the teeth.  Note the illustration (Fig. 13), which shows the teeth of a rip saw. You  will see at A that the pitch of the tooth is at right angles to the edge  of the saw. In Fig. 14, which shows the teeth of a cross-cut saw, the  pitch (B) is about 10 degrees off. The teeth of the rip saw are also  larger than those of the cross-cut.    THE ANGLE OF FILING.--By angle is meant the cutting position of the  file. In Fig. 12, the lines B represent the file disposed at an angle  of 12 degrees, not more, for a rip saw. For a cross-cut the angle of the  file may be less.    SAW CLAMPS.--You may easily make a pair of saw clamps as follows:    Take two pieces of hard wood, each three inches wide, seven-eighths of  an inch thick, and equal in length to the longest saw. Bevel one edge of  each as shown in A (Fig. 15), so as to leave an edge (B) about  one-eighth of an inch thick. At one end cut away the corner on the side  opposite the bevel, as shown at C, so the clamps will fit on the saw  around the saw handle.    [Illustration: _Fig. 15._]    When the saw is placed between these clamps and held together by the  jaws of the vise, you are ready for the filing operation. Observe the  following _filing suggestions_: Always hold the file horizontal or  level. In filing, use the whole length of the file. Do the work by a  slow, firm sweep.    Do not file all of the teeth along the saw at one operation, but only  the alternate teeth, so as to keep the file at the same angle, and thus  insure accuracy; then turn the saw and keep the file constantly at one  angle for the alternate set of teeth.    Give the same number of strokes, and exert the same pressure on the file  for each tooth, to insure uniformity. Learn also to make a free, easy  and straight movement back and forth with the file.    THE FILE.--In order to experiment with the filing motion, take two  blocks of wood, and try surfacing them off with a file. When you place  the two filed surfaces together after the first trial both will be  convex, because the hands, in filing, unless you exert the utmost  vigilance, will assume a crank-like movement. The filing test is so to  file the two blocks that they will fit tightly together without rolling  on each other. Before shaping and planing machines were invented,  machinists were compelled to plane down and accurately finish off  surfaces with a file.    In using the files on saws, however small the file may be, one hand  should hold the handle and the other hand the tip of the file.    A file brush should always be kept on hand, as it pays to preserve files  by cleaning them.    [Illustration: _Fig. 16._]    THE GRINDSTONE.--As most of the tools require a grindstone for  sharpening purposes, an illustration is given as a guide, with a diagram  to show the proper grinding angle. In Fig. 16 the upright (A) of the  frame serves as a line for the eye, so that if the point of the tool is  brought to the sight line, and the tool (C) held level, you will always  be able to maintain the correct angle. There is no objection to  providing a rest, for instance, like the cross bars (D, D), but the  artisan disdains such contrivances, and he usually avoids them for two  reasons: First, because habit enables him to hold the tool horizontally;  and, second, by holding the tool firmly in the hand he has better  control of it. There is only one thing which can be said in favor of a  rest, and that is, the stone may be kept truer circumferentially, as  all stones have soft spots or sides.    IN THE USE OF GRINDSTONES.--There are certain things to avoid and to  observe in the use of stones. Never use one spot on the stone, however  narrow the tool may be. Always move the tool from side to side. Never  grind a set of narrow tools successively. If you have chisels to grind  intersperse their grinding with plane bits, hatchet or other broad  cutting tools, so as to prevent the stone from having grooves therein.  Never use a tool on a stone unless you have water in the tray.    [Illustration: _Fig. 17. Correct manner of holding tool._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 18. Incorrect way of holding tool._]    CORRECT WAY TO HOLD TOOL FOR GRINDING.--There is a correct way to hold  each tool; see illustration (Fig. 17). The left hand should grasp the  tool firmly, near the sharp edge, as shown, and the right hand should  loosely hold the tool behind the left hand. There is a reason for this  which will be apparent after you grind a few tools. The firm grasp of  the left hand gives you absolute control of the blade, so it cannot  turn, and when inequalities appear in the grindstone, the rigid hold  will prevent the blade from turning, and thus enable you to correct the  inequalities of the stone. Bear in mind, the stone should be taken care  of just as much as the tools. An experienced workman is known by the  condition of his tools, and the grindstone is the best friend he has  among his tools.    INCORRECT WAY TO HOLD TOOL FOR GRINDING.--The incorrect way of holding a  tool is shown in Fig. 18. This, I presume, is the universal way in which  the novice takes the tool. It is wrong for the reason that the thumbs of  both hands are on top of the blade, and they serve as pivots on which  the tool may turn. The result is that the corners of the tool will dig  into the stone to a greater or less degree, particularly if it has a  narrow blade, like a chisel.    Try the experiment of grinding a quarter-inch chisel by holding it the  incorrect way; and then grasp it firmly with the left hand, and you will  at once see the difference.    The left hand serves both as a vise and as a fulcrum, whereas the right  hand controls the angle of the tool.    [Illustration: _Fig. 19._]    These remarks apply to all chisels, plane bits and tools of that  character, but it is obvious that a drawknife, which is always held by  the handles in grinding, and hatchets, axes and the like, cannot be held  in the same manner.    A too common error is to press the tool too hard on the stone. This is  wrong. Do not try to force the grinding.    Then, again, it is the practice of some to turn the stone away from the  tool. The stone should always move toward the tool, so as to prevent  forming a feather edge.    THE PLANE.--Indiscriminate use of planes should be avoided. Never use  the fore or smoothing planes on rough surfaces. The jack plane is the  proper tool for this work. On the other hand, the fore plane should  invariably be used for straightening the edges of boards, or for fine  surfacing purposes. As the jack plane has its bit ground with a curved  edge, it is admirably adapted for taking off the rough saw print  surface.    THE GAGE.--The illustration (Fig. 19) shows one of the most useful tools  in the kit. It is used to scribe the thickness of the material which is  to be dressed down, or for imprinting the edges of tenons and mortises.  Two should be provided in every kit, for convenience.    The scribing point should be sharpened with a file, the point being  filed to form a blade, which is at right angles to the bar, or parallel  with the movable cheekpiece.    CHISELS.--I have already pointed out, in general, how to hold tools for  grinding purposes, this description applying particularly to chisels,  but several additional things may be added.    Always be careful to grind the chisel so its cutting edge is square with  the side edge. This will be difficult at first, but you will see the  value of this as you use the tool. For instance, in making rebates for  hinges, or recesses and mortises for locks, the tool will invariably run  crooked, unless it is ground square.    The chisel should never be struck with a hammer or metal instrument, as  the metal pole or peon of the hammer will sliver the handle. The wooden  mallet should invariably be used.    GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.--If the workman will carefully observe the  foregoing requirements he will have taken the most important steps in  the knowledge of the art. If he permits himself to commence work without  having his tools in first-class condition, he is trying to do work under  circumstances where even a skilled workman is liable to fail.    Avoid making for yourself a lot of unnecessary work. The best artisans  are those who try to find out and know which is the best tool, or how to  make a tool for each requirement, but that tool, to be serviceable, must  be properly made, and that means it must be rightly sharpened.          CHAPTER III    HOW TO HOLD AND HANDLE TOOLS      Observation may form part of each boy's lesson, but when it comes to the  handling of tools, practice becomes the only available means of making a  workman. Fifty years of observation would never make an observer an  archer or a marksman, nor would it enable him to shoe a horse or to  build a table.    It sometimes happens that an apprentice will, with little observation,  seize a saw in the proper way, or hold a plane in the correct manner,  and, in time, the watchful boy will acquire fairly correct habits. But  why put in useless time and labor in order to gain that which a few  well-directed hints and examples will convey?    Tools are made and are used as short cuts toward a desired end.

[Illustration: Map showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40[deg]  N. at 9 o'clock, October first.]          CASSIOPEIA (kas-i-[=o]-p[=e]'-ya)--THE LADY IN THE CHAIR. (Face  North.)      LOCATION.--A line drawn from [d] Ursae Majoris, through Polaris,  strikes [a] Cassiopeiae. It is situated the same distance from Polaris  as Ursa Major, and about midway between Polaris and the zenith in the  Milky Way. Cassiopeia is characterized by a zigzag row of stars which  form a rude \"W,\" but in mid-autumn, to an observer facing north, the  \"W\" appears more like an \"M,\" and is almost overhead. Note the spot  marked 1572. This is where a very famous temporary star appeared in  that year. It was bright enough at one time to be seen in full  sunshine. The star [[^e]] is sixteen light years distant.    Caph is equidistant from the Pole, and exactly opposite the star  Megres in Ursa Major; with [a] Andromedae and [g] Pegasi it marks the  equinoctial colure. These stars are known as \"The Three Guides.\"    The chair can be readily traced out; [b], [a], and [g] mark three of  the four corners of the back, and [d] and [e], one of the front legs.  The word \"Bagdei,\" made up of the letters for the principal stars,  assists the memory.    The stars [g] and [b] are pointer stars to a fifth-magnitude star the  lucida of the asterism Lacerta, the lizard about 15[deg] from [b].    Cassiopeia makes an excellent illuminated clock. When [b] is above  Polaris it is noon, when it is in the west at right angles to its  first position it is 6 P.M. At midnight it is on the northern horizon,  and at 6 P.M. it is due east.    This is sidereal time which agrees with mean time on March 22d, and  gains on the latter at the rate of two hours a month.    [Illustration: CASSIOPEIA]          CEPHEUS (s[=e]'-f[=u]s) (Face North.)      LOCATION.--A line drawn from [a] to [b] Cassiopeiae and prolonged about  18[deg] strikes [a] Cephei. The nearest bright star west of Polaris is [g]  Cephei. Cepheus is an inconspicuous constellation, lying partly in the  Milky Way. A view of this constellation through an opera-glass will  repay the observer. Cepheus is characterized by a rude square, one  side of which is the base of an isosceles triangle. Look for the  so-called garnet star [m], probably the reddest star visible to the  naked eye in the United States. The star [z] has a blue companion  star.    [a] forms an equilateral triangle with Polaris and [e] Cassiopeiae.    It is claimed that Cepheus was known to the Chaldaeans twenty-three  centuries before our era.    Surrounding [d], [e], [z], and [l], which mark the king's head, is a  vacant space in the Milky Way, similar to the Coal Sack of Cygnus.    About 4[deg] from [g], in the direction of [k] is a pretty pair of  sixth-magnitude stars.    Owing to precession, [g], [b], and [a] Cephei will be successively the  Pole Star in 4500, 6000, and 7500 A.D. respectively.    [d] is a double whose components are yellow and blue. It is an  interesting variable changing from magnitude 3.7 to 4.9 at intervals  of 5 days 8 hours 47 minutes. As it is three times as bright at  maximum as at minimum and can be observed with the naked eye its  variations are well worth observing.    [Illustration: CEPHEUS]          PEGASUS (peg'-a-sus)--THE WINGED HORSE. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--One corner of the Great Square is found by drawing a line  from Polaris to Cassiopeia, and prolonging it an equal distance.    The Great Square is a stellar landmark. Three of the corners of the  square are marked by stars in Pegasus; the fourth, and northeastern,  corner is marked by the star Alpheratz in Andromeda. Each side of the  square is about 18[deg] long.    The horse is generally seen upside down, with his fore feet projected  up into the sky. Only the head, neck, and fore feet are represented.  The star Enif marks the nose.    [p] is an interesting double, easily seen in an opera-glass. All the  stars of the Square are approaching us at an inconceivable speed.    The position of the asterism Equus or Equ[=u]leus, the Little Horse,  or Horse's Head, is shown in the diagram.    Delphinus, the water jar of Aquarius, and the circlet in the Western  Fish, are all in the vicinity of Pegasus, and indicated in the  diagram.    The winged horse is found on coins of Corinth 500 to 430 B.C. The  Greeks called this constellation [Greek: hippos].    Pegasus seems to have been regarded in Phoenicia and Egypt as the sky  emblem of a ship.    Within the area of the Square Argelander counted thirty naked-eye  stars.    Note a fine pair in Equ[=u]leus just west of the star Enif in Pegasus.    The position of the equinoctial colure is defined by a line connecting  Polaris, [b] Cassiopeiae, [a] Andromedae, and [g] Pegasi.    [Illustration: PEGASUS]          ANDROMEDA (an-drom'-e-d[:a])--THE CHAINED LADY.      LOCATION.--The star [a] Alpheratz is at the northeastern corner of the  great square of Pegasus, one of the stellar landmarks.    Running east from [a], at almost equal distances, are four other  stars, two of which are of the second magnitude. The most easterly one  is [b] Persei, known as Algol, the famous variable. Lines connecting  the stars [g] Andromedae, Algol, and [a] Persei form a right-angled  triangle. The right angle is marked by Algol.    The chief object of interest in this constellation is the great  nebula, the first to be discovered. It can be seen by the naked eye  and it is a fine sight in an opera-glass. Its location is indicated in  the diagram.    The star [g] is the radiant point of the Bielid meteors, looked for in  November. It is a colored double visible in a 3\" glass.    The great nebula has been called the \"Queen of the Nebulae.\" It is said  to have been known as far back as A.D. 905, and it was described 986  A.D. as the \"Little Cloud.\"    Andromeda is very favorable for observation in September, low in the  eastern sky.    Note the characteristic \"Y\" shaped asterism known as Gloria Frederika  or Frederik's Glory. It lies about at the apex of a nearly isosceles  triangle of which a line connecting Alpheratz and [b] Pegasi is the  base. A line drawn from [d] to [a] Cassiopeiae and prolonged a little  over twice its length points it out.    [Illustration: ANDROMEDA]          PERSEUS (per'-s[=u]s)--THE CHAMPION. (Face Northeast.)      LOCATION.--[a] Persei lies on a line drawn from [b] to [g] Andromedae,  and is about 9[deg] from the latter. The most striking feature in Perseus  is the so-called \"segment of Perseus,\" a curve of stars "]]]
