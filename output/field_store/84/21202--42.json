[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22832"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Canterbury [2nd ed.] (#6)"],[1,"the whole was seen to be extinguished.  At four o'clock the authorities held the evening service, so as not to  break a continuity of custom extending over centuries; and in the  smoke-filled choir, the whole of the Chapter in residence, in the proper  Psalm (xviii.), found expression for the sense of victory over a conquered  enemy.\"    Thus little harm was done, but it must have been an exciting crisis while  it lasted. \"The bosses [of the vaulting], pierced with cradle-holes,  happened to be well-placed for the passage of the liquid lead dripping on  the back of the vault from the blazing roof,\" which poured down on to the  pavement below, on the very spot which Becket's shrine had once occupied.  \"Through the holes further westward water came, sufficient to float over  the surfaces of the polished Purbeck marble floor and the steps of the  altar, and alarmed the well-intentioned assistants into removing the  altar, tearing up the altar-rails, etc., etc. The relics of the Black  Prince, attached to a beam (over his tomb) at the level of the caps of the  piers on the south side of Trinity Chapel, were all taken down and placed  away in safety. The eastern end of the church is said to have been filled  with steam from water rushing through with, and falling on, the molten  lead on the floor; and, in time, by every opening, wood-smoke reached the  inside of the building, filling all down to the west of the nave with a  blue haze.\" The scene in the building is said to have been one of  extraordinary beauty, but most lovers of architecture would probably  prefer to view the fabric with its own loveliness, unenhanced by numerous  streams of molten lead pouring down from the roof.    Since that date Canterbury Cathedral has been happy in the possession of  no history, and we pass on, therefore, to the examination in detail of its  exterior.    [Illustration: THE CLOISTERS.]          CHAPTER II.    EXTERIOR AND PRECINCTS--THE MONASTERY.      The external beauties of Canterbury Cathedral can best be viewed in their  entirety from a distance. The old town has nestled in close under the  walls of the church that dominates it, preventing anything like a complete  view of the building from the immediate precincts. But Canterbury is girt  with a ring of hills, from which we may enjoy a strikingly beautiful view  of the ancient city, lying asleep in the rich, peaceful valley of the  Stour, and the mighty cathedral towering over the red-tiled roofs of the  town, and looking, as a rustic remarked as he gazed down upon it \"like a  hen brooding over her chickens.\" Erasmus must have been struck by some  such aspect of the cathedral, for he says, \"It rears its crest (_erigit  se_) with so great majesty to the sky, that it inspires a feeling of awe  even in those who look at it from afar.\" Such a view may well be got from  the hills of Harbledown, a village about two miles from Canterbury,  containing in itself many objects of antiquarian and aesthetic interest.  It stands on the road by which Chaucer's pilgrims wended their way to the  shrine of St. Thomas, and it is almost certainly referred to in the lines  in which the poet speaks of                             \"A little town      Which that yeleped is Bob Up and Down      Under the Blee in Canterbury way.\"    The name Harbledown is derived by local philologists from Bob up and Down,  and the hilly nature of the country fully justifies the title. Here stands  Lanfranc's Lazar-house, \"so picturesque even now in its decay, and in  spite of modern alterations which have swept away all but the ivy-clad  chapel of Lanfranc.\" In this hospital a shoe of St. Thomas was preserved  which pilgrims were expected to kiss as they passed by; and in an old  chest the modern visitor may still behold a rude money-box with a slit in  the lid, into which the great Erasmus is said to have dropped a coin when  he visited Canterbury at the time when St. Thomas's glory was just  beginning to wane. Behind the hospital is an ancient well called \"the  Black Prince's Well.\" The Black Prince, as is well known, passed through  Canterbury on his way from Sandwich to London, whither he was escorting  his royal prisoner, King John of France, whom he had captured at the  battle of Poitiers, A.D. 1357. We need not doubt that he halted at  Harbledown to salute the martyr's shoe, and he may have washed in the  water of the well, which was henceforward called by his name. Another  tradition relates that he had water brought to him from this well when  he lay sick, ten years later, in the archbishop's palace at Canterbury.    [Illustration: VIEW ON THE STOUR.]    Another good view may be had from the crest on which stands St. Martin's  Church, which was formerly believed to be the oldest in England, so  ancient that its origin was connected with the mythical King Lucius.  Modern research has decided that it is of later date, but there is no  doubt that on the spot on which it now stands, Bertha, the wife of  Ethelbert--who was ruling when Augustine landed with his monks--had a  little chapel, as Bede relates, \"in the east of the city,\" where she  worshipped, before her husband's conversion, with her chaplain, Luidhard,  a French priest. Dean Stanley has described this view in a fine passage:    \"Let any one sit on the hill of the little church of St. Martin, and look  on the view which is there spread before his eyes. Immediately below are  the towers of the great abbey of St. Augustine, where Christian learning  and civilization first struck root in the Anglo-Saxon race; and within  which, now, after a lapse of many centuries, a new institution has arisen,  intended to carry far and wide to countries of which Gregory and Augustine  never heard, the blessings which they gave to us. Carry your view on--and  there rises high above all the magnificent pile of our cathedral, equal in  splendour and state to any, the noblest temple or church, that Augustine  could have seen in ancient Rome, rising on the very ground which derives  its consecration from him. And still more than the grandeur of the outward  building that rose from the little church of Augustine, and the little  palace of Ethelbert, have been the institutions of all kinds, of which  these were the earliest cradle. From the first English Christian  city--from Kent, the first English Christian kingdom--has, by degrees,  arisen the whole constitution of Church and State in England which now  binds together the whole British Empire. And from the Christianity here  established in England has flowed, by direct consequence, first, the  Christianity of Germany--then after a long interval, of North America, and  lastly, we may trust in time, of all India and all Australasia. The view  from St. Martin's Church is, indeed, one of the most inspiriting that can  be found in the world; there is none to which I would more willingly take  any one who doubted whether a small beginning could lead to a great and  lasting good--none which carries us more vividly back into the past, or  more hopefully forward to the future.\"    In the town itself, the best point of vantage from which the visitor can  get a good view of the cathedral is the summit of the Dane John, a lofty  mound crowned by an obelisk; from this height we look across at the roof  and towers of the cathedral rising above thickly clustering trees: from  here also there is a fine view over the beautiful valley of the Stour in  the direction of Thanington and Chartham.    In the immediate precincts, a delightful picture is presented from the  Green Court, which was once the main outer court of the monastery. Here  are noble trees and beautifully kept turf, at once in perfect harmony and  agreeable contrast with the rugged walls of the weather-beaten cathedral:  the quiet soft colouring of the ancient buildings and that look of  cloistered seclusion only to be found in the peaceful nooks of cathedral  cities are seen here at their very best.    [Illustration: \"BELL HARRY,\" THE CENTRAL TOWER.]    The chief glory of the exterior of Canterbury Cathedral is the central  #Angel or Bell Tower#. This is one of the most perfect structures that  Gothic architecture, inspired by the loftiest purpose that ever stimulated  the work of any art, has produced. It was completed by Prior Selling, who  held office in 1472, and has been variously called the Bell Harry Tower  from the mighty Dunstan bell, weighing three tons and three hundredweight,  and the Angel Tower from the gilded figure of an angel poised on one of  the pinnacles, which has long ago disappeared. The tower itself is of two  stages, with two two-light windows in each stage; the windows are  transomed in each face, and the lower tier is canopied; each angle is  rounded off with an octagonal turret and the whole structure is a  marvellous example of architectural harmony, and in every way a work of  transcendent beauty. The two buttressing arches and the ornamental braces  which support it were added at the end of the fifteenth century by Prior  Goldstone, to whom the building of the whole tower is apparently  attributed in the following quaint passage from a mediaeval authority: \"He  by the influence and help of those honourable men, Cardinal John Morton  and Prior William Sellyng, erected and magnificently completed that lofty  tower commonly called Angyll Stepyll in the midst of the church, between  the choir and the nave--vaulted with a most beautiful vault, and with  excellent and artistic workmanship in every part sculptured and gilt, with  ample windows glazed and ironed. He also with great care and industry  annexed to the columns which support the same tower two arches or  vaults of stone work, curiously carved, and four smaller ones, to assist  in sustaining the said tower\" (\"Ang. Sac.\" i. 147, translated by Professor  Willis). The western front of the cathedral is flanked by two towers of  great beauty; a point in which Mediaeval architecture has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#6)"],[1,"three of the big  Terrors?    Her nose, her memory, and her instinct of direction inclined her to get  on the track again; but the place was infested with those  Thunder-rollers, and prudence led her to turn aside and follow the  river-bank with its musky home-reminders; and thus she was spared the  unspeakable horrors of the tunnel.    She was over three days learning the manifold dangers and complexities  of the East River docks. Once she got by mistake on a ferryboat and was  carried over to Long Island; but she took an early boat back. At length  on the third night she reached familiar ground, the place she had  passed the night of her first escape. From that her course was sure and  rapid. She knew just where she was going and how to get there. She knew  even the more prominent features in the Dog-scape now. She went faster,  felt happier. In a little while surely she would be curled up in her  native Orient--the old junk-yard. Another turn, and the block was in  sight.    But--what! It was gone! Kitty couldn't believe her eyes; but she must,  for the sun was not yet up. There where once had stood or leaned or  slouched or straggled the houses of the block, was a great broken  wilderness of stone, lumber, and holes in the ground.    Kitty walked all around it. She knew by the bearings and by the local  color of the pavement that she was in her home, that there had lived  the bird-man, and there was the old junk-yard; but all were gone,  completely gone, taking their familiar odors with them, and Pussy  turned sick at heart in the utter hopelessness of the case. Her  place-love was her master-mood. She had given up all to come to a home  that no longer existed, and for once her sturdy little heart was cast  down. She wandered over the silent heaps of rubbish and found neither  consolation nor eatables. The ruin had taken in several of the blocks  and reached back from the water. It was not a fire; Kitty had seen one  of those things. This looked more like the work of a flock of the  Red-eyed Monsters. Pussy knew nothing of the great bridge that was to  rise from this very spot.    When the sun came up she sought for cover. An adjoining block still  stood with little change, and the Royal Analostan retired to that. She  knew some of its trails; but once there, was unpleasantly surprised to  find the place swarming with Cats that, like herself, were driven from  their old grounds, and when the garbage-cans came out there were  several Slummers at each. It meant a famine in the land, and Pussy,  after standing it a few days, was reduced to seeking her other home on  Fifth Avenue. She got there to find it shut up and deserted. She waited  about for a day; had an unpleasant experience with a big man in a blue  coat, and next night returned to the crowded slum.    September and October wore away. Many of the Cats died of starvation or  were too weak to escape their natural enemies. But Kitty, young and  strong, still lived.    Great changes had come over the ruined blocks. Though silent on the  night when she first saw them, they were crowded with noisy workmen all  day. A tall building, well advanced on her arrival, was completed at  the end of October, and Slum Kitty, driven by hunger, went sneaking up  to a pail that a negro had set outside. The pail, unfortunately, was  not for garbage; it was a new thing in that region: a scrubbing-pail. A  sad disappointment, but it had a sense of comfort--there were traces of  a familiar touch on the handle. While she was studying it, the negro  elevator-boy came out again. In spite of his blue clothes, his odorous  person confirmed the good impression of the handle. Kitty had retreated  across the street. He gazed at her.    \"Sho ef dat don't look like de Royal Ankalostan! Hyar, Pussy, Pussy,  Pu-s-s-s-s-y! Co-o-o-o-m-e, Pu-u-s-s-sy, hyar! I 'spec's she's sho  hungry.\"    Hungry! She hadn't  had a real meal for months. The negro went into the  building and reappeared with a portion of his own lunch.    \"Hyar, Pussy, Puss, Puss, Puss!\" It seemed very good, but Pussy had her  doubts of the man. At length he laid the meat on the pavement, and went  back to the door. Slum Kitty came forward very warily; sniffed at the  meat, seized it, and fled like a little Tigress to eat her prize in  peace.          LIFE IV    XI    This was the beginning of a new era. Pussy came to the door of the  building now whenever pinched by hunger, and the good feeling for the  negro grew. She had never understood that man before. He had always  seemed hostile. Now he was her friend, the only one she had.    One week she had a streak of luck. Seven good meals on seven successive  days; and right on the top of the last meal she found a juicy dead Rat,  the genuine thing, a perfect windfall. She had never killed a  full-grown Rat in all her lives, but seized the prize and ran off to  hide it for future use. She was crossing the street in front of the new  building when an old enemy appeared,--the Wharf Dog,--and Kitty  retreated, naturally enough, to the door where she had a friend. Just  as she neared it, he opened the door for a well-dressed man to come  out, and both saw the Cat with her prize.    \"Hello! Look at that for a Cat!\"    \"Yes, sah,\" answered the negro. \"Dat's ma Cat, sah; she's a terror on  Rats, sah! hez 'em about cleaned up, sah; dat's why she's so thin.\"    \"Well, don't let her starve,\" said the man with the air of the  landlord. \"Can't you feed her?    \"De liver meat-man comes reg'lar, sah; quatah dollar a week, sah,\" said  the negro, fully realizing that he was entitled to the extra fifteen  cents for \"the idea.\"    \"That's all right. I'll stand it.\"      XII    \"M-e-a-t! M-e-a-t!\" is heard the magnetic, cat-conjuring cry of the old  liver-man, as his barrow is pushed up the glorified Scrimper's Alley,  and Cats come crowding, as of yore, to receive their due.    There are Cats black, white, yellow, and gray to be remembered, and,  above all, there are owners to be remembered. As the barrow rounds the  corner near the new building it makes a newly scheduled stop.    \"Hyar, you, get out o' the road, you common trash,\" cries the  liver-man, and he waves his wand to make way for the little gray Cat  with blue eyes and white nose. She receives an unusually large portion,  for Sam is wisely dividing the returns evenly; and Slum Kitty retreats  with her 'daily' into shelter of the great building, to which she is  regularly attached. She has entered into her fourth life with prospects  of happiness never before dreamed of. Everything was against her at  first; now everything seems to be coming her way. It is very doubtful  that her mind was broadened by travel, but she knew what she wanted and  she got it. She has achieved her long-time great ambition by catching,  not a Sparrow, but two of them, while they were clinched in mortal  combat in the gutter.    There is no reason to suppose that she ever caught another Rat; but the  negro secures a dead one when he can, for purposes of exhibition, lest  her pension be imperilled. The dead one is left in the hall till the  proprietor comes; then it is apologetically swept away. \"Well, drat dat  Cat, sah; dat Royal Ankalostan blood, sah, is terrors on Rats.\"    She has had several broods since. The negro thinks the Yellow Tom is  the father of some of them, and no doubt the negro is right.    He has sold her a number of times with a perfectly clear conscience,  knowing quite well that it is only a question of a few days before the  Royal Analostan comes back again. Doubtless he is saving the money for  some honorable ambition. She has learned to tolerate the elevator, and  even to ride up and down on it. The negro stoutly maintains that once,  when she heard the meat-man, while she was on the top floor, she  managed to press the button that called the elevator to take her down.    She is sleek and beautiful again. She is not only one of the four  hundred that form the inner circle about the liver-barrow, but she is  recognized as the star pensioner among them. The liver-man is  positively respectful. Not even the cream-and-chicken fed Cat of the  pawn-broker's wife has such a position as the Royal Analostan. But in  spite of her prosperity, her social position, her royal name and fake  pedigree, the greatest pleasure of her life is to slip out and go  a-slumming in the gloaming, for now, as in her previous lives, she is  at heart, and likely to be, nothing but a dirty little Slum Cat.          ARNAUX    THE CHRONICLE OF A HOMING PIGEON    We passed through the side door of a big stable on West Nineteenth  Street. The mild smell of the well-kept stalls was lost in the sweet  odor of hay, as we mounted a ladder and entered the long garret. The  south end was walled off, and the familiar \"Coo-oo, cooooo-oo,  ruk-at-a-coo,\" varied with the \"whirr, whirr, whirr\" of wings, informed  us that we were at the  pigeon-loft.    This was the home of a famous lot of birds, and to-day there was to be  a race among fifty of the youngsters. The owner of the loft had asked  me, as an unprejudiced outsider, to be judge in the contest.    It was a training race of the young birds. They had been taken out for  short distances with their parents once or twice, then set free to  return to the loft. Now for the first time they were to be flown  without the old ones. The point of start, Elizabeth, N. J., was a long  journey for their first unaided attempt. \"But then,\" the trainer  remarked, \"that's how we weed out the fools; only the best birds make  it, and that's all we want back.\"    There was another side to the flight. It was to be a race among those  that did return. Each of the men about the loft as well as several  neighboring fanciers were interested in one or other of the Homers.  They made up a purse for the winner, and on me was to devolve the  important duty of deciding which should take the stakes. Not the first  bird back, but the first bird into"]]]
