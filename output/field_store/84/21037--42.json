Superstition has prevailed in every generation and country in the  world. There are people who think that even Adam and Eve were tainted  with this hateful delusion, and that their offspring of the second  generation entertained opinions opposed to true religion. That man,  soon after the Creation, became acquainted with and yielded to the  doctrine of devils, scarcely admits of doubt. Those who conversed with  our first parents must have learned from them the circumstances  connected with the temptation, fall, and expulsion from the Garden of  Eden. It is not unreasonable, then, to suppose that the serpent was  looked upon at an early period as something more than an ordinary  earthly reptile. One can imagine Adam and Eve, when wandering in  perplexity and fear, after their first great sin, starting at the  sight of a serpent,--not being certain whether they beheld a reptile  of flesh merely, or looked upon their old enemy that had betrayed them  in their days of innocency. If they looked with suspicion on the  serpent, it is natural to suppose that their children would learn to  view this creeping animal as a creature endowed with supernatural  powers, by which it could bring about evil, and perhaps good.    Cain, there is reason to conclude, departed from the true worship of  the Most High before his offering was refused, and ere he dipped his  hands in his brother's blood. In Genesis iv. 26 there is an  implication that man had forsaken the right and holy religion prior to  the days of Seth. There is an opinion that men soon began to worship  the sun, moon, and stars, and that subsequently they paid homage to  objects which contributed to their preservation and to things that  might do them injury. The wandering Jew, Benjamin, one of the greatest  travellers in the East, gives an interesting account of solar worship  in early times. The posterity of Cush, he tells us, were addicted to  the contemplation of the stars, and worshipped the sun as a god. Their  towns were filled with altars dedicated to this orb. At early morn the  people rose, and ran out of the cities to await the rising sun, to  which on every altar there was a consecrated image, not in the  likeness of a man, but after the fashion of the solar orb, formed by  magic art. These artificial orbs, as soon as the sun rose, took fire,  and resounded with a great noise, to the joy of the deluded devotees.    Many Jewish doctors have condescended upon the precise time when man  began to commit idolatry, and they name Enos as the first  star-worshipper. Arabian divines tell a story of Abraham being brought  up in a dark cave, and at his first coming forth he was so much struck  with the appearance of the sun, moon, and stars, that he worshipped  them; and there are people who imagine that in the Book of Job they  discover evidence of the heavenly host being adored in the time of the  old patriarch of Uz.    Some suppose that all the gods of antiquity were Egyptian kings,  others that they were Thessalian princes, others that they were Jewish  patriarchs; while not a few are of opinion that they were kings of the  several countries where they were worshipped. It has been supposed  that Saturn represented Adam; Rhea, Eve; Jupiter, Cain; Prometheus,  Abel; Apollo, Lamech; Mercury, Jabal; Bacchus, Noah; and Phaeton,  Elias. Others imagine that Saturn came in place of Noah; Pluto, of  Sem; Neptune, of Japheth; Bacchus, of Nimrod; and Apollo, of Phut. A  third class of thinkers maintain that all the heathen gods centre in  Moses, and the goddesses in Zipporah his wife, or in Miriam his  sister. A fourth class hold that Saturn was Abraham; Rhea, Sarah;  Ceres, Keturah; Pallas, Hagar; Jupiter, Isaac; Juno, Rebecca; Pluto,  Ishmael; Typhon, Jacob; and Venus, Rachel. Such are examples of  imaginary resemblances between real and fictitious persons or gods  that never had any existence except in the minds of fanatical  romancers and a deluded people, whose faith was kept alive by  deception and artifice.    It was an early belief that ether, air, land, and water were full of  living spirits; and people believed, soon after man was created, that  the souls of just men, subsequent to death, had part of the universe  committed to them. This opinion being once established, assistance was  sought from the spirits of departed men and women, and efforts were  made in various ways to secure their favour. In course of time altars  were set up, temples consecrated, and sometimes victims offered to  obtain favour from spirits and false gods. Some rabbis affirmed that  the angel Raziel was Adam's master, and taught him the Cabbala; and  that Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Elias, etc. had each  his guardian angel, who directed his thoughts and actions. Jewish  doctors assign to magic great antiquity; they assert that it was known  to those who lived before the Flood. There is a tradition that one of  the causes of the Flood was the intercourse men had with demons.  Though it has been stated by ancient historians that Abraham was given  to magic, and that he taught it to his children, Josephus (obviously  overlooking what had been written prior to his time, and forgetting  what Moses had seen performed by the Egyptian priests before Pharaoh)  thinks Solomon was the first who practised this art. The Jewish  historian gives credit to the \"wisest man\" for inventing and  transmitting to posterity certain incantations for the cure of  diseases, and for the expulsion of evil spirits from the bodies of  those possessed with such demons. According to Josephus, the expulsion  was brought about by the use of a certain root sealed up in a wrapper,  and held under the afflicted person's nose while the name of Solomon  and words prescribed by him were pronounced. The learned historian  does not seem to doubt the wonderful power of Solomon, but rather  advances statements corroborative of what he had heard, for he asserts  that he himself was an eye-witness to a like cure effected, by equally  mysterious means, on a person named Eleazar in presence of the Emperor  Vespasian. Descendants of Abraham believed that their great ancestor  wore round his neck a precious stone, the sight of which cured every  kind of disease.    Suppose we set aside these assertions as fables, we cannot deny that  the Jews were at an early period addicted to magical arts. This  propensity, there can be no doubt, whenever first manifested, was  increased through the Hebrews' intercourse with the inhabitants of  Egypt, Syria, and Chaldea.    Jews, who professed to work wonders by enchantments, gave directions  how to select and combine passages and proper names of Scripture that  would render supernatural beings visible, and bring about many  surprising results. The sacred word Jehovah, they said, when read with  points, multiplied by or added to a given number of letters, and  composed into certain words, produced miraculous effects. By that  sacred name and strange arrangements, their prophets, they thought,  performed miracles. The devil was supposed to have the power of  accusing mortal man at the great day of propitiation, so the Jews  endeavoured to appease him with presents. They believed that on that  day only he had the power to bring a charge against them, and  therefore, to deceive him, they had recourse to a singular stratagem.  In reading the accustomed portion of the law, they left out the  beginning and the end,--an omission which was expected to cause Satan  to overlook the important time. Those versed in magic could tell that  the five Hebrew letters of which the devil's name was composed  constituted the number 364, during which number of days he could not  accuse them; and in some way or other unknown to us, in addition to  the plan of mutilating the law, they kept his mouth shut year after  year.    We find from the Holy Scriptures, that a witch was not permitted to  live,--that there should not be found among the Hebrews any that used  divination, an enchanter, a charmer, a consulter with familiar  spirits, nor a necromancer, because the abominations of these  mischievous people proved a snare to the nations that were driven out  before the Israelites. Various opinions have been expressed regarding  the witch of Endor. Parties are not agreed as to whether she did or  did not bring up Samuel before Saul; but into their disputes it is  unnecessary for us to enter. All that we mean to draw from the  narrative is, that if the King of Israel had recourse to a witch in  his hour of perplexity, superstition must have been general in the  nation.    Religiously disposed Jews wore upon their arms and foreheads two  pieces of parchment containing the ten commandments. These charms, or  emblems of sanctity, or whatever they were called, were not allowed to  be worn by women or by men when they went to a funeral or approached a  dead body.    The Jews confessed their sins to their rabbis, and the penance or  punishment was commensurate with their guilt. It was not uncommon for  Jewish devotees to lash themselves, but the number of stripes did not  at any time exceed thirty-nine. During the flagellation the penitent  lay on the ground with his head to the north and his feet to the  south, and it would have been considered profane to look to the east  or west while the chastisement was being inflicted. A Jew would as  soon have eaten swine's flesh as look to the east or west while he was  in a bath. Offenders were sometimes cursed in addition to their other  punishments; hence, it is presumed, the more modern recourse to curses  or denunciations.
