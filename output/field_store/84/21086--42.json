We have to remember that all the revolutionary portraits  are distorted by furious passion, and that Marie Antoinette may no more  deserve to be compared to Mary Stuart than Robespierre deserves to be  compared to Ezzelino or to Alva. The aristocrats were the libellers, if  libels they were. It is at least certain that, from the unlucky hour  when the Austrian archduchess crossed the French frontier, a childish  bride of fourteen, down to the hour when the Queen of France made the  attempt to recross it in resentful flight one and twenty years  afterwards, Marie Antoinette was ignorant, unteachable, blind to events  and deaf to good counsels, a bitter grief to her heroic mother, the evil  genius of her husband, the despair of her truest advisers, and an  exceedingly bad friend to the people of France. When Burke had that  immortal vision of her at Versailles--'just above the horizon,  decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in,  glittering like the morning star, full of life and splendour and  joy'--we know from the correspondence between Maria Theresa and her  minister at Versailles, that what Burke really saw was no divinity, but  a flighty and troublesome schoolgirl, an accomplice in all the ignoble  intrigues, and a sharer of all the small busy passions, that convulse  the insects of a court. The levity that came with her Lorraine blood,  broke out in incredible dissipations; in indiscreet visits to the masked  balls at the opera, in midnight parades and mystifications on the  terrace at Versailles, in insensate gambling. 'The court of France is  turned into a gaming-hell,' said the Emperor Joseph, the Queen's own  brother: 'if they do not amend, the revolution will be cruel.' These  vices or follies were less mischievous than her intervention in affairs  of state. Here her levity was as marked as in the paltry affairs of the  boudoir and the ante-chamber, and here to levity she added both  dissimulation and vindictiveness. It was the Queen's influence that  procured the dismissal of the two virtuous ministers by whose aid the  King was striving to arrest the decay of the government of his kingdom.  Malesherbes was distasteful to her for no better reason than that she  wanted his post for some favourite's favourite. Against Turgot she  conspired with tenacious animosity, because he had suppressed a  sinecure which she designed for a court parasite, and because he would  not support her caprice on behalf of a worthless creature of her  faction. These two admirable men were disgraced on the same day. The  Queen wrote to her mother that she had not meddled in the affair. This  was a falsehood, for she had even sought to have Turgot thrown into the  Bastille. 'I am as one dashed to the ground,' cried the great Voltaire,  now nearing his end. 'Never can we console ourselves for having seen the  golden age dawn and vanish. My eyes see only death in front of me, now  that Turgot is gone. The rest of my days must be all bitterness.' What  hope could there be that the personage who had thus put out the light of  hope for France in 1776, would welcome that greater flame which was  kindled in the land in 1789?    When people write hymns of pity for the Queen, we always recall the poor  woman whom Arthur Young met, as he was walking up a hill to ease his  horse near Mars-le-Tour. Though the unfortunate creature was only  twenty-eight, she might have been taken for sixty or seventy, her figure  was so bent, her face so furrowed and hardened by toil. Her husband, she  said, had a morsel of land, one cow, and a poor little horse, yet he had  to pay forty-two pounds of wheat and three chickens to one Seigneur, and  one hundred and sixty pounds of oats, one chicken, and one franc to  another, besides very heavy tailles and other taxes; and they had seven  children. She had heard that 'something was to be done by some great  folks for such poor ones, but she did not know who nor how, but God send  us better, for the tailles and the dues grind us to the earth.' It was  such hapless drudges as this who replenished the Queen's gaming tables  at Versailles. Thousands of them dragged on the burden of their harassed  and desperate days, less like men and women than beasts of the field  wrung and tortured and mercilessly overladen, in order that the Queen  might gratify her childish passion for diamonds, or lavish money and  estates on worthless female Polignacs and Lamballes, or kill time at a  cost of five hundred louis a night at lansquenet and the faro bank. The  Queen, it is true, was in all this no worse than other dissipated women  then and since. She did not realise that it was the system to which she  had stubbornly committed herself, that drove the people of the fields to  cut their crops green to be baked in the oven, because their hunger  could not wait; or made them cower whole days in their beds, because  misery seemed to gnaw them there with a duller fang. That she was  unconscious of its effect, makes no difference in the real drift of her  policy; makes no difference in the judgment that we ought to pass upon  it, nor in the gratitude that is owed to the stern men who rose up to  consume her and her court with righteous flame. The Queen and the  courtiers, and the hard-faring woman of Mars-le-Tour, and that whole  generation, have long been dust and shadow; they have vanished from the  earth, as if they were no more than the fire-flies that the peasant of  the Italian poet saw dancing in the vineyard, as he took his evening  rest on the hillside. They have all fled back into the impenetrable  shade whence they came; our minds are free; and if social equity is not  a chimera, Marie Antoinette was the protagonist of the most barbarous  and execrable of causes.           *       *       *       *       *    Let us return to the shaping of the Constitution, not forgetting that  its stability was to depend upon the Queen. Robespierre left some  characteristic marks on the final arrangements. He imposed upon the  Assembly a motion prohibiting any member of it from accepting office  under the Crown for a period of four years after the dissolution.  Robespierre from this time forth constantly illustrated a very singular  truth; namely, that the most ostentatious faith in humanity in general  seems always to beget the sharpest distrust of all human beings in  particular. He proceeded further in the same direction. It was  Robespierre who persuaded the Chamber to pass a self-denying ordinance.  All its members were declared ineligible for a seat in the legislature  that was to replace them. The members of the Right on this occasion went  with their bitter foes of the Extreme Left, and to both parties have  been imputed sinister and Machiavellian motives. The Right, aware that  their own return to the new Assembly was impossible, were delighted to  reduce the men with whom they had been carrying on incensed battle for  two long years, to their own obscurity and impotence. Robespierre, on  the other hand, is accused of a jealous desire to exclude Barnave from  power. He is accused also of a deliberate intention to weaken the new  legislature, in order to secure the preponderance of the Parisian clubs.  There is no evidence that these malignant feelings were in Robespierre's  mind. The reasons he gave were exactly of the kind that we should have  expected to weigh with a man of his stamp. There is even a certain truth  in them, that is not inconsistent with the experience of a parliamentary  country like our own. To talk, he said, of the transmission of light and  experience from one assembly to another, was to distrust the public  spirit. The influence of opinion and the general good grows less, as the  influence of parliamentary orators grows greater. He had no taste, he  proceeded with one of his chilly sneers, for that new science which was  styled the tactics of great assemblies; it was too like intrigue.  Nothing but truth and reason ought to reign in a legislature. He did not  like the idea of clever men becoming dominant by skilful tactics, and  then perpetuating their empire from one assembly to another. He wound up  his discourse with some theatrical talk about disinterestedness. When he  sat down, he was greeted with enthusiastic acclamations, such as a few  months before used to greet the stormful Mirabeau, now wrapped in  eternal sleep amid the stillness of the new Pantheon. The folly of  Robespierre's inferences is obvious enough. If only truth and reason  ought to weigh in a legislature, then it is all the more important not  to exclude any body of men through whom truth and reason may possibly  enter. Robespierre had striven hard to remove all restrictions from  admission to the electoral franchise. He did not see that to limit the  choice of candidates was in itself the most grievous of all  restrictions.    The common view has been that the Constitution of 1791 perished because  its creators were thus disabled from defending the work of their hands.  This view led to a grave mistake four years later, after Robespierre had  gone to his grave. The Convention, framing the Constitution of the Year  III., decided that two-thirds of the existing assembly should keep their  places, and that only one-third should be popularly elected. This led to  the revolt of the Thirteenth Vendemiaire, and afterwards to the coup  d'etat of the Eighteenth Fructidor. In that sense, no doubt,  Robespierre's proposal was the indirect root of much mischief. But it is  childish to believe that if a hundred of the most prominent members of  the Constituent had found seats in the new assembly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1,"Palace the genie had built.    For a time they lived very happily, but the Magician, who had gone to  Africa after he had left Aladdin to perish in the cavern, at length  happened to hear of Aladdin's fame and riches; and guessing at once the  source of all this wealth, he returned once more to China, determined to  gain possession of the magic lamp.    [Illustration]    He bought a number of new and beautiful lamps, disguised himself as an  old beggar-man, and then, waiting until Aladdin was out hunting, he came  to the windows of the Palace, crying out:    \"New lamps for old; new lamps for old.\"    When the Princess heard this strange cry she was very much amused.    \"Let us see,\" she said to her ladies, \"whether this foolish fellow means  what he says; there is an ugly old lamp in Aladdin's room,\" and taking  the precious lamp, which Aladdin always kept by his bedside, she sent it  out to the old man by one of the slaves, saying--    \"Give me a new lamp for this!\"    [Illustration]    The Magician was overjoyed. He saw at once that it was the very lamp he  wanted, and giving the Princess the best of the new ones in exchange, he  hurried away with his treasure. As soon as he found himself alone, he  summoned the slave of the lamp, and told him to carry himself, the  Palace, and the Princess Badroulboudour to the farthest corner of  Africa. This order the genie at once obeyed.    When Aladdin returned from hunting and found that his wife and his  Palace had vanished, he was overcome with anguish, guessing that his  enemy, the Magician, had by some means got possession of the lamp. The  Sultan, whose grief and anger at the loss of his daughter were terrible,  ordered him to leave the Court at once, and told him that unless he  returned in forty days with the Princess safe and well, he would have  him beheaded.    Aladdin went out from the Sultan's presence, not knowing what to do or  where to turn. But after he had wandered about for some time in despair,  he remembered the ring which he still wore on his finger. He rubbed it,  and in a moment the genie stood before him. But when Aladdin commanded  him to bring back the Palace and the Princess, the genie answered--    \"What you command is not in my power. You must ask the slave of the  lamp. I am only the slave of the ring.\"    \"Then,\" said Aladdin, \"if you cannot bring my Palace to me, I command  you to take me to my Palace.\" No sooner were the words out of his mouth  than he found himself standing in Africa, close to the missing Palace.    The Princess Badroulboudour, who, since the moment when the Magician had  had her in his power, had not ceased to weep and lament for her  foolishness in exchanging the lamp, happened to be looking out of the  window; and when she saw Aladdin she nearly fainted with joy, and sent  a slave to bring him secretly into the Palace.    Then she and Aladdin made a plan to get the better of the Magician and  to recover the lost lamp. Aladdin summoned the genie of the ring, who  procured for him a very powerful sleeping-powder, which he gave to the  Princess. Then Aladdin hid himself behind some curtains in the room,  and the Princess sent a message to the Magician asking him to take  supper with her.    [Illustration]    The Magician was delighted at the Princess's invitation, and accepted  it joyfully, never dreaming that Aladdin had found his way to Africa.    As they were eating and drinking together, the Princess put the  sleeping-powder into the Magician's cup of wine--and no sooner had he  tasted it than he fell down in a deep sleep as if dead.    This was Aladdin's chance. Hastily coming out from behind the curtains,  he snatched the lamp from the Magician's bosom, and called the genie to  come to his assistance.    The genie, having first thrown out the Magician, then carried the Palace  with the Princess and Aladdin back to the spot from which it had been  taken.    Great was the Sultan's joy at receiving back his daughter. The whole  city was given over to rejoicings, and for ten days nothing was heard  but the sound of drums and trumpets and cymbals, and nothing was seen  but illuminations and gorgeous entertainments in honor of Aladdin's safe  return.    [Illustration]    Aladdin and the Princess ascended the throne after the Sultan died and  they lived long and happily and had many beautiful children.    [Illustration]          THE SLEEPING BEAUTY    [Illustration]      Once upon a time there lived a King and Queen who had no children. They  longed very much for a child; and when at last they had a little  daughter they were both delighted, and great rejoicings took place.    When the time came for the little Princess to be christened, the King  made a grand feast and invited all but one of the fairies in his kingdom  to be godmothers. There happened to be thirteen fairies in the kingdom;  but as the King had only twelve gold plates, he had to leave one of  them out.    The twelve fairies that were invited came to the christening, and  presented the little Princess with the best gifts in their possession.  One gave her beauty, one gave her wisdom, another grace, another  goodness, until all but one had presented their offerings. Just as the  last fairy was about to step forward and offer her gift, there came a  tremendous knocking at the door, and before anybody could get there to  open it, it was burst open, and in came the thirteenth fairy, in a  furious rage at not having been invited to the feast.    When she saw all the gifts which the other fairies had presented the  child, she laughed and exclaimed:    \"A lot of good all this beauty and virtue and wealth will do to you, my  pretty Princess! You shall pay for the slight your Royal Father has put  upon me!\" Then, turning to the terrified King and Queen, she said, in a  loud voice:    \"When the Princess is fifteen years old she shall prick her finger with  a spindle and die!\" Having said this she flew away as noisily as she  came.    The King and Queen were in despair, and the courtiers stood aghast at  the terrible disaster; while the little Princess began to cry piteously,  as if she knew the fate in store for her. Then the twelfth fairy stepped  forward.    \"Do not be afraid,\" she said, \"I have not yet given my gift. I cannot  undo the wicked spell, but I can soften the evil. The Princess, on her  fifteenth birthday, shall prick her finger with a spindle, but she shall  not die. Instead, she shall fall asleep for a hundred years.\"    \"Alas!\" cried the Queen, \"what comfort will that be to us? Long before  the hundred years are past we shall be dead, and our darling child will  be as lost to us as if she were indeed to die!\"    [Illustration]    \"I can make that right,\" said the fairy. \"When the Princess falls  asleep, you shall sleep, too; and awaken with her when the hundred  years are passed.\"    But the King still hoped to save his daughter from such a terrible  misfortune. So he ordered all the spinning-wheels in his kingdom to be  burnt or destroyed, and made a law that no one was to use one on pain of  instant death. But all his care was useless. On her fifteenth birthday  the Princess slipped away from her attendants, and wandered all through  the Palace. At last she came to a tower which she had never seen before,  and, wondering what it contained, she climbed the stairs. From a room at  the top came a curious humming noise, and the Princess, wondering what  it could be, pushed open the door and stepped inside.    There sat an old woman, bent with age, working at a strangely shaped  wheel. The Princess was full of curiosity.    [Illustration]    \"What is that funny-looking thing?\" she asked.    \"It is a spinning-wheel, Princess,\" answered the old woman, who was no  other than the wicked fairy in disguise.    \"A spinning-wheel--what is that? I have never heard of such a thing,\"  said the Princess. She stood watching for a few minutes, then she added:    \"It looks quite easy. May I try to do it?\"    \"Certainly, gracious lady,\" said the wicked fairy, and the Princess sat  down and tried to turn the wheel. But no sooner did she lay her hand  upon it than the spindle, which was enchanted, pricked her finger, and  the Princess fell back against a silk-covered couch--fast asleep.    In a moment a deep silence fell upon all who were in the castle. The  King fell asleep in the midst of his councillors, the Queen with her  ladies-in-waiting. The horses in the stable, the pigeons on the roof,  the flies upon the walls, even the very fire upon the hearth fell  asleep, too. The meat which was cooking in the kitchen ceased to  frizzle; and the cook, who was just about to box the kitchen boy's  ears, fell asleep with her hand outstretched, and began to snore  aloud. The butler who was tasting the ale, fell asleep with the  jug at his lips.    A great hedge sprang up around the castle, which, as the years passed  on, grew and grew until it formed an impenetrable barrier around the  sleeping Palace. The old people of the country died, and their children  grew up and died also, and their children, and their children, and the  story of the sleeping Princess became a legend, handed down from one  generation to another; and a cloud of mystery, as thick and impenetrable  as the hedge of thorns, lay over the old castle. Many brave and gallant  Princes tried to force their way through the magic hedge, in order to  solve the mystery and to see for themselves the beautiful maiden who lay  in an enchanted sleep behind that thorny barrier. But the thorns caught  them, and held them from going forward or back, and the gallant youths  perished miserably in the thickets.    [Illustration]    After many, many years there came a King's son into that country, who  heard the story of the Princess and the hedge of briers; and he made up  his mind to try and force his way to the castle to awake the sleeping  Princess.
