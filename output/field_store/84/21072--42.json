Broken crockery, spreading water, his own  shoes--exceedingly old tennis shoes--well soaked, attested the fact  that damage had been done.    \"Lor'! Mr. Ukridge, sir, is that you?\" said the red-headed man calmly.  \"I thought you was burglars.\"    A sharp bark from the other side of the kitchen door, followed by a  renewal of the scratching, drew Mr. Beale's attention to his faithful  hound.    \"That's Bob,\" he said.    \"I don't know what you call the brute,\" said Ukridge. \"Come in and tie  him up.\"    \"'Ow am I to get in, Mr. Ukridge, sir?\"    \"Come in through the window, and mind what you're doing with that gun.  After you've finished with the dog, I should like a brief chat with  you, if you can spare the time and have no other engagements.\"    Mr. Beale, having carefully deposited his gun against the wall of the  kitchen, and dropped a pair of very limp rabbits with a thud to the  floor, proceeded to climb through the window. This operation  performed, he stood on one side while the besieged garrison passed out  by the same road.    \"You will find me in the garden, Beale,\" said Ukridge. \"I have one or  two little things to say to you.\"    Mr. Beale grinned affably.    The cool air of the garden was grateful after the warmth of the  kitchen. It was a pretty garden, or would have been, if it had not  been so neglected. Garnet seemed to see himself sitting in a deck  chair on the lawn, looking through the leaves of the trees at the  harbor below. It was a spot, he felt, in which it would be an easy and  pleasant task to shape the plot of his novel. He was glad he had come.  About now, outside his lodgings in town, a particularly lethal barrel  organ would be striking up the latest revolting air with which the  halls had inflicted London.    \"Here you are, Beale,\" said Ukridge, as the red-headed man approached.  \"Now, then, what have you to say?\"    The hired man looked thoughtful for a while, then observed that it was  a fine evening. Garnet felt that he was begging the question. He was a  strong, healthy man, and should have scorned to beg.    \"Fine evening?\" shouted Ukridge. \"What--on--earth has that got to do  with it? I want to know why you and Mrs. Beale were both out when we  arrived?\"    \"The missus went to Axminster, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"    \"She had no right to go to Axminster. I don't pay her large sums to go  to Axminster. You knew I was coming this evening.\"    \"No, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"    \"You didn't!\"    \"No, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"    \"Beale,\" said Ukridge with studied calm, \"one of us two is a fool.\"    \"I noticed that, sir.\"    \"Let us sift this matter to the bottom. You got my letter?\"    \"No, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"    \"My letter saying that I should arrive to-night. You did not get it?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Now look here, Beale,\" said Ukridge, \"I am certain that that letter  was posted. I remember placing it in my pocket for that purpose. It is  not there now. See. These are all the contents of my--well, I'm  hanged!\"    He stood looking at the envelope he had produced from his breast  pocket. Mr. Beale coughed.    \"Beale,\" said Ukridge, \"you--er--there seems to have been a mistake.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You are not so much to blame as I thought.\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Anyhow,\" said Ukridge, in inspired tones, \"I'll go and slay that  infernal dog. Where's your gun, Beale?\"    But better counsels prevailed, and the proceedings closed with a cold  but pleasant little dinner, at which the spared mongrel came out  unexpectedly strong with brainy and diverting tricks.          BUCKLING TO    V      Sunshine, streaming into his bedroom through the open window, woke  Garnet next day as distant clocks were striking eight. It was a lovely  morning, cool and fresh. The grass of the lawn, wet with dew, sparkled  in the sun. A thrush, who knew all about early birds and their  perquisites, was filling in the time before the arrival of the worm  with a song or two as he sat in the bushes. In the ivy a colony of  sparrows were opening the day well with a little brisk fighting. On  the gravel in front of the house lay the mongrel Bob, blinking lazily.    The gleam of the sea through the trees turned Garnet's thoughts to  bathing. He dressed quickly and went out. Bob rose to meet him,  waving an absurdly long tail. The hatchet was definitely buried now.  That little matter of the jug of water was forgotten.    \"Well, Bob,\" said Garnet, \"coming down to watch me bathe?\"    Bob uttered a bark of approval and ran before him to the gate.    A walk of five minutes brought Garnet to the sleepy little town. He  passed through the narrow street, and turned on to the beach, walking  in the direction of the cob, that combination of pier and breakwater  which the misadventures of one of Jane Austen's young misses have made  known to the outside public.    The tide was high, and Garnet, leaving his clothes to the care of Bob,  dived into twelve feet of clear, cold water. As he swam he compared it  with the morning tub of town, and felt that he had done well to come  with Ukridge to this pleasant spot. But he could not rely on unbroken  calm during the whole of his visit. He did not know a great deal about  chicken farming, but he was certain that Ukridge knew less. There  would be some strenuous moments before that farm became a profitable  commercial speculation. At the thought of Ukridge toiling on a hot  afternoon to manage an undisciplined mob of fowls, and becoming more  and more heated and voluble in the struggle, he laughed and promptly  swallowed a generous mouthful of salt water. There are few things  which depress the swimmer more than an involuntary draught of water.  Garnet turned and swam back to Bob and the clothes.    As he strolled back along the beach he came upon a small, elderly  gentleman toweling his head in a vigorous manner. Hearing Garnet's  footsteps, he suspended this operation for a moment and peered out at  him from beneath a turban of towel.    It was the elderly Irishman of the journey, the father of the  blue-eyed Phyllis. Then they had come on to Lyme Regis after all.  Garnet stopped, with some idea of going back and speaking to him; but  realizing that they were perfect strangers, he postponed this action  and followed Bob up the hill. In a small place like Lyme Regis it  would surely not be difficult to find somebody who would introduce  them. He cursed the custom which made such a thing necessary. In a  properly constituted country everybody would know everybody else  without fuss or trouble.    He found Ukridge, in his shirt sleeves and minus a collar, assailing a  large ham. Mrs. Ukridge, looking younger and more childlike than ever  in brown holland, smiled at him over the teapot.    \"Here he is!\" shouted Ukridge, catching sight of him. \"Where have you  been, old horse? I went to your room, but you weren't there. Bathing?  Hope it's made you feel fit for work, because we've got to buckle to  this morning.\"    \"The fowls have arrived, Mr. Garnet,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, opening her  eyes till she looked like an astonished kitten. \"_Such_ a lot of them!  They're making such a noise!\"    And to support her statement there floated through the window a  cackling, which, for volume and variety of key, beat anything that  Garnet had ever heard. Judging from the noise, it seemed as if England  had been drained of fowls and the entire tribe of them dumped into the  yard of the Ukridge's farm.    \"There seems to have been no stint,\" he said, sitting down. \"Did you  order a million or only nine hundred thousand?\"    \"Good many, aren't there?\" said Ukridge complacently. \"But that's  what we want. No good starting on a small scale. The more you have,  the bigger the profits.\"    \"What sort have you got mostly?\"    \"Oh, all sorts. Bless you, people don't mind what breed a fowl is, so  long as it _is_ a fowl. These dealer chaps were so infernally  particular. 'Any Dorkings?' they said. 'All right,' I said, 'bring on  your Dorkings.' 'Or perhaps you want a few Minorcas?' 'Very well,' I  said, 'show Minorcas.' They were going on--they'd have gone on for  hours, but I stopped 'em. 'Look here, Maximilian,' I said to the  manager Johnny--decent old chap, with the manners of a marquis--'look  here,' I said, 'life is short, and we're neither of us as young as we  used to be. Don't let us waste the golden hours playing guessing  games. I want fowls. You sell fowls. So give me some of all sorts.'  And he has, by Jove! There must be one of every breed ever invented.\"    \"Where are you going to put them?\"    \"That spot we chose by the paddock. That's the place. Plenty of mud  for them to scratch about in, and they can go into the field when they  want to, and pick up worms, or whatever they feed on. We must rig them  up some sort of a shanty, I suppose, this morning. We'll go and tell  'em to send up some wire netting and stuff from the town.\"    \"Then we shall want hencoops. We shall have to make those.\"    \"Of course. So we shall. Millie, didn't I tell you that old Garnet was  the man to think of things! I forgot the coops. We can't buy some, I  suppose? On tick?\"    \"Cheaper to make them. Suppose we get a lot of boxes. Soap boxes are  as good as any. It won't take long to knock up a few coops.\"    Ukridge thumped the table with enthusiasm.    \"Garny, old horse, you're a marvel. You think of everything. We'll  buckle to right away. What a noise those fowls are making. I suppose  they don't feel at home in the yard. Wait till they see the A1  residential mansions we're going to put up for them. Finished  breakfast? Then let's go out. Come along, Millie.\"    The red-headed Beale, discovered leaning in an attitude of thought on  the yard gate, and observing the feathered mob below, was roused from  his reflections and dispatched to the town for the wire and soap  boxes. Ukridge, taking his place at the gate, gazed at the fowls with  the affectionate eye of a proprietor.    \"Well, they have certainly taken you at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20547"],[0,"Stories of Birds (#6)"],[1,"believe, but perhaps she is  right.    \"At any rate, they are my children and I do the best I can for them.  To me they are very dear, but I fear they will go through life as  unloved as I!  Caw!  Caw!  Caw!\"    The chicken-hawk ruffled his brown feathers carelessly.  He drew in his  breath, making a whistling noise which to Phyllis, hiding so quietly  below, sounded quite like escaping steam.    \"People do not like me either,\" said the hawk, shrugging his shoulders.  \"But for all that I shall not sit and mourn.    \"I know that my feathers are handsome.  I know that I am a good husband  and father.  I know that I can sail about in the air as gracefully as  any bird in the world.    \"I sometimes eat insects, but I wonder, Mr. Raven, at your fondness for  corn and grain.  You should try some of these small birds which are  flying about.\"    \"I fear--\" began the raven.    \"Fear?\" cried the hawk, striking out with his strong curved claws.  \"I  do not know what fear is!  Look at my short curved bill!  Look at my  sharp claws!  Look at my long wings, which can carry me so swiftly and  so far!    \"There is scarcely a bird of the air which does not fear me.  They skim  out of sight at my approach.    \"You should see me pounce upon young ducks.  It is great fun.  Yesterday I was soaring above the pond, when I saw a whole family of  young ducks out for their first swim.  Without a sound I dropped down,  seized one, and bore it off in my claws.  I sat in the tree-top to eat  it.  It was very tender, but also very small.  I decided to have  another.  This time the young ducks saw me.  They dived head first into  the water.    \"I laughed to myself.  I knew that they would soon come up.  When in  half a minute one appeared, I was quick enough to catch him.    \"Later I carried a small chicken home to my nest in the big oak on the  hill yonder.  My nest is a very simple affair,--just a few crooked  sticks.  The lining is of leaves and a few pieces of loose bark which  we picked up.    \"Come and see me sometime, Mr. Raven.  I will show my babies to you.  They are wonderful birdlings with bright yellow eyes and bluish bills.    \"Just now I must be off.  I see Mrs. Speckle has ventured out from the  bushes again and that little girl with the flapping hat--\"    The little girl and the \"flapping hat\" sprang up from the fence-corner  with such a shout that the chicken-hawk circled away into the air and  did not return that day.    The raven flew away, crying sadly, \"Caw!  Caw!  Caw!\"  Mother Speckle  went on quietly catching bugs for her downy babies.          THE FIRST HAWK    During the short Greenland summer the Eskimos live along the seacoast.  They put up their strange skin huts and hunt and fish and make merry  through the season when the sun shines at midnight.    Now in places along the Greenland coast there are steep high cliffs.  Here the birds which fly farther north in summer make their nests.    Often, as the Eskimo sits by his campfire, he hears the half-angry,  half-sad cry of \"Kea!  Kea!  Kea!\"  Looking up then, he often sees a  lonely hawk sitting on the highest, most desolate cliff.    The Eskimo father laughs when he hears this cry and sees the lonely  bird on the cliff top.  Then the little Eskimo children creep nearer to  their father with certainty that a new story is in store for them.    \"Tell us the story of the hawk!\" the Eskimo children cry eagerly.    This then is the story which the Eskimo father tells to his little ones  \"in their funny furry clothes.\"    \"Long, long ago in a tiny Eskimo village, there lived a strange-looking  old woman.  Her neck was so short that she really looked as though she  had no neck at all and as though her head was set upon her shoulders.    \"People laughed when they saw the funny-looking old woman.  Some were  so unkind as to make fun of her strange appearance.    \"This unkindness made the old woman very unhappy.    \"By and bye the children of the village went every day to the hut of  the old woman to play.    \"They teased and tormented her.  If she raised the bearskin curtain at  the doorway and spoke to them they did not heed her.    \"'Short neck!  Short neck!' the rude children shouted.  Then they stood  and laughed at her.    \"So it came that the poor old woman grew more and more unhappy.  To  escape her tormentors she often climbed to the cliff tops and sat on  the edges of high rocks where it was difficult to follow.    \"Here, safe and quiet, she would sit for hours.  Sometimes in her  loneliness she raised her arms above her head and cried aloud.    \"The people of the tiny Eskimo village often saw the lonely figure on  the cliffs.  They noticed that the old woman stayed less and less in  her little snow hut in the village.    \"Then one morning an Eskimo child, looking up, thought she saw the old  woman sitting as usual on the rocks.  But the child's brother said that  he saw only a strange bird with a very short neck.    \"At that moment the bird raised its wings and flapped them above its  head.    \"'Kea!  Kea!  Kea!' cried the strange new bird.  'Kea!  Kea!  Kea! who  was it called me short neck?'    \"'Ah,' said the children's father, looking up from his fishing-nets, 'I  think you both were right.'\"          ORIGIN OF THE RAVEN AND THE MACAW    (ZUNI CREATION MYTH)    Long, long ago there were but few Indians on the earth.  The world was  not as it is now.  The earth people did not understand things as they  now understand them.    It therefore happened that a beautiful Indian prince came to live with  the earth people.    In his hand he carried a plume stick.  It was a magic wand and was  covered with feathers of beautiful colours.    There were yellow feathers.  There were red feathers.  There were  blue-green feathers.  There were black and white and gray feathers.    Fastened to this magic wand were also many strange shells and charms  which the earth children did not understand and which the strange  prince did not explain fully.    \"What is this strange plume stick?\" asked the earth children.    \"It is the magic wand which tests the hearts of earth children,\" was  the reply.    The earth children wondered, but they did not understand.    \"Ah, but show us what you mean!\" they cried, eagerly.    \"Look!\" replied the strange prince.    Then amid the plumes and charms of the magic wand there appeared four  round things.    \"They are eggs!\" cried the earth children.  \"Two are blue like the sky.  Two are red-brown like the dust of our own pleasant earth!\"    Then the earth children asked many questions which the strange prince  tried patiently to explain.    \"Now,\" said the strange prince, \"choose whichever eggs you will.  By  and bye they will hatch.  From them will come birds such as you never  before have seen.  From each pair of eggs will come a pair of birds.\"    \"You who choose the blue eggs shall follow the birds which come from  the blue shells.  You and your children and your children's children  shall dwell in the land in which these birds nest.    \"You who choose the red-brown eggs shall follow the birds which come  from the red-brown shells.  You and your children and your children's  children shall dwell in the land in which these birds nest!\"    \"But which shall we choose?\" cried the eager earth children.    \"Nay,\" said the strange prince, \"that I may not tell.  But this much  you may know:    \"From one pair of eggs shall come forth beautiful birds.  Their  feathers shall be coloured, like the leaves and fruits of summer.  They  shall nest in the land of everlasting summer-time and plenty.    \"They who choose those eggs will follow these birds to the beautiful  country of summer-time.  The fruits will ripen daily and fall into the  hands of the lucky earth children.  Their food will come to them  without labour and they shall know neither hunger nor cold.\"    \"And what will happen if we choose the other pair of eggs?\"    The strange prince shook his head half sadly and smiled on the earth  children.    \"From the other pair of eggs,\" he said, \"shall come forth birds with  black feathers, piebald with white.  This pair will nest in a land  where you may gain food by labour only.    \"Those who follow this pair of birds shall struggle summer and winter.  By long days of toil they shall provide food.  By long nights of  watchfulness they shall keep warmth within their homes.\"    Then the strange prince ceased speaking.  The earth children looked at  each other and forgot to speak.  Each looked into the eyes of the other  and asked a question.  Each wished to follow the birds which would lead  them to the land of everlasting summer-time and idleness and plenty.    \"Which eggs do you choose?\" asked the strange prince.    \"The blue--the blue!\" cried the earth children.  Then those who were  strongest and quickest pushed forward.    They fought for the blue eggs, and getting them hurried away with  gladness.    They buried the blue eggs in the soft loam on the sunny side of the  cliff.  They sat down to watch when the young birds should hatch.    Now there remained those weaker earth children who had been pushed  aside.  For them there was no choice.  The strange prince gave into  their hand the red-brown eggs.    The red-brown eggs were placed amid the soft green grasses by the  riverside.  The earth children into whose care they were given sat also  by the riverside and waited.    Sometimes, as they waited for the hatching of the red-brown eggs, they  looked up to the place in the cliff where the stronger ones watched the  beautiful blue eggs.    Then the weaker ones sighed and turned to the ugly red-brown eggs amid  the grasses.    By and bye, as those on the cliff waited, they heard faint tappings  inside the blue shells.    \"Ah,\" they said, \"the birds will come soon now.  They will lead us to  the land of summer-time.\"    When at length the shells burst and the young birds came out, they  looked much as other birds look.  They had large mouths and"]]]
