There had been rain in the  night, and the trees were still dripping. Presently, however,  there appeared in the leaden haze a watery patch of blue: and  through this crevice in the clouds the sun, diffidently at first  but with gradually increasing confidence, peeped down on the  fashionable and exclusive turf of Grosvenor Square. Stealing  across the square, its rays reached the massive stone walls of  Drexdale House, until recently the London residence of the earl  of that name; then, passing through the window of the  breakfast-room, played lightly on the partially bald head of Mr.  Bingley Crocker, late of New York in the United States of  America, as he bent over his morning paper. Mrs. Bingley Crocker,  busy across the table reading her mail, the rays did not touch.  Had they done so, she would have rung for Bayliss, the butler, to  come and lower the shade, for she endured liberties neither from  Man nor from Nature.    Mr. Crocker was about fifty years of age, clean-shaven and of a  comfortable stoutness. He was frowning as he read. His smooth,  good-humoured face wore an expression which might have been  disgust, perplexity, or a blend of both. His wife, on the other  hand, was looking happy. She extracted the substance from her  correspondence with swift glances of her compelling eyes, just as  she would have extracted guilty secrets from Bingley, if he had  had any. This was a woman who, like her sister Nesta, had been  able all her life to accomplish more with a glance than other  women with recrimination and threat. It had been a popular belief  among his friends that her late husband, the well-known Pittsburg  millionaire G. G. van Brunt, had been in the habit of  automatically confessing all if he merely caught the eye of her  photograph on his dressing table.    From the growing pile of opened envelopes Mrs. Crocker looked up,  a smile softening the firm line of her lips.    \"A card from Lady Corstorphine, Bingley, for her at-home on the  twenty-ninth.\"    Mr. Crocker, still absorbed, snorted absently.    \"One of the most exclusive hostesses in England. . . . She has  influence with the right sort of people. Her brother, the Duke of  Devizes, is the Premier's oldest friend.\"    \"Uh?\"    \"The Duchess of Axminster has written to ask me to look after a  stall at her bazaar for the Indigent Daughters of the Clergy.\"    \"Huh?\"    \"Bingley! You aren't listening. What is that you are reading?\"    Mr. Crocker tore himself from the paper.    \"This? Oh, I was looking at a report of that cricket game you  made me go and see yesterday.\"    \"Oh? I am glad you have begun to take an interest in cricket. It  is simply a social necessity in England. Why you ever made such a  fuss about taking it up, I can't think. You used to be so fond of  watching baseball and cricket is just the same thing.\"    A close observer would have marked a deepening of the look of  pain on Mr. Crocker's face. Women say this sort of thing  carelessly, with no wish to wound: but that makes it none the  less hard to bear.    From the hall outside came faintly the sound of the telephone,  then the measured tones of Bayliss answering it. Mr. Crocker  returned to his paper.    Bayliss entered.    \"Lady Corstorphine desires to speak to you on the telephone,  madam.\"    Half-way to the door Mrs. Crocker paused, as if recalling  something that had slipped her memory.    \"Is Mr. James getting up, Bayliss?\"    \"I believe not, madam. I am informed by one of the house-maids  who passed his door a short time back that there were no sounds.\"    Mrs. Crocker left the room. Bayliss, preparing to follow her  example, was arrested by an exclamation from the table.    \"Say!\"    His master's voice.    \"Say, Bayliss, come here a minute. Want to ask you something.\"    The butler approached the table. It seemed to him that his  employer was not looking quite himself this morning. There was  something a trifle wild, a little haggard, about his expression.  He had remarked on it earlier in the morning in the Servants'  Hall.    As a matter of fact, Mr. Crocker's ailment was a perfectly simple  one. He was suffering from one of those acute spasms of  home-sickness, which invariably racked him in the earlier Summer  months. Ever since his marriage five years previously and his  simultaneous removal from his native land he had been a chronic  victim to the complaint. The symptoms grew less acute in Winter  and Spring, but from May onward he suffered severely.    Poets have dealt feelingly with the emotions of practically every  variety except one. They have sung of Ruth, of Israel in bondage,  of slaves pining for their native Africa, and of the miner's  dream of home. But the sorrows of the baseball bug, compelled by  fate to live three thousand miles away from the Polo Grounds,  have been neglected in song. Bingley Crocker was such a one, and  in Summer his agonies were awful. He pined away in a country  where they said \"Well played, sir!\" when they meant \"'at-a-boy!\"    \"Bayliss, do you play cricket?\"    \"I am a little past the age, sir. In my younger days . . .\"    \"Do you understand it?\"    \"Yes, sir. I frequently spend an afternoon at Lord's or the Oval  when there is a good match.\"    Many who enjoyed a merely casual acquaintance with the butler  would have looked on this as an astonishingly unexpected  revelation of humanity in Bayliss, but Mr. Crocker was not  surprised. To him, from the very beginning, Bayliss had been a  man and a brother who was always willing to suspend his duties in  order to answer questions dealing with the thousand and one  problems which the social life of England presented. Mr.  Crocker's mind had adjusted itself with difficulty to the  niceties of class distinction: and, while he had cured himself of  his early tendency to address the butler as \"Bill,\" he never  failed to consult him as man to man in his moments of perplexity.  Bayliss was always eager to be of assistance. He liked Mr.  Crocker. True, his manner might have struck a more sensitive man  than his employer as a shade too closely resembling that of an  indulgent father towards a son who was not quite right in the  head: but it had genuine affection in it.    Mr. Crocker picked up his paper and folded it back at the  sporting page, pointing with a stubby forefinger.    \"Well, what does all this mean? I've kept out of watching cricket  since I landed in England, but yesterday they got the poison  needle to work and took me off to see Surrey play Kent at that  place Lord's where you say you go sometimes.\"    \"I was there yesterday, sir. A very exciting game.\"    \"Exciting? How do you make that out? I sat in the bleachers all  afternoon, waiting for something to break loose. Doesn't anything  ever happen at cricket?\"    The butler winced a little, but managed to smile a tolerant  smile. This man, he reflected, was but an American and as such  more to be pitied than censured. He endeavoured to explain.    \"It was a sticky wicket yesterday, sir, owing to the rain.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"The wicket was sticky, sir.\"    \"Come again.\"    \"I mean that the reason why the game yesterday struck you as slow  was that the wicket--I should say the turf--was sticky--that is  to say wet. Sticky is the technical term, sir. When the wicket is  sticky, the batsmen are obliged to exercise a great deal of  caution, as the stickiness of the wicket enables the bowlers to  make the ball turn more sharply in either direction as it strikes  the turf than when the wicket is not sticky.\"    \"That's it, is it?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Thanks for telling me.\"    \"Not at all, sir.\"    Mr. Crocker pointed to the paper.    \"Well, now, this seems to be the box-score of the game we saw  yesterday. If you can make sense out of that, go to it.\"    The passage on which his finger rested was headed \"Final Score,\"  and ran as follows:                    SURREY                 First Innings        Hayward, c Wooley, b Carr ....... 67      Hobbs, run out ................... 0      Hayes, st Huish, b Fielder ...... 12      Ducat, b Fielder ................ 33      Harrison, not out ............... 11      Sandham, not out ................. 6      Extras .......................... 10        Total (for four wickets) ....... 139    Bayliss inspected the cipher gravely.    \"What is it you wish me to explain, sir?\"    \"Why, the whole thing. What's it all about?\"    \"It's perfectly simple, sir. Surrey won the toss, and took first  knock. Hayward and Hobbs were the opening pair. Hayward called  Hobbs for a short run, but the latter was unable to get across  and was thrown out by mid-on. Hayes was the next man in. He went  out of his ground and was stumped. Ducat and Hayward made a  capital stand considering the stickiness of the wicket, until  Ducat was bowled by a good length off-break and Hayward caught at  second slip off a googly. Then Harrison and Sandham played out  time.\"    Mr. Crocker breathed heavily through his nose.    \"Yes!\" he said. \"Yes! I had an idea that was it. But I think I'd  like to have it once again, slowly. Start with these figures.  What does that sixty-seven mean, opposite Hayward's name?\"    \"He made sixty-seven runs, sir.\"    \"Sixty-seven! In one game?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Why, Home-Run Baker couldn't do it!\"    \"I am not familiar with Mr. Baker, sir.\"    \"I suppose you've never seen a ball-game?\"    \"Ball-game, sir?\"    \"A baseball game?\"    \"Never, sir.\"    \"Then, Bill,\" said Mr. Crocker, reverting in his emotion to the  bad habit of his early London days, \"you haven't lived.

While the voice is in what might be called a state of ferment the  singer is only anxious to produce tones, and diction slips by the  wayside. The appreciative listener should be able to know whether a lack  of diction on the singer's part means immaturity or simply slovenliness.    Still another fault in voice production is the tremolo. It is the  over-ambitious singer, the singer who forces a small, light organ to do  heavy work, who develops the tremolo.    The tremolo is a sure sign that the vocal chords have been stretched  beyond their natural limits, and there is only one thing can cure this.  That is absolute rest for some time and then beginning the study of the  voice, first singing with the mouth closed and relying entirely on very  gentle breath pressure for the production of the sound.    The pupil suffering from tremolo or even very strong vibrato must have  courage to stop at once and to forego having a big voice. After all, the  most beautiful voices in the world are not necessarily the biggest  voices, and certainly the tremolo is about the worst fault a singer can  have. But that, like almost any other vocal defect, can be cured by  persistent effort of the right kind.    In singing in public as well as when practicing the singer must stand so  that the body will be perfectly and firmly poised. One should always  stand in such a position as to be able to inhale comfortably and control  a large breath, to allow the throat absolute freedom, with the head  sufficiently raised to let the inflowing air penetrate all the resonance  cavities.    The great thing to avoid is stiffness or discomfort of any kind in the  pose. At the same time one must have a gracious air, and while feeling  perfectly solidly poised on the feet, must make the impression of a  certain lightness and freedom from all bodily restraint.    I have not meant in these short articles to give you anything but a very  general idea of the salient points of the art of singing. After all,  each one must do the real work herself.    The road is full of discouragements and hardships, but there is always  something new and interesting to learn, and to achieve success, whether  for the public or merely for the home circle, is worth all the trouble  one can take. And so I wish you all success.          THE ART OF SINGING    By Enrico Caruso    [Illustration: ENRICO CARUSO]          The Career of Enrico Caruso    HOW A NEAPOLITAN MECHANIC'S SON BECAME THE WORLD'S GREATEST TENOR      Enrico Caruso enjoys the reputation of being the greatest tenor since  Italo Campanini. The latter was the legitimate successor of Brignoli, an  artist whose wonderful singing made his uncouth stage presence a matter  of little moment. Caruso's voice at its best recalls Brignoli to the  veteran opera habitue. It possesses something of the dead tenor's  sweetness and clarity in the upper register, but it lacks the delicacy  and artistic finish of Campanini's supreme effort, although it is vastly  more magnetic and thrill inspiring.    That Caruso is regarded as the foremost living tenor is made good by the  fact that he is the highest priced male artist in the world. Whenever  and wherever he sings multitudes flock to hear him, and no one goes away  unsatisfied. He is constantly the recipient of ovations which  demonstrate the power of his minstrelsy, and his lack of especial  physical attractiveness is no bar to the witchery of his voice.    Caruso is a Neapolitan and is now thirty-five years of age. Unlike so  many great Italian tenors, he is not of peasant parentage. His father  was a skilled mechanic who had been put in charge of the warehouses of a  large banking and importing concern. As a lad Enrico used to frequent  the docks in the vicinity of these warehouses and became an expert  swimmer at a very early age. In those halcyon days his burning ambition  was to be a sailor, and he had a profound distaste for his father's plan  to have him learn a trade.    At the age of ten he was still a care free and fun loving boy, without a  thought beyond the docks and their life. It was then that his father  ruled that since he would not become a mechanic he must be sent to  school. He had already learned to read a little, but that was all. He  was sent to a day school in the neighborhood, and he accepted the  restraint with such bad grace that he was in almost constant disgrace.  His long association with the water front had made him familiar with the  art of physical defense, and he was in frequent trouble on that account.    The head master of the school was a musician, and he discovered one day  that his unruly pupil could sing. He was an expert in the development of  the boy soprano and he soon realized that in young Caruso he had a  veritable treasure. He was shrewd enough to keep his discovery to  himself for some time, for he determined to profit by the boy's  extraordinary ability. The lad was rehearsed privately and was  stimulated to further effort by the promise of sweetmeats and release  from school duties. Finally the unscrupulous master made engagements for  the young prodigy to sing at fashionable weddings and concerts, but he  always pocketed the money which came from these public appearances.    At the end of the second year, when Caruso was twelve years of age, he  decided that he had had enough of the school, and he made himself so  disagreeable to the head master that he was sent home in disgrace. His  irate father gave him a sound thrashing and declared that he must be  apprenticed to a mechanical engineer. The boy took little interest in  his new work, but showed some aptitude for mechanical drawing and  calligraphy. In a few months he became so interested in sketching that  he began to indulge in visions of becoming a great artist.    When he was fifteen his mother died, and, since he had kept at the  mechanical work solely on her account, he now announced his intention  of forsaking engineering and devoting himself to art and music. When his  father heard of this open rebellion he fell into a great rage and  declared that he would have no more of him, that he was a disgrace to  the family and that he need not show his face at home.    So Caruso became a wanderer, with nothing in his absolute possession  save a physique that was perfect and an optimism that was never failing.  He picked up a scanty livelihood by singing at church festivals and  private entertainments and in time became known widely as the most  capable boy soprano in Naples. Money came more plentifully, and he was  able to live generously. In a short time his voice was transformed into  a marvelous alto, and he soon found himself in great demand and was  surfeited with attention from the rich and powerful. It was about this  time that King Edward, then Prince of Wales, heard him sing in a  Neapolitan church and was so delighted that he invited the boy to go to  England, an invitation which young Caruso did not accept. Now that he  had \"arrived\" Naples was good enough for him.    One day something happened which plunged him into the deepest despair.  Without a warning of any sort his beautiful alto voice disappeared,  leaving in its place only the feeblest and most unmusical of croaks. He  was so overcome at his loss that he shut himself up in his room and  would see no one. It was the first great affliction he had ever known,  and he admits that he meditated suicide. He had made many friends, and  some of them would have been glad to comfort him, but his grief would  admit of no partnership.    One evening when he was skulking along an obscure highway, at the very  bottom of the well of his despair, a firm hand was laid on his shoulder  and a cheery voice called out: \"Whither so fast? Come home with me, poor  little shaver!\"    It was Messiani, the famous baritone, who had always felt an interest in  the boy and who would not release him in spite of his vigorous efforts  to escape. The big baritone took him to his lodging and when he had  succeeded in cheering the unhappy lad into a momentary forgetfulness of  his misery asked him to sing.    \"But I can't,\" sobbed Caruso. \"It has gone!\"    Messiani went to the piano and struck a chord. The weeping boy piped up  in a tone so thin and feeble that it was almost indistinguishable.    \"Louder!\" yelled the big singer, with another full chord. Caruso obeyed  and kept on through the scale. Then Messiani jumped up from the piano  stool, seized the astonished boy about the waist and raised him high off  his feet, at the same time yelling at the top of his voice: \"What a  little jackass! What a little idiot!\"    Almost bursting with rage, for the miserable boy thought his friend was  making sport of him, Caruso searched the apartment for some weapon with  which he might avenge himself. Seizing a heavy brass candlestick, he  hurled it at Messiani with all his force, but it missed the baritone and  landed in a mirror.    \"Hold, madman!\" interposed the startled singer. \"Your voice is not gone.  It is magnificent. You will be the tenor of the century.\"    Messiani sent him to Vergine, then the most celebrated trainer of the  voice in Italy. The maestro was not so enthusiastic as Messiani, but he  promised to do what he could. He offered to instruct Caruso four years,  only demanding 25 per cent. of his pupil's receipts for his first five  years in opera. Caruso signed such a contract willingly, although he  realized afterward that he was the victim of a veritable Shylock.    When Vergine was through with the young tenor he dismissed him without  lavish commendation, but with a reminder of the terms of his contract.  Caruso obtained an engagement in Naples, but did not achieve marked  success at once. On every payday Vergine was on hand to receive his  percentage. His regularity finally attracted the attention of"]]]
