In the time of planting sweet potatoes, \"Grandmother  Betty,\" as she was familiarly called, was sent for in all directions,  simply to place the seedling potatoes in the hills; for superstition had  it, that if \"Grandmamma Betty but touches them at planting, they will be  sure to grow and flourish.\" This high reputation was full of advantage  to her, and to the children around her. Though Tuckahoe had but few of  the good things of{28} life, yet of such as it did possess grandmother  got a full share, in the way of presents. If good potato crops came  after her planting, she was not forgotten by those for whom she planted;  and as she was remembered by others, so she remembered the hungry little  ones around her.    The dwelling of my grandmother and grandfather had few pretensions. It  was a log hut, or cabin, built of clay, wood, and straw. At a  distance it resembled--though it was smaller, less commodious and less  substantial--the cabins erected in the western states by the first  settlers. To my child's eye, however, it was a noble structure,  admirably adapted to promote the comforts and conveniences of its  inmates. A few rough, Virginia fence-rails, flung loosely over the  rafters above, answered the triple purpose of floors, ceilings, and  bedsteads. To be sure, this upper apartment was reached only by a  ladder--but what in the world for climbing could be better than a  ladder? To me, this ladder was really a high invention, and possessed  a sort of charm as I played with delight upon the rounds of it. In this  little hut there was a large family of children: I dare not say how  many. My grandmother--whether because too old for field service, or  because she had so faithfully discharged the duties of her station in  early life, I know not--enjoyed the high privilege of living in a cabin,  separate from the quarter, with no other burden than her own support,  and the necessary care of the little children, imposed. She evidently  esteemed it a great fortune to live so. The children were not her own,  but her grandchildren--the children of her daughters. She took delight  in having them around her, and in attending to their few wants. The  practice of separating children from their mother, and hiring the latter  out at distances too great to admit of their meeting, except at long  intervals, is a marked feature of the cruelty and barbarity of the  slave system. But it is in harmony with the grand aim of slavery, which,  always and everywhere, is to reduce man to a level with the brute. It is  a successful method of obliterating{29 \"OLD MASTER\"} from the mind and  heart of the slave, all just ideas of the sacredness of _the family_, as  an institution.    Most of the children, however, in this instance, being the children of  my grandmother's daughters, the notions of family, and the reciprocal  duties and benefits of the relation, had a better chance of being  understood than where children are placed--as they often are in the  hands of strangers, who have no care for them, apart from the wishes  of their masters. The daughters of my grandmother were five in number.  Their names were JENNY, ESTHER, MILLY, PRISCILLA, and HARRIET. The  daughter last named was my mother, of whom the reader shall learn more  by-and-by.    Living here, with my dear old grandmother and grandfather, it was a  long time before I knew myself to be _a slave_. I knew many other things  before I knew that. Grandmother and grandfather were the greatest people  in the world to me; and being with them so snugly in their own little  cabin--I supposed it be their own--knowing no higher authority over me  or the other children than the authority of grandmamma, for a time there  was nothing to disturb me; but, as I grew larger and older, I learned  by degrees the sad fact, that the \"little hut,\" and the lot on which it  stood, belonged not to my dear old grandparents, but to some person who  lived a great distance off, and who was called, by grandmother, \"OLD  MASTER.\" I further learned the sadder fact, that not only the house and  lot, but that grandmother herself, (grandfather was free,) and all  the little children around her, belonged to this mysterious personage,  called by grandmother, with every mark of reverence, \"Old Master.\" Thus  early did clouds and shadows begin to fall upon my path. Once on the  track--troubles never come singly--I was not long in finding out another  fact, still more grievous to my childish heart. I was told that this  \"old master,\" whose name seemed ever to be mentioned with fear and  shuddering, only allowed the children to live with grandmother for a  limited time, and that in fact as soon{30} as they were big enough, they  were promptly taken away, to live with the said \"old master.\" These  were distressing revelations indeed; and though I was quite too young  to comprehend the full import of the intelligence, and mostly spent my  childhood days in gleesome sports with the other children, a shade of  disquiet rested upon me.    The absolute power of this distant \"old master\" had touched my young  spirit with but the point of its cold, cruel iron, and left me something  to brood over after the play and in moments of repose. Grandmammy was,  indeed, at that time, all the world to me; and the thought of being  separated from her, in any considerable time, was more than an unwelcome  intruder. It was intolerable.    Children have their sorrows as well as men and women; and it would be  well to remember this in our dealings with them. SLAVE-children _are_  children, and prove no exceptions to the general rule. The liability  to be separated from my grandmother, seldom or never to see her again,  haunted me. I dreaded the thought of going to live with that mysterious  \"old master,\" whose name I never heard mentioned with affection, but  always with fear. I look back to this as among the heaviest of my  childhood's sorrows. My grandmother! my grandmother! and the little hut,  and the joyous circle under her care, but especially _she_, who made  us sorry when she left us but for an hour, and glad on her return,--how  could I leave her and the good old home?    But the sorrows of childhood, like the pleasures of after life,  are transient. It is not even within the power of slavery to write  _indelible_ sorrow, at a single dash, over the heart of a child.                    _The tear down childhood's cheek that flows,                  Is like the dew-drop on the rose--                  When next the summer breeze comes by,                  And waves the bush--the flower is dry_.      There is, after all, but little difference in the measure of contentment  felt by the slave-child neglected and the slaveholder's{31 COMPARATIVE  HAPPINESS} child cared for and petted. The spirit of the All Just  mercifully holds the balance for the young.    The slaveholder, having nothing to fear from impotent childhood, easily  affords to refrain from cruel inflictions; and if cold and hunger do  not pierce the tender frame, the first seven or eight years of the  slave-boy's life are about as full of sweet content as those of the most  favored and petted _white_ children of the slaveholder. The slave-boy  escapes many troubles which befall and vex his white brother. He seldom  has to listen to lectures on propriety of behavior, or on anything else.  He is never chided for handling his little knife and fork improperly  or awkwardly, for he uses none. He is never reprimanded for soiling the  table-cloth, for he takes his meals on the clay floor. He never has the  misfortune, in his games or sports, of soiling or tearing his clothes,  for he has almost none to soil or tear. He is never expected to act like  a nice little gentleman, for he is only a rude little slave. Thus, freed  from all restraint, the slave-boy can be, in his life and conduct, a  genuine boy, doing whatever his boyish nature suggests; enacting, by  turns, all the strange antics and freaks of horses, dogs, pigs, and  barn-door fowls, without in any manner compromising his dignity, or  incurring reproach of any sort. He literally runs wild; has no pretty  little verses to learn in the nursery; no nice little speeches to make  for aunts, uncles, or cousins, to show how smart he is; and, if he can  only manage to keep out of the way of the heavy feet and fists of the  older slave boys, he may trot on, in his joyous and roguish tricks, as  happy as any little heathen under the palm trees of Africa. To be  sure, he is occasionally reminded, when he stumbles in the path of his  master--and this he early learns to avoid--that he is eating his _\"white  bread,\"_ and that he will be made to _\"see sights\"_ by-and-by. The  threat is soon forgotten; the shadow soon passes, and our sable boy  continues to roll in the dust, or play in the mud, as bests suits him,  and in the veriest freedom. If he feels uncomfortable, from mud or from  dust, the coast is clear; he can plunge into{32} the river or the pond,  without the ceremony of undressing, or the fear of wetting his clothes;  his little tow-linen shirt--for that is all he has on--is easily dried;  and it needed ablution as much as did his skin. His food is of the  coarsest kind, consisting for the most part of cornmeal mush, which  often finds it way from the wooden tray to his mouth in an oyster shell.  His days, when the weather is warm, are spent in the pure, open air, and  in the bright sunshine. He always sleeps in airy apartments; he seldom  has to take powders, or to be paid to swallow pretty little sugar-coated  pills, to cleanse his blood, or to quicken his appetite. He eats no  candies; gets no lumps of loaf sugar; always relishes his food; cries  but little, for nobody cares for his crying; learns to esteem his  bruises but slight, because"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#6)"],[1,"-sat and all his warriors. At any  time may we go to the village where my father is chief, for Ja-don  always will welcome the friends of his son. But for Tarzan to enter  A-lur is another matter, though there is a way and he has the courage  to put it to the test--listen, come close for Jad-ben-Otho has keen  ears and this he must not hear,\" and with his lips close to the ears of  his companions Ta-den, the Tall-tree, son of Ja-don, the Lion-man,  unfolded his daring plan.    And at the same moment, a hundred miles away, a lithe figure, naked but  for a loin cloth and weapons, moved silently across a thorn-covered,  waterless steppe, searching always along the ground before him with  keen eyes and sensitive nostrils.        3    Pan-at-lee    Night had fallen upon unchartered Pal-ul-don. A slender moon, low in  the west, bathed the white faces of the chalk cliffs presented to her,  in a mellow, unearthly glow. Black were the shadows in Kor-ul-JA,  Gorge-of-lions, where dwelt the tribe of the same name under Es-sat,  their chief. From an aperture near the summit of the lofty escarpment a  hairy figure emerged--the head and shoulders first--and fierce eyes  scanned the cliff side in every direction.    It was Es-sat, the chief. To right and left and below he looked as  though to assure himself that he was unobserved, but no other figure  moved upon the cliff face, nor did another hairy body protrude from any  of the numerous cave mouths from the high-flung abode of the chief to  the habitations of the more lowly members of the tribe nearer the  cliff's base. Then he moved outward upon the sheer face of the white  chalk wall. In the half-light of the baby moon it appeared that the  heavy, shaggy black figure moved across the face of the perpendicular  wall in some miraculous manner, but closer examination would have  revealed stout pegs, as large around as a man's wrist protruding from  holes in the cliff into which they were driven. Es-sat's four handlike  members and his long, sinuous tail permitted him to move with  consummate ease whither he chose--a gigantic rat upon a mighty wall. As  he progressed upon his way he avoided the cave mouths, passing either  above or below those that lay in his path.    The outward appearance of these caves was similar. An opening from  eight to as much as twenty feet long by eight high and four to six feet  deep was cut into the chalklike rock of the cliff, in the back of this  large opening, which formed what might be described as the front  veranda of the home, was an opening about three feet wide and six feet  high, evidently forming the doorway to the interior apartment or  apartments. On either side of this doorway were smaller openings which  it were easy to assume were windows through which light and air might  find their way to the inhabitants. Similar windows were also dotted  over the cliff face between the entrance porches, suggesting that the  entire face of the cliff was honeycombed with apartments. From many of  these smaller apertures small streams of water trickled down the  escarpment, and the walls above others was blackened as by smoke.  Where the water ran the wall was eroded to a depth of from a few inches  to as much as a foot, suggesting that some of the tiny streams had been  trickling downward to the green carpet of vegetation below for ages.    In this primeval setting the great pithecanthropus aroused no jarring  discord for he was as much a part of it as the trees that grew upon the  summit of the cliff or those that hid their feet among the dank ferns  in the bottom of the gorge.    Now he paused before an entrance-way and listened and then, noiselessly  as the moonlight upon the trickling waters, he merged with the shadows  of the outer porch. At the doorway leading into the interior he paused  again, listening, and then quietly pushing aside the heavy skin that  covered the aperture he passed within a large chamber hewn from the  living rock. From the far end, through another doorway, shone a light,  dimly. Toward this he crept with utmost stealth, his naked feet giving  forth no sound.  The knotted club that had been hanging at his back  from a thong about his neck he now removed and carried in his left hand.    Beyond the second doorway was a corridor running parallel with the  cliff face. In this corridor were three more doorways, one at each end  and a third almost opposite that in which Es-sat stood.  The light was  coming from an apartment at the end of the corridor at his left. A  sputtering flame rose and fell in a small stone receptacle that stood  upon a table or bench of the same material, a monolithic bench  fashioned at the time the room was excavated, rising massively from the  floor, of which it was a part.    In one corner of the room beyond the table had been left a dais of  stone about four feet wide and eight feet long. Upon this were piled a  foot or so of softly tanned pelts from which the fur had not been  removed. Upon the edge of this dais sat a young female Waz-don. In one  hand she held a thin piece of metal, apparently of hammered gold, with  serrated edges, and in the other a short, stiff brush. With these she  was occupied in going over her smooth, glossy coat which bore a  remarkable resemblance to plucked sealskin. Her loin cloth of yellow  and black striped JATO-skin lay on the couch beside her with the  circular breastplates of beaten gold, revealing the symmetrical lines  of her nude figure in all its beauty and harmony of contour, for even  though the creature was jet black and entirely covered with hair yet  she was undeniably beautiful.    That she was beautiful in the eyes of Es-sat, the chief, was evidenced  by the gloating expression upon his fierce countenance and the  increased rapidity of his breathing. Moving quickly forward he entered  the room and as he did so the young she looked up. Instantly her eyes  filled with terror and as quickly she seized the loin cloth and with a  few deft movements adjusted it about her. As she gathered up her  breastplates Es-sat rounded the table and moved quickly toward her.    \"What do you want?\" she whispered, though she knew full well.    \"Pan-at-lee,\" he said, \"your chief has come for you.\"    \"It was for this that you sent away my father and my brothers to spy  upon the Kor-ul-lul? I will not have you. Leave the cave of my  ancestors!\"    Es-sat smiled. It was the smile of a strong and wicked man who knows  his power--not a pleasant smile at all. \"I will leave, Pan-at-lee,\" he  said; \"but you shall go with me--to the cave of Es-sat, the chief, to  be the envied of the shes of Kor-ul-JA.  Come!\"    \"Never!\" cried Pan-at-lee. \"I hate you. Sooner would I mate with a  Ho-don than with you, beater of women, murderer of babes.\"    A frightful scowl distorted the features of the chief. \"She-JATO!\" he  cried. \"I will tame you! I will break you! Es-sat, the chief, takes  what he will and who dares question his right, or combat his least  purpose, will first serve that purpose and then be broken as I break  this,\" and he picked a stone platter from the table and broke it in his  powerful hands. \"You might have been first and most favored in the cave  of the ancestors of Es-sat; but now shall you be last and least and  when I am done with you you shall belong to all of the men of Es-sat's  cave. Thus for those who spurn the love of their chief!\"    He advanced quickly to seize her and as he laid a rough hand upon her  she struck him heavily upon the side of his head with her golden  breastplates. Without a sound Es-sat, the chief, sank to the floor of  the apartment. For a moment Pan-at-lee bent over him, her improvised  weapon raised to strike again should he show signs of returning  consciousness, her glossy breasts rising and falling with her quickened  breathing. Suddenly she stooped and removed Es-sat's knife with its  scabbard and shoulder belt.  Slipping it over her own shoulder she  quickly adjusted her breastplates and keeping a watchful glance upon  the figure of the fallen chief, backed from the room.    In a niche in the outer room, just beside the doorway leading to the  balcony, were neatly piled a number of rounded pegs from eighteen to  twenty inches in length. Selecting five of these she made them into a  little bundle about which she twined the lower extremity of her sinuous  tail and thus carrying them made her way to the outer edge of the  balcony. Assuring herself that there was none about to see, or hinder  her, she took quickly to the pegs already set in the face of the cliff  and with the celerity of a monkey clambered swiftly aloft to the  highest row of pegs which she followed in the direction of the lower  end of the gorge for a matter of some hundred yards. Here, above her  head, were a series of small round holes placed one above another in  three parallel rows. Clinging only with her toes she removed two of the  pegs from the bundle carried in her tail and taking one in either hand  she inserted them in two opposite holes of the outer rows as far above  her as she could reach. Hanging by these new holds she now took one of  the three remaining pegs in each of her feet, leaving the fifth grasped  securely in her tail. Reaching above her with this member she inserted  the fifth peg in one of the holes of the center row and then,  alternately hanging by her tail, her feet, or her hands, she moved the  pegs upward to new holes, thus carrying her stairway with her as she  ascended.    At the summit of the cliff a gnarled tree exposed its time-worn roots  above the topmost holes forming the last step from the sheer face of  the precipice to level footing. This was the last avenue of escape for  members of the tribe hard pressed by enemies from below. There were  three such emergency exits from the village and it were death to use  them in other than an emergency.  This Pan-at-lee well knew; but she  knew, too, that it were worse than death to remain "]]]
