[Illustration]      JELLY JAKE AND BUTTER BILL        [Illustration]      Jelly Jake and Butter Bill    One dark night when all was still    Pattered down the long, dark stair,    And no one saw the guilty pair;    Pushed aside the pantry-door    And there found everything galore,--    Honey, raisins, orange-peel,    Cold chicken aplenty for a meal,    Gingerbread enough to fill    Two such boys as Jake and Bill.    Well, they ate and ate and ate,    Gobbled at an awful rate    Till I'm sure they soon weighed more    Than double what they did before.    And then, it's awful, still it's true,    The floor gave way and they went thru.    Filled so full they couldn't fight.    Slowly they sank out of sight.    Father, Mother, Cousin Ann,    Cook and nurse and furnace man    Fished in forty-dozen ways    After them, for twenty days;    But not a soul has chanced to get    A glimpse or glimmer of them yet.    And I'm afraid we never will--    Poor Jelly Jake and Butter Bill.      [Illustration]            CUT UP A CAPER        Cut up a caper,    You've got a paper    And I've got a widget of string.    You be the army    And let nothing harm me    For I am the captain and king.      [Illustration]            [Illustration: WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TREAT]      EAT, EAT, EAT        Here come the sweet potatoes    And here's the Sunday meat,    I guess we must be ready now    To eat, eat, eat.      I'm going to have the nicey plate    And Daddy's leather seat,    And wear my patent-leather shoes    To eat, eat, eat.      My Daddy's talking all about    The war, and some old fleet,    I wonder if he never, never,    Never wants to eat.      We're going to have some apple-cake,    We're going to have a treat.    O hurry, hurry, Daddy,    Let us eat, eat, eat.            [Illustration]      HETTY HUTTON        Hetty Hutton,    Here's a button,    Sew it on your dress.      Willie Waller,    Here's a dollar,    Maybe more or less.      Mister Shuster,    Here's a rooster,    Put him in a pen.      Mister Saxon,    Get an ax an'    Let him out again.            [Illustration]      A BIG, FAT POTATO        A big, fat potato lay down on a clod    In the shade of some burdock and tall goldenrod,    And he dreamed he were king of the whole garden plot,    With a palace and throne, and a crown with a lot    Of jewels and diamonds and gold till it shone    Like the front of a show when the lights are turned on.    He had to be minded by all of the plants;    When he whistled the radishes knew they must dance;    When he tooted his horn the cucumbers must sing    To a vegetable crowd gathered round in a ring.    He made all the cabbages stand in a row    While a sunflower instructed them just how to grow;    The bright yellow pumpkins he painted light blue;    Took the clothes off the scare-crow and made him buy new.    He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand    To be king and commander o'er all the wide land.    But at last he woke up with an awful surprise    And found a blind mole kicking sand in his eyes.      [Illustration]            A BUNDLE OF HAY        A bundle of hay    From Baffin's Bay,    A johnny-cake from Rome,    A man and a mule    From Ultima Thule    To carry the cargo home.      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      PETER, POPPER        Peter, popper, dopper, Dan,    Catch a moonbeam if you can;    Climb a cedar ten feet high    And pick the planets from the sky.    You're a wonder, little man--    Peter, popper, dopper, Dan.            OLD FATHER ANNUM        Old Father Annum on New Year's Day    Picked up his bag of months and years,    Thrust in his hand in a careless way,    And pulled a wee fellow out by the ears.    \"There you are,\" said he to the waiting crowd,    \"He's as good as any I have in my pack.    I never can tell, but I hope to be proud    Of the little rascal when I come back.\"      [Illustration: OLD FATHER ANNUM]            THE TIPPANY FLOWER        O what will you take for a tippany flower,    And what will you take for a pansy?    I'll take a smile for the tippany flower,    And a kiss for the pretty pansy.            [Illustration]      HERE COMES A CABBAGE        Here comes a cabbage with a bonnet on its head,    A pretty purple bonnet with a bow of blue and red;    And here comes a bottle with a collar 'round its neck,    A handsome linen collar, too, without a spot or speck;    Next comes a meat-saw, his job is biting beef,    And according to the cleaver he has gold in all his teeth;    And last of all there comes along, amid the ringing cheers,    A princely Indian corn-stalk with rings in both his ears.            [Illustration]      PLENTY        There are plenty feathers on a hen    And prickers on a rose,    There is plenty roaring in a den    Of lions, goodness knows;      There are plenty fishes in the lake    And islands in the sea;    There are plenty raisins in this cake    For even you and me.            THE RUNAWAYS        A pipe and a spoon and a tenpenny nail    Stole a tin dishpan and went for a sail.    But the cook he grew curious,    Fussy, and furious;    Gathered his trappings, and went on their trail.    He found them that night in a pitiful plight,    And sent them all home on the ten o'clock mail.      [Illustration]            [Illustration: HI! HI! WHO WILL BUY A WEE LITTLE CLOUD]      THE SALESMAN        Hi! Hi! Who will buy    A wee little cloud for the pretty blue sky?    Some are purple, some are red,    And all are soft as a feather bed.    Hi! Little children, won't any one buy    One little cloud for the pretty blue sky?            A RACE, A RACE TO MOSCOW        A race, a race to Moscow,    Before the close of day!    A race, a race to Moscow,    A long, long way!    First comes a butterfly a-riding on a frog,    Next comes a water rat a-floating on a log;    A caterpillar on the fence, a hopper in the hay--    Who'll get to Moscow before the close of day?            [Illustration]      A PRINCE FROM PEPPERVILLE        A prince came down from Pepperville    In satin and in lace,    He wore a bonnet on his head    And whiskers on his face.      And when he came to Battleburg    This is what befell:    He gave the king and cabinet    A half a peanut shell.            [Illustration]      BOATS        Hitch up your cattle    And drive to Seattle    To see all the boats come in,--    From Kibi and Kobi    And Panama Dobi    And some from the Islands of Myn.    They're bringing us rices    And cocoa and spices    And pineapples done up in tin,    And maybe Aunt Dinah    Will come back from China    If ever the boats get in.            PRETTY THINGS        Pretty poppies,    Pretty trees,    Pretty little lettuce-leaves,    Pretty pebbles,    Red and brown,    Pretty floating thistle-down.    Pretty baby,    Curly head,    Standing in a pansy-bed,    Pretty clouds    All white and curled--    O the great, big pretty world!      [Illustration: PRETTY THINGS]            DID YOU EVER?        Did you ever go to the watering trough    And watch the sparrows drink?    Did you ever go to Potter's pond    And see the divers sink?    Did you ever steal to the barn at night    And watch the hoot-owls think?            [Illustration]      HOOTEM, TOOTEM, CLEAR THE TRACK        Hootem, tootem, clear the track!    I caught a coon on Kamiak!    Colonel Clapp and Uncle Rome    Have hired a hack to bring it home.            DOCTOR DRAKE        On a hummock by the lake    Stands the home of Doctor Drake,    Poor old doctor, how he works!    Week by week he never shirks--      Pulling teeth for guinea-fowl,    Soothing puppies when they howl,    Whittling out a hickory peg    For a gander's broken leg,      Giving medicine away    About a hundred times a day,    Linseed oil and elder-bark    To a croaking meadowlark,      Nasty, bitter yarrow-tea    To a tipsy bumble-bee,    A poultice made of plantain leaves    To cure a rabbit with the heaves.      Fever, colic, cramp, or stitch,    Kitten-croup or beaver's-itch,    Any kind of pain or ache    Is cured by dear, old Doctor Drake.            [Illustration]      BABIES        Come to the land where the babies grow,    Like flowers in the green, green grass.    Tiny babes that swing and crow    Whenever the warm winds pass,    And laugh at their own bright eyes aglow    In a fairy looking-glass.      Come to the sea where the babies sail    In ships of shining pearl,    Borne to the west by a golden gale    Of sun-beams all awhirl;    And perhaps a baby brother will sail    To you, my little girl.            TWENTY THIEVES FROM ALBION        Twenty thieves from Albion,    All with butcher knives,    Coming on the dead run,    Fighting for their lives.      See the man from our town.    In a fancy vest,    Knocking all the big ones down,    Chasing all the rest.      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      AS I CAME OUT OF GRUNDY GREET        As I came out of Grundy Greet    Four cats were marching down the street      One was long and gray and thin    With lots of whiskers on his chin,      And one was round and sleek and fat    (He must have been a butcher's cat).      One was dapper, slight, and frail,    With bells and tassels on his tail,      And one had starey yellow eyes    Almost as big as pumpkin pies.      These four came marching down the street    As I came out of Grundy Greet.
