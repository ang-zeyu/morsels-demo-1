Shann's own hold on the weapon tightened, and  the force of the other's pull dragged him partly around.    \"Let's have that----\"    \"Why?\" Shann supposed that because it had been the other's well-aimed  rock which had put the Throg out of commission permanently, the officer  was going to claim their only spoils of war as personal booty, and a hot  resentment flowered in the younger man.    \"We don't take that away from here.\" Thorvald made the weapon his with a  quick twist.    To Shann's utter astonishment, the Survey officer walked back to kneel  beside the dead Throg. He worked the grip of the blaster under the  alien's lax claws and inspected the result with the care of one  arranging a special and highly important display. Shann's protest became  vocal. \"We'll need that!\"    \"It'll do us far more good right where it is....\" Thorvald paused and  then added, with impatience roughening his voice as if he disliked the  need for making any explanations, \"There is no reason for us to  advertise our being alive. If the Throgs found a blaster missing, they'd  start thinking and looking around. I want to have a breathing spell  before I have to play quarry in one of their hunts.\"    Put that way, his action did make sense. But Shann regretted the loss of  an arm so superior to their own weapons. Now they could not loot the  plateship either. In silence he turned and started to trudge southward,  without waiting for Thorvald to catch up with him.    Once away from the blasted area, the wolverines ranged ahead at their  clumsy gallop, which covered ground at a surprising rate of speed. Shann  knew that their curiosity made them scouts surpassing any human and that  the men who followed would have ample warning of any danger to come.  Without reference to his silent trail companion, he sent the animals  toward another strip of woodland which would give them cover against the  coming of any Throg flyer.    As the hours advanced he began to cast about for a proper night camp.  The woods ought to give them a usable site.    \"This is a water wood,\" Thorvald said, breaking the silence for the  first time since they had left the wrecks.    Shann knew that the other had knowledge, not only of the general  countryside, but of exploring techniques which he himself did not  possess, but to be reminded of that fact was an irritant rather than a  reassurance. Without answering, the younger man bored on to locate the  water promised.    The wolverines found the small lake first and were splashing along its  shore when the Terrans caught up. Thorvald went to work, but to Shann's  surprise he did not unstrap the force-blade ax at his belt. Bending over  a sapling, he pounded away with a stone at the green wood a few inches  above the root line until he was able to break through the slender  trunk. Shann drew his own knife and bent to tackle another treelet when  Thorvald stopped him with an order: \"Use a stone on that, the way I  did.\"    Shann could see no reason for such a laborious process. If Thorvald did  not want to use his ax, that was no reason that Shann could not put his  heavy belt knife to work. He hesitated, ready to set the blade to the  outer bark of the tree.    \"Look--\" again that impatient edge in the officer's tone, the need for  explanation seeming to come very hard to the other--\"sooner or later the  Throgs might just trace us here and find this camp. If so, they are  _not_ going to discover any traces to label us Terran----\"    \"But who else could we be?\" protested Shann. \"There is no native race on  Warlock.\"    Thorvald tossed his improvised stone ax from hand to hand.    \"But do the Throgs know that?\"    The implications, the possibilities, in that idea struck home to Shann.  Now he began to understand what Thorvald might be planning.    \"Now there is going to be a native race.\" Shann made a statement instead  of a question and saw that the other was watching him with a new  intentness, as if he had at last been recognized as a person instead of  rank and file and very low rank at that--Survey personnel.    \"There is going to be a native race,\" Thorvald affirmed.    Shann resheathed his knife and went to search the pond beach for a  suitable stone to use in its place. Even so, he made harder work of the  clumsy chopping than Thorvald had. He worried at one sapling after  another until his hands were skinned and his breath came in painful  gusts from under aching ribs. Thorvald had gone on to another task,  ripping the end of a long tough vine from just under the powdery surface  of the thick leaf masses fallen in other years.    With this the officer lashed together the tops of the poles, having  planted their splintered butts in the ground, so that he achieved a  crudely conical erection. Leafy branches were woven back and forth  through this framework, with an entrance, through which one might crawl  on hands and knees, left facing the lakeside. The shelter they completed  was compact and efficient but totally unlike anything Shann had ever  seen before, certainly far removed from the domes of the camp. He said  so, nursing his raw hands.    \"An old form,\" Thorvald replied, \"native to a primitive race on Terra.  Certainly the beetle-heads haven't come across its like before.\"    \"Are we going to stay here? Otherwise it is pretty heavy work for one  night's lodging.\"    Thorvald tested the shelter with a sharp shake. The matted leaves  whispered, but the framework held.    \"Stage dressing. No, we won't linger here. But it's evidence to support  our play. Even a Throg isn't dense enough to believe that natives would  make a cross-country trip without leaving evidence of their passing.\"    Shann sat down with a sigh he made no effort to suppress. He had a  vision of Thorvald traveling southward, methodically erecting these huts  here and there to confound Throgs who might not ever chance upon them.  But already the Survey officer was busy with a new problem.    \"We need weapons----\"    \"We have our stunners, a force ax, and our knives,\" Shann pointed out.  He did not add, as he would have liked that they could have had a  blaster.    \"Native weapons,\" Thorvald countered with his usual snap. He went back  to the beach and crawled about there, choosing and rejecting stones  picked out of the gravel.    Shann scooped out a small pit just before their hut and set about the  making of a pocket-sized fire. He was hungry and looked longingly now  and again to the supply bag Thorvald had brought with him. Dared he  rummage in that for rations? Surely the other would be carrying  concentrates.    \"Who taught you how to make a fire that way?\" Thorvald was back from the  pond, a selection of round stones about the size of his fist resting  between his chest and his forearm.    \"It's regulation, isn't it?\" Shann countered defensively.    \"It's regulation,\" Thorvald agreed. He set down his stones in a row and  then tossed the supply bag over to his companion. \"Too late to hunt  tonight. But well have to go easy on those rations until we can get  more.\"    \"Where?\" Did Thorvald know of some supply cache they could raid?    \"From the Throgs,\" the other answered matter of factly.    \"But they don't eat our kind of food....\"    \"All the more reason for them to leave the camp supplies untouched.\"    \"The camp?\"    For the first time Thorvald's lips curved in a shadow smile which was  neither joyous nor warming. \"A native raid on an invaders' camp. What  could be more natural? And we'd better make it soon.\"    \"But how can we?\" To Shann what the other proposed was sheer madness.    \"There was once an ancient service corps on Terra,\" Thorvald answered,  \"which had a motto something like this: 'The improbable we do at once;  the impossible takes a little longer.' What did you think we were going  to do? Sulk around out here in the bush and let the Throgs claim Warlock  for one of their pirate bases without opposition?\"    Since that was the only future Shann had visualized, he was ready enough  to admit the truth, only some shade of tone in the officer's voice kept  him from saying so aloud.          4. SORTIE      Five days later they came up from the south so that this time Shann's  view of the Terran camp was from a different angle. At first sight there  had been little change in the general scene. He wondered if the aliens  were using the Terran dome shelters themselves. Even in the twilight it  was easy to pick out such landmarks as the com dome with the shaft of a  broadcaster spearing from its top and the greater bulk of the supply  warehouse.    \"Two of their small flyers down on the landing field....\" Thorvald  materialized from the shadow, his voice a thread of whisper.    By Shann's side the wolverines were moving restlessly. Since Taggi's  attack on the Throg neither beast would venture near any site where they  could scent the aliens. This was the nearest point to which the men  could urge either animal, which was a disappointment, for the wolverines  would have been an excellent addition to the surprise sortie they  planned for tonight, halving the danger for the men.    Shann ran his fingers across the coarse fur on the animals' shoulders,  exerting a light pressure to signal them to wait. But he was not sure of  their obedience. The foray was a crazy idea, and Shann wondered again  why he had agreed to it. Yet he had gone along with Thorvald, even  suggested a few modifications and additions of his own, such as the  contents of the crude leaf sack now resting between his knees.    Thorvald flitted away, seeking his own post to the west. Shann was still  waiting for the other's signal when there arose from the camp a sound to  chill the flesh of any listener, a wail which could not have come from  the throat of any normal living thing, intelligent being or animal.  Ululating in ear-torturing intensity, the cry sank to a faint, ominous  echo of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#6)"],[1,"riend's twin brother.\"    Bart felt warmed and drawn, but sensibly he knew he could not keep up  the pretense. Sooner or later, he'd give himself away, use some habitual  phrase or gesture Tommy would recognize.    Should he take a chance--reveal himself to Tommy and ask him to keep  quiet? No. This wasn't a game. One man was already dead. He didn't want  Tommy to be next.    There was only one way out. He said coldly, \"thank you, but I have other  things to attend to. I intend to be very busy all through the voyage.\"  He spun on his heel and walked away before he could see Tommy's eager,  friendly smile turn hurt and defensive.    Back in his cabin, he gloomily dialed some synthetic jellies, thinking  with annoyance of the anticipated good food of the dining room. He knew  he couldn't risk meeting Tommy again, and drearily resigned himself to  staying in his cabin. It looked like an awfully boring trip ahead.    It was. It was a week before the Lhari ship went into warp-drive, and  all that time Bart stayed in his cabin, not daring to go to the  observation Lounge or dining hall. He got tired of eating synthetics  (oh, they were nourishing enough, but they were altogether  uninteresting) and tired of listening to the tapes the room steward got  him from the ship's library. By the time they had been in space a week,  he was so bored with his own company that even the Mentorian medic was a  welcome sight when he came in to prepare him for cold-sleep.    Bart had had the best education on Earth, but he didn't know precisely  how the Lhari warp-drive worked. He'd been told that only a few of the  Lhari understood it, just as the man who flew a copter didn't need to  understand Newton's Three Laws of Motion in order to get himself back  and forth to work.    But he knew this much; when the ship generated the frequencies which  accelerated it beyond the speed of light, in effect the ship went into a  sort of fourth dimension, and came out of it a good many light-years  away. As far as Bart knew, no human being had ever survived warp-drive  except in the suspended animation which they called cold-sleep. While  the medic was professionally reassuring him and strapping him in his  bunk, Bart wondered what humans would do with the Lhari star-drive if  they had it. Well, he supposed they could use automation in their ships.    The Mentorian paused, needle in hand. \"Do you wish to be wakened for the  week we shall spend in each of the Proxima, Sirius and Pollux systems,  sir? You can, of course, be given enough drug to keep you in cold-sleep  until we reach the Procyon system.\"    Bart wondered if the room steward had mentioned the passenger so bored  with the trip that he didn't even visit the Observation Lounge. He felt  tempted--he was getting awfully tired of staring at the walls. On the  other hand, he wanted very much to see the other star-systems. When he  passed through them on the trip to Earth, he'd been too young to pay  much attention.    Firmly he put the temptation aside. Better not to risk meeting other  passengers, Tommy especially, if he decided he couldn't take the  boredom.    The needle went into his arm. He felt himself sinking into sleep, and,  in sudden panic, realized that he was helpless. The ship would touch  down on three worlds, and on any of them the Lhari might have his  description, or his alias! He could be taken off, drugged and  unconscious, and might never wake up! He tried to move, to protest, to  tell them he was changing his mind, but already he was unable to speak.  There was a freezing moment of intense, painful cold. Then he was  floating in what felt like waves of cosmic dust, swirling many-colored  before his eyes. And then there was nothing, no color, nothing at all  except the nowhere night of sleep.          CHAPTER FOUR      Bart felt cold. He stirred, moved his head in drowsy protest; then  memory came flooding back, and in sudden panic he sat up, flinging out  his arms as if to ward away anyone who would lay hands on him.    \"Easy!\" said a soothing voice. A Mentorian--not the same Mentorian--bent  over him. \"We have just entered the gravitational field of Procyon  planet Alpha, Mr. Briscoe. Touchdown in four hours.\"    Bart mumbled an apology.    \"Think nothing of it. Quite a number of people who aren't used to the  cold-sleep drug suffer from minor lapses of memory. How do you feel  now?\"    Bart's legs were numb and his hands tingled when he sat up; but his body  processes had been slowed so much by the cold-sleep that he didn't even  feel hungry; the synthetic jelly he'd eaten just before going to sleep  wasn't even digested yet.    When the Mentorian left for another cabin, Bart looked around, and  suddenly felt he would stifle if he stayed here another minute. He  wasn't likely to run into Tommy twice in a row, and if he did, well,  Tommy would probably remember the snub he'd had and stay away from Dave  Briscoe. And he wanted another sight of the stars--before he went into  worry and danger.    He went down to the Observation Lounge.    The cosmic dust was brighter out here, and the constellations looked a  little flattened. Textbook tables came back to him. He had traveled 47  light-years--he couldn't remember how many _billions_ of miles that was.  Even so, it was only the tiniest hop-skip-and-jump in the measureless  vastness of space.    The ship was streaking toward Procyon, a sol-type star, bright yellow;  the three planets, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, ringed like Saturn and veiled  in shimmering layers of cloud, swung against the night. Past them other  stars, brighter stars, faraway stars he would never see, glimmered  through the pale dust....    \"Hello, Dave. Been space-sick all this time? Remember me? I met you  about six weeks ago in the lounge down here--just out from Earth.\"    _Oh, no!_ Bart turned, with a mental groan, to face Tommy. \"I've been in  cold-sleep,\" he said. He _couldn't_ be rude again.    \"What a dull way to face a long trip!\" Tommy said cheerily. \"I've  enjoyed every minute of it myself.\"    It was hard for Bart to realize that, for Tommy, their meeting had been  six weeks ago. It all seemed dreamlike. The closer he came to it, the  less he could realize that in a few hours he'd be getting off on a  strange world, with only the strange name _Raynor Three_ as a guide. He  felt terribly alone, and having Tommy close at hand helped, even though  Tommy didn't know he was helping.    \"Maybe I should have stayed awake.\"    \"You should,\" Tommy said. \"I only slept for a couple of hours at each  warp-drive shift. We had a day-long stopover at Sirius Eighteen, and I  took a tour of the planet. And I've spent a lot of time down here, just  star-gazing--not that it did me much good. Which one is Antares? How do  you tell it from Aldebaran? I'm always getting them mixed up.\"    Bart pointed. \"Aldebaran--that's the big red one there,\" he said. \"Think  of the constellation Taurus as a necklace, with Aldebaran hanging from  it like a locket. Antares is much further down in the sky, in relation  to the arbitrary sidereal axis, and it's a deeper red. Like a burning  coal, while Aldebaran is like a ruby--\"    He broke off in mid-word, realizing that Tommy was gazing at him in a  mixture of triumph and consternation. Too late, Bart realized he had  been tricked. Studying for an exam, the year before, he had explained  the difference between the two red stars in almost the same words.    \"Bart,\" Tommy said in a whisper, \"I knew it had to be you. Why didn't  you tell me, fella?\"    Bart felt himself start to smile, but it only stretched his mouth. He  said, very low, \"Don't say my name out loud Tom. I'm in terrible  trouble.\"    \"Why didn't you tell me? What's a friend for?\"    \"We can't talk here. And all the cabins are wired for sound in case  somebody stops breathing, or has a heart attack in space,\" Bart said,  glancing around.    They went and stood at the very foot of the quartz window, seeming to  tread the brink of a dizzying gulf of cosmic space, and talked in low  tones while Alpha and Beta and Gamma swelled like blown-up balloons in  the port.    Tommy listened, almost incredulous. \"And you're hoping to find your  father, with no more information than that? It's a big universe,\" he  said, waving at the gulf of stars. \"The Lhari ships, according to the  little tourist pamphlet they gave me, touch down at nine hundred and  twenty-two different stars in this galaxy!\"    Bart visibly winced, and Tommy urged, \"Come to Capella with me. You can  stay with my family as long as you want to, and appeal to the  Interplanet authority to find your father. They'd protect him against  the Lhari, surely. You can't chase all over the galaxy playing  interplanetary spy all by yourself, Bart!\"    But Briscoe had deliberately gone to his death, to give Bart the chance  to get away. He wouldn't have died to send Bart into a trap he could  easily have sprung on Earth.    \"Thanks, Tommy. But I've got to play it my way.\"    Tommy said firmly, \"Count me in then. My ticket has stopover privileges.  I'll get off at Procyon with you.\"    It was a temptation--to have a friend at his back. He put his hand on  Tommy's shoulder, grateful beyond words. But fresh horror seized him as  he remembered the horrible puddle of melted robotcab with Briscoe  somewhere in the residue. _Protoplasm residue enough for two bodies._ He  couldn't let Tommy face that.    \"Tommy, I appreciate that, believe me. But if I did find my father and  his friends, I don't want anyone tracing me. You'd only make the danger  worse. The best thing you can do is stay out of it.\"    Tommy faced him squarely. \"One thing's for sure. I'm not going to let  you go off and never know whether you're alive or dead.\"    \"I'll try to get a message to you,\" Bart said, \"if I can. But whatever  happens, Tommy, stay with the ship and go on to Capella. It's the one  thing you can do to help me.\"    A warning bell rang in the ship."]]]
