There once lived in Rambin, a town near the Baltic Sea, an honest,  industrious man named James Dietrich. He had several children, all of  a good disposition, especially the youngest, whose name was John. John  Dietrich was a handsome, smart boy, diligent at school, and obedient  at home. His great passion was for hearing stories, and whenever he  met any one who was well stored with such, he never let him go till he  had heard them all.    When John was about eight years old he was sent to spend a summer with  his uncle, a farmer in Rodenkirchen. Here he had to keep cows with  other boys, and they used to drive them to graze about the Nine-hills,  where an old cowherd, one Klas Starkwolt, frequently came to join the  lads, and then they would sit down all together and tell stories.  Consequently Klas became John's best friend, for he knew stories  without end. He could tell all about the Nine-hills, and the  underground folk who inhabited them; how the giants disappeared from  the country, and the dwarfs or little people came in their stead.  These tales John swallowed so eagerly that he thought of nothing else,  and was for ever talking of golden cups, and crowns, and glass shoes,  and pockets full of ducats, and gold rings, and diamond coronets, and  snow-white brides, and the like. Old Klas used often to shake his head  at him and say, \"John! John! what are you about? The spade and scythe  will be your sceptre and crown, and your bride will wear a garland of  rosemary and a gown of striped drill.\"    Still John almost longed to get into the Nine-hills, for Klas had told  him that any one who by luck or cunning should get the cap of one of  the little people might go down with safety, and instead of becoming  their slave, he would be their master. The fairy whose cap he got  would be his servant, and obey all his commands.    Midsummer-eve, when the days are longest and the nights shortest, was  now come. In the village of Rambin old and young kept the holiday, had  all sorts of plays, and told all kinds of stories. John, who knew that  this season was the time for all fairy-people to come abroad, could  now no longer contain himself, but the day after the festival he  slipped away to the Nine-hills, and when it grew dark laid himself  down on the top of the highest of them, which Klas had told him was  the principal dancing-ground of the underground people. John lay there  quite still from ten till twelve at night. At last it struck twelve.  Immediately there was a ringing and a singing in the hills, and then a  whispering and a lisping and a whiz and a buzz all about him, for the  little people were now come out, some whirling round and round in the  dance, and others sporting and tumbling about in the moonshine, and  playing a thousand merry pranks. He felt a secret dread creep over  him at this whispering and buzzing, for he could see nothing of them,  as the caps they wore made them invisible; but he lay quite still,  with his face in the grass and his eyes fast shut, snoring a little  just as if he was asleep. Yet now and then he ventured to open his  eyes a little and peep out, but not the slightest trace of them could  he see, though it was bright moonlight.    It was not long before three of the underground people came jumping up  to where he was lying; but they took no heed of him, and flung their  brown caps up into the air, and caught them from one another. At  length one snatched the cap out of the hand of another and flung it  away. It flew direct and fell upon John's head. He could feel, though  he could not see it; and the moment he did feel it, he caught hold of  it. Starting up, he swung it about for joy, and made the little silver  bell of it tingle, then set it upon his head, and--O wonderful to  relate!--that instant he saw the countless and merry swarm of the  little people.    The three little men came slily up to him, and thought by their  nimbleness to get back the cap, but he held his prize fast, and they  saw clearly that nothing was to be done in this way with him, for in  size and strength John was a giant in comparison of these little  fellows, who hardly reached his knee. The owner of the cap now came up  very humbly to the finder, and begged in as supplicating a tone as if  his life depended upon it, that he would give him back his cap. \"No,\"  said John, \"you sly little rogue, you'll get the cap no more. That's  not the sort of thing: I should be in a nice perplexity if I had not  something of yours; now you have no power over me, but must do what I  please. And I will go down with you, and see how you live below and  you shall be my servant.--Nay, no grumbling, you know you must. And I  know it too, just as well as you do, for Klas Starkwolt told it to me  often and often.\"    The little man made as if he had not heard or understood one word of  all this; he began all his crying and whining over again, and wept,  and screamed, and howled most piteously for his little cap. But John  cut the matter short by saying to him, \"Have done; you are my servant,  and I intend to take a trip with you.\" So the underground man gave up  the point; especially as he well knew there was no remedy.    John now flung away his old hat, and put on the cap, and set it firmly  on his head, lest it should slip off or fly away, for all his power  lay in it. He lost no time in trying its virtues, but commanded his  new servant to fetch him food and drink. The servant ran away like the  wind, and in a second was there again with bottles of wine, and bread,  and rich fruits. So John ate and drank, and looked on at the sports  and the dancing of the little people, and it pleased him right well,  and he behaved himself stoutly and wisely, as if he was a born master.    When the cock had now crowed for the third time, and the little larks  had made their first flutter in the sky, and the daybreak appeared in  slender white streaks in the east, then there went a whisper, hush,  hush, hush, through the bushes, and flowers, and trees; and the hills  rang again, and opened up, and the little men stole down and  disappeared. John gave close attention to every thing, and found that  it was exactly as he had been told. And behold! on the top of the hill  where they had just been dancing, and which was now full of grass and  flowers, as people see it by day, there rose, of a sudden, a small  glass door. Whosoever wanted to go in stepped upon this; it opened,  and he glided gently in, the glass closing again after him; and when  they had all entered it vanished, and there was no farther trace of it  to be seen. Those who descended through the glass door sank quite  gently into a wide silver tun or barrel, which held them all, and  could easily have harboured a thousand such little people. John and  his man went down also, along with several others, all of whom  screamed out and prayed him not to tread on them, for if his weight  came on them, they were dead men. He was, however, careful, and acted  in a very friendly way towards them. Several barrels of this kind went  up and down after each other, until all were in. They hung by long  silver chains, which were drawn and guided from below.    In his descent John was amazed at the wonderful brilliancy of the  walls between which the tun glided down. They seemed all studded with  pearls and diamonds, glittering and sparkling brightly, while below  him he heard the most beautiful music tinkling at a distance, so that  he did not know what he was about, and from excess of pleasure he fell  fast asleep.    He slept a long time, and when he awoke he found himself in the most  beautiful bed that could be, such as he had never seen in his father's  or any other house. It was also the prettiest little chamber in the  world, and his servant was beside him with a fan to keep away the  flies and gnats. He had hardly opened his eyes when his little servant  brought him a basin and towel, and held ready for him to put on the  nicest new clothes of brown silk, most beautifully made; with these  was a pair of new black shoes with red ribbons, such as John had never  beheld in Rambin or in Rodenkirchen either. There were also there  several pairs of glittering glass shoes, such as are only used on  great occasions. John was, we may well suppose, delighted to have such  clothes to wear, and he put them on joyfully. His servant then flew  like lightning and returned with a fine breakfast of wine and milk,  and delicate white bread and fruits, and such other things as little  boys are fond of. He now perceived, every moment, more and more, that  Klas Starkwolt, the old cowherd, knew what he was talking about, for  the splendour and magnificence here surpassed anything John had ever  dreamt of. His servant, too, was the most obedient one possible; a nod  or a sign was enough for him, for he was as wise as a bee, as all  these little people are by nature.    John's bedroom was all covered with emeralds and other precious  stones, and in the ceiling was a diamond as big as a nine-pin bowl,  that gave light to the whole chamber. In this place they have neither  sun, nor moon, nor stars to give them light; neither do they use lamps  or candles of any kind; but they live in the midst of precious stones,  and have the purest of gold and silver in abundance, from which they  manage to obtain light both by day and by night, though indeed,  properly speaking, as there is no sun here, there is no distinction of  day and night, and they reckon only by weeks. They set the brightest  and clearest precious stones in their dwellings, and the ways and  passages leading under the ground, and in the places where they have  their large halls, and their dances and feasts; and the sparkle of  these jewels makes a sort of silvery twilight which is far more  beautiful than common day.

To what era may we assign the introduction of the Anglo-Norman style?    A. To the reign of Edward the Confessor, since that monarch is recorded by  the historians, Matthew Paris and William of Malmesbury, to have rebuilt  (A. D. 1065) the Abbey Church at Westminster in a new style of  architectural design, which furnished an example afterwards followed by  many in the construction of churches.[52-*]    Q. Is any portion of the structure erected by Edward the Confessor  remaining?    A. A crypt of early Norman work under the present edifice or buildings  attached to it is supposed to have been part of the church constructed by  that monarch.    Q. During what period of time did this style prevail?    A. From about A. D. 1065 to the close of the twelfth century.    Q. By what means are we to distinguish this style from the styles of a  later period?    A. It is distinguished without difficulty by its semicircular arches, its  massive piers, which are generally square or cylindrical, though sometimes  multangular in form, and from numerous ornamental details and mouldings  peculiar to the style.    Q. What part of the original building has generally been preserved in  those churches that were built by the Normans, when all the rest has been  demolished and rebuilt in a later style of architecture?    [Illustration: Norman Doorway, Wolston Church, Warwickshire.]    A. There appears to have been a prevalent custom, among those architects  who succeeded the Normans, to preserve the doorways of those churches they  rebuilt or altered; for many such doorways still remain in churches, the  other portions of which were built at a much later period. Thus in the  tower of Kenilworth Church, Warwickshire, is a Norman doorway of singular  design, from the square band or ornamental facia which environs it. This  is a relic of a more ancient edifice than the structure in which it now  appears, and which is of the fourteenth century; and the external masonry  of the doorway is not tied into the walls of more recent construction, but  exhibits a break all round. The church of Stoneleigh, in the same county,  contains in the north wall a fine Norman doorway, which has been left  undisturbed, though the wall on each side of Norman construction, has been  altered, not by demolition, but by the insertion, in the fourteenth  century, of decorated windows in lieu of the original small Norman lights.    Q. Were the Norman doorways much ornamented?    A. Many rich doorways were composed of a succession of receding  semicircular arches springing from rectangular-edged jambs, and detached  shafts with capitals in the nooks; which shafts, together with the arches,  were often enriched with the mouldings common to this style. Sometimes the  sweep of mouldings which faced the architrave was continued without  intermission down the jambs or sides of the doorway; and in small country  churches Norman doorways, quite plain in their construction, or with but  few mouldings, are to be met with. There is, perhaps, a greater variety of  design in doorways of this than of any other style; and of the numerous  mouldings with which they in general abound more or less, the chevron, or  zig-zag, appears to have been the most common.    Q. In what other respect were these doors sometimes ornamented?    A. The semicircular-shaped stone, which we often find in the tympanum at  the back of the head of the arch, is generally covered with rude sculpture  in basso relievo, sometimes representing a scriptural subject, as the  temptation of our first parents on the tympanum of a Norman doorway at  Thurley Church, Bedfordshire; sometimes a legend, as a curious and very  early sculpture over the south door of Fordington Church, Dorsetshire,  representing a scene in the story of St. George; and sometimes symbolical,  as the representation of fish, serpents, and chimerae on the north doorway  of Stoneleigh Church, Warwickshire. The figure of our Saviour in a sitting  attitude, holding in his left hand a book, and with his right arm and hand  upheld, in allusion to the saying, _I am the way, and the truth, and the  life_, and circumscribed by that mystical figure the _Vesica piscis_,  appears over Norman doorways at Ely Cathedral; Rochester Cathedral;  Malmesbury Abbey Church; Elstow Church, Bedfordshire; Water Stratford  Church, Buckinghamshire; and Barfreston Church, Kent; and is not  uncommon.    Q. Are there many Norman porches?    A. Norman porches occur at Durham Cathedral; Malmesbury Abbey Church;  Sherbourne Abbey Church; and Witney Church, Oxfordshire; but they are not  very common. The roof of the porch was usually groined with simple cross  springers and moulded ribs; and in some instances a room over has been  added at a later period. Numerous portals of the Norman era appear  constructed within a shallow projecting mass of masonry, similar in  appearance to the broad projecting buttress, and, like that, finished on  the upper edge with a plain slope. This was to give a sufficiency of depth  to the numerous concentric arches successively receding in the thickness  of the wall, which could not otherwise be well attained.    Q. What kind of windows were those belonging to this style?    A. The windows were mostly small and narrow, seldom of more than one  light, except belfry windows, which were usually divided into two  round-headed lights by a shaft, with a capital and abacus. Early in the  style the windows were quite plain; afterwards they were ornamented in a  greater or less degree, sometimes with the chevron or zig-zag, and  sometimes with roll or cylinder mouldings; in many instances, also, shafts  were inserted at the sides, the window jambs were simply splayed in one  direction only, and the space between them increased in width inwardly.    [Illustration: Norman Window, Ryton Church, Warwickshire.]    Q. Do we meet with any circular or wheel-shaped windows of the Norman era?    A. A circular window, with divisions formed by small shafts and  semicircular or trefoiled arches, disposed so as to converge to a common  centre, sometimes occurs in the gable at the east end of a Norman church,  as at Barfreston Church, Kent; and New Shoreham Church, Sussex; and are  not uncommon.    [Illustration: Early Norman Window, Darent Church, Kent, with incipient  zig-zag moulding.]    Q. What kinds of piers were the Norman piers?    A. Early in the style they were (with some exceptions, as in the crypts  beneath the cathedrals of Canterbury and Worcester) very massive, and the  generality plain and cylindrical; though sometimes they were square, which  was indeed the most ancient shape; sometimes they appear with rectangular  nooks or recesses; and, in large churches, Norman piers had frequently one  or more semicylindrical pier-shafts attached, disposed either in nooks or  on the face of the pier. We sometimes meet with octagonal piers, as in the  cathedrals of Oxford and Peterborough, the conventual church at Ely, and  in the ruined church of Buildwas Abbey, Salop; and also, though rarely,  with piers covered with spiral flutings, as one is in Norwich Cathedral;  with the spiral cable moulding, as one is in the crypt of Canterbury  Cathedral; and encircled with a spiral band, as one appears in the ruined  chapel at Orford, in Suffolk; sometimes, also, they appear covered with  ornamental mouldings. Late in the style the piers assume a greater  lightness in appearance, and are sometimes clustered and banded round with  mouldings, and approximate in design those of a subsequent style.    Q. How are the capitals distinguished?    A. The general outline and shape of the Norman capital is that of a square  cubical mass, having the lower part rounded off with a contour resembling  that of an ovolo moulding; the face on each side of the upper part of the  capital is flat, and it is often separated from the lower part by an  escalloped edge; and where such division is formed by more than one  escallop, the lower part is channelled between each, and the spaces below  the escalloped edges are worked or moulded so as to resemble inverted and  truncated semicones.    [Illustration: Norman Capital, Steetley Church, Derbyshire.]    Besides the plain capital thus described, of which instances with the  single escalloped edge occur in the crypts beneath the cathedrals of  Canterbury, Winchester, and Worcester, and with a series of escalloped  edges, or what would be heraldically termed _invected_, in many of the  capitals of the Norman piers in Norwich Cathedral, an extreme variety of  design in ornamental accessories prevail, the general form and outline of  the capital being preserved; and some exhibit imitations of the Ionic  volute and Corinthian acanthus, whilst many are covered with rude  sculpture in relief. They are generally finished with a plain square  abacus moulding, with the under edge simply bevelled or chamfered;  sometimes a slight angular moulding occurs between the upper face and  slope of the abacus, and sometimes the abacus alone intervenes between the  pier and the spring of the arch. There are also many round capitals, as,  for instance, those in the nave of Gloucester Cathedral, but they are  mostly late in the style.    [Illustration: Norman Arcade, St. Augustine's, Canterbury.]    Q. What is observable in the bases of the piers?    A. The common base moulding resembles in form or contour a quirked ovolo  reversed; there are, however, many exceptions.    [Illustration: Norman Base, Romsey Church, Hants.]    Q. How are the arches distinguished?    A. By their semicircular form; they are"]]]
